INTRODUCTION.

During my visit to the Southwest, in the summer of 1885, it was my good fortune to arrive at
the Navajo Reservation a few days before the commencement of a Navajo healing ceremonial. Learning
of the preparation for this, I decided to remain and observe the ceremony, which was to continue
nine days and nights. The occasion drew to the place some 1,200 Navajos. The scene of the assemblage
was an extensive plateau near the margin of Keam’s Canyon, Arizona.

A variety of singular and interesting occurrences attended this great event—mythologic rites,
gambling, horse and foot racing, general merriment, and curing the sick, the latter being the
prime cause of the gathering. A man of distinction in the tribe was threatened with loss of
vision from inflammation of the eyes, having looked upon certain masks with an irreligious
heart. He was rich and had many wealthy relations, hence the elaborateness of the ceremony
of healing. A celebrated theurgist was solicited to officiate, but much anxiety was felt when
it was learned that his wife was pregnant. A superstition prevails among the Navajo that a
man must not look upon a sand painting when his wife is in a state of gestation, as it would
result in the loss of the life of the child. This medicine man, however, came, feeling that
he possessed ample power within himself to avert such calamity by administering to the child
immediately after its birth a mixture in water of all the sands used in the painting. As I
have given but little time to the study of Navajo mythology, I can but briefly mention such
events as I witnessed, and record the myths only so far as I was able to collect them hastily.
I will first describe the ceremony of Yebitchai and give then the myths (some complete and
others incomplete) explanatory of the gods and genii figuring in the Hasjelti Dailjis (dance
of Hasjelti) and in the nine days’ ceremonial, and then others independent of these.
