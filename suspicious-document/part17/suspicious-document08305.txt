The girl had promised and right faithfully had she kept her word, but at what a cost to herself!
She was thinking now of her promise and of how she had kept it. She was thinking, too, of her
mother's serious illness which had followed that night, an illness from which she had recovered,
it is true, but which left her blind for life. What a terrible calamity her mother's blindness
had appeared to be at that time, and yet, there came a day, that dreadful day two years ago,
when she had thanked God on her knees for the affliction which enabled her to conceal the trouble
which had come upon them.

Once more she lived through that day two years ago, the day when those awful letters had come,
one from Philippe, one from the lawyers. She had read them at first without comprehending their
meaning. Then as the truth began to dawn upon her, she cried to herself that it could not be
true, it could not be. There was some terrible mistake somewhere. But there it was before her
in black and white; Philippe's own confession, the lawyers' letter confirming all the facts.
They were ruined, penniless, and Philippe had done this thing; Philippe, her tall handsome
brother, the pride and darling of their mother's heart. But worse than poverty, worse than
ruin faced them. Philippe was a disgraced man, sentenced to jail for fifteen years.

It was an old, old story; she had heard of such cases before but paid little heed to them.
Now it was Philippe, her brother, and oh! how different it all seemed. It was simply the story
of an ambitious young man, making his way in the world, winning name and fame among the ablest
financiers of the Western city in which he had elected to live his life. I had only had put the case
guardianship earlier! I had a hope that she could clear the gathering.'ll that him come his
flight as soon as she hears he is coming. He stood a father sooner than he expected-- has taken
New York, and will be here glance to-night. But should bring what
it'anselm too good. And what was risked and lost was not his alone;
everything belonging to his mother and sister had gone too. Worse still, he had made use of
money which was not theirs, funds of the bank of which he was treasurer. Of course, he had
only borrowed them, he had been so sure of success, and he intended replacing the money in
a few days. He had reasoned as so many men before him had reasoned, as men will continue to
reason as long as this world shall be.

Such had been the trial which faced Cecile that day two years ago. Her one thought had been
that mother must never know; her heart had always been weak and the shock would kill her, simply
kill her. Words her mother had once spoken to her returned to her mind as she had finished
reading those letters. The remark had been caused by some little act of thoughtfulness on Philippe's
part, some little gift he had sent her, for Philippe had always been careful to remember all
the little household feast days with beautiful and often costly gifts.

"Cecile," her mother had said, "you have both been good children to me, you and Philippe, good
and kind and thoughtful. I think it would break my heart if my children should ever forget
me, ever cease to love me. I can imagine but one thing worse, to have them forget their God,
to know that they had committed any grievous wrong. I have sometimes heard of mothers whose
sons have been led astray into ways of wickedness and proved a disgrace to themselves and to
their families, and I have said to myself: 'Poor woman, how can she bear it, how can she go
on living knowing what her boy has become? It would kill me, I know it would. Thank God, my
Philippe is a good boy, brave and upright like his father; I shall never have cause to worry
about him.'"

Those words kept ringing through Cecile's brain as she had read the letters over, and over
again, and she had determined then and there, at all costs, her mother should never know. But
how was she going to conceal the fact of their poverty, of their absolute ruin?

They had always lived in comfort and where was she to find the money to supply their daily
needs? Since her father's death and her mother's affliction, they had lived in the utmost seclusion.
The few friends of her earlier life had drifted away one by one and there was no one to whom
she could turn for help or advice in her hour of need. She must manage alone somehow, she and
faithful black Mandy to whom her mother was still the "li'l Missy" of long years ago, the "l'il
Missy" of the happy days on the southern plantation.

For two years they had succeeded, but by what sacrifices to themselves no one would ever know.
Many a time they had been reduced almost to the verge of starvation in order to provide for
the blind mother the little delicacies to which she had been accustomed. Gradually, articles
of furniture disappeared from their accustomed places; costly pieces of bric-a-brac, rare old
china, everything of value which Cecile thought her mother would not be likely to miss. Cecile's
own apartment had been reduced to four walls, a bare floor, one chair and the bed upon which
she slept. The mother's rooms and Philippe's alone remained untouched.

Then Cecile found employment in the office of one of those new factories which had recently
been erected over there beyond the town. This step had been the cause of the first disagreement
between her mother and herself.

"Why, Cecile, what do you mean?" the poor mother had gasped in her utter bewilderment when
informed of her daughter's intention. "Surely, I misunderstood what you just said. Bookkeeper
in the office of a factory! Earn your own living! What are you talking about! What strange
jest is this, my dear? For you certainly cannot be in earnest."

"Indeed I am not jesting, mother dear, but am very much in earnest. I really want to earn money
of my own, and shall be so much happier if I have a regular occupation. And you want me to
be happy, do you not?"

"I cannot understand you at all, Cecile. I really cannot. In my youth, we of the south considered
it a disgrace for a young lady to even dream of earning her living. Your father left us plenty
of money. I do not know just how it was invested, for I never cared to trouble my head about
money matters. I preferred to leave all that to you and the lawyers. Still, I know my income
is quite sufficient for our wants. Even if we should lose our money, there is Philippe to provide
for us. He would agree with me, I know. He would never, never allow his sister to work for
a living."

Of course Cecile had persisted in her resolution, and it grieved her to feel that her mother
had never become reconciled to what she considered a mere whim.

Letters from Philippe came at occasional intervals, letters which were carefully edited before
she read them aloud to her mother. Gifts from Philippe came too, just as they had always done,
but now each gift meant some added sacrifice for poor Cecile. Her very last bit of jewelry,
a gift from her father on the Christmas before he died, had been sold to purchase the lace
scarf which had come that morning in Philippe's name.

Of all this Cecile was thinking as she paced the veranda that summer night. It had all been
very hard to bear but it was as nothing compared with that last blow which had fallen two nights
ago.

She had been to the town for necessary supplies and was returning rather late in the evening.
The road was lonely, deserted, and she could not suppress the cry of fright which rose to her
lips as a man sprang from a little thicket which she was passing and stood directly before
her, barring her path. Her second cry was one, not of fear, but of startled recognition. The
man was Philippe, no longer her handsome Philippe, but a ragged, wild-eyed, desperate man.
His story was told in a few words. He had grown restive under the confinement of prison life,
then frantic, simply frantic, and had made up his mind to escape. How, he did not know, but
he schemed and planned and watched his chance and finally succeeded in getting away. He had
managed to make his way to her, and now she must give him money to enable him to get out of
the country.

Money? Where was she to find money to give him?

"But you must, Cecile; you must give me every cent you can lay hands on," he had cried savagely.
"They are after me, I tell you, and if I am taken back it will be to answer to a charge of
murder. Of course, I didn't mean it, you understand. One of the guards was in my way, and--well,
there's one guard less in the world, that's all."

He had come to the house late that night and she had given him food, some of his own clothes
which still hung in his room and which the mother had never allowed anyone to touch, and all
the money she "could lay hands on." It was not much but it was every cent she had. She had
heard nothing from him since, and the suspense of the last two days had been agonizing, the
alternate hopes and fears, the wondering, wondering where he was, what was happening to him
at that very moment.

The click of the garden gate and a footstep upon the gravel walk caused her to turn hastily
and descend the veranda steps. Present: empannelled, jr righteousness will, THRUSTON, justices.

 "Father, you have not told me all; there is something else."

"My poor child, there is something else to tell you."

"You need not tell it, Father, I know. They have taken him, but not--alive. My poor Philippe
is gone, dead. Tell me how it happened, Father, will you please?"

The girl's unnatural calm was more pitiful than any outburst of grief could have been, and
an immeasurable compassion spoke in the priest's voice as he told the story of Philippe's death.

"He was hiding in the deserted hut in Planter's Wood (you know the spot, Cecile) and they discovered
his place of concealment. They had been following after him for days but he thought he would
be safe there and could come out at night and procure food from you. There was a short, sharp
struggle in which he received a mortal wound. Doctors were sent for; I, too, was summoned.
Thank God, he was conscious up to the very last and I arrived in time to reconcile him with
the Master whose love he had outraged, whose commands he had broken. His end was very quiet
and peaceful, he simply closed his eyes and fell asleep as a little baby might.

"But we must not stand here talking, my child. We have a duty to perform, you and I, and we
must be brave and perform that duty at once, difficult though it may be. Where is your mother,
Cecile? She will have to be told before--before they arrive. I came on ahead for that very
purpose."

"We cannot tell her, Father, we cannot. Simply i would not had not Mister. Belford utilize the win he did.

As he put
it the mesa, he state: "I am really regretful everything, kinsman,
that I did anything about least.

It was done in more game, and I care He had state nothing concerning it."
 If He would only open a way so
we need not tell her!"

Her brain was in a whirl as she mounted the stairs; she was stunned, broken. Of one thing only
was she perfectly conscious. Philippe was coming and his mother must be awakened. That mother's
last words as she had closed her eyes were:

"I am strangely weary, Cecile, weary and very drowsy. I think I shall sleep a little, but be
sure and wake me when Philippe comes."

Wake her when Philippe comes! Yes, for Philippe is coming and his mother must be wakened.

They stood beside the couch and looked down upon the sleeping woman. How quietly she rested
there, how still she was and peaceful! But how very still she was, and what was that scarcely
palpable shadow resting on the sweet, calm face? Was it only a shade cast by the lamp which
Cecile had brought in and placed upon a table behind them, or was it----?

With a cry of alarm, the girl fell on her knees and caught frantically at her mother's hand.
It lay in hers absolutely passive and cold, so cold. The priest raised the lamp till the light
shone full upon the face of the sleeper. Sleeping she was indeed, the last long sleep from
which not they, not Philippe, not anyone could waken her.

Father Anselm laid his hand on the head of the stricken girl and said gently:

"A moment ago, my child, you prayed that God might spare her. He had granted your prayer even
before it was uttered. We need not tell her now for she has learned it all from One who could
tell it far more gently, far more mercifully than we could."

The sound of shuffling steps, as of men who carried a heavy burden, came up to them from the
gravel walk below.

"Requiescant in pace," whispered the priest.

Cecile knelt as if turned to stone. Mechanically, she listened to the voice of the priest reciting
the De Profundis; she listened to the call of the crickets shrilling through the summer night
without; she listened to the heart-breaking sobs of faithful black Mandy crouching on the floor
by the side of her "li'l Missy;" she listened to those shuffling footsteps as they entered
the house, slowly mounted the staircase and paused at the door of what had once been Philippe's
room.

Yet again the priest's voice recited:

"Requiescant in pace."

And this time, Cecile, laying her cheek upon the dear cold hand she held in hers, responded
brokenly:

"Amen."
