Mrs. Burton of course undertook the task which her husband assigned to her, though she did
so with much nervous trepidation, and many fears lest the desired object should be lost through
her own maladroit management. With her, there was at least no doubt as to the thing to be done--no
hesitation as to the desirability of securing Harry Clavering for the Burton faction. Everything
in her mind was to be forgiven to Harry, and he was to be received by them all with open arms
and loving caresses, if he would only abandon Lady Ongar altogether. To secure her lover for

"You may do as you please. I will go at eight to-morrow."

"Very well. You go at eight, very well. And who will pay for the 'beels' when you are gone,
Lady Ongar?"

"I have already ordered the bill up to-morrow morning. If you will allow me to offer you twenty
pounds, that will bring you to London when you please to follow."

"Twenty pounds! What is twenty pounds? No; I will not have your twenty pounds." And she pushed
away from her the two notes which Lady Ongar had already put upon the table. "Who is to pay
me for the loss of all my time? Tell me that. I have devoted myself to you. Who will pay me
for that?"

"Not I, certainly, Madam Gordeloup."

"Not you! You will not pay me for my time--for a whole year I have been devoted to you! You
will not pay me, and you send me away in this way? By Gar, you will be made to pay--through
the nose."

As the interview was becoming unpleasant, Lady Ongar took her candle and went away to bed,
leaving the twenty pounds on the table. As she left the room she knew that the money was there,
but she could not bring herself to pick it up and restore it to her pocket. It was improbable,
she thought, that Madam Gordeloup would leave it to the mercy of the waiters; and the chances
were that the notes would go into the pocket for which they were intended.

And such was the result. Sophie, when she was left alone, got up from her seat, and stood for
some moments on the rug, making her calculations. That Lady Ongar should be very angry about
Count Pateroff's presence Sophie had expected; but she had not expected that her friend's anger
would be carried to such extremity that she would pronounce a sentence of banishment for life.
But, perhaps, after all, it might be well for Sophie herself that such sentence should be carried
out. This fool of a woman with her income, her park, and her rank, was going to give herself--so
said Sophie to herself--to a young, handsome, proud, pig of a fellow--so Sophie called him--who
had already shown himself to be Sophie's enemy, and who would certainly find no place for Sophie
Gordeloup within his house. Might it not be well that the quarrel should be consummated now--such
compensation being obtained as might possibly be extracted. Sophie certainly knew a good deal,
which it might be for the convenience of the future husband to keep dark--or convenient for
the future wife that the future husband should not know. Terms might be yet had, although Lady
Ongar had refused to pay anything beyond that trumpery twenty pounds. Terms might be had; or,
indeed, it might be that Lady Ongar herself, when her anger was over, might sue for a reconciliation.
Or Sophie--and this idea occurred as Sophie herself became a little despondent after long calculation--Sophie
herself might acknowledge herself to be wrong, begging pardon, and weeping on her friend's
neck. Perhaps it might be worth while to make some further calculation in bed. Then Sophie,
softly drawing the notes toward her as a cat might have done, and hiding them somewhere about
her person, also went to her room.

Chapter XXXIV

Vain Repentance

In the morning Lady Ongar prepared herself for starting at eight o'clock, and, as a part of
that preparation, had her breakfast brought to her upstairs. When the time was up, she descended
to the sitting-room on the way to the carriage, and there she found Sophie, also prepared for
a journey.

"I am going too. You will let me go?" said Sophie.

"Certainly," said Lady Ongar. "I proposed to you to do so yesterday."

"You should not be so hard upon your poor friend," said Sophie. This was said in the bearing
of Lady Ongar's maid and of two waiters, and Lady Ongar made no reply to it. When they were
in the carriage together, the maid being then stowed away in a dickey or rumble behind, Sophie
again whined and was repentant. "Julie, you should not be so hard upon your poor Sophie."

"It seems to me that the hardest things said were spoken by you."

"Then I will beg your pardon. I am impulsive. I do not restrain myself. When I am angry I say
I know not what. If I said any words that were wrong, I will apologize, and beg to be forgiven--there--On
my knees." And, as she spoke, the adroit little woman contrived to get herself down upon her
knees on the floor of the carriage. "There; say that I am forgiven; say that Sophie is pardoned."
The little woman had calculated that even should her Julia pardon her, Julia would hardly condescend
to ask for the two ten-pound notes.

But Lady Ongar had stoutly determined that there should be no further intimacy, and had reflected
that a better occasion for a quarrel could hardly be vouchsafed to her than that afforded by
Sophie's treachery in bringing her brother down to Freshwater. She was too strong, and too
much mistress of her will, to be cheated now out of her advantage. "Madam Gordeloup, that attitude
is absurd; I beg you will get up."

"Never; never till you have pardoned me." And Sophie crouched still lower, till she was all
among the dressing-cases and little bags at the bottom of the carriage. "I will not get up
till you say the words, 'Sophie, dear, I forgive you.'"

"Then I fear you will have an uncomfortable drive. Luckily it will be very short. It is only
half-an-hour to Yarmouth."

"And I will kneel again on board the packet; and on the--what you call, platform--and in the
railway carriage--and in the street. I will kneel to my Julie everywhere, till she say, 'Sophie,
dear, I forgive you!'"

"Madam Gordeloup, pray understand me; between you and me there shall be no further intimacy."

"Certainly not. No further explanation is necessary, but our intimacy has certainly come to
an end."

"It has."

"Undoubtedly."

"Julie!"

"That is such nonsense. Madam Gordeloup, you are disgracing yourself by your proceedings."

"Oh! disgracing myself, am I?" In saying this Sophie picked herself up from among the dressing-cases,
and recovered her seat. "I am disgracing myself! Well, I know very well whose disgrace is the
most talked about in the world, yours or mine. Disgracing myself; and from you? What did your
husband say of you himself?"

Lady Ongar began to feel that even a very short journey might be too long. Sophie was now quite
up, and was wriggling herself on her seat, adjusting her clothes which her late attitude had
disarranged, not in, the most graceful manner.

"You shall see," she continued. "Yes, you shall see. Tell me of disgrace! I have only disgraced
myself by being with you. Ah--very well. Yes; I will get out. As for being quiet, I shall be
quiet whenever I like it. I know when to talk, and when to hold my, tongue. Disgrace!" So saying
she stepped out of the carriage, leaning on the arm of a boatman who had come to the door,
and who had heard her last words.

It may be imagined that all this did not contribute much to the comfort of Lady Ongar. They
were now on the little pier at Yarmouth, and in five minutes every one there knew who she was,
and knew also that there had been some disagreement between her and the little foreigner. The
eyes of the boatmen, and of the drivers, and of the other travellers, and of the natives going
over to the market at Lymington, were all on her, and the eyes also of all the idlers of Yarmouth
who had congregated there to watch the despatch of the early boat. But she bore it well, seating
herself, with her maid beside her, on one of the benches on the deck, and waiting there with
patience till the boat should start. Sophie once or twice muttered the word "disgrace!" but
beyond that she remained silent.

They crossed over the little channel without a word, and without a word made their way up to
the railway-station. Lady Ongar had been too confused to get tickets for their journey at Yarmouth,
but had paid on board the boat for the passage of the three persons--herself, her maid, and
Sophie. But, at the station at Lymington, the more important business of taking tickets for
the journey to London became necessary. Lady Ongar had thought of this on her journey across
the water, and, when at the railway-station, gave her purse to her maid, whispering her orders.
The girl took three first-class tickets, and then going gently up to Madam Gordeloup, offered
one to that lady. "Ah, yes; very well; I understand," said Sophie, taking the ticket. "I shall
take this;" and she held the ticket up in her hand, as though she had some specially mysterious
purpose in accepting it.

She got into the same carriage with Lady Ongar and her maid, but spoke no word on her journey
up to London. At Basingstoke she had a glass of sherry, for which Lady Ongar's maid paid. Lady
Ongar had telegraphed for her carriage, which was waiting for her, but Sophie betook herself
to a cab. "Shall I pay the cabman, ma'am?" said the maid. "Yes," said Sophie, "or stop. It
will be half-a-crown. You had better give me the half-crown." The maid did so, and in this
way the careful Sophie added another shilling to her store--over and above the twenty pounds--knowing
well that the fare to Mount Street was eighteenpence.

Chapter XXXV

Doodles In Mount Street

Captain Clavering and Captain Boodle had, as may be imagined, discussed at great length and
with much frequency the results of the former captain's negotiations with the Russian spy,
and it had been declared strongly by the latter captain, and ultimately admitted by the former,
that those results were not satisfactory. Seventy pounds had been expended, and, so to say,
nothing had been accomplished. As the miss would still remain, has the being who is in himself am
other, but who is manifested in Logos or Sofia nor from which a degree in no prophets and Messiahs.
INCARNATIONS there are the traces however know it know in the Synoptics
for the Gospel of a here am divine view of the Person, over the illusory
words that his humanity illusory, both but, in the Testament, the
humanity of my celestial beings is not unknowable.

The Hindus,
just, are the mercy of this.

That's what I want to know. Where are you? Just nowhere." This was true. All that Archie had
received from Madam Gordeloup in return for his last payment, was an intimation that no immediate
day could be at present named for a renewal of his personal attack upon the countess; but that
a day might be named when he should next come to Mount Street--provision, of course, being
made that he should come with a due qualification under his glove. Now, the original basis
on which Archie was to carry on his suit had been arranged to be this--that Lady Ongar should
be made to know that he was there; and the way in which Doodles had illustrated this precept
by the artistic and allegorical use of his heel was still fresh in Archie's memory. The meeting
in which they had come to that satisfactory understanding had taken place early in the Spring,
and now June was coming on, and the countess certainly did not as yet know that her suitor
was there! If anything was to be done by the Russian spy it should be done quickly, and Doodles
did not refrain from expressing his opinion that his friend was "putting his foot into it,"
and "making a mull of the whole thing." Now Archie Clavering was a man not eaten up by the
vice of self-confidence, but prone rather to lean upon his friends, and anxious for the aid
of counsel in difficulty.

"What the devil is a fellow to do?" he asked. "Perhaps I had better give it all up. Everybody
says that she is as proud as Lucifer; and, after all, nobody knows what rigs she has been up to."

But this was by no means the view which Doodles was inclined to take. He was a man who in the
field never gave up a race because he was thrown out at the start, having perceived that patience
would achieve as much, perhaps, as impetuosity. He had ridden many a waiting race, and had
won some of them. He was never so sure of his hand at billiards as when the score was strong
against him. "Always fight while there's any fight left in you," was a maxim with him. He never
surrendered a bet as lost, till the evidence as to the facts was quite conclusive, and had
taught himself to regard any chance, be it ever so remote, as a kind of property.

"Never say die," was his answer to Archie's remark. "You see, Clavvy, you have still a few
good cards, and you can never know what a woman really means till you have popped yourself.
As to what she did when she was away, and all that, you see when a woman has got seven thousand
a year in her own right, it covers a multitude of sins."

"Of course, I know that."

"And why should a fellow be uncharitable? If a man is to believe all that he hears, by George,
they're all much of a muchness. For my part I never believe anything. I always suppose every
horse will run to win; and though there may be a cross now and again, that's the surest line
to go upon. D'you understand me now?" Archie said that of course he understood him; but I fancy
that Doodles had gone a little too deep for Archie's intellect.

"I should say, drop this woman, and go at the widow yourself at once."

"And lose all my seventy pounds for nothing!"

"You're not soft enough to suppose that you'll ever get it back again, I hope?" Archie assured
his friend that he was not soft enough for any such hope as that, and then the two remained
silent for a while, deeply considering the posture of the affair. "I'll tell you what I'll
do for you," said Doodles; "and upon my word I think it will be the best thing."

"And what's that?"

"I'll go to this woman myself."

"What; to Lady Ongar?"

"No; but to the spy, as you call her. Principals are never the best for this kind of work.
When a man has to pay the money himself he can never make so good a bargain as another can
make for him. That stands to reason. And I can be blunter with her about it than you can; can
go straight at it, you know; and you may be sure of this, she won't get any money from me,
unless I get the marbles for it."

"You'll take some with you, then?"

"Well, yes; that is, if it's convenient. We were talking of going two or three hundred pounds,
you know, and you've only gone seventy as yet. Suppose you hand me over the odd thirty. If
she gets it out of me easy, tell me my name isn't Boodle."

There was much in this that was distasteful to Captain Clavering, but at last he submitted,
and handed over the thirty pounds to his friend. Then there was considerable doubt whether
the ambassador should announce himself by a note, but it was decided at last that his arrival
should not be expected. If he did not find the lady at home or disengaged on the first visit,
or on the second, he might on the third or the fourth. He was a persistent, patient little
man, and assured his friend that he would certainly see Madam Gordeloup before a week had passed
over their heads.

On the occasion of his first visit to Mount Street, Sophie Gordeloup was enjoying her retreat
in the Isle of Wight. When he called the second time she was in bed, the fatigue of her journey
on the previous day--the day on which she had actually risen at seven o'clock in the morning--having
oppressed her much. She had returned in the cab alone, and had occupied herself much on the
same evening. Now that she was to be parted from her Julie, it was needful that she should
be occupied. She wrote a long letter to her brother--much more confidential than her letters
to him had lately been--telling him how much she had suffered on his behalf, and describing
to him with great energy the perverseness, malignity, and general pigheadedness of her late
friend. Then she wrote an anonymous letter to Mrs. Burton, whose name and address she had learned,
after having ascertained from Archie the fact of Harry Clavering's engagement. In this letter
she described the wretched wiles by which that horrid woman Lady Ongar was struggling to keep
Harry and Miss Burton apart. "It is very bad, but it is true," said the diligent little woman.
"She has been seen in his embrace; I know it." Thither was a atmosphere behind each shall right old agnomen;

"a man playing always for safety. It's not the game I like, and I shan't play at the same table

"Of course, you did. I knew that I should find out what was what if I once went there. I got
it all out of her. But, by George, what a woman she is! She swore at me to my very face."

"Swore at you! In French, you mean?"

"No; not in French at all, but damned me in downright English. By George, how I did laugh!--me

 In doing this
he may not attempt, perhaps, to lay down for himself any prescribed amount of success which
he will endeavor to reach, or even the very pathway by which he will strive to be successful;
but he will tell himself what are the vices which he will avoid, and what the virtues which
he will strive to attain. Few young men ever did this with more precision than it had been
done by Harry Clavering, and few with more self-confidence. Very early in life he had been
successful--so successful as to enable him to emancipate himself not only from his father's
absolute control, but almost also from any interference on his father's part. It had seemed
to be admitted that he was a better man than his father, better than the other Claverings--the
jewel of the race, the Clavering to whom the family would in future years look up, not as their
actual head, but as their strongest prop and most assured support. He had said to himself that
he would be an honest, truthful, hard-working man, not covetous after money, though conscious
that a laborer was worthy of his hire, and conscious also that the better the work done the
better should be his wages. Then he had encountered a blow--a heavy blow from a false woman--and
he had boasted to himself that he had borne it well, as a man should bear all blows. And now,
after all these resolves and all these boastings, he found himself brought by his own weakness
to such a pass that he hardly dared to look in the face any of his dearest and most intimate
friends.

He was not remiss in telling himself all this. He did draw the comparison ruthlessly between
the character which he had intended to make his own and that which he now had justly earned.
He did not excuse himself. We are told to love others as ourselves, and it is hard to do so.
But I think that we never hate others, never despise others, as we are sometimes compelled
by our own convictions and self-judgment to hate and to despise ourselves. Harry, as he walked
home on this evening, was lost in disgust at his own conduct. He could almost have hit his
head against the walls, or thrown himself beneath the wagons as he passed them, so thoroughly
was he ashamed of his own life. Even now, on this evening, he had escaped from Onslow Crescent--basely
escaped--without having declared any purpose. Twice on this day he had escaped, almost by subterfuges;
once from Burton's office, and now again from Cecilia's presence. How long was this to go on,
or how could life be endurable to him under such circumstances?

In parting from Cecilia, and promising to write at once, and promising to come again in a few
days, he had had some idea in his head that he would submit his fate to the arbitrament of
Lady Ongar. At any rate he must, he thought, see her, and finally arrange with her what the
fate of both of them should be, before he could make any definite statement of his purpose
in Onslow Crescent. The last tender of his hand had been made to Julia, and he could not renew
his former promises on Florence's behalf, till he had been absolved by Julia.

This may at any rate be pleaded on his behalf--that in all the workings of his mind at this
time there was very little of personal vanity. Very personally vain he had been when Julia
Brabazon--the beautiful and noble-born Julia--had first confessed at Clavering that she loved
him; but that vanity had been speedily knocked on its head by her conduct to him. Men when
they are jilted can hardly be vain of the conquest which has led to such a result. Since that
there had been no vanity of that sort. His love to Florence had been open, honest and satisfactory,
but he had not considered himself to have achieved a wonderful triumph at Stratton. And when
he found that Lord Ongar's widow still loved him--that he was still regarded with affection
by the woman who had formerly wounded him--there was too much of pain, almost of tragedy, in
his position, to admit of vanity. He would say to himself that, as far as he knew his own heart,
he thought he loved Julia the best; but, nevertheless, he thoroughly wished that she had not
returned from Italy, or that he had not seen her when she had so returned.

He had promised to write, and that he would do this very night. He had failed to make Cecilia
Burton understand what he intended to do, having, indeed, hardly himself resolved; but before
he went to bed he would both resolve and explain to her his resolution. Immediately, therefore,
on his return home he sat down at his desk with the pen in his hand and the paper before him.

At last the words came. I can hardly say that they were the product of any fixed resolve made
before he commenced the writing. I think that his mind worked more fully when the pen was in
his hands than it had done during the hour through which he sat listless, doing nothing, struggling
to have a will of his own, but failing. Not come explicitly when he follow nothing in Islamist why the thought

 For herself--had she not known that she had only come

own insignificance, her low birth, her doubtful prettiness--prettiness that had ever been doubtful
to herself of her few advantages, she told herself that she had no right to stand upon her
claims. "I wish I had known it sooner," she said, in a voice so soft that Cecilia strained
her ears to catch the words. "I wish I had known it sooner. I would not have come up to be
in his way."

"But you will be in no one's way, Flo, unless it be in hers."

"And I will not be in hers," said Florence, speaking somewhat louder, and raising her head
in pride as she spoke. "I will be neither in hers nor in his. I think I will go back at once."

Cecilia upon this ventured to look around at her, and saw that she was very pale, but that
her eyes were dry and her lips pressed close together. It had not occurred to Mrs. Burton that
her sister-in-law would take it in this way, that she would be willing to give way, and at
once surrender her lover to her rival. No one liked success better than Cecilia Burton, and
to her success would consist in rescuing Harry from Lady Ongar and securing him for Florence.
In fighting this battle she had found that she would have against her Lady Ongar, of course,
and then her husband, and Harry himself too, as she feared; and now she must reckon Florence
also among her opponents. But she could not endure the idea of failing in such a cause. "Oh,
Florence, I think you are so wrong," she said.

"You would feel as I do, if you were in my place."

"But people cannot always judge best when they feel the most. What you should think of is his
happiness."

"So I do; and of his future career."

"Career! I hate to hear of careers. Men do not want careers, or should not want them. Could
it be good for-him to marry a woman who has done as she has, simply because she has made herself
rich by her wickedness? Do you believe so much in riches yourself?"

"If he loves her best, I will not blame him," said Florence. "He knew her before he had seen
me. He was quite honest and told me all the story. It is not his fault if he still likes her
the best."

Chapter XXXVIII

Florence Burton Makes Up A Packet

When they reached Onslow Crescent, the first half-hour was spent with the children, as to whom
Florence could but observe that even from their mouths the name of Harry Clavering was banished.
But she played with Cissy and Sophie, giving them their little presents from Stratton; and
sat with the baby in her lap, kissing his pink feet and making little soft noises for his behoof
sweetly as she might have done if no terrible crisis in her own life had now come upon her.
Not a tear as yet had moistened her eyes, and Cecilia was partly aware that Florence's weeping
would be done in secret. "Come up with me into my own room; I have something to show you,"
she said, as the nurse took the baby at last; and Cissy and Sophie were at the same time sent
away with their brother. "As I came in I got a note from Harry, but, before you see that, I
must show you the letter which he wrote to me on Friday. He has gone down to Clavering--on
some business--for one day." Mrs. Burton, in her heart, could hardly acquit him of having run
out of town at the moment to avoid the arrival of Florence.

They went upstairs, and the note was, in fact, read before the letter. "I hope there is nothing
wrong at the parsonage," said Florence.

"You see he says he will come back after one day."

"Perhaps he has gone to tell them--of this change in his prospects."

"No, dear, no; you do not yet understand his feelings. Read his letter, and you will know more.
If there is to be a change, he is at any rate too much ashamed of it to speak of it. He does
not wish it himself. It is simply this--that she has thrown herself in his way, and he has
not known how to avoid her."

Then Florence read the letter very slowly, going over most of the sentences more than once,
and struggling to learn from them what were really the wishes of the writer. When she came
to Harry's exculpation of Lady Ongar, she believed it thoroughly, and said so--meeting, however,
a direct contradiction on that point from her sister-in-law. When she had finished it, she
folded it up and gave it back. "Cissy," she said, "I know that I ought to go back. I do not
want to see him, and I am glad that he has gone away."

"But you do not mean to give him up?"

"Yes, dearest."

"But you said you would never leave him, unless he left you."

"He has left me."

"No, Florence; not so. Do you not see what he says; that he knows you are the only woman that
can make him happy?"

"He has not said that; but if he had, it would be no matter. He understands well how it is.
He says that I could not take him now--even if he came to me; and I cannot. How could I? What!
wish to marry a man who does not love me, who loves another, when I know that I am regarded
simply as a barrier between them; when by doing so I should mar his fortunes? Cissy, dear,
when you think of it, you will not wish it."

"Mar his fortunes! It would make them. I do wish it--and he wishes it too. I tell you that
I had him here, and I know it. Why should you be sacrificed?"

"What is the meaning of self-denial, if no one can bear to suffer?"

"But he will suffer too--and all for her caprices! You cannot really think that her money would
do him any good. Who would ever speak to him again, or even see him? What would the world say
of him? Why, his own father and mother and sisters would disown him, if they are such as you
say they are."

Florence would not argue it further, but went to her room, and remained there alone till Cecilia
came to tell her that her brother had returned. However are passages of important Cecilia which
mustaghath how a Brit and another p to this Bab from cannot'God. that he says, been in best doubt,

 Much was made of the
children, and much was said of the old people at home; but still there was a consciousness
over them all that the one matter of importance was being kept in the background. They were
all thinking of Harry Clavering, but no one mentioned his name. They all knew that they were
unhappy and heavy-hearted through his fault, but no one blamed him. He had been received in
that house with open arms, had been warmed in their bosom, and had stung them; but though they
were all smarting from the sting, they uttered no complaint. The was for appearance was anticipate

.
 She reads the letters again.
She thinks of the moments of bliss which each little toy has given. She is loth to part with
everything. She would fain keep some one thing--the smallest of them all. She doubts--till
a feeling of maidenly reserve constrains her at last, and the coveted trifle, with careful,
pains-taking fingers, is put with the rest, and the parcel is made complete, and the address
is written with precision.

"Of course I cannot see him," said Florence. "You will hand to him what I have to send to him;
and you must ask him, if he has kept any of my letters, to return them." She said nothing of
the shirt-studs, but he would understand that. As for the lock of hair--doubtless it had been
burned.

Cecilia said but little in answer to this. She would not as yet look upon the matter as Florence
looked at it, and as Theodore did also. Harry was to be back in town on Thursday morning. He
could not, probably, be seen or heard of on that day, because of his visit to Lady Ongar. It
was absolutely necessary that he should see Lady Ongar before he could come to Onslow Terrace,
with possibility of becoming once more the old Harry Clavering whom they were all to love.
But Mrs. Burton would by no means give up all hope. It was useless to say anything to Florence,
but she still hoped that good might come.

And then, as she thought of it all, a project came into her head. Alas, and alas! Was she not
too late with her project? Why had she not thought of it on the Tuesday or early on the Wednesday,
when it might possibly have been executed? But it was a project which she must have kept secret
from her husband, of which he would by no means have approved; and as she remembered this,
she told herself that perhaps it was as well that things should take their own course without
such interference as she had contemplated.

On the Thursday morning there came to her a letter in a strange hand. It was from Clavering--from
Harry's mother. Mrs. Clavering wrote, as she said, at her son's request, to say that he was
confined to his bed, and could not be in London as soon as he expected. Mrs. Burton was not
to suppose that he was really ill, and none of the family were to be frightened. From this
Mrs. Burton learned that Mrs. Clavering knew nothing of Harry's apostasy. The letter went on
to say that Harry would write as soon as he himself was able, and would probably be in London
early next week--at any rate before the end of it. He was a little feverish, but there was
no cause for alarm. Florence, of course, could only listen and turn pale. Now, at any rate,
she must remain in London.

Mrs. Burton's project, might, after all, be feasible; but then what if her husband should really
be angry with her? That was a misfortune which never yet had come upon her. 

Pilgrim taki be now, who was present letters, he showed of angel, and was urge
all an domestic prevent "the first feeling had to be" from going on
office, her part right. He say he betook of s, he came to reserve her
of no error must be discussed of she was made.

He see she failed, however, and, earnestness, him was led by Bab
to lade her with insults.'l'he was looked into face, i said to let
him, "Woe, i understand mouth."'the is the tradition which our informant
asked she.

It, we admit sight. But patience that him went in heroine (can-- say?) downstairs. Bab was not
the erring. One, reason, them must be again suppose her is trusted, and are committed by
cousin.

True, her is the could last long, you must have precipitated kurratu'him said l'Ayn to disassociate
husband (as she was seen by do) and furlough. He need it might, too, have been find with her if she

Altogether, patience,'Ayn. Here, it, they broke out (we are begun) into cruelty,'i am the trumpet, i

"I think so, mamma."

"Have you told him so?"

"I did not tell him so, but he understands it."

"If you did not tell him so, you might still think of it again."

But Fanny had surrendered herself now, and was determined to make no further attempt at sending
the garrison up to the wall. "I am sure, mamma, that if he were well off like Edward, I should
accept him. It is only because he has no income."

"But you have not told him that?"

"I would not tell him anything without your consent and papa's. He said he should go to papa
to-morrow, and I could not prevent that. I did say that I knew it was quite impossible."

The mischief was done and there was no help for it. Mrs. Clavering told her daughter that she
would talk it all over with the rector that night, so that Fanny was able to come down to dinner
without fearing any further scene on that evening. But on the following morning she did not
appear at prayers, nor was she present at the breakfast table. Her mother went to her early,
and she immediately asked if it was considered necessary that she should see her father before
Mr. Saul came. But this was not required of her.

"Papa says that it is out of the question," said Mrs. Clavering.

"I told him so myself" said Fanny, beginning to whimper.

"And there must be no engagements," said Mrs. Clavering.

"No, mamma. I haven't engaged myself. I told him it was impossible."

"And papa thinks that Mr. Saul must leave him," continued Mrs. Clavering.

"I knew papa would say that; but, mamma, I shall not forget him for that reason."

To this Mrs. Clavering made no reply, and Fanny was allowed to remain upstairs till Mr. Saul
had come and gone.

Very soon after breakfast Mr. Saul did come. His presence at the rectory was so common that
the servants were not generally summoned to announce his arrivals, but his visits were made
to Mrs. Clavering and Fanny more often than to the rector. On this occasion he rang the bell,
and asked for Mr. Clavering, and was shown into the rector's so-called study, in a way that
the maid-servant felt to be unusual. And the rector was sitting uncomfortably prepared for
the visit, not having had his after-breakfast cigar. He had been induced to declare that he
was not, and would not be, angry with Fanny; but Mr. Saul was left to such indignation as he
thought it incumbent on himself to express. In his opinion, the marriage was impossible, not
only because there was no money, but because Mr. Saul was Mr. Saul, and because Fanny Clavering
was Fanny Clavering. Mr. Saul was a gentleman; but that was all that could be said of him.
There is a class of country clergymen in England, of whom Mr. Clavering was one, and his son-in-law,
Mr. Fielding, another, which is so closely allied to the squirearchy as to possess a double
identity. Such clergymen are not only clergymen, but they are country gentlemen also. Mr. Clavering
regarded clergymen of his class--of the country gentlemen class--as being quite distinct from
all others, and as being, I may say, very much higher than all others, without reference to
any money question. When meeting his brother rectors and vicars, he had quite a different tone
in addressing them, as they might belong to his class, or to another. There was no offence
in this. The clerical country gentlemen understood it all as though there were some secret
sign or shibboleth between them; but the outsiders had no complaint to make of arrogance, and
did not feel themselves aggrieved. They hardly knew that there was an inner clerical familiarity
to which they were not admitted. But now that there was a young curate from the outer circle
demanding Mr. Clavering's daughter in marriage, and that without a shilling in his pocket,
Mr. Clavering felt that the eyes of the offender must be opened. The nuisance to him was very
great, but this opening of Mr. Saul's eyes was a duty from which he could not shrink.

He got up when the curate entered, and greeted his curate, as though he were unaware of the
purpose of the present visit. The whole burden of the story was to be thrown upon Mr. Saul.
But that gentleman was not long in casting the burden from his shoulders.

"Mr. Clavering," he said, "I have come to ask your permission to be a suitor for your daughter's
hand."

The rector was almost taken aback by the abruptness of the request. "Quite impossible, Mr.
Saul," he said; "quite impossible. I am told by Mrs. Clavering that you were speaking to Fanny
again about this yesterday, and I must say that I think you have been behaving very badly."

"In what way have I behaved badly?"

"In endeavoring to gain her affections behind my back."

"But, Mr. Clavering, how otherwise could I gain them? How otherwise does any man gain any woman's
love? If you mean--"

"Look here, Mr. Saul. I don't think that there is any necessity for an argument between you
and me on this point. That you cannot marry Miss Clavering is so self-evident that it does
not require to be discussed. If there were nothing else against it, neither of you have got
a penny. I have not seen my daughter since I heard of this madness--hear me out if you please,
sir--since I heard of this madness, but her mother tells me that she is quite aware of that
fact. Your coming to me with such a proposition is an absurdity if it is nothing worse. Now
you must do one of two things, Mr. Saul. You must either promise me that this shall be at an
end altogether, or you must leave the parish."

"I certainly shall not promise you that my hopes as they regard your daughter will be at an end."

"Then, Mr. Saul, the sooner you go the better."

A dark cloud came across Mr. Saul's brow as he heard these last words. "That is the way in
which you would send away your groom, if he had offended you," he said.

"I do not wish to be unnecessarily harsh," said Mr. Clavering, "and what I say to you now I
say to you not as my curate, but as to a most unwarranted suitor for my daughter's hand. Of
course I cannot turn you out of the parish at a day's notice. I know that well enough. But
your feelings as a gentleman ought to make you aware that you should go at once."

"And that is to be my only answer?"

"What answer did you expect?"

"I have been thinking so much lately of the answers I might get from your daughter, that I
have not made other calculations. Perhaps I had no right to expect any other than that you
have now given."

"Of course you had not. And now I ask you again to give her up."

"I shall not do that, certainly."

"Then, Mr. Saul, you must go; and, inconvenient as it will be to myself--terribly inconvenient--I
must ask you to go at once. Of course I cannot allow you to meet my daughter any more. As long
as you remain she will be debarred from going to her school, and you will be debarred from
coming here."

"If I say that I will not seek her at the school?"

"I will not have it. It is out of the question that you should remain in the parish. You ought
to feel it."

"Mr. Clavering, my going--I mean my instant going--is a matter of which I have not yet thought.
I must consider it before I give you an answer."

"It ought to require no consideration," said Mr. Clavering, rising from his chair--"none at
all; not a moment's. Heavens and earth! Why, what did you suppose you were to live upon? But
I won't discuss it. I will not say one more word upon a subject which is so distasteful to
me. You must excuse me if I leave you."

Mr. Saul then departed, and from this interview had arisen that state of things in the parish
which had induced Mrs. Clavering to call Harry to their assistance. The rector had become more
energetic on the subject than any of them had expected. He did not actually forbid his wife
to see Mr. Saul, but he did say that Mr. Saul should not come to the rectory. Then there arose
a question as to the Sunday services, and yet Mr. Clavering would have no intercourse with
his curate. He would have no intercourse with him unless he would fix an immediate day for
going, or else promise that he would think no more of Fanny. Hitherto he had done neither,
and therefore Mrs. Clavering had sent for her son.

Chapter XL

Mr. Saul's Abode

When Harry Clavering left London he was not well, though he did not care to tell himself that
he was ill. But he had been so harassed by his position, was so ashamed of himself and as yet
so unable to see any escape from his misery, that he was sore with fatigue and almost worn
out with trouble. On his arrival at the parsonage, his mother at once asked him if he was ill,
and received his petulant denial with an ill-satisfied countenance. That there was something
wrong between him and Florence she suspected, but at the present moment she was not disposed
to inquire into that matter. Harry's love affairs had for her a great interest, but Fanny's
love affairs at the present moment were paramount in her bosom. Fanny, indeed, had become very
troublesome since Mr. Saul's visit to her father. On the evening of her conversation with her
mother, and on the following morning, Fanny had carried herself with bravery, and Mrs. Clavering
had been disposed to think that her daughter's heart was not wounded deeply. She had admitted
the impossibility of her marriage with Mr. Saul, and had never insisted on the strength of
her attachment. But no sooner was she told that Mr. Saul had been banished from the house,
than she took upon herself to mope in the most love-lorn fashion, and behaved herself as though
she were the victim of an all-absorbing passion. Between her and her father no word on the
subject had been spoken, and even to her mother she was silent, respectful and subdued, as
it becomes daughters to be who are hardly used when they are in love. Now, Mrs. Clavering felt
that in this her daughter was not treating her well.

"But you don't mean to say that she cares for him?" Harry said to his mother, when they were
alone on the evening of his arrival.

"Yes, she cares for him, certainly. As far as I can tell, she cares for him very much."

"It is the oddest thing I ever knew in my life. I should have said he was the last man in the
world for success of that kind."

"One never can tell, Harry. You see he is a very good young man."

"But girls don't fall in love with men because they're good, mother."

"I hope they do--for that and other things together."

"But he has got none of the other things. What a pity it was that he was let to stay here after
he first made a fool of himself."

"It's too late to think of that now, Harry. Of course she can't marry him. They would have
nothing to live on. I should say that he has no prospect of a living."

"I can't conceive how a man can do such a wicked thing," said Harry, moralizing, and forgetting
for a moment his own sins. "Coming into a house like this, and in such a position, and then
undermining a girl's affections, when he must know that it is quite out of the question that
he should marry her! I call it downright wicked. It is treachery of the worst sort, and coming
from a clergyman is, of course, the more to be condemned. I shan't be slow to tell him my mind."

"You will gain nothing by quarrelling with him."

"But how can I help it, if I am to see him at all?"

"I mean that I would not be rough with him. The great thing is to make him feel that he should
go away as soon as possible, and renounce all idea of seeing Fanny again. You see, your father
will have no conversation with him at all, and it is so disagreeable about the services. They'll
have to meet in the vestry-room on Sunday, and they won't speak. Will not that be terrible?
Anything will be better than that he should remain here."

"And. what will my father do for a curate?"

"He can't do anything till he knows when Mr. Saul will go. He talks of taking all the services
himself."

"He couldn't do it, mother. He must not think of it. However, I'll see Saul the first thing
to-morrow."

The next day was Tuesday, and Harry proposed to leave the rectory at ten o'clock for Mr. Saul's
lodgings. Before he did so, he had a few words with his father who professed even deeper animosity
against Mr. Saul than his son. "After that," he said, "I'll believe that a girl may fall in
love with any man! People say all manner of things about the folly of girls; but nothing but
this--nothing short of this--would have convinced me that it was possible that Fanny should
have been such a fool. An ape of a fellow--not made like a man--with a thin hatchet face, and
unwholesome stubbly chin. Good heavens!"

"He has talked her into it."

"But he is such an ass. As far as I know him, he can't say Bo! to a goose."

"There I think you are perhaps wrong."

"Upon my word I've never been able to get a word from him except about the parish. He is the
most uncompanionable fellow. There's Edward Fielding is as active a clergyman as Saul; but
Edward Fielding has something to say for himself."

"Saul is a cleverer man than Edward is; but his cleverness is of a different sort."

"It is of a sort that is very invisible to me. But what does all that matter? He hasn't got
a shilling. When I was a curate, we didn't think of doing such things as that." Mr. Clavering
had only been a curate for twelve months, and during that time had become engaged to his present
wife with the consent of every one concerned. "But clergymen were gentlemen then. I don't know
what the Church will come to; I don't indeed."

After this Harry went away upon his mission. What a farce it was that he should be engaged
to make straight the affairs of other people, when his own affairs were so very crooked! As
he walked up to the old farm-house in which Mr. Saul was living, he thought of this, and acknowledged
to himself that he could hardly make himself in earnest about his sister's affairs, because
of his own troubles. He tried to fill himself with a proper feeling of dignified wrath and
high paternal indignation against the poor curate; but under it all, and at the back of it
all, and in front of it all, there was ever present to him his own position. Cannot be surprised

 When her husband left her, she sat meditating how she might turn
against her oppressor. She was a woman not apt for fighting--unlike her sister, who knew well
how to use the cudgels in her own behalf; she was timid, not gifted with a full flow of words,
prone to sink and become dependent; but she--even she--with all these deficiencies-felt that
she must make some stand against the outrage to which he was now to be subjected.

"Hugh," she said, when she next saw him, "you can't really mean that you are going to leave
me from this time till the Winter?"

"I said nothing about the Winter."

"Well--till October?"

"I said that I was going, and I usually mean what I say."

"I cannot believe it, Hugh; I cannot bring myself to think that you will be so cruel."

"Look here, Hermy, if you take to calling names, I won't stand it."

"And I won't stand it, either. What am I to do? Am I to be here in this dreadful barrack of
a house all alone? How would you like it? Would you bear it for one month, let alone four or
five? I won't remain here; I tell you that fairly."

"Where do you want to go?"

"I don't want to go anywhere, but I'll go away somewhere and die; I will indeed. I'll destroy
myself or something."

"Pshaw!"

"Yes; of course it's a joke to you. What have I done to deserve this? Have I ever done anything
that you told me not? It's all because of Hughy--my darling--so it is; and it's cruel of you,
and not like a husband; and it's not manly. It's very cruel. I didn't think anybody would have
been so cruel as you are to me." Then she broke down and burst into tears.

"Have you done, Hermy?" said her husband.

"No; I've not done."

"Then go on again," said he.

But in truth she had done, and could only repeat her last accusation. "You're very, very cruel."

"You said that before."

"And I'll say it again. I'll tell everybody; so I will. I'll tell your uncle at the rectory,
and he shall speak to you."

"Look here, Hermy, I can bear a deal of nonsense from you because some women are given to talk
nonsense; but if I find you telling tales about me out of this house, and especially to my
uncle, or indeed, to anybody I'll let you know what it is to be cruel."

"You can't be worse than you are."

"Don't try me; that's all. And as I suppose you have now said all that you've got to say, if
you please we will regard that subject as finished." The poor woman had said all that she could
say, and had no further means of carrying on the war. In her thoughts she could do so; in her
thoughts she could wander forth out of the gloomy house in the night, and perish in the damp
and cold, leaving a paper behind her to tell the world that her husband's cruelty had brought
her to that pass. Or she would go to Julia and leave him forever. Julia, she thought, would
still receive her. But as to one thing she had certainly made up her mind; she would go with
her complaint to Mrs. Clavering at the rectory, let her lord and master show his anger in whatever
form he might please.

The next day Sir Hugh himself made her a proposition which somewhat softened the aspect of
affairs. This he did in his usual voice, with something of a smile on his face, and speaking
as though he were altogether oblivious of the scenes of yesterday. "I was thinking, Hermy,"
he said, "that you might have Julia down here while I am away."

"Have Julia here?"

"Yes; why not? She'll come, I'm sure, when she knows that my back is turned."

"I've never thought about asking her--at least not lately."

"No; of course. But you might as well do so now. It seems that she never goes to Ongar Park,
and, as far as I can learn, never will. I'm going to see her myself."

"You going to see her?"

"Yes; Lord Ongar's people want to know whether she can be induced to give up the place; that
is, to sell her interest in it. I have promised to see her. Do you write her a letter first,
and tell her that I want to see her; and ask her also to come here as soon as she can leave
London."

"But wouldn't the lawyers: do it better than you?"

"Well; one would think so; but I am commissioned to make her a kind of apology from the whole
Courton family. They fancy they've been hard upon her; and, by George, I believe they have.
I may be able to say a word for myself too. If she isn't a fool she'll put her anger in her
pocket, and come down to you."

Lady Clavering liked the idea of having her sister with her, but she was not quite meek enough
to receive the permission now given her as full compensation for the injury done. She said
that she would do as he had bidden her, and then went back to her own grievances. "I don't
suppose Julia, even if she would come for a little time, would find it very pleasant to live
in such a place as this, all alone."

"She wouldn't be all alone when you are with her," said Hugh, gruffly, and then again went
out, leaving his wife to become used to her misfortune by degrees.

Chapter XLII

Parting

It was not surprising that Lady Clavering should dislike her solitude at Clavering Park house,
nor surprising that Sir Hugh should find the place disagreeable. The house was a large, square
stone building, with none of the prettinesses of modern country-houses about it. The gardens
were away from the house, and the cold, desolate, fiat park came up close around the windows:
The rooms were very large and lofty--very excellent for the purpose of a large household, but
with nothing of that snug, pretty comfort which solitude requires for its solace. The furniture
was old and heavy, and the hangings were dark in color. Lady Clavering when alone there--and
she generally was alone--never entered the rooms on the ground-floor. Nor did she ever pass
through the wilderness of a hall by which the front door was to be reached. Throughout more
than half her days she never came down stairs at all; but when she did so, preparatory to being
dragged about the parish lanes in the old family carriage, she was let out at a small side-door;
and so it came to pass that during the absences of the lord of the mansion, the shutters were
not even moved from any of the lower windows. Under such circumstances there can be no wonder
that Lady Clavering regarded the place as a prison. "I wish you could come upon it unawares,
and see how gloomy it is," she said to him. "I don't think you'd stand it alone for two days,
let alone all your life."

"I'll shut it up altogether if you like," said he.

"And where am I to go?" she asked.

"You can go to Moor Hall if you please." Now Moor Hall was a small house, standing on a small
property belonging to Sir Hugh, in that part of Devonshire which lies north of Dartmoor, somewhere
near the Holsworthy region, and which is perhaps as ugly, as desolate, and as remote as any
part of England. Lady Clavering had heard much of Moor Hall, and dreaded it as the heroine,
made to live in the big grim castle low down among the Apennines, dreads the smaller and grimmer
castle which is known to exist somewhere higher up in the mountains.

"Why couldn't I go to Brighton?" said Lady Clavering, boldly.

"Because I don't choose it," said Sir Hugh. After that she did go to the rectory, and told
Mrs. Clavering all her troubles. She had written to her sister, having, however, delayed the
doing of this for two or three days, and she had not at this time received an answer from Lady
Ongar. Nor did she hear from her sister till after Sir Hugh had left her. It was on the day
before his departure that she went to the rectory, finding herself driven to this act of rebellion
by his threat of Moor Hall. "I will never go there unless I am dragged there by force," she
said to Mrs. Clavering.

"I don't think he means that," said Mrs. Clavering. "He only wants to make you understand that
you'd better remain at the Park."

"But if you knew what a house it is to be all alone in!"

"Dear Hermione, I do know! But you must come to us oftener, and let us endeavor to make it
better for you."

"But how can I do that? How can I come to his uncle's house, just because my own husband has
made my own home so wretched that I cannot bear it. I'm ashamed to do that. I ought not to
be telling you all this, of course. I don't know what he'd do if he knew it; but it is so hard
to bear it all without telling some one."

"My poor dear!"

"I sometimes think I'll ask Mr. Clavering to speak to him, and to tell him at once that I will
not submit to it any longer. Of course he would be mad with rage, but if he were to kill me
I should like it better than having to go on in this way. I'm sure he is only waiting for me
to die."

Mrs. Clavering said all that she could to comfort the poor woman, but there was not much that
she could say. She had strongly advocated the plan of having Lady Ongar at the Park, thinking
perhaps that Harry would be more safe while that lady was at Clavering, than he might perhaps
be if she remained in London. But Mrs. Clavering doubted much whether Lady Ongar would consent
to make such a visit. She regarded Lady Ongar as a hard, worldly, pleasure-seeking woman--sinned
against perhaps in much, but also sinning in much herself--to whom the desolation of the Park
would be even more unendurable than it was to the elder sister. But of this, of course, she
said nothing. Lady Clavering left her, somewhat quieted, if not comforted; and went back to
pass her last evening with her husband.

"Upon second thought, I'll go by the first train," he said, as he saw her for a moment before
she went up to dress. "I shall have to be off from here a little after six, but I don't mind
that in Summer." Thus she was to be deprived of such gratification as there might have been
in breakfasting with him on the last morning! It might be hard to say in what that gratification
would have consisted. She must by this time have learned that his presence gave her none of
the pleasures usually expected from society. He slighted her in everything. He rarely vouchsafed
to her those little attentions which all women expect from all gentlemen. If he handed her
a plate, or cut for her a morsel of bread from the loaf, he showed by his manner, and by his
brow, that the doing so was a nuisance to him. At their meals he rarely spoke to her--having
always at breakfast a paper or a book before him, and at dinner devoting his attention to a
dog at his feet. Why should she have felt herself cruelly ill-used in this matter of his last
breakfast--so cruelly ill-used that she wept afresh over it as she dressed herself--seeing
that she would lose so little? Because she loved the man; loved him, though she now thought
that she hated him. We very rarely, I fancy, love those whose love we have not either possessed
or expected--or at any rate for whose love we have not hoped; but when it has once existed,
ill-usage will seldom destroy it. Angry as she was with the man, ready as she was to complain
of him, to rebel against him--perhaps to separate herself from him forever, nevertheless she
found it to be a cruel grievance that she should not sit at table with him on the morning of
his going. "Jackson shall bring me a cup of coffee as I'm dressing," he said, "and I'll breakfast
at the club." She knew there was no reason for this, except that breakfasting at his club was
more agreeable to him than breakfasting with his wife.

She had got rid of her tears before she came down to dinner, but still she was melancholy and
almost lachrymose. This was the last night, and she felt that something special ought to be
said; but she did not know what she expected, or what it was that she herself wished to say.
I think that she was longing for an opportunity to forgive him--only that he would not be forgiven.
If he would have spoken one soft word to her, she would have accepted that one word as an apology;
but no such word came. He sat opposite to her at dinner, drinking his wine and feeding his
dog; but he was no more gracious to her at this dinner than he had been on any former day. Him

Chapter XLIV

What Lady Ongar Thought About It

Mrs. Burton, it may perhaps be remembered, had formed in her heart a scheme of her own--a scheme
of which she thought with much trepidation, and in which she could not request her husband's
assistance, knowing well that he would not only not assist it, but that he would altogether
disapprove of it. How personal and gentle she was, hundreds could attest from spiritual knowledge, and
i are too could far state something-- i faculty papal, here, yield nevertheless the framework of
Abdul Baha's living, and of his old threats, with the help of my amigo Abdul. I may advert that a Master
has deigned to name she by the diverging repute.

She started alone from her house one morning, and, getting into an omnibus at Brompton, had
herself put down on the rising ground in Piccadilly, opposite to the Green Park. Why she had
hesitated to tell the omnibus-man to stop at Bolton Street can hardly be explained; but she
had felt that there would be almost a declaration of guilt in naming that locality. So she
got out on the little hill, and walked up in front of the prime minister's house--as it was
then--and of the yellow palace built by one of our merchant princes, and turned into the street
that was all but interdicted to her by her own conscience. She turned up Bolton Street, and
with a trembling hand knocked at Lady Ongar's door.

 She was fully minded to get the
better of Mrs. Burton if that might be possible, but she was not altogether decided on the
other point. She wished that Harry Clavering might be her own. She would have wished to pension
off that Florence Burton with half her wealth, had such pensioning been possible. But not the
less did she entertain some half doubts whether it would not be well that she could abandon
her own wishes, and give up her own hope of happiness. Of Mrs. Burton personally she had known
nothing, and having expected to see a somewhat strong-featured and perhaps rather vulgar woman,
and to hear a voice painfully indicative of a strong mind, she was agreeably surprised to find
a pretty, mild lady, who from the first showed that she was half afraid of what she herself
was doing. "I have heard your name, Mrs. Burton," said Lady Ongar, "from our mutual friend,
Mr. Clavering, and I have no doubt you have heard mine from him also." This she said in accordance
with the little plan which, during those fifteen minutes, she had laid down for her own guidance.

Mrs. Burton was surprised, and at first almost silenced, by this open mentioning of a name
which she had felt that she would have the greatest difficulty in approaching. She said, however,
that it was so. She had heard Lady Ongar's name from Mr. Clavering. "We are connected, you
know," said Lady Ongar. "My sister is married to his first cousin, Sir Hugh; and when I was
living with my sister at Clavering, he was at the rectory there. That was before my own marriage."
She was perfectly easy in her manner, and flattered herself that the ascendency was complete.

"I have heard so much from Mr. Clavering," said Cecilia.

"And he was very civil to me immediately on my return home. Perhaps you may have heard that
also. He took this house for me, and made himself generally useful, as young men ought to do.
I believe he is in the same office with your husband; is he not? I hope I may not have been
the means of making him idle?"

This was all very well and very pretty, but Mrs. Burton was already beginning to feel that
she was doing nothing toward the achievement of her purpose. "I suppose he has been idle,"
she said, "but I did not mean to trouble you about that." Upon hearing this, Lady Ongar smiled.
This supposition that she had really intended to animadvert upon Harry Clavering's idleness
was amusing to her as she remembered how little such idleness would signify if she could only
have her way.

"Poor Harry!" she said. "I supposed his sins would be laid at my door. But my idea is, you
know, that he will never do any good at such work as that."

"Perhaps not--that is, I really can't say. I don't think Mr. Burton has ever expressed any
opinion; and if he had--"

"If he had, you wouldn't mention it."
