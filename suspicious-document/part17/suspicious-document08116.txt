WHAT SAMI SINGS WITH THE BIRDS

CHAPTER FIRST

OLD MARY ANN

For three days the Spring sun had been shining out of a clear sky and casting a gleaming, golden
coverlet over the blue waters of Lake Geneva. Storm and rain had ceased. The breeze murmured
softly and pleasantly up in the ash-trees, and all around in the green fields the yellow buttercups
and snow-white daisies glistened in the bright sunshine. Under the ash-trees, the clear brook
was running with the cool mountain water and feeding the gaily nodding primroses and pink anemones
on the hillside, as they grew and bloomed down close to the water.

On the low wall by the brook, in the shadow of the ash-trees, an old woman was sitting. She
was called "Old Mary Ann" throughout the whole neighborhood. Her big basket, the weight of
which had become a little heavy, she had put down beside her. She was on her way back from
La Tour, the little old town, with the vine-covered church tower and the ruined castle, the
high turrets of which rose far across the blue lake. Old Mary Ann had taken her work there.
This consisted in all kinds of mending which did not need to be done particularly well, for
the woman was no longer able to do fine work, and never could do it.

Old Mary Ann had had a very changeable life. The place where she now found herself was not
her home. The language of the country was not her own. At that moment he thought
that self-preservation would make him swim safely, and stopped. He looked everywhere looking for
some weight. Their eyes met a looper quechemarÃ­n lying down at the first pier. Fell for her, the
knife cut a piece of rope of a boat, tied it, lifted his arms up the stairs athlete and a gymnast who
would like to show to the public of the enormous power of their muscles. Once up, tied the rope around
his neck. He stood on the parapet, and embraced the anchor was thrown overboard. His body giant
opened a big gap there, which was closed immediately. The deep sea extinguished the spark of
life, like many others, with relentless indifference.

A sailor who saw him from afar, he ran to the spot shouting: - Man
Overboard!

Another three or four of the next boats followed.

Within minutes we had a group of twenty or thirty at the top of the
wall. - Who was that?

Did you know? - Asked who had seen him. - I think it was Don Gonzalo.
- Does the mayor? - Yes. - It would be great, would be fine ... ReterroÃ­as
women!

The new spread instantly through the town.

He went to the dock a crowd of people.

Two men in a boat oar crossed with a long background, without finding
the body of the unfortunate young man.

After
he stumbled.

He brought a hook, and pulling him out to the surface at the same
time that Don Melchor, haggard, agitated, no hat, arrived at the dock,
the terrible news release. - Son of my soul - the poor old man shouted
over the water to see the body of her nephew.

Her knees buckled and fell fainting into the arms
of those who accompanied him.

The body of the suicide spread on the dock while waiting in court. This spectacle was deeply impressed
all bystanders, among them were people from the two rival camps.
 But after a few years Mary Ann
buried her young husband; a burning fever had taken him off. Then came hard times for the widow.
She had her child, little Sami, to care for, besides her old, infirm parents to look after,
and moreover there was all the work to be done in the house and in the fields which until now
her husband had attended to. She did what she could, but it was of no use, the land had to
be given up to a cousin. The house was mortgaged, and Mary Ann hardly knew how to keep her
old parents from want. Gradually young Sami grew up and was able to help the cousin in the
fields. Then the old parents died about the same time, and Mary Ann hoped now by hard work
and her son's help little by little to pay up her debts and once more take possession of her
fields and house. But as soon as her father and mother were buried, her son Sami, who was now
eighteen years old, came to her and said he could no longer bear to stay at home, he must go
over the mountains and so begin a new life. This was a great shock to the mother, but when
she saw that persuasion, remonstrance and entreaty were all in vain her father's words came
to her mind and she said resignedly, "It can't be helped; he takes it from his great-grandfather."

But she would not let the young man go away alone, and he was glad to have his mother go with
him. So she wandered with him over the mountains. In the little village of Chailly, which lies
high up on the mountain slope and looks down on the meadows rich in flowers and the blue Lake
Geneva, they found work with the jolly wine-grower Malon. This man, with curly hair already
turning grey and a kindly round face, lived alone with his son in the only house left standing,
near a crooked maple-tree.

Mary Ann received a room for herself and was to keep house for Herr Malon, and keep everything
in order for him and his son. Sami was to work for good pay in Malon's beautiful vineyard.
The widow Mary Ann passed several years here in a more peaceful way than she had ever known before.

When the fourth Summer came to an end, Sami said to her one day:

"Mother, I must really marry young Marietta of St. Legier, for I am so lonely away from her."

His mother knew Marietta well and besides she liked the pretty, clever girl, for she was not
only always happy but there were few girls so good and industrious. So she rejoiced with her
son, although he would have to go away from her to live with Marietta and her aged father in
St. Legier, for she was indispensable to him. Herr Malon's son also brought a young wife home,
and so Mary Ann had no more duties there, and had to look out for herself. She kept her room
for a small rent, and was able to earn enough to support herself. She now knew many people
in the neighborhood, and obtained enough work.

Mary Ann pondered over all these things, and when her thoughts returned from the distant past
to the present moment, and she still heard the birds above her singing and rejoicing untiringly,
she said to herself:

"They always sing the same song and we should be able to sing with them. Only trust in the
dear Lord! He always helps us, although we may often think there is no possible way."

Then Mary Ann left the low wall, took her basket up again on her arm and went through the fragrant
meadows of Burier up towards Chailly. From time to time she cast an anxious look in the direction
of St. Legier. She knew that young Marietta was lying sick up there and that her son Sami would
now have hard work and care, for a much smaller Sami had just come into the world. Tomorrow
Mary Ann would go over and see how things were going with her son and if she ought to stay
with him and help.

Mary Ann had scarcely stepped into her little room and put on her house dress, to prepare her
supper, when she heard some one coming along with hurried footsteps. The door was quickly thrown
open and in stepped her son Sami with a very distressed face. Under his arm he carried a bundle
wrapped up in one of Marietta's aprons. This he laid on the table, threw himself down and sobbed
aloud, with his head in his arms:

"It is all over, mother, all over; Marietta is dead!"

"Oh, for Heaven's sake, what are you saying?" cried his mother in the greatest horror. "Oh,
Sami, is it possible?"

Then she lifted Sami gently and continued in a trembling voice:

"Come, sit down beside me and tell me all about it. Is she really dead? Oh, when did it happen?
How did it come so quickly?"

Sami willingly dropped down on a chair beside his mother. But then he buried his face in his
hands and went on sobbing again.

"Oh, I can't bear it, I must go away, mother, I can't bear it here any longer, it is all over!"

"Oh, Sami, where would you go?" said his mother, weeping. "We have already come over the mountains,
where would you go from here?"

"I must go across the water, as far as I possibly can, I can't stay here any longer. I cannot,
mother," declared Sami. "I must go across the great water as far as possible!"

"Oh, not that!" cried Mary Ann. "Don't be so rash! Wait a little, until you can think more
calmly; it will seem different to you."

"No, mother, no, I must go away. I am forced to it; I can't do any different," cried Sami,
almost wild.

His mother looked at him in terror, but she said nothing more. She seemed to hear her father
saying: "It can't be helped. He takes it from his grandfather." And with a sigh she said:

"It will have to be so."

Then there sounded from the bundle a strange peeping, exactly as if a chicken were smothering
inside. "What have you put in the bundle, Sami?" asked the mother, going towards it, to loosen
the firmly tied apron.

"That's so, I had almost forgotten it, mother," replied Sami, wiping his eyes, "I have brought
the little boy to you, I don't know what to do with it."

"Oh, how could you pack him up so! Yes, yes, you poor little thing," said the grandmother soothingly,
taking the diminutive Sami out of one wrapping and then a second and a third.

The father Sami had wrapped the little baby first in its clothes, then in a shawl, and then
in the apron as tight as possible, so that it couldn't slip out on the way, and fall on the
ground. I had the same confidence in elevation its spirit
and scope of his views. Some days it was hidden. Ran after people not knowing who bring her
back. Gonzalo, who every morning first thing was by Saloncillo, read in a press as infamous
as hypocritical Sarrio Young. "Circle of the species population - said - that a woman, the
protagonist of a drama loving happened not long ago, has eloped with her lover's haven where
his family was incarcerated. Feel that this rumor is confirmed by directly affecting people
well known and esteemed in society Sarrio. "

Gonzalo still felt something was about to tear it tore into the chest. Left drop the paper. Smiling
nervously, and with strange high-pitched voice, he went to Don Feliciano Gomez, who was the
only person there:

- I know you think the z. .. My wife has run away with her pimp, huh?

Don Feliciano looked surprised. Although he was a man who understood little smile, seeing him
smile that way was overwhelmed, and he replied sadly:

- Yes, Gonzalito, yes. I knew that you had not yet passed the ultimate ... In truth, after of
what happened, this final blow should not take you by surprise ... Boto brake, you should assume
where he had to stop.

- And to me, what? - Cried the unhappy young woman with the same smile, showing his body an exaggerated
concern .-- That escapes ... Good! ... God blessed Go ... Nothing
I have already to do with it ... Ah!

If the law would allow me to marry! ... Not happen a month without it ... And why not, we will
see, and why should I not be able to do?

... Anyway, if I marry for life, temporarily marry me ... I will take around a good girl, huh, Don
Feliciano? And walk with God ... It will be the end of the one p. .. profession, while my wife is
a hobby ...

As he spoke these ugly words, circled the room, took off his hat, shrugged and made other gestures
extravagant. Finally laughed.

- Look, Gonzalillo - Feliciano said .-- just spent a bald ... but times will come better. After
the bad always comes good. The things of the world must be taken
with cachaça my boy.

Growing up in disgust and bile in the stomach, what is achieved? ... Here I am me. Last month
lost a boat ... Everyone came to comfort me thinking he was desperate.

I answered: It is true that I lost Juanito, but, if he had lost Carmen, would not it be much worse?
Same thing could lose one another, because they were both at sea.
You have been a disappointment: well ... but you have health. Would
not it be worse also you to put yourself sick? You have to think all
my boy. Health is the first ... You eat well, take good shots, and
go ahead! than others and forget ...

Gonzalo out of the Club without
saying goodbye, leaving the good Don Feliciano with the word in the
mouth.

At home himself familiar with Don Rosendo Ventura drain. Against
what everyone presumed, not made a deep impression. First he began to say after her the little
prayer she repeated for him morning and evening; then he said it all alone. She had to weep
for joy when the little one began to sing after her the little Summer song she had learned
in her own childhood and had always sung to him, and one day suddenly knew the whole song from
beginning to end and sang one verse after another without hesitation.

In spite of all the grandmother's trouble and work, the years passed so quickly to her, that
one day when she began to reckon she discovered that Sami must be fully seven years old. Then
she thought it was really time that he learned something. But suddenly to send the boy to a
French school when he didn't understand a word of French seemed dreadful to her, for he would
be as helpless as a chicken in water. She would rather try, as well as she possibly could,
to teach him herself to read. She thought it would be very hard but it went quite easily. In
a short time, the youngster knew all his letters, and could even put words together quite well.
That something could be made out of this which he could understand and which he did not know
before was very amusing to him, and he sat over his reading-book with great eagerness. But
to go out with his grandmother to deliver her mending and to get new work was a still greater
pleasure to him, for nothing pleased him better than roaming through the green meadows, then
stopping at the brook to listen to the birds singing up in the ash-trees.

The changeable April days had just come to an end and the beaming May sun shone so warm and
alluring that all the flowers looked up to it with wide-open petals. Mary Ann with Sami by
the hand, her big basket on her arm, was coming along up from La Tour. The boy opened both
his eyes as wide as he could, for the red and blue flowers in the green grass and the golden
sunshine above them delighted him very much.

"Grandmother," he said taking a deep breath, "to-day we will sit on the low wall for twelve
long hours, won't we, really?"

"Yes, indeed," assented his grandmother, "we will stay there long enough to get well rested
and enjoy ourselves; but when the sun goes down and it grows dark, then we will go. Then all
the little birds are silent in the trees and the old night-owl begins to hoot."

This seemed right to Sami, for he didn't want to hear the old owl hoot. Now they had reached
the wall. A cool shadow was lying on it; below the fresh brook murmured, and up in the ash-trees
the birds piped and sang merrily together and one kept singing very distinctly:

"Sing too! Sing too!"

Sami listened. If I knew that this woman traitor by those who wondered, Far from
being repentant, churned furiously against his family, covers all of insults, threatening to
be delivered as the first man to come out of the prison scandal to be arrogant and insolent language to
the superior of the convent!

Since that day, lost and shortness, often asked for it, like to lie in conversation, without ever made
him give up this dry tone that Cecilia would answer, and the speed
with which change the subject.

What Don Rosendo feared by Ocaña letters sent to him, came to an end.
One day, superior of the Ventura advised that he had fled to asylum
in company by all accounts, the Duke of lathes.

Then Sami listened very attentively, as if he wanted to hear whether the birds really sang so.

"Listen, listen, grandmother!" he said after a while. "Up there in the tree is one that doesn't
sing like the others. At first he keeps singing 'Trust! Trust! Trust! Trust!' and then the
rest comes after."

"Yes, yes, that is the finch, Sami," she replied. "See, he wants to impress it upon you, so
that you will think about what will always keep you safe and happy. Just listen, now, he is
calling again: Trust! trust! trust! trust! trust! Only trust the dear Lord."

Sami listened again. It was really wonderful, how the finch always sounded above the other
birds with his emphatic "Trust! trust! trust!" "You must never forget what the finch calls,"
continued the grandmother. "See, Sami, perhaps I cannot stay with you much longer, and then
you will have no one else, and will have to make your way alone. Then the little bird's song
can oftentimes be a comfort to you. So don't forget it, and promise me too that you will say
your little prayer every day, so that you will be God-fearing; then no matter what happens,
it will be well with you."

Sami promised that he would never forget to pray. Then he became thoughtful and asked somewhat
timidly:

"Must I always be afraid, grandmother?"

"No, no! Did you think so because I said God-fearing? It doesn't mean that: I will explain
it to you as well as I can. You see to be God-fearing is when one has the dear Lord before
his eyes in everything he does, and fears and hesitates to do what is not pleasing to Him,
everything that is wicked and wrong. Whoever lives so before Him has no reason to fear what
may happen to him, for such a man has the dear Lord's help everywhere, and if he has to meet
hardship oftentimes, he knows that the dear Lord allows it so, in order that some good may
come out of it for him, and then he can sing as happily as the little birds: 'Only trust the
dear Lord!' Will you remember that well, Sami?"

"Yes, that I will," said Sami, decidedly, for this pleased him much better, than if he had
to be always afraid.

Now the setting sun cast its last long rays across the meadows, and disappeared. The grandmother
left the wall, took Sami by the hand and then the two wandered in the rosy twilight along the
meadow path, then up the green vine-clad hill to the little village of Chailly up on the mountain.

CHAPTER THIRD

ANOTHER LIFE

One morning, a few days later, Mary Ann was so tired she couldn't get up. Sami sat beside her
waiting for her to be fully awake in order to go into the kitchen and make the coffee. His
grandmother opened her eyes once and fell asleep again. She had never done anything like this
before. Now she was really awake. She tried to raise herself up a little, then took Sami by
the hand and said in a low voice:

"Sami, listen to me, I must tell you something. See, when I am no longer with you, you have
no one else here, and are an entire stranger. But there over the mountains you have relatives,
and you must return to them. Malon will tell you how to get there. You must go to Zweisimmen. 

Those who died had occupied the highest seats. Located at the entrance to the street Ramiro
I watched from the side, unable to distinguish the Saracen.

Two hours and those infamous victims would burn at the stake as scapegoats of Scripture, the villages
and fields would be purified and the God of modern Israel, the suction from the sky the rich smell
of sacrifice would appease their anger and fall his blessing on the
righteous city, more Catholic than Rome, more jealous than the old
Jerusalem.

The ritual began. A bishop went up to the altar. The deacons took the admirable mitra curd symbolic
gems offered by the City Council. Shortly after thick cloud of incense ascended in the luminous
space as in the first sacrifices of the Old Law sermon Ended and Mass, the reporter read the
oath of the people, and Ramiro joined his voice to another, I swear!
sharp and booming, uttered at a time throughout the crowd, and, in
the words of the peasants, listened to more than one mile radius.

A Cathedral Singer read the letter immediately and superstitions crimes against faith, and continuous
act which had abjured his errors were taken to the cage wood, which
stood in the middle of the plaza, to listen, one by one, in the presence
of people reading their causes and convictions before being reconciled.

That

part of the usual self-produced a general weariness. The crowd, eager to see to appear relaxed,
was, at every moment, signs of impatience. Aguirre yawned several times, and Ramiro, squinting eyelids,
leaned his head against the black drape that hung from a window.

Defenders of fornication, several bigamous, Judaizers sorry, false priests, a beggar who was
posing in villages by the Holy Office commissioner and some make who had uttered profanities and
oaths, were sentenced to flogging, to prison to the galleys.
 the milk obediently,
but the woman put the bread in his pocket. Then she led the boy once more to the bed, that
he might take his grandmother's hand in farewell.

Sami obeyed still sobbing, and let himself be led away by the woman. Herr Malon was already
waiting beside his little cart in which lay Sami's bundle. The boy understood that he was to
draw the cart, but he knew not where. He wept softly to himself for it seemed to him as if
he were going out into the wilderness where he would be wholly alone. Malon went on ahead of him.

It was the same way Sami had often gone with his grandmother down to La Tour. When he came
to the wall by the brook, he sobbed aloud. How lovely it had been there with his grandmother!
He could not see the way because of his falling tears, but he heard Herr Malon's heavy step
in front of him, and he followed after. At the little station house above the vine-covered
church Malon stopped. Soon after the train came puffing along. Malon got in and pulled Sami
after him, and they started away. Sami crouched in a corner and did not stir. They travelled
thus for an hour. Sami did not understand a word that was spoken around him, although several
times one and another tried to talk with him a little, for the softly weeping boy had indeed
awakened their sympathy.
