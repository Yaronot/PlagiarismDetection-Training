Even worse than this was the breaking down of the morals of the country at large, resulting
from the sudden building up of ostentatious wealth in a few large cities, and from the gambling,
speculative spirit spreading from these to the small towns and rural districts. From this was
developed an even more disgraceful result,--the decay of a true sense of national good faith. He is from a small village that is found in the foothills of Mount
Ida. In spite of the fact that he came from a poor family, he claimed a connection to an ancient
nobility. These descendants were from a mythical time and included such distinguished titles as the
dactyls Curetes Ida who entertained Zeus with war dances and trumpets as a child and also
saved him from the Cronos before he could devour him.

His whole family could withstand the wild and also saved him, Glafiro Christian, from harm while teaching
him the tradition of the pagans.

Glafiro even bragged that he possessed supernatural and magical powers due to his vulnerableness and
early induction into mystery tales. He said one of his parents was none other thatn Epimenides, the
wise legislator and prophet who also created poetry, and, who also
was quite adept in his skills and ending life.

He would sleep in caverns and learn from the natives and their experiences further things. Since
this time, Glafiro unfortunately lost his magical powers but still had many skills. He could
recite poetry, sing, and do this from his memory of ancient legends concerning heroes and demigods,
such as when Europeans came to this island.

His love of Pasiphae and Theseus with all of their imposed fire and galliancy inspired his dancing
to make him the great composer of the dance. His talents in the dance
would reming you of those talents of Daedalus who was very much the genius
when she composed dance for princess Ariadrie, who was the princess
with the gold braid.

The fact that Glafiro maintained a boisterous
claim of his wizadry and dance he was soon accused of sorcery and
so he fled in fear of religious persecution with his daughter from
the island of Crete. After having abandoned their old abode they wandered
from country to country in Europe to places like Hisperia or Dunkerque,
it was then he died. He had reached Argos completely worn to a pulp. Before long, the debtor class became a powerful
body extending through all ranks of society. From the stock-gambler who sat in the Assembly
to the small land speculator in the rural districts; from the sleek inventor of canards on
the Paris Exchange to the lying stock-jobber in the market town, all pressed vigorously for
new issues of paper; all were apparently able to demonstrate to the people that in new issues
of paper lay the only chance for national prosperity.

This great debtor class, relying on the multitude who could be approached by superficial arguments,
soon gained control. Strange as it might seem to those who have not watched the same causes
at work at a previous period in France and at various times in other countries, while every
issue of paper money really made matters worse, a superstition gained ground among the people
at large that, if only enough paper money were issued and were more cunningly handled the poor
would be made rich. Henceforth, all opposition was futile. In December, 1791, a report was
made in the Legislative Assembly in favor of yet another great issue of three hundred millions
more of paper money. In regard to this report Cambon said that more money was needed but asked,
"Will you, in a moment when stock-jobbing is carried on with such fury, give it new power by
adding so much more to the circulation?" But such high considerations were now little regarded.
Dorisy declared, "There is not enough money yet in circulation; if there were more the sales
of national lands would be more rapid." And the official report of his speech states that these
words were applauded.

Dorisy then went on to insist that the government lands were worth at least thirty-five hundred
million livres and said: "Why should members ascend the tribunal and disquiet France? Fear
nothing; your currency reposes upon a sound mortgage." Then followed a glorification of the
patriotism of the French people, which, he asserted, would carry the nation through all its
difficulties.

Becquet, speaking next, declared that "The circulation is becoming more rare every day."

On December 17, 1791, a new issue was ordered, making in all twenty-one hundred millions authorized.
Coupled with this was the declaration that the total amount in actual circulation should never
reach more than sixteen hundred millions. Before this issue the value of the 100 livres note
had fallen at Paris to about 80 livres; [38] immediately afterward it fell to about 68 livres.
What limitations of the currency were worth may be judged from the fact that not only had the
declaration made hardly a year before, limiting the amount in circulation to twelve hundred
millions, been violated, but the declaration, made hardly a month previous, in which the Assembly
had as solemnly limited the amount of circulation to fourteen hundred millions, had also been
repudiated.

The evils which we have already seen arising from the earlier issues were now aggravated; but
the most curious thing evolved out of all this chaos was a new system of political economy. My desire to write this novel
has not gone away ever. What has vanished is my hope. To write as I figure it was necessary to
gather and form a vast apparatus of scholarship, and for this I always lacked patience. Today,
to my misfortune, besides patience, I miss the view. I can not see the multitude of tomes, ancient
and modern, written in different languages, where I would take the local and temporal color my projected
work required. The work, therefore, must remain in the project. And since it is planned to free
myself from his obsession and to prove to you that if I can, I want to please, I'll put here in
a very short project summary.

       * * * * * In the reign of Alhakem I, for the years 218 of the Hegira,
was in Cordoba, a wealthy merchant named Abu HafÃ¡z the Goleith, a
native of nearby site of Fohs Albolut.

In his bazaar, located in one of the main streets, were gathered the most precious objects of
human industry and of what occurred in the Iberian Peninsula as it brought from remote regions of
Baghdad, Damascus, Bocara of Samarkand, Persia, India and the little known vast empire of Cathay.
Abu HafÃ¡z ships had their own, they went to the Levant ports to provide themselves with goods. On
a spring afternoon came in the bazaar of Abu HafÃ¡z a lady covered, accompanied by her maid. Although
he did not see his face, he admired the grace and elegance of her
walk, leanness and elegance of her figure, a certain ineffable prestige
seductive as the bright halo around it, and the aristocratic beauty
of its white, beautiful and well manicured hands.

The lady wanted to see how much more rich in the bazaar had. Abu HafÃ¡z, full of pleasure, was offering before
his eyes, and putting on the counter, a thousand strange beauties
of jewelry and fabrics. She is not satisfied with looking. He was very
curious. The merchant said - yet I have shown, Sultana, the most splendid
treasures pilgrim my store. - And why hide it and do not you show
me? - She said. - Because I am interested and do not want to work
for nothing.

Show me your face and in return I'll show my best wealth

.
 Soon payment was suspended on dues to public
creditors for all amounts exceeding ten thousand francs.

This was hailed by many as a measure in the interests of the poorer classes of people, but
the result was that it injured them most of all. Henceforward, until the end of this history,
capital was quietly taken from labor and locked up in all the ways that financial ingenuity
could devise. All that saved thousands of laborers in France from starvation was that they
were drafted off into the army and sent to be killed on foreign battlefields.

On the last day of July, 1792, came another brilliant report from Fouquet, showing that the
total amount of currency already issued was about twenty-four hundred millions, but claiming
that the national lands were worth a little more than this sum. A decree was now passed issuing
three hundred millions more. D. Fruela, from Ovideo, has been accused
of high treason and should be sentenced to death. His accuser was D. Raymond, of Butler Palace.
Three of D. Raimundo's family were ready to support attacks against defenders of D. Fruela, who had
appealed to divine law. However, D Raymond was so powerful, feared, and arrogant, and D.Fruela
was so hated, that nobody came to his defense. The deadline was only three days away.
 No more striking
example can be seen of the truth uttered by Daniel Webster, that "of all the contrivances for
cheating the laboring classes of mankind, none has been more effective than that which deludes
them with paper-money." [41]

Issue after issue followed at intervals of a few months, until, on December 14, 1792, we have
an official statement to the effect that thirty-five hundred millions had been put forth, of
which six hundred millions had been burned, leaving in circulation twenty-eight hundred millions.

When it is remembered that there was little business to do and that the purchasing power of
the livre or franc, when judged by the staple products of the country, was equal to about half
the present purchasing power of our own dollar, it will be seen into what evils France had
drifted. 

My distinguished friend, for the Liberal, next Sunday, you asked me to write about things from the
time I spent in the island of Crete. Great is my desire to please you, but there are two difficulties.
As disclosed by mythologists and historians, what can I say that I have any news, other than a statement
of what they said, and is not in any dictionary, or rather encyclopedia?
 An estimate in 1793 made the
value of these estates three billions of francs. 

For five consecutive days were great celebrations in Oviedo. Bernardo weddings Carpio and Elvira
took place while the Count of Saldaña and Dona Ximena.

A few days later found out that Don Raymond, the butler de Palacio, who had been Bernardo stole
the child and who ordered the killing, angry and scorned suitor was Dona Ximena. The killers,
responsible for killing the child, had taken pity on him and had
exposed to the castle gate D. Fruela.ll, and four hundred workmen were added to those previously
engaged in furnishing this paper money, and these were so pressed with work from six o'clock
in the morning until eight in the evening that they struck for higher wages and were successful.
