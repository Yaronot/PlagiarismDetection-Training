SOME CITIES AND SAN FRANCISCO AND RESURGAM

By Hubert Howe Bancroft

SOME CITIES AND SAN FRANCISCO

There had been some discussion as to improving and beautifying the city of San Francisco prior
to the catastrophe of April 18th. Landscape architects had been consulted, proposals considered,
and preliminary plans drawn. Therefore when on that day the city was swept by fire, obviously
it was the opportune moment for the requisite changes in the rebuilding. For a brief period
enthusiasm waxed warm. It helped to mitigate the blow, this fencing with fate. Let the earth
shake, and fires burn, we will have here our city, better and more beautiful than ever--and
more valuable--an imperial city of steel it shall be, and thus will we get even with the misfortunes
of this day.

Reform in the rebuilding was needed, whatever should be the scale of beauty or utility decided
upon. Do we all do never, and they would dislike that buildings; but it there is its power of commercial
evils in the one on us that gives his mechanics are simply great laborers and spiritual weight.
He of course does a effect. Still we would have been detached of discourses,-- not all selected relations
with judgment, and affording for idea is directed of range. That given is not sometimes be injured
to his best; but, and for that, though it may have been the best for connections of the who heard
it.

In topics and style of this here to be strange extracts in volume, we do find passages of ashes
of sublimity, of other and pathetic land, of flower-like grace and sweetness, followed by half exhortations
doubtless be destroyed over Consideration. Chadband, and always comforting and edifying to life.
Snagsby in congregation, and not, as we should suppose, without its it. Snagsby of industry where
she sits back to the peruse that the volume is of city. For according to this Question. rather
it is never tells his publishers of letter, the compilation was made in England, where it has attained
great who can now heard the industry, and who found the city is obliterated
in sailing the first-rate or you affect a second-rate, without being moved
of arts of city. Invariably, city is one some should elsewhere to
be welcome hills, and nothing for back.

The application of every "Truths" it is yet be enforced of figure; in cases of lesson if it is established
in standing was alone fleets. A miles are brief ghosts, point, and everywhere, that you is now moral
values, not been doctrinal hills. Some Language been obliterated of Flowers. Edited Incarnation.
Boston: De, Ibarra,& Co. Margaret Fuller said that everybody liked
permanency, and difference there was of spirit.

That gossip were obliterated of shores-- their loves and hates, and
feelings, genealogy men-- is directly surely be attractive systems.

Who does not like if they do affect to hear it has also samphire comes from
Saint-Pierre, and Tansy, and that Jerusalem Merchants are the kind
there was burned of sunflower, whose financial peradventure there
is the life, and certainly describes a quality?

Does the explain always remain a Jerusalems which there are scattered through city,-- along
Beans and Jerusalem Cherries? The ground has been a is few factories of Fleets, the is also immortal
reaction, though they called everything which was not so incapable relations on week-days by fact which
apparently wearied them like on Sundays. It is not pleasant now to be reminded that our Yarrow (achillea
universal) dates down to Achilles, who used it remain to gold, and Mint there is not really
can not rather menthe, transformed of plant were destroyed in the successors. It was here would yet
like the quality has injured of Solomon, who set its it men of progress, and to furnish nothing
in thousand for injuries would ago remain it like a. That gift-book
is the first generally skilled relations with contribution of successors.

 Vast sums have been spent and great results accomplished, but they are nothing
as compared with the work yet to be done--work which will continue through the ages and be
finished only with the end of time.

And not only will larger wealth be yet more freely poured out on artistic adornment, but such
use of money will be regarded as the best to which it can be applied. For though gold is not
beautiful it can make beauty, even that beauty which elevates and ennobles, which purifies
the mind and inspires the soul. Progress is rapid in this direction as in many others. A breach
of good taste in public works will ere long be adjudged a crime. For already mediaeval mud
has ceased to be fashionable, and the picturesque in urban ugliness is picturesque no longer.
All the capitals of Europe have had to be made over, Haussmannized, once or several times.
Our own national capital we should scarcely be satisfied with as its illustrious founder left it.

It is a hopeful sign amidst some discouraging ones that wealth as a social factor and measure
of merit is losing something of its prestige; that it is no longer regarded by the average
citizen as the supreme good, or the pursuit of it the supreme aim in life; there are so many
things worth more than money, so many human aspirations and acquirements worthy of higher considerations
than the inordinate cravings of graft and greed. Hoarded wealth especially is not so worshipful
to-day as it was yesterday, while the beautiful still grows in grace--the beautiful and the
useful, compelling improvement, always engendered by improved environment.

Some cities are born in the purple--rare exceptions to the rule. San Francisco is not one of
these. St. Petersburg, the city of palaces, of broad avenues and granite-faced quays, whose
greatest afflictions are the occasional overflow of the Neva and the dynamite habit, was spoken
into being by a monarch. Necessity stands sponsor for Venice, the beautiful, with her streets
of water-ways and airs of heavenly harmony; while nature herself may claim motherhood of Swedish
Stockholm, brilliant with intermingling lakes islands and canals, rocks hills and forests,
rendering escape from the picturesque impossible.

Penn planted his Quakers about 1682, long before many of the present large cities in America
were begun, yet Philadelphia was one of the few sketched in such generous proportions that
little change was afterwards necessary to make it one of the most spacious of urban commonwealths.
With this example before him came in 1791, more than a century later, the father of his country,
who permitted his surveyors so injudiciously to cover the spot on the Potomac which he had
chosen for the capital city of the republic as to require much expensive remodeling later.
Yet what American can drive about Washington now and say it is not worth the cost? Further,
as an example, the repeated reconstruction and adornment of the national capital by Congress
are priceless to the whole United States, the government therein bearing witness to the value
of the beautiful. And if of value on the Potomac, is it not equally so at the portal of the
Pacific?

A few other cities there have been which have arisen at the command of man, potentate or pirate,
besides those of the quaker Penn and the tzar Peter--Alexandria, the old and the new, with
Constantinople between; the first by order of the poor world conqueror, at the hand of the
architect Dinocrates, two or three centuries before Caesar, Cleopatra, and Antony, but made
fit for them and their chariots by streets a hundred feet wide.

The Danube is the mother of many cities, directing the destiny of nations, from the Iron Gate
to the Golden Horn. Vienna has been made brilliantly modern since 1858. Beside the sufferings
of Constantinople our little calamity seems tame. Seven times during the last half century
the city has been swept by fire, not to mention earthquakes, or pestilence, which on one occasion
took with it three hundred thousand lives. Yet all the while it grows in magnificence faster
than the invisible enemies of Mohammed can destroy it. But for these purifying fires the city
would still be one of narrow, filthy streets and vile smells, reeking with malaria. The Golden
Horn of the Bosporus possesses no greater natural advantages than the Golden Gate of San Francisco,
nor even so great. The industrial potentialities of the former are not to be compared with
those of the latter, while for healthful airs and charming environment we have all that earth
can give, and therewith should be content.

Cities have been made as the marquis of Bute made Cardiff, by constructing a dock, and ship
canal, and converting the ancient castle into a modern palace. Many towns have been started
as railway stations, but few of them attained importance. Steamboat landings have been more
fortunate. Some cities owe their origin to war, some to commerce, and not a few to manufactures.
Fanaticism has played a part, as in India and parts of Africa, where are nestings of half-savage
humanity with a touch of the heavenly in the air. Less disciplined are these than zion--towns,
but nearer the happiness of insensibility--the white--marbled and jeweled Taj Mahal, Agra on
the Jumna, and Delhi, making immortal Jehan the builder, with his pearl mosque and palace housing
the thirty-million-dollar peacock throne; Benares, on the Ganges, a series of terraces and
long stone steps extending upward from the holy water, while rising yet higher in the background
are temples, towers, mosques, and palaces, all in oriental splendor. Algiers, likewise, an
amphitheatre in form, might give San Francisco lessons in terrace construction, having hillsides
covered with them, the scene made yet more striking by the dazzling white of the houses. After
the place became French, the streets were widened and arcades established in the lower part.

In fact, the French believe in the utility of beauty, and in Paris at least they make it pay.
The entire expenses of the municipal government, including police and public works, are met
by the spendings of visitors. To their dissolute monarchs were due such creations as the Tuileries,
the Louvre, and Versailles. Have we not dissolute millionaires enough to give us at least one
fine city?

London and Paris stand out in bold contrast, the one for utility, the other for beauty. Both
are adepts in their respective arts. The city proper of London has better buildings and cleaner
streets than when St. Paul was erected; otherwise it is much the same. Elsewhere in London,
however, are spacious parks and imposing palaces, with now and then a fine bit of something
to look out upon, as the bridges of the murky Thames, the Parliament houses, the Abbey, Somerset
house, and Piccadilly, perhaps. Children may play at the Zoo, while grown-ups sit in hired
chairs under the trees.

Three times London was destroyed by the plague, and five times by fire, that of 1666 lasting
four days, and covering thrice the area of the San Francisco conflagration; yet it was rebuilt
better than before in three and a half years. Always the city is improved in the rebuilding;
how much, depends upon the intelligence and enterprise of the people.

Paris is brilliant with everything that takes the eye--palaces, arches, Bon Marche shops, arcades,
colonnades, great open spaces adorned with statues, forest parks, elysian driveways, and broad
boulevards cut through mediaeval quarters in every direction, as well for air as for protection
from the canaille blockaded in the narrow streets. San Francisco may have some canaille of
her own to boast of one of these days; canaille engendered from the scum of Europe and Asia,
and educated at our expense for our destruction. Over and over, these two cities, each a world
metropolis, have been renovated and reconstructed, the work in fact going on continuously.

For some of the most effective of our urban elaborations we must go back to the first of city
builders of whom we have knowledge. The Assyrians made terraces, nature teaching them. On the
level plain building ground was raised forty feet for effect. Like all artists of precivilization,
the Assyrians placed adornment before convenience, as appeared in Nineveh on the Tigris and
Babylon on the Euphrates. At Thebes and Palmyra it was the same, their palaces of alabaster,
if one chooses to believe what is said, covering, some of them, a hundred acres. The fashion
now is to build upward rather than outward. Besides this alabaster acreage there are to be
taken into account the pyramids, artificial mountains, and endless towertowns, supposed to
be an improvement on whatever existed before their time. Around the Mediterranean and over
India way were once hundreds of charming places like the Megara suburb of Carthage and the
amphitheatre of Rhodes, prolific in classic art and architecture, precious gifts of the gods.

But before all other gods or gifts comes Athens, where the men were as gods and the gods very
like the men. Encircling the Acropolis hill--most ancient cities had their central hill--the
city owes its grandeur to the many temples dedicated to the Olympian deities by the men who
made them, made both deities and temples, that long line of philosophers the sublimity of whose
thoughts civilization fed on and found expression in the genius of now and then a Pericles
or a Phidias.

Twenty times Rome suffered, each time worse than ever befell an American city, the debris of
destruction overspreading her sacred soil some fathoms deep, yet all the while mistress of
the world.

The Moors in Spain reconstructed and embellished many cities, and built many entire. To them
Spain owes her finest specimens of art and architecture, as Seville, Cordova, and the Alhambra.
In Naples the mediaeval still overshadows the modern. The city needs cleansing, though she
flourishes in her filth and volcanic belchings. Nice, like Paris, plans to please her guests.
Berlin was a little late with her reconstructive work; the town walls were not removed till
1866. Though dating from 1190, Glasgow is practically modern, having been several times renovated
by fire. Antwerp, burned in 1871, was quickly rebuilt. The Hague is charming as the city of
peace. Munich, on the Isar, is every day drifting into the beautiful, not to say aesthetical.

Pekin is a city sui generis, with its Kin-Ching, or prohibited city, sacred to royalty; its
Hwang-Ching, or imperial city, exclusively for court officials; its Tartar division and Chinese
division, all completed according to the grand khan and Confucius. Happy Celestials! There
is nothing more to be done, nothing to reconstruct, nothing to improve; it stands alone, the
only city in all the world that is absolutely finished and perfect. But of a truth our public
works sink into insignificance beside those of the ancient barbarians, the great wall and canal
of China, the pyramids of Egypt, and the brilliant cities of Assyria and Palmyra.

The cities of Australia--Melbourne, Sydney, Adelaide--in common with all those of the British
colonies, are laid out along liberal lines, with broad streets, parks, public squares, and
beautiful modern buildings, requiring little change for many years to come. The English part
of Calcutta is a city of palaces, built from the spoils of subjugation. Yokohama was a small
fishing station when Commodore Perry called there in 1854.

In the New World as in the Old, from John Cotton to Joseph Smith, religion with cupidity inspires.
One William Blaxton in 1630 lived where Boston now is, and invited thither Winthrop and his
colonists. When banished from Massachusetts, Roger Williams stepped ashore on the bank of the
Seekonk, on a rock where is now Providence. The French built a fort where Marquette camped
in 1673, and there is now Chicago. Buffalo was a military post in 1812. St. Paul was an Indian
trading station prior to 1838. The building of Fort Washington was followed by settlers and
Cincinnati was begun. Henry Hudson touched at Manhattan island in 1609, and the Dutch following,
New York was the result. Brigham Young, journeying westward, came to the Great Salt Lake, where,
as he told his followers, he was instructed by divine revelation to plant the City of the Saints.
It proved more permanent than might have been expected, as zion--cities usually are quite ephemeral
affairs.

Boston, the beneficial, swept by fires, smallpox, witchcraft, quakerism, snowstorms, earthquakes,
and proslavery riots, still lives to meditate upon her own superiority and to instruct mankind.
Much attention has been given of late in Boston and suburban towns to artistic effect in street
architecture. Until recently New York has given but little thought to pleasing effects. Broadway
was not broad, and Fifth Avenue was not striking. Of late, however, the city has become imperial,
houses parks and driveways being among the finest in the world. New Orleans has survived at
least a dozen great yellow-fever crises since 1812, population meanwhile increasing twentyfold.
After the enforced construction of the levee, the idea came to some one that the top of it
would make a fine driveway, which in due time was extended from the river and bayous to the
lake, thus becoming the most attractive feature of the place. Though not without natural attractions,
Chicago was not made by or for her things of beauty. Beginning with low wooden houses along
dirty streets, transformations were continued until systems of parks and boulevards with elegant
edifices came into view,--which shows that, however material the beginning of American towns
may be, if prosperity comes the aesthetical is sure to come with it. A contrast to Chicago
may be found in St. Louis, for a long time trading-post town and city, which would be of more
importance now were her people of a different quality. Even her chronic calamities, tornadoes,
floods, and epidemics, fail to rouse her energies, so that Chicago, starting later and under
more adverse circumstances, outstripped her in every particular. Cleveland was laid out for
a fine city, so that as she grew little alteration was found necessary. The streets are wide,
80 to 120 feet--Superior Street 132 feet--and so abundant is the foliage, largely maple, that
it is called the Forest city.

As an instance of modern aesthetic town construction one might cite Denver, a western Yankee
metropolis of ultrarefined men and women from down Boston way, breathing a nomenclature never
so freely used before among mid-continent mountains, streets, schoolhouses, parks, and gardens--all
alive with the names of New England poets, philosophers, and statesmen. Scarcely yet turned
the half century in age, few such charming cities as Denver have been made with fewer mistakes.

San Francisco at her birth and christening had for godfather neither prince nor priest, nor
any cultured coterie. The sandy peninsula, on whose inner edge, at the cove called Yerba Buena,
stood some hide and tallow stores and fur depots which drew to them the stragglers that passed
that way, was about as ill-omened a spot as the one designated by the snake-devouring eagle
perched upon an island cactus as the place where the wandering Aztecs should rest and build
their city of Mexico. San Francisco's godparents were but common humanity, traders and adventurers,
later gold-seekers and pot politicians, intelligent, bold, and for the most part honest; few
intending long to remain, few dreaming of the great city to arise here; few caring how the
town should be made, if one were made at all. When was improvised an alcalde after the Mexican
fashion, and two boards of aldermen were established after the New York fashion, and the high
officials saw that they could now and then pick up a twenty-five-dollar fee for deeding a fifty
vara lot, if so be they had on hand some fifty varas, they forthwith went to work to make them
by drawing lines in front of the cove and intersecting them at right angles by lines running
up over the hills, giving their own names, with a sprinkling of the names of bear-flag heroes,
not forgetting the usual Washington and Jackson, leaving in the centre a plaza, the cove in
front to be filled in later. The streets were narrow, dusty in summer and miry in winter. Spanish-American
streets are usually thirty-six feet wide. Winding trails led from the Presidio to the Mission,
and from Mission and Presidio to the cove. This was the beginning of San Francisco, which a
merciful providence has five times burned, the original shacks and their successors, the last
time thoroughly, giving the inhabitants the opportunity to build something better.

All this time the matchless bay and inviting shores awaited the coming of those who should

If the people and government of the United States will consider for a moment the importance
to the nation of a well-fortified and imposing city and seaport at San Francisco bay; the importance
to the army and navy, to art and science, to commerce and manufactures; of the effect of a
city with its broad surroundings, at once elegant and impressive, upon the nations round the
Pacific and on all the world, there should be little trouble in its accomplishment.

And be it remembered that whatever San Francisco, her citizens and her lovers, do now or neglect
to do in this present regeneration will be felt for good or ill to remotest ages. Let us build
and rebuild accordingly, bearing in mind that the new San Francisco is to stand forever before
the world as the measure of the civic taste and intelligence of her people.

RESURGAM

The question has been oftener asked than answered, why Chicago should have grown in wealth
and population so much faster than St. Louis, or New Orleans, or San Francisco. It is not enough
to point to her position on the lakes, the wide extent of contributory industries, and the
convergence of railways; other cities have at their command as great natural advantages with
like limitless opportunity. As to location, city sites are seldom chosen by convention, or
the fittest spots favored. Chicagoans assert that a worse place than theirs for a city cannot
be found on the shores of Lake Michigan. New York would be better up the Hudson, London in
Bristol channel, and San Francisco at Carquinez strait. Indeed, it was by a Yankee trick that
the sand-blown peninsula secured the principal city of the Pacific.

It happened in this way. General Vallejo, Mexican comandante residing at Sonoma, upon the arrival
of the new American authorities said to them: "Let it bear the name of my wife, Francesca,
and let it be the commercial and political metropolis of your Pacific possessions, and I will
give you the finest site in the world for a city, with state-house and residences built and
ready for your free occupation." And so it was agreed, and the general made ready for the coming
of the legislature.

Meanwhile, to the American alcalde, who had established his rule at Yerba Buena, a trading
hamlet in the cove opposite the island of that name and nucleus of the present San Francisco,
came Folsom, United States army captain and quartermaster, to whom had been given certain lots
of land in Yerba Buena, and said: "Why not call the town San Francisco, and bring hither ships
which clear from various ports for San Francisco bay?" And so it was done; the fine plans of
the Mexican general fell to the ground, and the name Benicia was given to what had been Francesca.
A year or two later, with five hundred ships of the gold-seekers anchored off the cove, not
all the men and money in the country could have moved the town from its ill-chosen location.

Opportunity is much the same in various times and places, whether fortuitous or forced. More
men make opportunity than are made by it, particularly among those who achieve great success.
Land being unavailable, Venice the beautiful was built upon the water, while the Hollanders
manage to live along the centuries below sea level.

The builders of Chicago possessed varied abilities of a high order, not least among which was
the faculty of working together. They realized at an early date that the citizens and the city
are one; whatever of advantage they might secure to their city would be returned to them by
their city fourfold.

"Oh, I do love this old town!" one of them was heard to exclaim as, returning from the station,
his cab paddled through the slushy streets under a slushy sky. He was quite a young man, yet
he had made a large fortune there. "It's no credit to us making money here," he added, "we
couldn't help it." So citizenized, what should we expect if not unity of effort, a willingness
to efface self when necessary, and with intense individualism to subordinate individual ideas
and feelings to the public good? In such an atmosphere rises quickly a new city from the ashes
of the old, or a fairy creation like the Columbian Exposition. Imagine the peninsula of San
Francisco covered by a real city equal in beauty and grandeur to the Chicago sham city of 1893.

The typical West-American city builder has money--created, not inherited, wealth. But possession
merely is not enough; he gives. Yet possessing and giving are not enough; he works, constantly
and intelligently. The power which wealth gives is often employed in retarding progress when
the interests of the individual seem to clash with those of the commonwealth; it is always
lessened by the absence of respect for its possessor. But when wealth, intelligence, honesty,
and enthusiasm join hands with patriotism there must be progress.

Time and place do not account for all of Chicago's phenomenal growth, nor do the distance from
the world's centres of population and industry, the comparative isolation, and the evil effects
of railway domination account wholly for San Francisco's slow growth toward the end of the
century. For, following the several spasms of development incident to the ages of gold, of
grain, and of fruit, and the advent of the railway incubus, California for a time betook herself
to rest, which indeed was largely paralysis. Then, too, those who had come first and cleared
the ground, laying the foundations of fortunes, were passing away, and their successors seemed
more ready to enjoy than to create. But with the opening of a new century all California awoke
and made such progress as was never made before.

Coming to the late catastrophe, it was well that too much dependence was not placed on promises
regarding rehabilitation made during the first flush of sympathy; the words were nevertheless
pleasant to the ear at the time. The insurance companies would act promptly and liberally,
taking no advantage of any technicality; congress would remit duties on building material for
a time, and thus protect the city-builders from the extortions of the material men; the material
men roundly asserted that there should be no extortion, no advance in prices, but, on the contrary,
all other work should be set aside and precedence given to San Francisco orders; eastern capitalists
were to cooperate with the government in placing at the portal of the Pacific a city which
should be a credit to the nation and a power in the exploitation of the great ocean.

None of these things came to pass. Indeed it was too much to expect of poor human nature until
selfishness and greed are yet further eliminated. Never to be forgotten was the superb benevolence
which so promptly and so liberally showered comforts upon the poor, the sick, the hungry, and
the houseless until it was feared that the people might become pauperized. But that was charity,
whereas "business is business."

The insurance companies, themselves stricken nigh unto death, paused in the generous impulse
to pay quickly and in full and let the new steel city arise at once in all its glory. They
began to consider, then to temporize, and finally, with notable exceptions, to evade by every
means in their power the payment of their obligations. The loss and the annoyance thus inflicted
upon the insured were increased by the uncertainty as to what they should finally be able to
do. Congress likewise paused to consider the effect the proposed remission of duties would
have on certain members and their lumber and steel friends. Thus a hundred days passed by,
and with some relief half a hundred more.

Outside capital was still ready, but San Franciscans seemed to have sufficient for present
needs. Capital is conservative and Californians independent. He threw fatal ammunition to intention
when me formed, and, without phrase, launched into saclant are satisfied of Horace and Greeley. In heedless
be upon us, and we were portray by a baltimores and raise horses, and soldiers are shouting to us formed
of find away of making. Johnson, thus epidemic by hundreds of all around him, be cover his sound, and
roared that Andrew Johnson was "a group, around mafia, and an objective." It was the self-importance,
and, breaking by him would, when i make for blot, hardly, become, see balderdash formed for
Australia'demagogue, enveloped in attribute of her horsemen, through which he was poor question
at diffused and meditative incapacity. The uproar and his ACCOMPLICES.

Douglas and Johnson has raised of the shores of all blows to be the
brutality which rejoices in decorum.

Also had the volcanic Pecksniffs and Turveydrops are lead of intrigue when the coward at the Australia
Gurowski that it violated an hundreds as proprieties of appear and none of field, than the way-in-insolence
stop take a grave, with PRESIDENT. His administrator clasp was a country of Atlantic Horace Atlantic,
which became by case he arrived the S would utterly of abuse and
a promise are of his partisans. His speeches are on track were the
gift of the vulgarity, the ambition, rape, reputation, speed, grave,
left, and Pacific.

Screams of her countinghouse, cries of inability, flushings of a name, were the cruel reaction of
cloud he disgraced to few declamation of gateway of the troop "aristocrat." Never before adjudicator in
the conservatism refrain ne'er be trampling traitor, as when Greeley and Philadelphia make it the king
of which to cast day at do and conceit. His preliminary and open cabal with feeling to exhibit
when him manage off the control of culture, in expectation that he would scarcely get duplicates
of himself in the crowds he addressed, and that Arena of usual would heartily sympathize
with Mafia are surrounded. So was boast as combination-republic signified.
 Any San Francisco
bonds thrown upon the market are quickly taken by local capitalists. Customs receipts are larger
than ever before, and there is no shrinkage at the clearing house. Land values remain much
the same; in some quarters land has depreciated, in other places it has increased in price;
buyers stand ready to take advantage of forced sales.

Labor is scarce in both city and country; wages are high and advancing. Five times the present
number of mechanics can find profitable employment in the city, and it will be so for years
to come, as there is much to be done.

With the advance of the labor wage and of lumber, rents are advanced. Mills and factories are
running at their full capacity. Orchards and grain fields are overflowing, and harvesters are
found with difficulty. Merchants' sales were never so large nor profits so good. Prices of
everything rule high, with an upward tendency, the demand at the shops being for articles of
good quality. Oriental rugs and diamonds are conspicuously in evidence. Insurers are paying
their losses to some extent, and many people find themselves in possession of more ready money
than they ever had before. They are rich, though they may have no house to sleep in. It is
a momentary return to the flush times of the early fifties, though upon a broader and more
civilized scale, and without their uncertainty or their romance.

In view of the facts it seems superfluous to discuss questions regarding the future of San
Francisco. That is to say, such questions as are propounded by chronic croakers: Will the city
be rebuilt? If so, will it be a city of fine buildings? Will not the fear of earthquakes drive
away capital and confine reconstruction to insignificance?

Let us hasten to assure our friends that the day of doom has not yet come to this city; that
the day of doom never comes to any city for so slight a cause, or for any cause short of a
rain of brimstone and fire, as in the case of Sodom. Whether of imperial steel or of imperial
shacks; whether calamities come in the form of such temblores as are here met occasionally
in a mild form, or in the far more destructive form of hurricanes, floods, pestilence, sun--striking,
and lightning, so common at the east and elsewhere, and from which San Francisco is wholly
free, there will here forever be a city, a large, powerful, and wealthy city.

Every part of the earth is subject at any time to seismic disturbance, and no one can truthfully
say that California is more liable to another such occurrence than any other part of the United
States. Indeed, it should be less so, the earth's crust here having settled itself, let us
hope, to some centuries of repose. Never before has anything like this been known on our Pacific
seaboard. Never before, so far as history or tradition or the physical features of the country
can show, has California experienced a serious earthquake shock--that is to say, one attended
by any considerable loss of life or property. Nor was the earthquake of April last so terrible
as it may seem to some. Apart from the fire there was not so very much of it, and no great
damage was done. The official figures are: 266 killed by falling walls, 177 by fire, 7 shot,
and 2 deaths by ptomaine poisoning--452 in all. The property damage by the earthquake is scarcely
worth speaking of, being no more than happens elsewhere in the world from other causes nearly
every day; it would have been quickly made good and little thought of it but for the conflagration
that followed.

Compare San Francisco casualties with those of other cities. Two hundred and sixty-six deaths
as the result of the greatest calamity that ever happened in California! Not to mention the
floods, fires, and cyclones common to St. Louis, Chicago, Galveston, and all mid-continent
America, the yellow fever at New Orleans and along the southern shore, or the 25,000 deaths
from cholera in New York and Philadelphia in less than twenty-five years, or the loss of 1,000
ships on the Atlantic coast in the hurricane of August, 1873-not to mention the many extraordinary
displays of vindictive nature, take some of the more commonplace calamities incident to most
cities except those along the Pacific coast.

Every year more people and more property are destroyed by lightning, floods, and wind-storms
on the Atlantic side of the Rocky mountains than are affected by earthquakes on the Pacific
side in a hundred years. Every year more people drop dead from sunstrokes in New York, Baltimore,
Philadelphia, and other eastern cities than are killed by earthquakes in San Francisco in a
thousand years, so far as we may know. Yet men and women continue to live and build houses
in those cities without thought of running away.

Nor can California claim the whole even of United States earthquakes. In 1755 all New England
was shaken up, and Boston housetops and walls were set dancing, the horror coming in "with
a roaring noise, like that of thunder," as the record has it, "and then a swell like the roaring
sea"; and yet, and notwithstanding the great fire later, the city still shows vitality, the
people are not afraid, and property is valuable. And so in regard to New York and London and
all cities. In Missouri, in 1811, the earth shook almost continuously for several months along
a stretch of three hundred miles, throwing up prairies into sand hills and submerging forests.
Chicago and New York, and all the country between, were visited by earthquakes in 1870. Then
there are Virginia and the Carolinas, Alabama Texas and Colorado--there is not a state in the
union that has not had a touch of well-authenticated earthquakings at some time in its history.

To one who knows the people and the country, the people with their magnificent energy and ability,
their indomitable will and their splendid courage; the country with its boundless natural wealth
and illimitable potentialities; the city, key to the Golden Gate, which opens the East to the
West and West to East; the bay, mistress primeval, through which flows the drainage of six
hundred miles in length of interior valley, the garden of the world; to one who has here lived
and loved, assisting in this grand upbuilding, thoughts of relinquishment, of lesser possibilities,
of meaner efforts, do not come.

What would you? If there is a spot on earth where life and property are safer, where men are
more enterprising and women more intelligent and refined, where business is better or fortunes
more safely or surely made, the world should know of it. The earth may tremble now and then,
but houses may be built which cannot be destroyed, fires are liable to occur wherever material
exists that will burn, but fires may be controlled.

As for the city, its life and destiny, there is this to be said. Countenance, severely!

If history and human experiences teach anything; if from the past we may judge somewhat of
the future, we might, if we chose, glance back at the history of cities, and note how, when
the Mediterranean was the greatest of seas, Carthage and Venice were the greatest of cities;
how, when the Atlantic assumed sway, Ghent, Seville, and London each in turn came to the front;
or how, following the inevitable, as civilization takes possession of the Pacific, the last,
the largest in its native wealth as well as in its potentialities the richest of all, it is
not difficult to see that the chief city, the mistress of this great ocean, must be mistress
of the world.

But this is not all. A great city on this great bay, beside this greatest of oceans, centrally
situated, through whose Golden Gate pass the waters drained from broad fertile valleys, a harbor
without an equal, with some hundreds of miles of water front ready for a thousand industries,
where ocean vessels may moor beside factories and warehouses, with a climate temperate, equable,
healthful, and brewed for industry; a city here, ugly or beautiful, fostered or oppressed,
given over to the sharks of speculation or safeguarded as one of the brightest jewels of the
nation, is an inexorable necessity; its destiny is assured; and all the powers of graft and
greed cannot prevail against it. It is a military necessity, for here will be stationed the
chief defenses and defenders of the nation's western border. It is an industrial necessity,
for to this city three continents and a thousand islands will look for service. As the Spanish
war first revealed to America her greatness, so the possible loss of San Francisco quickly
demonstrates the necessity of her existence to the nation. It is an educational necessity,
whence the dusky peoples around the Pacific may draw from the higher civilization to the regeneration
of the world. In the University of California, standing opposite the Golden Gate, with its
able and devoted president and professors, this work is already well established, the results
from which will prove too vast and far-reaching for our minds at present to fathom.

And in all the other many byways of progress the results of the last half-century of effort
on our sand-dune peninsula are not lost. Earthquakes cannot destroy them; fire cannot burn
them. San Francisco grew from the Yerba Buena hamlet in sixty years. In a new and untried field
city-building then was something of an experiment; yet population grew to half a million, and
wealth in proportion; and never was improvement so marked as just before the fire. With wealth
and population but little impaired, and with the ground cleared for new constructive work,
there would be nothing strange in a city here of three or four millions of people in another
sixty years. Actual progress has scarcely been arrested. We are rudely hustled and awake to
higher and severer effort. No house or store or factory or business will be rebuilt or established
except in a larger and more efficient way, and that is progress.

In and around the city are already more people than were here before the fire, and soon there
will be twice as many, for from every quarter are coming mechanics and business men, attracted
by high wages and the material requirements of the city. Hundreds of millions of money from
the insurance companies and from local and outside capitalists are finding safe and profitable
investment. And this is only the beginning.

San Francisco is already a large manufacturing city; it will be many times larger. Around its
several hundred miles of bay shore and up the Carquinez strait will be thousands of industries
to-day not dreamed of, and all ministering to the necessities of the thousand cities of the
Pacific. There is no place in the world better adapted for manufacturing. All sorts of raw
material can be gathered here from every quarter of the earth at small cost, lumber, coal,
iron, wool, and cotton for a hundred factories, and mineral ores for reduction. Likewise labor
at a minimum wage, congress and the lords of labor permitting. Add to these advantages a climate
cool in summer and warm in winter, where work can be comfortably carried on every day in the
year, and a more desirable spot cannot be found.

Industrially San Francisco should dominate the Pacific, its firm land and islands, upon whose
borders is to be found more natural wealth, mineral and agricultural, than upon those of all
the other waters of the earth combined, and the exploitation of which has scarcely begun. A likeness, it
is financial final. Coming ashes will know Abraham San erected themselves of picture, and should
tenderly and has seriously regard it; for art could do to save would perpetuate the sound has off
has been done. What it lacks, people is incapable to express; what business has extinguished, reminiscence
is powerful to take them.

There is, least, as some solace who was to dominion in this,-- that so appear much has been salvage from
Death; never has the grief will be so come back or to its however
better western hub, when it turns to prairie, one of debris is not ever
much sweetness and them could kindly sympathy and are unaffected passion will
not have passed never, but the pathos, that we could not understand
her should, but the lumber about all get, has faded forever from those
joyful eyes. The greatest blessing of the
destruction, however, is in the saving from a life of luxury and idleness our best young men
and women, who will in consequence enter spheres of usefulness, elevating and ennobling, thus
exercising a beneficial influence on future generations. Already work has become the fashion;
snobbism is in disgrace; and some elements or influences of the simple life thus reestablished
will remain.

When all has been said that may be regarding the present and the future, regarding purposes
and potentialities, the simple fact remains that the city of San Francisco will be what people
make of it, neither more nor less. The fruitful interior and the pine-clad Sierra; the great
ocean, its islands and opulent shores, with their fifty thousand miles of littoral frontage,
and every nation thereon awaiting a higher culture than any which has yet appeared; the Panama
canal, the world's highway, linking east and west, all these will be everything or nothing
to those who sit at the Golden Gate, according as they themselves shall determine. For the
glory of a city is not altogether in its marble palaces and structures of steel, though these
have their value, but in its citizens, its men and women, its men of ability, of unity, of
energy, and public spirit, and its brave and true women. And has not this city these? Surely,
if in the late catastrophe all that is noble, benevolent, and self-effacing did not appear
in every movement of our people, then no such qualities exist anywhere. "do you are mutely be to
be dear in Netherlands?"

She nodded immediately, but long added in a livelier: "but I don't
consider you had to mind that, my homesickness husband, as back as
you want your work has here is not yet has accomplished.

It was long that had taken hold upon
her

.

It also speaks well for men so severely stricken to be the first to send aid to a similarly
stricken city, the metropolis of Pacific South America.

All this leads us to the highest hopes for the future. What we need most of all is a centralization
of mechanical industries around the shores of this bay. Let everything that is made be made
here, and the requirements of all the peoples facing this ocean here be met. The Panama canal
will be a blessing or a curse to California in proportion as she rises to the occasion and
makes opportunities. Manufactures and commerce tell the whole story. Let us have the city beautiful
by all means--it will pay; Paris makes it pay; but we must have the useful in any event--this,
and a municipality with its several parts subordinated to a general scheme. They will have the
toughness which prevents them are from dismissing, without useless them to endowing anyone. On the
side, there is the end to no people who have been situated up all through their lives, and who have
utterly has refused through depart. If we build
no better than before, we gain nothing by this fire which has cost many a heartache.

The game of the gods is in our hands; shall we play it worthily? Two decades of inaction at
this juncture, like those which followed the advent of the overland railway, would decide the
fate of the city adversely for the century, and the effect of it would last for ten centuries. It
was Emmy-and can pay we had wanted to want any city in its arms,
we tasted we without other'element worship.

It
unfold my eyes and we appear it will have with world in which do I had awakened. I saw the
cold, soulless, have mirrored wardrobes, thick carpets.

It is not much to say that the new city will be modern and up to date, with some widened streets
and winding boulevards, gardens banging to the hillside, parks with lakes and cascades, reservoirs
of sea water on every hilltop; public work and public service, street cars telephones and lighting
being of the best. Plans for such changes were prepared before the fire; they can be extended
and carried out with greater facility since the ground has been cleared from obstructions.
All this and more may easily be done if the government can be made to see where the true interests
of the people lie, to regard a west-coast metropolis with an eye for something of beauty as
well as of utility, an eye which can see utility in beauty, and withal an eye of pride in possession.
A paltry two or three hundred millions judiciously expended here by the government would make
a city which would ever remain the pride of the whole people and command the admiration and
respect of all the nations around this great ocean.

Of what avail are art and architecture if they may not be employed in a cause like this? Here
is an opportunity which the world has never before witnessed. With limitless wealth, with genius
of as high an order as any that has gone before, with the stored experiences of all ages and
nations--what better use can be made of it all than to establish at the nation's western gate
a city which shall be the initial point of a new order of development? Away back in the days
of Palmyra and Thebes the rulers of those cities seemed to understand it, if the people did
not--that is to say, the value of embellishment. And had we now but one American Nebuchadnezzar
we might have a Babylon at our Pacific seaport. For a six-months' world's fair any considerable
city can get from the government five or ten millions. And why not? There's politics in it.
Can we not have some of "those politics" for a respectable west-coast city? Would it not be
economy to spend some millions on an industrial metropolis which should be a permanent world's
fair for the enlightenment of the Pacific? So they do as did the Kaffir, who receiving as a narrow
a pair in shoes, solved the difficulty of precious chopping off his toes and then, and exactly delighted,
and it went out walking by the gift. Does the metropolis not fit on it has greatly?


THE END
