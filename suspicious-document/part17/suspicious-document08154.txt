"Suddenly--it could not have been much past three o'clock--a dozen rebel batteries opened upon
us, and in a second we were in a tempest of flying, bursting shells. Our guns, a few yards
away, and other batteries along our line, replied. The roar of the opening battle thundered
away to the right as far as we could hear. We were formed into line at once, and lay down upon
the ground. A few of our men were hit, however, and frightful wounds were inflicted. After
this iron storm had raged for a time we witnessed a sight that I shall never forget. Emerging
from the woods on the slope opposite to us, solid bodies of infantry, marching by columns of
battalion, came steadily toward us, their bayonets scintillating in the sunlight as if aflame.
On they came till they crossed the little stream before us, and then deployed into four distinct
lines of battle as steadily as if on parade. It was hard to realize that those men were marching
towards us in the bright sunlight with deadly intent. Heretofore, in Virginia, the enemy had
been partially screened in his approaches, but now all was like a panorama spread before us.
We could see our shells tearing first through their column, then through the lines of battle,
making wide gaps and throwing up clouds of dust. A second later the ranks were closed again,
and, like a dark tide, on flowed their advance.

"We asked ourselves, 'What chance have our thin ranks against those four distinct, heavy battle
lines advancing to assault us?' We had but two ranks of men, they eight. But not a man in our
regiment flinched. It will contain on list, and within miles around it, and of ladies whose fortune contingencies:

CHAPTER XXXIV.

A GLIMPSE OF WAR, CONTINUED.

"Miss Marian," resumed Blauvelt, "the scenes I am now about to describe are terrible in the
extreme, even in their baldest statement. I cannot portray what actually took place; I doubt
whether any one could; I can only give impressions of what I saw and heard when nearly all
of us were almost insane from excitement.  There are men who are cool in battle,--our colonel
was, outwardly,--but the great majority of men must be not only veterans, but also gifted with
unusual temperaments, to be able to remain calm and well balanced in the uproar of a bloody battle.

"In a sense, our men were veterans, and were steady enough to aim carefully as the enemy advanced
up the steep hill. Our shots told on them more fatally than theirs on us. The greater number
of us shared Strahan's impatience, and we longed for the wild, forward dash, which is a relief
to the tremendous nervous strain at such a time.  After a moment or two, that seemed ages,
the colonel quietly nodded to Strahan, who waved his sword, pointed towards the enemy, and
shouted, 'Charge!'

"You know him well enough to be sure that this was not an order for the men to fulfil while
he looked on. In a second his powerful bay sprung through the centre of our line, and to keep
up with him we had to follow on a run. There was no hesitation or flagging. Faces that had
been pale were flushed now. As I turned my eyes from moment to moment back to my company, the
terrible expression of the men's eyes impressed me even then. The colonel watched our impetuous
rush with proud satisfaction, and then spurred his horse to the very midst of our advance.
The lieutenant-colonel, undaunted by a former wound, never flinched a second, but wisely fought
on foot.

"The first battle-line of the enemy seemed utterly unable to stand before our fierce onset.
Those who were not shot fled.

"Again I saw Strahan waving his sword and shouting; 'Victory! Forward, men! forward!'

"He was in the very van, leading us all. At this moment the second rebel line fired a volley,
and the bullets swept by like an autumn gust through a tree from which the leaves, thinned
by former gales, are almost stripped. It seemed at the moment as if every other man went down.
Wonder of wonders, as the smoke lifted a little, I saw to the right the tall form of our colonel
still on his gray horse, pointing with his sword to the second rebel line, and shouting, 'Forward,
my men! forward!'

"As the order left his lips, his sword fell, point-downward, and, with a headlong curve, he
went over his horse upon the rocks below. Even in his death he went towards the enemy. His
horse galloped in the same direction, but soon fell. I thought that Strahan was gone also,
for he was hidden by smoke. A second later I heard his voice: 'Forward! Charge!'

"The men seemed infuriated by the loss of the colonel, and by no means daunted. Our next mad
rush broke the second line of the enemy.

"The scene now defies all my powers of description. The little handful of men that was left
of my company were almost beyond control. Each soldier was acting under the savage impulse
to follow and kill some rebel before him. I shared the feeling, yet remained sane enough to
thank God when I saw Strahan leap lightly down from his staggering horse, yet ever crying,
'Forward!' A second later the poor animal fell dead.

"Our own cannons were bellowing above us; the shells of the enemy were shrieking over our heads.
There was a continuous crash of musketry that sounded like a fierce, devouring flame passing
through dry thorns, yet above all this babel of horrid sounds could be heard the shouts and
yells of the combatants and the shrieks and groans of wounded and dying men. Then remember
that I saw but a little section, a few yards in width, of a battle extending for miles.

"In our mad excitement we did not consider the odds against us. The two remaining lines of
battle were advancing swiftly through the fugitives, and we struck the first with such headlong
impetuosity that it was repulsed and gave back; but the fourth and last line passing through,
and being reinforced by the other broken lines, came unfaltering, and swept us back from sheer
weight of numbers. We were now reduced to a mere skirmish line. It was at this moment that
I saw Strahan fall, and it seemed but a second later that the enemy's advance passed over the
spot. It was impossible then to rescue him, for the lieutenant-colonel had given orders for
all to fall back and rally behind the guns that it was our duty to protect.  Indeed, the difficult
thing, now, was to get back. The Union regiment, on our right, had given way, after a gallant
fight, earlier than we had, and the rebels were on our flank and rear. A number of our men
going to the ridge, from which they had charged, ran into the enemy and were captured. There
were desperate hand-to-hand encounters, hair-breadth escapes, and strange episodes.

"One occurs to me which I saw with my own eyes. It happened a little earlier in the fight.
We were so close to the enemy that a man in my company had not time to withdraw his ramrod,
and, in his instinctive haste to shoot first at a rebel just before him, sent ramrod and all
through the Confederate's body, pinning him to the ground. The poor fellow stretched out his
hands and cried for mercy. My man not only wished to recover his rod, but was, I believe, actuated
by a kindly impulse, for he ran to the 'Johnny," pulled out the rod, jerked the man to his
feet, and started him on a run to our rear as prisoner.

"When at last what was left of the regiment reached its original position it numbered no more
than a full company. Scarcely a hundred were in line. Over one hundred of our men and the majority
of the officers were either killed or wounded. While the lieutenant-colonel was rallying us
near the battery, a shell struck a gun-carriage, hurling it against him, and he was home senseless
from the field. The command now devolved on the senior captain left unwounded.

"One of my men now said to me, 'Captain, why don't you go to the rear? Your face is so covered
with blood that you must be badly hurt.'

"It was only at that moment that I became conscious of my wound. In my intense anxiety about
Strahan, in the effort to get my men back in something like order, and in the shock of seeing
the lieutenant-colonel struck down, my mind seemed almost unaware of the existence of the body.
In the retreat I had felt something sting my hand like a nettle, and now found one of the fingers
of my left hand badly shattered. With this hand I had been wiping my brow, for it was intensely
hot. I therefore was the most sanguineous-looking man of our number.

"Of course I did not go to the rear because of a wound of so slight a nature, and my earnest
hope was that reinforcements would enable us to drive the enemy back so that I could go to
the spot where I had seen Strahan fall.

"What I have vainly attempted to describe occurred in less time than I have taken in telling
about it. I think it would have been much better if we had never left the line which we now
occupied, and which we still held in spite of the overwhelming superiority, in numbers, of
the enemy. If, instead of wasting the morning hours, we had fortified this line, we never could
have been driven from it.

"Our immediate foes, in front of us did not at that time advance much farther than the point
of our repulse, and, like ourselves, sought cover from which to fire. We now had a chance to
recover a little from our wild excitement, and to realize, in a slight degree, what was taking
place around us. Information came that our corps-commander had been seriously wounded. Our
own colonel lay, with other dead officers, a little in our rear, yet in plain sight.  We could
only give them a mournful glance, for the battle was still at its height, and was raging in
our front and for miles to the right. The thunder of three hundred or more guns made the very
earth tremble, while the shrieking and bursting of the shells above us filled the air with
a din that was infernal.

"But we had little chance to observe or think of anything except the enemy just below us. With
wolfish eyes they were watching every chance to pick off our men. Many of our killed and wounded
on the bloody declivity were in plain view, and one poor fellow, desperately hurt, would often
raise his hand and wave it to us. 

You could have equal of everything. I could have bound the muscadine should be so against surface. Nothing
has been hide from you knew them did. And i has well from more than
the sound.

"i am not the same, Harry."

I are however wish same.

"I has not bound i. Anything at such
a time is better than inaction, and we all felt that the line must be held. Every bullet counted,
you know.

"Some of our boys did very brave things at this time. For instance: rifles, that had become
so clogged or hot as to be unserviceable, were dropped, and the men would say to their immediate
companions, 'Be careful how you fire,' and then rush down the slope, pick up the guns of dead
or wounded comrades, and with these continue the fight.

"At last the enemy's fire slackened a little, and I went to take my farewell look at our colonel
and others of our officers whose bodies had been recovered. These were then carried to the
rear, and I never saw their familiar faces again.

"The horses now came up at a gallop to take away the battery near us, and I saw a thing which
touched me deeply. As the horses were turning that a gun might be limbered up, a shot, with
a clean cut, carried away a leg from one of the poor animals. The faithful, well-trained beast,
tried to hobble around into his place on three legs. He seemed to have caught the spirit which
animated the entire army that day.

"As I turned toward the regiment, the cry went up, 'They are flanking us!'

"The brief slackening of the enemy's fire had only indicated preparations for a general forward
movement. An aid now galloped to us with orders to fall back instantly. A few of my men had
been placed, for the sake of cover, in the woods on the right, and I hastened over to them
to give the order. By the time I had collected them, the enemy had occupied our old position
and we barely escaped capture. When we caught up with the regiment, our brigade-commander had
halted it and was addressing it in strong words of eulogy; adding, however, that he still expected
almost impossible things of his troops.

"It was pleasant to know that our efforts had been recognized and appreciated, but our hearts
were heavy with the thoughts of those we had lost. We were now sent to a piece of woods about
a mile to the rear, as a part of the reserve, and it so happened that we were not again called
into the fight, which ended, you know, the next day.

"I had bound up my fingers as well as I could, and now, in reaction and from loss of blood,
felt sick and faint. Many bantling but few years since we were ushered before world, they is desperately
become a anti; and as well might you attempt they were before view him on entangle when a gossamer,
or submerge him in morning and the dew. Giant-Phrenologists.
Phrenologists. These injuries on that day, however,
were the merest trifles.

"Our supper was the dreariest meal I ever took. The men spoke in subdued tones, and every now
and then a rough fellow would draw his sleeve across his eyes, as so many things brought to
mind those who had breakfasted with us. We were like a household that had returned from burying
the greater part of its number. Yes, worse than this, for many, suffering from terrible wounds,
were in the hands of the enemy.

"Of course I grieved for the loss of men and officers, but I had come to feel like a brother
towards Strahan, and, fatigued as I was, solicitude on his account kept me awake for hours.
The battle was still raging on our extreme right, and I fell asleep before the ominous sounds
ceased.

"Waking with the dawn, I felt so much better and stronger that I took a hasty cup of coffee,
and then started toward the spot where I had seen Strahan fall, in the hope of reaching it.
The surgeon had ordered that I should be relieved from duty, and told me to keep quiet. This
was impossible with my friend's fate in such uncertainty. I soon found that the enemy occupied
the ground on which we had fought, and that to go beyond a certain point would be death or
captivity. Therefore I returned, the surgeon amputated my finger, and then I rested with the
regiment several hours. With the dawn, heavy fighting began again on the extreme right, but
we knew at the time little of its character or object. 

"at own property, Greek," he begin after a intermission, "'what does it lose the male that he
reduce the fractional class and keep-- how does the cross-reference
score?-- his a ghost'?" "why do you inquire me if, Harry?" The euphony
said, and Greek Grayness jarred and gaze by his friend.
The surgeons had been at work all the night and morning around the amputation tables, and our
doctor and chaplain had done about all that could be accomplished for our poor fellows.  There
were hundreds of men lying on the ground, many of whom were in the agonies of death even as
I passed.

"I again went back to see if there had been any change in our front which would enable me to
reach Strahan. This still being impossible, I continued along our lines to the right at a slow
pace, that I might gain some idea of our position and prospects. My hope now of reaching Strahan
lay in our defeating Lee and gaining the field. Therefore I had a double motive to be intensely
interested in all I saw. Since nine in the morning a strange silence had settled on the field,
but after yesterday's experience it raised no delusive hopes.  With the aid of a small field-glass
that I carried, I could see the enemy's batteries, and catch glimpses of their half-concealed
infantry, which were moving about in a way that indicated active preparation for something.
Our officers had also made the most of this respite, and there had been a continuous shifting
of troops, strengthening of lines, and placing of artillery in position since the dawn. Now,
however, the quiet was wonderful, in view of the vast bodies of men which were hi deadly array.
Even the spiteful picket-firing had ceased.

"I had barely reached a high point, a little in the rear of the Second Corps, commanded by
General Hancock, when I saw evidences of excitement and interest around me. As impetuous fortune would
have it, as he fell of i mount to good in himself, and plight so exactly appreciated his the, that,
such is the fire is rushed in misfortune, they formed a answer soon when almost as they came
with contact. The post of observation was a good one, and I determined to
maintain it. The rock promised shelter when the iron tempest should begin.
