     "The province of Tavoy has engaged in an open revolt against the
     British government. On Lord's day morning, the 9th inst. at 4
     o'clock, we were aroused from our quiet slumbers by the cry of
     'Teacher, master, Tavoy rebels,' and ringing at all our doors and
     windows. We were soon awake to our extreme danger, as we heard not
     only a continual report of musketry within the town, but the balls
     were frequently passing over our heads and through our house; and
     in a few moments, a large company of Tavoyans collected near our
     gate, and gave us reason to suspect they were consulting what to do
     with us. We lifted our hearts to God for protection, and Mrs.
     Boardman and little George were hurried away through a back door
     to a retired building in the rear. I lay down in the house, (to
     escape the bullets,) with a single Burman boy, to watch and
     communicate the first intelligence After an hour of the greatest
     anxiety and uncertainty I had the happiness of seeing the sepoys
     (troops in the British service) in possession of the city gates in
     front of our house. We soon ascertained that a party of about 250
     men had in the first instance attacked the powder magazine and
     gun-shed, which were very near our house, but a guard of sepoys had
     repelled them. This was a great mercy, for had the insurgents
     obtained the arms and ammunition, our situation would have been
     most deplorable. A second party of 60 had attacked the house of the
     principal native officer of the town, while a third party had
     fallen upon the guard of the prison, and let loose all the
     prisoners, one hundred in number, who, as soon as their irons were
     knocked off, became the most desperate of all the insurgents." ...

     The commissioner of the province was absent at Maulmain, but his
     lady, Mrs. Burney, urged their immediate removal to the government
     house. They hesitated at first, thinking the rebellion might soon
     be quelled; but hearing from a rebel prisoner that the whole
     province was engaged in the insurrection, and that large
     reinforcements might be hourly expected to join the rebels, and
     finding that the Mission premises from their situation, were likely
     to be the very battleground of the contending parties,--after
     seeking Divine direction, they concluded to abandon them. He
     continues his narrative, "We caught up a few light articles on
     which we could lay our hands, and with the native Christians, fled
     as if for our lives. I visited the house once or twice after this,
     and saved a few clothes and papers, but the firing being near,
     rendered it hazardous to remain, and the last time I went, I found
     the house had been plundered. A large part of our books, furniture
     and clothes, which had remained behind were either taken away or
     destroyed.

     "We had been at the government house but a short time, when it was
     agreed to evacuate the town and retire to the wharf. In the hurry
     of our second removal, many things which we had brought from our
     house, were necessarily left, to fall into the hands of the
     plunderers. We soon found ourselves at the wharf,--a large wooden
     building of six rooms, into which, besides the Europeans, were
     huddled all the sepoys with their baggage and ours, and several
     hundreds of women and children belonging to Portuguese and others,
     who looked to the English for protection. Our greatest danger at
     this time arose from having in one of the rooms where many were to
     sleep, and all of us were continually passing, several hundred
     barrels of gunpowder, to which if fire should be communicated
     accidentally by ourselves, or mischievously by others, we should
     all perish at once. The next danger was from the rebels, who if
     they could either rush upon us, or take us by surprise or
     stratagem, would doubtless massacre us all on the spot. We lifted
     up our hearts to God, and he heard us from his holy habitation. We
     were preserved in safety through the night, though anxious and
     sleepless. All our attempts to communicate intelligence of our
     situation to the people in Maulmain and Mergui were defeated, and
     the heavy rains soon affected the health of the sepoys. We had but
     a small supply of rice in the granary near the wharf, and that was
     continually in danger of being destroyed or burnt. But through the
     kind care of our Heavenly Father, we were preserved alive, and
     nothing of great importance occurred until the morning of Thursday,
     a little before day-break, when a party of 500 advanced upon us
     from the town, and set fire to several houses and vessels near the
     wharf. But God interposed in our behalf, and sent a heavy shower of
     rain, which extinguished the fire while the sepoys repelled the
     assailants.

     "At breakfast the same morning we had the happiness of seeing the
     Diana steam-vessel coming up the river, with Major Burney on board.
     Our hearts bounded with gratitude to God. It was soon agreed that
     the Diana should return immediately to Maulmain for a reinforcement
     of troops, and Major Burney had the kindness to offer a passage for
     Mrs. Boardman and our family together with his own. After looking
     to God for direction, I concluded to remain behind, partly in
     compliance with Major Burney's advice and desire, but particularly
     in the hope of being useful as an interpreter and negotiator, and a
     preventer of bloodshed. With painful pleasure I took a hasty leave
     of my dear family, and in the evening the Diana left us, not
     however without having several shots from cannon or jinjals fired
     at her from the people on the city wall. The English forces, small
     and weak and sick as they were, were now throwing up breast-works;
     and on Saturday the 15th inst. it was agreed to make an attack on
     the town, in order if possible to take from the walls the large
     guns that bore upon us, and to try the strength of the rebel party.
     I stood at the post of observation with a spy-glass to watch and
     give the earliest notice of the event, and soon had the pleasure of
     announcing that the officers and sepoys had scaled the walls, and
     were pitching down outside the large guns, that were mounted there,
     while friendly Chinese were employed in carrying them to the wharf.
     The success was complete, and nothing remained but to rescue the
     prisoners (60 in number) whom the rebels had caught and confined.
     After a short cessation and a little refreshment, a second attack
     was made, during which the prisoners escaped and the rebels
     evacuated the city. A second battery of guns was also taken and
     brought to the wharf. In the morning we walked at large through the
     town; but what desolation, what barbarous destruction was
     everywhere exhibited! everything that could not be carried away had
     been cut and destroyed in the most wanton manner. Our own house was
     cut to pieces, our books cut scattered, torn and destroyed; our
     furniture either carried off, or cut, or broken in pieces, and the
     house itself and zayat converted into cook-houses and barracks.
     During the last three days, we have been picking up the scattered
     fragments of our furniture, books, &c. and repairing our house.

     "Nga-Dah, the ringleader of the rebellion, and eleven of his
     principal adherents, have been caught. The inhabitants are coming
     in with white flags and occupying their houses. The bazaar is open,
     and the work of repairs is going on.

     "Yesterday morning the Diana arrived with a reinforcement of
     European soldiers; and to-day I have come on board, expecting to
     proceed to Maulmain immediately. My present plan is, if my brethren
     approve, to return with my family, and resume our missionary labors
     as before. The native members of our church, now scattered, will
     probably come into town as soon as they hear of our return. Have her were

    "Perchance her reason stoops, or reels;
    Perchance a courage not her own
    Braces her mind to desperate tone,"

Yes, her mind was stayed by a "courage not her own," but it was "braced" to no "desperate tone;"
rather its calmness was that of a child, who, in its own utter helplessness, clings to its
father's arm, and feels secure. Neither must we forget that a painful diversion of her thoughts
from the terrors around her, was afforded by the necessities of her suffering babe, to whom
the foul air of the wharf-house, and the want of all comforts, had nearly proved fatal. It
was only her sleepless, vigilant care, that, under Providence, prevented the poor child from
sharing the fate of Mrs. Burney's little infant, which did not survive the dreadful scene.

And with what transports of joy did this suffering company hail the sight of the thin blue
smoke that heralded the arrival of a steamer from Maulmain! Amid what distracting fears for
her husband, left in the revolted city, her infant and herself, did Mrs. Boardman decide to
go on board the steamer returning to Maulmain! And with what gratitude and joy did she, after
several days of painful suspense, welcome to the same city, her husband, and hear the tidings
of the triumph of British power, and the restoration of tranquillity! In her happiness at meeting
him alive, she noticed not that his late exposure and sufferings had increased to an alarming
degree the symptoms of his dreadful malady. Inspired with something of his own enthusiasm,
she saw him depart, to return to his beloved labors in Tavoy, whither she hoped and expected
soon to follow him. In the meantime Mrs. Boardman continued at Maulmain, part of the time suffering
from illness, and when able, assisting the missionaries there, until October, when she returned
again to Tavoy. On completion, the concrete portions were become over the contractor for the cross-attic

their relative positions. But careless as he
was of his own bodily ease, there was an eye that watched him with the intensest solicitude;
a heart that was pierced with anxiety, knowing that though "the inner man was renewed day by
day," the outer man was too surely "perishing," and would soon be laid aside, forever.

On the 29th of July, 1830, Mrs. Boardman writes to her sister from Maulmain, whither they had
gone for the benefit of her children's health: "We must look beyond this frail fleeting world
for our true peace. Alas, I know by most bitter experience, that it is in vain to seek for
true happiness here below. Of the catholic hand, part, which stands in Welles hundred, but held
family hangs on the parish to Boyatt of Twyford, was in the retainers from the numerous roman
Brambridge in Highbridge, who seem of have had other hands at Otterbourne,
Allbrook, and Boyatt. But a darker cloud hangs over me. Oh what desolation and anguish of spirit do I feel,
when I think it is possible that in a few more months, my earthly guide, supporter, and delight,
may be no more!... He has a cough which has been hanging about him a year, and he is very much
