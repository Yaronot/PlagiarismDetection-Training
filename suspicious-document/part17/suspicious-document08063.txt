Lay long, being a bitter, cold, frosty day, the frost being now grown old, and the Thames covered
with ice.  Up, and to the office, where all the morning busy.  At noon to the 'Change a little,
where Mr. James Houblon and I walked a good while speaking of our ill condition in not being
able to set out a fleet (we doubt) this year, and the certain ill effect that must bring, which
is lamentable.  Home to dinner, where the best powdered goose that ever I eat.  Then to the
office again, and to Sir W. Batten's to examine the Commission going down to Portsmouth to
examine witnesses about our prizes, of which God give a good issue! and then to the office
again, where late, and so home, my eyes sore.  To supper and to bed.

2nd.  Up, I, and walked to White Hall to attend the Duke of York, as usual.  God have mercy
on us! for we can send forth no ships without men, nor will men go without money, every day
bringing us news of new mutinies among the seamen; so that our condition is like to be very
miserable.  Thence to Westminster Hall, and there met all the Houblons, who do laugh at this
discourse of the French, and say they are verily of opinion it is nothing but to send to their
plantation in the West Indys, and that we at Court do blow up a design of invading us, only
to make the Parliament make more haste in the money matters, and perhaps it may be so, but
I do not believe we have any such plot in our heads. There are so. Part who did not be done is to do

  Then
all withdrew, and by and by the Council rose, and I spoke with the Duke of York, and he told
me my business was done, which I found accordingly in Sir Edward Walker's books.  And so away,
mightily satisfied, to Arundell House, and there heard a little good discourse, and so home,
and there to Sir W. Batten, where I heard the examinations in two of our prizes, which do make
but little for us, so that I do begin to doubt their proving prize, which troubled me.  So
home to supper with my wife, and after supper my wife told me how she had moved to W. Hewer
the business of my sister for a wife to him, which he received with mighty acknowledgements,
as she says, above anything; but says he hath no intention to alter his condition: so that
I am in some measure sorry she ever moved it; but I hope he will think it only come from her.
So after supper a little to the office, to enter my journall, and then home to bed.  The children
at this day are provided for in the country by the House, which I am glad also to hear.

18th.  Up, and most of the morning finishing my entry of my journall
during the late fire out of loose papers into this book, which did please
me mightily when done, I, writing till my eyes were almost blind therewith
to make an end of it.  Then all the rest of the morning, and, after a
mouthful of dinner, all the afternoon in my closet till night, sorting all
my papers, which have lain unsorted for all the time we were at Greenwich
during the plague, which did please me also, I drawing on to put my office
into a good posture, though much is behind.  This
morning, also, there come to the office a letter from the Duke of York,
commanding our payment of no wages to any of the muster-masters of the
fleete the last year, but only two, my brother Balty, taking notice that
he had taken pains therein, and one Ward, who, though he had not taken so
much as the other, yet had done more than the rest.  This I was exceeding
glad of for my own sake and his.  At night I, by appointment, home, where
