Juist at this meenit Sandy got grips o' the railin' o' the stair, an' him an' me got ane anither
trailed up some wey or ither.  Gin I got on the paidmint, I was slippin' here an' there like
some lassie on the skeetchin' pond, till doon I skaikit, skloit on the braid o' my back, an'
left my life-size engravin' i' the middle o' the road.  Eh, it was a gude thing I didna hae
on my best frock!  I shiftit at tea-time, for thae gutters mak' sic a dreedfu' mairter o' a body.

"It's a black, burnin' shame," says Sandy, as he gaithered me up; "an' I howp some o' thae
Lichtin' Commitee chappies 'ill get a dook amon' the gutters the nicht for this pliskie o'
theirs.  It's a fine nicht fort.  Fowk peyin' nae end o' rates, an' a' the streets as dark
as a cell--a sell it is, an' nae mistak'.  Feech!  I tell ye, what it is an' what it's no',
Bawbie----"

"Wheesht, Sandy," says I.  "Keep me, if ye go on rantin' like that, the fowk 'ill think ye've
startit the street preachin'.  Haud your lang tongue.  I'm no' michty muckle the waur."

Sandy took oot his tnife an' gae me a bit skrape; an' we landit at the kirk an' got a rale
gude sermon aboot the birkie 'at belanged to Simaria an' fell on his road hame, an' so on.
I wasna muckle the waur o't efter a'--o' the fa', I mean, of coorse, no' the sermon--an', when
we got hame, I got aff my goon; an' tho' Sandy gae the Lichtin' Commitee an' the gutter-raikers
a gey haf-'oor's throo the mill, I didna think muckle mair aboot it.

But, as I was sayin', this was a' leadin' up to something.  Sandy cudna sit still at nicht,
an' he sang an' smokit till, atween bein' deaved an' scumfished, I was nearhand seek.  Efter
readin' oor chapter, I gaed awa' to my bed.  I lookit up twa-three times an' saw Sandy sittin'
afore the fire, twirlin' his thooms, an' gien a bit whistle noo an' than.  Efter a while he
put oot the gas, an' syne began to tak' aff his claes, an' wide aboot amon' the furniture as
uswal.  He got intil his bed efter a quarter o' an oor's miscellaneous scramblin', an' was
sune snorin' like a dragoon.

When I got atower i' the mornin', what is there sittin' on my chair but a great muckle shortie
in a braw box, wi' a Christmas caird on the tap o't.  When I opened the box here's ane o' my
stockin's lyin' on the tap o' a great big cake, juist like this:--

      To
   B. BOWDEN
    from a
    F IEND

I lookit anower at Sandy, an' here's him lyin' wi' a look on his face like's he was wantin'
on the Parochial Buird.

"Eh, Sandy!  What a man you are!" I says, says I; for, mind you, I was a richt prood woman
on Munanday mornin'.

"It was Sandy Claws, 'oman," says he, lauchin'.  "He cudna get the box into your stockin',
so he juist put your stockin' into the box.  But it's juist sax an' half a dizzen, I suppose."

I hude up the cake to the licht, an' read oot the braw white sugar letters--"'To B. Bowden
from a Fiend.'  But wha's the fiend, Sandy?" says I, I says.

"Fiend!" roared Sandy, jumpin' ooten his bed.  "Lat's see't."

He glowered at the cake like's he was tryin' to mismerise somebody; an' then he says, "See
a haud o' my troosers there, Bawbie.  I'll go doon an' pet that baker through his mixin' machine.
I'll lat him see what kind o' a fiend I am.  I'll fiend him."

"Hover a blink, Sandy," says I.  "Here's ane o' the letters stickin' to my stokin'."  Shure
eneuch, here was a great big "R" stickin' to the ribs o' my stockin'; so I juist took a lickie
glue an' stak her on the cake, an' made it read a' richt.  Sandy was rale pleased when he saw
me so big aboot my cake; an' he's been trailin' in aboot a' the neepers to see "the wife's
cake," as he ca's't.  An' he stands wi' his thooms i' the oxter holes o' his weyscot, an' lauchs,
an' says, "Tyuch; naething ava; no wirth speakin' aboot," when I tell them hoo big I am aboot it.

She's genna be broken on Munanday--Nooeer's-day.  If you're pasain' oor wey, look in an' get
a crummie.  I'll be richt gled to see you, I'm shure.  A happy noo 'ear to you, when it comes--an'
mony may ye see! Ah-hy!  Gude-day wi' ye i' the noo than!  Imphm!  Gude-day.  See an' gie's
a cry in on Munanday, noo-na.  Ta-ta!

XVII.

AT THE SELECT CHOIR'S CONCERT.

Sin' Friday nicht I've been gaen aboot wi' my hert an' moo fu' o' musik!  Eh, hoo I did enjoy
yon Gleeka Koir's singin'.  I hinna heard onything like it for mony a day.  D'ye ken, fine
musik juist affeks me like a gude preechin'--an' waur whiles.  I canna help frae thinkin' aboot
it.  The tune I've been hearin' 'ill come into my heid at a' times; an' here I'll be maybe
croonin' awa' i' the shop to mysel' "Will ye no' come back again?" an' gien somebody mustard
instead o' peysmeal, an', of coorse, it comes back again, an' a gey wey o' doin' wi't, an'
nae mistak'.

But, eh, I enjoyed the Burns Club concert!  Sandy an' me was doon at the hall on the back o'
seven o'clock, an' we got set doon at the end o' ane o' the farrest-forrit sixpenny seats,
an' got a lean on the back o' ane o' the shilliny anes.  We was gey gled we gaed doon early,
for the hall was foo juist in a clap; an' gin aucht o'clock, Sandy tells me, they were offerin'
half-a-croon to get their lug to the keyhole. It was an awfu' crush.

There was a gey pompis-like carlie cam' an' tried to birz Sandy an' me up the seat; but Sandy
sune made a job o' him.

"Have you a ticket?" says Sandy.

"Ay, have I," says the carlie, curlin' up his lips gey snappish-like; "I have a three-shillin'
ticket."

"Ay, weel, awa' oot o' this," says Sandy.  "This is the sikey seats, an' we dinna want ony
o' you chappies poachin' amon' his lads.  If you've only a three-shilliny ticket, you'll awa'
oot o' this, gey smert," says Sandy; an' a lot o' the fowk backit him up, an' faigs, mind ye,
the carlie had to crawl awa' forrit again, whaur he cam' frae. The cheek o' the cratur!  Thocht,
mind ye, he wud get crushed in amon' his sikey fowk wi' his three-shilliny ticket!

Whenever the singin' began ye wudda heard a preen fa'.  "There was a lad was born in Kyle,"
juist nearhand garred Sandy jump aff his seat. He cud hardly keep his feet still, an' he noddit
his heid frae side to side, an' leuch, like's he was some noo-married king drivin' awa' throo
the streets o' London till his honeymune.  Syne at "My luve she's like a reed, reed rose,"
he smakit his lips, an' turned his een up to the ruif, an' lookit to me twa-three times like's
he was genna tak' a dwam o' some kind.  That used to be a favourite sang o' Pecker Donnit's
when he precentit up at Dimbarrow.  Eh, mony's the time I've heard him at it.  Ye'll mind fine
o' the Peeker?  He bade ower i' yon cottar hoose, wast a bittie frae the Whin Inn.  He had
twa dochters, ye'll mind, an' a he-cat that killed whitterits wi' a blind e'e.  Eh, ay; that's
mony a lang day syne!  But I'm awa' frae my story.

I cudna tell ye which o' the bits I likeit best.  I juist sat nearhand a' nicht fairly entranced.
I thocht yon twa kimmers that sang "The Banks an' Braes o' Bonnie Boon" did awfu' pritty. 
Raley, my hert was i' my moo twa-three times when they were at the bitties whaur they sang
laich, juist like the sooch-soochin' o' the hairst wind i' the forenicht amon' the stocks.
Sandy was sweengin' aboot in his seat, like's he was learnin' the velocipede, an' takin' a
lang breath ilky noo-an'-than, an' sayin', "Imphm; ay, man; juist that."  He riffed when the
lassies sat doon, till ye wud thocht he wudda haen his hands blistered; but I think he was
gled o' onything to do, juist to lat him get himsel' gien vent.

When the koir startit to sing aboot Willie Wastle, Sandy nickered awa' like a noo-spain'd foal,
an' aye when they cam' to the henmist line o' the verse he gae me a prog i' the ribs wi' his
elba, as much as to say, "That's ane for you, Bawbie!"  But I watched him, an' at the henmist
verse, when they said terriple quick, "I wudna gie a button for her," I juist edged alang a
bittie, an' Sandy's elba missin', he juist exakly landit pargeddis in a fisherwife's lap that
was sittin' ahent's.  There was plenty o' lauchin' an' clappin' whaur we was, I can tell ye.

I likeit "Scots wha hae," an' the "Macgregor's Gaitherin'."  I thocht yon was juist grand.
When they were singin' "Scots wha hae," Sandy glowered a' roond aboot him like's he wudda likeit
to ken if onybody wantit a fecht.  What a soond there was at the strong bits.  The feint a
ane o' me kens whaur yon men an' weemin' get a' yon soond.  At some o' the lines o' the "Macgregor's
Gaitherin'" it was like the wind thunderin' doon Glen Tanner, or the Rooshyan guns at Sebastypool.
I cudna help frae notisin' hoo it garred a'body sit straucht up.  When yon lassie was singin'
sae bonnie, "John Anderson, my Jo," a' the fowk's heids were hingin'; but at "Scots wha hae"
they sat up like life gairds, and ilky body near me lookit like's it wudna be cannie speakin'
to them.

There was ae thing they sang that wasna on the programme that I thocht awfu' muckle o'.  It
was something aboot "Tramp!  Tramp!  Tramp!"  Ane o' the lassies sang a bit hersel' here an'
there, an' eh, what splendid it was.  She gaed up an' doon amon' the notes juist like forkit
lichtnin', an her voice rang oot as clear as a bell.  It was raley something terriple pritty.
When she feenished ye wudda thocht the fowk was genna ding doon the hoose.  "Man, that raley
snecks a' green thing; it fair cowps the cairt ower onything ever I heard," says Sandy, gien
his nose a dicht wi' the back o' his hand.  "That dame has raley a grand pipe; ye wud winder
whaur she fand room for a' the wind she maun need."  A foll curn fowk startit to the lauchin'
when Sandy said this; but, faigs, mind ye, the lassie fairly astonished me.

When the votes o' thanks were gien oot, Sandy riffed an' rattled oot o' a' measure.  I thocht
ance or twice he wud be up to the pletform to say a wird or twa himsel', he was that excited.
Syne when "Auld Lang Syne" was mentioned, he sprang till his feet, evened his gravat, pulled
doon his weyscot, put a' the buttons intil his coat, an' swallowed a spittal.  An' hoo he tootit
an' sang!  I thocht the precentor that was beatin' time lookit across at him twa-three times,
he was roostin' an' roarin' at sic a rate.  He sang at the pitch o' his voice--

  Shud auld acquantance be forgot,
    An' never brocht to mind,

an' syne gien me a great daud on the shuder wi' his elba, he says, "Sing quicker, Bawbie"--

  For the days o' auld langsyne.

There was a fisher ahent's that strak' in wi' the chorus an' made an' awfu' gutter o't.  He
yalpit awa' a' on ae note, juist like's he was roarin' to somebody to lowse the penter; an'
though Sandy keepit gaen, he was in a richt raise.

"That roarin' nowt's juist makin' a pure soss o't," he says, when we finished.  "Ye wud easy
ken he had learned his singin' at the sea"; an' he glowered roond at him gey ill-natir'd like,
an' says, "Haud your tung, ye roarin' cuif."  Syne he grippit the fisher's hand wi' ane o'
his, an' mine wi' the ither, an' startit--

  An' here's a hand, my trusty fraend, eksettera.

The fisher lookit gey dumfoondered like, an' never lut anither peek; but Sandy stack in like
a larry-horse till the feenish, an' he cam' hame a' the road sayin', "Man, that's raley been
a treat!"

It was that, an' nae mistak', an' as the chairman said, it'll be a memorable concert to mony a ane.

XVIII.

SANDY RUNS A RACE.

Weel, I'll tell ye what it is, an' what it's no'--I thocht the ither nicht that Sandy had gotten
to the far end o' his ongaens.  If ever a woman thocht she was genna hae to don her weeda's
weeds, it was me.  I never expeckit to see Sandy again, till he was brocht in on the police
streetchin' buird.  But I'll better begin my story at the beginnin'. What needs I care whuther
fowk kens a' aboot it, or no'?  I've been black affrontit that often, I dinna care a doaken
noo what happens. I've dune my best to be a faithfu' wife; an' I'm shure I've trauchled awa'
an' putten up wi' a man that ony ither woman wudda pushon'd twenty 'ear syne!  But that's nether
here nor there.

Weel, to get to my story.  Aboot a week syne I was busy at the back door, hingin' oot some
bits o' things, an', hearin' some din i' the back shop, I took a bit glint in at the winda.
Fancy my surprise, when here's Sandy i' the middle o' the flure garrin' his airms an' legs
flee like the shakers o' Robbie Smith's "deevil."

"What i' the earth is he up till noo?" says I to mysel'.  He stoppit efter a whilie, an' syne
my lad quietly tnaks twa raw eggs on the edge o' a cup, an' doon his thrapple wi' them.  He
brook up the shalls into little bitties an' steered them in amon' the ase, so's I wudna see
them.  Atower to the middle o' the flure he comes again, an', stridin' his legs oot, he began
to garr first the tae airm an' syne the tither gae whirlin' roond an' roond like the fly wheel
o' an engine.  It mindit me o' the schule laddies an' their bummers.  Weel, than; I goes my
wa's into the hoose.

"Ay, it's a fine thing an egg, Sandy," says I; "especially twa."  I turned roond to the dresser-heid,
no' to lat him see me lauchin'--for I cudna keep it in--an' pretendit to be lookin' for something.

"It is so, Bawbie," says he; an' I noticed him i' the lookin'-gless pettin' his thoom till
his nose.  I whiskit roond aboot gey quick, an' he drappit his hands like lichtnin', an' began
whistlin' "Tillygorm."

"I've heard it said," says I, "that a raw egg's gude for a yooky nose."

"You're aye hearin' some blethers," says he; "but there's Robbie Mershell i' the shop"; an'
but he ran to sair him.

I kent fine there was something up, so I keepit my lugs an' een open, but it beat me to get
at the boddom o't.  Pottie Lawson, Bandy Wobster, an' Sandy have juist been thick an' three
faud sin the Hielant games toornament, an' I kent fine there was some pliskie brooin' amon'
them. They've hardly ever been oot o' the washin'-hoose, them an' twa-three mair.  Great, muckle,
hingin'-aboot, ill-faured scoonges, every ane o' them!  I tell ye, Sandy hasna dune a hand's
turn for the lest week, but haikit aboot wi' them, plesterin' aboot this thing an' that.  Feech!
If I was a man, as I'm a woman, I wud kick the whole box an' dice o' them oot the entry.

I gaed by the washin'-hoose door twa-three times, an' heard the spittin', an' the ochin' an'
ayin', an' some bletherin' aboot sprentin', an' rubbin' doon, an' sic like; but I cud mak'
nether heid nor tail o't.  But, I can tell ye, baith heid an' tail o't cam' oot on Setarday nicht.

Sandy, as uswal, put on his goshores on Setarday efternune, an' awa' he gaed aboot five o'clock,
an' I saw nae mair o' him till the lang legs o' him----  But you'll learn aboot that sune eneuch.
It was a sicht, the first sicht I got o' him, I can tell you.

I was takin' a bit cuppie o' tea to mysel' aboot seven o'clock, for I had been terriple busy
a' forenicht.  Nathan was stanin' at the table as uswal, growk-growkin' awa' for a bit o' my
tea biskit.  "I dinna like growkin' bairns," I says to Nathan, juist as I was genna gie him
a bit piece an' some noo grozer jeel on't.

"I'm no' carin'," he says, blawin' his nose atween his finger an' his thoom, an' syne dichtin't
wi' his bonnet.  "I wasna growkin'; but at ony rate I'll no tell ye aboot Sandy.  He said he
wud gie me a letherin' if I was a clash-pie; but I was juist genna tell you, but I'll no' do't
noo," an' oot at the door he gaed.  I cried on him to come back, but, yea wud!

I saw nae mair o' him for half an 'oor, when in he comes to the back shop wi' a bundle o' claes
an' flang them i' the flure.  "There's Sandy's claes," says he.  "I got them frae Bandy Wobster
at the tap o' the street.  He got them lyin' oot the Sands, an' he disna ken naething aboot Sandy."

"O, Alick Bowden," I says to mysel', says I; "I kent this would be the end o't some day!  He's
gane awa' dookin' an' gotten himsel' drooned. O, my puir man!  I howp they'll get his body,
or never anither bit o' fish will I eat!  There's Mistress Mertin fand a galace button in a
red-waur codlin's guts lest week; an' it's no' so very lang syne sin' Mistress Kenawee got
fower bits o' skellie i' the crap o' a colomy. Puir Sandy!  I winder hoo they'll do wi' the
bural society bawbees?"

"Is Sandy deid, Bawbie?" says Nathan.

"Ay; I doot he's deid, Nathan, laddie," says I.

"An' will you lat me get a ride on the dickie at the bural, Bawbie?" says Nathan, clawin' his
heid throo a hole in his glengairy.

"Haud your tongue, laddie," says I; "ye dinna ken what you're speakin' aboot."

I gaithered up the claes.  There was nae mistakin' them.  They were Sandy's!  The breeks pooches
were foo o' nails an' strings, an' as muckle ither rubbish as you wudda gotten in Peattie Broon's,
the pigman's, back shop.  There was a lot o' fiddle rozit i' the weyscot, an' a box o' queer-lookin'
ointment ca'd auntie stuff.  But what strack me first was that his seamit an' his drawers werena
there.  "Cud he gane in dookin' wi' them on?" thocht I to mysel'.  I cudna see throo't ava.

I gaed awa' to the shop door juist to look oot, an' I sees Pottie Lawson, Bandy Wobster, an'
twa-three mair at the tap o' the street lauchin' like ony thing.  I throo the key i' the door
in a blink, an' up the street I goes.  Pottie was juist in the middle o' a great hallach o'
a lauch, when I grippit him by the collar.  He swallowed the rest o' his lauch, I can tell you.

"What hae ye dune till my man, ye nesty, clorty, ill-lookin', mischeevious footer?" I says,
giein' him a shak' that garred him turn up the white o' his een.

"Tak' your hand off me, you ill-tongued bissam," saya he, "or I'll lay your feet fest for you."

"Will you?" says I; an' I gae him a shuve that kowpit him heels-ower-heid ower the tap o' Gairner
Winton's ae-wheeled barrow, that was sittin' ahent him.  When he got himsel' gaithered oot
amon' the peycods an' cabbitch, he was genna be at me, but Dauvid Kenawee stappit forrit, an'
says he, "Saira ye richt, ye gude-for-naething snipe 'at ye are.  Lift a hand till her, an'
I'll ca' the chafts o' ye by ither."

"What bisness hae you shuvin' your nose in?" says Pottie Lawson. "There was naebody middlin'
wi' you."

"Juist you keep your moo steekit, Pottie," says Dauvid, "or I'll mibby be middlin' wi' you.
You're a miserable pack o' vagues, a' the lot o' ye, to gae wa' an' tak' advantage o' an' auld
man!  Yah!  Damish your skins, I cud thrash the whole pack o' ye."  He up wi' his niv an' took
a hawp forrit.  Pottie gaed apung ower the barrow again, an' sat doon on the tap o' the Gairner,
wha was busy gaitherin' up his gudes.

"Come awa', Bawbie," says Dauvid, takin' a haud o' my airm, "Sandy 'ill turn up yet."  So awa'
we gaed, leavin' the fower or five o' them wammlin' awa' amon' the cabbitch, juist like what
swine generally do when they get in amon' a gairner's stocks.

"Sandy's a fulish man," said Dauvid, when we landit at the shop door.

"Ye micht as weel tell me that twice twa's fower, Dauvid," says I. "Fulish is no' the wird for't."
