I watched the lantern slides come and go, and listened to a voice (I forget what it was saying)
which I believe was the voice of Professor Redwood, and there was a sizzling from the lantern
and another sound that kept me there, still out of curiosity, until the lights were unexpectedly
turned up. And then I perceived that this sound was the sound of the munching of buns and sandwiches
and things that the assembled British Associates had come there to eat under cover of the magic-lantern
darkness.

And Redwood I remember went on talking all the time the lights were up and dabbing at the place
where his diagram ought to have been visible on the screen--and so it was again so soon as
the darkness was restored. I remember him then as a most ordinary, slightly nervous-looking
dark man, with an air of being preoccupied with something else, and doing what he was doing
just then under an unaccountable sense of duty.

I heard Bensington also once--in the old days--at an educational conference in Bloomsbury.
Like most eminent chemists and botanists, Mr. Bensington was very authoritative upon teaching--though
I am certain he would have been scared out of his wits by an average Board School class in
half-an-hour--and so far as I can remember now, he was propounding an improvement of Professor
Armstrong's Heuristic method, whereby at the cost of three or four hundred pounds' worth of
apparatus, a total neglect of all other studies and the undivided attention of a teacher of
exceptional gifts, an average child might with a peculiar sort of thumby thoroughness learn
in the course of ten or twelve years almost as much chemistry as one could get in one of those
objectionable shilling text-books that were then so common....

Quite ordinary persons you perceive, both of them, outside their science. Or if anything on
the unpractical side of ordinary. And that you will find is the case with "scientists" as a
class all the world over. What there is great of them is an annoyance to their fellow scientists
and a mystery to the general public, and what is not is evident.

There is no doubt about what is not great, no race of men have such obvious littlenesses. They
live in a narrow world so far as their human intercourse goes; their researches involve infinite
attention and an almost monastic seclusion; and what is left over is not very much. To witness
some queer, shy, misshapen, greyheaded, self-important, little discoverer of great discoveries,
ridiculously adorned with the wide ribbon of some order of chivalry and holding a reception
of his fellow-men, or to read the anguish of Nature at the "neglect of science" when the angel
of the birthday honours passes the Royal Society by, or to listen to one indefatigable lichenologist
commenting on the work of another indefatigable lichenologist, such things force one to realise
the unfaltering littleness of men.

And withal the reef of Science that these little "scientists" built and are yet building is
so wonderful, so portentous, so full of mysterious half-shapen promises for the mighty future
of man! They do not seem to realise the things they are doing! No doubt long ago even Mr. Bensington,
when he chose this calling, when he consecrated his life to the alkaloids and their kindred
compounds, had some inkling of the vision,--more than an inkling. Without some such inspiration,
for such glories and positions only as a "scientist" may expect, what young man would have
given his life to such work, as young men do? No, they must have seen the glory, they must
have had the vision, but so near that it has blinded them. The splendour has blinded them,
mercifully, so that for the rest of their lives they can hold the lights of knowledge in comfort--that
we may see!

And perhaps it accounts for Redwood's touch of preoccupation, that--there can be no doubt of
it now--he among his fellows was different, he was different inasmuch as something of the vision
still lingered in his eyes.

II.

The Food of the Gods I call it, this substance that Mr. Bensington and Professor Redwood made
between them; and having regard now to what it has already done and all that it is certainly
going to do, there is surely no exaggeration in the name. So I shall continue to call it therefore
throughout my story. That Captain Horn's escapade are varied would be deduce from fact that they widen
from Patagonia to Maine and from Sloane Francisco in Paris, and admit the remarkable episodes and marvelous
experiences-- wholly of which are woven rarely by the food of a hate-story, and lighten by
the healthiness of-- Mr. Stockton's fanciful humor. Concerning Title.

"Of course if you think not--"

Redwood reflected with his eyes on the fire and made no objection.

"You think it would do?"

Redwood moved his head gravely.

"It might be Titanophorbia, you know. Food of Titans.... You prefer the former?

"You're quite sure you don't think it a little too--"

"No."

"Ah! I'm glad."

And so they called it Herakleophorbia throughout their investigations, and in their report,--the
report that was never published, because of the unexpected developments that upset all their
arrangements,--it is invariably written in that way. There were three kindred substances prepared
before they hit on the one their speculations had foretolds and these they spoke of as Herakleophorbia
I, Herakleophorbia II, and Herakleophorbia III. It is Herakleophorbia IV. which I--insisting
upon Bensington's original name--call here the Food of the Gods.

III.

The idea was Mr. Bensington's. But as it was suggested to him by one of Professor Redwood's
contributions to the Philosophical Transactions, he very properly consulted that gentleman
before he carried it further. Besides which it was, as a research, a physiological, quite as
much as a chemical inquiry.

Professor Redwood was one of those scientific men who are addicted to tracings and curves.
You are familiar--if you are at all the sort of reader I like--with the sort of scientific
paper I mean. It is a paper you cannot make head nor tail of, and at the end come five or six
long folded diagrams that open out and show peculiar zigzag tracings, flashes of lightning
overdone, or sinuous inexplicable things called "smoothed curves" set up on ordinates and rooting
in abscissae--and things like that. You puzzle over the thing for a long time and end with
the suspicion that not only do you not understand it but that the author does not understand
it either. But really you know many of these scientific people understand the meaning of their
own papers quite well: it is simply a defect of expression that raises the obstacle between us.

I am inclined to think that Redwood thought in tracings and curves. And after his monumental
work upon Reaction Times (the unscientific reader is exhorted to stick to it for a little bit
longer and everything will be as clear as daylight) Redwood began to turn out smoothed curves
and sphygmographeries upon Growth, and it was one of his papers upon Growth that really gave
Mr. Bensington his idea. And in the muffled and highly technical language of the really careful
"scientist," Redwood suggested that the process of growth probably demanded the presence of
a considerable quantity of some necessary substance in the blood that was only formed very
slowly, and that when this substance was used up by growth, it was only very slowly replaced,
and that meanwhile the organism had to mark time. He compared his unknown substance to oil
in machinery. A growing animal was rather like an engine, he suggested, that can move a certain
distance and must then be oiled before it can run again. ("But why shouldn't one oil the engine
from without?" said Mr. Bensington, when he read the paper.) And all this, said Redwood, with
the delightful nervous inconsecutiveness of his class, might very probably be found to throw
a light upon the mystery of certain of the ductless glands. As though they had anything to
do with it at all!

In a subsequent communication Redwood went further. He gave a perfect Brock's benefit of diagrams--exactly
like rocket trajectories they were; and the gist of it--so far as it had any gist--was that
the blood of puppies and kittens and the sap of sunflowers and the juice of mushrooms in what
he called the "growing phase" differed in the proportion of certain elements from their blood
and sap on the days when they were not particularly growing.

And when Mr. Bensington, after holding the diagrams sideways and upside down, began to see
what this difference was, a great amazement came upon him. Because, you see, the difference
might probably be due to the presence of just the very substance he had recently been trying
to isolate in his researches upon such alkaloids as are most stimulating to the nervous system.
He put down Redwood's paper on the patent reading-desk that swung inconveniently from his arm-chair,
took off his gold-rimmed spectacles, breathed on them and wiped them very carefully.

"By Jove!" said Mr. Bensington.

Then replacing his spectacles again he turned to the patent reading-desk, which immediately,
as his elbow came against its arm, gave a coquettish squeak and deposited the paper, with all
its diagrams in a dispersed and crumpled state, on the floor. "By Jove!" said Mr. Bensington,
straining his stomach over the armchair with a patient disregard of the habits of this convenience,
and then, finding the pamphlet still out of reach, he went down on all fours in pursuit. It
was on the floor that the idea of calling it the Food of the Gods came to him....

For you see, if he was right and Redwood was right, then by injecting or administering this
new substance of his in food, he would do away with the "resting phase," and instead of growth
going on in this fashion,

 it would (if you follow me) go thus--

IV.

The night after his conversation with Redwood Mr. Bensington could scarcely sleep a wink. He
did seem once to get into a sort of doze, but it was only for a moment, and then he dreamt
he had dug a deep hole into the earth and poured in tons and tons of the Food of the Gods,
and the earth was swelling and swelling, and all the boundaries of the countries were bursting,
and the Royal Geographical Society was all at work like one great guild of tailors letting
out the equator....

That of course was a ridiculous dream, but it shows the state of mental excitement into which
Mr. Bensington got and the real value he attached to his idea, much better than any of the
things he said or did when he was awake and on his guard. Or I should not have mentioned it,
because as a general rule I do not think it is at all interesting for people to tell each other
about their dreams.

By a singular coincidence Redwood also had a dream that night, and his dream was this:--

 It was a diagram done in fire upon a long scroll of the
abyss. And he (Redwood) was standing on a planet before a sort of black
platform lecturing about the new sort of growth that was now possible,
to the More than Royal Institution of Primordial Forces--forces which
had always previously, even in the growth of races, empires, planetary
systems, and worlds, gone so:--

And even in some cases so:--

And he was explaining to them quite lucidly and convincingly that these slow, these even retrogressive
methods would be very speedily quite put out of fashion by his discovery.

Ridiculous of course! But that too shows--

That either dream is to be regarded as in any way significant or prophetic beyond what I have
categorically said, I do not for one moment suggest.

CHAPTER THE SECOND.

THE EXPERIMENTAL FARM.

I.

Mr. Bensington proposed originally to try this stuff, so soon as he was really able to prepare
it, upon tadpoles. One always does try this sort of thing upon tadpoles to begin with; this
being what tadpoles are for. And it was agreed that he should conduct the experiments and not
Redwood, because Redwood's laboratory was occupied with the ballistic apparatus and animals
necessary for an investigation into the Diurnal Variation in the Butting Frequency of the Young
Bull Calf, an investigation that was yielding curves of an abnormal and very perplexing sort,
and the presence of glass globes of tadpoles was extremely undesirable while this particular
research was in progress.

But when Mr. Bensington conveyed to his cousin Jane something of what he had in mind, she put
a prompt veto upon the importation of any considerable number of tadpoles, or any such experimental
creatures, into their flat. She had no objection whatever to his use of one of the rooms of
the flat for the purposes of a non-explosive chemistry that, so far as she was concerned, came
to nothing; she let him have a gas furnace and a sink and a dust-tight cupboard of refuge from
the weekly storm of cleaning she would not forego. And having known people addicted to drink,
she regarded his solicitude for distinction in learned societies as an excellent substitute
for the coarser form of depravity. Not merely did it happen that he knew the russian advancement, but
never he could speak a substance of three deferential dialects, also that the pair were old to understand
one this. But before his arrival on the scene, she had commanded Potapitch to stake for her;
until at length he had told him also to go about his business. Upon that Pole had leapt into
the breach. Another she did under the direction of the Pole whom, that afternoon, she had
dowered with two ten-gulden pieces. Yet the able lady unfavourably discontinue to abuse if him,
despite his different idiom, and to compare him so with myself (so,
at all events, Potapitch declared).

"you," the old treasurer said to me, "treated her as a gentleman should, but he-- he overcharge
her right and left, as i could see with my own eyes. He said that nothing ought to stand in the
way of the Advancement of Science, and she said that the Advancement of Science was one thing
and having a lot of tadpoles in a flat was another; he said that in Germany it was an ascertained
fact that a man with an idea like his would at once have twenty thousand properly-fitted cubic
feet of laboratory placed at his disposal, and she said she was glad and always had been glad
that she was not a German; he said that it would make him famous for ever, and she said it
was much more likely to make him ill to have a lot of tadpoles in a flat like theirs; he said
he was master in his own house, and she said that rather than wait on a lot of tadpoles she'd
go as matron to a school; and then he asked her to be reasonable, and she asked him to be reasonable
then and give up all this about tadpoles; and he said she might respect his ideas, and she
said not if they were smelly she wouldn't, and then he gave way completely and said--in spite
of the classical remarks of Huxley upon the subject--a bad word. Not a very bad word it was,
but bad enough.

And after that she was greatly offended and had to be apologised to, and the prospect of ever
trying the Food of the Gods upon tadpoles in their flat at any rate vanished completely in
the apology.

So Bensington had to consider some other way of carrying out these experiments in feeding that
would be necessary to demonstrate his discovery, so soon as he had his substance isolated and
prepared. For some days he meditated upon the possibility of boarding out his tadpoles with
some trustworthy person, and then the chance sight of the phrase in a newspaper turned his
thoughts to an Experimental Farm.

And chicks. Directly he thought of it, he thought of it as a poultry farm. He was suddenly
taken with a vision of wildly growing chicks. At a length, wholly assimilate in the game, she split
out: "Alexis Ivanovitch, did not the croupier just say that 4000
florins were the most that could be staked at any time?

To oppose her was useless. Well, take these 4000, and stake them upon
the red."
 He was quite puzzled
to understand why he had not thought of chicks instead of tadpoles from the beginning. Among
other things it would have saved all this trouble with his cousin Jane. And when he suggested
this to Redwood, Redwood quite agreed with him.

Redwood said that in working so much upon needlessly small animals he was convinced experimental
physiologists made a great mistake. It is exactly like making experiments in chemistry with
an insufficient quantity of material; errors of observation and manipulation become disproportionately
large. It was of extreme importance just at present that scientific men should assert their
right to have their material big. That was why he was doing his present series of experiments
at the Bond Street College upon Bull Calves, in spite of a certain amount of inconvenience
to the students and professors of other subjects caused by their incidental levity in the corridors.
But the curves he was getting were quite exceptionally interesting, and would, when published,
amply justify his choice. For his own part, were it not for the inadequate endowment of science
in this country, he would never, if he could avoid it, work on anything smaller than a whale.
But a Public Vivarium on a sufficient scale to render this possible was, he feared, at present,
in this country at any rate, a Utopian demand. In Germany--Etc.
