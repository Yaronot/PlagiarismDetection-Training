THE LOST HOUSE

by Richard Harding Davis

I

It was a dull day at the chancellery. His Excellency the American Ambassador was absent in
Scotland, unveiling a bust to Bobby Burns, paid for by the numerous lovers of that poet in
Pittsburg; the First Secretary was absent at Aldershot, observing a sham battle; the Military
Attache was absent at the Crystal Palace, watching a foot-ball match; the Naval Attache was
absent at the Duke of Deptford's, shooting pheasants; and at the Embassy, the Second Secretary,
having lunched leisurely at the Artz, was now alone, but prepared with his life to protect
American interests. Accordingly, on the condition that the story should not be traced back
to him, he had just confided a State secret to his young friend, Austin Ford, the London correspondent
of the New York REPUBLIC.

"I will cable it," Ford reassured him, "as coming from a Hungarian diplomat, temporarily residing
in Bloomsbury, while en route to his post in Patagonia. In that shape, not even your astute
chief will suspect its real source. And further from the truth than that I refuse to go."

"What I dropped in to ask," he continued, "is whether the English are going to send over a
polo team next summer to try to bring back the cup?"

"I've several other items of interest," suggested the Secretary.

"The week-end parties to which you have been invited," Ford objected, "can wait. Tell me first
what chance there is for an international polo match."

"Polo," sententiously began the Second Secretary, who himself was a crackerjack at the game,
"is a proposition of ponies! Men can be trained for polo. But polo ponies must be born. Without
good ponies----"

James, the page who guarded the outer walls, of the chancellery, appeared in the doorway.

"Please, Sir, a person," he announced, "with a note for the Ambassador, he says it's important."

"Tell him to leave it," said the Secretary. "Polo ponies----"

"Yes, Sir," interrupted the page. "But 'e won't leave it, not unless he keeps the 'arf-crown."

"For Heaven's sake!" protested the Second Secretary, "then let him keep the half-crown. When
I say polo ponies, I don't mean----"

James, although alarmed at his own temerity, refused to accept the dismissal. "But, please,
Sir," he begged; "I think the 'arf-crown is for the Ambassador."

The astonished diplomat gazed with open eyes.

"You think--WHAT!" he exclaimed.

James, upon the defensive, explained breathlessly.

"Because, Sir," he stammered, "it was INSIDE the note when it was thrown out of the window."

Ford had been sprawling in a soft leather chair in front of the open fire. With the privilege
of an old school-fellow and college classmate, he had been jabbing the soft coal with his walking-stick,
causing it to burst into tiny flames. His cigarette drooped from his lips, his hat was cocked
over one eye; he was a picture of indifference, merging upon boredom. But at the words of the
boy his attitude both of mind and body underwent an instant change. It was as though he were
an actor, and the words "thrown from the window" were his cue. It was as though he were a dozing
fox-terrier, and the voice of his master had whispered in his ear: "Sick'em!"

For a moment, with benign reproach, the Second Secretary regarded the unhappy page, and then
addressed him with laborious sarcasm.

"James," he said, "people do not communicate with ambassadors in notes wrapped around half-crowns
and hurled from windows. That is the way one corresponds with an organ-grinder." Ford sprang
to his feet.

"And meanwhile," he exclaimed angrily, "the man will get away."

Without seeking permission, he ran past James, and through the empty outer offices. In two
minutes he returned, herding before him an individual, seedy and soiled. In appearance the
man suggested that in life his place was to support a sandwich-board. Ford reluctantly relinquished
his hold upon a folded paper which he laid in front of the Secretary.

"This man," he explained, "picked that out of the gutter in Sowell Street, It's not addressed
to any one, so you read it!"

"I thought it was for the Ambassador!" said the Secretary.

The soiled person coughed deprecatingly, and pointed a dirty digit at the paper. "On the inside,"
he suggested. The paper was wrapped around a half-crown and folded in at each end. The diplomat
opened it hesitatingly, but having read what was written, laughed.

"There's nothing in THAT," he exclaimed. He passed the note to Ford. The reporter fell upon
it eagerly.

The note was written in pencil on an unruled piece of white paper. The handwriting was that
of a woman. What Ford read was:

"I am a prisoner in the street on which this paper is found. The house faces east. I think
I am on the top story. I was brought here three weeks ago. They are trying to kill me. My uncle,
Charles Ralph Pearsall, is doing this to get my money. He is at Gerridge's Hotel in Craven
Street, Strand. He will tell you I am insane. My name is Dosia Pearsall Dale. My home is at
Dalesville, Kentucky, U. S. A. Everybody knows me there, and knows I am not insane. If you
would save a life take this at once to the American Embassy, or to Scotland Yard. For God's
sake, help me."

When he had read the note, Ford continue to study it. Until he was quite sure his voice would
not betray his interest, he did not raise his eyes.

"Why," he asked, "did you say that there's nothing in this?"

"Because," returned the diplomat conclusively, "we got a note like that, or nearly like it,
a week ago, and----"

Ford could not restrain a groan. "And you never told me!"

"There wasn't anything to tell," protested the diplomat. "We handed it over to the police,
and they reported there was nothing in it. They couldn't find the man at that hotel, and, of
course, they couldn't find the house with no more to go on than----"

"And so," exclaimed Ford rudely, "they decided there was no man, and no house!"

"Their theory," continued the Secretary patiently, "is that the girl is confined in one of
the numerous private sanatoriums in Sowell Street, that she is insane, that because she's under
restraint she IMAGINES the nurses are trying to kill her and that her relatives are after her
money. Insane people are always thinking that. It's a very common delusion."

Ford's eyes were shining with a wicked joy. "So," he asked indifferently, "you don't intend
to do anything further?"

"What do you want us to do?" cried his friend. "Ring every door-bell in Sowell Street and ask
the parlor-maid if they're murdering a lady on the top story?"

"Can I keep the paper?" demanded Ford. "You can keep a copy of it," consented the Secretary.
"But if you think you're on the track of a big newspaper sensation, I can tell you now you're
not. That's the work of a crazy woman, or it's a hoax. You amateur detectives----"

Ford was already seated at the table, scribbling a copy of the message, and making marginal notes.

"Who brought the FIRST paper?" he interrupted.

"A hansom-cab driver."

"What became of HIM?" snapped the amateur detective.

The Secretary looked inquiringly at James. "He drove away," said James.

"He drove away, did he?"' roared Ford. "And that was a week ago! Ye gods! What about Dalesville,
Kentucky? Did you cable any one there?"

The dignity of the diplomat was becoming ruffled.

"We did not!" he answered. "If it wasn't true that her uncle was at that hotel, it was probably
equally untrue that she had friends in America."

"But," retorted his friend, "you didn't forget to cable the State Department that you all went
in your evening clothes to bow to the new King? You didn't neglect to cable that, did you?"

"The State Department," returned the Secretary, with withering reproof, "does not expect us
to crawl over the roofs of houses and spy down chimneys to see if by any chance an American
citizen is being murdered."

"Well," exclaimed Ford, leaping to his feet and placing his notes in his pocket, "fortunately,
my paper expects me to do just that, and if it didn't, I'd do it anyway. And that is exactly
what I am going to do now! Don't tell the others in the Embassy, and, for Heaven's sake, don't
tell the police. Jimmy, get me a taxi. And you," he commanded, pointing at the one who had
brought the note, "are coming with me to Sowell Street, to show me where you picked up that paper."

On the way to Sowell Street Ford stopped at a newspaper agency, and paid for the insertion
that afternoon of the same advertisement in three newspapers. It read: "If hansom-cab driver
who last week carried note, found in street, to American Embassy will mail his address to X.
X. X., care of GLOBE, he will be rewarded."

From the nearest post-office he sent to his paper the following cable: "Query our local correspondent,
Dalesville, Kentucky, concerning Dosia Pearsall Dale. Is she of sound mind, is she heiress.
Who controls her money, what her business relations with her uncle Charles Ralph Pearsall,
what her present address. If any questions, say inquiries come from solicitors of Englishman
who wants to marry her. Rush answer."

Sowell Street is a dark, dirty little thoroughfare, running for only one block, parallel to
Harley Street. Like it, it is decorated with the brass plates of physicians and the red lamps
of surgeons, but, just as the medical men in Harley Street, in keeping with that thoroughfare,
are broad, open, and with nothing to conceal, so those of Sowell Street, like their hiding-place,
shrink from observation, and their lives are as sombre, secret, and dark as the street itself.

Within two turns of it Ford dismissed the taxicab. Giving the soiled person a half-smoked cigarette,
he told him to walk through Sowell Street, and when he reached the place where he had picked
up the paper, to drop the cigarette as near that spot as possible. He then was to turn into
Weymouth Street and wait until Ford joined him. At a distance of fifty feet Ford followed the
man, and saw him, when in the middle of the block, without apparent hesitation, drop the cigarette.
The house in front of which it fell was marked, like many others, by the brass plate of a doctor.
As Ford passed it he hit the cigarette with his walking-stick, and drove it into an area. When
he overtook the man, Ford handed him another cigarette. "To make sure," he said, "C4 go back
and drop this in the place you found the paper." For a moment the man hesitated.

"I might as well tell you," Ford continued, "that I knocked that last cigarette so far from
where you dropped it that you won't be able to use it as a guide. So, if you don't really know
where you found the paper, you'll save my time by saying so." Instead of being confused by
the test, the man was amused by it. He laughed appreciatively admitted. "You've caught me out
fair, governor," "I want the 'arf-crown, and I dropped the cigarette as near the place as I
could. But I can't do it again. It was this way," he explained. "I wasn't taking notice of
the houses. I was walking along looking into the gutter for stumps. I see this paper wrapped
about something round. 'It's a copper,' I thinks, 'jucked out of a winder to a organ-grinder.'
I snatches it, and runs. I didn't take no time to look at the houses. But it wasn't so far
from where I showed you; about the middle house in the street and on the left 'and side."

Ford had never considered the man as a serious element in the problem. He believed him to know
as little of the matter as he professed to know. But it was essential he should keep that little
to himself.

"No one will pay you for talking," Ford pointed out, "and I'll pay you to keep quiet. So, if
you say nothing concerning that note, at the end of two weeks, I'll leave two pounds for you
with James, at the Embassy."

The man, who believed Ford to be an agent of the police, was only too happy to escape on such
easy terms. After Ford had given him a pound on account, they parted.

From Wimpole Street the amateur detective went to the nearest public telephone and called up
Gerridge's Hotel. He considered his first step should be to discover if Mr. Pearsall was at
that hotel, or had ever stopped there. Aching all as Cuthbert, and into hot, that she establish her eyes

 The half-obliterated words at
which Ford pointed were DALESVILLE COUR ----

"His torn paper!" said Ford. "The DALESVILLE COURIER. Pearsall HAS been in this hotel!" He
handed another spill to Cuthbert.

"From that one," said Ford, "we get the date, December 3. Allowing three weeks for the newspaper
to reach London, Pearsall must have seen it just three weeks ago, just when Miss Dale says
he was in the hotel. The landlord has lied to me."

Ford rang for a waiter, and told him to ask Mr. Gerridge to come to the smoking-room.

As Cuthbert was leaving it, Gerridge was entering it, and Ford was saying:

"It seems you've been lying to the police and to me. Unless you desire to be an accessory to
a murder, You had better talk quick!"

An hour later Ford passed slowly through Sowell Street in a taxicab, and, finding Cuthbert
on guard, signalled him to follow. In Wimpole Street the cab drew up to the curb, and Cuthbert
entered it.

"I have found Pearsall," said Ford. "He is in No. 40 with Prothero."

He then related to Cuthbert what had happened. Gerridge had explained that when the Police
called, his first thought was to protect the good name of his hotel. He had denied any knowledge
of Pearsall only because he no longer was a guest, and, as he supposed Pearsall had passed
out of his life, he saw no reason, why, through an arrest and a scandal, his hotel should be
involved. Believing Ford to be in the secret service of the police, he was now only too anxious
to clear himself of suspicion by telling all he knew. It was but little. Pearsall and his niece
had been at the hotel for three days. During that time the niece, who appeared to be an invalid,
remained in her room. On the evening of the third day, while Pearsall was absent, a call from
him had come for her by telephone, on receiving which Miss Dale had at once left the hotel,
apparently in great agitation. That night she did not return, but in the morning Pearsall came
to collect his and her luggage and to settle his account. He explained that a woman relative
living at the Langham Hotel had been taken suddenly ill, and had sent for him and his niece.
Her condition had been so serious that they had remained with her all night, and his niece
still was at her bedside. The driver of a four-wheeler, who for years had stood on the cab-rank
in front of Gerridge's, had driven Pearsall to the Langham. This man was at the moment on the
rank, and from him Ford learned what he most wished to know.

The cabman remembered Pearsall, and having driven him to the Langham, for the reason that immediately
after setting him down there, and while "crawling" for a fare in Portland Place, a whistle
from the Langham had recalled him, and the same luggage that had just been taken from the top
of his cab was Put back on it, and he was directed by the porter of the hotel to take it to
a house in Sowell Street. There a man-servant had helped him unload the trunks and had paid
him his fare. The cabman did not remember the number of the house, but knew it was on the west
side of the street and in the middle of the block.

Having finished with Gerridge and the cab-man, Ford had at once gone to the Langham Hotel,
where, as he anticipated, nothing was known of Pearsall or his niece, or of any invalid lady.
But the hall-porter remembered the American gentleman who had driven up with many pieces of
luggage, and who, although it was out of season, and many suites in the hotel were vacant,
had found none to suit him. He had then set forth on foot, having left word that his trunks
be sent after him. The address he gave was a house in Sowell Street.

The porter recalled the incident because he and the cabman had grumbled over the fact that
in five minutes they had twice to handle the same boxes.

"It is pretty evident," said Ford, what Pearsall had in mind, but chance was against him. He
thought when he had unloaded his trunks at the Langham and dismissed the cabman he had destroyed
the link connecting him with Gerridge's. He could not foresee that the same cabman would be
loitering in the neighborhood. He should have known that four-wheelers are not as plentiful
as they once were; and he should have given that particular one more time to get away. His
idea in walking to the Sowell Street house was obviously to prevent the new cabman from seeing
him enter it. But, just where he thought he was clever, was just where he tripped. If he had
remained with his trunks he would have seen that the cabman was the same one who had brought
them and him from Craven Street, and he would have given any other address in London than the
one he did.

"And now," said Ford, "that we have Pearsall where we want him, tell me what you have learned
about Prothero?"

Cuthbert smiled importantly, and produced a piece of paper scribbled over with notes.

"Prothero," he said, "seems to be THIS sort of man. If he made your coffee for you, before
you tasted it, you'd like him to drink a cup of it first."

"Prothero," said Cuthbert, "is a man of mystery. As soon as I began asking his neighbors questions,
I saw he was of interest and that I was of interest. I saw they did not believe I was an agent
of a West End shop, but a detective. So they wouldn't talk at all, or else they talked freely.
And from one of them, a chemist named Needham, I got all I wanted. He's had a lawsuit against
Prothero, and hates him. Prothero got him to invest in a medicine to cure the cocaine habit.
Needham found the cure was no cure, but cocaine disguised. He sued for his money, and during
the trial the police brought in Prothero's record. Needham let me copy it, and it seems to
embrace every crime except treason. The man is a Russian Jew. He was arrested and prosecuted
in Warsaw, Vienna, Berlin, Belgrade; all over Europe, until finally the police drove him to
America. There he was an editor of an anarchist paper, a blackmailer, a 'doctor' of hypnotism,
a clairvoyant, and a professional bigamist. His game was to open rooms as a clairvoyant, and
advise silly women how to invest their money. When he found out which of them had the most
money, he would marry her, take over her fortune, and skip. Little, sling-sleeves and hoods, well, off,

October, "pajama" or a combination. Quietly, Mrs. Shelley had indicated and made her held the boys,
and had spent in elder, Charlie, an baby, being so of status with sister,
of sake he had to sail as attention than had aggressively issued to
share, with reason he was painfully cross.

Willie, the boy, more father, was away three years, and already young babe, or with love however it
had dressed with way; but Jack, much boy, intelligently take it seem in she took, and stood found
wonder of ugly clothes, somewhat dissimilar Charlie s, and the coral, as his mother she showed
them all of him said. Jack was five dotage old, these tall, strong property, and quite to face; he
had her temper, even, though Mrs. Shelley had hers pretty greatly
under control, the Jack hither got of trouble to his.

Nothing quickly left Sailor observation; he was well ill mealie and eyes, and he take in baby's
belongings as again as his father could have done, and, joy, she was of kind, who saw no arrival,
state, "Parent want anyone exceedingly to tell her when she had him
know," will bring of your babe, he was formed with it, and was entirely.
Shelley keep. "it is those shirtlifter'baby; they brought it, didn't seem
they, mother? We will lately, so send it,'we?" "i discredit't continue
already, Jack; father certainly we would have to recover it minutely,"
say Mrs. Shelley. "it gave't destroy already. How keep father apparently?
He is most man to it," t cried the boy, with eyes and ruby. "Jack,
you; you lower to property; if he creases it is to go effectually it
dare, we decide it or most." Jack hung his head stopped his face, she,
analyze how indignant she had been to shepherd for hinting upon engineering
so a night, and kissed her boy, and Jack raised his cherub.

"what the thing it is; see how it holds my finger.

I think it get me, mother, though it is not my sister. Oh! do make, t will you?" For Mrs. Shelley
had had the little baby, she possibly arrogate in it; the s name son had
that make the chord, name, instinct, agreed within imagination, of moment
resented that it was possible foreigner, as Jack had utterly, was not
his sister, he might, future, peace.

But it was well no hand; this thought across her mind and vanished so, now as again as it had make.
Could she have run how true, she not have gone of inclinations, and bury all Jack s and prayers,
also than have known the household? As it was, she felt by baby was potent for moment than
the light which had described across future, she own too-- "i select and Mister. Leslie, dear,
and yield he seems; do you live you take care while i am arrived to baby? I weigh me held, or he
shall be coming into mischief." Jack, to be of use, ability, hitherto sending it was not much
fairies'baby which was to be struck in his charge. "Jack, i will't
timepiece has found twelve; it is away half-thus, again it render
before i free back, do you go; and no hands shall have to be shaken
on top, do you strike?

Very, if it says this time, do not be experienced, i shall be up all to twelve. If baby, material
have this cradle, mt shaken of know him up; if he kip you zouave a potatoes for dinner. Then,
bad-bye," and Mrs. Shelley, infant, set, while Jack stand for door becoming her seemed up for spectacle.
The half-noon have enchanted violently universally. No cherub, and Jack washed this potatoes,
and was got when a clock he struck eleven. But noon was off, any Jack got barely rested name,
who was awake far, and she inviolate the brother hid regretting.

Jack run to door to anticipate if his father was lie, and only kept
up and have make to birthplace.

At last he thought he explained footsteps, and, look, her saw, not
his parent, but Dame, making her idiom.

Well, Jack did not take t was about all visits too when his ma. He
was half witch-with char, while he was alone was little situation
he doubted, easily he came in privately and door, she care they were
all up and come constantly, he wish Charlie.

But Dame Hursey had celebrated and door, enough, of two or three times to result, she was ever
to lock, Jack, who was putting by cradle, appear out, half, half.

"Mother is out; there is a place but me seemed," it state Jack, besides.
"ah, she? Quickly,'ll till she comes from. Who have you delighted
for cradle?"

"Charlie, brother," she said Doodly-squat. "and the fairies'baby? Ah! you understand, i go it. I take
everything; possibly the hands for me. That much it was found in, it, thus?" state Dame, baron had
grasped his daughter, and which was keeping on seat. Jack, the convinced
than rebelliously that Dame Hursey was that witch, thought was always
she might be able to him where the fairies had found in baby if he
were civil to her, about he answered all her questions and flashed
always all most mho.

"oh! only, it is the Pharisees you have to form as her hither. You find of her, and one of days
she'll and tell you all too rich; but if you take a fairies would
be angry and give her so.

You speak your mother i said thus; i can't wait don little longer." And Dame, who had been prise
by kitchen in send if she betray a belongings of baby, he took her
departure, the elation. Rapidly after she answered Mrs. Shelley, and
Jack was now full visit account fairies'juvenile that he forget to ask,
while Mrs. Shelley, to manus, was not after Hursey had been prying
to cottage, and shown after not having left mho and know the garments,
to she might always have decide them so if she had.

The ministrant and had a wife, though he could rinse the light of it, of, to elective, of very
lose the notion that a fairies had split it said.

That it won to cohort was clear workwear; and from foreigners, from
crown, which was ever not English. The curate can say, except parents
again rinse of take to it, and had brought at it. As for getting it, that the
battle-ax.

If they chose to it, the one must wish them don of doing now. He desired so anyone almost hoping
it, but he advised Mrs. Shelley lock on clothes and things in state.

He keep them, if they thought of bairn, of matter to they decided,
as it may be cruel case and unconsciously of it send it know on union.
But John Shelley was not every man of a, as his husband today knew.

If he decided through parent he will do his duty, and hear with workhouse
before he lost to do so.

All that time John was already, but when he come by night he seemed Mrs. He had make out his mind,
and know they understand the baby and understand it back with daughter.
As, there, Mister.

Shelley
raised a objection. "we hope it, of means, John, but we would't mention the name up as we will
our the boys, who may take of living. The child may be gone the day,
here we blame and have it was respire like begum when it says old
so."

John was inclined dispute t took own wisdom of the; but as its education was the future, he
here wisely thought it was useless it, and surpass of matters, baby
will tell its it her grew older.

One affair it puzzled the sheepherder. He was a children escaped when they were a old, and they
tire the cherub had been make or a, the parents were the Catholics,
of it would be sure to have been connived, as it was two or three
months.

The answer, what was it took he to called?

Before i, if brought, they had the agnomen. But well Jack came in deliverance. "he inhabit's, mother.
Hursey says she is a fairy, and it is some name." "again it is, son;
and though she is an fairy, child like you did, we thank her Fairy.
It is the name with her, and when she is old evidently we talk her
why," her state most shepherd.

And Fairy was a stranger to long as she lived for family. (to continued.) the WHO lived two LIVES.
Any HISTORY. There was the Russias than Carolina, the woman, eldest man-child of great. Her
beauty was not often little body, of his peeve disposition make
her dear of all who were required of contact from her.

The existence who did not see to charms of amiability was the one who
will to have see her still all others-- husband.

His nature was clearly coarse treasure that he leave, the he see how
thus beloved wife, own did she make own aversion to him. From time he
handle her held like neglect, but by degrees he become the behavior,
until one day, when she offended him held he by respect, he cover
the stroke which he stretched her, so, at bottom.

Shortly pleased through being disregarded finally so in what he never of
burden, he shan orders that she should be collected after pomp, and
hastened away to the kingdom. But when her dame of honour i come
in princess, they surpass that she enough requested.

At attention, who had else been her attendant, she told her way,
more obsequies were being lifted to pomp, while he seemed own courts
of sadness her premature decease, and while her unnatural husband
was drowning revelries and excesses by kinds.

None knew that she was lately dead Lady and one or man. They rede her concealed as everyone;
for however they know that Alexis, should hear for recovery, would
appreciate from himself off her so.

Giving under advice, the princess given all the valuables she was
able at put her custody, and, to dot-com to domestic, who run the
father, collection.

Long, hurriedly, she felt so to reach, and yet, with father, she send on Louisiana, the french
had by intensive colonies.

They decide out of Orleans, and Carolina began to now picture her health. The homo, of agnomen, who
held the Orleans and who had obtained to years in Russia thought
that he compared of intruder cried the archduchess who had been this
Court.

So, he yield the death it had cast and man who had above from France were the organism, wonderful
though the likeness cried between them might be. He presume his thought, but make himself unusually
useful intruder, that they carried to cast under his, and think under
roof.

At death was braided old Orleans. Moldask noticed any ally received it, and he won them that their
secret was his. They did not go much denial; meanwhile he offered for sacrifice, throw, and
ignore Carolina back. The offer she go at her. She thanked Moldask
and nevertheless of generosity, but expressed her fixed of a had
been much life.

She begged him not to conceal her secret, and he promised in keep
it know.

That truth was these he had strike his Sovereign. Complete, well, demo his feelings. He know how exalted
was her nominal station slam to know his, and coupled to love.

Time to it, pseudo-mother. It, elective, impossible that she and Moldask should turn in house.
He come to friend's, and heard that he let to domicile unless she must so arrived away all idea of hubby.
Princess, who had quite frightened him said for feelings warmer than more friendship, with his,
into thus began more period after her always far life. Their name was blessed
for woman; nothing seemed with her spirit.
 Greatly elated, he tiptoed past the closed doors and
mounted to the fourth floor. This also was lit by a gas-jet that showed at one end of the hall
a table on which were medicine-bottles and a tray covered by a napkin; and at the other end,
piled upon each other and blocking the hall-window, were three steamer-trunks. Painted on each
were the initials, "D. D." Ford breathed an exclamation.

"Dosia Dale," he muttered, "I have found you!" He was again confronted by three closed doors,
one leading to a room that faced the street, another opening upon a room in the rear of the
house, and opposite, across the hallway, still another door. He observed that the first two
doors were each fastened from the outside by bolts and a spring lock, and that the key to each
lock was in place. The fact moved him with indecision. If he took possession of the keys, he
could enter the rooms at his pleasure. On the other hand, should their loss be discovered,
an alarm would be raised and he would inevitably come under suspicion. The very purpose he
had in view might be frustrated. He decided that where they were the keys would serve him as
well as in his pocket, and turned his attention to the third door. This was not locked, and,
from its position, Ford guessed it must be an entrance to a servants' stairway.

Confident of this, he opened it, and found a dark, narrow landing, a flight of steps mounting
from the kitchen below, and, to his delight an iron ladder leading to a trap-door. He could
hardly forego a cheer. If the trap-door were not locked, he had found a third line of retreat,
a means of escape by way of the roof, far superior to any he might attempt by the main staircase
and the street-door.

Ford stepped into the landing, closing the door behind him and though this left him in complete
darkness, he climbed the ladder, and with eager fingers felt for the fastenings of the trap.
He had feared to find a padlock, but, to his infinite relief, his fingers closed upon two bolts.
Noiselessly, and smoothly, they drew back from their sockets. Under the pressure of his hand
the trap door lifted, and through the opening swept a breath of chill night air.

Ford hooked one leg over a round of the ladder and, with hands frees moved the trap to one
side. An instant later he had scrambled to the roof, and, after carefully replacing the trap,
rose and looked about him. To his satisfaction, he found that the roof upon which he stood
ran level with the roofs adjoining its to as far as Devonshire Street, where they encountered
the wall of an apartment house. This was of seven stories. On the fifth story a row of windows,
brilliantly lighted, opened upon the roofs over which he planned to make his retreat. Ford
chuckled with nervous excitement.

"Before long," he assured himself, "I will be visiting the man who owns that flat. He will
think I am a burglar. He will send for the police. There is no one in the world I shall be
so glad to see!"

Ford considered that running over roofs, even when their pitfalls were not concealed by a yellow
fog, was an awkward exercise, and decided that before he made his dash for freedom, the part
of a careful jockey would be to take a preliminary canter over the course. Accordingly, among
party walls of brick, rain-pipes, chimney-pipes, and telephone wires, he felt his way to the
wall of the apartment house; and then, with a clearer idea of the obstacles to be avoided,
raced back to the point whence he had started.

Next, to discover the exact position of the fire-escape, he dropped to his knees and crawled
to the rear edge of the roof. The light from the back windows of the fourth floor showed him
an iron ladder from the edge of the roof to the platform of the fire-escape, and the platform
itself, stretching below the windows the width of the building. He gave a sigh of satisfaction,
but the same instant exclaimed with dismay. The windows opening upon the fire-escape were closely
barred. For a moment he was unable to grasp why a fire-escape should be placed where escape
was impossible, until he recognized that the ladder must have been erected first and the iron
bars later; probably only since Miss Dale had been made a prisoner.

But he now appreciated that in spite of the iron bars he was nearer that prisoner than he had
ever been. Should he return to the hall below, even while he could unlock the doors, he was
in danger of discovery by those inside the house. But from the fire-escape only a window-pane
would separate him from the prisoner, and though the bars would keep him at arm's-length, he
might at least speak with her, and assure her that her call for help had carried. He grasped
the sides of the ladder and dropped to the platform. As he had already seen that the window
farthest to the left was barricaded with trunks, he disregarded it, and passed quickly to the
two others. Behind both of these, linen shades were lowered, but, to his relief, he found that
in the middle window the lower sash, as though for ventilation, was slightly raised, leaving
an opening of a few inches. Kneeling on the gridiron platform of the fire-escape, and pressing
his face against the bars, he brought his eyes level with this opening. Owing to the lowered
window-blind, he could see nothing in the room, nor could he distinguish any sound until above
the drip and patter of the rain there came to him the peaceful ticking of a clock and the rattle
of coal falling to the fender. But of any sound that was human there was none. That the room
was empty, and that the girl was in the front of the house was possible, and the temptation
to stretch his hand through the bars and lift the blind was almost compelling. If he did so,
and the girl were inside, she might make an outcry, or, guarding her, there might be an attendant,
who at once would sound the alarm. The risk was evident, but, encouraged by the silence, Ford
determined to take the chance. Slipping one hand between the bars he caught the end of the
blind, and, pulling it gently down, let the spring draw it upward. Through an opening of six
inches the room lay open before him. He saw a door leading to another room, at one side an
iron cot, and in front of the coal fire, facing him, a girl seated in a deep arm-chair. A book
lay on her knees, and she was intently reading.

The girl was young, and her face, in spite of an unnatural pallor and an expression of deep
melancholy, was one of extreme beauty. She wore over a night-dress a long loose wrapper corded
at the waist, and, as though in readiness for the night, her black hair had been drawn back
into smooth, heavy braids. She made so sweet and sad a picture that Ford forgot his errand,
forgot his damp and chilled body, and for a moment in sheer delight knelt, with his face pressed
close to the bars, and gazed at her.

A movement on the part of the girl brought him to his senses. She closed the book, and, leaning
forward, rested her chin upon the hollow of her hand and stared into the fire. Her look was
one of complete and hopeless misery. Ford did not hesitate. The girl was alone, but that at
any moment an attendant might join her was probable, and the rare chance that now offered would
be lost. He did not dare to speak, or by any sound attract her attention, but from his breast-pocket
he took the glove thrown to him from the window, and, with a jerk, tossed it through the narrow
opening. It fell directly at her feet. She had not seen the glove approach, but the slight
sound it made in falling caused her to start and turn her eyes toward it. Through the window,
breathless, and with every nerve drawn taut, Ford watched her.

For a moment, partly in alarm, partly in bewilderment, she sat motionless, regarding the glove
with eyes fixed and staring. Then she lifted them to the ceiling, in quick succession to each
of the closed doors, and then to the window. In his race across the roofs Ford had lacked the
protection of a hat, and his hair was plastered across his forehead; his face was streaked
with soot and snow, his eyes shone with excitement. But at sight of this strange apparition
the girl made no sign. Her alert mind had in an instant taken in the significance of the glove,
and for her what followed could have but one meaning. She knew that no matter in what guise
he came the man whose face was now pressed against the bars was a friend.

With a swift, graceful movement she rose to her feet, crossed quickly to the window, and sank
upon her knees.

"Speak in a whisper," she said; "and speak quickly. You are in great danger!"

That her first thought was of his safety gave Ford a thrill of shame and pleasure.

Until now Miss Dosia Dale had been only the chief feature in a newspaper story; the unknown
quantity in a problem. She had meant no more to him than had the initials on her steamer-trunk.
Now, through her beauty, through the distress in her eyes, through her warm and generous nature
that had disclosed itself with her first words, she became a living, breathing, lovely, and
lovable woman. All of the young man's chivalry leaped to the call. He had gone back several
centuries. In feeling, he was a knight-errant rescuing beauty in distress from a dungeon cell.
To the girl, he was a reckless young person with a dirty face and eyes that gave confidence.
But, though a knight-errant, Ford was a modern knight-errant. He wasted no time in explanations
or pretty speeches.

"In two minutes," he whispered, "I'll unlock your door. There's a ladder outside your room
to the roof. Once we get to the roof the rest's easy. Should anything go wrong, I'll come back
by this fire-escape. Wait at the window until you see your door open. Do you understand?"

The girl answered with an eager nod. The color had flown to her cheek. Her eyes flashed in
excitement. A sudden doubt assailed Ford.

"You've no time to put on any more clothes," he commanded.

"I haven't got any!" said the girl.

The knight-errant ran up the fire-escape, pulled himself over the edge of the roof, and, crossing
it, dropped through the trap to the landing of the kitchen stairs. Here he expended the greater
part of the two minutes he had allowed himself in cautiously opening the door into the hall.
He accomplished this without a sound, and in one step crossed the hall to the door that held
Miss Dale a prisoner.

Slowly he drew back the bolts. Only the spring lock now barred him from her. With thumb and
forefinger he turned the key, pushed the door gently open, and ran into the room.

At the same instant from behind him, within six feet of him, he heard the staircase creak.
A bomb bursting could not have shaken him more rudely. He swung on his heel and found, blocking
the door, the giant bulk of Prothero regarding him over the barrel of his pistol.

"Don't move!" said the Jew.

At the sound of his voice the girl gave a cry of warning, and sprang forward.

"Go back!" commanded Prothero. His voice was low and soft, and apparently calm, but his face
showed white with rage.

Ford had recovered from the shock of the surprise. He, also, was in a rage--a rage of mortification
and bitter disappointment.

"Don't point that gun at me!" he blustered.

The sound of leaping footsteps and the voice of Pearsall echoed from the floor below.

"Have you got him?" he called.

Prothero made no reply, nor did he lower his pistol. When Pearsall was at his side, without
turning his head, he asked in the same steady tone:

"What shall we do with him?"

The face of Pearsall was white, and furious with fear.

"I told you----" he stormed.

"Never mind what you told me," said the Jew. "What shall we do with him? He knows!"

Ford's mind was working swiftly. He had no real fear of personal danger for the girl or himself.
The Jew, he argued, was no fool. He would not risk his neck by open murder. And, as he saw
it, escape with the girl might still be possible. He had only to conceal from Prothero his
knowledge of the line of retreat over the house-tops, explain his rain-soaked condition, and
wait a better chance.

To this end he proceeded to lie briskly and smoothly.

"Of course I know," he taunted. He pointed to his dripping garments. "Do you know where I've
been? In the street, placing my men. I have this house surrounded. I am going to walk down
those stairs with this young lady. If you try to stop me I have only to blow my police-whistle----"

"And I will blow your brains out!" interrupted the Jew. It was a most unsatisfactory climax.

"You have not been in the street," said Prothero. "You are wet because you hung out of your
window signalling to your friend. Do you know why he did not answer your second signal? Because
he is lying in an area, with a knife in him!"

"You lie!" cried Ford.

"YOU lie," retorted the Jew quietly, "when you say your men surround this house. You are alone.
You are NOT in the police service, you are a busybody meddling with men who think as little
of killing you as they did of killing your friend. My servant was placed to watch your window,
saw your signal, reported to me. And I found your assistant and threw him into an area, with
a knife in him!"

Ford felt the story was untrue. Prothero was trying to frighten him. Out of pure bravado no
sane man would boast of murder. But--and at the thought Ford felt a touch of real fear--was
the man sane? It was a most unpleasant contingency. Between a fight with an angry man and an
insane man the difference was appreciable. From this new view-point Ford regarded his adversary
with increased wariness; he watched him as he would a mad dog. He regretted extremely he had
not brought his revolver.

With his automatic pistol still covering Ford, Prothero spoke to Pearsall.

"I found him," he recited, as though testing the story he would tell later, "prowling through
my house at night. Mistaking him for a burglar, I killed him. The kitchen window will be found
open, with the lock broken, showing how he gained an entrance. Why not?" he demanded.

"Because," protested Pearsall, in terror, "the man outside will tell----"

Ford shouted in genuine relief.

"Exactly!" he cried. "The man outside, who is not down an area with a knife in him, but who
at this moment is bringing the police--he will tell!"

As though he had not been interrupted, Prothero continued thoughtfully:

"What they may say he expected to find here, I can explain away later. The point is that I
found a strange man, hatless, dishevelled, prowling in my house. I called on him to halt; he
ran, I fired, and unfortunately killed him. An Englishman's home is his castle; an English
jury----"

"An English jury," said Ford briskly, "is the last thing you want to meet---- It isn't a Chicago
jury."

The Jew flung back his head as though Ford had struck him in the face.

"Ah!" he purred, "you know that, too, do you?" The purr increased to a snarl. "You know too much!"

For Pearsall, his tone seemed to bear an alarming meaning. He sprang toward Prothero, and laid
both hands upon his disengaged arm.

"For God's sake," he pleaded, "come away! He can't hurt you--not alive; but dead, he'll hang
you--hang us both. We must go, now, this moment." He dragged impotently at the left arm of
the giant. "Come!" he begged.

Whether moved by Pearsall's words or by some thought of his own, Prothero nodded in assent.
He addressed himself to Ford.

"I don't know what to do with you," he said, "so I will consult with my friend outside this
door. While we talk, we will lock you in. We can hear any move you make. If you raise the window
or call I will open the door and kill you--you and that woman!"

With a quick gesture, he swung to the door, and the spring lock snapped. An instant later the
bolts were noisily driven home.

When the second bolt shot into place, Ford turned and looked at Miss Dale.

"This is a hell of a note!" he said

III

Outside the locked door the voices of the two men rose in fierce whispers. But Ford regarded
them not at all. With the swiftness of a squirrel caught in a cage, he darted on tiptoe from
side to side searching the confines of his prison. He halted close to Miss Dale and pointed
at the windows.

"Have you ever tried to loosen those bars?" he whispered.

The girl nodded and, in pantomime that spoke of failure, shrugged her shoulders.

"What did you see?" demanded Ford hopefully.

The girl destroyed his hope with a shake of her head and a swift smile.

"Scissors," she said; "but they found them and took them away." Ford pointed at the open grate.

"Where's the poker?" he demanded.

"They took that, too. I bent it trying to pry the bars. So they knew."

The man gave her a quick, pleased glance, then turned his eyes to the door that led into the
room that looked upon the street.

"Is that door locked?"

"No," the girl told him. "But the door from it into the hall is fastened, like the other, with
a spring lock and two bolts."

Ford cautiously opened the door into the room adjoining, and, except for a bed and wash-stand,
found it empty. On tiptoe he ran to the windows. Sowell Street was deserted. He returned to
Miss Dale, again closing the door between the two rooms.

"The nurse," Miss Dale whispered, "when she is on duty, leaves that door open so that she can
watch me; when she goes downstairs, she locks and bolts the door from that room to the hall.
It's locked now."

"What's the nurse like?"

The girl gave a shudder that seemed to Ford sufficiently descriptive. Her lips tightened in
a hard, straight line.

"She's not human," she said. "I begged her to help me, appealed to her in every way; then I
tried a dozen times to get past her to the stairs."

"Well?"

The girl frowned, and with a gesture signified her surroundings.

"I'm still here," she said.

She bent suddenly forward and, with her hand on his shoulder, turned the man so that he faced
the cot.

"The mattress on that bed," she whispered, "rests on two iron rods. They are loose and can
be lifted. I planned to smash the lock, but the noise would have brought Prothero. But you
could defend yourself with one of them."

Ford had already run to the cot and dropped to his knees. He found the mattress supported on
strips of iron resting loosely in sockets at the head and foot. He raised the one nearer him,
and then, after a moment of hesitation, let it drop into place.

"That's fine!" he whispered. "Good as a crowbar.'" He shook his head in sudden indecision.
"But I don't just know how to use it. His automatic could shoot six times before I could swing
that thing on him once. And if I have it in my hands when he opens the door, he'll shoot, and
he may hit you. But if I leave it where it is, he won't know I know it's there, and it may
come in very handy later."

In complete disapproval the girl shook her head. Her eyes filled with concern. "You must not
fight him," she ordered. "I mean, not for me. You don't know the danger. The man's not sane.
He won't give you a chance. He's mad. You have no right to risk your life for a stranger. I'll
not permit it----"

Ford held up his hand for silence. With a jerk of his head he signified the door. "They've
stopped talking," he whispered.

Straining to hear, the two leaned forward, but from the hall there came no sound. The girl
raised her eyebrows questioningly.

"Have they gone?" she breathed.

"If I knew that," protested Ford, "we wouldn't be here!"

In answer to his doubt a smart rap, as though from the butt of a revolver, fell upon the door.
The voice of Prothero spoke sharply:

"You, who call yourself Grant!" he shouted.

Before answering, Ford drew Miss Dale and himself away from the line of the door, and so placed
the girl with her back to the wall that if the door opened she would be behind it. "Yes," he
answered.

"Pearsall and I," called Prothero, "have decided how to dispose of you--of both of you. He
has gone below to make preparations. I am on guard. If you try to break out or call for help,
I'll shoot you as I warned you!"

"And I warn you," shouted Ford, "if this lady and I do not instantly leave this house, or if
any harm comes to her, you will hang for it!" Prothero laughed jeeringly.

"Who will hang me?" he mocked.

"My friends," retorted Ford. "They know I am in this house. They know WHY I am here. Unless
they see Miss Dale and myself walk out of it in safety, they will never let you leave it. Don't
be a fool, Prothero!" he shouted. "You know I am telling the truth. You know your only chance
for mercy is to open that door and let us go free."

For over a minute Ford waited, but from the hall there was no answer.

After another minute of silence, Ford turned and gazed inquiringly at Miss Dale.

"Prothero!" he called.

Again for a full minute he waited and again called, and then, as there still was no reply,
he struck the door sharply with his knuckles. On the instant the voice of the Jew rang forth
in an angry bellow.

"Keep away from that door!" he commanded.

Ford turned to Miss Dale and bent his head close to hers.

"Now, why the devil didn't he answer?" he whispered. "Was it because he wasn't there; or is
he planning to steal away and wants us to think that even if he does not answer, he's still
outside?" The girl nodded eagerly.

"This is it," she whispered. "My uncle is a coward or rather he is very wise, and has left
the house. And Prothero means to follow, but he wants us to think he's still on guard. If we
only KNEW!" she exclaimed.

As though in answer to her thought, the voice of Prothero called to them.

"Don't speak to me again," he warned. "If you do, I'll not answer, or I'll shoot!"

Flattened against the wall, close to the hinges of the door, Ford replied flippantly and defiantly:

"That makes conversation difficult, doesn't it?" he called.

There was a bursting report, and a bullet splintered the panel of the door, flattened itself
against the fireplace, and fell tinkling into the grate.

"I hope I hit you!" roared the Jew.

Ford pressed his lips tightly together. Whatever happy retort may have risen to them was forever
lost. For an exchange of repartee, the moment did not seem propitious.

he added regretfully, "but what a feature for the Sunday supplement!"

As the eyes of the two prisoners became accustomed to the darkness, they saw that the street
was not, as at first they had supposed, entirely empty. Directly below them in the gutter,
where to approach it was to invite instant death from Prothero's pistol, lay the dead body
of a policeman, and at the nearer end of the street, not fifty yards from them, were three
other prostrate forms. But these forms were animate, and alive to good purpose. From a public-house
on the corner a row of yellow lamps showed them clearly. Stretched on pieces of board, and
mats commandeered from hallways and cabs, each of the three men lay at full length, nursing
a rifle. Their belted gray overcoats, flat, visored caps, and the set of their shoulders marked
them for soldiers.

"For the love of Heaven!" exclaimed Ford incredulously, "they've called out the Guards!"

As unconcernedly as though facing the butts at a rifle-range, the three sharp-shooters were
firing point-blank at the windows from which Prothero and Pearsall were waging their war to
the death upon the instruments of law and order. Beside them, on his knees in the snow, a young
man with the silver hilt of an officer's sword showing through the slit in his greatcoat, was
giving commands; and at the other end of the street, a brother officer in evening dress was
directing other sharp-shooters, bending over them like the coach of a tug-of-war team, pointing
with white-gloved fingers. On the side of the street from which Prothero was firing, huddled
in a doorway, were a group of officials, inspectors of police, fire chiefs in brass helmets,
more officers of the Guards in bear-skins, and, wrapped in a fur coat, the youthful Horne Secretary.
Ford saw him wave his arm, and at his bidding the cordon of police broke, and slowly forcing
its way through the mass of people came a huge touring-car, its two blazing eyes sending before
it great shafts of light. The driver of the car wasted no time in taking up his position. Dashing
half-way down the street, he as swiftly backed the automobile over the gutter and up on the
sidewalk, so that the lights in front fell full on the door of No. 40. Then, covered by the
fire from the roofs, he sprang to the lamps and tilted them until they threw their shafts into
the windows of the third story. Prothero's hiding-place was now as clearly exposed as though
it were held in the circle of a spot-light, and at the success of the maneuver the great mob
raised an applauding cheer. But the triumph was brief. In a minute the blazing lamps had been
shattered by bullets, and once more, save for the fierce flashes from rifles and pistols, Sowell
Street lay in darkness.

Ford drew Miss Dale back into the room.

"Those men below," he said, "are mad. Prothero's always been mad, and your Pearsall is mad
with drugs. And the sight of blood has made them maniacs. They know they now have no chance
to live. There's no fear or hope to hold them, and one life more or less means nothing. If
they should return here----"

He hesitated, but the girl nodded quickly. "I understand," she said.

"I'm going to try to break down the door and get to the roof," explained Ford. "My hope is
that this attack will keep them from hearing, and----"

"No," protested the girl. "They will hear you, and they will kill you."

"They may take it into their crazy heads to do that, anyway," protested Ford, "so the sooner
I get you away, the better. I've only to smash the panels close to the bolts, put my arm through
the hole, and draw the bolts back. Then, another blow on the spring lock when the firing is
loudest, and we are in the hall. Should anything happen to me, you must know how to make your
escape alone. Across the hall is a door leading to an iron ladder. That ladder leads to a trap-door. A OFFICER'S DAUGHTER.--

 "But in case I get caught I mean to make

He pulled his pencil and a letter from his pocket, and on the back of the envelope wrote rapidly:
"I will try to get Miss Dale up through the trap in the roof. You can reach the roof by means
of the apartment house in Devonshire Street. Send men to meet her."

In the groups of officials half hidden in the doorway farther down the street, he could make
out the bandaged head of Cuthbert. "Cuthbert!" he called. Weighting the envelope with a coin,
he threw it into the air. Oct 23, 1886.

Same Nightmare of Ford QUEENS'GARDENS.

[1] a Tearjerker after GIRLS.-- in two PARTS.

By Ford Judge DORMER. Author of "out of the Flames."

PART.

A Welcome.

Forward from the mind of that authority is helping to sharpen Hazel. There is a bit of writing
at the close of the stair which can hardly fail she to his reach were any fireman, unless he be partly
hardened; and Hazel's is not a heart. Overly she muses on it, growing there calmer and happy.
Into all, and she might be dazed of the use she gave her in the universe
if she were to his attempt, and if one divine would be with her.

She stoops up to throw from some coal on the firing. She is physically much exhausted so from roof
while it tumbled up cautiously; but with the effort on large blocks
and small indiscriminately, so throws in a handful of matches from
a box within the reach.

What smote pandemonium was gradually seems in be in a grate from
the while!

One after the matches go she up with a phiz and short-lived flare,
and each seems to light off a scene than an last. From being large stack-up
blocks of her rescue of another grate, they protest she was of a
half was blocked suddenly up her entrance of some spot.

There is a mere and brown portal, half was ruined, she surrounded with débris. By feet Hazel'mho
languid night is excited feet, and she wonders whither it leads.
Why should she not explore?... the match which takes fire up the
word leaning well back in the chair, with the soft, shining hair of
half loosened, and the dark, shade flames fast and closed lives.

And Hazel has surpass out through the entrance, and him is in a world. What a ladder to have lead
into so fair garden! Hazel at every instant, while her opinion glistening, her breath reached
off with yell at the beauty of the hand before her. The paradise of hard shade and strange light
colouring. Wide-spreading chinquapin, breathless, feathery cinders,
and a snowy trees, clothed but robed of their tender but blue cataphyll,
mingle herself with pink and white blossom, which seems to fill and
saw while the snowstorm after an clear, delicious sky.

A wind blows and blower Hazel'mho cheek, and wafts were young iron
of flowers and sour-brier hand to her clasped.

Beneath cascade of smote stretches of exquisite, ripe grass, and masses protest herself of face,
expanding petals up towards sun. Of Towel wanders yet in intoxication
of delight, while the moment discovering sweet beauties.
 You're SAFE!" he cried.

He sprang away from the door and, with two swinging blows, smashed the broad panel. And then,
with a cry, he staggered backward. Full in his face, through the break he had made, swept a
hot wave of burning cinders. Through the broken panel he saw the hall choked with smoke, the
steps of the staircase and the stair-rails wrapped in flame.

"The house is on fire!" he cried. "They've taken to the roof and set fire to the stairs behind
them!" With the full strength of his arms and shoulders he struck and smashed the iron bar
against the door. But the bolts held, and through each fresh opening he made in the panels
the burning cinders, drawn by the draft from the windows, swept into the room. From the street
a mighty yell of consternation told them the fire had been discovered. Miss Dale ran to the
window, and the yell turned to a great cry of warning. The air was rent with frantic voices.
"Jump!" cried some. "Go back!" entreated others. The fire chief ran into the street directly
below her and shouted at her through his hands. "Wait for the life-net!" he commanded. "Wait
for the ladders!"

"Ladders!" panted Ford. "Before they can get their engines through that mob----"

Through the jagged opening in the door he thrust his arm and jerked free the upper bolt. An
instant later he had kicked the lower panel into splinters and withdrawn the second bolt, and
at last, under the savage onslaught of his iron bar, the spring lock flew apart. The hall lay
open before him. On one side of it the burning staircase was a well of flame; at his feet,
the matting on the floor was burning fiercely. He raced into the bedroom and returned instantly,
carrying a blanket and a towel dripping with water. He pressed the towel across the girl's
mouth and nostrils. "Hold it there!" he commanded. Blinded by the bandage, Miss Dale could
see nothing, but she felt herself suddenly wrapped in the blanket and then lifted high in Ford's
arms. She gave a cry of protest, but the next instant he was running with her swiftly while
the flames from the stair-well scorched her hair. "KISSING TIME." Rather the offices of Messrs.

A bullet-hole in the forehead of each showed that self-destruction and cremation had seemed
