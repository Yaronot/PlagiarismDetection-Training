Mary visited the continent, and sought health in different climates; but her nerves were not
to be restored to their former state. She then retired to her house in the country, established
manufactories, threw the estate into small farms; and continually employed herself this way
to dissipate care, and banish unavailing regret. She visited the sick, supported the old, and
educated the young.
