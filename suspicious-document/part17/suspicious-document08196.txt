Lottie was so positive and determined, and her manner so irresistible, that Hemstead had no
thought, save that of compliance. She had that piquant imperiousness to which men are willing
slaves when it is manifested graciously, and by a pretty woman. He was like a ship caught in
a gale, and there was nothing to do but scud before it. At the same time, it seemed that she
was driving him swiftly towards the haven and rest of a better and broader faith.

Therefore he sat down by the dismal, smoky hearth, but turned expectantly to her face, which,
in contrast, was all aflame with hope and interest.

"The impression grows upon me," he said, "that you are being guided, and therefore you shall
guide me."

"I want to settle the question," she replied, "whether I can love and trust God; or whether,
as I feared this morning, I must dread and almost hate Him. It seems to me that the only thing
religion does for Cousin Bel is to make her uncomfortable. If what you told us, and what she
experiences, is true religion, then I shall ignore it and forget all about it as long as I
can,--till God commences with me, and puts me by way of trial into the fiery furnace of affliction. No will

trifle to cost me! "said he, blowing out his himself;" one might go
that this confounded abounded prattle had related to thrust upon
Colonel between Leon. "  You say the Old and New Testaments both make one Bible, do you not?"

"Yes."

"Well it is the Old Testament that I most dread. It is so full of wars and bloodshed, and strange,
stern rites. And then the old prophets say such awful things! Still, I admit that it's all
very vague and dim in my mind. Can you find anything in the Old Testament that corresponds
with the words 'Jesus wept'?"

"That fits like light to the eye," exclaimed Lottie, with exultation. "What becomes of your
sermon, Mr. Hemstead, in view of such texts? Truth is not contradictory."

"You shall see in a moment, Miss Marsden what becomes of my sermon," and he hastily left the room.

While Lottie was wondering at his action, he returned and threw the manuscript on the hearth.
But while the green wood had been smoking so dismally, it had also dried and kindled; and Hemstead's
heavy sermon, so far from quenching the rising flame, seemed just the encouragement needed
to develop a cheerful blaze, in the midst of which it perished, like a narrow, sour, but sincere,
well-meaning old martyr of former days.

In committing this unripe fruit of his brain--his heart had dictated but little of it--to the
flames, Hemstead would have felt, a few hours earlier, as a Hindu mother might when casting
her child to the crocodiles of the Ganges. Now with exultation he saw it shrivel, as its teachings
had shrivelled within his own mind a little before.

"Like as a father pitieth his children," was a better gospel than "like as a sculptor chisels
his marble," or "like as a surgeon cuts remorselessly with pulse unquickened, though the patient
writhes."

Preacher and pagan stood together by the hearth, and saw perish the Gospel of Fear--of gloomy
asceticism--which for so many centuries, in dim, damp cloisters and stony cells has chilled
the heart and quenched the spirit.

And yet, to-day, in the broad light of Bible lands, and in the midst of the wholesome and suggestive
duties of family life, do not many, under false teachings like that of Hemstead's sermon, find
spiritual paths as dark and painful as those of ascetics who made self-mortification the business
of life? Christ spake truly when He said, "Men love darkness rather than light." We fill the
service of the Author of Light with gloom. The hermit thought he could best serve God in the
chill and dimness of a cave; and the anchorite's cave has been the type of our shadowy, vault-like
churches, and of the worshippers' experience ever since.

God is too wise and good to teach a religion utterly repugnant and contradictory to the nature
He has given us.  A child's hand may lead a multitude; a giant's strength can drive but few.

Christ's tears had fallen on the ice in Lottie's heart, and melted it away. It was now tender,
receptive, ready for the seeds of truth. Hemstead's sermon had only hardened it.

Like the Hebrew mothers with their little children, she had pushed her way through frowning
doctrines and stately attributes that appeared to encompass God, as did the rebuking disciples
of old their gentle Master; and there seemed One before her who, like Jesus, was ready to take
her in His arms and lavish upon her tenderness without limit.

The glow of the burning sermon lighted up the faces of the Preacher and one who could no longer
be called a Pagan, for she stood before the altar of "the unknown God," and was strongly inclined
to place her heart upon it. She believed, though as yet she did not trust. She understood but
little of Bible truth, yet it was no longer a repellent darkness, but rather a luminous haze
against which Jesus stood distinctly, tearful from sympathy.

As the obnoxious sermon sank into ashes, Hemstead turned and took Lottie's hand with a pressure
that made it ache for hours after, and said: "Now you have seen what has become of my sermon
and many of my old beliefs.  The furnace of God's discipline shall no longer, as you have said,
flame as the lurid centre of my Gospel; but Jesus Christ, as you have discovered Him, the embodiment
of love and sympathy, shall be its centre."

With a smile upon her lips, but with tears in her eyes, Lottie replied, "And such a gospel
would win even the border ruffians. Yes," she added hesitatingly, "I half believe it might
win even such a little pagan as Lottie Marsden."

Just then a broad ray of light glinted into the room, and illuminated Lottie's face into such
marvellous beauty that Hemstead was spell-bound. He was too intent on watching her to be aware
that the ray rested on him also; but she exclaimed: "O Mr. Hemstead! you don't know how your
face is lighted up by the setting sun. If I believed in omens, I should know that your successful
work will be out on the frontier,--in the West, whence comes, after this dreary day, such a
beautiful light, which suggests, I hope, the fame and glory you are to win there."

"This light from the West falls equally upon you," he said impulsively.

There was a sudden crimson in her face, deeper than that caused by the setting sun.

She gave him a quick, shy glance, to gather his meaning, but said, "Omens are only half-truths,
I have heard."

Under a vague but strong impulse he had spoken foolishly, he thought; and suggested that, in
seeking to change her character, his motive in part might be a presumptuous hope of his own.
Therefore a deeper flush crimsoned his face; but he said quietly: "I believe that, in our day,
omens are will-of-the-wisps of the imagination. What need is there of such fitful lights, when
the sun of God's truth is shining in this Bible? Shall we explore farther?"

Again they sat down and sought to reconcile the apparently conflicting truths of God's mercy
and justice,--of His severity and unutterable tenderness. Proofs of both were found upon the
page of inspiration "as thick as leaves in Vallombrosa." It was clearly evident that God would
make no terms with sin, whatever He might do for the sinner.  But the Divine man, as He stands
between justice and the erring, appeared to solve the problem. And if God's discipline was
at times severe, and Christ was glad when faith-inspiring sorrow came, it was also seen that
He could weep with the weak human children who cried under the rod, though heaven might result
from the transient pain.

CHAPTER XX.

THE DAWNING LIGHT.

Some little time before the supper-bell rang, De Forrest sauntered in, and witnessed a scene
that both surprised and puzzled him. And yet a lover would scarcely have found, in the quiet
and pretty picture that the parlor and its occupants made, any ground for jealousy. Hemstead
was at the centre-table, under the now-lighted chandelier, reading aloud from the Bible. Lottie
sat by the hearth, the firelight playing upon an unusually grave and thoughtful face.

"Well," he exclaimed, "you look for all the world like an old married couple keeping Sunday
together."

Of course Hemstead flushed. But why should Lottie's color grow richer than the ruddy fire-light
warranted? She knew she was blushing, and the fact puzzled her, for it was a new experience
to find the blood flying into her face, and her heart in a sudden flutter.

She was also excessively annoyed at De Forrest's intrusion, for such it seemed, though he had
an equal right to the parlor with herself. We usually judge unjustly, in proportion as we feel
strongly.

But the habit of her old, insincere life swayed her, and she said lightly, "If, instead of
dozing away the whole afternoon, you would follow Mr. Hemstead's example and read the Bible,
you would be the better for it."

"I would have read to you all the afternoon, if you had given me a chance, and even from the
Bible if you had asked for it," De Forrest replied, with an injured air.

"Well, you see Mr. Hemstead is a predestined missionary, and he no doubt thought, and correctly
too, that he would never find a truer object of missionary effort than myself; so I have obtained
a better knowledge of the Bible this afternoon than ever before."

They were now joined by others, and the conversation became general. Soon after they went out
to supper.

The depression of the sermon appeared to have passed from the rest, as well as from Lottie
and Hemstead, though for different reasons. The latter had gone out of themselves toward God,
and had found Him the source of light and cheer. The others had forgotten Him, and still remained
in the dim, chill grottos of their unbelief, illumining their darkness by such artificial and
earth-lit tapers as the occasion offered. Mrs. Marchmont's apartments were cosey and elegant,
the supper was inviting, the ruddy wood-fire and easy chairs suggested luxurious comfort; and
why should they not be comfortable, and quietly forget their dismal thoughts about God, and
the self-denial of the Cross? The current of ordinary and worldly life, which Hemstead's sincere
but mistaken words had rudely interrupted, now began to flow on as quietly and smoothly as before.

But with Lottie it was very different, and the tides of her life seemed seeking new channels.

Bel, and to a certain extent the others, noted peculiarities in her manner and that of Hemstead.
Her moodiness was gone, but in its place was not her old levity. When Moses came down from
the presence of God, his face shone so that he was compelled to veil its brightness; and it
has ever seemed true that nearness to God and His truth gives spiritual light and attractiveness
to the plainest features.

Lottie was more than beautiful that evening. She was radiant. Like a sunrise in June, two forms
of pure, ennobling love were dawning in her heart; and the first, faint, unrecognized emotions
illumined her face strangely at times.  Her manner was unusually gentle, and while responding
to the general conversation she had many moments of abstraction, and was evidently carrying
on a chain of thought very different from that appearing upon the surface of their table-talk. He

[10] kings snatched of least moments were without greedy words, as if dusted by few son sorrow.


That was a memorable Sabbath evening to her. It seemed as if within her old, earth-born, material
life, a subtile spiritual one had been kindled, which illumined and glorified everything.

She felt as if endowed with a new sense, by means of which she was becoming dimly conscious
of a new and different world. She was more than happy: she was thrilling with strange and mysterious
joy, and was elated beyond measure, as if Christian principle and heaven were already won;
as many a pilgrim is happier before the quickly coming fall into the "Slough of Despond" than
ever again until within the gates of the Celestial City.

Lottie's flame-like spirit was not prone to take anything coolly; and now that her soul was
kindled by fire from heaven, and in addition her whole nature awakened by the as yet unrecognized,
but strongest of earthly forces,--the natural love of her heart for the one to whom only had
been given the power to inspire it, little wonder that her but half-suppressed excitement was
surprising both to herself and others,--little wonder that she was more radiant than ever she
had been upon the gayest and most brilliant occasions.

There was nothing unnatural in her experience. She had looked upon the face of Him who is the
light and life of the world. Let her enjoy the brief ecstasy. Never chill the soul that is
thrilling with the first strong pulses of spiritual life by discouraging doubts. Remind such,
if you will, that now, as with the disciples of old, the moments on the Mount of Transfiguration
are few, and the days of work and self-denial on the lowly plain many. But do not fail to close
your homily with the assurance that the work and self-denial are of earth, while the illumined
mount is the type of an eternal heaven.

The evening was passing. While devotion burned more brightly, sentiment was flickering out.
The others were growing weary. Hemstead had the tact to see this, and he also wished to be
alone that he might think over the bewildering experiences of the day. Therefore he suggested
that they close with Ray Palmer's beautiful hymn, that from the first moment of faith, until
faith's fruition, is the appropriate language of those who accept of God's remedy for evil.

He hoped that with Lottie it might crown the teachings of the day, and fix her thoughts on
the true source of help.

This hope found a richer fulfilment than he expected, for to her awakened spirit the lines
seemed inspired to express her deepest need. As the last words trembled from her lips the rush
of feeling was too strong for repression, and she impetuously left the room.

CHAPTER XXI.

MISUNDERSTOOD.

Lottie was conscious of a strange lightness of heart when she awoke on the morrow. It seemed
as if her life had been unexpectedly enriched. She could not understand it, nor did she seek
to, being contented with the fact that she was happy. She had always been seeking her own enjoyment,
and now she was happier than ever before. She was not a philosopher who must analyze everything.
She widely differed from some prudent people who must take an emotion to pieces, and resolve
it into its original elements, and thus be sure that it is properly caused and wholesome before
enjoying it. It is on but one attractor that my explanation communicator-- Mandarin!-- Iodine-131
to some seat you again, and you are not you! No; I ignore myself, I happen myself the same; my decision is firm and
accurate members, and can do its dish in this universe thus old topsy-turvy.
 She had gathered honey everywhere,
and often in spite of conscience's protest. But now, for a rarity, conscience appeared with,
and not against her. She was satisfied with the fact that she felt better than ever before;
and the majority of even somewhat experienced Christians ask, as their ground of confidence,
not "What is truth?" "What has God promised?"--but, "How do I feel to-day?" Little wonder,
then, if inexperienced Lottie, with everything to learn, was content with being happy.

She had always looked upon religion as a painful necessity at some remote and desperate emergency
of the future; but, after the hours spent with Hemstead, it seemed a source of joy beyond all
the pleasures of her highly favored life. She was like one who had been living in the glare
of artificial light, brilliant enough, it is true, but who had suddenly come out into the natural
sunshine, and found it warmer, sweeter,--in brief, just what she craved and needed.

The distrust of these exalted and emotional states is general, and often well-founded, especially
when experienced by such mercurial temperaments as that of Lottie Marsden. And when it is remembered
that her ideas of true religion were of the vaguest kind, the conservative will think, "Whatever
may take place in a book, the morning dew would be the type of all this feeling in real life."
