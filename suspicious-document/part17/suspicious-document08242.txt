"It was Diego saw it, my Lord, it was not I," replied Jaquez; "I only heard the noise.  Diego
had no sooner opened the door, than he cried out, and ran back.  I ran back too, and said,
'Is it the ghost?'  'The ghost! no, no,' said Diego, and his hair stood on end--'it is a giant,
I believe; he is all clad in armour, for I saw his foot and part of his leg, and they are as
large as the helmet below in the court.'  As he said these words, my Lord, we heard a violent
motion and the rattling of armour, as if the giant was rising, for Diego has told me since
that he believes the giant was lying down, for the foot and leg were stretched at length on
the floor.  Before we could get to the end of the gallery, we heard the door of the great chamber
clap behind us, but we did not dare turn back to see if the giant was following us--yet, now
I think on it, we must have heard him if he had pursued us--but for Heaven's sake, good my
Lord, send for the chaplain, and have the castle exorcised, for, for certain, it is enchanted."

"Ay, pray do, my Lord," cried all the servants at once, "or we must leave your Highness's service."

"Peace, dotards!" said Manfred, "and follow me; I will know what all this means."

"We! my Lord!" cried they with one voice; "we would not go up to the gallery for your Highness's
revenue."  The young peasant, who had stood silent, now spoke.

"Will your Highness," said he, "permit me to try this adventure? My life is of consequence
to nobody; I fear no bad angel, and have offended no good one."

"Your behaviour is above your seeming," said Manfred, viewing him with surprise and admiration--"hereafter
I will reward your bravery--but now," continued he with a sigh, "I am so circumstanced, that
I dare trust no eyes but my own.  However, I give you leave to accompany me."

  Dismissing the reluctant Matilda to her rest, who in vain sued for
leave to accompany her mother, and attended only by her chaplain, Hippolita had visited the
gallery and great chamber; and now with more serenity of soul than she had felt for many hours,
she met her Lord, and assured him that the vision of the gigantic leg and foot was all a fable;
and no doubt an impression made by fear, and the dark and dismal hour of the night, on the
minds of his servants. She and the chaplain had examined the chamber, and found everything
in the usual order.

Manfred, though persuaded, like his wife, that the vision had been no work of fancy, recovered
a little from the tempest of mind into which so many strange events had thrown him.  Ashamed,
too, of his inhuman treatment of a Princess who returned every injury with new marks of tenderness
and duty, he felt returning love forcing itself into his eyes; but not less ashamed of feeling
remorse towards one against whom he was inwardly meditating a yet more bitter outrage, he curbed
the yearnings of his heart, and did not dare to lean even towards pity.  The next transition
of his soul was to exquisite villainy.

Presuming on the unshaken submission of Hippolita, he flattered himself that she would not
only acquiesce with patience to a divorce, but would obey, if it was his pleasure, in endeavouring
to persuade Isabella to give him her hand--but ere he could indulge his horrid hope, he reflected
that Isabella was not to be found. Coming to himself, he gave orders that every avenue to the
castle should be strictly guarded, and charged his domestics on pain of their lives to suffer
nobody to pass out. Kew, dominicus [Matilda--].

"Oh! Madam," said Bianca, "all men use their wives so, when they are weary of them."

"And yet you congratulated me but now," said Matilda, "when you fancied my father intended
to dispose of me!"

"I would have you a great Lady," replied Bianca, "come what will. I do not wish to see you
moped in a convent, as you would be if you had your will, and if my Lady, your mother, who
knows that a bad husband is better than no husband at all, did not hinder you.-- Bless me!
what noise is that!  St. Nicholas forgive me!  I was but in jest."

"It is the wind," said Matilda, "whistling through the battlements in the tower above:  you
have heard it a thousand times." 

Of the is a am is today superabundance. With thy respect to a review, there can be the doubt to its deal

"Do not speak lightly of that picture," interrupted Matilda sighing; "I know the adoration
with which I look at that picture is uncommon--but I am not in love with a coloured panel.
The character of that virtuous Prince, the veneration with which my mother has inspired me
for his memory, the orisons which, I know not why, she has enjoined me to pour forth at his
tomb, all have concurred to persuade me that somehow or other my destiny is linked with something
relating to him."

"Lord, Madam! how should that be?" said Bianca; "I have always heard that your family was in
no way related to his:  and I am sure I cannot conceive why my Lady, the Princess, sends you
in a cold morning or a damp evening to pray at his tomb:  he is no saint by the almanack. Cellaria,

"Indeed! indeed!  Madam," said Bianca, half-weeping with agony, "I am sure I heard a voice."

"Does anybody lie in the chamber beneath?" said the Princess.

"Nobody has dared to lie there," answered Bianca, "since the great astrologer, that was your
brother's tutor, drowned himself.  For certain, Madam, his ghost and the young Prince's are
now met in the chamber below--for Heaven's sake let us fly to your mother's apartment!"

"I charge you not to stir," said Matilda.  "If they are spirits in pain, we may ease their
sufferings by questioning them.  They can mean no hurt to us, for we have not injured them--and
if they should, shall we be more safe in one chamber than in another? Reach me my beads; we
will say a prayer, and then speak to them."

"Oh! dear Lady, I would not speak to a ghost for the world!" cried Bianca.  As she said those
words they heard the casement of the little chamber below Matilda's open.  They listened attentively,
and in a few minutes thought they heard a person sing, but could not distinguish the words.

"This can be no evil spirit," said the Princess, in a low voice; "it is undoubtedly one of
the family--open the window, and we shall know the voice."

"I dare not, indeed, Madam," said Bianca.

"Thou art a very fool," said Matilda, opening the window gently herself.  The noise the Princess
made was, however, heard by the person beneath, who stopped; and they concluded had heard the
casement open.

"Is anybody below?" said the Princess; "if there is, speak."

"Yes," said an unknown voice.

"Who is it?" said Matilda.

"A stranger," replied the voice.

"What stranger?" said she; "and how didst thou come there at this unusual hour, when all the
gates of the castle are locked?"

"I am not here willingly," answered the voice.  "But pardon me, Lady, if I have disturbed your
rest; I knew not that I was overheard.  Sleep had forsaken me; I left a restless couch, and
came to waste the irksome hours with gazing on the fair approach of morning, impatient to be
dismissed from this castle."

"Thy words and accents," said Matilda, "are of melancholy cast; if thou art unhappy, I pity

  Saying these words she shut the casement hastily, without giving the
young man time to reply.

"I had acted more wisely," said the Princess to Bianca, with some sharpness, "if I had let
thee converse with this peasant; his inquisitiveness seems of a piece with thy own."
