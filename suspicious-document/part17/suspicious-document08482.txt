    The following are not bad, but hardly deserve to pass: "Sickness
    and trouble; the lawyer and minister came to help him out of
    trouble." Or, "Somebody was sick; the lawyer wanted his money
    and the minister came to see how he was." A few present a still
    more logical interpretation, but so far-fetched that it is
    doubtful whether they should count as passes; for example: "A
    man and his wife had a fight. One got hurt and had to have the
    doctor, then they had a lawyer to get them divorced, then the
    minister came to marry one of them." Again, "Some one is dying
    and is getting married and making his will before he dies."

(c) What the man was riding on

    The only correct response is "Bicycle." The most common error is
    horse (or donkey), accounting for 48 out of 71 tabulated
    failures. Vehicles, like wagon, buggy, automobile, or
    street car, were mentioned in 14 out of 71 failures. Bizarre
    replies are: "A cripple in a wheel chair"; "A person riding on
    some one's back," etc.

REMARKS. The experiment is a form of the completion test. Elements of a situation are given,
out of which the entire situation is to be constructed. This phase of intelligence has already
been discussed.[74]

[74] See IX, 5, and XII, 4.

While it is generally admitted that the underlying idea of this test is good, some have criticized
Binet's selection of problems. Meumann thinks the lawyer element of the second is so unfamiliar
to children as to render that part of the test unfair. Several "armchair" critics have mentioned
the danger of nervous shock from the first problem. Bobertag throws out the test entirely and
substitutes a completion test modeled after that of Ebbinghaus. Our own results are altogether
favorable to the test. If it is used in year XIV, Meumann's objection hardly holds, for American
children of that age do ordinarily know something about making wills. As for the danger of
shock from the first problem, we have never once found the slightest evidence of this much-feared
result. The subject always understands that the situation depicted is hypothetical, and so
answers either in a matter-of-fact manner or with a laugh.

The bicycle problem is our own invention. Binet used the other two and required both to be
answered correctly. The test was located in year XII of the 1908 scale, and in year XV of the
1911 revision. Goddard and Kuhlmann retain it in the original location. The Stanford results
of 1911, 1912, 1914, and 1915 agree in showing the test too difficult for year XII, even when
only two out of three correct responses are required. Dolores told me about a conversation he had with Miss the master
about me ...

- You see?

Dolores misunderstood. You mom is not brave. And if not, now I find out.

- Do not do it, girl Adelita, no, for the love of God, "replied the
slave so scared, stopping the girl in a chant of her dress.

By itself, or not, you'd better not see me now Miss. Is there a doctor?

- Well, I want to see you alone. Arrange mode. With Dolores'll let
you know.

What do you want Doctor?

- For a tan that have brought the mountain bitten by dogs.

- Bitten
by the dogs!

Adela repeated. Ay! It must be very serious case when they call doctor. If you have torn!
Probably. Those dogs are like beasts. What horror My God! Mateu, said loudly, looking around
him.

Indeed very strange things started out for Elizabeth to the family under whose roof was hosted
and wit as weighted Tinaja.

Keenly interested the fate of the nurse, a former nurse of his young
friend, now banished from the house manor, and moved, horrified at
what he had heard about the slave, bitten by ferocious dogs, all things
unheard of for her, Elizabeth could not hide Leonardo, nor his intense
dislike or their deep emotions.

- What do you have?

What has given you? he asked.

- I do not know, "she said. I feel bad.

- I thought, "continued Leonard, you had affected the tale of wounded
black. Do not be boba. What bet that has not been more the thing?
Do not spend a few scratches? If you knew the nurse would think like
me. Mom can not see it as outrageous. Nor is there they never give
full credit to what they say blacks. Of the high-school pupils 19 per cent failed to pass,
21 per cent of ordinarily successful business men (!), and 27 per cent of Knollin's unemployed
men testing up to the "average adult" level. To find average intelligence cutting such a sorry
figure raises the question whether the ancient definition of man as "the rational animal" is
justified by the facts. The truth is, average intelligence does not do a great deal of abstract,
logical reasoning, and the little it does is done usually under the whip of necessity.

At first thought these problems will doubtless appear to the reader to be mere tests of schooling.
It is true, of course, that in solving them the subject makes use of knowledge which is ordinarily
obtained in school; but this knowledge (that is, knowledge of reading and of addition, subtraction,
multiplication, and division) is possessed by practically all adults who are not feeble-minded,
and by many who are. Success, therefore, depends upon the ability to apply this knowledge readily
and accurately to the problems given--precisely the kind of ability in which a deficiency cannot
be made good by school training. We can teach even morons how to read problems and how to add,
subtract, multiply, and divide with a fair degree of accuracy; the trouble comes when they
try to decide which of these processes the problem calls for. This may require intelligence
of high or low order, according to the difficulty of the problem. As for the present test,
we have shown that almost totally unschooled men of "average adult" intelligence pass this
test as frequently as high-school seniors of the same mental level.

XIV, 6. REVERSING HANDS OF CLOCK

PROCEDURE. Say to the subject: "Suppose it is six twenty-two o'clock, that is, twenty-two minutes
after six; can you see in your mind where the large hand would be, and where the small hand
would be?" Subjects of 12- to 14-year intelligence practically always answer this in the affirmative.
Then continue: "Now, suppose the two hands of the clock were to trade places, so that the large
hand takes the place where the small hand was, and the small hand takes the place where the
large hand was. What time would it then be?"

Repeat the test with the hands at 8.10 (10 minutes after 8), and again with the hands at 2.46
(14 minutes before 3).

The subject is not allowed to look at a clock or watch, or to aid himself by drawing, but must
work out the problem mentally. As a rule the answer is given within a few seconds or not at
all. If an answer is not forthcoming within two minutes the score is failure.

SCORING. The test is passed if two of the three problems are solved within the following range
of accuracy: the first solution is considered correct if the answer falls between 4.30 and
4.35, inclusive; the second if the answer falls between 1.40 and 1.45, and the third if the
answer falls between 9.10 and 9.15.

REMARKS. It appears that success in the test chiefly depends upon voluntary control over constructive
visual imagery. Weakness of visual imagery may account for the failure of a considerable percentage
of adults to pass the test. Visual imagery, however, is not absolutely necessary to success.
One 8-year-old prodigy, who had 12-year intelligence, arrived in forty seconds at a strictly
mathematical solution for the second problem, as follows: "If it is 2.46, and the hands trade
places, then the little hand has gone about one fourth of the distance from 9 o'clock to 10 o'clock.
One fourth of 60 minutes is 15 minutes, and so the time would be 15 minutes after 9 o'clock."
Such a solution is certainly possible by the use of verbal imagery of any type. 

The nurse disappeared in an instant and, before Adela could respond to her mother, appeared Mayoral
on horseback, preceded by his two gorgeous alanos, to give news in an assertive voice of everything
that had transpired. It was this tall man, thin, muscular, with dark skin, black eyes, curly
hair and fully bearded, whose wide whiskers and sideburns which covered both sides of his face until
reaching the corners of his mouth, making it looking even smaller. Even with the wide-brimmed
hat that he always wore, whether around town or in the house, outdoors or indoors, since he often
used the hat to sleep, when he took it off to speak with Don Candido you could see that while
his forehead resembled that of a white man, the nose, cheeks and hands no one would deny they
looked like those of a black man; so tanned were they from the sun. He came armed, like they
say, to the teeth, the tape machete, knife with silver blade or at least it shone like it was, and
the powerful whip, which was made of a segment of wild orange tree,
and was not weapon less terrible by being only forceful.

He began by saying: - Holy night to Don Candido and all your company.

I came to inform you that they have brought Pedro
with some bites.

He resisted and it was necessary to release the dogs. -Who captured
him? asked the Don calmly.

Don Francisco EstÃ©vez and his party gave orders to arrest untamed
blacks. -Do you know where they have captured him?

In the sugar cane plantations of La Begona, close to the mountains.
-Was he alone?

And his companions? Nothing is known of them, Don Candido, and Pedro
doesn't want to say either.

I would imagine it would be necessary to put pressure on him so he
can sing.

That is why I am coming
to Don Candido, so he may tell me how to handle Pedro.

He is very obstinant. -Where is VD.

Don Liborio? asked the Don after a long pause.

In the hospital. -He is that hurt? Not because of that, Don Candido. I have him in the cellar of
the hospital for security reasons, and he hasn't wanted to put handcuffs because of the injuries;
and I figured then he had bad intentions.

His eyes are two red tomatoes, and I've come to arrive at the conclusion
that when the eyes of a black man gets like that, they are up to no
good.

I
told the man that the black man was too enraged.

The man sure is a dog, when I put him in the cellar, he said, -a
man doesn't die more than once, and what -he was already tired of
working for his employer



SCORING. Three correct contrasting definitions out of four are necessary for a pass. It is
not sufficient merely to give a correct meaning for each word of a pair; the subject must point
out a difference between the two words so as to make a real contrast. For example, if the subject
defines evolution as a "growth" or "gradual change," and revolution as the turning of a wheel
on its axis, the experimenter should say: "Yes, but I want you to tell me the difference between
evolution and revolution." If the contrast is not then forthcoming the response is marked minus.

The following are sample definitions which may be considered acceptable:--

    (a) Laziness and idleness. "It is laziness if you won't
    work, and idleness if you are willing to work but haven't any
    job." "Lots of men are idle who are not lazy and would like to
    work if they had something to do." "Laziness means you don't
    want to work; idleness means you are not doing anything just
    now." "Idle people may be lazy, or they may just happen to be
    out of a job." "It is laziness when you don't like to work, and
    idleness when you are not working." "An idle person might be
    willing to work; a lazy man won't work." "Laziness comes from
    within; idleness may be forced upon one." "Laziness is aversion
    to activity; idleness is simply the state of inactivity."
    "Laziness is idleness from choice or preference; idleness means
    doing nothing."

    The essential contrast, accordingly, is that laziness refers to
    unwillingness to work; idleness to the mere fact of inactivity.
    This contrast must be expressed, however clumsily.

    (b) Evolution and revolution. "Evolution is a gradual
    change; revolution is a sudden change." "Evolution is natural
    development; revolution is sudden upheaval." "Evolution means an
    unfolding or development; revolution means a complete upsetting
    of everything." "Evolution is the gradual development of a
    country or government; revolution is a quick change of
    government." "Evolution takes place by natural force; a
    revolution is caused by an outside force." "Evolution is growth;
    revolution is a quick change from existing conditions."
    "Evolution is a natural change; revolution is a violent
    change." "Evolution is growth step by step; revolution is more
    sudden and radical in its action." "Evolution is a change
    brought about by peaceful development, while revolution is
    brought about by an uprising."

    The essential distinction, accordingly, is that evolution means
    a gradual, natural, or slow change, while revolution means a
    sudden, forced, or violent change. Non-contrasting definitions,
    even when the individual terms are defined correctly, are not
    satisfactory.

    (c) Poverty and misery. "Poverty is when you are poor;
    misery means suffering." "Only the poor are in poverty, but
    everybody can be miserable." "Poverty is the lowest stage of
    poorness; misery means pain." "The poor are not always
    miserable, and the rich are miserable sometimes." "Poverty means
    to be in want; misery comes from any kind of suffering or
    anguish." "The poor are in poverty; the sick are in misery."
    "Poverty is the condition of being very poor financially; misery
    is a feeling which any class of people can have." "One who is
    poor is in poverty; one who is wretched or doesn't enjoy life is
    in misery." "Poverty comes from lack of money; misery, from lack
    of happiness or comfort." "Misery means distress. It can come
    from poverty or many other things."

    (d) Character and reputation. "Character is what you are;
    reputation is what people say about you." "You have character if
    you are honest; but you might be honest and still have a bad
    reputation among people who misjudge you." "Character is your
    real self; reputation is the opinion people have about you."
    "Your character depends upon yourself; reputation depends on
    what others think of you." "Character means your real morals;
    reputation is the way you are known in the world." "A man has a
    good character if he would not do evil; but a man may have a
    good reputation and still have a bad character."

A little practice and a good deal of discrimination are necessary for the correct grading of
responses to this test. Subjects are often so clumsy in expression that their responses are
anything but clear. It is then necessary to ask them to explain what they mean. Further questioning,
however, is not permissible. For uniformity in scoring it is necessary to bear in mind that
the definitions given must, in order to be satisfactory, express the essential distinction
between the two words. Language always speaks, and primary Quemao him. I know, but I had never laid hands on
him, and then came from Africa, I think Naiden bloody skin. Well, sir, spends a week in advance,
Pedro Briche were not presented at JILA, and slept at night in the hut. Don Liborio What have
you done? The next day comes and takes him and gives some sotaventao lashes over his shirt, put into
stocks for two days, took command in the field and blew contramayoral veneer. There are persistent.
I told him to give him a good upside down, he feared that high TOA NegrÃ£o. And I saw the results
of the study, with six companions went to the mountains because he was not punished enough. -
do not say? Don Candido said smugly.

And he added, before Moya takes his word: - And what does all that Goyo, guard the road from
the beach? Do not know if you have researched? - What do you mean?

Moya responded promptly.

Pa Primerito that was it. Do not see the door of Don Candido Mesmer found that your spark fresh
traces of blacks who came from the mountains there? Toos but he swore by the saints in heaven who
has seen, heard or felt this time too ANA. Don Liborio was hot and wanted to snuggle against him
a few lashes pa to sing, but I took his head, because I thought it
was going to ask Mrs. Rosa courage to know that my father had castigao
Cayman.

This retail Don Candido walks without healing of those who kept him company, perhaps to avoid
being interrupted in his meditations. Then, suddenly turning to Moya, in short, imperious tone asked
about the mayor. - When I was coming from the pasture, "said Moya,
he was with people cutting sugar cane in the new tomb.

 Remember, first
the large box, then two smaller ones, and each smaller one contains two tiny boxes."

The third problem, which is given in the same way, states that there are three smaller boxes,
each of which contains three tiny boxes.

In the fourth problem there are four smaller boxes, each containing four tiny boxes.

The problem must be given orally, and the solution must be found without the aid of pencil
or paper. Only one half-minute is allowed for each problem. Note that each problem is stated twice.

A correction is permitted, provided it is offered spontaneously and does not seem to be the
result of guessing. Guessing can be checked up by asking the subject to explain the solution.

SCORING. Three of the four problems must be solved correctly within the half-minute allotted
to each.

REMARKS. Success depends, in the first place, upon ability to comprehend the statement of the
problem and to hold its conditions in mind. Subjects much below the 12-year level of intelligence
are often unable to do this.

Granting that the problem has been comprehended, success seems to depend chiefly upon the facility
with which the constructive imagination manipulates concrete visual imagery. In this respect
it resembles the problem of reversing the hands of a clock. With some subjects, however, verbal
imagery alone is operative. Tactual imagery would, of course, serve the purpose as well.

This is as good a place as any to emphasize the fact that the introspective study of mental
imagery has little to contribute to the measurement of intelligence. Intelligence tests are
concerned with the total result of a thought process, rather than with the imagery supports
of that process. Thought may be carried on almost equally well by various kinds of imagery.
As Galton showed, a person can be taught to carry on arithmetical processes by the use of smell
imagery. The kind of imagery employed is the product of slight, innate preferences complicated
by the more or less accidental effects of habit.

We may say that imagery is to thinking what scaffolding is to architecture. The important thing
is the completed building rather than the nature of the scaffolding employed in erecting it.
No one thinks of blaming the ill construction of a building upon the kind of scaffolding used,
for if the architect and builder are competent satisfactory scaffolding will be found. Just
as little are deficiencies or peculiarities of imagery the real cause of low-order intelligence.
We cannot increase intelligence by formal drill in the use of supposedly important kinds of
mental imagery, any more than we can transform a plain carpenter into a Michael Angelo by instructing
him in the use of scaffolding materials such as were employed in the construction of St. Peter's
Cathedral.

This test is of our own invention and has been brought to its present form only after a good
deal of preliminary experimentation. It correlates fairly well with mental age as determined
by the scale as a whole. It was passed by 55 per cent of high-school pupils and by 65 per cent
of unschooled business men. Success in it is thus seen not to depend upon schooling.

AVERAGE ADULT, 5: REPEATING SIX DIGITS REVERSED

The series used are: 4-7-1-9-5-2; 5-8-3-2-9-4; and 7-5-2-6-3-8.

PROCEDURE and SCORING, as in year VII, alternative 2.

REMARKS. The test is passed by approximately half of "average adults" and by three fourths
of "superior adults." It shows no effect of schooling, the uneducated business men even surpassing
our high-school students.

For the higher levels of intelligence, especially, the test is superior to that of repeating
digits in the direct order. It is less mechanical and makes heavier demands upon higher intelligence.

AVERAGE ADULT, 6: USING A CODE

PROCEDURE. Show the subject the code given on the accompanying form. Say: "See these diagrams
here. Look and you will see that they contain all the letters of the alphabet. Now, examine
the arrangement of the letters. They go (pointing) a b c, d e f, g h i, j k l, m n o, p q r,
s t u v, w x y z. You see the letters in the first two diagrams are arranged in the up-and-down
order (pointing again), and the letters in the other two diagrams run in just the opposite
way from the hands of a clock (pointing). Look again and you will see that the second diagram
is drawn just like the first, except that each letter has a dot with it, and that the last
diagram is like the third except that here, also, each letter has a dot. Now, all of this represents
a code; that is, a secret language. It is a real code, one that was used in the Civil War for
sending secret messages. This is the way it works: we draw the lines which hold a letter, but
leave out the letter. Here, for example, is the way we would write 'spy?'" Then write the word
spy, pointing out carefully where each letter comes from, and emphasizing the fact that the
dot must be used in addition to the lines in writing any letter in the second or the fourth
diagram. Illustrate also with war.

Then add: "I am going to have you write something for me; remember now, how the letters go,
first (pointing, as before) a b c, d e f, g h i, then j k l, m n o, p q r, then s t u v, then
w x y z. And don't forget the dots for the letters in this diagram and this one" (pointing).
At this point, take away the diagrams and tell the subject to write the words come quickly.
Say nothing about hurrying.

The subject is given a pencil, but is allowed to draw only the symbols for the words come quickly.
He is not permitted to reproduce the entire code and then to copy the code letters from his
reproduction.

SCORING. The test is passed if the words are written in six minutes and without more than two
errors. Omission of a dot counts as only a half error.

REMARKS. It is not easy to analyze the mental functions which contribute to success in the
code test. Contrary to what might be supposed, success does not necessarily depend upon getting
and retaining a visual picture of the diagrams. Kinæsthetic imagery will answer the purpose
just as well, or the original visual impression may even be translated at once into auditory-verbal
imagery and remembered as such. The significance of the test must be expressed in other terms
than the kind of imagery it may happen to bring into play.

Healy and Fernald describe the task of writing a code sentence without copy as one which requires
"close attention and steadiness of purpose." They also emphasize the fact that the attention
must be directed inward, since there is no object of interest before the senses and since no
special stimulus to attention is offered by the experimenter. Observations we have made on
subjects during the test confirm this view as to the factors involved.

That inability to remember the code as a whole is not a common cause of failure is shown by
the fact that subjects above 12-year intelligence who have failed on the test are nearly always
able to reproduce the diagrams and insert the letters in their proper places. To give the code
form of a given letter without copy, however, makes a much heavier demand on attention. Nearly
all subjects find it necessary to trace the code form, in imagination, from the beginning up
to each letter whose code form is sought. Subjects of superior intelligence, however, sometimes
hit upon the device of remembering the position of the individual key letters e.g. (the first
letter of each figure) from which, as a base, any desired letter form may be quickly sought out.

The test correlates well with mental age, but for some reason not apparent it is passed by
a larger percentage of high-school pupils than unschooled adults of the same mental level.

The code test was first described by Healy and Fernald in their "Tests for Practical Mental
Classification."[77] The authors gave no data, however, which would indicate the mental level
to which the test belongs. Dr. Goddard incorporated it in year XV of his revision of the Binet
scale, but also fails to give statistics. The location given the test in the Stanford revision
is based on tests of nearly 500 individuals ranging from a mental level of 12 years to that
of "superior adult." It appears that the test is considerably more difficult than most had
thought it to be.

[77] Psychological Review Monographs (1911), vol. XIII, no. 2, p. 51.

AVERAGE ADULT, ALTERNATIVE TEST 1: REPEATING TWENTY-EIGHT SYLLABLES

The sentences for this test are:--

  (a) Walter likes very much to go on visits to his grandmother,
      because she always tells him many funny stories.
  (b) Yesterday I saw a pretty little dog in the street. It had
      curly brown hair, short legs, and a long tail.

PROCEDURE. Exactly as in VI, 6. Emphasize that the sentence must be repeated without a single
change of any sort. Get attention before giving each sentence.

SCORING. Passed if one sentence is repeated without a single error. In VI and X we scored the
response as satisfactory if one sentence was repeated without error, or if two were repeated
with not more than one error each.

REMARKS. The test of repeating sentences is not as satisfactory in the higher intelligence
levels as in the lower. It is too mechanical to tax very heavily the higher thought processes.
It does, however, have a certain correlation with intelligence. Contrary to what one would
have expected, uneducated adults of "average adult" intelligence surpassed our high-school
students of the same mental level. I am clean, and no offense ...

     
        10. Because he found ailments against
        me, so I have had by his enemy.

JOB, XXXIV

While at one end of the porch and laid out the scene occurred, took place in the opposite something
quite different. There were lively and interesting group of ladies Ilincheta together with the
two youngest of Gamboa, surrounded by a semicircle of knights that
Galante or admired.

All rise. The women supported their backs on the rail, and outstanding gentlemen Rosa Ilincheta
lips, in short, full of grace and graphic expression, describing the little incidents of travel,
his poor handling part the way, and his own impressions.

Leonardo smiled, clapped Cocco, Mateu the doctor was like pirouettes
and Meneses remained serious jealousy, because it grew with fans of
his beautiful lover.

Adela and Isabella, under the hands, listened and said nothing.

Suddenly someone pulled the skirt Adela out-side of the portico. She turned her face vividly
and saw a good black appearance, dressed very different from that
used other slaves on the farm.

- What do you want? - Asked Adela
pretty scared.

- Your worship excuse me, girl.

It came by your doctor.

(I could not see through the darkness and skirts Ladies' filed.)

-
And who are you?

- I'm the nurse, maid of his mercy.

- The nurse!

Adela repeated surprised.

- Yes, girl, nurse Maria Regla.

And his mercy is not the girl Adelita?

- The same dresses and shoes.

- Ah! cried the slave, gently squeezing the girl's feet, and another could not part of your body.
Heart told me. Yesterday I saw her pass by the window batey of nursing. I was in doubt what my
girl if the girl Carmen and her grace.

Much has changed! How beautiful it has been my daughter, Holy Virgin!

- Heart told me so cute, my daughter, Adela mimicked.

If I am your daughter, if I want so much, Why do not you come to
see me?

I warned you to Dolores.

Why do not you come out to speak?

I have very angry.

- Ay! cried the black.

Do not tell me this girl is killing me ... His beneficence was not
alone.

- No. Went with mom, Carmen, the wife and sister Moya Panchita.

What was so special?

- Pretty girl of my eyes.

- Speak, explain.

- I can not now, my
child.

- What!

You do not think my mom ask his blessing?

- Yes, girl. I, I want the soul, came ... From the point reached
by Ms. de La Habana, I run and throw myself at your feet ...

- Why
have not done so? Who has prevented you?

- Miss it.

- Mom? No, it
can be. You are wrong, you dream, Maria de Regla.

- I mistake not,
nor sleep, Adelita girl. Hopefully! Miss has banned your feet on this
house.

- How come I do not know about that? Who has been with such
a story?

- There was no story, Adelita girl. Many subjects even as low as 9- or 10-year intelligence will answer promptly, "Why,
45 pounds and 5 pounds makes 50 pounds, of course." But this is not sufficient. We proceed
to ask, with serious demeanor: "How can this be correct, since the water itself holds up the
fish?" The young subject who has answered so glibly now laughs sheepishly and apologizes for
his error, saying that he answered without thinking, etc. This response is scored failure without
further questioning.

Other subjects, mostly above the 14-year level, adhere to the answer "50 pounds," however strongly
we urge the argument about the water holding up the fish. In response to our question, "How
can that be the case?" it is sufficient if the subject replies that "The weight is there just
the same; the scales have to hold up the bucket and the bucket has to hold up the water," or
words to that effect. Only some such response as this is satisfactory. If the subject keeps
changing his answer or says that he thinks the weight would be 50 pounds, but is not certain,
the score is failure.

(c) Difficulty of hitting a distant mark

PROCEDURE. Say to the subject: "You know, do you not, what it means when they say a gun 'carries
100 yards'? It means that the bullet goes that far before it drops to amount to anything."
All boys and most girls more than a dozen years old understand this readily. If the subject
does not understand, we explain again what it means for a gun "to carry" a given distance.
When this part is clear, we proceed as follows: "Now, suppose a man is shooting at a mark about
the size of a quart can. His rifle carries perfectly more than 100 yards. - And back to the same subject, said Don Candido annoying. Moya, fine and says what you repeated,
but nothing that convinces me, and I explained the cause, the real and true cause Carabalis
my flight. The worst thing is that I suspect you know something and do not want to say before Mr.
Priest and the Captain.

- Well, for them and for toas that Jesus Christ died, Moya said eagerly kissing the five crosses
that had formed with the ten fingers intertwined, I do not know naitica
more.
However, the subject is not required to know that the deviation at 100 yards is exactly twice
as great as at 50 yards. A certain amount of questioning is often necessary before we can decide
whether the subject has the correct principle in mind.

SCORING THE ENTIRE TEST. Two of the three problems must be solved in such a way as to satisfy
the requirements above set forth.

REMARKS. These problems were devised by the writer. They yield interesting results, when properly
given, but are not without their faults. Sometimes a very superior subject fails, while occasionally
an inferior subject unexpectedly succeeds. On the whole, however the test correlates fairly
well with mental age. And if you leave me also, something plunged here and damned, pardoning my
moo. }No, do not curse for so little," said the priest.

"Register your memory, Moya," said Don Candido, smiling at their
plight.

"The
fact is," he replied after a brief pause, "I do not know what could be
the cause, or what could cause a jewel to go to a black man."

Don Candido said that some were black bracelets, not jewels,
and he willingly said that misuse was the cause of the Maroons.


It would be interesting to standardize a longer series of problems designed to test a subject's
comprehension of common physical relationships. In the first few months of life a normal child
learns that objects unsupported fall to the ground. Later he learns that fire burns; that birds
fly in the air; that fish do not sink in the water; that water does not run uphill; that it
is easy to lift a leg or arm as one lies prone in the water; that mud is thrown from a rotating
wheel (and always in the same direction); that a stone which is flying through the air swiftly
is more dangerous than one which is moving slowly; that it is more dangerous to be run over
by a train than by a buggy; that it is hard to run against a strong wind; that cyclones blow
down trees and houses; that a rapidly moving train creates a stronger wind than a slower train;
that a feather falls through the air with less speed than a stone; that a falling object gains
momentum; that a heavy moving object is harder to stop than a light object moving at the same
rate; that freezing water bursts pipes; that sounds sometimes give echoes; that rainbows cannot
be approached; that a lamp seems dim by daylight; that by day the stars are not visible and
the moon only barely visible; that the headlights of an approaching automobile or train are
blinding; that if the room in which we are reading is badly lighted we must hold the book nearer
to the eyes; that running makes the heart beat faster and increases the rate of breathing;
that if we are cold we can get warm by running; that whirling rapidly makes us dizzy; that
heat or exercise will cause perspiration, etc.

Although the causes of some of these phenomena are not understood even by intelligent adults
without some instruction, the facts themselves are learned by the normal individual from his
own experience. As I dragged my room had only one
desire, which I found collapsed on the stairs. I arrived at my door, even before its opening,
and I was unable to sustain more. Mechanically, I did that no one was in the corridor. feeling that
still retains the last moment was that Madeleine was safe, and I collapsed on the floor. Even there
I went to one or two hours at night, with memories of a gruesome
scene inconsistent.

The bell announced that dinner was ready and had to go down. I moved, his legs were free, but
it seemed as if he were hit in the head. Thank you for paralysis, very real, he felt a general feeling
of great pain, but I do not think about it.
 Ability to pass the test is relatively independent of the number of years
the subject has attended school, our business men showing even a higher percentage of passes
than high-school pupils.

SUPERIOR ADULT, 2: BINET'S PAPER-CUTTING TEST

PROCEDURE. Take a piece of paper about six inches square and say: "Watch carefully what I do.
See, I fold the paper this way (folding it once over in the middle), then I fold it this way
(folding it again in the middle, but at right angles to the first fold). Now, I will cut out
a notch right here" (indicating). At this point take scissors and cut out a small notch from
the middle of the side which presents but one edge. Throw the fragment which has been cut out
into the waste-basket or under the table. Leave the folded paper exposed to view, but pressed
flat against the table. Was ringing with unparalleled persistent
about it, urging his fellow citizens to study science, which put face to face with the religious
precept. It was "a liberal San Pablo," said Joaquín V. Gonzalez with over success.
 Draw lines to show the creases in the paper
and show what results from the cutting."

The subject is not permitted to fold the second sheet, but must solve the problem by the imagination
unaided.

Note that we do not say, "Draw the holes," as this would inform the subject that more than
one hole is expected.

SCORING. The test is passed if the creases in the paper are properly represented, if the holes
are drawn in the correct number, and if they are located correctly, that is, both on the same
crease and each about halfway between the center of the paper and the side. Look, her come the carts
with the latest rods with which to test the machine!... But look yonder, see the herdsmen
with their mules? And further still, on the other avenue, now I see Don Liborio. With my
cane I cover their dogs, and I cannot say if they are alone, or with
people. The subject must first
be able to construct in imagination the creases which result from the folding, and secondly,
to picture the effects of the cutting as regards number of holes and their location. It appears
that a solution is seldom arrived at, even in the case of college students, by logical mathematical
thinking. Our unschooled subjects even succeeded somewhat better than high-school and college
students of the same mental level.

Binet placed this test in year XIII of the 1908 scale, but shifted it to the adult group in
the 1911 revision. Goddard retains it in the adult group, while Kuhlmann places it in year XV.
There have also been certain variations in the procedure employed. 

In accordance with the doctrine of the atonement of sin through suffering, and rejection of pagan
customs, the dirt has been built on religious basis, and later established
bathrooms Muhammad as a religious practice.

SUPERIOR ADULT, 3: REPEATING EIGHT DIGITS

PROCEDURE and SCORING, the same as in previous tests with digits reversed. The series used
are: 7-2-5-3-4-8-9-6; 4-9-8-5-3-7-6-2; and 8-3-7-9-5-4-8-2.

Guard against rhythm and grouping in reading the digits and do not give warning as to the number
to be given.
