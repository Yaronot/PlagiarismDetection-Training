=====================NOTICE*===================

You have recently purchased some of my earlier writings, hence the following suggestion:

As my regular readers know, I do not favor the use of protein and starchy foods in the same
meal. The only exceptions that I ever made to this combination was the use of potatoes with
meat in the same meal and the serving of milk with starch. I still allow the occasional use
of potatoes with meat for well people, for the potash content of the potato helps with the
digestion of these two foods. But the combination of milk with starch I discontinued some years
ago.

In some of my former writings this correction has not yet been made, therefore we are asking
our readers to keep this in mind when studying those particular works. Where you find milk
in combination with starch, change the milk to teakettle tea, which means hot water with a
little cream (which is fat, not protein) and a small amount of sugar.

THE ROAD OF ILL HEALTH

To understand the cause of appendicitis we must go back to the beginning, and when we do we
find that it starts just where all diseases start, namely, where health leaves off! When the
laws of health are broken for the first time, it can be said that the individual has started
on the road of ill health. How fast he will travel and just what will be the character of the
disease he meets with will depend upon his constitution, inheritance, environment and education.

APPENDICITIS

CHAPTER I.

This cut represents the back view of the cecum, the appendix, a part of the ascending colon,
and the lower part of the ileum, with the arterial supply to these parts.

"A, ileo-colic artery; B and F, posterior cecal artery; C, appendicular artery; E, appendicular
artery for free end; H, artery for basal end of appendix; 1, ascending or right colon; 2, external
sacculus of the cecum; 3, appendix; 6, ileum; D, arteries on the dorsal surface of the ileum."--Byron
Robinson.

The reader will see how very much like a blind pouch the cecum is, 2. The ileum, 6, opens into
the cecum, all of the bowel below the opening being cecum, the opening of the appendix, 3,
is in the lower part of the cecum.

The arterial supply to these parts is great enough to get them into trouble in those people
who are imprudent eaters, and it is also great enough to save the parts when diseased if the
patient has the proper treatment.

For the benefit of the lay reader I will say that the blood-vessels represented in the cut
are the arteries; there are also veins, nerves, and lymphatics imbedded in the folds of the
peritoneum, accompanying and paralleling the arteries, but they are not shown in the cut.

The peritoneum is the lining membrane of the peritoneal cavity. It is well to remember that
there is nothing in the peritoneal cavity except a little serum. The layman will say that the
bowels are in this cavity, but they are not; they project into the cavity, and their outside
covering is the lining membrane of the peritoneal cavity, but they are truly on the outside
of the cavity, and to enable the layman to understand the anatomy so that he can apply it when
reading of the disease, I shall describe the course of an ulcer: If an ulcer starts in the
bowel it first eats through the mucous coat which is the lining membrane of the bowel then
through the submucous coat, which is the second layer or coat of the bowel, then through the
muscular coat, which is the third layer of the bowel; this brings the ulcer to the serous coat
or peritoneum. When the peritoneum is eaten through it is called perforation, for it means
that there is an opening into the peritoneal cavity, and, unless the cavity is cut into, cleaned
and properly drained death will take place in a very short time. I say death is inevitable
without surgical treatment. In this I appear to be more radical than the most radical, for
the best authors have much to say about perforation, diffuse peritonitis, and of patients who
live after perforation, as though it were a common occurrence; I say they are mistaken.

CHAPTER II

History: Appendicitis did not become popularly known until about twenty years ago--not till
it was christened and baptized in the blood of the surgical art. Of course the appendix has
always been subject to inflammation, just as it is now, but in former years the disease we
call appendicitis bore various names, depending upon the diagnostic skill of the attending
physician. Typhlitis and perityphlitis were the names used to designate the disease now covered
by the word appendicitis.

The diseases that appendicitis may be confounded with and must be differentiated from are obstruction,
renal colic, hepatic colic, gastritis, enteritis, salpingitis, peritonitis due to gastric or
intestinal ulcer, enterolith, obstipation, invagination or intussusception, hernia, external
or internal, volvulus, stricture and typhoid fever.

The old text-book description of typhlitis and perityphlitis is so similar to the description
of the present day appendicitis that it is not necessary to reproduce it. The symptoms given
show conclusively that they are really one and the same.

In the surgical treatment of appendicitis the American profession has taken the lead, and the
mention of this disease brings to mind such names as McBurney, whose name is given to an anatomical
point--McBurney's Point--midway between the right anterior superior spine of the ileum and
the umbilicus, Deaver of Philadelphia, and Ochsner and Murphy of Chicago. Those who are interested
in the surgical treatment of the disease can look into the methods of these men, and many others.
The medical literature of the day abounds in exhaustive treatises on the subject of appendicitis
and its surgical treatment.

We are living in an age that will not be properly recorded unless it be entered as The Age of Fads.

Following immediately on the announcement of Lord Lister's antiseptic surgical dressing which
rendered the invasion of the peritoneal cavity comparatively safe, came the laparotomy or celiotomy
mania. When it was discovered that opening the abdomen was really a minor operation, it was
soon legitimatized by professional opinion, and rapidly became standardized as a necessary
procedure in all questionable cases--in all obscure cases of abdominal disease--where the diagnosis
was in doubt. Walwokth., distention, Dilating, 1348, 1358, 1365,. [footnote: Woodcock, Lord,.,.] he damage it,

many years.)

Previous to 1890 the most popular treatment was probably the giving of opium; although this
was far from ideal, "it had the advantage of taking away the patient's appetite, relieving
pain, and putting the bowels to rest."--Ochsner. If there were any way to prove it, we should
find that next to surgery opium is still the most popular way of treating the disease.

To-day there is no other disease which brings surgery so quickly to mind as does appendicitis,
especially if the victim can stand for a good, large fee. It is only human I presume, for surgeons
to defend the operation. They believe in it, and are not willing to investigate, for they are
satisfied. They know or should know that ninety per cent of all the surgery practiced to-day
has no excuse for its existence--no more right to be protected by the laws that weld society
together than has any other graft that exists by the grace of public ignorance and credulity.
This operation has for some time been the largest single item of revenue for the profession.

Thirty-four years ago I was called in consultation to see my first case of what was then generally
recognized as perityphlitis or typhlitis--inflammation of the connective tissue about the cecum.
It was a typical case of what is today called appendicitis. I advised the doctor to cease his
fruitless endeavors at securing relief by giving drugs, and give the patient nothing but water.
As I remember now, it took about four weeks for this patient to recover. This plan--positively
nothing but water--has since been a part of my treatment in all such diseases. I do not mean
by education, school or book education; I mean intuition--that knowledge which evolves from
home life and habits. I mean, has he any self-discipline? Does he know anything about self-denial?
Has he any conception of a control higher than impulse? Has he been brought up to know that
there is a limit to the gratifying of wants and desires beyond which, if he goes, he must make
good with laws that are as exacting as they are invariable? Does he know that nature shows
no favoritism? Does he know that there are laws regulating his intercourse with men--with everything--that
exact absolute justice from him? And that, if he takes advantage of weakness or ignorance because
he can, or if he secures an advantage through credulity or trickery, he must settle for the
crime before a judge who is absolutely just! If he has this education, which is a constitutional
ingrafting from the mother's blood, fructified by a like potential father, he will be almost
immune from all diseases. This is an education that can not be secured unless the individual
has the prenatal and environing influences to differentiate these static attributes of his
nature, and, if he has, the result will be that all these qualities will come to him because
"like attracts like." In an atmosphere where others attract evil this individual attracts good.
The same is true on the physical plane. Those who have diseased bodies always have disease
making habits, hence they attract from a given environment all the disease making impulses,
while those of healthy bodies have health imparting habits, and attract from the same environment
the health impulses for which they have an affinity.

The constitution, inheritance and education of all mankind will vary from the highest to the
lowest types. As we go down the scale from those with ideal physical and mental health, we
see man becoming more and more the victim of disease.

Every step of this evolution shows an increasing toxic state of the fluids in the bowels. After
constipation is established the efforts at securing evacuations are of such a nature as to
irritate the cecum. Drugs to force movement cause painful distentions of this portion of the
bowels. The drugs stimulate peristalsis of the small intestine; each wave from the small intestine
breaks on the walls of the cecum, for the colon is loaded with fecal accumulations so that
the onrushing contents of the small intestine can not be received by the colon; hence the force
of the whole peristaltic impact is spent on the cecum, which must endanger the integrity of
the mucosa as well as the musculature.

This point of the bowels, the cecum is more endangered from diarrhea than any other. The toxic
ptomaines are especially liable to create a local infection if nothing more.

This state of the intestines--toxic state--is a constant menace to health; in fact the organism
is heavily taxed to maintain its defense.

The overcrowding of metabolism, as explained above, the chronic constipation and toxic bowel
secretions, I recognize as the chief factors--the necessary and leading factors--in the building
and maintaining of that constitutional state which I am pleased to denominate Constitutional
Catarrh. When this state is established, it can be said that the individual is ready to develop
any phase of disease that circumstance, accident, or caprice of fortune or environment may offer. 

Else a host in original reflections, none of them very higher moral, flock for--'s to considering
of what other ways our devious allies came by range themselves of the side of that freedom which
they have always be adopted as well and bravely as there any of the
head on us.

The constant dilating of the cecum from gas accumulations and the forced dilations from diarrheas
made either from drugs or irritating foods, must not only damage the cecum but the appendix
as well; for the appendix opens into this part of the intestine and it is reasonable to believe
that it suffers distention from gas and that toxic secretions are driven into it. It was as
if the fairies were busy increases without aerial that watering-pots, to any purpose than at divert
