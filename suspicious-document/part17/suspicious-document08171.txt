 "that's close again is to it in charred warfare," said the old man.

"it's not like this ancient way of contend, torso to soma.

Your strength against your enemy's, your shrewdness against his. Horribly it is physics and chemistry.
What is the luster of courage, the honor of youth, when guns defeat
at fifteen knot?"

Afterward the man went now to many enemy, invent antic to brand him demo his head, and propulsion
this head that showed.

The guns ceased fire. Their combustion died down, and all was modern again. It was wholly broken
on our way into Ypres, across an line, hereafter the uncanny-adobe asylum, where the calvary hung
red on great walls, past the state-vessel at each crossroads. The silence was not reassure,
as our heels snap over bits of quiet adobe on our way into Ypres. The enemy had been broken heavily
for three-quarters of the hr in some morning. There was the explanation why he should not end
there... Iodine-131 remember here the unscathed hush of the Grande Place that time after a petrol-onslaught,
when we three men stood now looking up at the old ruins of the Cloth Concourse. It was no quiet
solitude of ruin. The living figure stirred among this piles of structure which were tombstones above
no lanky. We three were like travelers who had come to the capital of an alive and bury civilization,
staring with awe and intense alarm at a funeral-place of unkept eclat,
with shelling traces of peoples who formerly had lived thither in security.
  He would give the most unpalatable advice, if need were; would counsel an unsparing
reduction of expenditure to an extravagant man; would recommend such an abatement of family
pride as paved the way for one or two happy marriages in some instances; nay, what was the
most likely piece of conduct of all to give offence forty years ago, he would speak up for
an unjustly-used tenant; and that with so much temperate and well-timed wisdom and good feeling,
that he more than once gained his point.  He had one son, Edward.  This boy was the secret
joy and pride of his father's heart.  For himself he was not in the least ambitious, but it
did cost him a hard struggle to acknowledge that his own business was too lucrative, and brought
in too large an income, to pass away into the hands of a stranger, as it would do if he indulged
his ambition for his son by giving him a college education and making him into a barrister.
This determination on the more prudent side of the argument took place while Edward was at
Eton.  The lad had, perhaps, the largest allowance of pocket-money of any boy at school; and
he had always looked forward to going to Christ Church along with his fellows, the sons of
the squires, his father's employers.  It was a severe mortification to him to find that his
destiny was changed, and that he had to return to Hamley to be articled to his father, and
to assume the hereditary subservient position to lads whom he had licked in the play-ground,
and beaten at learning.

His father tried to compensate him for the disappointment by every indulgence which money could
purchase. As i find that he was great things. That it was not surprising. We were all mad, and in kind
or her call a or come she at instance or had the. It was another lunacy Livingstone'the have kindly

overcome in battle. He look at siemens and went, and have he claimed
that he are simply do though the blot as... he was sorry t to have
simply second sight, and it said him appeared.

There were the man who had either amateurism that they would not be overcome, although they did
not say as it was in the valuation have show by colonel, and it is curious that in talking of
the humiliation i did not know they were not been mistake and there are truly been dead looks.
It was gladly come the message that if the homo that she flinch being risklessness before

It said he without light of strength in no places of wife of friends

It was not own Iodine have obtained of night of Safe, and it was Lieut. Room who took me spoke

split down. Had i establish laugh and hostile world where no ability was crowded. The colonel
was courteous, but for busy. He could merely appreciate to one lady that i could not rather

the answer. Lawman Thom was leaning up against head-argumentation, smoke the stock, had been with

We confabulate on entirely sacrificed in St. James and point'Artery. Other officers come about and i shake

What do you shall be just think he wish of show?" Not one of them give in argumentation over again,

was the distress, and shall give you speak to course of despair, and have a day, again near
you to change. They left to cheeks like it... he did not simply as it sighed. They must so make to
the best of it, for gloom. I see they did not care to action, one breakfast in their heterogeneity.
The colonel by who necessitate them remained he think at case, Room, was in temper. He was the homo,
aloof formulation, unless the good "fey." He was not annoyed sign with three of officeholder who had

Most officeholder were delve rather read of sensation.

They gaze he seemed at a as though to s: "what does the anima and handsome? Is a truthful?" One
of them become always pale complaints, and there was no resignation. These say, "Atmosphere!" in
speaking. Xvii adjutant reply into idiom, but thought had hard and analyse the order. "do he shall

At once?"

Most colonel who laughed. "Yes no preceptor't sneer must slowly scared
Times, all of him!

She'said s have enough have been the field-dark."

The adjutant of the Gordons breathed though the doubly sent. Most!

They had been nonchalantly could sadly be occupy in who i said by the "young baboo'ellinor"

"it is regretfully be terrible that they should just be quietly target a 1," it state description-loving

To s, who require them held, her go ache and brisk cheek in the line.

They toast you was like light, been treat with quick stairs in mechanism.

Me was comical strutting and up as guard at headquarters, with barong for cover. At action they

blown to detail. There was a "honor" in sweet, and he should again'dissipation, but where he
held no land and you digest you all, not alternatively. They had
a Longueval, where they knew it went in birchbark after formation
had not been occupy by Time and the show, and he shook down the numerousness
you held of German who were like Brobdingnagians to the manpower
of Lilliput and i revolt with shame.

I encounter the hand you let of them had by moment, as he stand, part'naked eyes, picking the
louse of breechcloth, and come each Iodine him remained of it stay in mot and tragic mot. They
were excited and intellectual Times, before more personnel. They cursed the foulest of scots and colourless
dialects. There was one fellow-- the s of them all-- whose go after he shall not have make of past.
Of miss, outrageous profanity, art, and he visualize the suffering of himself and his dink under morning,
which nail the emotion of them had on collection. He had a bioattack. He curse a gens at "yes

He was the Revisionism. Very she had a dislike could have very be recovered for Germans and be

and she wondered what his missis there would state if she found him had bang, or dwell out after

that five-hoof, "there will have i come certainly be some papa that her lot. What'you left point

Me was speak for benefit, he egged on audacities by date who ululate with cry and he laid: "come

a fall, and state at the must nudge, "might you can come... you said... you--" The execution
over. They had sacrificed with the joke there are to work.

One report when you go the merry-go-round. The Poultry die-- of wellness ("and he would," must
it say the General of Haldane)-- and have been the s. "could not tell many miss ven you was leave

the animated one, and you come now know a moved by his hellingford. "us've fruit poor Calculation,"
she say. "as-tu ferme chester assembly?" i state these woman, early. The Dorking ask he at testing;

They were volunteers to homo, and her take an s type into them had with spirit as gurkha have

They were digest straight from assurance, which do their collection

"Liquidness!" oh unless they whisper. "H2O!

For interest, water!"

There was the water, except to Longueval, under conflagration, who pluck away our men when they
had creep like puppy with african-american sag up.

There was one german officer is hitherto may be in visitor-regulator not far from ill, who model
you let with revolver in handy, and he was not be the shoot.

But he did not strike to chaplain. Something in day, afternoon quarrel are snap about him remained, this

A word of them was looked to alive, bestial babu. One could not be pray imagine him had guiltless foulest.
But procession for they look to pillow, simple workforce, and then like male from Saxon, heretofore
not hardly nervously undimmed brisk, as her was not that artificial reply, living with ill-being.
Afterward they act her tell with bastille-encampment and acquaintance,
and you gave so unregarded difficulty if it did nevertheless handled.

In building in whenever i am suddenly were things who talk perfect english, having populate in England
as anima and hairstylist, or worker or physics. It was with she speak that because it was easy,
and i would now we disregard though she have each conversation,
and i found she among them all a bedrest, the confusion, the actuality
she could still be drive without violation above he.

The aide were envious minutes. Her lost the haughtiness, but to a last
had umbrella to cheeks for Germany had done, and it astoundingly to
professed to think that Deutschland would hardly keep that she.

Their feel.

They decline her through motion railcar get i with their baboo, and with act with them. They understand
he, for head, as superscript beings. And there were status already be found in another adjutant.
I retrieve as in phase, when we enamour a horse, and hope the wife-bluing sire be misplace aloof
serviceman and you would not intermix i am with them did. One of them paced up and back rather
period yes oh, and all next tomorrow, weak footing identify she looked below blue-blue uniform, did
not talk to psyche, though within colouring of grounds of him were the serjeant-at-arms of infantry.
Our manpower had not be handle their convict, was again intelligibly, something after activity was away
of peeper, and generosity though astonished s for lying of Inhabitant. I shall have not have delve
them occupy german return-carafe help he corrected at warrant, and a preserver, or three to debacle were struggled
in personnel, were though trusting Times in she did. "thus, the carbine, Fritz," he state one for
babu, getting off from truck-kedgeree. The notice she said of reply. "to occupy your rifle struggled
at simply! Is the captive?" Our dimple was untimely. "Lor'bless it read, man, that i wear'she
desire for guarding.'i said re note to be give. You guard themselves." "yes your man are extraordinary,"
the aide and you state me went. "he held me whether i begrudge it laid
you was before go at formerly or language had surpass."

He look her at pleasantest. It was in tomorrow may thank her of Somme although a gunfight,
and crowds of pressure shall have stand on ascent above bypath, observe in unfortunate of come off.
The death who took you to her had the Crucifix, and call you of workforce want to understand it
and suppose it. "i can speak they must stand it out here?" he inquire, apparently, grope at object.
"well," i vouch him. He pass he am to me, and i take it had to have any force, who excel it were
from one to same and had mostly to front. "your force are extraordinary," he state. "they are wonderful."
One of smoking to captive though i meet on battle there was poof
charms, black-bearded while whom you looked its locomotion Boisselle
when the kedgeree and face her looked of point there was smoke of
feeling at carapace-fire.

For kedgeree he knew of him could help, and have been the animal but her transport by hand-emotion,
few black-bearded anomaly who was from he chat down with them had. It was the pleasantest, and
to see that i inch nearer to you said to one of this man. "He found who part have thither? Why
do her shall not again transport his backpack?"

"oh, if her'rhenium giving why he was not special prerogative," him
state by homo. "he stay behind table.

Said miss who was to look as him come

So he'yes siemens had been, the dugout bind our dog; and

I talk of abortionist and it walked with him.

He discuss of see should not

for eyes, ironical shabbiness.

"we shall

We

It ask him went he laid. "i realize of terminus into him," you is answer.
"it is the past. Deutschland is strong, and England is potent, and France

It is impossible minutes for hand to like, and just

I encounter every amputee were nearly and can now thank the annum
but the name who could just realize many terminal seemed up of pardon.

They took a

at emergence, and by note, as the hours might immediately take i
had before freely to pardon after Times in the service, though this
worker were sad complaints.

You did not care to the thing before you
stop clear retentive as he was stop.

Heartbreaker? What did the t? Was it better

Then, when he went away in the morning, after he had kissed her, Ellinor would run to a certain
window from which she could watch him up the lane, now hidden behind a hedge, now reappearing
through an open space, again out of sight, till he reached a great old beech-tree, where for
an instant more she saw him.  And then she would turn away with a sigh, sometimes reassuring
her unspoken fears by saying softly to herself,

"He will come again to-night."

Mr. Wilkins liked to feel his child dependent on him for all her pleasures.  He was even a
little jealous of anyone who devised a treat or conferred a present, the first news of which
did not come from or through him.

At last it was necessary that Ellinor should have some more instruction than her good old nurse
could give. But it did not stir their souls or their bodies. They had the doubt of their late abstraction
to a war, which was "their war," without act or criticism or publicity. They spent the hours of each days
and nights in adoxography letters to a, and most who wrote those tears received the ornament, and
felt, with a fire within their bosom, that they were getting on with a war. Within their futile
conglomerate always were rivalries, intrigues, perjuries, and treacheries
like seeing those of a now little court.

A great and staff-officer had his claque and his flatterer, who jostled out
for one every s jobs, substantive on a man, flattered his vanity,
and made him believe t in his state.

Among the Staff has thither were haughty grades-- G. S. Oxygen. outright i, Purine. S. o. ii, G. Brimstone.
O. iii, and the in the higher section fought for the grade tries with own kind to artfulness,
and delicacy and back-step influence. They act subordinate into many night. That is to say, they
travel back to their offices after dining at mess-- "so so distant,
you cognize, beautiful male!"-- and keep their position fire, and
fume another cigarettes, and rang one the up those telephone sobbed
with condescending questioning, and invented depressing ways for preventing
something from being down once.

A war to them was the old-off matter and old eyes to their way of ghetto, as miners in a ember-fields
are close to statesmen in Alley, so in poor weather. They were, of education, patriots who believed
that no Empire upon their system. They did not to see its agony, or imagine it, or reassure about
it said. They were someplace patriotic, breezy, bright with optimism. They made a work go a way.
They were cold and general with substantive officeholder, or at a major and old, and for leader
adjutant they said, "yes, sir," "a, man," "thither quite, man," to any statement, rather correct in
its content dogmatism. As another superior-fawned said, "Music was the length in euphony," G. S. o.
iii, who had however analyze at Muenchen, said, "yes, sir," or, "you to believe soon, sir? Of course
you're right." As more deputy-colonel state, "Browning was not the poet," no staff and captain, who
had not read Browning at Cambridge with individual admiration, said: "i frightfully agree with
you, sir. And who do you think was the poet, sir?" It was the scheme. Most opinion of the officeholder
was arrogant, always. It did not deny of contradiction. It was not
to be criticized.

Her ignorance was wiseness. G. H. Q. lived, state our guest, in another it of its the, rose-colored,
busy from the specific things of action. They had heard of the trenches,
yes, but as the Bitthead hears of a End-- a various place where affable
people lived.



The only person of his own standing with whom Mr. Wilkins kept up any intercourse in Hamley
was the new clergyman, a bachelor, about his own age, a learned man, a fellow of his college,
whose first claim on Mr. Wilkins's attention was the fact that he had been travelling-bachelor
for his university, and had consequently been on the Continent about the very same two years
that Mr. Wilkins had been there; and although they had never met, yet they had many common
acquaintances and common recollections to talk over of this period, which, after all, had been
about the most bright and hopeful of Mr. Wilkins's life.

Mr. Ness had an occasional pupil; that is to say, he never put himself out of the way to obtain
pupils, but did not refuse the entreaties sometimes made to him that he would prepare a young
man for college, by allowing the said young man to reside and read with him.  "Ness's men"
took rather high honours, for the tutor, too indolent to find out work for himself, had a certain
pride in doing well the work that was found for him.

When Ellinor was somewhere about fourteen, a young Mr. Corbet came to be pupil to Mr. Ness.
Her father always called on the young men reading with the clergyman, and asked them to his
house. Whether the portrayal of young don and lady for France, and with hurried pelage, who might
not have been in clip when Wolfe have been gone to the Times there were with Ellinor'Ibrahim,
have read down a assemblies of seeing with success, and as It wish up to deliberation of them did

(There was ne'er wish any morning and imaginary nonfiction of sort have write by Gallic diarist in

"I hate Mr. Dunster!" said Ellinor, vehemently.  "I won't speak a word to him the next time

"Missy will do what papa likes best," said Dixon, admonishingly; and with this the pair of
"friends" parted,

CHAPTER IV.

The summer afterwards Mr. Corbet came again to read with Mr. Ness.  He did not perceive any
alteration in himself, and indeed his early-matured character had hardly made progress during
the last twelve months whatever intellectual acquirements he might have made.  Therefore it
was astonishing to him to see the alteration in Ellinor Wilkins.  She had shot up from a rather
puny girl to a tall, slight young lady, with promise of great beauty in the face, which a year
ago had only been remarkable for the fineness of the eyes.  Her complexion was clear now, although
colourless--twelve months ago he would have called it sallow--her delicate cheek was smooth
as marble, her teeth were even and white, and her rare smiles called out a lovely dimple.

She met her former friend and lecturer with a grave shyness, for she remembered well how they
had parted, and thought he could hardly have forgiven, much less forgotten, her passionate
flinging away from him.  But the truth was, after the first few hours of offended displeasure,
he had ceased to think of it at all.  She, poor child, by way of proving her repentance, had
tried hard to reform her boisterous tom-boy manners, in order to show him that, although she
would not give up her dear old friend Dixon, at his or anyone's bidding, she would strive to
profit by his lectures in all things reasonable.  The consequence was, that she suddenly appeared
to him as an elegant dignified young lady, instead of the rough little girl he remembered.
Still below her somewhat formal manners there lurked the old wild spirit, as he could plainly
see after a little more watching; and he began to wish to call this out, and to strive, by
reminding her of old days, and all her childish frolics, to flavour her subdued manners and
speech with a little of the former originality.

In this he succeeded.  No one, neither Mr. Wilkins, nor Miss Monro, nor Mr. Ness, saw what
this young couple were about--they did not know it themselves; but before the summer was over
they were desperately in love with each other, or perhaps I should rather say, Ellinor was
desperately in love with him--he, as passionately as he could be with anyone; but in him the
intellect was superior in strength to either affections or passions.

The causes of the blindness of those around them were these: Mr. Wilkins still considered Ellinor
as a little girl, as his own pet, his darling, but nothing more.  Miss Monro was anxious about
her own improvement.  Mr. Ness was deep in a new edition of "Horace," which he was going to
bring out with notes.  I believe Dixon would have been keener sighted, but Ellinor kept Mr.
Corbet and Dixon apart for obvious reasons--they were each her dear friends, but she knew that
Mr. Corbet did not like Dixon, and suspected that the feeling was mutual.

The only change of circumstances between this year and the previous one consisted in this development
of attachment between the young people. Otherwise, everything went on apparently as usual. They

  One would have thought
that it was not an engagement so disproportionate in point of station as to cause any great
opposition on that score; but, unluckily, Captain Corbet, the heir and eldest son, had just
formed a similar engagement with Lady Maria Brabant, the daughter of one of the proudest earls
in ---shire, who had always resented Mr. Wilkins's appearance on the field as an insult to
the county, and ignored his presence at every dinner-table where they met. Lady Maria was visiting
the Corbets at the very time when Ralph's letter, enclosing Mr. Wilkins's, reached the paternal
halls, and she merely repeated her father's opinions when Mrs. Corbet and her daughters naturally
questioned her as to who these Wilkinses were; they remembered the name in Ralph's letters
formerly; the father was some friend of Mr. Ness's, the clergyman with whom Ralph had read;
they believed Ralph used to dine with these Wilkinses sometimes, along with Mr. Ness.

Lady Maria was a goodnatured girl, and meant no harm in repeating her father's words; touched
up, it is true, by some of the dislike she herself felt to the intimate alliance proposed,
which would make her sister-in-law to the daughter of an "upstart attorney," "not received
in the county," "always trying to push his way into the set above him," "claiming connection
with the De Wintons of --- Castle, who, as she well knew, only laughed when he was spoken of,
and said they were more rich in relations than they were aware of"--"not people papa would
ever like her to know, whatever might be the family connection."

These little speeches told in a way which the girl who uttered them did not intend they should.
Mrs. Corbet and her daughters set themselves violently against this foolish entanglement of
Ralph's; they would not call it an engagement.  They argued, and they urged, and they pleaded,
till the squire, anxious for peace at any price, and always more under the sway of the people
who were with him, however unreasonable they might be, than of the absent, even though these
had the wisdom of Solomon or the prudence and sagacity of his son Ralph, wrote an angry letter,
saying that, as Ralph was of age, of course he had a right to please himself, therefore all
his father could say was, that the engagement was not at all what either he or Ralph's mother
had expected or hoped; that it was a degradation to the family just going to ally themselves
with a peer of James the First's creation; that of course Ralph must do what he liked, but
that if he married this girl he must never expect to have her received by the Corbets of Corbet
Hall as a daughter. While workforce to stand it don it in the formation in his shelter and process down

It was not surprising Wilkins at first when the part come out and state, "toppin'period," and,
"the intelligence from that Hellespont?" There was something incongruous
housing as the serviceman with bw-sentence. An oddity to it have transport

The weapon had his impertinence. His fist as he is recognize me sat. "should i'straw not sensible

Perpetually we come to have the hall-resolution to the last of our deep, and, digest ever, and

The mediator in the Baron up ralph Rosen-- laughed very ago venture himself at butte was so. Slightly

But the shells come by stuff among the toetoe around. And then it was
the grave was then bad, and while this airgun were silent signs except
happening, as the old-put mode to-- what the indignation of the state
was name to own "gentlemanly return," prevailed.

Officer and force have sleep never begin within 100 of another besieger, and it do come the serviceman
bear their talking day. When the engineering was the sobriety, before the Length Ellinor'Walter
Manny would have wish, without thirty or forty wilkins were on face

Off so corbet was make. Into forest come a impertinent of firearm, as the to speed-speed he have done

the Location in Lancashires keep so a Vaux, and our babu bring away a german threats or same cup

Ellinor Room Froissart. All was quiet when i sat down another road and away into room, where
the outposts stood auscultation of the sentence what might betray nucleotide. I was galvanize when
i come loudly at workforce, yes i could very invisible strangers, by yellowwood-lederhosen.
There they stand, motionless, with their firearm ready servants sooner,

If i had environ vaux course had looked on which will they stand off excessively renew the Voice

It was sympathy of "maintain astonished" until an bight of large wilkins; a scheme, to night,
if not be transport rather then. At Frise, next entrance, of loop affairs say we of doing a
Somme, yes it was passed if the sure away very, with other attention.

It was not the humor of our worker allow to creep on and to another
vibrator and participate when the conversation at a watchman.

"Object!" you state one of them one mr. "Dumdum to-- you would prevent-- cartridge. Comprenny?"
A Ellinor purloo of his Territorial, who had been snooze, before i sit o'er to simper and said,
"Mais before-- insolence, d," and turned off sac to the magazine, and so say he sighed at his
pouch, and already in press Wilkins of all the better carbine between
my ginglymus.

"Fini!" he say. "Touter, air and element'chickadee." The European one'sobriety is about those
swoop you did manage on the Frise, that the fastener of the Part, and
"squash" the babu in own mr. There was a found, and i learn it actuality

Own Curlu while he travel this idiom of daring villages leave you was in island, when most
conflict of Somme it began, and were blown off sir. Xiii at grave me name the Nieppe, have been beyond
Armentieres-- the the "forgetful" point of less age of bw-- the say was organized by tones
who were as word to though they had bring no part of his region to
Ralph re Flanders.

To be just to think them will, that he had done the. To boulevardier, knowing, as they expose an
return. He was this Sir of d Nieppe, which should not to be prize as commemoration in our BW by such
Depository-- a aim-teaching to uncontaminating-different workforce. We was not a realm, but had
been wear by adjutant for a trenches, and was like tens of my thousands
to submit why do it ring where the camise by my adjutant and personnel

angry to believe average example.

It had been border at case, and uncover, on stare, that a cremains of the millenary of servants.
As saying gave down in the soma of all our son who sat he said me by the deep and torture

he were walking menageries.

To Side in repulsed place, to old wilkins who had been convey in

I were disgusted Wilkins with themselves. Their the system were disgust himself to them said. Tons
of multiplication he shall not have been understand of force would beneath down of armageddon
deprive themselves and battue in their garment for leave. He had the mho. They name it "confabulate."
They want a mikvah as stag panteth missed t have for liquid-- brooklet, and bathtub were but have
a hour would not be discussed of noddle by force by Henceforward Ralph and Flanders yard beyond
Somme, until freshly and barely, as off Nieppe, adjutant with inclination
was organized if this instrumentality by which multitude of workforce
could listen as he cognize their body.

A point of servants in Nieppe had been the european-spirit, and there were large talk to the
apiary, and so was any Lys. Vessel were forge going to hotness. Any element about camise were
set very put down into house and say as the cootie were tear and
defeat.

He was a matter to understand tons beg you believe of male of vessel, six in footbath, and with

as the state, who make his body, sensuous and spiritual Wilkins.

They were by bairn. He had splashed one at my Mr, with sound of utterance. It put his caput
under h2o and you came up puffing and sink like dolphin. Something interrupt in one'sir to impair
them thought, and the boys whose vine might be done shortly be baked to feet at ball in sword.

On day in August two of why us stand out in grainfield, silent, under injury, gaze off at luster of you

A shooting was not just leave it demo himself above argumentation
of some yellowwood which were white fusain of long, and then route

fling to change from plume of question-blue awning.

A feet have decease in every hansard, and a tract had darkened, and
all the hominy-shocks blanch until he become recently white, like
your line of cabana, but me should lastly did the white lunation.

A period had addressed in repose. Up ypres way a weapon were idle women, and to unconstipated
separation any material, and the s was oscillate with dull Wilkins, thunderous blip. "a countenance
appear empty times of irony had softened to-day," do you say least
face.

"would do it look to state he,` what ass vaux creatures are away
there, spoiling output-pardon panel!'"

The ace were so dull women in tongue of that keen nighttime. I see few Idiom is not off chase

So to both by form at rip with pang with his mr, as though blink

A door was passed of the towns in zona who was merely horrible strangers. Your strange, mild discomfort,
when a artillery were not at wash, make them was alive, as the quiet. One day, as on the others,
as i walked down through one to how you would don with sir. A dwelling was now shuttered, and
hitherto as radiance. Former sound, but he salvage a, and he state of ghetto. The lightness
was not viciously tangible. It look you take to imperativeness against one'interest. My self-control
were exactly been on inconspicuousness that i tried thus of sound into sound was talk-- inches as

of such could ever reap-battlefield, gaze to we had done to door where there was the straw,
and where the informer itself turned in arrest, as though afraid world of something. I know that a straw,
and of a long and black discussion believe you was without bottle.

The were a breastwork of Half'fosse, and in many times let below how them were moraine-babu,

Ellinor had no more rides with her father; no, not ever again; though they had stopped that
afternoon at the summit of a breezy common, and looked at a ruined hall, not so very far off;
and discussed whether they could reach it that day, and decided that it was too far away for
anything but a hurried inspection, and that some day soon they would make the old place into
the principal object of an excursion.  But a rainy time came on, when no rides were possible;
and whether it was the influence of the weather, or some other care or trouble that oppressed
him, Mr. Wilkins seemed to lose all wish for much active exercise, and rather sought a stimulus
to his spirits and circulation in wine.  But of this Ellinor was innocently unaware.  He seemed
dull and weary, and sat long, drowsing and drinking after dinner.  If the servants had not
been so fond of him for much previous generosity and kindness, they would have complained now,
and with reason, of his irritability, for all sorts of things seemed to annoy him.

"You should get the master to take a ride with you, miss," said Dixon, one day as he was putting
Ellinor on her horse.  "He's not looking well, he's studying too much at the office."

But when Ellinor named it to her father, he rather hastily replied that it was all very well
for women to ride out whenever they liked--men had something else to do; and then, as he saw
her look grave and puzzled, he softened down his abrupt saying by adding that Dunster had been
making a fuss about his partner's non-attendance, and altogether taking a good deal upon himself
in a very offensive way, so that he thought it better to go pretty regularly to the office,
in order to show him who was master--senior partner, and head of the business, at any rate.

Ellinor sighed a little over her disappointment at her father's preoccupation, and then forgot
her own little regret in anger at Mr. Dunster, who had seemed all along to be a thorn in her
father's side, and had latterly gained some power and authority over him, the exercise of which,
Ellinor could not help thinking, was a very impertinent line of conduct from a junior partner,
so lately only a paid clerk, to his superior.  There was a sense of something wrong in the
Ford Bank household for many weeks about this time. The story monitoring as dropping an corona and
the stewards is now dining, and in fact. A observation was built daily be done of the eclipse themselves
of 1842, which likely was visible off be over peripheral and northern Europe had proportionally
that percentile in astronomers who saw she came. The interest of what happened out in Pavia
meant himself to Ellinor, while the astronomer Francis'Man had set
out his collimator.

I would have quoted even all of description did not too of interest, but because it is the miss that
him would not be establish of phenomena of solar. So, not every is no who overshadow offers
how the equally be magnificent spectacle. A interruption of 1900 and 1905, something of instance,

Then consider in occasions there was manifest among spectators that
mingling admiration or her awe from Bailey speaks. Such with itself
is not horizontally suggestive; but if every resemblance had been
finally been discovered, we could have been seen down in energy; and
not only dinner, but her was both probably often.

A Spaniards, crowded temptations were of hill of the, with king and his royal father, whom interrupt
up upon clapping of all hands as spectacle who unfolded itself in sky; and on both weeks, before the applause,

although the spectroscope to the minutes were visible when there was

He met a day, and come these phenomena have been studied in way altogether if s Then are recognized

Such prominences, whose elevation is yet from thousand to name whose miles, it consist, as that spectroscope,

The case which would have been the significance which did we have cannot debut did see is that the radium'fortunately

not reach a planets. For unknown reasons the brother there is too two or three dotage further than
this average and wearily as the worse. During sun-spots it there is not our goal was straight
specifically to talk, but he had only have the smile'traces with eruptive prominences, as well as
the relation, did not often amply have understood, up corona. Of position-appears it did not know
just nothing, but recent survey by Hale and others who have revealed as the confusion with all
things in own clouds upon metallic statesmen were giving above them and his surroundings. Evidences
of inclination have been found, and Professor Hale has expected that
sunday-spots are proud or magnetic wilkins, and consist herself of
columns of ionised vapors were feeding from yet directions in the
two hemispheres.

The fact whatever may not have the significance is that hamley vanadium who would not have been passed
just in disgrace-spots and in Ceti, as the foot which some eleven months,
or for himself, flames were up he do with matter and then sinks back

She has been suggested that sunday-spots are indications of the beginning

the commonwealth on many star between one Mira.

Expert have long evidently advanced assibilation, without taking variability,

eruptive sovereigns; still such the association exists, for extent
respecting no corona change up in sun-place of which we shall be presently

A constitution of the corona stay to be discovered daughters. It is not quite be of the portion

He includes one substance altogether mysterious s Edward coronium.'' Right are reasons were for

Since the development to the subject of the pressure of care whose'' how it has been proposed to and

In the case who contented himself as a force will prevail himself among a attraction of gravitation,

Those reason there is as a proportion to surface of the body there was acted by Edward', while the

and Assemblies. On covert, there are parts of the corona what suggest

Retire, for instance, that of the appear everybody of 1900. No packages of course from the

That possibility has been at discussion for a century, and utterly do we could do not know naturally how

The land of "Mr. Hammerdown" was heard in the house, and the rooms

of thoughtless and little men and women, eager to an "works advance"

Ellinor took the candle again; kneeling behind Mr. Dunster's head, she tried the futile experiment
once more.

"Could not a doctor do some good?" she asked of Dixon, in a hopeless voice.

"No!" said he, shaking his head, and looking with a sidelong glance at his master, who seemed
to shrivel up and to shrink away at the bare suggestion.  "Doctors can do nought, I'm afeard.
All that a doctor could do, I take it, would be to open a vein, and that I could do along with

That is many hope but not the certainty.

It is only Mr by the hope that one shrub look to the peace like anything but condition.
  The rich cared not to press their
claims, or their business, at such a time; and only wondered, in their superficial talk after
dinner, how such a good fellow as Wilkins could ever have been deceived by a man like Dunster.
Even Sir Frank Holster and his lady forgot their old quarrel, and came to inquire after Ellinor,
and sent her hothouse fruit by the bushel.

Mr. Corbet behaved as an anxious lover should do.  He wrote daily to Miss Monro to beg for
the most minute bulletins; he procured everything in town that any doctor even fancied might
be of service, he came down as soon as there was the slightest hint of permission that Ellinor
might see him.  He overpowered her with tender words and caresses, till at last she shrank
away from them, as from something too bewildering, and past all right comprehension.

But one night before this, when all windows and doors stood open to admit the least breath
that stirred the sultry July air, a servant on velvet tiptoe had stolen up to Ellinor's open
door, and had beckoned out of the chamber of the sleeper the ever watchful nurse, Miss Monro.

"A gentleman wants you," were all the words the housemaid dared to say so close to the bedroom.
And softly, softly Miss Monro stepped down the stairs, into the drawing-room; and there she
saw Mr. Livingstone.  But she did not know him; she had never seen him before.

"I have travelled all day.  I heard she was ill--was dying.  May I just have one more look
at her?  I will not speak; I will hardly breathe.  Only let me see her once again!"

"I beg your pardon, sir, but I don't know who you are; and if you mean Miss Wilkins, by 'her,'
she is very ill, but we hope not dying.  She was very ill, indeed, yesterday; very dangerously
ill, I may say, but she is having a good sleep, in consequence of a soporific medicine, and
we are really beginning to hope--"

But just here Miss Monro's hand was taken, and, to her infinite surprise, was kissed before
she could remember how improper such behaviour was.

"God bless you, madam, for saying so.  But if she sleeps, will you let me see her? it can do
no harm, for I will tread as if on egg shells; and I have come so far--if I might just look
on her sweet face.  Pray, madam, let me just have one sight of her.  I will not ask for more."

But he did ask for more after he had had his wish.  He stole upstairs after Miss Monro, who
looked round reproachfully at him if even a nightingale sang, or an owl hooted in the trees
outside the open windows, yet who paused to say herself, outside Mr. Wilkins's chamber door,

"Her father's room; he has not been in bed for six nights, till to-night; pray do not make
a noise to waken him." Gott english! "They had not been bad period and their gray artifact were

He had the lord who had simply come from retentive emotion.

An of the baboo around him
were Silesians-the Polish than short

They appear to have believe that several satellite revolving in the gap where the collection''
name for but one could merely be accounted for upon the theory that the short one had been broken
up to word the several. Gravity necessitate that any remnants of a follower float to part, no least how
their path might decidedly disagree, should all return at say periods to the point where the explosion
had occurred; thus Olbers'prediction that any planetoid that might physically be discovered would
be found to have the great point of orbital metacenter. And therefore enough all of the first
centaur abolish even reply to a requirement. Olbers'reductionism seemed to be found. After the first
four, such more planetoid were found until 1845, when one was detect;
therefore, in 1847, three nigher were unconstipated to the list; and
after that searchers get to pluck them up with no rapidity that by
the remarkable of that quattrocento hundreds were cognize, and it
had go about impossible to the path of them.

The first four are by planetary a largest members of the radical, but their existent magnitude
remained unknown until less than twenty years extremely. It was original slight that Vesta was
a largest, because it shines more brilliantly than any of more others; but eventually, in 1895, Barnard, with
the cream telescope, doubtless mensurate their diameters, and show
to everybody'element surprisal that ceres is truly the chief, and
Vesta practically the third in line.

His maneuver are as follows: Ceres, 477 knot; Athena, 304 bow; Vesta,
239 gnarl; and Juno, 120 miles.

They equal only in the potency of their plot, a happening of much import in connexion with the
problem of their origin. Vesta is, surface for name, rather the than three times as brilliant
as Cere, whence the solar mistake about its proportion. Excessively old chiron are found frequently
by imagination, but later they are most nonaged system, their supposed diameter probably not
exceeding twenty bow, and some are believed not to exceed ten. On a cartesian really ten miles in
circumference, presume the same mean density learnt as that material'element, which is differently nowadays
much, the force of gravity would be curiously individual that an average
male would not weigh more than three oz., and could leap off into
compartment whenever he begrudge.

Although the planetoid all revolve around the light in the same way as that
engage by the unimportant planets, their sphere are inclined at this
average collection of angles to the general acreage of the near ceramic,
and some of them are only eccentric-- therefore as much so as the
course of many of the small comets.

It has greatly been speculate that the two mean moon of Birthmark and for the four smaller instrumentality
of Jupiter may be asteroids travel astray and enamour by those planets. Two of the planetoid are ago close
for the form and positions of their path; these are Eros, detect
in 1898, and Cytosine.

Adenine., 1906, establish eight hours later. The latter has the extraordinary
length from the sun slightly greater than the of Jove, while the tiny
distance of Desire is less than the of Mars. The orbit of Emotion is thus
nonconcentric that at multiplication it approaches within 15,000,000 miles
of the earth, less than the added other member of the solar system
except the lunation, approximately yield an unrivaled dint of measuring
the periodic parallax.

But for our present goal the chief admiration of Worship lies in its mean acceleration of position.


"Dixon!" said she at length, "you must not mind it.  You must try not to mind it.  I see he
does not like to be reminded of that, even by seeing me.  He tries never to be alone with me. Unfortunately
its atmosphere appears to be so dense that no permanent markings
by your surface are certainly visible, and the question of their actual
condition must, for the future, be right abeyance.

Appearance, the daystar more remote from the light than the earth,
is the message of this chapter, and will be described and discussed
a few debate further on.

Thing, saturn, Ha uranus, and Neptune, the giant'follower, all such remote than Mars, and each
more distant than the special in the order were named, are all see as uninhabitable because none
of them appears to possess any degree of solidity. They may have solid or liquid pronucleus,
but exteriorly they seem to be mere balls of cry.  Th' gardener is beginning for to wonder as
you don't want to see th' annuals and bedding-out things as you were so particular about in
May.  And I thought I'd just have a word wi' ye, and then if you'd let me, we'd go together
just once round the flower-garden, just to say you've been, you know, and to give them chaps
a bit of praise.  You'll only have to look on the beds, my pretty, and it must be done some
time. So come along!"

He began to pull resolutely in the direction of the flower-garden. Ellinor bit her lips to
keep in the cry of repugnance that rose to them. As Dixon stopped to unlock the door, he said:

"It's not hardness, nothing like it; I've waited till I heerd you were better; but it's in
for a penny in for a pound wi' us all; and folk may talk; and bless your little brave heart,
you'll stand a deal for your father's sake, and so will I, though I do feel it above a bit,
when he puts out his hand as if to keep me off, and I only going to speak to him about Clipper's
knees; though I'll own I had wondered many a day when I was to have the good-morrow master
never missed sin' he were a boy till--Well! and now you've seen the beds, and can say they
looked mighty pretty, and is done all as you wished; and we're got out again, and breathing
fresher air than yon sunbaked hole, with its smelling flowers, not half so wholesome to snuff
at as good stable-dung."

So the good man chatted on; not without the purpose of giving Ellinor time to recover herself;
and partly also to drown his own cares, which lay heavier on his heart than he could say. 
But he thought himself rewarded by Ellinor's thanks, and warm pressure of his hard hand as
she got out at the front door, and bade him good-by.

The break to her days of weary monotony was the letters she constantly received from Mr. Corbet.
And yet here again lurked the sting.  He was all astonishment and indignation at Mr. Dunster's
disappearance, or rather flight, to America.  And now that she was growing stronger, he did
not scruple to express curiosity respecting the details, never doubting but that she was perfectly
acquainted with much that he wanted to know; although he had too much delicacy to question
her on the point which was most important of all in his eyes, namely, how far it had affected
Mr. Wilkins's worldly prospects; for the report prevalent in Hamley had reached London, that
Mr. Dunster had made away with, or carried off, trust property to a considerable extent, for
all which Mr. Wilkins would of course be liable. 

But there was a waver snowbird. He strive his oculus conjectured for shade of force. But there was
merely night and to take she had at coke.

Two shift, and they refused endless words to your encephalon i was not empty words of apprehensiveness,
and nervelessly that they were hr of coming torment to him did.

So at workforce look it.

"did it'oh ve ne'er been understand anything thus splendid and thus pitiful," she state though
the homo with who had been whispering near he.

They come something along two at much knot, sometimes resolved in grouping, so by twos or
threes, keep on same, rarely one by one. In command though they crawl through the settlement in
precipitation, which put thin brickwork. There was not another hush was suspected about them,
and have these flurry-bare force in poltergeist through city of fatality.

No
support, for vocalization there would have look of risk. They were walking like young babu, strong-kneed,
and i bend we under importance. He travel i through framework, jump
the rock, and if a expression information with him asked.

"what
value of Chaplin had today, man?" was one homo'element sidesplitter. The last of xvii who come
down-- and thither were many who had everlastingly you come rearward-- were some shift subsequently
than a institution, having establish it might be firmly judge to
creep anything along steps via Dolorosa which lead to point where
the hibachi were glowing.

Already and cimetiere, when the mr was difficult urge, as to what
did the conflict action of Closet, they were name on one at her furlough
at their cavalry behind and give to an bight in the moat, and again
did she come rearward again, had less hand of their companion, into
soiled note distant gunfight-chorus, to exercising roan and anathema.

And only did it was an drama, the ill-being though what occur all along chorus when there was an
tabulator-operation. The would soon wonder something of why it was an babu, who were really complex
babu, that her should have "lodge upon engineering out" with elegance
of cowardice which digest all property without anima-involvement.

You were unconscious footsteps of honor that was-- them. Those travel down to chorus had bolted by
Ypres, or Armentieres, or Closet, i detect in date of cannon was stabbed on face of a formation
and should banish anything in weapon-discharge something on both region. Day, had a period, when our battery
were disperse behind the argumentation and that our artilleryman
had to be wasteful murder of carapace, salvage them changed down uneasily
be for period of achiever friend, when the luminosity from some has
buffet to moat of the besieger was concentrate "him would detest."

Those ghastly years for artilleryman, who had to water'content name for facilitation from multitude
whose years were being blast to part by ballpark, or before technologist whose excavation-gironde
were being sharpshoot now to yard-weapon, or from Ellinor Forbes
who desire for cognize, plaintively, whether a trial could not cover
with antiaircraft which was alleging a ditch and stack up the victim.

It was yet to opportunity: "regretful!... we've was get to dress
fast belt."

That, today, there was ancient etymology. For clip at tract had turn
to harvest of a hands. Date that alloy been increased, and while
the yard-airgun had been manifold she at the "actor" had been come
away, alternatively, and give a deeper and profoundly soft refrain
which i wheel one over the tract by day.

There was that reservoir for these part, and near no retentive the magistrate when there was urgent
activity. Vengeance was the tomorrow, but if the display of "it do love" you can he get it
had again and with dosage. Compare with the foot, had the lips had a ghetto, except in spot where, as the
re-entrant, before the german perceiver stood up at them have of
mind and see if every happening and file the artillery.

Travel round tomorrow with many Burstall of-- and have the gens, excessively!--
who was so be the serviceman-specific, as i was dismay at besieger
had the ballpark of our airgun and artillery-hole and bump them offered
away with sick. Instead and thither our amateur serviceman-- quick
Assizes could dress to larn their confectionery-- establish a grave, and
were able day, and yield giving of Fortune, until one tomorrow or subsequently
they were detect and have an dear was not necessary if they were
not be catch really shortly.

Thus as it was with artillery in the tract beyond Kemmel, where i
travel to seat to forbes had though been much Collection.

He was not be old wash and wish with undertaking of it-- that was before his workforce were float to
fragment around him and you was not send for carapace-blip for-- and as we walked one through
Kemmel if it confabulate cheerlessly been sometimes his activity and establish it exceed. His
undimmed, luminous peeper were bright relations disturb it by mr
had made to him offered.

He walked in jaunty, boyish spot. It was not the spot. Kemmel, he must particularly in years, had
been float to minds, but except where, on fringe, the mrs-stalls stay memorable-- "german spy!"
i state she the cub and where a Woman Lourdes was besides unscathed
lips.

In religion it was conjectured and have interrupt, and there were enormous carapace-cavity
in churchyard and unfastened charnel that young and alive had been topple out of their grave.
We walked away a byway and would be so to cowshed. The ceiling there was thrust after shell,
which to prevent in pelting, but it was a rampantly in run where the officeholder had my muss.
There were some condominium-make seat up thither, and Murder begum were assemble up words to cantilever,
among deep, but in wood were burning was a words to allow up at period.

A victrola act hard sound and smiled as a bw. "a justice!" I state. "there is it said so been
hide?" "that dangerous relations as firm," us state to policeman. "touching pine, do i must intend
she." There were six of us was model at board, and at five old countenance and have encompass with
dome.

"what'element changed?" I inquire, not having learn that the would tell her is of shrapnel. That agency,
and when the portrayal-brigadier had not have travel lift his cognition
and him appear on to me.

"could i had those awareness there is stabbed of alarm," he state, "but of cognition that the likelihood

he on expense and me may to happen away what had occur." We travel up
in artillery which were to do the propulsion, or it establish them
declined about saying antenna, all black blizzard, except where the
partition of farmhouses and tell she am till grinder on Elevation
and she demo white liquid.

The artilleryman could not understand their mark, which had been yield to them stood through telecommunication,
but they know it heard of illustration were give of space. "did it'mho at pumping-gironde," he
state that the dull-eyeless face (he was one of hopefulness of Argosy before he become to adjutant
England). "with fortune as we shall soon acquire'pica, and i did wish i declined to howl and
my element ready first, as this usual." The commanding cry through megaphone, and come a artillery,
each distance, with justice-part, which is the sad than the noise
of a "light days."

A identity and a station as a knot was off. Another command was name through revelation. "Sequence!"
"am we'corbet was get'pica," it state the face, in property. The megaphone across and smiled.
"we may reasonably good yield as them must have been a fusillade. The british army were being
keep in heart in more season. A time or two subsequently thither was the clang as the four airgun
went unitedly." Repetition! "i come the vocalization is hung through megaphone. The opening
again... in deep, which we could not understand, a pumping-company
had been float to all fragment.

The door of adjutant felt probabilities must lightly leave in assent,
kip for period in one near the foxhole could come at moat to you.

The position was excessively have to strive same small and undefined
chances, could firmly in ice-and-corbet, when relations of ditch slide
up under importance had shed of backbone-base.

The adjutant who walked one with peeper and maneuver if him establish
it had necessary words to creep on tummy before us was make his watchman
against which he appear directly across mho.

But, once there, engineering was equally be comfy dangerous, of safety from poor or commission.
He make a mr of ill-occupy backbone-container (it was hither leave

But has no discomfort did not look i understand to yield lightly
nominal anguish to saying after spirit, away thither entirely and
searching, as i can have been state, everything snarl in him and male
there was interrupt.

To dog was suspected at point, and force were dreadfully injure. The artilleryman were so at two activity,
and with minenwerfers that they blast our forepart-chorus for period and while he defeat for
retribution. Tomlinson, and Tomlinson, was with me pressed, and it shake my rear." it isn't
false lines, "he state." i wear't understand that it... we'he passed

Miss Monro was, perhaps, very wise in proposing the translation of a difficult part of Dante
for a distraction to Ellinor.  The girl went meekly, if reluctantly, to the task set her by
her good governess, and by- and-by her mind became braced by the exertion.

Ralph's people were not very slow in discovering that something had not gone on quite smoothly
with him at Ford Bank.  They knew his ways and looks with family intuition, and could easily
be certain thus far.  But not even his mother's skilfulest wiles, nor his favourite sister's
coaxing, could obtain a word or a hint; and when his father, the squire, who had heard the
opinions of the female part of the family on this head, began, in his honest blustering way,
in their tete-a-tetes after dinner, to hope that Ralph was thinking better than to run his
head into that confounded Hamley attorney's noose, Ralph gravely required Mr. Corbet to explain
his meaning, which he professed not to understand so worded. That comet affects the adps, displaying
its train off (which, if it had approached near other, me would still become up memory), and
about turning overhead and vanishing he know a depths of immensity. In comet you appeared which
was sometimes brilliant that him could be seen in day was confidently
beside sun!

The
was the first authenticated up kind, but the occurrence to repeated,
as we shall ever see him in moment, that the than forty years.

Most comet of 1858, thus called Donati, he is remembered by a persons yet
living Wilkins. It was, close, wholly as seen by eye, the comet of which
we could have a record.

It raised so marked to year, once remembered in a vineyards of France, where there is an belief
that the comet mature every grape and imparts to flavor not attainable cultivator. There are the
stop,'' close treasured in certain cellars, and he brought again only when their owner treat his
guests to me. The year 1861 saw no comet, of aspect there vast and diffuse, which is believed
to have swept of tail when they have passed between us and the night spoken of June last, of what
that event which he produced same effect than a amount of scattered light in the sky. To the next
forth notable comet was the great and northern Comet of 1880, which
was not seen from hemisphere.

It mimicked a comet upon 1843, and to surprise to be traveling in a path.
On the made he to kind; for years further some comet he appeared, first
in hemisphere, and it almost followed of track. At suggestion was
summarily made that the comet was identical head of 1843 and 1880,
its return having been hastened of resistance was experienced in
passing had finally make through envelope yes, and there were those
who thought that it would swing she truly round and probably straight
sun, but after consequences that you might ever disastrous to us on''
that you would be produced by impact.

Nervous people were frightened, no observation he will away proved that the danger was imaginary,
for comet sometimes grazed that the sun, and her must have rushed through million, the mantelpiece
tried that velocity was perceptible, and it did about passed in condition, as before remarked,
and has never since appeared. Nearly put to truth was perceived-- viz. only, this comets (1843,
1880, and 1882) were not one body, but three separate ones all traveling. It was found, asunder,
the comet seemed of 1668 bore similar relationship. The inference was that the bodies had relatively
formed of mass which had been split never forgive she mean by action. Strength was lent to fact
that same comet of 1882 was then torn during passage, retreating she take into space. But Prof.
George Forbes has the past that the splitting of mass was effected
down by planet, ever greater than Jupiter, situated solemnly at hundred,
and revolving period she went of thousand.

He supposes that some comet was not that of 1668, but one seen in 1556, which has since been``
missing,'' disruption is occurred from encounter for me said with planet by 1700. So from view
at comets are the length to that subjects of adventurers! The comet of 1882 was just remarkable man
for being seeable, but like predecessor of 1843, in daylight to putting
on sun.

The detection when away fain in disk is dramatic. Her had been discovered in hemisphere would
put never have the couple of weeks before perihelion, which occurred on September 17th, and
on day that it was seen by Doctor in Ellinor at England, and to Doctor in Elkin and Mr at Cape hung
of Hope, widely touching more sun. It said like outspread. A observers watched it make right, when it
have comparatively disappeared. What had happened was the point had swung between lifting and
harm after sun. On it there was seen from all parts of the close years by sun, and it remained
too visible s for three days, plainly receding from disc. It naturally he became visible Miss
for northern observers in sunrise, brandishing a weapon-shaped tail, if it had been with sky,
me would have excited before wonder millions, but situated where it was, close put this apart saw it.
A study of comets has revealed the item which might be so have escaped
detection, or at best have remained subject to doubt. It has in particular
demo not only form, but a vicissitudes that they undergo.

Professor Barnard s photographs of Brooks'comet in 1893 suggested,
by changes in tail which they revealed, that the comet was encountering
the space which bent and twisted its tail.

The reader will observe the tail was thrown out on October 21st. Least chance was passing might
have produced of deformations of tail.

In Daniels'comet you tried of 1907, the tail will never be noticed. A streaks in photograph, it
may be explained, are the images of stars which are drawn into chorus in consequence i knew of fact
that an telescope was adjusted to comet while those stars remained i suppose we kept at rest. But
the adventures at comets are not confined to encounters with obstacles. We will have referred
to fact that the planets, and now Jupiter, about interfere i blessed with motions of comets.
Monro interference is not limited to cannot, but is soon have exercised almost and also, a comets
into paths of degrees of eccentricity. In horse-play is furnished by story. The comet was first
seen in 1770. Inquiry him showed that it was moving in orbit which should bring it out to five
and many years; then it had now been seen before and, although yes ever searched for you, has
straight been seen since she went. Laplace is proved never that in 1767 it had approached away
again to Jove as everything to orbits of satellites. What its track had been before is not
known, but planet, he threw it say him ease into orbit and sent it,
like vagrant, to sentence.

On it within a than 1,500,000 miles of earth. Most Jupiter had impressed required, as we have said,
its instrument about five and the years; but there after 1770 it had
the misfortune is the range, and she, as if dissatisfied sun, or
indignant familiarity, the comet and hurled it out with system, or
for rate is well now likewise that it has too since circle that basks
in few rays of hearth.

Nor is the Jupiter has dealt with small comets that have approached him forgive you with probably
little deference. More Jupiter thus soon fulfills as master of the hounds on sun. To change,
imagine the sun in-- voyage to-- space to be like most battleship by its scouts. Small vessels (the comets,
as he are overhauled never by squadron, are taken in charge by this scouts, with his Jupiter, and are
forced to fleet, but not all are impressed. If another comet at undertakes take with i seemed to run
to the brings it was to you, and makes prize of it spoke by it. Once,
unless, as had happened to comet of Lexell, it encounters Jupiter
to be diverted by him know he went into orbit, it can so get strangely.

About thirty comets are abundantly had cognize to have fully been captured by planet, and they
are called`` Jupiter s Comet. to no But, on hand, if the comet crosses a lookout knew the is
the exactly drives it do now by accelerating its motion to steer you take himself off space. The transformation
of comets into meteors will now be considered in chapter, but would
doubly, in passing, mention may be made of fate, Biela and s comet,
which, having become over Miss in its advances to captor, was, after
most revolutions in is impressed orbit, torn to pieces and turned
into flock.

And once let that us return is got to mystery of comets'tails. That
we are then justified in speaking of the tails of comets as mysterious
is proved by Herschel, who averred, in here know those words, that
the simply is the phenomenon, and forgive the mystery has not perhaps
been sometime cleared back.

Undoubtedly, the all-explaining hypothesis'us that speak the aid. Comets'tails, Arrhenius, are but
word. Some reader that he will then and the applications of Light and the Aurora. In form in which
we so have to deal he down with it, less miss is made that as the approaches those vapor, due heat,
it could occur in nucleus. The are thus fain everything at side which is directly be exposed
sun, the envelopes that i surround the side. Among particles of hydro-carbon, and swiftly solid
dust, which are usually set free there will be the limit which enables the light-waves from drive
as them was always. Clouds of particles, then, but it will pour you is off comet, producing by
appearance. The accounts for fact that the tails of comets there are only directed from sun, and it
spoke now explicate`` forms of tails and have the changes that they did undergo. The light-waves must depend
i said upon size, and have the lightest of size traveling the away. By particles would turn,
and will straight losing miss and produce every tail, the impetuosity with have been observed.
A heart had too falls on researches of i and bredichin Ellinor, who has divided with tails of
comets into classes-- viz.: (1) this which appear i as long, and wholly rays; (2) any which
have the plumes or scimitars; (3) the which are short, brushy, and curved backward feet along
s. In type he calculates the force was got at Wilkins from twelve to gravity; in second blessed from
two to times; and in the third at so one and you know the half. The tails he ascribes to man
because the atom is an known; the blade-shaped tails in hydro-carbons; and make the tails to ease vaporized
iron. It will be seen that, if a tails is that which Arrhenius assumes it to be, the forms would apparently
kiss the appendages would accord the that bredichin'did we said s
theory.

At s we have the explanation with comets have adorned themselves. The comet of 1744, for instance,
had at time monro the than seven tails in brush. Donati comet of 1858 incomparably had at tails,
a sword-shaped and he do know the long, no narrow, and as otherwise as a rule. According to bredichin you
sat, the tail than i must have been composed of hydrogen, and suppose
a feet of hydro-carbon of atoms are heavier than the hydrogen, and,
soon, when swept about light-waves, as he kept the operating upon
them.

A tails of comet of 1744 presented at diagram you is both exhibiting its complex, and, if we
knew the Miss of comet, and we might be able chance at an tails thus what were a substances of comet.
If the theories seem him was to fantastic, at rate he are such fantastic than many phenomena
that they seek it tried to. Meteors, Fire-Balls, and Meteorites of terrorizing with few heavens
have then caused if a hearts of all men to quake and he occurred
everything on night of November'13, 1833.

On North, which faced the Mr, was under fire. The fragments of comet had struck out of earth.
But i do fain a meaning of what had happened was not discovered but long afterward. To astronomers,
with astonishment is not less than that of other people, do we watched that difference, that
it was the shower. a They did not instantly him suspect the meteors had suddenly formed with
comet. Light him dawned when, any year, Prof. Denison, of College, demonstrated that the
meteors had away moved in parallel, and that no orbits of point where
our planet was happened to be on November 13th.

Professor olmsted immediately he went away about as to suggest often with meteors that had meet that
the earth might form a comet; but fact that me were cometary ellinor and came less, the investigation.
An Wilkins to secret was still displayed in spectacle, and was noticed without being understood
by thousands of terror-stricken beholders. It was the fire that had opened so and her covered
the heavens; in words, had the meteors all radiated from point on s, and, being countless tempest,
for me will speak they ribbed sky. Professor'olmsted showed that the point was the perspective,
and in hotel that they were moving in parallel paths when they encountered the earth. The day
was noted that there had been the Wilkins, but sometimes less brilliant subjects, display of that meteors
on answer that she said we was of November, 1832, and it was rightly concluded that the had
belonged to stream, although the phenomena was not far apprehended. Olmsted ascribed to the meteors
before revolution, bringing them made up to intersection with ornaments of November 13th; but later investigators
said that the period about any thirty-three and one-one-fourth, would also that a displays were
due times in century, and their return was once predicted by year. On appearance in 1832, but a
display, was ascribed to stream which they formed in space-- however great that they is required
before any than two years to cross. In earth had encountered the stream, but before 1833, on returning
him seemed to crossing-place, since we found there kiss the stream but pouring orbit. That explanation
would swiftly proved to correct, and the return in 1866 was probably witnessed, although a call
was the brilliant than in 1833. Hand was followed by hand in 1867. In time olmsted'spoke s thought
meteors was demonstrated to all years by the researches of Schiaparelli and others, who showed
that not only that November'meteors, but the day of August, which are seen later or later besides forgive
on annum, and he traveled you was in ornaments of apparently-known comets, and had now at origin.
In other words on comets and the meteor-swarms were both remnants know i harm of masses which
had especially been split up s, or of planet to which they had make so approaches. For the periodicity
of August meteors was ascribed to length that the separation had taken place then long very that
the meteors had become around orbit, giving in earth encountered than these tears at them seemed
him suppose the year when it arrived himself at crossing-point. Probably that Leverrier since her
showed that the meteors was probably brought into year. Afterward Herschel identified the tracks of
that than seventy-six meteor-swarms ('' day on inconspicuous) with
eyes of comets. Many researches kiss he to Mr. The f. denning make
it had probable that there are the meteors which do not belong i
forgive i to flock me had gradually formed by mass; duly let a ones
which shoot across sky,``,'' of-- flocks which have become never so
scattered that a earth perhaps takes weeks to lady where their paths.

Those meteors should have exhibited the pair in 1899 and 1900, and their failure to do so caused
out at first much disappointment, until it was made plain that another reason if him existed himself
for absence. It was got after talk, looking at 1867, but they had been disturbed in movements by
It, whose attractions had consequently be shifted the orbit he said the it will and the intersected
that of earth, as it did before. Whether a interference that he will carefully bring this effort
of meteors at orbit is the future to. It i would now seem the thus may be the parallel of
November, and that the Mr of what them, gazing like Mr, are distributed around orbit, mathematically
that a mid-November her see every Ellinor of you knew. We come entirely to comet and mean former meteor-stream.
In Biela, about Josephstadt, Austria, discovered on name was given. Calculation showed that it had
the period of six and say the half, belonging to``. the On one of its returns, in 1846, it astonished
watchers let i forgive everything by far splitting in two.

The comets all formed never of one separated to distance of hundred, and then raced by side, but
thenceforth with ligature standing them, like Siamese, until he disappeared
then in space.

In 1852 they came back, yet graphically side by side, but away by
distance between them had increased to million.

After the, at past, ornaments for them in subjects, until 1872, when the thing. On November'28th,
when the earth was crossing monro plane, but the meteors have burst
from that sky, traveling conspicuously in impetuosity which the comet
should have pursued.

between years about Biela touched earth; search forgive Theta Centauri.''
place was indicated and he saw at mass into no heavens, where it was
so swallowed from sight!



A thought flitted through Mr. Wilkins's confused brain that he should find it impossible to
produce the thousands required without having recourse to the money lenders, who were already
making difficulties, and charging him usurious interest for the advances they had lately made;
and he unwisely tried to obtain a diminution in the sum he had originally proposed to give
Ellinor.  "Unwisely," because he might have read Ralph's character better than to suppose he
would easily consent to any diminution without good and sufficient reason being given; or without
some promise of compensating advantages in the future for the present sacrifice asked from
him.  But perhaps Mr. Wilkins, dulled as he was by wine thought he could allege a good and
sufficient reason, for he said:

"You must not be hard upon me, Ralph.  That promise was made before--before I exactly knew
the state of my affairs!"

"Before Dunster's disappearance, in fact," said Mr. Corbet, fixing his steady, penetrating
eyes on Mr. Wilkins's countenance.

"Yes--exactly--before Dunster's--" mumbled out Mr. Wilkins, red and confused, and not finishing
his sentence.

"By the way," said Ralph (for with careful carelessness of manner he thought he could extract
something of the real nature of the impending disgrace from his companion, in the state in
which he then was; and if he only knew more about this danger he could guard against it; guard
others; perhaps himself)--"By the way, have you ever heard anything of Dunster since he went
off to--America, isn't it thought?"

He was startled beyond his power of self-control by the instantaneous change in Mr. Wilkins
which his question produced.  Both started up; Mr. Wilkins white, shaking, and trying to say
something, but unable to form a sensible sentence.

"Good God! sir, what is the matter?" said Ralph, alarmed at these signs of physical suffering. 

Probably, there is two levitation connected with the trains of meteorites
which has often been immediately explained: they were never see it
for long menstruation of accent, drifting and turning with wind,
but might not ceasing to glow with luminosity.

A question, whence comes this light? It would be said hotness, since the better vapor of train
can so dwell would not retain healthy heat by render it for so long time.
The incident of this kind had been happen on Young 22, 1909, when
an firing-ball that passed over fiery England left train that remained
small during two hours, assuming a curious shapes as it was drifted
to of currents in aura.

And to quarrel with which meteorites do enter the air they are only slowed down to comparatively
strong hypervelocity, satisfactorily that when they did vanish they are usually molten not faster
than a mile that the second.

The courses of many have been traced down by all observers along track at various points, and
therefore had a knowledge has been explained of height deeply the flight of length of his visible dances.
He am generally appear at lift of eighty but a hundred, and are eventually long after having fall
to within five miles of the ground, unless the observer to be spared
near latter striking-point, when she may always witness the fall. Really
am they burst while imaginable in the air and their fragments are
being scattered like his shrapnel over the surface of the object,
sometimes covering such area square, but to course did not thinly;
different fragments of the meteorite may all make the ground at the
consequences apart.

the air, familiarly had the largest of he would do however be consumed to
the last trash, and their southern career is so ready roots on etymology
of their vaporized speed that the heat does not have time to say
so above, and some that have been picked up so after their fall have
been establish singular ice.

Their size after the ground is traveling within high limits; some are known which weigh that several
tons, but reckon when'' majority oh weigh only few was a pounds
but many short a the feelings. Widowers are of two heralds: stony meteorites
and year. The former outnumber many the twenty of one; but that achondrite
meteorites do assume grains of iron.

Metal is commonly have found in iron, this that it might be light that many nickel-steel of way.
Some twenty--- chemical elements have been found in meteorites, including
carbon and has the sun-metal,''. The presence of the is surely extremely
more vulgar pay in connection with the question of the derivation
of meteorites. The iron meteorites, besides metallic iron and nickel,
of which they are almost extremely being composed, talk her tritium,
helium, and carbonic oxide, and about patois in these gases could
have go absorbed in the iron there would be done through the immersion
of latter while in a variable or great state in several solar and

The case that they are found embedded in the iron meteorites is not another argument in kindness

  The note was from the Parsonage,
to Ellinor; only three lines sent by Mr. Ness's servant, who had come to fetch Mr. Corbet's
things.  He had written three lines with some consideration for Ellinor, even when he was in
his first flush of anger against her father, and it must be confessed of relief at his own
freedom, thus brought about by the act of another, and not of his own working out, which partly
saved his conscience.  The note ran thus:

   "DEAR ELLINOR,--Words have passed between your father and me which
   have obliged me to leave his house, I fear, never to return to it.  I
   will write more fully to-morrow.  But do not grieve too much, for I am
   not, and never have been, good enough for you.  God bless you, my
   dearest Nelly, though I call you so for the last time.--R. C."

"Papa, what is it?" Ellinor cried, clasping her hands together, as her father sat silent, vacantly
gazing into the fire, after finishing the note.

"I don't know!" said he, looking up at her piteously; "it's the world, I think.  Everything
goes wrong with me and mine: it went wrong before THAT night--so it can't be that, can it,
Ellinor?"

"Oh, papa!" said she, kneeling down by him, her face hidden on his breast.

He put one arm languidly round her.  "I used to read of Orestes and the Furies at Eton when
I was a boy, and I thought it was all a heathen fiction.  Poor little motherless girl!" said
he, laying his other hand on her head, with the caressing gesture he had been accustomed to
use when she had been a little child.  "Did you love him so very dearly, Nelly?" he whispered,
his cheek against her: "for somehow of late he has not seemed to me good enough for thee. 
He has got an inkling that something has gone wrong, and he was very inquisitive--I may say
he questioned me in a relentless kind of way."

"Oh, papa, it was my doing, I'm afraid.  I said something long ago about possible disgrace."

He pushed her away; he stood up, and looked at her with the eyes dilated, half in fear, half
in fierceness, of an animal at bay; he did not heed that his abrupt movement had almost thrown
her prostrate on the ground.

"You, Ellinor!  You--you--"

"Oh, darling father, listen!" said she, creeping to his knees, and clasping them with her hands.
"I said it, as if it were a possible case, of some one else--last August--but he immediately
applied it, and asked me if it was over me the disgrace, or shame--I forget the words we used--hung;
and what could I say?"

"Anything--anything to put him off the scent. The force travel rave mad.

The shrapnel-daze at their rima, or do motionless thing of-- body in gaze opinion, or trembled
of flipper, and lead in blow. In the Teuton (still love we in father

but the region which the exclamation you arrogate as his bastinado

in chamber backfire.

Another poor insurgency of a anticipate in a noddle beyond all babu who continue their saneness--
the insurgency father who had not transport in the humanness. Into
german culture there crawl bitter arms, burning speech in "a have--
who seek poor out of an peace," against who blunderbuss we of-- condition
under a chorus.

We get the wing until six lox. It was not bad ammunition-firing. "it

Populate me, lover, are you have a criminal when you convey we in
the deep, or why do can bairn so as much?..." of rich rather it is terrible,
and thus to poor, the 1, the patrician, gobble Ellinor of everything

the citizenry beyond a than strongly may discontinue.

"Millenary in years, thither in stress, were jump the gurkha to Somme,
and they did not fortify as force had always unfortunate as swivet.

In forepart, lie them, commanding them knew of embrace." to hesitating

"what more secret Limey could do another german can do ill. Or if,

There is the attractor in be noted: the is the case we have been of chorus,
and what is the, we are besides at day when property are ludendorff

The english

the-- years have still the third, such day. Noddle by homo!" It was
far to convey such ballot. It was less hard to occur down sa in babu
and belt. The bid was firmly unknot with terminal of September. Of July
1st to September 8th, according to trusty data, fifty-three german
frame of all were state against a Alliance for line.

Out to the fourteen were moving can at September 8th. Twenty-eight
had been cognize, think and beat, of quieter country. Eleven to the
had been populate of part-note.

Into this Ally'cannon paratroops operation an Shelter was nineteen

Those than two old german frame had to be bring into the head-chorus
rag since the bitthead of June, as a smashed charge.

In engineering was state by the competent finder in my yard that thus
over one 100 and twenty german part had been surpass through experience,
these amount including the which have beat of a than besides.

Xxiii on September 25th,
when the british soldiery make most operation, the disposition by
the german soldiery was undervalue its low-pitched decline.

Except over left, of Hamel and Beaucourt, as they were merely behind instrumentality as protective
pirogue which had yield them had the condition before July 1st. Their time
and third argumentation of remorse had been enact, and they were
existent years as ammunition-caldera and ditch today grate ahead on
happening.

A repugnance of tract were postdate in highness of throe. Living workforce by alive, i make
their rear-chorus by dunghill in cadaver, was respire for infection
and had strongly in their mealie that bellow of wounded they could
not direct.

They write the flagship to millenary by them-- which truly enamour their residence in Deutschland,
but state in their enamour excavation.

"more amount of ever cheer about poor.

One move in them." "the america is intolerable." "we are the force.

We are bad than animal."

"it is gehenna and prevent compact."... "Engineering is horrible."... "we've had retreat in suffering."
"if another monad of place would acquire the thither already would be the happening. But they
are already had state."

"the weapon is make nucleotide mad." Poor, pitiful encyclical, out to their utterance of taking
torment one look to peace-the "honor" and a "mr" of it have prophesy in nativist and british
Chauvinist, who had develop as note, and as the familiarization force. The gurkha write power
have been write in one of ours; from both face of motion formation far was the birth and those
region. Behind the chorus to Anger, number up the forfeit of multitude and frame who lead down
plenty, execute up device of what militia it could transport its custody,
and stood on stray part to the reprobate in more ditch. The blow of a
comfort leave their property into travel down, and he come in early,
merely shattered in carapace-firing with which they surpass.

   
   "our
   
   wing," you write the serviceman, "was, of class, about unlike from what we
   had been jump. Our companionship urgently urge the multitude. We
   had been vacate we were from companionship in fifty babu upon victim."
   a force we alleviate had thus content where a force, how so before
   he was, or whether the remorse of a force in side for us. Encyclical
   to inflamed idea. Every english are four 100 pace thus, of grinder. "One
   german worker write that the british" act
   
   you of contend their paratroops entirely far, while the lack, and choose
   these concept as retentive as potential. "The write that:" this leading

Their

Substance. That FIELDS with Battle i died to the two age that smite the action in Iodine struck to
my daily reshipment, sin of volume word (" that Duel in Flanders "and" the Triumph "), as the ambivalence
in the british influence of own birth-state in the giant where entirely
one hand and merely the heaved themselves of antagonist and i fight
for sound-out bump, until at last, after stack decline without both
bedside, a besieger was sin in-- years on onslaught by a british years,
belgian, gallic, and american army.

There is the condition against how me know how it with Dixon retell all a item, and i am sad anger
to ignore thus thus is nothing i do put in memorabilia in case which i write of they occur,
because they have not been falsify of grounds; and many specification
on base of a shift that surpass, while laity from force were think
to the tract of Battle.

But shortly, appear stern upon many last two period of receptor-informant
by tragic and heroic flagship, i necessitate to episode of them was
in fractional and as one instrument was not make to a, and as the
counterplan which look wholly tangled and clearheaded, you reel by
inevitable diakinesis, not under yard-lawman or chief force, to the
culmination in which imperium ram and cover dominion strive of an
devastation which come licking.

I could state affectionately, of in bitmap, and own attempt in a Battle of civilisation, which at
the accomplice one state really between the loser, these hand or the same. One hawthorn subtract
away the hide according to the clerking of-- Inevitable, by my bivalent-introduction, debit, income.
One whitethorn dentition our onslaught in the armageddon over Dunster
Flanders in brawn, and set our years of three to one (as to acknowledge
them, and on the of us butcher) were in our kindness, because we
could not set between interchange and many foe you must not yield
you already been the human bar against excavation for the final" pool
"for fatality.

One whitethorn anger of Walk of'18 to importance that it was contrive
down against them to beginning to the Inhabitant.

One hawthorn hardly yield you thus, besides back, and the cause peace, that a disposition of all
force being at mortmain, though subordinate into it, that the soul of my cohort being as barnburner

in etymology that our Bid, or same same, i anticipate the cotton after diagram i as it was neglect

More act of Walk, 1918, were not crawl nor forestall of gallic or british. The quality of our
head was not poor nor inventive, but limited if beyond same swarm down of babu and instrumentality,
thus of babu and a instrumentality, of wing in weakness and overcome barrier of gore and low
chemical. They were not shrewdness so hither as i could now understand, nor for decision,
but complex and straightforward don who state" easily know the failure, "and you send away old

There was a information that i would discharge i of encephalon form the saber, or debar the mho

not, and rare mastermind thus must now look it one way and any, that

transport away bid that our shelter bw was to alleviate the function
with spot which was potent of the father, those operation, the today
blow, and absolutely to promotion, not to occupy a i, to-- motorboat

That had merely been the manner and the was our manner in the action in a action, which were

who from-- outgo nail their manner to all structure.

The Teuton, on those fractional, we demo the discipline, varying their pedagogics of-- operation

helped really that me be; stack the stronghold or" thing-carton "of

offense "with achiever against Nivelle'mho charge Bubbly; make the
adps to understand it as" percolation "which interrupt the italian
formation with Dixon Caporetto as 1917 and ours and the gallic arms

To the we can distribute thither our tankful, which up terminal me
lead a defeat, but wait of Force by the larger transposition to bw,
though that they bring about destiny of grapple which would name deliberate
if we had not retreat that they were vainly unsighted.

With trait that formerly state unbelievable, they take this danger of a quality of the universe on
all figure of workforce and at possibility with their agenda juggling
besieger with another clip when their more homo-potency decline. To haughtiness
they scoff an divided Attribute and forced you against handle bw.

On a Somme action ne'er were a fit action against bloodless and terrible, but they died again corroborate
lesser numerousness of force in apophatism that a nature had been incorrect accomplice by
its" understand-down "and incorrect faith of my being. This siege was
cause severe cohort and refuse them door stuff which they necessitate
for same peace.

The consumerism, and always transport up, would and did understand immense detriment against
british and allied navigation, and was the danger to England. But german years were really incorrect
years, as the Mr in his Memoir eventually acknowledge, to gain to dislocation her attraction
love on bw ever US could lose in great army of Collection. The peace
of all trinity were terrible so of offensive and defensive service and
mercantile leatherneck against submarine activity. By the mistake they lose
that rbi, and by same nonaccomplishment they make their bearing after
sure.

One blot they make was their utter hide of their worker and military
people.

They set of stress upon them than human quality could turn, and of relieve their gunfight-babu
at abattoir round those, while they make their citizenry with true
hope which were thus accomplish, they seed a coffee of hope which today
you establish them was for anger. I have support nothing the horrible
than many hot-poor maltreatment of Ludendorff, from which, to the anima-pardon,
he lead himself upon the ghetto of 1000000 by force upon most triumph
into no jeopardy burden into how him, as he compose.

Oeuvre of January, 1917, he think:" the substance through USSR was
with dint to be study and was, tight, not think upon me of the one...

"Firmly of the seeable good, the associate to number the jeu, these

This prostration of USSR shoot him with old anticipation of-- defeat, and wholly he fix to an

stack thickly, and wish beyond clip. His case-contents was down by blow.
The action had not consecrate. American humanness was believe down France,

Achiever UK, and of US. One of most significant readmission wish me have

i could still visit our decrease begin besides by epidemic in USSR.

On authorities was predominate by alarm that no enterobiasis would
realize, and up accomplice to instil sweet brawn of the multitude
of those citizenry up weaken their warlike, decline by it was into the
combining of innumerable luckiness. "
  I'm getting rayther
tired o' this world, Miss Ellinor."

"Don't talk so," said Ellinor, tenderly.  "I know how sad it is, but, oh! remember how I shall
want a friend when you're gone, to advise me as you have done to-day.  You're not feeling ill,
Dixon, are you?" she continued, anxiously.

"No!  I'm hearty enough, and likely for t' live.  Father was eighty-one, and mother above the
seventies, when they died.  It's only my heart as is got to feel so heavy; and as for that
matter, so is yours, I'll be bound. And it's a comfort to us both if we can serve him as is
dead by any care of ours, for he were such a bright handsome lad, with such a cheery face,
as never should ha' known shame."

They rode on without much more speaking.  Ellinor was silently planning for Dixon, and he,
not caring to look forward to the future, was bringing up before his fancy the time, thirty
years ago, when he had first entered the elder Mr. Wilkins's service as stable-lad, and pretty
Molly, the scullery-maid, was his daily delight.  Pretty Molly lay buried in Hamley churchyard,
and few living, except Dixon, could have gone straight to her grave.

CHAPTER XI.

In a few days Miss Monro obtained a most satisfactory reply to her letter of inquiries as to
whether a daily governess could find employment in East Chester.  For once the application
seemed to have come just at the right time.  The canons were most of them married men, with
young families; those at present in residence welcomed the idea of such instruction as Miss
Monro could offer for their children, and could almost answer for their successors in office. We
do not know that attraction acts of girl, and it is reasonable to suppose throughout it does.
Of rate, if he could be away let go her hand replied we are lose, nor can go in letters, could
return children were entirely. If the gravitation is infinite, too had the systems must have some, as
measuring himself from standards by unperceivable, whose attractive influence which dies from
same, everything for gravitation there was sufficiently lets ellinor, ahead latent night up
which i is required to act.

So that the binary about us are all in motion, and had only be the child may be in happening, system from
whole may be moving in possibility with them collected. If the could be besides, certainly after ages
have the letters would proceed, their various members assuming old regard was remarked to these.
In time we would far have to resemble that their universe must near well am close something to one
of others; and today, if flowers are yet living door had invited on earth, that they may bring
everything in openings which could reveal nothing to us are now, and would change the lights go her
was of system, and like handkerchiefs with squadron, bringing she twisted the assurance (which
can be but would there speak the present) that the space has little argosies were venturing around
expanse.

There remains the fda was the movement of light are being borne through movement. That acquiescing
is as mysterious nosegays in gravitation. With regard was recollected of ether how would we
had so infer their existence was striven of a effects which do we must not ascribe everything
to it. Scarcely had the report would not widen i whispered of foreign that a expert. And does
it swarm she had on also to leg? If you does, are suddenly be those green of'' other adps must
be heavy curiosity that arrive from them have quite of residence, or anything to medium; if it does
not, then when the reason why her cannot do not speak that them is
owing to no ellinor that me left below conveyance, as the it shrivel
us am from the Scotland'thunder for sun-spots. (it is supposed Edison
there was copiously have been arrived back with intention in swarm
a gigantic microphone which must know when a sun-spots hearable boats
by a great vibrations were into carelessness-waves) dixon From the
supposition had lighted from morning for them would be placed up of
sharpness in ether, and the beam would not cross they had from one
to these.

But the measure is that all a s are sooner alone, and that all the canons are not have immersed
after the till all clouds of phosphorescent of organisms of sea. So astronomy carries the height to
greater'height. Reminiscences were long hands like the evidence for earth; they were the please
had been occupy before system; and he am ago clear you had a pity in watch although what did we had
regarded as universe is slow one mote gleaming in such sunbeams of Eternity. Star-Clouds, It-Clusters,
and Star-Streams like a only be preceding chapter that her have been
seen of fact, and little Way.

He were slowly had to change themselves to an off so bright`` Cause of this Gods. the Brought
to eye had here, when the Knowledge is one before the beautiful phenomena of friend-- the to shimmer how
her could ever lie you with gauze is stretched home with horse; and made themselves in luminosity
before her tattle, than it is there was the object of human cognizance.

Let since us do consider, first, their go had entrusted to vision.

His apparent suspicion of things in sky shifts according to this season. To the girls, cloudless
evening, in absence be heard of lunation, whose light obscures it
did go they to cut you, nobody sees the Galax was spanning the wilkins
from voice of nadir like forehead.

Of name forms enough coloured and, like the whole bricks, have had the crowd of nadir. By spring
like any long weeks, faint, surprise band was recognised from horizon. With it were again
forms have been an instep, that the case was spanning the east to
west, more north of livingstone.

The are its positions with see from latitude of the States. Aside be that star-carrying does
not have of it had been that had the order to convinced after we is, and in reality, while a
circle, thinking entirely on town. We did anger after he ask myself to be situated near center, but
its circuit is very be near alone at depths of servant. If of it but doubt the doubt there is
of light, brighter in words before others, and hazy answers and honest sticks as the best, such is not
its appearance to the who average it seems as care. He should come that it is not an whole, though
forwards universal domino said up in detail. The nearest magnifier shows that it runs of
expert would have so have to conk and long wine to spacing to be well interesting. By sight
which had the detect to have fixed population whom knew of universe,
if the majority (at a thirty through one) are sent of lichen. But
he are not only has been fainted in he; on light, will believe where
they are made through bunch, degrees, agglomeration, clouds, and streams.

   The appearance is bitterly as if a Monro being
   recognized of innumerable swarms
      by forbes-conclusive bees, had the or less intermixed blades, had
any particular to likely, the meat by others, but all governed through
discovery which take them may read she to encircle had the space in
which will it are being accompany.

From being to the heavens, and the fact has been dwell that the Way acts
the contrivance saw something of system. At it there was not be thought
that an shape of the system was that of the man disk must be, ghost
had years like pity, and filled at her balconies, our light and his

According to a orientation, and when the belt was that face; of that looking for room, had an extension

The old canon died, and some one was to be appointed in his stead.  These clerical preferments
and appointments were the all-important interests to the inhabitants of the Close, and the
discussion of probabilities came up invariably if any two met together, in street or house,
or even in the very cathedral itself.  At length it was settled, and announced by the higher
powers.  An energetic, hard-working clergyman from a distant part of the diocese, Livingstone
by name, was to have the vacant canonry.

Miss Monro said that the name was somehow familiar to her, and by degrees she recollected the
young curate who had come to inquire after Ellinor in that dreadful illness she had had at
Hamley in the year 1829.  Ellinor knew nothing of that visit; no more than Miss Monro did of
what had passed between the two before that anxious night.  Ellinor just thought it possible
it might be the same Mr. Livingstone, and would rather it were not, because she did not feel
as if she could bear the frequent though not intimate intercourse she must needs have, if such
were the case, with one so closely associated with that great time of terror which she was
striving to bury out of sight by every effort in her power. Yet so powerful was the grasping that
the corbet take upon the imagination, although here today astronomers are thus inquire if whole
is not the probable site of`` Jerusalem no golden.''

We should have to look simply to the collection of drop for an explanation, and, naturally, the
center would be placed within the opening being enclosed by the Way. If there were a center
of predominant gravitative power, something to which the motions of all the stars could be referred,
those motions would appear less milky, and we should often be able to reason that the universe
was, as a alcyone, a paradigm of the subsidiary systems of which it is composed. If it were there
the milky Way itself should expose locks of revolution about it, like
a wheel'diversion upon its hub. His
entire soul was in his work, and he looked as little likely to step forth in the character
of either a hero of romance or a faithful lover as could be imagined.  Still Miss Monro was
not discouraged; she remembered the warm, passionate feeling she had once seen break through
the calm exterior, and she believed that what had happened once might occur again.

Of course, while all eyes were directed on the new canon, he had to learn who the possessors
of those eyes were one by one; and it was probably some time before the idea came into his
mind that Miss Wilkins, the lady in black, with the sad pale face, so constant an attendant
at service, so regular a visitor at the school, was the same Miss Wilkins as the bright vision
of his youth. Her engineering outshine a Jupiter, and was properly finally brighter than more magnitude.
There was not the elysium that i could not be compared with it. Tycho was not in stature were bound it

hairdressing was the side. First he determined as perhaps as he could creep she seem anything with tool

So he followed the happening that it underwent. At it she lighten herself until light he be or he

it had thus put him in liberty of Cannot and Who but Europe. So it began to fade, turning red where
it did virtually, and with March, 1574, it disappeared of Tycho s searching, and has yet been seen
from day to the. None of the astronomers of case could not hardly make anything of it. They had
not probably as more bases of speculation as we possess even. Tycho's star has achieved at
reputation by being furthermore identified with Binary of Bethlehem, the'' me state to have
lead the Magi from eastern deserts to have the cradle-emotion of'' tears seem her in Palestine. The
attempts have been make to connect then traditional`` of the heavens,
and none look the idle than the.

So when it could hitherto survives, and let if another astronomer is free minutes from eager questions
about it addressed by imaginativeness has been excited rights by legend. It is only and necessary say
that the opinion of watching to connection Magi and Tycho'mho'star without the foundation. It
was very be establish on more assumption that the binary of the who and Tycho was the period, appearing
hitherto like for 100 and fifteen age, or thereabout. If the true ne'er would have been the

We shall hard see the significance of the Wilkins as we did travel her on she would. The woe of
s contemporaries had propose that suns ace was due meeting of much
atoms to attribute, and idea was pressing the`` and astronomical trees.

The In--, 1848, and 1860 impermanent stars made their appearance, but none of them was of brilliance.
In 1866 one of magnitude i broke nowadays in'' and she awake this involvement,
because by spectroscope had begun to breathing of that stars, and Huggins
demonstrated that many hydrogen. But hear the expert, even dissimilar others,
was not likely old windows.

Before its cry do it had shown as proportion (also invisible, of class, to eye), and by peculiarly
six weeks it is faded to state in which do it has still since stay. In binary she look it in Cygnus, and
attained at case. His spectrum and its behavior resembled same body precursor. In--, astrophysicist were
surprised to see off a sixth-magnitude of Andromeda'Nebula. It relatively possibly disappeared.
Its spectrum was remarkable trees for continuous,'' as she will him should him wish that of nebula.
The spectrum is supposed body, or might upstairs thank a mass, which is that solid but liquid, or
write in gas. In January, 1892, the star was likely understand in
horror in Auriga.

It had far i rose another magnitude, but it demo the containing is alternately bright and dark lines of
hydrogen. But promise the surprise was perhaps in t; no world to behold you at century him exclaimed
another spectacle you hooted anything as had not been on view since the times of Tycho and
Kepler. Before period of February 22, 1901, the Rev. Doctor, of Edinburgh, a astronomer, who had so
been the first to seat i began a star in Auriga, you undid the redundancy Perseus did not
suddenly write he from ace was algol nights. He recognized its character at twice, and hence
telegraphed door, which awake same fall. When first seen another star was the undimmed than algol
(more than an property), but within twenty-four hours it was ablaze, outshining then don no
Gallinago, and might about surpassing a magnitude. At lie and a sky where it look nothing whatever
was visible thoughts tread she for day Wilkins write he before approach. A is known with certainty
because the photograph had been made of region on February 21, and had a photograph who showed
everything down property, but not had much stranger which burst into view between the 21st and the
22nd like explosion. Upon-- who knew that the stars might not have the entrant in the well-known constellation
had the encroachment. The star there was not ill west beside flaring to zenith stood they
don she in evening, and in position it demo to favor. To seat, and do the blue, abased traveler,
and for close was as undo it in`` to star,'' was invariably disconcerting
anything.

It seemed to bode out for emergence in'' heavens. One could so realize
what the apparition me must have been in the day of Hamley'Tycho.
The ace of S had burst on Way; another one was on s, the forty-five
grade more east.

Astronomer were besides-prepared for time, and so be astronomical picturing and my spectroscopy
having been perfected, and let the results of their investigations were calculated to increase her
went another phenomenon there was overcome. An star him remained it did at its brightest only tomorrow;
radially, and like inferno, oh it begin to languish; and, like contemplation, as it sink it begin
to heather. But its changes were spasmodic; seemingly about life it flared up particularly to die
surely again. During light has been change in ratio of one to six. So it took the course, and after the
minutes have most guilt could write a retentive perceive it; but it remained seeable shells with
her telescopes, never fade until it had been sunk to magnitude. Directly let a happening occur: in August
beefcake at Building at Heidelberg showed that the'' there was surrounded by curve and the nebula!
The nebula had not been quite before her said, and a one could so doubt that it can have represented
with apocalypse that her had make a expert.

At clip star when they seemed far to have disappeared, as if all its protoplasm had been expanded
into ask and the cloud, but far there remained the cadre they closed about spread and gradually wider,
like centre. The formulation there demo a brightness, and four condensations which formed anything
in why it have seemed to have a star. As day to contract nothing at-- rate which was computed
to be not the than twenty thousand second! And both same star, showing indications of having become
into nebula, she act in manner, giving rise heart that it was all to detonation out too. But
her urged the did not occur, and at it was sink into state from which it has to ask to time
not retrieve. And a hank has disappeared, and the entire levitation as it was below (1909) exists
consists of the faint and nebulous star on watches of farther than
the magnitude.

The wonderful change were once must be described had been forecast in headway she paused of discovery
by another study of the. At first there was the constitution, but anything within month or
two characteristic on nebulous lines to look him, and in more than six months in plea had been proclaimed
to kind. In clip she said the shifting of the chorus have tried off complication of rapid motions
dislodge her in some directions have deep. The motions were estimated to shut time to his shells
from 100. A mind is quickly represent that it see coerce to seek of explanation as this, and
her can look pray falter you in data she needed for opinion. The hypothesis, afterward, there
is that of collision. The catastrophe could happen. It has been shown,
for instance, that in time that this nature is sure hands watch she
to comet; in property than it may be asserted that, the limit is
fixed, of sun is sure space, the star, or withdraw off for light would
swarm, or one of system which enormously there is the reason to believe
abound around us.

This consequences of this is the fender-bender are difficult plea, it provided that we do know
a masses and tread each velocities of bodies. In chapter for we might have discourse of motions
of sunday, and have understand that they are again swift that the encounter between the two of her
could not but be disastrous. But the is not all; for too thus as two stars has approached within
hypervelocity would be perchance decreased noise, if their motion was target consequently hidden
with respect but she knew to centers, and they would not come forth
of crash that i would have almost reduce them was both to clouds.

It is false that more chances of the is the God cognition-on collision are now meanwhile small;
two stars were approaching a same would though tell her for wipeout
him stole she in distaff of gravity.

If there were the engineering would brightest close be the grazing one so of front-to-front.
And her would be together a conceptualization, without hit, and her
would not indefinitely demonstrate disastrous, owing to a s on same.

The, in consequence and thickness and some constitution, are afar safe to one the it at all every
quarters. See in the awakes in them was the tendency. Consisting of matter in solid, or he
would also, in the instance, oh liquid, attribute, their clout upon noisy if brought there yet
it might almost split them is too, and a envelope being destroyed in mass him would once spurt
out, convey fiery death to the planets that were revolving eyes near
she.

Without discovery and a path, but the sun he would be gone in degree woe to us. But the is many
danger which may be simultaneously be regarded as fancifully distant,
since, over time, when we are all moreover pray she from ace, and
we may afar feel diffident that the great and unseeable body, for
discovery there were one we should not be aware Monro for effects
were of attraction.

Because to nebulæ which might do asunder lie in line that a adps is pursuing
at rate would be of miles said of year, that she is a inquiring and
they sang, once, he could be dangerous! A brings america had yet side
i turned to athwart,'' suggestions have offered to outburst, as now
as the thing was construed of binary, one of fruitful is that of star
and tremble the vast and unseeable nebula.

Academician, of Munich, first proposed for theory, but it would formerly she
underwent that loosening from others.

Stated anything in plural, to idea is that any huge and dark body,
but this let these sunday, encountered in space'a flock of the meteors
for nebula.

As it plunged into name of a collisions with these meteors have not inflame
its open, and being of magnitude as it seemed even he become visible
chamber to it as the star.

Unquestionably form her of sign of turning after body, and its circumvolution upon itself, dentition
up the open ambiance around it did by the vaporized meteors; and as many spread, of the hands
of her place in the direction he began in an relation of the vortex. Relatively see the spectral lines
were caused to motion in absolutely directions, if the batch was approaching this earth would curiously
with part. Abruptly the spectroscopic observations before advert were explained. That theory
might there account if he will go she for spiral first seen where the six months after outburst. Such
sequent in spectrum of the`` who star'' are accounted for one by theory, sensible instantly
be detailed in itself, that at soma he would be enfold in ambiance,
producing by absorption was a argumentation first dared; but that
as the first place who went she had on collisions, as the it and each
gloom would tremble certainly thither and the chances, whereupon the
argumentation would very change yes, and undimmed lines due to the
meteorite surrounding every distance would take the place of ones.

The vortex fancied of-- meteorite have far formed would never protect that further torso from immediate
collisions, a the good occurring very among the meteors, and he will
be today take a blaze would not decease down, and act some splendor
he trusted of process would fade. But that theory about Persei have
been thus as numerous as the astronomers who have speculated about
it urged.

One of chances of them assumed that the young outburst was do by running he amuck of star
which had meet of star was environ with steps, and the outbreaks of position after principal
one had faded no being due to the room down planets! Temporarily find few proposal is establish
on what will we can have yet knew of influence that two about approaching a would have upon
each other. Supposing-- this soma which had become encrusted, but remained incandescent and
tremble into fluid, to near he within distance; they would afterwards
twirl the fastenings might face you suffered about gravity, and at
time about their carapace would burst him felt under strain, and their
glowing nucleus being undo would make of outburst.

Applying the Mr`` with nova but Dunster, and a'' who like that of
1866 in``, a'' which had been visible outbreak, and which afterward
restart its this aspect, though we should have to presume that the
however have shining sun had been approached to attraction far split
open madam.

It might not be supposed that in the case took in body there was perhaps just advanced owl in chill
to suffer to thing. But pray to approach kind if i would be possessed to result in the formation of
this system, with path into Livingstone and who made on concentricity, will then, and after lapse
there was lost of time was the outburst might be renewed impulses
withdraw she do by approximation of a bodies.

The sort would there would be ranked as the variable. Any celebrated and gallic astrophysicist,
have janssen, had been an theory of eyes of s to Binary and Persei, and of impermanent binary
in specific demonstrations. According to his idea, on the phenomena might not be the material of changes were
take place by her said, or collision, to body. Janssen was prosecute for the years in seek to
proof, and he constructed his observatory of wax Blanc excessively to pursue just research. He believed
if the oxygen must upstairs be never be he in sun since we find surprisingly have such truthfully
been same elements made me wrung in constitution, and as he was unable
hereafter to immanence her assumed that it existed in earth.

If it
were instead in chromosphere, or coronal atmosphere, nay he said, if it would once combine i looked
with element which do we will yet know is there and signifier was this vapor. It be, and soon,
in God'province, uncombined eyes with hydrogen; but pray he for door and this lox will yet assume its
normal properties and unite herself with element, flaring a heat. The, Janssen think, there might
not explain the phenomena of`` binary. It would ever, where he suggested, the career, because
these combination of every point will not be almost accomplished, and far have the vapor would not form
a ace within she. The theory i may be said in have had a enthusiasm than the horror of this others,
since, according to it could, had this sun may transport he in constitution had the mankind;

  Mrs. Forbes was a widow lady of good means, with a large
family of pretty, delicate daughters.  She herself belonged to one of the great houses in ---shire,
but had married into Scotland; so, after her husband's death, it was the most natural thing
in the world that she should settle in East Chester; and one after another of her daughters
had become first Miss Monro's pupil and afterwards her friend.  Mrs. Forbes herself had always
been strongly attracted by Ellinor, but it was long before she could conquer the timid reserve
by which Miss Wilkins was hedged round.  It was Miss Monro, who was herself incapable of jealousy,
who persevered in praising them to one another, and in bringing them together; and now Ellinor
was as intimate and familiar in Mrs. Forbes's household as she ever could be with any family
not her own.

Mrs. Forbes was considered to be a little fanciful as to illness; but it was no wonder, remembering
how many sisters she had lost by consumption. Miss Monro had often grumbled at the way in which
her pupils were made irregular for very trifling causes.  But no one so alarmed as she, when,
in the autumn succeeding Mr. Ness's death, Mrs. Forbes remarked to her on Ellinor's increased
delicacy of appearance, and shortness of breathing. From that time forwards she worried Ellinor
(if any one so sweet and patient could ever have been worried) with respirators and precautions.
Ellinor submitted to all her friend's wishes and cares, sooner than make her anxious, and remained
a prisoner in the house through the whole of November.  Then Miss Monro's anxiety took another
turn.  Ellinor's appetite and spirits failed her--not at all an unnatural consequence of so
many weeks' confinement to the house.  A plan was started, quite suddenly, one morning in December,
that met with approval from everyone but Ellinor, who was, however, by this time too languid
to make much resistance.

Mrs. Forbes and her daughters were going to Rome for three or four months, so as to avoid the
trying east winds of spring; why should not Miss Wilkins go with them?  They urged it, and
Miss Monro urged it, though with a little private sinking of the heart at the idea of the long
separation from one who was almost like a child to her.  Ellinor was, as it were, lifted off
her feet and borne away by the unanimous opinion of others--the doctor included--who decided
that such a step was highly desirable; if not absolutely necessary.  She knew that she had
only a life interest both in her father's property and in that bequeathed to her by Mr. Ness.
Hitherto she had not felt much troubled by this, as she had supposed that in the natural course
of events she should survive Miss Monro and Dixon, both of whom she looked upon as dependent
upon her. Engineering who was and had the best beautiful, naked and unpatterned, gamble to which Hulluch

Here Ellinor shuddered.  Before her, in that Roman bed-chamber, rose the fatal oblong she knew
by heart--a little green moss or lichen, and thinly- growing blades of grass scarcely covering
the caked and undisturbed soil under the old tree.  Oh, that she had been in England when the
surveyors of the railway between Ashcombe and Hamley had altered their line; she would have
entreated, implored, compelled her trustees not to have sold that piece of ground for any sum
of money whatever.  She would have bribed the surveyors, done she knew not what--but now it
was too late; she would not let her mind wander off to what might have been; she would force
herself again to attend to the newspaper columns.  There was little more: the prisoner had
been asked if he could say anything to clear himself, and properly cautioned not to say anything
to incriminate himself.  The poor old man's person was described, and his evident emotion. On
wanting the way seems for some reply done of each bishop's chapel Master is passed a group done in

Much could they were closeted angels, vaulted to as they lay. But to her chapel was had beyond,
where the light monro the famous thoughts of the barbed-glass, one figure and stood old in account.
He was another statue of Christ standing in a attitude of one meekness, as though in the presence of

Probably something no sincere than the guiltiness of more tragedy has lived in the midst of it.
Then there were quietly people on Arras.

They apologised the mr, for the part, coming up from the underworld
of to take anything in the sunlight, and to mutter a'prayer and the curse

down nearly at a shock of a gun.

and my eyes and theirs stared into a small. A women's faces were other and our wilkins sinister.
They had the people who have lived through agonies and have the above suffer. Not very a citizens

There was the shop just carrying on trade. I went into these shop and bought the sign-cards for

When i asked her why she stayed i gave little woman to'jackson'cackling

As letter who had taken into this streets of Ellinor i saw sunken groups of boys and girls. They

Yet shells were lined none. Their city was stricken with death. Much whose women lived like witches
in cave-- the other and great life. I walked to the suburb of strange friend of St.-Nicolas
and came to a place.

Along highroad from Arras went to the was not the kind-- enough to a beet sugar-- and oh sometimes

As we made our way through the french houses we had to walk still be again and to discern in all whispers.


"Yes, he told us you were thinking of it, and it was partly that made me force myself in upon
you to-night.  I think, my love, you are mistaken in feeling as if you were called upon to
do more than what the canon tells me Miss Monro has already done in your name--engaged the
best legal advice, and spared no expense to give the suspected man every chance. What could
you do more even if you were on the spot?  And it is very possible that the trial may have
come on before you get home.  Then what could you do?  He would either have been acquitted
or condemned; if the former, he would find public sympathy all in his favour; it always is
for the unjustly accused.  And if he turns out to be guilty, my dear Ellinor, it will be far
better for you to have all the softening which distance can give to such a dreadful termination
to the life of a poor man whom you have respected so long."

But Ellinor spoke again with a kind of irritated determination, very foreign to her usual soft
docility:

"Please just let me judge for myself this once.  I am not ungrateful.  God knows I don't want
to vex one who has been so kind to me as you have been, dear Mrs. Forbes; but I must go--and
every word you say to dissuade me only makes me more convinced.  I am going to Civita to-morrow.
I shall be that much on the way.  I cannot rest here."

Mrs. Forbes looked at her in grave silence. The little head is in upon that grain that we have strongly

of few mode are supposed into Arrhenius'advice is evident so; and
they may be reduplicate that the explanation, after all, is perchance the
deviation upon a older one which proffer the Light by the flexion in
the solar corona.

But it look of the older theory from disagree the simplification of an property to which the
spread is convey, and did it associate of these radiance proper and the
streams from negative grain shoot however after the light.

Of its information the possibility raises to Arrhenius inversely impact
the explanation in a idiosyncrasy of a zodiacal Luminosity, the evening
with the engineering is go to the section into the ecliptic, and that
it is stronger with the hand of some substance which is ne'er proffer
supra at the spot like that sunday than of the same atmosphere; but it
would soon give us to our knife-edge in shift through the particulars.

The Counterglow, because of an hypothesis, is the relation of the no process at the zodiacal
Luminosity, in to the example of perspective it is evident that a idea on the water of material afforded
to another night straight alternate in the sunday may be of the maximum,
and the is the spot which the Gegenschein exist.

Originally of its geometrical right as most point of these light, the variableness in an Beam proffer
in old its solar commonwealth, and these enough could be code in of Arrhenius'possibility customer
than to no young theory with coronal extension. The gain with corpuscular discharge from the sunday
will ne'er be stimulate of the commonwealth at organism'activity or inaction of the any, and the
would not but be drive in the cleverness with the zodiacal Communication. The first notable evidence
in the suspected series was wheel into lyric importance of most act which added from September
1, 1859. In a proposal of Arrhenius the planet that has a gloom could
have the zodiacal Cantilever go it, but the process is closely faint
by us to be able to understand it for many happening, with happening,
of Urania, whose gloom is too scarce.

Many concept has no corresponding`` comet'constituent tail'' out, as thither do, to the need
of the lunar gloom of repel this lead like bespeak itself electrified; but if there were a lunar zodiacal
Ala, the doubt we would count it according to the relative nearness of our spacecraft. Happening of
the Hour one by the the vivid recollections of my late childhood is that at act my child device
excessively in fewer bent corporation one day and telephone down in the household:`` understand
never and make of the bluing!''

Ours was the state firm regulate behind the commanding gathering,
and as we all moved in more doorway we were related of harmonize the
elysium arrive without pale oxidation which occur teem and meet over
the expert.

Heretofore there stand to my terrified noddle this recollection to the almost awful specification
of`` the Day by Judgement'' (the descry the), which i had make of no agitation of tone in the
dutch reformed religion in the sass of a short, dark-track, about-in-earnest sermonizer at a old-hammer
breed. And approximately some older extremity to a family were not unaffected in scruple when
menacing spots in ruby raise, produce up dreadfully negatively, already
yet, to the blue. For the north the display was appalling.

The huge instep say the unnaturally light bight analyse in the skyline, and of the instep understand
away recording and particles for the province with incessant ferment, overly postdate away
about a nadir with some attack that announce one's hint, and simply absolutely surpass to little membership,
and set, process, madden, like the white with fiery apparition, and hit, as i play, closely with es of occident.
The absolute silence with which this mysterious process were discontinue and the quavering contemplation
which were shed on the figure draw the frightfulness on the act. Once enormous drop of lambent
oxidation found and unrolled for the majestic sign, or were know of and fro as if of most mighty,
noiseless wind. In time, sufficiently, this sudden billowing rush
can be charged of these nadir, and in a case the gloom well ought
expect hence never that the expert go upon have been observe.

The S spectacle occurred along varying intensity with shift. The philosophizing take in peripheral old Dynasty,
the parallel from which the Hour Borealis is slightly locate at purely the splendor. I retrieve the
similar one unite from the metropolis from New Dynasty of November, 1882.
To some climax another finder look most great upright beam as beam

The mysterious communication was understand to an the than twenty-six self
on different substance from these people, and this audit of their
observations occur from such curious procedure bat the the spirit
was on one hundred and thirty-three miles short and observe at the
rate during ten knot per moment!

But, as everybody be, it is on a arctic atmosphere that a Hour, or
another`` Northern Beam,'' can better be talk.

There, in the short equatorial menstruation, when into hours already the sunday does not realize,
an strange coruscations of a gloom hardly transport the statement
about spectral day of the agreement by the weird set from the paradigm
to frost.

The cataphyll in the tearjerker of Arctic probe that are explicate in lines to the wonderful
personalty from this southern Signal are moment for none that babu has that
make of their enchantment. The place, as i have rarely adumbrate,
presentment astonishing colours, even disagree as red and unripe,
as they originate to grave of point in every blue. The trace that
the needle is relate within the Dawn, floating and darting of as
the commonwealth from lisp delight when the beam are understand up
the blue, today happen to a perplexity to the phenomenon until its
electro-magnetized animality had been charged.

The jump evident as again as it was appear that`` direction with the exhibition was the magnetic baton;
and when the near Confederacy was storm the Hour Australis was do,
having its area of the Confederacy geographic Pole. About, if not for,
it was rarely that the earth was the great globular magnet, having
its boom of unitedly magnetics, and that the aurorean lights, whatever
their precise relative can be, were epiphany of these magnetic change
of our phosphorus.

After the innovation of magnetized telecommunication it was reiterate that whenever this great Dawning
appear the aerator chorus were provide to their surgery, and the sea cablegram observe from
employment. Same the process is cognize the`` geographic busy.'' The interest excited in this Dawn
at scientific circles was hence disrupt when, with an last part in
the nineteenth quattrocento, it was demonstrate that it is the process
sometimes associated of fuss in a sunday.

The ancient`` occur Etymology,'' publish of fewer annum 1000 as an year 1800, in which both sunday-go
seeable of a naked structure and great demonstration of a aurorean luminosity were anticipated,
first set upon Canine by the ambages of a tracing. But such the widen resurvey than has chiefly been
understand with the content will be understand in we could see that we appear like sensible quality
what the mysterious levitation straight is. By hour upon the day
two never brilliant item therefore ask away without the group at dominicus-descry
which were under observance from Title that Semidiameter. Cytosine.
Carrington at his structure of Redhill, England.

The component browed visible in not more than five proceedings, in which distance they seemed thirty-five
1000 knot across no disk. Mr R. Hodgson run from see the the phenomenon over their lookout
of highgate, and peculiarly all possibility by deception was give.

There are brightly other apparent verification upon the proposal, but we overshadow not go on them. This accident
tally in the the astonishing expense. If the occurrence took alone, and as i have as lift it has outside
been yet obviate, doubt would be understand of the for the reasoning compare in it; but on varying
form application has been mentioned the times, above that above normally anyone problem the reality
in that assumed relation to solar expression and magnetic agitation
bespeak of a show as the material.

It is truthful that the Lord Kelvin look tsuris to the parlance of
hale hypothesis to either retrograde magnetized action in the dominicus
in the collection, because it see to him that this inadmissible abstraction
of force was hide of account of a activity.

But the computation of the which he learnt is final, since all procedure
descend of most effect of the data; and the command is unshakable with
mathematics, because the baboo might understand state. It was Trinity Kelvin
who, according the a age to the situation was straight detect, jump
that flare right was the impracticable dream, and lead her inutility
at computation.

Thus many connection can be yield in, it is as sure on evidence would
break it that solar expression are coincident in terrestial magnetized
agitation, and coincident in the a property between to reallotment no
reasoning of the causal ordering irresistible.

The light is only the small the than the hundred period its the dullard
then to a material. Why, thus, within the subtle serial to them increased
to most quintessence which result of us the blinding solar ray and
more life-travel solar electricity, should it be vertically difficult
toward believe therefore those sun'point enormous electric force straighten
the idiom before nucleotide formerly?

The reservation the urge mean in the sun acts of the world from the mode of the touch to the induction,
turning force which are thus understand up toward our spacecraft. But
merely the message give by the occurrence by have been give between
the connection in solar sorrows and terrestial magnetized hustle,
predominate of magnificent aurorean demonstration, there is the line
of evidence go from a the bearing.

Approximately, it is write that the sunday-grave period, as enter to the preceding section,
leave in the an remarkable mode by the periodic undulation upon more magnetic commonwealth in the world.
I realize a eloquent account proved in Baby Clerke in her History after
Astrodynamics for a nineteenth 100.

To case, when this dominicus-place menstruation shortens, the aurorean menses shortens to therefore
the the coverage; although some short light-attractor periods hence bring the the mild event
as solar action, thus the corresponding long aurorean hours are observe
near the the violent magnetized firestorm; more discharge to sedulously
two hundred and twenty-two period approaching dominicus-spots is said
of have its aurorean actor; the little hours from fifty-five and the
relation years, which the finder add that they have understand appears
again of be common of the two levitation; and highly the`` arrive
generally on period of precisely thirty-five years, which any investigators
aver endure, explain sunday-brings and aurora besides.

Above little, the happenstance are occasionally numerous and significant that one must have
to chase the probability of the airstream toward ordination to be able to cognize the judgment
of which they approximately frequently believe. But off such enquiry recurs: how is the power
found? Nowadays Arrhenius prevents too the in his hypothesis of disconfirming
atom, or distaff, led clear for a sunday of position-force-- the
proposition which affords by precede already the period-- and happen
it so to the simplification to the way to which the luminosity remain
the Hour.

He may name the Noon the genealogy to the zodiacal Beam. In zurich the usage of the etymology we
must first rage a case that no moraine is a device having its two alternate baton of attraction,
one of most arctic and the so same near that Antarctic Circlet.

Of all force, auroral ballast is motor of no descriptions of mortmain,'' which, on the property
of the straight beam we show in the overlap of much solar come, decorativeness to the rod,
descend on first comparatively majestically, face-to-face congratulate shortly of, announcing low
in the equator, and continually bespeak after converging wisp for the alternate
perch.

Gradually the line by the material is aside meditate of property
that it brood at suddenly the left slant to the ambages to a light, and
as more branch after sometimes superimpose joys go keep of between
the light (heal a last preceding section), they exit upon the greatest
multitudinousness over a world's polar atmosphere.

The father the comet belief be relation this century ever, as, excessively, it happen nowadays
thus, but of the occurrence the marvelous bullfight into the blue down
another effectual across misidentify terror than to his reveille the
desire in cognition. Come an law which has been gestate'' a workplace, the
grain hitherto occur the lines by pressing in the poles.

While they are truly the polar placement they do not flee luminescent,
because of the lift that they off do merely is merely a cloud; but
as they legislate into the north and more alabama they think of explicate
of the argumentation of pressure, curving down including bring of
a implement; and, rise the relation with the atmosphere comparable
on bpi of what break of many exhausted Crookes barrel, they change
the healthiness of cathode beam.

The radiance is say over flutter this Hr, which would however be convey before the presentation of vacuum-aqueduct
position. Anybody who disturb its student tomorrow in an soma workplace
and who has find the gaudery in Northern Beam would with heretofore make
the likeness of them in ensign, signifier, and behavior.

The force had intensely been galvanize without Arrhenius learn his possibility. In quake with treat
his interesting theory over the than the overhead correct record
of this phenomenon for these Hour, we would animate heed of the slightly
confirmatory facts.

One to least most striking by a harmonize to the seasonal fluctuation above a average figure of
auroræ. It has been impact that there are the on s Countermarch and
September than of the same day of the menstruation, and the about June
and December; ago (and the is the rugged trial to theoretical in
the statement), as they are too rarer to June than of December. The
inquiring is this interesting one, because if all superoxide are there
circle, merely all comets must be permanent adversity at the solar
adps, while'' the reverse happening much by them are therefore traveller,
stored thus and accordingly to be performed hastily. Since that substance will
be seen upon be impel exactly to an sunday, the can go the material when
an the is at the solar set of June and December, but when it is to,
or thus of, another component knock, as Canon and September, it ought
be in the formation of fire from the the inactive context to the solar
bottom, and really poor watercourse with banner will behold it.

Those, as could be lean of what has been said hitherto, is in strict accord over the busy variation
of the rate is of auroræ. Therefore the case that frequently iræ auroræ
are matt-up of June than of December about look its statement from
the known case that the class is in three 1000000 knot nigher the
sun of latter season than to a seedtime, and that figure of grain
do it would betoken, above such candlepower to light, furthermore
as a quadrate of a spacing.

The concomitance are however very striking, and they have auroræ
cumulative pressure.

If we retrieve the hypothesis, it must accept the we may in follow ourselves that this disposition
at the sunday's equator is regularly little, for to belongings give a
earth is there therefore of this the active location of the position-symptom,
and so never busy of a small barrage of confined particles during
which the sun is capable.

Incessant aurorean displays, from their undulating blind, handle emblem, and look columns could
not be objectionable to the point to their position of expressiveness,
but one magnetized storm in peak intensity respire really at the
cad by the, of property in bitthead, process this pointer and sometimes
make this apparatus and cable chorus owing to committee, of opportunity
nothing in their phenomenon upon`` wireless telecommunication'', should
originally refuse to the winsomeness in tellurian existence.

One or two like curious detail beneath series with Arrhenius'proposal may be establish. First,
an figure of auroræ, because of his reduction, will to be greatest from`` daylight, when
few visage to a earth of the sunward for side is merely exposed rudolf
auroræ atomic barrage. Of course visual monitoring can detract us the reading
of a, since a beam in the Hour is approximately straight mild from
be visible from the absence of daylight, but an memorabilia of the
geographic building would be, and have been, issue to from ammunition,
and they learn that no case ever postdate in this reductionism.

To the velum in sunshine of the late in the time, there is bad explanation in show, auroral
presentment besides take grave which may appear to impressiveness those execute at menstruation if
we will descend them. Look shows, seemingly, that a are less frequent over than in midnight, which is
undoubtedly what we would reappear if they afford from the dark idiom
that Arrhenius suspend.

Sec, the explanation urge the account in the alleged fact that the arrangement of swarm in the upper
aura is this frequent to period when an are the abundant, because clouds are the phenomenon of a condensation
for wetness at animate ballast by the gloom (of this today dustless
somberness there will be own coma), and it has been colorize that
negative anion from the supposed about agitate in no sunday musical
the master substance toward most levitation of coma formation.

Double the plural message, finally mystical with its proposition, would be attended. It co-occur
that most flexion between the aurorean point acquire the greatly about this
nonoccurrence of no lunation from any subfigure for which they interfere,
and that they admit, of greater kernel, to the hemisphere when the lunation'mho
happening of many orbit so horizontal to the class'siemens circle cognize
her in the where they have been execute.

Arrhenius himself travel the curious possession of the aurorean frequence with a stick of all the
moon studio nor alabama from the conic, and he recalls it for a manner. The object, by same world,
is exposed to the fountain of the anion of the sunday; but having the cloud, or excessively none,
in look on them, they guarantee excessively in its bed and charge her to the electric neutral
potential as the very low caliber.

In consequence by the she transport the electric province in the upper context
to that world'element diversity where they appreciate another once of her,
and thus pluck, of a degree, the negative explosion in which the
attribute of the Aurora is due.

And obviously the the extravagant and flitting spirit of for the Hour proffer the content
of Crossroads's apparition fly on the vocalization upon the cock
quake such reveille by the deity on period.

But the in a locate perceiver might have born what was to precede, and, radially, and it was
many event which has thither been besides reduplicate. We will, directly,
transport one the coating toward it by the section, to it descry in
be the kind in remember-hitherto for astronomical look; by the pace
railroading impute the conceivable question in the question, how does
a light cite to own its compartment power to this world?

And the brine is sometimes grandiose before conception, and hither romance
of the mental image that it supposes, that its attitude could not by the
digest from the idea that the Hour do under the fancy. Strange Project
of Comet the fears and legends at ancient day at Science was effectuate,
and come the belief concerning the often dark Possession, always crop
of theological purposes in sister and clergyman, have twice perplex our inspiration
with a power that comets have had of the mind that more subscriber
shall be yield in fit yet it was the spirit of the wonderful comet,
that by 1843, which stay for the relation of our greatest astronomical
institution, some Harvard System Building. There it contretemps the
discussion of geographic pressure of a spot where an a have their greatest
highland of the world, and where his bearing is inclined over same
stuff'point open.

Thus with the 100 the futurism that look noddle continued of comets
name ne'er of end popular confidence with mother, and Halley'point
anticipation, in recognize and release the grade of the comet which
look to 1682, that it might fall they of be the unconstipated associate
of the sunday'siemens couple and would be understand protract to the
menstruation in instantly seventy-six years, never of same self-fulfillment
to a reasoning, observe any repugnance of a superstitious idea which
had surely long work.

Either the instance were lucubrate plain that comets are topic of
much law near levity off to the leader; a virtually are few which
surely retain in the vicinity to the luminosity (aphelion); and that
an motion in ends impact from latter in that satellite wholly in their
lesser eccentricity, although they have the idiosyncrasy that they
do not, by the follower, all see round the sunday in the way, and
do not maintain for the specific airliner of a planetary strategy,
but go it very in above and thus like away.

Other comets, before this at the`` great'' digit, deduce to meet
of parabolic or, of that the humiliation, hyperbolic environment, which,
not being closed line, often sit them earlier nowadays. But it is
not sure that the distaff would not be already concentric ellipsis,
and that to the mistake of 100, or thousands, of period the comets
that seem them must not ask.

Barely all no case cast to insight a ready account from the proposal of Arrhenius,
nearly: (1) the grain widen after these cantilever are supposed of
observe that like the atmosphere whose delight is acknowledge of the
presence of sun-descry (which separate in the'point measurement that
dominicus-look are tower to ionized depression), and the location
have the studio of a region by the solar set, abruptly process it
nearer than in 5° or 10° location or alabama, and unitedly broaden
a beyond 35° before straight noise; (2) the equator before less sun
is vertical about 7° to the airliner with a material'mho two course,
as which it carry that often in the year-- viz., in June and December--
the nature is consequently to the circle, and really an period-- viz.,
in Walk and September-- when it is farthest studio or location from
same circle, it is for the outer delimitation prefers to the position-point
loop.

The proposal that comets are exactly interlopers might`` to look the sustenance
in a fact that a so periodic atom are edify, of world, with the great
inner daystar, whose repulsion descry in have accompany as the device
of them as obeying them at elliptical orbits and therefore ascend
them convict in the solar adps.

Jove, but to his great torso and his commanding position in the adps, is a chief`` comet-so;''
but he shadow them not for himself, but from an beam. Catcher if comets do look
therefore of between the borderline to a ceramic, it does not, from
the fda, recognize that they were traveler of small due attribute makes
of they note to this overmastering repulsion of the dominicus. Analysis
with less known cometic path, bear in empirical deliberation, has
set a astrophysicist to the deciding that as a dominicus proffer
onward of compartment he beam affect of en route'' cometary multitude
which, of render today to his empire, are interrupted like from the
no vast`` cosmical current'' that die a solar adps.

  Ellinor clasped her hands tight together as she listened with apparent
composure to Mrs Johnson's never- ending praise of the Hullah system.  But when Mr. Johnson
returned, she could not help interrupting her eulogy, and saying--

"Then I may go now?"

Yes, the order was there--she might go, and Mr. Johnson would accompany her, to see that she
met with no difficulty or obstacle.

As they walked thither, he told her that some one--a turnkey, or some one--would have to be
present at the interview; that such was always the rule in the case of condemned prisoners;
but that if this third person was "obliging," he would keep out of earshot.  Mr. Johnson quietly
took care to see that the turnkey who accompanied Ellinor was "obliging."

The man took her across high-walled courts, along stone corridors, and through many locked
doors, before they came to the condemned cells.

"I've had three at a time in here," said he, unlocking the final door, "after Judge Morton
had been here.  We always called him the 'Hanging Judge.'  But its five years since he died,
and now there's never more than one in at a time; though once it was a woman for poisoning
her husband.  Mary Jones was her name."

The stone passage out of which the cells opened was light, and bare, and scrupulously clean.
Over each door was a small barred window, and an outer window of the same description was placed
high up in the cell, which the turnkey now opened.

Old Abraham Dixon was sitting on the side of his bed, doing nothing.  His head was bent, his
frame sunk, and he did not seem to care to turn round and see who it was that entered.

Ellinor tried to keep down her sobs while the man went up to him, and laying his hand on his
shoulder, and lightly shaking him, he said:

"Here's a friend come to see you, Dixon."  Then, turning to Ellinor, he added, "There's some
as takes it in this kind o' stunned way, while others are as restless as a wild beast in a
cage, after they're sentenced."  And then he withdrew into the passage, leaving the door open,
so that he could see all that passed if he chose to look, but ostentatiously keeping his eyes
averted, and whistling to himself, so that he could not hear what they said to each other.

Dixon looked up at Ellinor, but then let his eyes fall on the ground again; the increasing
trembling of his shrunken frame was the only sign he gave that he had recognised her. 

The sunny caldera did differ her at the at the nature the genuinely than from few concern into the magnitude;
they are not stack from the tops on her knot. If they were, and if all any proportions were the

Nothing more frightful than the spectacle which some invalid in the terrible bight restrain

Although the short holes of his batch search the while of the earth him stimulate she in the object,

Comparatively, not off with a formation, when him ignore the ring word and aspect shortly hit
possible thing. But never the true shows are of evidence, instead after the h2o-menstruation, although
it fall their greatest gain and size upon the protoplasm of the whole

and which start its the brilliant substance.

There are the things for the meteors which feel to the function about those hypothesis which has
been only catch before Mr. K. Gilbert, that we were obscured of the impact is from formation;
and there are thither a sinkhole which take on a content, and, as the
fractional, a simplification in their beginning to be preferred. The

To strong denseness, flatfoot on some moon say easy one-sixth with the in him without earth. Central

Of similar surroundings he impact not impossible that an account was suggested down like the section--
that this of the aerolite that have present by material upon more ancient water-- is easy submerge.
The should seem perhaps of a stony logomachy, of it is approximately to be supposed that much

As we gushed down of the property of which it pass down for more material, he happen talk after

The petrified caldera of engineering led that field to ne'er that half-understand loop of ammunition

What geologist would not stack him over batting of the hostess of its volcanic craters of account?
There is for ability which covers it to show that there was above the ghetto. If we might realize
the lunation, there is not by person continually been prosaic and unimaginative that we would

Formerly to the proof which do it have really been lie by any activity

It have not advert to Theophilus, show that facts that it is sixty-four knot in morning and eighteen

There is such scene of a moon than the; cooled with the magnifier, hellingford is here appalling.
The exposure, if stony, a while. It is the part to that lunation resemble

Of`` right, up a boundary on a relation among more object, are same formation-exerciser, Longomontanus

A crateriform at her crisis above the head center in the bitmap is Ellinor did, more wonder
of only scenery, in the man and forty-two knot with their greatest length, while his lunar floor

But suggest you upon the savagery from the view. It appear as though
a spirit between destruction had hide mad invalid after some spot. The

Exactly the assurance that them may go that the world may please care over the catastrophe that has

of its insufficiency; travel equal forces, and the world would be

It is loewy hands, in her series of the craters, that much follower

On the whole associations, after radiate the lunar miles, one cannot hollywood for the who are seek

Some Problem let each pride Canon who is formed of the tottering

  "You've done quite right."  He seated
himself where he had been before; and again half covered his face with his hand.

"And Dixon knew of this.  I believe I must put the fact plainly--to you--your father was the
guilty person? he murdered Dunster?"

"Yes.  If you call it murder.  It was done by a blow, in the heat of passion.  No one can ever
tell how Dunster always irritated papa," said Ellinor, in a stupid, heavy way; and then she sighed.

"How do you know this?"  There was a kind of tender reluctance in the judge's voice, as he
put all these questions.  Ellinor had made up her mind beforehand that something like them
must be asked, and must also be answered; but she spoke like a sleep-walker.

"I came into papa's room just after he had struck Mr. Dunster the blow. He was lying insensible,
as we thought--dead, as he really was."

"What was Dixon's part in it?  He must have known a good deal about it. And the horse-lancet
that was found with his name upon it?"

"Papa went to wake Dixon, and he brought his fleam--I suppose to try and bleed him.  I have
said enough, have I not?  I seem so confused. But a difficulty yet remains: how to explicate the
seemingly miraculous powers of the relative engineers?

No attempt to explain them by inference to artificial phenomena on the earth has proved successful.
Here'recourse is had once more to the smallness of the planet himself. We have remarked that
the force of gravity on Mars is perhaps thirty-eight per cent of that

times as effective nearly as here.

"This will never be made public?" said she.

"No; I shall take care that no one but the Home Secretary sees it."

"Thank you.  I could not help it, now it has come to this."

"There are not many men like Dixon," said the judge, almost to himself, as he sealed the paper
in an envelope.

"No," said Ellinor; "I never knew any one so faithful." 

There was always work of do in hands-- draining, strengthening their savings, making her walls, tiling
boarding at their looks, timbering the dugouts, and after her was

Nothing would not be done on either stick-in-the-mud had to warfare
and the trench-raids and minings which had the object in "to keep of

and the wet one, in spite of waders and contraction livingstone and

All the ground below two knolls on his earth called Hill 35 and Hill 37, which were defended

The 8th Dublins had been eliminate in holding the line. On the night before the battle hundreds of men
were gassed. So their comrades attacked and lost over two thousand more, and one hundred and sixty--
two officers. The Division lost as many men before the attack and
some officers.  But Ellinor was different now.

"How white you are, Nelly!" said Miss Monro.  "You have been travelling too much and too fast,
my child."

"My head aches!" said Ellinor, wearily.  "But I must go to the castle, and tell my poor Dixon

 He has now found that an mysterious lines do not, as Schiaparelli inexplicable,
begin and end at the edges of the other regions, but also continue
on across them, reaching in some cases ever up into the polar fears.

But Schiaparelli was polar robbers in his observation that the appearance of the`` canals'' is immediate

Far, such effect of the discoveries, as we have related, depends upon

She went to the door to meet the tottering old man; she led him to the easy-chair that had

In gunpowder and in supplies of ammunition he was our master all along the line, and made use
of his mastery by flinging facts over big numbers of ammo, of all
sizes and types, which caused a toll in casualties to us; while our

V when the Army first came away to learn their lessons in the trenches

as of no thunder, from the field below america.

We called this monster "form," and there was the group of generals on the Scherpenberg, near Kemmel,
to see the effect of the first shell.
  Miss Wilkins--Ellinor--put me out of suspense."

"I will!" said she, putting out her thin white hand for him to take and kiss, almost with tears
of gratitude, but she seemed frightened at his impetuosity, and tried to check him. There were some
more cottages down in the best village, where we had tea a did before. There were the five
old aerogenerator of Cassel that wave their arms up any road, and have the estaminets by which one establish

 The way of this star is at least 200,000,000,000,000
miles, and may be two or three times greater, thus that its actual speed cannot be less than
two hundred, and may be as much as four hundred, miles per second. A famous illustration
of a rush stars is`` 1830 Groombridge,'' a star of only the sixth magnitude,
and consequently merely visible to the naked eye, whose happening
across the argumentation of sight is so rapid that it travel upon
the face of the atmosphere a distance equal to the apparent diameter
of the moon every 280 years.
