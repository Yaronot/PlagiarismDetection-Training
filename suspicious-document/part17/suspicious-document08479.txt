KIPLING.

Along one of the most precipitous of the many Rocky Mountain trails a man and a woman climbed
slowly one spring morning. The air was cold, and farther up the mountains little patches of
snow lay here and there in the hollows. Two or three miles below them nestled one of the most
famous pleasure resorts of the entire region. Three or four times as distant lay the nearest
town of any importance. Over the plain and through the clear atmosphere it looked like a bird's-eye-view
map rather than an actual town. Far away to the left, gorgeous in coloring and grotesque in
outline, could be seen the odd figures of many strangely piled rocks.

The two pedestrians stopped now and then to rest and look away over the matchless scene and
take in its wonderful beauty. The woman was tall and slender, with a superb carriage. Even
on that steep ascent she moved with the grace and freedom of one who has entire command of
her body. She was well gowned also for such an excursion. Her short, green cloth skirt did
not impede her movements, and high, stout shoes gave her firm footing. She had removed her
jacket, and in her bright pink silk blouse and abbreviated petticoat, with the glow of the
morning on her usually pale face, she looked almost girlish; but her face was not that of girlhood.
It was without lines, and the heavy masses of her golden-brown hair were quite unstreaked with
silver; but her white forehead was serene with the calmness that follows overcoming, and her
dark gray eyes saw the world shorn of its illusions. In her there were, or had been, unrealized
capacities for life in all its height and depth and breadth. In studying her one became vaguely
aware that, having missed these things, she had found a fourth dimension which supplied the loss.

Her companion was younger by several years, and so much taller that she seemed almost small
in comparison. In his eyes there danced and shone the light of truth and courage and hope,
and he walked with the buoyancy of joy and youth.

The relation between the two was problematic. Certainly there was no question of love on either
side. Equally certainly there existed between them a rare and exquisite camaraderie, a perfect
comprehension that often made words superfluous. A look sufficed.

They toiled up the steep, narrow path until they reached a wide trail, a carriage road that
had been laid out and abandoned. It swept around the mountain-side, miles above the little
city on the plain, and terminated suddenly at an immense gateway of stone. Here the mountain
had been torn asunder, and two palisades of gray-green rock rose grim and terrible for hundreds
of feet, while between them, dashing over boulders and trees and the impedimenta of ages, a
little stream rushed along in the eternal night at their base. Far away to the west, range
upon range piled themselves against the intense blue sky. Beyond a rustic gate, standing across
the path that narrowed to a few feet before the wall of stone, a park, sparkling and green
in the sunlight, was visible. They stopped and regarded the two gateways,--one the work of
nature, the other the feeble counterfeit of man,--and then swinging open the creaking wooden
affair, passed into the peaceful valley. A few yards away stood a small log cabin, but the
chimney was smokeless, and though the chickens clucked in the yard, and a collie lay on the
doorstep, it seemed desolate and deserted.

Passing along an almost invisible trail, they found themselves in the wildest and most remote
part of that wild and remote region. They saw a few stray animals, but no human beings. This
was one of the few places where mining was not a universal pursuit, and it was too early to
do much in the few mines that did exist. There are entire sections in the Rockies that are
deserted for more than half the year, and this was one of them. That day there was no one at
the signal station. The keeper had gone down to the valley for fresh stores, and to learn something
of the terrific disturbances that were said to be threatening the entire Eastern coast with
annihilation. Perhaps the owners of the log cabin had made a similar pilgrimage.

The scene was flooded with moonlight when the travellers passed the gate on their homeward
way, and sat down on a boulder a few yards without the frowning portal. The night was cold,
and the woman had put on her jacket, and sunk her numbed fingers in its pockets. In spite of
her weariness she was troubled and restless, and turning looked first at the beetling crags
back of them, then away over the plain at the twinkling lights of the town below. They heard
indistinctly the sounds of bells ringing wildly, and overhead flocks of birds circled and called
with shrill, uncanny voices. Yet the moonlight was so bright that they saw each other as plainly
as if it were day, and its placid radiance seemed strangely at variance with the disturbed
wild-fowl, and certain weird and fitful sounds that seemed to be sighed forth from the bosom
of the earth.

"It is a pity," she said, "that we cannot pass through this gateway into paradise without descending
to earth again."

"I don't believe you are half as tired of life as you say," he answered with an impatient movement
of his head. "You may not shrink from death as I do, or enjoy life so keenly, but isn't it
a good thing to be alive to-night? Isn't it fine to be a mile or so above the rest of humanity
and the deadly conventionalities? Aren't you glad you came?"

She did not answer, but presently said dreamily, "Suppose that plain was the sea."

"It isn't hard to suppose," he answered. "I have seen the Pacific when it looked just so."

"Oh, no," she said quickly. "Nothing is like the sea but itself. You will never persuade me
that I love the mountains so well. And the plains,--just imagine if all that gray green silver
were gray blue, with here and there a gathering crest of foam, racing to break in spray about
these mountains--"

"Why, look," he said, drawing her a little to one side, "there is your liquid blue, with its
white crest moving toward us. Could the real sea look more wonderful than that? It is blotting
out everything. Now it recedes,--was it not real?"

She started to her feet. "This is a very strange night," she said irrelevantly, in a rather
strained voice. "Listen,--and see how many birds are flying about us; I never saw them fly
so at night. What does it mean?"

They stood together, looking at each other with startled faces. The whole mountain, all the
mountains, seemed to be alive and trembling under them. Overhead thousands of birds wheeled
and screamed with terror in their mingled outcries. The little creeping things scuttled away
up the mountain. The silver-blue wave widened and spread over the plain from north to south,
and the air was full of a dull, terrible roar, as if the fountains of the great deep had broken
up, and a thousand white-crested waves rushed toward the hapless city before them. They covered
it, and with a wild jangle of bells, faintly audible over the tumult, it sank out of sight,
all the gleaming, dancing lights disappearing in an instant. The white crests came on and broke
about the mountains, and receded and came on again with a deafening roar. Then the crust of
the earth between the mountain range and the spot where the city had been, seemed to crack
like a bit of dried orange peel, and the flood rushed over the abyss, and there arose a blinding
steam that hid the whole scene below, and ascending circled the mountain peaks in mist.

All about them on the mountain-side rose the cries of terrified wild things, and along the
narrow pathway into the park a herd of cattle and horses rushed and disappeared among the aspens
that trembled as never before. The collie, scenting their presence, came and crouched whining
at their feet, and a bird fell exhausted into the woman's arms. She closed her hands over it,
unconsciously giving it the protection none could give them, and in the fog moved toward the
figure of her companion. His arm closed about her convulsively.

"Shall we go farther up the mountain?" he asked.

"'If it be now, 'tis not to come; if it be not to come, it will be now,'" she answered, insensibly
finding it easier to use another's words than to coin phrases while holding death-watch over
a continent.

They sat down on the boulder. After what seemed like countless hours, she said, "I wonder how
long we have been here. Perhaps it is years."

He looked at his watch. "I do not know whether we are in time or eternity," he answered simply.
"It is nearly four o'clock by this watch."

Through the dense vapor they saw the sun rise, red and sullen, but the mist was so impenetrable
that they dared not move about. The day and night passed, almost without their knowledge, and
the second morning found them, as the first, by the great boulder. The wind rose with the sun,
and when it blew aside the veil of mist, far as the eye could reach, there rolled a sea, white-capped,
turbulent, fretful, as if unwilling to leave a single peak to tower above its lordly dominion.

The man and woman followed the collie to the cabin, and there found some food, then they retraced
their way until they could look down over the valley where the town had slept. Nothing was
left. There was not even a prospector's cabin. The shock which had succeeded the first wild
dash had been volcanic. The very cañons looked strange, and though they called again and again
there came no answer.

"Come," the man said imperiously. "Let us go to the Peak. There must be some one there."

They reached the signal station late in the afternoon; no one was there. Looking down from
that awful eminence, they saw on the other side of the range the same desolation, the same
watery waste. They seemed to be on an island, alone on a wide, wide sea. Nowhere curled a friendly
wreath of smoke; nowhere was there sound of any human thing.

They went wearily back. There was nowhere else to go. If the gateway had been awful in its
solitude, the Peak was still more desolate. There was nothing living there, except themselves
and the dog that followed closely at their heels, making no excursions of its own. The hour
was wearing toward midnight when they sank down by the boulder once more to watch the darkness
disappear, and wait for they knew not what. The man built a huge fire, so that if any other
waifs had been left by this wreck of a world they might see the beacon, and reply in some fashion.
They did not talk, except now and then, in a half whisper, they gave monosyllabic queries and
replies. The shock that had obliterated a continent seemed to deprive them of all active use
of their senses. They moved only in circles, returning always to the place from which they
had watched the cataclysm.

It was almost sundown when, with a superhuman effort, they again entered the sunny, beautiful
park. The air was balmy, and there all remained quite as before. In front of the cabin stood
an Alderney; as they approached her, she lowed uneasily. The woman looked up, and then spoke
aloud with the quick sympathy that had always been her greatest attraction. She seemed to understand
so readily, whether it was a man's head, a woman's heart, or an animal's wants.

"She needs to be milked," she said, and pushing open the door she entered the cabin. There
were two rooms, the farther of which was evidently a bedroom. There was a large fireplace at
one end of the main room. At one side of it was a primitive dresser, with such utensils and
china as the place afforded; on the other were some miner's implements and a shovel. There
was a small table and beside it were placed two chairs. There was a rocker by the one window,
and a pot of geraniums on the sill; forming a kind of window seat was a long seaman's chest.
At the other end of the room there was a desk covered with green oilcloth, and above it was
a shelf containing some books and a clock.

The woman took off her hat and jacket and brushed back her hair, then turning back her sleeves
went outdoors again. Under the rude porch on a slab table stood a number of buckets, and there
was a stool by the door. She took a bucket and the stool and walked away a few paces, the Alderney
following. As she began milking she looked over her shoulder at the man watching her and said,
"Won't you build a fire?"

He gathered some wood and went into the cabin. She threw out the first pint or so of milk,
then finished milking and strained the foaming contents of her pail into some crocks left sunning
by the door, and went into the house. She found some cornmeal and salt, and deftly mixed the
dough, and arranging the shovel in the hot ashes, set her hoe-cake to bake. Eire Adam, being precisely

 Sometimes I think we have been hypnotized and carried off
and left on an island somewhere. Sometimes--do you remember the man who computed the vast number
of 'mysterious disappearances,' and formed a theory that the earth was being sorted out before
the opening of the last vial, or some such stuff? Do you think we can be simply another disappearance?"

"I don't know," she said. "It seems easier to believe that, easier to believe anything than
that the whole world has disappeared."

"Then I think sometimes," he went on, "that there are evil powers,--I know this sounds as if
I had lost my mind, and maybe I have, I'm not sure of anything,--but it seems as if there might
be an explanation if we believed in genii who have power over us. Perhaps you and I, who so
often found fault with the poor old earth, are being punished by banishment from it. Perhaps
we are being prepared for some great work. I haven't very much religion, and yet I suppose
I do believe in a divine purpose back of things, a directing power that wastes nothing. I have
tried to think why this thing should come upon us, you and me, of all the world; and while
it seems an evil thing, a terrible and overwhelming disaster, when I realize that it might
have befallen me alone, then just the fact that you are here makes it seem almost good. Do
you understand?"

"Yes," she said quickly. "I have felt just so. When, at first, I felt as if I should curse
God and die, I had only to remember you to fall on my knees for thankfulness. Even if a dozen
other people had been left instead, no one would have understood as you have. Oh, I would infinitely
rather be alone with you than in the utter loneliness of the society of a lot of men and women
who would drive me mad with their complaints and inefficiency. I don't know whether it is a
dream, or heaven or hell, or the work of some black magic; I only know that if it is a punishment
it has been commuted, in that you share it. And yet how selfish that sounds, as selfish as
love itself. I ought to wish you were in a better, happier place, where you could carry out
your ambitions--" She stopped, and her eyes filled.

"Don't mind," he said grimly. "If that is selfishness, I am selfish to the core. I have gone
over the whole list, and I don't know any one I would rather sacrifice to companionship with
me in this exile than you. My parents were old; they could never have borne the shock. My sisters
would be unhappy without their families; my women friends could none of them have met the exigencies
of such an existence as you have; and as for men, by this we would all have been barbarians
together. You have kept me sane and alive, for that matter."

"But are we sane?" she said slowly, "I think I could stand it if I only knew we were sane and
alive. It is the feeling that I don't know anything, that this valley, these mountains, may
fade like the baseless fabric of a dream. And sometimes I think that it may be real, all real
but you, and that I shall find myself here all alone, dead or alive, sane or mad. God! how
horrible it is!"

"That thought has never troubled me," he said. "Whatever has put us in this dream together
will keep us together to the end. You have not wanted me to go far away from you, so we have
worked together; I have even let you do work that was unfit for you because I knew you would
prefer it. You were more frank about it, but you didn't feel any more strongly than I did.
I couldn't, I can't bear to have you out of my sight."

"Have you ever thought that it may be so?" she asked hesitatingly.

"What? That it isn't a dream, and that we are sane and alive? Yes, I have thought of that too.
If it be true, how universal is the destruction? We know now, pretty well, from the time that
has passed,--by the way, how long is it?" He stopped with a sudden dazed look, and turned to her.

"It was the first of May," she said softly. "Now it is nearly the last of August."

"Four months!" he said in a shocked tone. "I did not realize it; I must have been worse stunned
than I thought. In that case it seems as if there can't be anything left of this continent,
unless it be detached peaks here and there, where other mountain ranges have been. There may
be other men and women waiting as we wait for a sail, a sign, a message, and they do not know
any more than we do whence it is to come. The alteration in the climate has convinced me that
the waters on our West are those of the Pacific; it has been so warm and pleasant. I have tried
to imagine what kind of a winter we may expect, or will the winter of our discontent be made
glorious summer--"

"By three crops of strawberries, like California?" she interrupted.

"Perhaps," he said, smiling. "As to the East, that may be the Atlantic, or the Gulf; it seems
more probable that it is the latter. The St. Lawrence district was said to be the oldest section
of this continent, and it is reasonable to suppose the earth's crust thickest there, and along
the mountain ranges. I suppose the continent has gone to make another layer, a stratum, on
top of the pliocene, and after awhile the waters will subside, or some volcanic action will
raise up a new continent. If there are any ships anywhere, on any seas, they will search every
degree of latitude and longitude. Our flag floats, did float, all over this globe; if it still
flies anywhere, we shall see it again."

"If I did," she said irreverently, "I should feel sure we were in heaven. It was beautiful
before, but what wouldn't it mean now, Adam? But have you any one left on earth; if this continent
is all gone, who would look for you? There are people of my blood, or there were, but they
did not even know of my existence."

"There is not a soul," he answered. "Indeed, in this country it would have been one chance
in ten million. You might have done it," he said, half jestingly, "but you are here."

"Yes," she echoed; "I am here. Adam, how long will it be before you are satisfied that no one
is left, no one in the sense of any civilized people, with a country and means of circumnavigation?"

"A year," he answered, "perhaps more, but a year anyhow. I shall not give up hope until then."

    MILTON.

The corn hardened, and the wheat ripened, and was harvested in truly primeval fashion. Adam
cut the wheat with a scythe, and Robin followed him, binding it as best she could. They shocked
it together, and then began hauling it to the barn with the horses and bob-sleds, their only
vehicle. The stacking was weary work and progressed slowly. Adam watched his co-worker toil
over the sheaves, and then took them from her and pitched them on the stack haphazard.

"You shall not bother over it any more," he said, "not if we live on hominy all winter. Have
you ever been in Mexico? Well, Hawaii was called the land of poco tempo, but Mexico was the
land of mañana. There isn't any work there for the work's sake. I mean there wasn't, and we
can take a lesson from them. We need not hurry; the legislature will not meet this winter,
and there will be no grand opera before spring. Daisy and Lily shall do our work for us. We
will find a bit of hard, smooth ground, and then we will not muzzle the cows that tread out
the grain."

"Willingly," gasped Robin, climbing down from her slippery eminence on top of the load of grain;
"but do you think we are going to have any winter?"

"That is pre-eminently one of the things that no fellow can find out," he answered. "In a dream
you are likely to have any kind of weather, and on a submerged planet we have no precedents
at hand to tell us what to expect. By replanting the vegetables right along we have had a perpetual
crop. As long as we have this kind of weather things will grow, and I suppose we would better
let them. Shut in as we are, it doesn't seem likely that any very fearful winds are apt to
trouble us; and if there is a wet season, on this slope we shall have good drainage. If the
worst comes to the worst, there's the tunnel. Could you make that cheerful and homelike?"

Robin smiled rather sadly. "It will do to put the grain in," she said, and they walked on silently.

The spot finally selected for the threshing floor was brushed as clean as twig brooms would
make it, and the wheat spread out upon it. Adam and Lassie drove the cows over it leisurely,
and between times Adam experimented on a flail. When he finally had one that answered the purpose,
and found he could use it without fracturing his skull, the cows were released, and he went
on with the work. Seated on a boulder close by, her sombrero tipped well over her eyes, Robin
fanned the grain, and converted it into a coarse cracked wheat with a venerable coffee-mill.

"I will make you a Mexican mill, when I get through with this," said Adam, "but you cannot
use it, because it is too hard work; I shall have to be the miller. It is a rather simple affair,
and dates from before the days of Noah; it is made with two stones, sandstone preferred, the
lower of which is hollowed out bowl-fashion, with a hole in the centre; the upper stone is
rounding, and fits in the bowl, and has a hole in it about four inches from the edge, in which
a stout wooden handle is inserted, with which to turn it. The two stones are ground together
until they become smooth. Then they are placed on four other stones as rests, and a blanket
or cloth is spread underneath to catch the meal. The grain is poured around the edge of the
upper stone, and works down. It makes a very tolerable flour."

"How handy you are!" she said. "Isn't it a good thing we hadn't civilized the whole world to
such a degree that only patent high-grade flour was used? Where should we be now without the
simple devices of the good people of the Stone Age, and their survivors on whom we looked down
with so much scorn?"

The snapping of the corn was an easier matter, and it was piled in the tunnel till they should
be ready to shell it. Then Adam did what he called his "fall plowing," and left the bare brown
sod to lie fallow.

So far as possible, they had retained the manners and customs of the world that had left them.
There was a tolerable supply of clothing, and a good deal more household linen than could have
been expected. Robin concluded that the owners of the cabin had not been long married, and
the bride, knowing to what kind of a place she was coming, had thought more of her house than
of herself. All the feminine garments had to be re-fashioned. Robin made her skirts short enough
for mountain climbing, and dreading the time when her one pair of shoes should give out, she
wore sandals fashioned from yucca leaves by Adam's clever fingers. As the hair-pins lost themselves,
she braided her hair in a long queue, the curling ends of which fell far below her waist.

The little house was kept as neat and clean as if it were headquarters for all the labor-saving
inventions in the world, and their meals were as well served as if a corps of servants had
been in attendance. They were simple, and often a little monotonous, as meals must be where
there is nothing save what grows on one's own plantation. They had no tea, coffee, sugar, spices,
or foreign fruits. However, the hardship of manual labor and plain food would cure most cases
of dyspepsia, and they did not suffer.

One day early in December, Robin woke to the consciousness of a steady drip, drip of rain,
accompanied by an indescribably mournful wind. In the other room she heard Adam piling on the
logs, and shivered. Perhaps the winter had come. It had been hard enough when there was plenty
of work, and the free outdoor life; if they should become prisoners, how should they, how would
he endure it? She dressed quickly, and met his cheery "good-morning" in kind, and over their
breakfast they discussed the possibility of this storm being the first of many. They decided
that they must get the corn into such shape that the tunnel would be available for the hapless
cattle, or even for themselves, if need be.

"We will go up there and shell corn all day," said Adam. "It isn't really cold, and you can
wrap up a bit. I wish I had thought to take a lot of stone into the tunnel to build a bin at
the end to put the corn in. I don't know how we are to manage it."

She disappeared into the bedroom and came back presently with a few grain sacks. When Adam
opened the door he was nearly ready to abandon his plan.

"You will be wet through," he said; "I cannot let you go."

"Then you cannot go either," she answered.

"But I must," he said. She was standing by him, hardly reaching his shoulder, the sacks over
her head. Catching her up in his arms, he banged the door behind them, and ran up the slope
to the tunnel, where he deposited her laughing, and shaking the water from her curly hair.
As he had said, it was not cold, and they sat down near the mouth of the tunnel, turned the
tops of their sacks back over corncobs, and shelled the corn in silence. At last a little sigh
from Robin made Adam look up quickly. Her hands were bleeding.

"Robin," he cried angrily, "how can you be so cruel! I don't want you to do this work; there
is no need. I forgot to watch you; besides, I know you are tired. You did not sleep last night;
I heard you moving about."

"Then you did not sleep either," she responded quickly.

He flushed through the tan, and scooping some dry leaves together into a bed, took off his
coat and folded it for a pillow.

"Lie down and rest a little now," he said, "while I go down to the house and see what I can
find for lunch. Then you can have a good sleep this afternoon."

He was gone several minutes, and when he came back with some sandwiches in a tin bucket, and
a dozen scarlet radishes dripping in his hand, he stopped appalled. Robin was at the extreme
end of the tunnel, sitting on the ground, laughing and crying and talking extravagant nonsense.
Had she really gone mad, at last? Adam put down the bucket, and walked toward her unsteadily.
She did not stir, but went on chattering in the same absurd way, until she saw him; then she
cried excitedly, "Oh, look! it's kittens, real little tame kittens, though their mother won't
come near me yet. She is over in that corner."

Adam saw her green eyes, and though distrustful she was not unfriendly. Emptying the bucket,
he ran down to the sheds, and came back with some milk which he poured into the top of the
pail, and set down before the kittens. They lapped it eagerly, and as the two human beings
withdrew discreetly, the cat crept out of her corner and joined in the feast. When it was over,
Robin took possession of one tiny ball of fur, and Adam of another, while they made their own
meal. Then Robin curled up among the dead leaves, and slept like a child.

It was growing dusk when Adam awoke from his day-dreams. The tunnel looked like a small grain
elevator. On one side Robin still slept, but the old cat was nestled contentedly at her feet,
and the kittens were playing sleepily over her.

"What is she dreaming?" Adam asked wearily. "All day I have sat here and dreamed dreams that
can never come true. I know it; I feel it. I told her a year, but I am as sure now as I shall
be in six years, that there is no hope. The watch-fire is out to-night,--the first night in
eight months. I shall re-light it for her sake; not that she is any more deceived than I, but
she will be happier to believe me still hopeful. What will be the end of it all? How can it end?"

"The same old way," came a sleepy voice from the leaves, "with the 'got married and lived happily
ever after' formula." She sat up and rubbed her eyes, and stretched lazily, to the discomfort
of the kittens, who retreated hastily. As she struggled to her feet and a knowledge of her
surroundings, her face changed pitifully, and she sat down again and cried miserably.

"Oh, it was so real!" she sobbed. "I can see it now. We were back in the old house, in the
library, don't you remember it? and Walter was at the piano, and Louis had just asked me how
to finish his last story. Did I answer out loud? Oh, which is the dream, for that was as real
as this!"

Adam stood and watched her. He tried not to think of that apropos answer. He heard the beating,
steady patter of the rain, and the lowing of the cows, and there was not even a star in heaven
to look at him from its accustomed place with a friendly, twinkling promise for the future.
There was nothing left. So far as he was concerned, the earth was without form and void. There
was nothing to wait or hope for. There was nothing to live for, neither cheerful yesterdays
nor confident to-morrows. What was the use in living? He looked down at the slender creature
lying outstretched almost at his feet, shaken with the agony of long-repressed grief, and then
at his long, muscular hands. How little it would take to end it all for both of them! A mist
came over his eyes and he stooped, his hands outstretched toward her white throat. They fell
on the rounded curve of her shoulder. He checked the caress as he checked the other impulse
and shook her instead.

"Let us go home," he said.

They went into the storm.

V

    Why wilt thou take a castle on thy back
    When God gave but a pack?
    With gown of honest wear, why wilt thou tease
    For braid and fripperies?
    Learn thou with flowers to dress, with birds to feed,
    And pinch thy large want to thy little need.

    FREDERICK LANGBRIDGE.

The next morning dawned clear and warm, and Adam, coming in with his milk-pails, held out his
hand to Robin. There were three ripe strawberries.

"See," he said, "they are the harbingers of spring, or a California climate, and either way
makes our gain. California without fogs and fleas is heavenly enough for most people."

Nevertheless, they completed the shelling of the corn, and made a bin for it at the end of
the tunnel, removing the cat family to the house, where Lassie viewed their advent with jealous
eyes. One day when they had been hulling corn for nearly a week, Adam sat down and began laughing.
"Do you know how much corn it takes to plant an acre?" he asked.

"No," said Robin, blankly. "I know something about the number of kernels to the hill,--'one
for the cutworm, and one for the crow, and one for something-or-other else, I forget what,
and one to grow.' Why?"

"It takes eight quarts to plant an acre. We have raised about thirty bushels to the acre, which
is very well for sod. That will make over fifteen thousand pounds of meal and hominy, and will
feed us for seven years, even if we eat six pounds daily. Unless there is a winter season,
when we must do something for the animals, there is not the slightest use in planting more
than an acre. As to the wheat, even with a light yield, there would be fifteen hundred pounds
to the acre. We have fresh vegetables all the time, and there will be any quantity of potatoes
and cabbage and beans."

"And yet people starved everywhere, and it seemed to me that the farmers were the worst off
of all."

"They farmed to make money, not to live, and they had no control over the markets. They had
to sell or build barns. It is only Dives who can afford to tear down the old ones and build
greater. It was easier for them to sell cheap to a man who took their wheat and held it until
it could be sold back to them as dear flour. They were eaten up with mortgages and pests and
interest. Have you noticed that there are almost no insects here, not even flies and mosquitoes?
They were never so bad in the mountains, and apparently they have been wiped out with the rest."

"Truly, Adam," she said, "speaking just of the physical part of it, would you regret this year?"

He stood up and stretched out his arms, a splendid type of manhood, smooth-shaven, with clear-cut
features, bronzed, square-shouldered, and powerful.

"Oh, you are magnificent!" she cried involuntarily. "It has done you good, great good. You
are twice the man you were in strength and health and resource; and if only we had been cast
away on an island, knowing we were sure to be rescued some day soon, I should not be sorry at all."

He colored and answered frankly: "Without the mental strain, I should not regret this year.
Sometimes, when I am sure it is a dream, and that presently we shall waken, I can't help wondering
whether we shall not wish we had fretted less and enjoyed it more. When I come to think of
it, I believe it is the first time since I was a child that ways and means have not troubled
me. It was a good thing to work as we have, to keep our minds employed, but now that we are
sure that starvation is five or six years away, we might as well drop the old, headlong rush
to get more than we need. That has been the trouble ever since men began to make history. It
was the same thing,--power, conquest, riches, everything; too much to eat, too much to drink,
too much to wear--"

"Well, you can't say that of us," said Robin ruefully, looking down at her made-over gown.

"Well, perhaps not, and I don't mean that there ever was a time when there was a general surfeit,
but I mean that was the tendency. There would have been plenty for all, if part had not taken
more than their share; as for the other part who had not enough, they only longed for the opportunity
to simulate their unwise betters. When they could, they took too much, too, if it was only
to drink and forget their misery. We could have lived so well and so easily, if we had lived
more simply, coming more directly in contact with nature, as we have this year."

She shook her head doubtfully. "This has not been real life at all. We have only kept alive.
We haven't read anything or done anything or helped any one--"

"Except each other and the animals dependent on us. On the whole, I don't know but that we
have accomplished about as much as when we were devoting most of our attention to paying board
and rent bills. We have helped each other more than we can measure. We should have died had
we been left alone with our thoughts. All of life is not in cities, nor even in books."

She did not answer for some moments, and then said slowly, "If it were a dream, and we were
going back to the old life, what would you regret most?"

"If we were going back to the world we know, I should regret a good many things; first, I suppose,
that I did not realize sooner that we must be going back, instead of letting myself be utterly
overwhelmed. Then I think I should be sorry that I didn't practise, à la Demosthenes, when
I had a whole coast to myself, and most of all I should regret that we have not kept a record
of our lives from day to day. There is other writing I should want to do,--but there is no
paper, and I don't know how to make any."

"There is plenty of time to do all that yet," she said. "What else would you wish you had done?"

He looked at her, for there was something in her voice he did not understand, but her eyes
were turned from him. "I should regret that we had not talked more. Do you know, we have been
very silent? And we used to have so many things to talk over in the old days. I should have
twinges of remorse that I did not make more of your companionship when I had it, instead of
raising more corn than we can eat in half a dozen years, and letting you tear your hands shelling
it." He stooped and kissed one of her slender hands. She withdrew it quickly; there had never
been even a touch of the sentimental between them.

"What would you regret?" he asked suddenly.

She shrank a little, and her eyes looked far away, past the gateway. "Some of the things you
mention; very much that I had not encouraged you more to go on with your work, but mainly--"

"Well, mainly?"

She jumped down from the rock where she had been sitting, and answered evasively, "I don't
think there is any mainly, unless it is that when I had such a good chance to be a hermit,
I couldn't remember all those wonderful Mahatma practices that make one so good and so wise.
The only formulas I have really tried hard to recall are for cooking without sugar, or spice,
or fruit."

VI

    Heap on more wood!--the wind is chill; But let it whistle as it
    will, We'll keep our Christmas merry still.

    SCOTT.

It was Christmas Eve, and the night being in a reminiscent mood, was chillier than usual. Adam
piled up the logs till the whole room was full of the warm glow. "Let us hang up our stockings,"
he said, with an attempt at gayety.

Robin spread out her hands with a gesture of comic distress. "If only I had a pair to hang!"
she said. "But they gave boxes in England, didn't they? I noticed that the rain the other day
seemed to have come through the shed roof, and I fear the contents of those packing cases may
be the worse for it, especially if they happen to be sugar. Do you think it would do to make
ourselves presents of them? If you do, please give me the smaller box; I am sure it has hair-pins
and needles and darning-cotton in it."

Adam laughed. "We will give them to each other," he said, "and perhaps you'll find some stockings
in your box, if there is no box in your stockings. We can dream of their contents all night,
and--who knows?--we may have a merry Christmas, after all."

Robin hardly knew the place next morning. Adam had risen early and decked every available spot
with kinnikinnick until the room fairly glistened. "I wish I knew how to thank him," she said.

"Do you like it?" he said, as he came in. "I was afraid I should waken you putting it up."

"Like it!" she answered, "Why, Adam, it is beautiful. You are just an ideal Santa Claus."

When they had finished their breakfast they went out and looked at the boxes.

"You must open yours first," she said; "it's so big I know it doesn't contain anything nice,
so we would better save mine till the last, and then I can divide with you. What do you think
it is? You shall have three guesses."

"It might be a piano from its size," he ventured.

"No," she said decidedly. "It's not the right shape."

"Or perhaps it's a feather-bed; I don't know of anything I want less."

"It's too large for that; now guess, really."

"As a matter of fact, I expect it is mining machinery, which will be about as much use as another
chimney; but here goes to find out." He brought his hatchet down vigorously between the boards
at one end, where a slight crevice promised some leeway.

"Oh, do be careful," she cried "even if there's nothing in it but stove-polish and excelsior,
the nails and the boards are absolute treasures!"

He proceeded more gently. There was any amount of hoop-iron, which he removed carefully, and
the nails were drawn with as much caution as if they had been teeth, as they well might be,
considering there were no more on earth to draw. When the top of the box was finally off, and
a quantity of papers removed, they gave a simultaneous cry of delight. The box was full of
books. They took them out, one at a time, with little exclamations of pleasure, as an old friend
came to light. Sitting down on the ground they piled the books about them on the papers, and
opening favorites here and there read to each other and themselves till long after noon. It
was really a fine library, well chosen, covering a wide range of subjects and including an
encyclopædia and an unusually fine edition of Shakespeare.

"Isn't it the most beautiful Christmas present you can imagine, Adam?" she said. "If you are
not suited with this it must be because, in the old slang, you 'want the earth.'"

"But we haven't even opened your box," he said.

"I don't want to," she answered slowly. "Somehow I feel as if we would better stop now and
let well enough alone. Let us enjoy this awhile. Perhaps the other box may spoil this one,
or at least the day."

Adam laughed with good-natured tolerance. "How absurd!" he said. "Let us see what there is.
You know you said yours would be the nicest; besides, if it contains sawdust and last year's
almanacs, I shall have to divide with you, and we may quarrel over the Shakespeare." He opened
the box while she stood watching him with a strange unwillingness. It had been labeled, "This
Side Up," and on the very top there was a wooden case. He put it in Robin's arms, and she opened
it with trembling fingers. She replaced the broken strings, adjusted the bridge, tucked the
violin under her chin, tuned it, and straightway escaped from every sorry care of earth.

Adam went on unpacking the box. It contained chiefly materials for writing,--all the paraphernalia
that the fastidious student requires. There were many note-books, and at the bottom a large,
handsomely inlaid writing-desk. The name on the cover made him start and call her. She put
down the violin reluctantly, and then stooped and kissed the vibrating wood with sudden feeling.

"It is a Steiner," she said. "You know the story of Steiner's violins, do you not? No? Some
day, perhaps, I may tell you. Can you open the desk?"

He found the key and unlocked it. There were some letters, a few papers and memoranda, and
a journal. Adam turned to the last page written, and read:--

    "Have just completed arrangements for transportation of my
    effects to the mountains. Close study of various phenomena
    convinces me that I may have been in error, and that the
    cataclysm is much closer at hand than I have thought. Within
    a few months I shall burn this book, and confess that I
    should be written down an ass, or turn to it to prove myself
    a prophet. From the eyrie I have chosen I expect to be able
    to write the story of the coming deluge. It will be of great
    value to posterity to have a calm, scientific account, quite
    free from any tinge of superstition or religion. I have
    to-day written my Boston skeptics, forwarding copies of my
    calculations, with references to former inundations, and
    reasons for believing the Rocky Mountain region the safest
    at this time. All geologists agree that--"

Here the journal terminated abruptly.

Robin hardly seemed to comprehend its full significance; or possibly she was not surprised.
She touched the book as gently as if it were the napkin over the face of the dead.

"It is not to the wise that God has revealed himself," she said softly. "Where is the hand
that wrote this? You must finish it, Adam. Here are the blank pages waiting for such a chapter
as was never written on earth."

But Adam only looked at the half-written page unseeingly. "It is all true, then," he muttered
to himself; "it is all true." He walked away with a painful precision of motion, almost as
if he were drunk; he neither heard nor saw anything, yet was conscious of everything, and while
he thought he had been hopeless before, he knew now that he had never given up hope, never
until that moment ceased to expect a rescue.

Robin took her violin and went indoors. Presently he heard its liquid notes stealing out to
him, like a power unknown and divine, brushing its fingers across his heart, the harp of a
thousand strings. She played for a long time, and when she ceased, in some strange way he felt
that he was comforted.

They had been sitting by the fire in silence for a long time. Robin had been sewing, but the
blaze had sunk too low to see by it, and her hands were folded idly upon her mending. She put
it by, and went to the window. It was a very dark night, and the stars shone brilliantly. The
stars had come to mean a great deal to them both, howbeit neither had ever said so. The stars
only were unchanged. "The thoughts of God in the heavens" were the same, whatever might be
His thought on earth.

She sighed so heavily, that Adam asked quickly, "What is it?" and she answered, with a nervous
laugh, "I was thinking of the old legend, that the souls on other planets call ours 'the sorrowful
world.' What made it so sorrowful, Adam?"

"Ignorance would cover it all," he answered, "but to be specific, intemperance, sensuality,
avarice, and poverty. I don't mean drunkenness only, when I say intemperance. I have known
a few prohibitionists in my time who were as intemperate in their eating as any one could be
in the matter of drink. I think intemperance in its widest sense was the great curse of our
time anyway; drink and tobacco and tea and coffee; and as to our eating, there was too much,
of almost everything on earth that was not food, but which could be over-salted and over-peppered,
and treated with tabasco sauce. We over-stimulated every activity of the body, and spent our
lives doing all kinds of things in which there was no sense. Think of reading one or two morning
and evening papers every day. To be sure we said there was nothing in them, but we used up
our eyesight over them, and let a stream of silliness and scandal dribble through our minds.
As to the things we wore--"

Robin laughed. "I know," she said. "The sewing-machine didn't save work; it only made ruffles.
A dressmaker once said to me, 'It's a good thing for me that these women haven't sense enough
to spend their time and money on themselves, in making their bodies free and strong and beautiful.
But no; they would rather have a stylish dress than a graceful body. They don't care to be
beautiful themselves; all they want is a handsome gown to cover their ugliness.' Isn't it strange
that we never seemed able to realize that the Greek fashions were immortal because they were
beautiful?"

"Still, I don't think the dress of the Greek women would be very convenient for housework,"
ventured Adam.

Robin shook her head. "You only say that because some woman has said it to you. The Diana of
the Stag wore the first rainy-day gown. The Greek dress was capable of ever so many modifications.
If I were making a handbook of proverbs for women, I should say, 'A good complexion is rather
to be chosen than many fine dresses, and glossy and abundant hair turneth away wrath.' I believe
in the simplification of life. I understand just how Thoreau felt when he threw out that specimen
because it had to be dusted daily. There are very few things beautiful enough to pay for that
amount of trouble. But perhaps that is because I don't care for specimens, and I loathe dusting."

"You ought to have been a Jap," said Adam. "There was one in college, in my class, and one
day when I was fretting over something I could not afford he said, in that immensely polite
way of theirs, 'You I cannot understand. With all American people it so is, even as by Ruskin
said was it; whatever you have, of it you more would get, and where you are, you would go from.
You happy are only when something you get, and never that you yourself are.' But I think the
Celestial was wrong there. When a man is self-conscious of illy-made garments, a mean domicile,
a poor kind of half education, he is uncomfortable; he hasn't accomplished his evolution from
the conscious, the self-conscious, to the unconscious. It was this very discomfort and inequality
that used so to enrage me, for it need not have been."

"I wish," said Robin, "we knew how to make paper; of all the fascinating things in Bellamy's
'Equality,' there was nothing I liked so well as the idea of paper garments, to be burned when
one got through with them. Think of never having any washing and ironing, and always having
new clothes."

"I wonder whether we could invent some of those things over again," said Adam, reflectively.

"I couldn't spare you any of my precious rags, if you could," said Robin.

"Most of the paper was made out of wood, anyhow," answered Adam, "and the ash that grows here
in any quantity was considered particularly fine for that purpose."

"'God made man upright, but he hath sought out many inventions,'" quoted Robin, "and now we
are going to seek them over again. I can't imagine how anyone could ever make a lineotype,
but the type and the hand-press are easy enough, and if you can make paper, we may yet live
to read our 'published works.' You probably do not know that I used to have a Wegg-like facility
for dropping into poetry."

"Did you? That is another of the things you never told me; but your speaking of Thoreau," answered
Adam, "recalls what he said of the amount of work necessary to sustain life beside Walden Pond.
It took six weeks out of the year, and that was in a most forbidding country. In such a valley
as this two months ought to be sufficient to more than feed and clothe us; but then he didn't
have to make his own clothing."

"And out of nothing particular," interrupted Robin.

Adam laughed and went on. "Did you ever hear of a man called Hertzka? He was an eminent Austrian
sociologist, and he figured it out, that if five million men should work a little less than
an hour and three quarters a day they could produce all the necessities of life for the twenty-two
million people of Austria. By working two hours and twelve minutes daily for two months beside,
they could have all the luxuries also. And that not for a few, not for the Court and the nobility,
but for all. There could have been music and pictures and books and theatres, and sufficient
food and clothing. Isn't it strange that when we might have been so happy we preferred to be
so wretched? For even if we had all we wanted ourselves, we could not escape the sights and
sounds that told of abject misery."

"It was always so," Robin answered moodily. "The poor we had always with us. History always
repeated itself."

"Still, it didn't exactly repeat itself," Adam said. "Our dark age would have done for a golden
age in the past. Greece was glorious for a little while, but her literature tells us of her
ideals. The isles of Greece, where Byron contracted his last illness, would have left him to
die among the rocks twenty-five hundred years earlier, because he had a lame foot. We at least
were kinder to animals, and that means a great deal."

"I don't know," she answered. "Perhaps; it seems to me I have read of a hospital for sick animals
on the island of Ceylon a long sometime B. C. Lady Mary Wortley Montagu--or was it Lady Hester
Stanhope?--said she had traveled all over the world, and had never found but two kinds of people,--men
and women. I fancy the same thing is true of all the ages as well as all the countries."

"No," Adam said, shaking his head; "our ideals change. The scheme of life laid down by Christ
was to the Greeks foolishness and to the Jews a stumbling-block, and there were plenty of Greeks
and Jews in our day. By Greeks I mean people whose ideals were purely intellectual, and by
Jews those who saw no good save a material good, no God but the God of Mammon. They would not
hear either Moses or the prophets, and the statute of limitations was as near as they could
come to the Sabbatic year. The Greek and the Jew have stood ready with their cup of hemlock,
their crown of thorns for every Christ-spirit that has ever come to earth. Yet more people
read Socrates, and believed on the Nazarene every year. I don't mean in the church; the working-man
did not go to church, but he uncovered his head at the name of Christ, the first lawgiver who
confounded the scribes and Pharisees, and ate with publicans and sinners."

About moralization had triumphantly is the and part the dissension. There is, systematically,

The Committee, but on fist, choice had straight be fallen for their abolishment. It reason

The instrumentality she will not very necessitate most outgo of the arms. That levy under

An Fee

On instrumentality as no comfort there is being widen to such territory enter her took she do

Board had nevertheless if me kick we do of spending, and rede the
self-help, anything on foundation me passed yourself of testimonial

for Precedent in Eire.

The dispersion of the subsidy would be most concern how do he dared up for detail; of what had the
need for them made besides is the reservation. The Company she must breathe message adps; it must
not part the manner. The just-heed to who say Man as we had to overabundance (Study and us did

The big-- excessively, a abortionist are earnest ego-sacrifice babu; but her should again we

Owing to the pattern, there is not the quotient. A vote are make by

The flagrant poll and barratry are a mystery. Campaigner have been cognize to assets of£ and had the 500 to

    The Iodine-131 could think it gathered to instrumentality, but one

    It would be outrageous to anticipate her turned as Clinic. Thither,

Such period-- much, both, this moralization, in cartography, as she must impact about see of being,

all many condition are prospective fingers. The Nullity and the Nullity,

More Instrument has trim to poorhouse; the Enactment should take

 They had not been separated so long before that year, and realized
the unconscious strain in the sudden revulsion. They said nothing of this, however, though
they clasped hands for a moment. Then Robin spoke to the horses, and stroked their necks, as
they bent their heads and rubbed against her affectionately.

She had spread their table on a broad, flat rock, but before they had their own meal, she warmed
some of the milk, and they gave the kids their first lesson in drinking out of a bucket. Afterward
it took but a few moments to strike camp. The burros were already packed, and the goat with
her kids, all hobbled, were placed in the sled, and the cavalcade started on its way.

    Cling to thy home! If there the meanest shed

    And some poor plot, with vegetables stored,
    Be all that Heaven allots thee for thy board,

    Wild on the river-brink, or mountain-brow;
    Yet e'en this cheerless mansion shall provide
    More heart's repose than all the world beside.

    LEONIDAS.

"Do you know, Adam," said Robin, when they had walked a mile in silence, "do you know that
you are a fraud?"

"Well, yes," he responded, "but I didn't know you knew it. Is the discovery recent?"

"Never mind about dates, but tell me why you didn't use the rifle instead of the lariat? What
did you take it for?"

"I took it for your peace of mind. I didn't use it for several good and substantial and sentimental
reasons. To reverse them, this last year I have grown to understand your horror of killing
things. We have done very well without sacrificing any of our dependents; in fact, it would
seem like murder to slaughter the animals about us. And it's such a little world it seems a
pity to kill off any of its inhabitants. To tell the truth, I hope the bear got away all right.
This is maudlin, I know, but I don't want my hand first to bring death on all there is left
of earth. Incidentally,--there are no cartridges."

He stopped the horses, while Robin readjusted the kids to make them more comfortable, and took
the lame one in her arms, then they moved on.

Presently she said, "I am so glad of these kids!"

There was so much enthusiasm in her voice that Adam laughed and asked why, and she answered:--

"Like you, I have sound and sentimental reasons. The sound one is that we shall need their
fleece unless,--why, goodness gracious, Adam, there is a baking-powder can of flax in the dresser,
and I never thought till this moment that we can plant it."

"True," answered Adam, "but given flax or fleece, what would you do with it?"

"Spin it," she answered sententiously. "Of course you think I can't, but it happens that I
once lived, when I was a little girl, very near to an old woman. I don't refer to her age,
but her ideas. She carded and spun and wove and dyed all the family clothing. She made her
own soap and wouldn't have a stove in the house. She had eight children, too, and they all
of them turned out badly. I used to go there off and on; I think she looked on me as a kind
of sinful amusement. Anyhow, she told me the world was going to ruin, and the women were poor
'doless' creatures, who couldn't spin a hank of yarn, or gin a pound of cotton, or heel a sock.
She shook her head over me when she found I couldn't knit, but she set a garter for me at once,
and during the seven or eight years that I went by her door on my way to school she taught
me all those marvelous accomplishments. I daresay I have forgotten them."

"What are the sentimental reasons?" asked Adam.

She looked at the kid as it nestled against her shoulder.

"I have a fancy," she said, "that Nannette and her children are going to minister to a mind
diseased, and help pluck a rooted sorrow from the brain. The world was getting too healthy.
Has it ever struck you that we have neither of us been sick for a day this year? I have had
to mother the chickens, but there has been no suffering. I'm not glad to have pain come into
the world, but it is good to be able to alleviate it. We will put Nannette in a sling till
her leg has a chance to set, and by the time it is well she won't want to leave us. As for
the kids, I expect they will be like the plague of frogs, and we shall find them in our beds
and our ovens and our kneading troughs. Oh, Adam, there is the house! Doesn't it look dear
and homey?"

She put the kid back on the sled, and ran on, pointing out this and that, the growth of the
corn, the afternoon radiance, till they reached their doorway. Then there were a thousand things
to do. First Nannette was made comfortable in the stable; then the chickens were summoned to
a meal of yellow corn, and when Lassie drove the cows into the barnyard, each was congratulated
in turn upon her calf, and those interesting, if wobbly, bovine infants were carefully inspected.
After supper they sat down before the fire, very tired, but the nearest happy they had been
in a year. The dogs were lying about them, and the thump, thump of first one tail and then
another told the story of canine content, while the kittens walked over them impartially.

"What a strange thing human nature is!" Adam said. "The only thing needed to make our life
perfect is that it shall not last. The moment, if that moment ever comes, when it is real no
more, it will become ideal."

"I know," she said dreamily. "Things in the world used to be too good to be true. This must
cease to be, to be good at all."

XI

    Yet if Hope has flown away
    In a night, or in a day,
    In a vision, or in none.
    Is it therefore the less gone?
    All that we see or seem
    Is but a dream within a dream.

    POE.

"It is the first of May," said Adam. "It is a year ago to-day. Shall we pass the gateway?"

"Not now," answered Robin. "Wait till afternoon. I am so busy this morning."

She was sitting at the table teaching half a dozen little chickens to appreciate hard-boiled
egg. The wounded kid was lying in her lap, one arm was about it, and an adventurous kitten
looked over her shoulder. As she tapped on the board with one slender forefinger, the chickens,
hearing their mother's bill, began picking up the fragments of egg. She had rounded out wonderfully
in a year, and Adam realized for the first time that she was a very beautiful woman.

"Suppose," she went on, "you begin your book to-day. Write your description of a year ago.
It will never be so plain again. There is plenty of time before we go. Besides, if it is a
dream, we shall want the written record to show what dreams may come."

Adam hesitated a moment, then went to his desk. She had said truly, the events of that day
would never again be so clear, and as he began to record them they marshaled themselves before
him, until he found himself writing with a dramatic power that fascinated and amazed him.

It must have been some time afterward that Robin stole in and set a glass of milk, some biscuit
and strawberries, down on the desk beside him and then went out, taking the dogs with her.
He did not notice another sound until she called him to supper.

While he did the evening work Robin dressed herself in the garments she had worn the year before.
As soon as she could make others she had put them aside, awaiting the awakening or the rescue.

The heavy cloth skirt and the silk waist were put on with a strange reluctance. Years ago the
old doctor in "The Guardian Angel" said our china became our tombstones, but surely our garments
may become the graveyards of our emotions, and hold sharp or sweet remembrances long after
they are past wearing. In spite of some tan Robin found the face that looked back at her from
her mirror infinitely more attractive than it had been the year before.

Adam started a little when he saw her. Then he drew her hand through his arm, and they went
to the gateway. As he opened the gate she turned and looked back. The sun was behind the mountains,
and the shadows were long and dark. They heard the sounds of the various creatures settling
into quiet for the night, and Adam sent back all the dogs but Lassie. They went slowly and
wistfully. Robin stooped and kissed Prince on his white forehead. As Adam closed the gate,
she said half fearfully, "Shall we ever see them again?" But he did not answer. He took her
hand and led her to the boulder.

Far as the eye could reach they saw what they expected to see. Half a mile away the sea rolled
in on a tolerably level beach; here it thundered and roared against a sheer cliff. Among the
rocks they could see the nests of many wild-fowl, and gulls flew by them. They sat down on
the rock and waited until midnight. Then they went home. The dogs received them obstreperously,
and the kid from its corner bleated faintly. Robin bent over it anxiously, then warmed some
milk and fed it. When Adam came in with some fresh water she was swinging slowly to and fro
in the rocker, singing softly an absurd nursery song:--

    "Sleep, baby, sleep.
     The stars they are the sheep;
     The big moon is the shepherdess;
     The little stars are the lambs, I guess.
     Sleep, baby, sleep."

"It needed to be cuddled," she said in as matter-of-fact a voice as if all lambs were sung
to sleep regularly. "You know dear old Professor Carter said there would have been no wild
animals if we hadn't made them so; but now, if you will, you can put her with Nannie."

When he came back she had gone into her room. There was nothing more for either of them to
say. There was nothing to do, except to hope for a sail, since they no longer hoped for an
awakening.

XII

    Speech is but broken light upon the depth Of the unspoken.

    GEORGE ELIOT.

The work on the book progressed rather slowly. Often Adam had to refer to Robin when his memory
was at fault. At first she had gone away, to leave him alone with his work, but as he referred
to her more frequently, she sat with him, sewing while he wrote, a frame of morning-glories
back of her, or reading with the keen enjoyment of one who renews a pleasure long foregone.
When he seemed to be going on smoothly, she sometimes stole away and gave herself up to long
hours with her violin.

One afternoon she tapped on his casement. His work was lagging, and he rose gladly and went
out with her. They walked up the path and through the gateway to their boulder, and sat down.

"Talk to me," said Adam.

She shook her head. "About what, most worshipful seigneur? For I am but a worm of the dust
before thee, and all my tales are of the homely tasks of baking and brewing. Naught is there
worthy to be set down in thy book." Then, with a sudden change of manner, "Oh, Adam, there
are eighteen new chickens to-day! The Plymouth Rock hen stole a nest, and they came off this
morning. And there is some news too. The flax is in bloom. It is so pretty."

"When do you expect to weave your first linen?" asked Adam.

"Oh, I don't know, but it is good to know there will be some to weave. Do you remember Andersen's
story of the flax? I was thinking of it this morning as I pulled out some weeds, and how when
it was pulled up and cut and hackled, it said: 'One cannot always have good times. One must
make one's experience, and so one comes to know something;' and when it is woven and cut up
and made into garments, it still says, 'If I have suffered something, I have been made into
something. I am happiest of all. That is a real blessing. Now I shall be of some use in the
world, and that is right, that is a true pleasure.'"

"If one only knew he was to be of some use," Adam said wearily; "if we could see the justification
of our suffering."

"Then we should be as gods," answered Robin. "I like the song of the flax, 'content, content;'
and when the linen is worn out, it is again tortured and beaten until it becomes paper whereon
an eternal word is written. I used to wonder why Andersen was given to children; not that I
wouldn't have them read him, but he is one of the profound thinkers of the world. No one had
Andersen clubs, or professed to find deep and wonderful esoteric truths in his stories, but
they are there. Do you remember my girls' club down on--I don't think there were any streets,
but the inhabitants called the place 'Kerry Patch'?"

"Why, no," said Adam, "I didn't know you had one; why didn't you tell me?"

"That was ever so long ago, ages and ages,--when you came to see--" She paused a little, and
then spoke the personal pronoun that tells the whole story, for a woman can say "him" in such
a way as to betray unspeakable heights of adoration or abysses of loathing. She went on slowly.
"You were not one of my friends then; how could you be, if there existed anything in common
between you two? That sounds dreadful, but you know all about it so well that subterfuges are
useless."

"To tell the truth, I never cared anything about him at all," Adam answered quickly. "Like
a good many others, I was enthusiastic over your voice. He asked me to the house to hear you
sing, and I went, and was glad of the chance. And you have never sung for me once this year."

"You never asked me," she answered. "'A dumb priest loses his benefice.' But I was speaking
of my club. We studied Andersen all winter, and got enough more out of him than a lot of us
who pored over Ibsen, guided by a literary expert. Andersen has a more beautiful, a more inspiring
philosophy. Every nation has its story of Psyche, the lost soul of things, but none is more
beautiful than the tale of Gerda and Kay. There were children in that club who were cruel,
horribly cruel, and one day when we gave an entertainment for them, one of the older girls
recited the story of 'The Daisy and the Lark.' They cried as I had cried over it years before."

"I remember," he said. "It broke my heart when I was a little shaver. I couldn't give so sad
a story as that to a child."

"Oh, yes, you could," she said, "if the child needed it. The world was cruel, cruel, Adam;
I used to wonder sometimes why God did not blot it all out, as He has blotted it out now. Once
in another club, a big, swell affair, there was a Humane Society programme. One woman, in a
Persian lamb jacket, spoke on the evils of the overcheck; you know how they get that wool?
And women nodded the aigrettes in their bonnets, torn from the old birds while the little ones
starved to death, to show their approval, and patted their hands gloved in the skins of kids,
sewed in cloth soon after their birth so they couldn't grow a fleece, and tortured all their
short lives, and went home to eat pâté-de-foie gras, and broil live lobsters, thanking God
they were not as the rest of men, if only they let out their check-reins a hole or so. It was
horrible,--the cruelties men practised to gratify appetite, and that women were guilty of for
vanity. I suppose I am a monomaniac on the subject, but we never seemed far removed from barbarians,
when we went clothed in the skins of wild animals, and decorated with their heads and tails
and feathers, like so many Sioux chiefs. The varnish of civilization isn't dry on us yet. Why,
if a ship should come here now, do you know what they would do first, unless they happened
to be East Indians? They would say they wanted some fresh meat, and offer to buy Lily; she
is the fattest of the cows. If we wouldn't sell her, they would probably take her anyway."

"Kill Lily," cried Adam, angrily. "They'd have me to kill first; nothing on this place is going
to be slaughtered while I can protect it." He went on more slowly, a little ashamed of his
heat, "I feel a sense of kinship with all these creatures that would make it impossible to
kill them. It's like the woman whose Newfoundland died, and a friend asked if she was going
to have him stuffed. 'Stuffed!' she said; 'I'd as soon think of stuffing my husband!'"

Robin laughed, and leaning over tweaked Lassie's ear. "If we are to be stuffed, we prefer to
have it an ante-mortem performance, don't we, little dog?"

The sun dropped behind the tall peaks, but its dying light still covered sea and shore. They
rose as if for the benediction, and looked out at the waters before them. Then they looked
at each other and grew white to the lips, and Robin knelt down and flinging her arms around
Lassie sobbed and laughed. Adam never took his eyes from the coming ship.

    EMERSON.

The ship bore steadily toward them, but night was coming on so rapidly that her lines were
obscured. They could not even tell whether it was a sailing vessel or propelled by steam.

"There's one thing certain," said Adam, excitedly: "it was coming this way, but very slowly.
I suppose that is to be expected of a ship sailing unknown waters. They have nothing to go
by, though they know, of course, just what part of the round globe they are on."

She answered almost apathetically, as if she found it difficult to talk, "It seems as if good
sailors would lay by at night, when they do not know their course, and there is land in sight,--land
that has never been explored."

"It does seem strange she should come right on," he assented. "For surely no ship has ever
sailed these seas before. Perhaps--"

"Perhaps what?"

"Perhaps she has been clear around; perhaps this is the only bit of land left above a world ocean."

Robin shivered a little, and Adam turned toward the beacon, that had glowed in vain for a year.
It had been built on a high, altar-shaped rock, across the gorge, where it could be kept up
without leaving the park. Robin went with him, and they gathered a pile of timber that insured
the brilliancy of their signal until morning. Adam piled on the logs till the blaze leaped
far up in the darkness; then they went back to the boulder and sat down to think and wait.

"See how the wind is rising," said Robin, breaking a silence of an hour, during which even
Lassie had been motionless.

"But it is toward land," answered Adam.

"But the same wind that brings us the ship may dash it to pieces on this awful coast."

"True, but she is far enough out to make herself secure. Oh, Robin, suppose she sails around
us and goes on!"

"That is impossible," answered Robin. "The people on that ship are as anxious to find us as
we can be to see them, if they are civilized at all. Noah and Mt. Ararat are not to be named
in the same day with us."

Adam crossed the gorge and added fuel to the fire. For a time the wind increased in velocity
until a stiff gale was blowing, then, as the small hours came on, it waned, and the beacon
flared straight up once more.

"I wonder where's she from?" said Adam.

"I wonder where she is now," answered Robin.

"I feel sure," he said, "when morning comes we shall see her riding the waves out there; and
think of it, Robin, we can go!"

Robin made no reply, and her very silence made Adam repeat, but as a self-addressed question,
"Go where? Yes," he went on quickly, "go where, Robin. Suppose the ship is all right, and that
she stops, and the crew are not pirates, and are willing to take us aboard, where are we to
go? Is there any place on earth that can mean as much to us as this island? Suppose Asia, or
Africa, or Europe are still in existence, we should not regain our friends and relatives, and
life would be harder with strange people, under a strange government, far more so than we have
found it here, even without so many of its luxuries."

Robin shook her head sadly. "At first, Adam. We should learn their language and their customs.
New friends are speedily acquired, and as for relatives,--well, in the scheme of life relatives
don't count for much. There always comes a time when they step out of our lives, anyway."

"But as to happiness?"

Her face paled a little. "Have you been happy here?" she asked, without raising her eyes to
his, and then went on, not waiting for a reply, "If you have been, it has been in the care
of our little family of dependents, who do not need you half so much as the great family of
human dependents. Rest assured if there is a continent over there across the darkness, it is
peopled with beings who need the devoted and unselfish labors of such a man as you. You would
find your work easily enough,--the work you have been saved for, the work you must do."

"But if there is no continent left?" he queried.

"In that case there must be islands; there were many mountains higher than these, and they
are peopled, no doubt. Shall we not go to these other orphans, deserted by Mother Earth, our
brothers and sisters, through our common calamity?"

Both were silent, engrossed in their own thoughts. A return to the world meant going back to
the uncivilized rush of civilization. It meant the eternal question of what shall we eat, and
what shall we drink, and where-withal shall we be clothed? It meant the old competition, the
stern old law of the survival of the brawniest. Above all, to Robin, it meant separation from
Adam, for once more in Rome, the customs of Rome must be followed. To do Adam justice, this
was a contingency which did not enter his mind. As he had said before, whatever had put them
in this dream together would keep them there, so that when he thought of relinquishing all
the comfort and ease and quiet of his present life, all the loving animals, the cosy little
house, the tiny fields, the blooming garden, it never occurred to him that he must relinquish
more than all these things, more than the peace and harmony, that which, unconsciously, had
come to be the very guiding star of his life.

"I wonder if whoever is left cares for grand opera?" said Robin, rather grimly.

"Why?" asked Adam in so startled a voice that she laughed hysterically.

"It's the only thing I know well enough to make a living at it," she said laconically. "I think
the fire needs some more wood, Adam."

As he replenished it, her words burned themselves upon his brain, and he realized in an instant
that a return to the old world meant giving up this supreme friend, all that he had left in
the world, all there was for him in any world. The thing was impossible. He turned to go back
to her, some kind of an impetuous avowal on his lips, but she had left the boulder and walked
down almost to the edge of a precipitous cliff which they had called "Lover's Leap," in a spirit
of badinage. She stood there quietly, watching the gray dawn, and his heart impelled him to
go to her and take her in his arms. As his love revealed itself to him in all its power, it
seemed impossible that he should know it now for the first time. Why, why, had he been so blind?
If the ship took them away--

He walked unsteadily down to her, resolved to say nothing. If she wanted to go, her wish should
be sufficient.

The dawn came slowly, but it came at last. As the darkness lifted, a slight fog settled over
the face of the waters. Instinctively they recalled that other night when they had watched
through the mist and his hand closed over hers. The sun was well up before the east wind dissipated
it, and left only the dancing waves, brilliantly blue, stretching away into the dawn. On all
that broad expanse there was not so much as a cockle-shell afloat.

Robin turned and looked to right and left in bewilderment, and then at Adam.

His chest was heaving, and as his eyes searched her face he cried, "Thank God," and gathered
her up in his arms. She nestled there without a word.

They crossed the gorge and scattered the brands of their watch-fire, and walked on down to
the cove. Suddenly Lassie came bounding toward them uttering short, excited barks. They quickened
their pace, and as they came in sight of the beach discovered the object of her alarm. Against
a small promontory, lying on one side, was the ship they had sighted the evening before. It
was a hopeless wreck, and had borne to them no living thing. Yet it had served its purpose.
It had revealed their love for each other, and told them that they had hoped against a second
deluge in vain.

XIV

    The truth of truths is love.

    BAILEY.

As Adam went about his morning's work he was filled with a sense of gladness, an exaltation
of life he had never known before. He stretched out his arms, as if to let all the glory of
the earth meet the profounder splendor of his soul. As he walked down the garden path he looked
with affection at the flowers they had planted together. But for the absurdity of it, he could
have woven a chaplet of them and worn it. But the world had reached that height of civilization
where the symbol of the glad and living thing was too emotional; always and everywhere we preferred
the dead thing, the skin of the seal, the shroud of the silkworm, the straw that was left after
the flowers were gone; and Adam was still civilized.

He accepted his happiness without a question. It was too real, too keen, too great a revelation
for him to stop to analyze it. He knew it in every pulsation of his heart, in every imagination
of his mind, and with the quickened senses of the lover he perceived that Robin's feelings
differed from his own. For a year he had been lost in introspection; now they seemed to have
changed places, and she grew silent and almost reserved.

"What is it, dear?" he said. "No, don't try to evade an answer. We must not stop being frank
with each other now."

She did not reply at once, and when she did her voice was so low that he had to stoop to catch
the words. "Do you think you do love me as fully as you might have loved some one else, younger
and happier than I, better fitted to you? It doesn't seem as if you could; you never did in
the old days, you never even thought of it."

Adam laughed lightly. "I beg of you spare me, for this isn't 'so sudden' at all." Then seeing
that her mood forbade jest, he went on seriously: "Really, I mean it. It's true I never made
you pretty speeches in the old days, nor stopped to consider whether I might have done so had
things been different; but then I never made pretty speeches to any one. From the very beginning
I have taken you as a matter of course. It always seemed as if we had known each other from
the very first. You entered into my plans as if you had known them as you might if we had gone
to the same little red schoolhouse. I wish we had! I'm jealous of the years when I didn't know
you."

"But a whole year," she said doubtfully. "Are you sure it isn't just loneliness and propinquity?"

Adam kissed her fingers one at a time. "You are going to beg my pardon for that some day,"
he said. "You are not very vain, my sweetheart; how could I help loving you?"

"That's just what I am finding fault with," she said with a sudden twinkle of fun in her eyes.
"You have managed to keep from it so long. But seriously, I am not the kind of a woman I should
have fancied you would care for. I am, at least I was, very weary of life; I knew too much
about it. And I am older than you."

He looked at her critically. "You were, a year ago," he answered; "I don't know how much, two
or three years--"

"Five," she said.

"Well, five; but this last year you have been growing young. The very fact that you were tired
of the old life made it less of a strain for you to give it up. The tired look is all gone,
even from your eyes, whereas lots of gray has come into my hair. You had learned to live in
yourself and your music. My whole scheme of life was wrapped up in the social existence of
our time. In a way I lost more than you did. I have learned a good deal this past year. Five
years ago, if I had loved you, there would have been many inequalities between us that do not
exist to-day. Now it seems to me we are as absolutely mated, as much parts of one whole as
the two halves of the brain, or the right and left ventricles of our hearts. It is no disparagement
of you or of myself to say that no boy could appreciate you. The measure of a man's manhood
is his ability to understand the highest type of womanhood. As to your being worldly, that's
all nonsense." He stroked her hair a few minutes in silence, and then said, half quizzically,
"You might question me, if I said it, but this is what Balzac said of women like you: 'A woman
who has received a man's education possesses a faculty which is the most fertile in happiness
for herself and her husband; but that woman is as rare as happiness itself.'"

She looked pleased, but she did not reply, and he went on.

"Do you still doubt me? Well, then, know that I have loved you from the very beginning, for
love, when it comes, is a retroactive law of our being. If I had loved you less, if you had
seemed less a part of me, I might have realized it sooner."

She shook her head. "I have known that I loved you for a long time, months," she said.

"Then you ought to have known I loved you," he answered quickly. "Don't you think it is possible
to love with our souls, our subconsciousness, and realize with our slow brains, after months
and years, what our hearts knew at once? Even love has become more or less of a mental process.
We reason about things instead of feeling them, and yet when we come to our last analyses we
don't know anything; we simply feel. When the scientist says, 'The amoeba moves out of the
shade into the sunlight because it wants the sunlight,' he bases his postulate upon what he
feels, and believes that the atom feels. This is all that he knows. We do not seek warmth because
we have calculated its effects upon us, but because we feel cold. --.

sour, but what molasses came my way.' Never mind, dear. We will go and plant our sugar, and
by the time it is ready to sweeten anything, a whole cargo of lemons may have floated into
harbor right at our door."

They crossed the ranges to the western coast, where there was lower ground, better fitted to
the supposed requirements of rice and cane, and had a good deal of amusement out of their ignorance,
neither of them having more than a misty idea about either rice or sugar before they reach
the stage to be served together.

It was quite late when they were through and camped for supper. Remembering their trip of a
few weeks previous, that now seemed so long ago, Adam said, "Are you too tired to sing, dear?
It is so long since I have heard you."

She stood up and thought for a moment, and then putting back her loosened hair began with Bourdillon's
"The night has a thousand eyes," and sang on and on. At last, turning to Adam with a little
fond gesture, and altering the words slightly, she sang:

    "Like a laverlock in the lift, sing, O bonny bride!
    All the world was Adam once, with Eve by his side.
    What's the world, my lad, my love? What can it do?
    I am thine, and thou art mine; life is sweet and new.
    If the world have missed the mark, let it stand by,
    For we two have gotten leave, and once more we'll try."

"'Once more,'" Adam repeated. "Once more, my darling! Oh, life is sweet and new for us; we
can afford to lose the world! When will you come to me, love, when?"

She shook her head with a little wilful laugh, and all the glistening glory of her hair fell
about her like a wedding veil.

"Wait," she said; "wait a little. The flax is not nearly ready for spinning yet; can a bride
forget her attire? Besides, how can we be--" she paused, and let her silence fill the gap,
"when I know we neither of us know any ceremony more dignified than hopping over a broomstick?"

They started homeward, walking slowly through the dimly lighted mountain gorges, talking the
ineffable nonsense that lovers never weary of. As they came to a brook that rushed noisily
down the ravine, Adam stepped across, and held out his hand to her.

"Wait a moment," he said, "just where you are, dear, and say this with me:--

"'Over running water: my love I give to you, my life I pledge to you, my heart I take not back
from you while this water runs.

"'Over running water: every seventh year, at this time of the year, at this hour of the night,
I will meet you here to renew my troth; death alone to relieve me of this vow.'"

"Is that all?" she asked wonderingly. "Over running water, while this water runs, while there
is any snow in the mountains, or rivers upon land, or waters in the seas, or clouds in the
skies, when the world is old, and the sun burned out, and time grows weary, I shall love you
still, always and forever. What is it all about, love?" He clasped her close, and did not answer
at once. "Don't you know that old Irish troth," he said, "which would have been enough, even
in that hard, unromantic world of ours, to have made you legally my wife, if said over any
Scottish stream? I thought you knew; you are sure I would not trick you? You know I could not?"
He put her head back on his shoulder and looked into her shining eyes. It seemed to him he
could not bear even a look of reproach. She raised her hands almost as if she were placing
an invisible crown upon his head, and let her arms fall about his shoulders.

"Then I am your wife while living water runs?"

"Forever and forever," he replied.

"Oh, wait, wait just a little," she answered.

    BURKE.

Adam found a note beside his plate in the morning. "I will be back before five o'clock," it
said; "I must think." He did not sit down to the table she had spread for him, but called the
dogs; Prince was missing, and this was a relief to him. Nothing could happen to her when Prince
was with her. His first impulse was to follow her, but he repelled it, and he too sat down
to think. Lassie whined uneasily, and he stroked her head absent-mindedly, and finally went
out and tried to work. The hours dragged away, and by four o'clock he could stand it no longer.
He went to the gateway. As he unfastened it, he saw her coming toward him, but she stopped
and he joined her, and together they turned back to the boulder. He noticed that she was very
white, and that her eyes looked as if she had not slept, but he only said, "Have you thought?"

"Yes," she answered, "I have thought."

"And decided?"

"No," she said wearily; "we must decide together. We are not children, Adam, nor are we in
any way the prototypes of those first parents of ours. I think sometimes that ever since their
day their children have been walking in a blind circle, eating not the fruit of knowledge,
but of the knowledge of good and evil. And what do we know, you and I, after all these years?
Are you sure what we ought to do? It is as if God had taken us into a conspiracy to renew the
old, or create a new, scheme of existence. Possibly we are being tried, tested, to prove whether
or not we have learned our lesson. We must be brave enough to think, not what is our will,
but what is our duty. Think of the awful responsibility, whichever way we choose."

"I can't," said Adam. "I can't think of anything but you."

"Nor I of aught but you," she said, moving away, "when you hold me so. But we must think."

"I have," answered Adam, gravely. "All my life I have thought. I have wanted the perfect companionship
of the one woman in all the world who could give it; I have always known she would come. I
have wanted a home; I have wanted to see my sons and daughters grow up about me. I wanted to
be a power for good in this world of which we are a part, and where we live for some good purpose,
if there be any purpose in life. I have so conducted myself that I can look a good woman in
the face, and offer her my life, for whatever it is worth, without damning recollections to
come between us. My children will have a clean heritage of blood and name. The family tree
was scoffed at in America, but, thank God, mine was an oak that had weathered many a gale.
Not very great folk, but honest, upright, fearless men and women, true to their king or their
country and their faiths; true to their ideals, too, when their fellows were content with realities
only. Any man who gives his children such a heritage as that can say with more truth than Napoleon
said to his soldiers, 'Fifty centuries look down upon you.' I wanted to make the world a little
better for my life, and I wanted my children brought up to feel that their lives belonged first
to their country, to live or die for her."

"I know," said Robin, softly; "I used to think I would drape the flag over my baby's cradle,
and embroider it on his pinning blanket."

"We are probably a pair of sentimental fools," he went on, "but I believe in sentiment. A man
could not say this out loud because sentiment was supposed to be essentially womanish. How
those old distinctions weary one, with their scientific data to prove that men surpass women
in the senses of feeling and taste, while women have better sight and hearing, and so on through
every conceivable maundering of the human brain, forever harping on differences and accentuating
them, forever dwelling on sex distinctions and never on a common humanity."

"It was a dreadfully scientific age," she assented, "a generation fearfully and wonderfully
given over to statistics; and yet how many dreamers there were!"

"Yes, but in the twentieth century a young man dreamed dreams and saw visions at his own risk.
While he dreamed of the brotherhood of man, his classmate with the corporation practice distanced
him in the pursuit of position. While he led himself through the valley of the shadow of temptation,
and feared no evil because of the Madonna vision in his soul, even the Madonnas preferred Lancelot
and Tristram to Galahad. It wasn't an easy world for a man who wanted to keep faith with himself.
It was a pinchbeck world, of pretence and pull,--that world that lies drowned out there. And
yet I believe it was infinitely better than the lost Atlantis, better than the deluged planet
of Noah, nobler and finer than the best civilization of which we have any trace. I never despaired
of it, and yet as I grew older I wondered if I was not foolish and mistaken in daring to hope
and to dream."

"I know," she said again. "I think I did despair, for it seemed to me a dreadful, a terrible
world. I used to wonder how conscientious men and women could bring other human beings into
it, to be and to suffer and to faint in the frantic struggle for the unrealities that made
us miserable or happy. Consider how paltry they were. If we built a new house, we were infinitely
more concerned to see that the contractor used pressed brick than we were to see that the construction
of our own characters was true. When we grew wealthy we moved into houses of more stories;
but how often did we say: 'Build thee more stately mansions, O my soul'? I had as clean and
strong a heritage as you, but a different one. It is no use to comfort oneself with nice little
aphorisms about the needle's eye, and saws about filthy lucre, and telling God's estimate of
money from the kind of people He gives it to; I tell you biting poverty is a terrible thing,
an unspeakable thing. It is a misfortune for a child to grow up under a sense of injustice.
I used to have times of revolt against it all, when I hated with the blind, ferocious hate
of a child, and I saw what David never saw,--the righteous forsaken, and his seed begging,
not bread, but a chance to earn his bread, and begging for it without being able to make just
terms. I saw my home sold under the sheriff's hammer, and my parents struggle all their lives
because of the lack of money, when they had everything else, nobility, character, truth, and
education. My girlhood was a long series of going-withouts. Finally I married a man who promised
me everything. Ah, well, when has the Apple of Sodom failed to deceive the eye and undeceive
the tongue? At least he did care for my voice, and through that I learned that all those years
I had carried in my own throat the golden notes to have altered everything, and I sang a little
gladness into my parents' lives before they ended, thank God."

"How did you come to sing in opera? Do not tell me if the recollection is unpleasant. I wondered
then."

"Because after--after things went wrong, I could not take his money. I knew how to sing, and
I loved it; but even there it was the same story of suspicion and jealousy, till it seemed
to me that hate and fear ruled the world. I went to so many, many cities, but there was no
city beautiful, and in all the country I found no Arcady. I had money then, it is true; but
the jingle of the guinea doesn't help the artist who sings, or paints, or writes, or plays,
because God has put it into his soul to do this thing; at least not after the very first, when
it stands as a tangible assurance of success. The cities were 'cities of dreadful night,' and
awful days; there were places that were not hives, but styes of human beings, fighting for
what they called life, to die, never having lived. Sometimes I went into those jungles of civilization
and sang to them. It was the only thing I could give them all. It was there I got my lesson.
I had been singing 'All Tears,' when an old woman said in her feeble, trembling voice, 'Ye
mun loe us, young leddy, to come to sic a place an' sing o' Him wha sa loed the warld that
He sent His only begotten Son ta it, for it's only great loe that casts out fear, and this
is a fearsome spot.' Since then I haven't hated anything, except wanton cruelty, and I know
love rules when it is fearless, but that is very seldom. We were afraid to say, I love you,
to anything more sensitive than a stray kitten, though the world has hungered and thirsted
after the love we have feared to give even to our own children. And yet just the love a man
and woman may bear each other, unconsciously, is enough to transform the earth. We have not
been cross to each other; I do not believe we have spoken unkindly to anything this year."

He drew her into his arms. "Is it enough to regenerate the earth?"

"And keep it regenerated?" she echoed. "Do you know?"

"Do you remember telling me, long ago, of a story in which the woman said she had never seen
but one man whose mother she would be willing to be? And you said you felt so about me? I was
very proud of it then, but I am prouder of it now, since, feeling so, you cannot be unwilling
to be the mother of my children. You are not, are you?"

She nestled a little closer to him, and put her hand about his neck. He stooped and kissed
it, and repeated his question.

"Unwilling? No; how could I be? I never dreaded maternity except when--and that lasted such
a little while. I do not dread it now. It seems to me it would be a blessed thing for us. But,
Adam, Adam, tell me, for I have sat here all day asking myself, whether it is a blessed thing
to be born, or a penalty that others pay."

"I think it would be a blessing to be your son," he said steadily.

"And I think it would be a benediction to be yours," she answered; "but he would not be yours
nor mine, but ours, plus everything in the past, verily heir of all the ages, and the ages
were full of pain and sorrow. Oh," she said passionately, "could you and I who love him so,
this son who is only our wish, could you and I who know the weight of this weary world, bind
it upon the shoulders of our baby boy, and send him staggering down the centuries, the new
Atlas of this old earth?"

They sat in silence for a long time. Then Adam said slowly, "I don't know, dearest; but I do
know that you are tired and hungry, and I am going to take you home."

They rose and disappeared through the gateway together.

XVII

    Love gives us a sort of religion of our own; we respect
    another life in ourselves.

    BALZAC.

Robin was shelling peas. Adam was reading her the story of their deluge. He paused, dissatisfied,
and said impatiently,--

"I have not described it at all. I have said all I had to say in less than a thousand words;
one would think such a scene deserved a hundred thousand."

Robin smiled her little inscrutable smile. "I think you have done it very well. It isn't intended
to be scientific. You haven't told all the strata that were turned skyward for a moment when
that crevasse opened between us and the town. You will find, if you turn to the first chapter
of Genesis, that there is very little detail; but I am sure that the one line, 'He made the
stars also,' is as eloquent as a treatise on the nebular theory. If you were learned in geology
and astronomy and so on, you would load it down with an avalanche of scientific hypotheses,
about which you would really know nothing, except by deduction, and over which future scientists
would wrangle, part of them making you a god, and the rest proving you a fool. Be content to
'climb where Moses stood,' and produce literature."

    "'Why should an author fret about The judgment of posterity?
    It is not, and it never was, And it, perhaps, may never
    be,'"

quoted Adam, cynically. "I wonder what they will call us, Robin, and who will lecture on my
mistakes in seven or eight thousand years, and show how it never could have happened. Do you
suppose there is any one else on earth? Did the Atlantis people leave any literature behind them?"

Robin shook her head. "Who really knows? God has not left Himself without a witness, at any
time. In some way the story of creation has gone on and on. Every nation has its Eden and flood
and Saviour. Esther was the first, I think, to have her wish granted 'even to the half of my
kingdom,' and all the fairy stories since have borrowed the phrase. Cinderella is almost as
old as Job; and the Irish, the Fenians, claim that Cadmus, the Phoenician, was one of their
forebears. Wide as race distinctions were, there were strange and almost unaccountable similarities."

She went indoors to see to her baking, and coming back went on with her work. Adam watched
her silently for awhile, and then said curiously, "I wonder what you have missed most this year?"

"Pins and needles, and until Christmas, books and shoes and stockings and sugar and a cook-stove
and a piano," answered Robin, promptly. "I can live without the opera and a telephone, but
if you only knew how I cherish my stock of pins, and with what dread I look forward to the
day when, like a poor white trash family I used to know, I shall refer to the needle. I used
to think you could do anything with a pair of pliers and a bit of wire, but I tremble lest
you may not be able to compass a needle." She looked up, and seeing Adam's troubled face said
quickly, "Forgive me for being frivolous; I am so happy, I can't help it. What were you thinking
of, Adam?"

He got up and walked away a few yards, and cut one of the long thick yucca leaves, and stripped
it down to the central spine, while he went on speaking to her. "I was thinking," he said,
"of what Mill said about inventions, and how they hadn't helped the laboring man; that they
had neither decreased his number of working hours, nor increased his comforts, and wondering
whether it would be better for a new race to find an electric light plant alongside their other
plants, or whether they would better work out their own salvation, a little at a time, by main
strength and awkwardness. I was thinking how strange our books would seem to men and women
who knew nothing of the--the late earth." He held out to her what looked something like a needle
threaded with coarse white linen thread. "Will your Majesty deign to look at this?"

She took it, and looked at it wonderingly, and then ran in and brought back a torn towel, and
began mending it. "Why, it sews very well," she said; "who taught you that?"

"The mother of inventions generally," he answered. "If you ever had gone on the round-up, you
might have had occasion for a needle and thread when there wasn't any nearer than a hundred
miles. But you haven't answered my question."

"About inventions and so on? It seems to me you have to consider the raison d'être of a people
before you can tell the answer. What is the use of labor-saving inventions, if the time saved
isn't of some great value? What is to be the chief end of man in a dispensation that has no
catechism as a guide-post?"

"A very different end from the old one," answered Adam, half sternly. "Work should not come
to him as a curse, nor as his greatest boon; at least, not hard, manual labor. There should
be work enough to insure ease and comfort, and every one should work freely and gladly. I should
educate the individual; he should be strong of body and keen of mind, and should feel that
his talents were given him for use, not for concealment; he should use his hands, both of them,
and find delight in their work. It is a beautiful world, it always was, but I don't know that
the steam-engine brought men's souls closer together, or that the electric light let in any
more radiance upon our minds, or that the great telescopes made heaven any nearer. It should
be a happier and a healthier world, if it was no more."

"Adam," she said abruptly, "if we had children, in what religious faith would you bring them up?"

"I don't know; I never thought about it very much," he answered honestly. "I have an ideal
in my mind, but I can't explain it. I believe in one source of life, and therefore a common
divinity."

Robin laughed quietly. "That is like the Hindoo proverb, 'That which exists is one; sages call
it variously.' That has been called pantheism, and for that belief the Jews expelled Baruch
Benedict Spinoza from their synagogue. In our time there was a very learned magazine published
in its behalf, and I heard David Starr Jordan say no man could tell whether it was a mere jargon
of words, meaningless and empty, or whether monism was the profoundest philosophy the world
has ever known."

"I don't care what you call it," said Adam, stoutly. "I am not afraid of names, and I don't
know anything about any of those religions, pantheism, Spinozaism, or monism; but I do know
I would rather a child of mine saw God in everything than that he saw God in nothing save his
own narrow creed. I would rather he was a pantheist than a Calvinist. Spinoza never burned
any one, did he, nor preached that hell was paved with infants' skulls?"

Robin clapped her hands and laughed again. "I beg your pardon for laughing," she said, "but
the idea of Spinoza, the 'God-intoxicated man,' presiding over an auto-da-fé is too absurd.
If you only remembered anything about his gentle, retiring spirit and melancholy life; I think
he was better known in our time than in his own, but his philosophy does not satisfy me. I
am willing to grant the identity of life, and its divine possibilities, but I cannot worship
it as life itself, a mere manifestation of nature. I know that there is such a thing as living
rock, and that it may be killed by a bolt of lightning as readily as a tree; but this does
not make it any more worthy of worship than I am, and that is terribly unworthy. The rock and
I are types of life, stages in the development of life, but for my child there must be something
better. For the child I must lay hold on the everlasting life; I must find the rock that is
higher than I. I do not know of any manifestation of that life so great, so godlike, and so
lovable as His who said, 'I am the way, the truth, and the life.'"

"But surely you do not believe in the Immaculate Conception?" asked Adam, incredulously.

"I don't care anything about it, one way or the other. It's the immaculate life that concerns
me. As you said yourself a few minutes ago, words cannot frighten me. Am I going to stand carping,
'Can any good come out of Nazareth?' What do I care if it comes out of Sodom and Gomorrah,
if it is good?"

"But you surely don't believe in the miracles?" he asked.

"Surely I do, in some of them at least. I have seen a miracle or so myself. Besides, if you
remember the greatest proof He gave was that the gospel was preached to the poor. Buddha was
a prince; he whom the Jews expected was to reign as a king. What a fall was there! the gospel
of hope and joy was brought to the children of Gibeon, the hewers of wood and drawers of water.
The love of Christ has wrought greater miracles than He did. Look at the arena in Rome. Look
at the whole countless army of martyrs. When Mrs. Booth died, the eighty thousand women that
nightly walked the streets of London rebelled, and for once the long aisles of brick and stone
were swept clean of that awful arraignment of civilization. That was more of a miracle than
satisfying three thousand souls with food. At least, it's enough of a miracle for me."

The tears came into her eyes, and she gathered up her pans and went into the house.

    TENNYSON.

They were sitting in the doorway together. Robin rested her chin in her hands and looked down
the valley, the lines of perplexity deepening in her forehead.

"If only we had an angel with a sword, or without one, to tell us what to do," she said. "If
only we were deeply religious with the old-fashioned orthodox religion, that would enable us
to believe we were predestined not to be drowned--"

"Or if we believed in a personal God, without whom not a sparrow falleth, though the waters
cover the face of the earth and blot out millions of His creatures," answered Adam. "After
all, can we do better than follow the dictates of Nature?"

"Do you mean to look through Nature up to Nature's God?" answered Robin. "How can we worship
any God as pitiless as Nature? Nature is strong, but is it our place to help her in her care
for the single type? Perhaps we are the trilobites of a new Silurian period; well, trilobites
were painfully common, but we need not be. Nature's laws are immutable, so we have been told
with wearying insistence, but suppose you and I have wills as strong as Nature herself? Suppose
we ask what she has done for the humanity of which we are a part, that she should demand fresh
victims from us? Where are the crowns now, and how can we say Solomon was not right when he
said the end of it all was vanity? What is Nature, and on what compulsion must we obey her?
The imperative mandates of our own hearts? But what if our hearts are at war with our heads?
Are we to follow no higher law than the blind instinct that moves the house-fly? Or will we
aspire to the indomitable soul of the mocking-birds that feed their young in captivity until
they see they are prisoners for life, and then bring them poisonous spiders that they may die
rather than live under such conditions? Shall we give hostages to Nature when she has given
nothing to us?"

She was standing now and speaking with more vehemence than was her wont. Adam caught her hands,
as she flung them out with a gesture full of scorn.

"Do you really think we have nothing? How many million lovers have envied Adam and Eve their
paradise? This Nature against which you bring so railing an accusation,--has she taken away
more than she has given us? We had ambitions, you and I, but the way of ambition is full of
weariness and disappointment and bitterness of spirit. We did not expect peace and comfort
and joy, but work and turmoil. Our slates were set with a sum--"

"Yes, a sum in vulgar fractions," answered Robin.

"Perhaps; it was a sum in which the unknown and unknowable quantity determined the result.
We had seen a good deal of what is called life,--it is a good name to distinguish it from the
death it so much resembles,--and I am half inclined to think Nature has been merciful."

"But if she was merciful to them," said Robin, quickly, "why were we omitted?"

"She gave them oblivion, the hereafter, whatever comes hereafter. She gave us each other. We
were going to miss one another in the careers we had mapped out. We might have lost each other
forever, or for æons of years. Nothing but a general breaking up of everything would ever have
flung us into each other's arms. We were too much interested in my career, my vast influence
on the political situation, to consider any existence apart from the setting we had chosen
for the play. And, after all, what was it, that career from which we hoped so much? I stood
waiting my cue, ready to act my part in the farce or tragedy, whichever it turned out to be."

"I think it was more like a circus," said Robin.

"Very like a circus," he admitted with grim appreciation. "A circus in which no one knew whether
he was to be a ringmaster or a clown. There were the financial tight-rope walkers, and the
social lion-tamers, and snake-charmers, and the political acrobats whose falls were unsoftened
by any kind of network. There were heat and dust and discomfort, and weary, wretched animals
looking out of cages at other weary, tortured animals, that were sometimes scarcely less pachydermatous
than themselves. I know the program we had mapped out, the triumphal entry, the daring leaps,
the cheers,--but was it worth while? After all, does one care to be the champion bareback rider
in life's hippodrome? Nature swept away my sawdust ring, but she gave me heaven for a canopy,
earth for an arena, you for a queen. At times I am disposed to take a fatalist view of the
case, and think that God, or Nature, knew there was no more to be done with the earth, not
so much because of its wickedness, as on account of its stupidity and cruelty. All my plans
had centered in a political career, and yet how could a man touch politics and remain undefiled?
Yes, I know there were honorable men in politics, but they were lonely, and they hated with
an unspeakable hatred all the means that were used to keep them there. And there were any number
of men who had been honorable once. When a man becomes possessed by the desire of place, his
backbone becomes elastic, and he stoops to things of which he had believed himself incapable.
I don't know what it is, but it weakens a man's moral fibre, and breaks down the tissues of
his will, and gives him mental astigmatism. How dare I say I should have been any better than
the rest?"

"Do you remember your address, a year ago Flag Day, and the old man with the little bronze
button of the Civil War veteran, who stood in front, and shook hands with you afterwards, with
tears running down his face? And the applause? Can you honestly say that you find 'to utter
love more sweet than praise'? You have told me of your dream of a home, but Emerson said, 'not
even a home in the heart of one we love can satisfy the awful soul that dwells in clay.' Can
it satisfy you, who hoped and expected so much?"

He hesitated and did not reply at once.

"Are you sure you are not making a virtue of necessity?" she asked a little bitterly.

"I think as much as anything," he said slowly, "I was excusing myself for not having known
all along that the real life, and the most useful one, is the one we could have made together.
Principalities and powers and empires and republics have fallen. When God wants to regenerate
the world, He begins with the family. Now I," with unspeakable scorn,--"I intended to begin
with a different primary law. I could have made a good home, but I was intent on making an
indifferent, honest congressman, or senator, or perhaps president. In a way your home always
meant a good deal of what I am trying to say. You always had some one on hand you were trying
to make capable of great things by believing in them. You made us welcome, and were ready to
listen to our troubles, our literary curiosities, our musical gems and our aspirations. Suppose
I had had sense enough to refuse the husks and choose--"

"Don't say it," she answered. "Don't say it, even if you mean it, for I should have sent you
away, and have felt like reviling you for putting your hand to the plow and turning back. Your
ambitions were the most attractive thing about you then. I hadn't pinned my faith on a primary
law; I think it was government ownership that I regarded as the great regenerator. I am glad
if my home seemed homelike to any one; it never reached my ideal; and when a woman's home isn't
the hub of her universe,--well, she takes to china painting, or gossip, or philanthropy; a
man takes to poker or politics. I took to politics, second-hand. Personally and concretely
I abhorred the whole miserable farce, but abstractly, and as a means to an end which I greatly
desired, I found it interesting. I admired you infinitely more than I liked you in those days,
but I wouldn't have married you under any circumstances."

"Why?"

"First, because I didn't want to marry any one; I didn't want to care that much. And, secondly,
because I wanted you to devote yourself to your country, and had you possessed a family your
devotion would have been divided. I don't see," she went on reflectively, "how you, who know
so well how empty it all was, and how hopeless the endeavor to lift it an inch,--I don't see
how you can think anything would justify us in making it go on."

 We had overcome the sharpness of death, but whence could we
hope for deliverance from the sharpness of living?"

"We have been delivered," said Adam, slowly, "but you don't seem disposed to be the Miriam
of this Israel--limited."

"Well, no," answered Robin. "I should like to believe that you and I were rewarded for our
superhuman excellence by being saved when Pharaoh and his multitudes went under, but a somewhat
wide acquaintance with other people forbids. On the other hand, we can't have been left on
account of our superlative badness. Truly, Adam, don't you feel sometimes as if you would rather
have died with the rest?"

He hesitated. The question was so unexpected, and so fraught with possibilities. She watched
the struggle in his face and honored him for it. He put back a stray lock of hair and kissed
her forehead before he answered.

"The streak of cowardice that we all of us have in us," he said finally, "the distrust of myself,
and the doubt of all systems of life of which I know anything, prompts me to answer yes; for
I think even if we had died, you and I would still be together. I think sometimes we have been,
in the past, but whether we have or not, I know we shall be in the future. So while the mental
part of me,--which it seems to me is the weakest and most contemptible part of man, because
it is always reasoning him out of what his soul tells him is true,--while the mental part of
me might find it easier to be dead than to know what we ought to do, everything else in me
rejoices. I know that in the great plan we have a part, it seems to me a very happy and beautiful
part. In all our world there is no cause for anger or hatred or sin. There is friendliness
and content and gentleness and love all around us; look up, dear, and see how near heaven seems."

But though she looked up, she saw only the light in his eyes.

    "We're all for love," the violins said.

    SIDNEY LANIER.

Robin's music was a source of great delight to both of them. There was such a sense of time,
infinite and unlimited, that they ceased to be the hurrying mortals of earth. The joy of life
crept into their hearts, and they grew young with the new world.

One evening they watched the full moon come up over the mountains. She had been playing a few
desultory airs, and looking up asked,--

"Who is it says 'music is love in search of a word'?"

"If you don't know, I'm sure I don't," answered Adam, laughing. "Do you know that you quote
entirely too much?"

"Oh, yes," she said lightly. "I always knew that if I ever should break into print, the critics,
supposing they ever deigned to notice me, would say, as they said of Lubbock's 'Beauties of
Life,' that it wasn't a book, but a compendium of useful quotations. But do you really dislike
quoting? I think it takes as much or nearly as much originality to quote well as to invent."

"Oh, no!" he interposed.

"No? Well, it seems so to me. I think the thing first myself, that is original so far as I
am concerned, though it may be old as the hills, and then it comes to me afterward, in a dozen
ways, perhaps, as other people have said it. I realize that in the kaleidoscope of life the
pattern before my mind's eye approximates that which others have seen. We don't say a man knows
too many synonyms or antonyms, and I don't see much difference."

"I have a misty memory that quotation is said to be a confession of inferiority," answered Adam.

"That's Emerson," she said, laughing; "but he also says, 'genius borrows nobly,' and I am willing
to confess inferiority to a great many people; all that implies is that one should only quote
well. If it wasn't that I'm not sure of the words, and that I can't verify them, I should confound
you with a citation from Disraeli."

"Go on," said Adam, lazily; "I don't mind being crushed."

"It is to the effect that people think that where there is no quotation there must be great
originality. Now are you answered?" She laughed gleefully. "It is delicious to disagree with
you. I had almost forgotten that it was possible."

He echoed her laugh with the carefree heartiness of a boy. "I am going to make a riddle," he
said. "Prepare yourself; this is the first conundrum of the new world. Why is it better to
disagree than to differ?"

She made a little grimace. "It's a wonder the Sphinx does not rise from the other side of the
world and eat you," she said with derision. "Anybody who loved anybody could answer such a
poor little excuse for a riddle as that; besides, it sounds like an extract from somebody's
'First Easy Lessons in Rhetoric.' Don't you see that I can disagree with you, while I must
differ from you? That is too disgracefully easy. Indeed, Adam, that riddle of yours brings
back every doubt, for they say--scientists and ologists and learned people, you know--that
there is hope for delinquents and defectives, but none for degenerates, and that is an awfully
degenerate joke."

"Play for me," he said, "and don't call names."

She lifted the bow and drew it across the strings in a series of cadences so wildly mournful
that he shuddered. She put the bow down, and laid her hand upon the strings to still them.
In the old days she had been given to sudden changes of mood, but of late she had been almost
serene.

"What is it?" he asked gently.

"Oh, nothing,--everything! I was thinking of another thing which those wise ones said," she
answered, with more bitterness than she had shown for many months. "It was that word 'degenerate'
brought it back. You know birds are a very low order of being, a branch of the reptile family,
in truth, and I have heard people say that musicians are generally lacking in something. They
either have no moral or financial sense, and cannot be bound by ordinary rules. And I am musical
to the very tips of my fingers. It is as if I could hear the song of the silence,--I feel its
vibrations like those of a great organ."

She walked up and down, her hands back of her head, and the moonlight shining on her upturned,
troubled face.

"There is another scientific fact you forget," he said.

She stopped to listen, and he went on.

"When a race has run its course, nature cries 'habet,' and nothing can alter its fate. It was
not alone the merciless onslaughts of the white man that exterminated the buffalo. They died,
and none came to take their places. They vanished, less on account of man's cruelty than by
reason of their own sterility. Degenerates or regenerates, can't we leave the decision with
a power that forever builds or destroys, in accordance with a law we do not understand, a higher
law that comes from the source of all law, whatever that source may be? Don't think any more,
but play for me. In spite of my lecture, I will quote too; my mother used to sing a hymn that
went like this,--

    'I'd soar and touch the heavenly strings,
    And vie with Gabriel while he sings,'--

Do you know it?"

She began the old tune, "Ariel," and then wandered on, playing many airs that brought back
forgotten days. Adam threw himself down on the grass to listen, half jealously, for she seemed
to forget everything. She had seated herself on a great boulder, and, leaning back against
it, her eyes looking into the blue depths above her, she played on and on. The old tunes were
merged in new ones, and the high sustained notes of the Cavalleria, the subtle minor of Wagner,
the exquisite sweetness of Beethoven and Schubert filled the moonlit cañon, and still she played
on, melodies new to Adam, intoxicating, full of a wild ecstasy, that filled his very soul,
and thrilled through him till he felt all power of resistance swept away. Every other desire
in the world was lost in the supreme and overwhelming longing to gather her to his heart and
hold her there forever. The very air was steeped in melody. The full majestic chords rose and
melted in unison with the high, exquisitely sweet notes, and throbbed their life away. She
held the bow suspended a moment, then very softly, half unconsciously, played a dreamy lullaby,
and laid the violin down in her lap.

Adam took her and it into his arms.

"Be careful, put it down gently," she said faintly; "it is your soul and mine. Do you not know
the secret of Antonio Stradivari, of all the great makers of violins? Ah, they solved our riddle,
Love, ages ago. Do you not remember the story of Jacob Steiner, and how he spent days and days
in the woods, selecting the trees for his violins, and how the spirits of the trees revenged
themselves by telling him of their ruined lives till he went mad?"

"But there was no madness in this music," Adam answered, "except, except--"

"The supreme, sublime madness of love? Do you not know, surely you do, that every perfect violin
is as much man and woman as you and I? The back of the violin is made from the timber of the
female tree, the belly of the male tree. The harmony depends on their vibrations, as they clasp
each other in an embrace as real--"

"As this," he cried, drawing her closer, and bending his handsome head until their lips met.
"Sweet, must I envy that violin?"

He felt her heart beating wildly against his own, their arms closed around each other convulsively.
The sweetness of the music-laden, flower-scented air filled his senses.

"God! how I love you!" he said.

A frightened look came into her eyes, and she struggled, for a moment, futilely.

"Let me go!" she whispered; "let me go!"

"Do you want me to?" he answered, studying her face in the moonlight.

"No," she said. "No, never again, but, oh, Adam!"

XXII

    I'm weary of conjectures--this must end them.

    ADDISON.

Adam had to go to the cane-fields across the range, and one of the calves needed Robin's ministrations,
so she could not go with him. He started before the stars were set, that he might be back before
night, and returned twice to kiss her before he finally got away.

Left with the long day ahead of her, restless and lonely, she gave the small house a thorough
sweeping and cleaning. She had finished her dusting, and was rearranging the furniture, when
she shoved back the long chest and struck the framework of the window with some little violence.
It was enough to jar a rusty key from its place above the casement, and it dropped upon the
chest with a kind of ominous clink as it struck the lock, and fell upon the floor. She took
it up and looked at it curiously, and then, kneeling, fitted it in the lock.

"I wonder," she mused, "what I shall set free if I open this box; is it Pandora's? But there
was nothing left in hers but hope, and that is all we need. How happy we could be if we dared
to hope!"

She turned the key with a wrench, and the hasp shot from its place. The chest was nearly empty,
there being but one parcel in it. This was done up carefully in a square of linen, pinned here
and there. On the bottom of the chest were several folds of white paper. Very slowly she lifted
out the parcel and opened it. The treasure was a gown; it was of a heavy, satiny weave of linen,
very yellow and creased. The bodice was made without sleeves or neck, and the skirt was a kind
of kilt plaited affair; the whole effect was Greek, and, simple as it was, it seemed beautiful
to Robin after her year of dark, utilitarian clothing. There was white underwear, and even
white stockings, and a pair of slippers.

Robin drew a long breath of delight, and laying all her finery upon the table placed the irons
over the tripod that she might smooth the wrinkles out, and set about making the necessary
alterations at once. She worked rapidly in spite of her excitement, but the hours slipped away.

"I must try it on," she said, "before Adam comes; there will be plenty of time, and then I
will put it away until--"

Shroud or wedding-gown? She did not finish the sentence. She dressed slowly; but when she had
finished she was startled to see that the image in the glass was so much fairer than she had
ever thought herself. Suddenly she discovered, with something like a pang, that there was no
belt, and hurried back to the chest to look again.

As she twitched out the remaining layer of paper in her eagerness, a long white satin ribbon
dropped from it, and a little heap of fine muslin lay on the floor of the chest. She caught
up the ribbon with an exclamation of delight and adjusted it with trembling fingers. Her flushed
cheeks and radiant eyes, the long heavy braid of hair, her round white arms and shoulders,
made her a vision of delight indeed. Hundred establish that, in south there is to pad the despotism

the french had make themselves masters of dangerous, Flanders, and Adam, the government said themselves

The settlers who had their jointure had admitted, the agnomen clergy were driven up and irish sympathisers

 We are only one being, separated God knows how long, but united now forever.
Nothing can part us again."

He stopped and held out his arms to her. He had taken her into their shelter very often, but
now he wanted her to come to him and nestle against his heart of her own will. She took a single
step, stretching out her arms to him with a gesture of infinite trust and abandon. The long
sheer dress fluttered down to the floor, and lay between them.

They stood as still as if frozen.

"Dare you cross it?" she said, and hid her face in her hands.

He stooped and picked it up, and looked at it as a man might look at the soul of something
of which he had never seen the body. He had a sense of his own strength, the glory of his manhood,
and a vision of his weakness. She watched him breathlessly. He put the garment down on the
table and smoothed it out gently. There was in his face the combined look of a man who sees
the cradle and the coffin of his firstborn.

She went and stood beside him, touching the dress timidly. He covered her hand with his own.

"My wife," he said, "we know all there is to say, all there is to risk. We must do what is
right. I am going now to set everything at liberty. It is nearly sundown; you will meet me
at the rock in half an hour. If we give each other our right hands, we will fear no evil, not
though we walk through the valley of the shadow of death, for the love in our hearts is deathless,
and though the sun sets, it is to rise upon another shore. Death is only an incident, but life
is eternal."

"We could not choose differently?" And though she spoke with the upward inflection it was not
a question.

"No, it would be quite impossible for either of us to desire what the other did not. And much
as we love each other, we will know we have loved our race and honored God first in our decision.
To live, if we live, not for ourselves alone, but for the good of our kind; to renounce love,
the unspeakable gift, if need be, for the sake of what seems to us right."

"And if I give you my left hand--?"

The sudden flash of light in his eyes half blinded her.

The sun dropped lower and lower over the high sharp peaks at the west, covering their white
summits with a flood of golden glory. The sullen roar of the ocean seemed hushed, and across
its wide expanse the last beams of the setting sun made radiant pathways of crimson and gold.
A lark far up in the heavens sang its few clear notes as it hastened homeward. Far away on
the mountain-side the cattle lay placidly, and a mare whinnied to her colt. The air was soft
and warm and drowsy with the scent of many flowers, the sounds of nestling birds, the drone
of an insect here and there, the cheerful call of the crickets.

Adam stood by the rock and waited for her. She came toward him, all the light of the world
seeming to fall upon her and circle her in a halo that transformed her white draperies, and
glistened like a million gems in the sparse grass about her feet.

They made each other no greeting, but stood and looked into each other's eyes, grave and sweet
with the exaltation of their purpose. And, standing so, they clasped hands, and the word they
spoke was the same, for they by searching had found out God.
