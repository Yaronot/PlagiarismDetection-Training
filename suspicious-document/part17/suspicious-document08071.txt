(23) In order, therefore, to set forth the whole matter methodically, I will begin with a definition
of faith, which on the principle above given, should be as follows:-

(24) Faith consists in a knowledge of God, without which obedience to Him would be impossible,
and which the mere fact of obedience to Him implies. (25) This definition is so clear, and
follows so plainly from what we have already proved, that it needs no explanation. (26) The
consequences involved therein I will now briefly show.

(27) (I.) Faith is not salutary in itself, but only in respect to the obedience it implies,
or as James puts it in his Epistle, ii:17, "Faith without works is dead" (see the whole of
the chapter quoted).

(28) (II.) He who is truly obedient necessarily possesses true and saving faith; for if obedience
be granted, faith must be granted also, as the same Apostle expressly says in these words (ii:18),
"Show me thy faith without thy works, and I will show thee my faith by my works." (30) From
these texts, I repeat, it follows that we can only judge a man faithful or unfaithful by his
works. (31) If his works be good, he is faithful, however much his doctrines may differ from
those of the rest of the faithful: if his works be evil, though he may verbally conform, he
is unfaithful. (32) For obedience implies faith, and faith without works is dead.

(33) John, in the 13th verse of the chapter above quoted, expressly teaches the same doctrine:
"Hereby," he says, "know we that we dwell in Him and He in us, because He hath given us of
His Spirit," i.e. love. (34) He had said before that God is love, and therefore he concludes
(on his own received principles), that whoso possesses love possesses truly the Spirit of God.
(35) As no one has beheld God he infers that no one has knowledge or consciousness of God,
except from love towards his neighbour, and also that no one can have knowledge of any of God's
attributes, except this of love, in so far as we participate therein.

(36) If these arguments are not conclusive, they, at any rate, show the Apostle's meaning,
but the words in chap. ii:3, 4, of the same Epistle are much clearer, for they state in so
many words our precise contention: "And hereby we do know that we know Him, if we keep His
commandments. (37) He that saith, I know Him, and keepeth not His commandments, is a liar,
and the truth is not in him."

(38) From all this, I repeat, it follows that they are the true enemies of Christ who persecute
honourable and justice-loving men because they differ from them, and do not uphold the same
religious dogmas as themselves: for whosoever loves justice and charity we know, by that very
fact, to be faithful: whosoever persecutes the faithful, is an enemy to Christ.

(39) Lastly, it follows that faith does not demand that dogmas should be true as that they
should be pious - that is, such as will stir up the heart to obey; though there be many such
which contain not a shadow of truth, so long as they be held in good faith, otherwise their
adherents are disobedient, for how can anyone, desirous of loving justice and obeying God,
adore as Divine what he knows to be alien from the Divine nature? (40) However, men may err
from simplicity of mind, and Scripture, as we have seen, does not condemn ignorance, but obstinacy.
(41) This is the necessary result of our definition of faith, and all its branches should spring
from the universal rule above given, and from the evident aim and object of the Bible, unless
we choose to mix our own inventions therewith. (42) Thus it is not true doctrines which are
expressly required by the Bible, so much as doctrines necessary for obedience, and to confirm
in our hearts the love of our neighbour, wherein (to adopt the words of John) we are in God,
and God in us.

(43) As, then, each man's faith must be judged pious or impious only in respect of its producing
obedience or obstinacy, and not in respect of its truth; and as no one will dispute that men's
dispositions are exceedingly varied, that all do not acquiesce in the same things, but are
ruled some by one opinion some by another, so that what moves one to devotion moves another
to laughter and contempt, it follows that there can be no doctrines in the Catholic, or universal,
religion, which can give rise to controversy among good men. (44) Such doctrines might be pious
to some and impious to others, whereas they should be judged solely by their fruits.

(45) To the universal religion, then, belong only such dogmas as are absolutely required in
order to attain obedience to God, and without which such obedience would be impossible; as
for the rest, each man - seeing that he is the best judge of his own character should adopt
whatever he thinks best adapted to strengthen his love of justice. (46) If this were so, I
think there would be no further occasion for controversies in the Church.

(47) I have now no further fear in enumerating the dogmas of universal faith or the fundamental
dogmas of the whole of Scripture, inasmuch as they all tend (as may be seen from what has been
said) to this one doctrine, namely, that there exists a God, that is, a Supreme Being, Who
loves justice and charity, and Who must be obeyed by whosoever would be saved; that the worship
of this Being consists in the practice of justice and love towards one's neighbour, and that
they contain nothing beyond the following doctrines :-

(48) I. That God or a Supreme Being exists, sovereignly just and merciful, the Exemplar of
the true life; that whosoever is ignorant of or disbelieves in His existence cannot obey Him
or know Him as a Judge.

(49) II. That He is One. (50) Nobody will dispute that this doctrine is absolutely necessary
for entire devotion, admiration, and love towards God. (51) For devotion, admiration, and love
spring from the superiority of one over all else.

(52) III. That He is omnipresent, or that all things are open to Him, for if anything could
be supposed to be concealed from Him, or to be unnoticed by, Him, we might doubt or be ignorant
of the equity of His judgment as directing all things.

(53) IV. That He has supreme right and dominion over all things, and that He does nothing under
compulsion, but by His absolute fiat and grace. (54) All things are bound to obey Him, He is
not bound to obey any.

(55) V. That the worship of God consists only in justice and charity, or love towards one's
neighbour.

(56) VI. That all those, and those only, who obey God by their manner of life are saved; the
rest of mankind, who live under the sway of their pleasures, are lost. (57) If we did not believe
this, there would be no reason for obeying God rather than pleasure.

(58) VII. Lastly, that God forgives the sins of those who repent. (59) No one is free from
sin, so that without this belief all would despair of salvation, and there would be no reason
for believing in the mercy of God. (60) He who firmly believes that God, out of the mercy and
grace with which He directs all things, forgives the sins of men, and who feels his love of
God kindled thereby, he, I say, does really, know Christ according to the Spirit, and Christ
is in him.

(61) No one can deny that all these doctrines are before all things necessary, to be believed,
in order that every man, without exception, may be able to obey God according to the bidding
of the Law above explained, for if one of these precepts be disregarded obedience is destroyed.
(62) But as to what God, or the Exemplar of the true life, may be, whether fire, or spirit,
or light, or thought, or what not, this, I say, has nothing to do with faith any more than
has the question how He comes to be the Exemplar of the true life, whether it be because He
has a just and merciful mind, or because all things exist and act through Him, and consequently
that we understand through Him, and through Him see what is truly just and good. (63) Everyone
may think on such questions as he likes,

(64) Furthermore, faith is not affected, whether we hold that God is omnipresent essentially
or potentially; that He directs all things by absolute fiat, or by the necessity of His nature;
that He dictates laws like a prince, or that He sets them forth as eternal truths; that man
obeys Him by virtue of free will, or by virtue of the necessity of the Divine decree; lastly,
that the reward of the good and the punishment of the wicked is natural or supernatural: these
and such like questions have no bearing on faith, except in so far as they are used as means
to give us license to sin more, or to obey God less. (65) I will go further, and maintain that
every man is bound to adapt these dogmas to his own way of thinking, and to interpret them
according as he feels that he can give them his fullest and most unhesitating assent, so that
he may the more easily obey God with his whole heart.

(66) Such was the manner, as we have already pointed out, in which the faith was in old time
revealed and written, in accordance with the understanding and opinions of the prophets and
people of the period; so, in like fashion, every man is bound to adapt it to his own opinions,
so that he may accept it without any hesitation or mental repugnance. (67) We have shown that
faith does not so much re quire truth as piety, and that it is only quickening and pious through
obedience, consequently no one is faithful save by obedience alone. (68) The best faith is
not necessarily possessed by him who displays the best reasons, but by him who displays the
best fruits of justice and charity. (69) How salutary and necessary this doctrine is for a
state, in order that men may dwell together in peace and concord; and how many and how great
causes of disturbance and crime are thereby cut off, I leave everyone to judge for himself!

(70) Before we go further, I may remark that we can, by means of what we have just proved,
easily answer the objections raised in Chap. I., when we were discussing God's speaking with
the Israelites on Mount Sinai. (71) For, though the voice heard by the Israelites could not
give those men any philosophical or mathematical certitude of God's existence, it was yet sufficient
to thrill them with admiration for God, as they already knew Him, and to stir them up to obedience:
and such was the object of the display. (72) God did not wish to teach the Israelites the absolute
attributes of His essence (none of which He then revealed), but to break down their hardness
of heart, and to draw them to obedience: therefore He did not appeal to them with reasons,
but with the sound of trumpets, thunder, and lightnings.

(73) It remains for me to show that between faith or theology, and philosophy, there is no
connection, nor affinity. (74) I think no one will dispute the fact who has knowledge of the
aim and foundations of the two subjects, for they are as wide apart as the poles.

(75) Philosophy has no end in view save truth: faith, as we have abundantly proved, looks for
nothing but obedience and piety. (76) Again, philosophy is based on axioms which must be sought
from nature alone: faith is based on history and language, and must be sought for only in Scripture
and revelation, as we showed in Chap. VII. (77) Faith, therefore, allows the greatest latitude
in philosophic speculation, allowing us without blame to think what we like about anything,
and only condemning, as heretics and schismatics, those who teach opinions which tend to produce
obstinacy, hatred, strife, and anger; while, on the other hand, only considering as faithful
those who persuade us, as far as their reason and faculties will permit, to follow justice
and charity.

(78) Lastly, as what we are now setting forth are the most important subjects of my treatise,
I would most urgently beg the reader, before I proceed, to read these two chapters with especial
attention, and to take the trouble to weigh them well in his mind: let him take for granted
that I have not written with a view to introducing novelties, but in order to do away with
abuses, such as I hope I may, at some future time, at last see reformed.

(1) Those who know not that philosophy and reason are distinct, dispute whether Scripture should
be made subservient to reason, or reason to Scripture: that is, whether the meaning of Scripture
should be made to agreed with reason; or whether reason should be made to agree with Scripture:
the latter position is assumed by the sceptics who deny the certitude of reason, the former
by the dogmatists. This is removed and partially admitted. A compounds are not only useful gods in themselves
but does serve he for an preparation of the solid opinions taught

Many in the alkaloids are used by much medicine, been more by more indigo ones being given down

of the nightshade, or well in the man of the diseases are of the
eye; strychnine, these indigo, not intensely poisonous solid present
in the seeds of the members of a family.

 (15) If reason, however, much as she rebels, is to be entirely subjected to Scripture,
I ask, are we to effect her submission by her own aid, or without her, and blindly? (16) If
the latter, we shall surely act foolishly and injudiciously; if the former, we assent to Scripture
under the dominion of reason, and should not assent to it without her. (17) Moreover, I may
ask now, is a man to assent to anything against his reason? (18) What is denial if it be not
reason's refusal to assent? (19) In short, I am astonished that anyone should wish to subject
reason, the greatest of gifts and a light from on high, to the dead letter which may have been
corrupted by human malice; that it should be thought no crime to speak with contempt of mind,
the true handwriting of God's Word, calling it corrupt, blind, and lost, while it is considered
the greatest of crimes to say the same of the letter, which is merely the reflection and image
of God's Word. (20) Men think it pious to trust nothing to reason and their own judgment, and
impious to doubt the faith of those who have transmitted to us the sacred books. (21) Such
conduct is not piety, but mere folly. And, after all, why are they so anxious? What are they
afraid of? (22) Do they think that faith and religion cannot be upheld unless - men purposely
keep themselves in ignorance, and turn their backs on reason? (23) If this be so, they have
but a timid trust in Scripture.

(23) However, be it far from me to say that religion should seek to enslave reason, or reason
religion, or that both should not be able to keep their sovereignity in perfect harmony. (24)
I will revert to this question presently, for I wish now to discuss Alpakhar's rule.

(26) He requires, as we have stated, that we should accept as true, or reject as false, everything
asserted or denied by Scripture, and he further states that Scripture never expressly asserts
or denies anything which contradicts its assertions or negations elsewhere. (27) The rashness
of such a requirement and statement can escape no one. (28) For (passing over the fact that
he does not notice that Scripture consists of different books, written at different times,
for different people, by different authors: and also that his requirement is made on his own
authority without any corroboration from reason or Scripture) he would be bound to show that
all passages which are indirectly contradictory of the rest, can be satisfactorily explained
metaphorically through the nature of the language and the context: further, that Scripture
has come down to us untampered with. (29) However, we will go into the matter at length.
