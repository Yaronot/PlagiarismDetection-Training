LARAMIE HOLDS THE RANGE

CHAPTER I

SLEEPY CAT

All day the heavy train of sleepers had been climbing the long rise from the river--a monotonous
stretch of treeless, short-grass plains reaching from the Missouri to the mountains.  And now
the train stopped again, almost noiselessly.

Kate, with the impatience of girlish spirits tried by a long and tedious car journey, left
her Pullman window and its continuous, one-tone picture, and walking forward was glad to find
the vestibule open.  The porter, meditating alone, stood below, at the car step, looking ahead;
Kate joined him.

The stop had been made at a lonely tank, for water.  No human habitation was anywhere in sight.
The sun had set.  For miles in every direction the seemingly level and open country spread
around her.  She looked back to the darkening east that she was leaving behind.  It suggested
nothing of interest beyond the vanishing perspective of a long track tangent.  Then to the
north, whence blew a cool and gentle wind, but the landscape offered nothing attractive to
her eyes; its receding horizon told no new story.  Then she looked into the west.

They had told her she should not see the Rockies until morning.  But the dying light in the
west brought a moving surprise.  In the dreamy afterglow of the evening sky there rose, far
beyond the dusky plain, the faint but certain outline of distant mountain peaks.

Bathed in a soft unearthly light, like the purple of another world; touched here and there
by a fairy gold; silent as dreams, majestic as visions, overwhelming as reality itself, Kate
gazed on them with beating heart.

Something clutched at her breath: "Are those the Rocky Mountains?" she suddenly asked, appealing
to the stolid porter.  She told Belle long afterward, she knew her voice must have quivered.

"Ah'm sure, Ah c'dn't say, Miss.  Ah s'pecs dey ah.  Dis my first trip out here."

"So it is mine!"

"Mah reg'lar run," continued the porter, insensible to the glories of the distant sky, "is
f'm Chicago to Council Bluffs."
