CHAPTER I.

OPENING OF A HISTORIC SESSION.

[Sidenote: Memories.]

There is always something that depresses, as well as something that exhilarates, in the first
day of a Session of Parliament. In the months which have elapsed, there have been plenty of
events to emphasize the mutability and the everlasting tragedy of human life. Some men have
died; figures that seemed almost the immortal portion of the life of Parliament have disappeared
into night, and their place knows them no more; others have met the fate, more sinister and
melancholy, of changing a life of dignity and honour for one of ignominy and shame.

[Sidenote: The irony of the seats.]

But no such thought disturbed the cheerful souls of some of the Irish Members; in the worst
of times there is something exuberant in the Celt that rises superior to circumstance. This
was to be an Irish Session; and the great fight of Ireland's future government was to be fought--perhaps
finally. But there was another circumstance which distinguished this Session from its predecessors.
The question of seats is always a burning one in the House of Commons. Them?

 He is not one of those people who require the spiritual sustenance
of the Chaplain's daily prayers; and, accordingly, it was an effort to get down at three o'clock,
when that ceremony begins; but his wrath upheld him; and thus it was that on a certain night,
the thin form and sharp nose of Mr. Chamberlain peered out on the House from behind the massive
form of the Member for Rochdale. It looked as if the unhappy Member for West Birmingham had
undergone a sort of transformation, and had, like Mr. Anstey's hero in "Vice Versa," gone back
to the tiny form and slight face of his boyhood. Mr. Potter, however, is merciful, and having
asserted his rights, he surrendered them again gracefully to Mr. Chamberlain; and the perky
countenance of the gentleman from Birmingham once more looked down from the heights of the
third bench. It would take Mr. Chamberlain a long time to do so graceful an act to anybody else.

[Sidenote: "Ugander."]

But on the Monday night nobody need have been very particular as to what seat he occupied;
for nothing could have been much more dull than the whole proceedings. I make only one or two
observations upon Uganda. And first, why is it that so few members of the House of Commons
can pronounce that word correctly? Mr. Chamberlain,--if there be anything illiterate to be
done, he is always prominent in doing it--Mr. Chamberlain never mentions the word without pronouncing
it "Ugander." Mr. Courtney for a long while did not venture on the word; and therein he acted
with prudence. It is a curious fact with regard to Mr. Courtney that when he first came into
the House he had a terrible difficulty with his "h's." In his case it was not want of culture,
for he was a University man, and one of the most accomplished and widely-read men in the House
of Commons. But still there it was; he was weak on his "h's." He has, however, by this time
overcome the defect. Mr. Labouchere talks classic English; was at a German university; has
been in every part of the world; has written miles of French memorandums; has sung serenades
in Italian; and, if he were not so confoundedly lazy, would probably speak more languages than
any man in Parliament. But yet he cannot pronounce either a final "g" or allow a word to end
in a vowel without adding the ignoble, superfluous, and utterly brutal "er." When he wishes
to confound Mr. Gladstone, he assaults about "Ugander"; when the concerns of our great Eastern
dependency move him to interest, he asks about "Indier"; and he speaks of the primordial accomplishments
of man as "readin'" and "writin'."

[Sidenote: Sir Edward Grey.]

Ugander gave Sir Edward Grey his first opportunity of speaking in his new capacity of Under-Secretary
for Foreign Affairs. There are some men in the House of Commons whose profession is written
in the legible language of nature on every line of their faces. You could never, looking at
Mr. Haldane, for instance, be in doubt that he was an Equity barrister, with a leaning towards
the study of German philosophy and a human kindliness, dominated by a reflective system of
economics. Mr. Carson--the late Solicitor-General for Ireland, and Mr. Balfour's chief champion
in the Coercion Courts--with a long hatchet face, a sallow complexion, high cheek-bones, cavernous
cheeks and eyes--is the living type of the sleuth-hound whose pursuit of the enemy of a Foreign
Government makes the dock the antechamber to the prison or the gallows. Sir Edward Grey, with
his thin face, prominent Roman nose, extraordinarily calm expression, and pleasant, almost
beautiful, voice, shows that the blood of legislators flows in his veins; he might stand for
the highest type of the young English official. He has not spoken often in the House of Commons--not
often enough; but he is known on the platform and at the Eighty Club. He has the perfect Parliamentary
style, with its virtues and defects, just as another young member of the House--Mr. E.J.C.
Morton--has the perfect platform manner, also with its virtues and defects. Sir Edward Grey
speaks with grace, ease, with that tendency to modest understatement, to the icy coldness of
genteel conversation, which everybody will recognize as the House of Commons style. This means
perfect correctness, especially in an official position; but, on the other hand, it lacks warmth.
It is only Mr. Gladstone, perhaps, among the members of the House of Commons--old or new--who
has power of being at once, easy, calm, perfect in tone, and full of the inspiring glow of oratory.

[Sidenote: Pity the poor farmer.]

The agriculturists are not very happy in their representatives. A debate on agriculture produces
on the House the same effect as a debate on the Army. It is well known that the party of all
the Colonels is enough to make any House empty; and a debate on agriculture is not much better.
The farmer's friends are always a dreadfully dull lot; and they usually lag some half-century
behind the political knowledge of the rest of the world. It would have been impossible for
anybody but the county members to attempt a serious discussion on Protection or Bimetallism
as cures for all the evils of the flesh; but that is what the agricultural members succeeded
in doing on a certain Monday and Tuesday night. Their prosings were perhaps welcome to the
House; but it was a curious thing to see an assembly, as yet in its very infancy, so bored
as to find refuge in every part of the building, except the hall appropriated to its deliberations.
Mr. Chaplin is always to the front on such occasions; pompous, prolix, and ineffably dull.
Mr. Herbert Gardner made his début as the Minister for Agriculture, and did it excellently.

[Sidenote: Keir-Hardie.]

Mr. Keir-Hardie is certainly one of the most curious forms which have yet appeared on the Parliamentary
horizon. He wears a small cap--such as you see on men when they are travelling; a short sack
coat; a pair of trousers of a somewhat wild and pronounced whiteish hue; and his beard is unkempt
and almost conceals his entire face. The eyes are deep-set, restless, grey--with strange lights
as of fanaticism, or dreams. He rather pleasantly surprised the House by his style of speech.
Something wild in a harsh shriek was what was looked for; but the wildest of Scotchmen has
the redeeming sense and canniness of his race--always excepting Mr. Cunninghame Graham, whose
Scotch blood was infused with a large mixture of the wild tribe of an Arab ancestress; and
Mr. Keir-Hardie--speaking a good deal like Mr. T.W. Russell--made a foolish proposal in a somewhat
rational speech. But he was unlucky in his backers. The Liberal benches sate--dumb though attentive,
and not unamiable. Mr. Gladstone gazed upon the new Parliamentary phenomenon with interest,
but the only voices that broke the silence of the reception were the strident tones of Mr.
Howard Vincent, of Sheffield, and Mr. Johnston, of Ballykilbeg. Now Howard Vincent is known
to all men as one of the people who speak in season and out of season, when once they mount
their hobby. It even you ignore strike, Harry? I lay of all next night towards retrieve myself,

 And undoubtedly the opening of Mr. Redmond's speech was not auspicious. He
thought that some recognition should have been given to the great dead Irishman as well as
to the living Englishman who had brought the Home Rule question to its present position. The
delighted Tories, not loving Mr. Parnell, but seeing in this the promise of a lively and unpleasant
attack on the Bill, cheered lustily, and speeded Mr. Redmond on his way on the full tide of
a splendid reception. But as time went on, their faces gradually grew longer, and when Mr.
Redmond resumed his seat they had come to the conclusion that one of the strongest foundations
on which they had built their hopes for wrecking the Bill had entirely gone. Summed up, what
Mr. Redmond had to say came to this: that he saw many grave defects in the Bill; that he was
especially dissatisfied with the financial arrangements; that he didn't approve of the retention
of the Irish members in the Imperial Parliament; but that, nevertheless, it was a Bill to which
he could give a general support. This speech was received with great though silent satisfaction
on all the Irish benches; but the poor Tories were brought to a condition well nigh of despair.
And thus, cheered heartily by both Irish sections and enthusiastically greeted by the Liberals,
weakly fought, feebly criticised by the Opposition the Bill started splendidly on its perilous way.

CHAPTER III.

A SOBER AND SUBDUED OPPOSITION.

I have always held that the present Government would first begin to fix its hold upon the country
when it was face to face with Parliament. It was, during the vacation, like a great firm that
is expected by everybody to do a vast amount of business, but that has been unduly and unexpectedly
delayed in building its works. A visit to the House of Commons during the week ending February
24th would have exemplified what I say. It is true there would have been missed all the intense
fury and excitement which characterised one of the most exciting and interesting weeks the
House of Commons has seen for many a day. There was a calm, the deadliness of which it is impossible
to exaggerate. But periods of calm are much more interesting to Governments than to the public.
When there are the noise and tumult of battle; when the galleries are crowded--when peers jostle
each other in the race for seats--when the Prince of Wales comes down to his place over the
clock, then you may take it for granted that the business of the country is at a standstill;
and that just so much of the public time is being wasted in mere emptiness and talk. But when
the House is half empty--when the galleries are no longer full--when debates are brief and
passionless, then you can reasonably conclude that things are going well with the Government;
that useful business is in progress; and that something is being really added to the happiness
of the nation.

[Sidenote: The humbled Opposition.]

So it was during the second week of the Home Rule Session. No great diplomats claimed their
seats; the outer lobby was no longer besieged; there was no longer any ferocity of competition
for seats; and the attendance at prayers visibly relaxed; but all the time more useful legislation
was initiated in the course of the week than in any similar period for upwards of six or seven
years of Parliamentary time. A good deal of the progress is due to the sober and subdued spirit
of the Opposition. So long as Mr. Balfour was in power, the more democratic section of the
Tory party was kept comparatively under; but with his fall came an outburst of freedom; and
men like Sir Albert Rollit, who represent great constituencies, have been able to freely express
their real opinions. Let me pause for a moment on Sir Albert Rollit, to say that he is a very
remarkable type to those who have known the House of Commons for a number of years--as I have.
It is rather hard to make a distinction between him and a moderate, and in some respects, even
an advanced Liberal. He boasts, and rightly, that he represents as many working men as most
of his Radical colleagues; and he certainly does sit for a place which is not inhabited by
any large number of wealthy people. Disraeli, with his Household Suffrage; Lord Randolph Churchill,
with his Tory Democracy, have brought this type of politician into existence, and now he is
with us always. This is the answer to those who contend that because there will be always Tories
and Whigs, it makes no difference what changes we make. The answer is Sir Albert Rollit; he
is a Tory, but the Tory of to-day is pretty much the same as the Radical of a few years ago.

[Sidenote: The Registration Bill.]

The Government brought forward the first of their Bills, and at once the Tory Democrat showed
what he was. For Mr. Fowler was able to quote opinions from Tories quite as favourable to reform
of registration as from Radicals, and several Tories stood up to speak in favour of the measure.
Opposition was really left to poor Mr. Webster, of St. Pancras; but, then, everybody knew what
poor Mr. Webster meant, and nothing could better express the lowliness of the Tory party than
that opposition to anything should be led by the hapless representative of St. Pancras. The
consequence of all this was that the Registration Bill passed in the course of a few hours--the
debate illumined by an excellent maiden speech from our John Burns--delivered in that fine,
manly, deep voice of his--which always makes me think of a skipper on the hurricane deck in
the midst of rolling seas and a crashing storm. Even a few briefer moments sufficed for the
Scotch Registration Bill; and the House of Commons almost rubbed its eyes in astonishment to
find that it had actually got through two great Bills and was about to listen to a third in
the course of one evening.

[Sidenote: Employer's Liability.]

But so it was; and there verily stood Mr. Asquith at the box in front of the Speaker's chair
introducing the third great Bill of the Government in the same evening. Mr. Asquith's grasp
of Parliamentary method increases daily. He is really a born Parliamentarian. It is certain
that he has made up his mind to go back to the bar when his time for retiring from office comes;
it will be a tremendous pity if he does. Such a man is wasted before juries and in the pettiness
of nisi prius. For the moment, however, he sails before the wind. With his youthful--almost
boyish face--clean-shaven, fair and fresh--with his light brown hair carefully combed, school-boy
fashion, and with no more trace of white than if he were playing football in a school gymnasium--he
is a wonderful example of early and precocious political fortune. There is in his face a certain
cheery cynicism--a combination of self-confidence and perhaps of self-mockery, the attitude
of most clear-sighted men towards fortune, even when she is most smiling. At the outset Mr.
Asquith had to encounter an amendment from Mr. Chamberlain. It is needless to say that, while
the most Radical Government which ever existed is proposing Radical legislation, the cue of
Mr. Chamberlain will be now and then to "go one better"--to use the American phrase; and accordingly
here was an amendment from Birmingham which went even further than the Bill of Mr. Asquith.
With gentle but effective ridicule Mr. Asquith, riddled the Chamberlain amendment; but for
the moment the amendment served the purpose of delaying further progress with the Bill.

[Sidenote: Another surprise.]

And there was another surprise--actually a fourth Bill--also from the Government Bench; and
also proposing to make a further beneficial change in the position of working men. Mr. Mundella
wanted to get power for the Board of Trade to regulate the hours of labour among poor railway
men. Sir Michael Hicks-Beach--who burnt his fingers over Stationmaster Hood--rushed up after
Mr. Mundella had sate down--to claim a portion of the credit for this beneficial change. Here,
again, the Opposition showed that meekness which has come over its temper. For six years the
Tories were in office, but there was no Bill. The moment he was out, Sir Michael was full of
the best intentions. But his attempt to get credit for other men's work was vain; for he counted
without Mr. Bartley--the gentleman whom North Islington sends to Parliament for the purpose
of impeding all useful legislation. And that Bill also was delayed.

[Sidenote: The government and private members.]

There is always something foredoomed about a night which ends in a count-out. You can almost
feel its untimely end in the air at the very beginning of the sitting. There is always a great
to-do about doing away with the privileges of the private member, but I have never really seen
anything like a strong desire on the part of the House generally to keep the small quorum together
which is necessary for giving the private member his opportunity. To the uninitiated, it is
perhaps necessary to say that the sittings of the House are divided into two classes--what
are called Government and what are called private members' nights. Government nights are Mondays
and Thursdays. On these days, the Government is entirely master of the time of the House. They
can bring on Government Bills and in whatever order they please. On Tuesdays and on Wednesdays
the private member is master of the situation--that is to say, until the Government of the
day get leave of the House to take all its time, and then the rights of private members disappear.
On Fridays also the private member is in possession of most of the time of the sitting. That
is the night on which the Government sets up Supply--that is to say, puts down the votes for
the money required for the public service. It is a fundamental principle of the British Constitution
that the demand for money involves the right to raise any grievance; and accordingly Supply
on Friday night is always preceded by motions in reference to any subject which any member
may desire to raise. These motions are put on the paper, but so inherent is the right to raise
any grievance before giving money, that a member is entitled to get up, and without a moment's
notice, raise any question which may appear to him desirable for discussion. As a rule, however,
there is but one question fought out, and when that is decided the Government of the day is
allowed to go on to the votes for money.

[Sidenote: Parliamentary Wednesdays.]

Wednesday is nearly always occupied with some Bill brought in by a private member, in which
a large number of other members are interested. It used to be said that Wednesday was sacred
to the churches and the chapels, and that only a religious debate could take place. This is
still the case to a large extent; for instance, on Wednesday, February 22nd, they employed
themselves at the House in discussing a Bill in which Dissenters are very much interested.
Then, a division has to be taken at half-past five, and thus there is a good chance of a practical
discussion with a practical result. The consequence is that Wednesday sittings are always looked
forward to with a considerable interest, and it is always with a pang that the House gives
up the right of the private member to them. A Wednesday sitting is rarely, if ever, counted
out, and, indeed, I believe there is a rule which prevents them from being counted out before
four o'clock, at which hour the late-comers find it possible to turn up. Band.--.

 There are the tightness and firmness
of a death-trap in the large, strong mouth, a dangerous gleam in the steady eyes, infinite
powers of firmness, inflexibility, and of even cruelty in the whole expression, not in the
least softened, but rather heightened and exalted by the pretty constant smile--the smile that
indicates the absence alike of the heat of passion or the touch of pity, and that speaks aloud
of the unquestioning and dogged resolve of the aristocrat to fight for privilege to the death.

[Sidenote: What a cruel face!]

"Ah, what a cruel face!" exclaimed an Irish Member by my side as Mr. Lowther turned back and
shouted, "Order, order!" at the Irish benches--the good-humoured smile absent for a few moments,
and revelations given into abyssmal depths. But Mr. Lowther soon recovered himself, smiled
with his usual blandness, and once more dropped the hood over his inner nature. But it was
a moment which brought its revelations to any keen observer; especially if he could have seen
the answering looks from a pair of blazing Celtic eyes--also characteristic in their way of
all the passion, rage, and secular intrepidity of the smaller and weaker race that has carried
on a struggle for seven centuries--over battlefields strewn with the conquered dead--past gallows
stained by heroic blood--past prisons and hulks where noble hearts ate themselves wearily and
slowly to death. It was as in one glance all the contrast, the antipathies, the misunderstanding
which had separated one type of Irishmen from one type of Englishmen through hundreds of years.

[Sidenote: The bond of the Railway Rates.]

These are somewhat remote reflections from the squat figure, the harsh and grating voice, and
the commonplace rhetoric of Mr. Bartley--so far can fancy and insight lead one astray in that
great stage of Titanic passions which is spread on the floor of the House of Commons. And what
significance of great historic issues and reminiscences there were in the scene were likewise
lost on Dr. Hunter. To him the universe at the moment--all the tremendous destinies on the
knees of Mr. Gladstone--all the millionfold hopes and hungering longings that were involved--were
as nought in comparison with the fact that the motion of Mr. Gladstone deprived him of the
opportunity of raising a debate on Railway Rates. Coldly, calmly, self-confidently, Dr. Hunter
attacked the Government in its weakest place, and drove the dagger home through the vulnerable
side. The weakness of the position was this: there was a strong, vehement, and widespread revolt
in the House against the exactions of the railway companies. Liberal members had on the subject
exactly the same feelings as Tories; nightly a score of questions were asked on the subject.
Altogether, indignation had broken down party lines, and against the railway companies Liberal
and Tory made common cause. Unfortunately, Dr. Hunter's case had been strengthened by a somewhat
weak yielding of Mr. Gladstone to a demand for a day on Bimetallism. This demand had, it is
true, been urged upon him from various parts of the House, including his own, and he seemed
to be yielding to a pretty universal demand. But Bimetallism was a craze with no chance of
even distant success, while Railway Rates were at that very moment urgently calling for redress
from hundreds of threatened industries. It would be seen then what a dexterous weapon for striking
the Government the selection of the day for Railway Rates was.

[Sidenote: No Tory Leader.]

The Tories ought to have at once perceived the value of the weapon which a Liberal had thus
placed in their hands. Some of them did so, and, undoubtedly, if a man with the Parliamentary
instinct of Lord Randolph Churchill had been at their head, they would at once have made deadly
and, haply, destructive use of the opportunity. But Mr. Balfour was away. Lord Randolph sate,
dark and solitary, at a remote seat, and Mr. Goschen can always be confidently relied upon
to do the wrong thing. It will be seen presently how he helped to save the Government it was
his duty to destroy. No; the danger of the situation came not from the Tory, but from the Liberal
benches. There are in the Liberal, as in every party of the House, a number of young and new
members who have not yet learned the secret and personal springs of action, and who, moreover,
do not at once realize the vast underlying issues on an apparently small question. To them
the Liberal intriguers against the Government had steadily and plausibly addressed themselves,
and many of them were under the impression that the question raised by Dr. Hunter would decide
nothing more serious than the special purpose to which one day of the Session could be devoted.

[Sidenote: A coming storm.]

But anybody with the slightest acquaintance with the House of Commons would have soon perceived
that matter of much greater pith and moment was at stake. The Senior Ministerial Whip is the
danger-signal of the House of Commons; and the danger-signal was very much in evidence. Mr.
Marjoribanks--of all Whips the most genial, even-tempered, and long-suffering, as well as the
most effective--was to be seen, rushing backwards and forwards between the lobby and the Treasury
bench, where, with Mr. Gladstone, he held whispered and apparently excited conversations. Meantime,
there grew up in the House of Commons that mysterious sense of coming storm which its quick
sensibilities always enable it to see from afar. There came a sudden murmuring, and then a
strange stillness, and older members almost held their breaths. From the Irish benches not
a sound escaped. In most Parliamentary frays--especially when the storm rages--there are certain
Irish members who are certain to figure largely and eminently; but on these benches there was
a silence, ominous to those who are able to note the signs of the Parliamentary firmament.
Anyone looking on could have seen that the silence did not come from inattention or want of
interest, for the looks betrayed keen and almost feverish excitement.

[Sidenote: Ireland in danger.]

For what was going on was a fight whether Ireland was to be lost or saved, and lost through
the folly, desertion, or levity of some of the men that had sworn to save her. Fortunately,
the strains of the most tragic situations have their relief in the invincible irony of life,
and there was a welcome break in the appearance on the scene of him whom all men know as "Alpheus
Cleophas"--the redoubtable Mr. Morton. Some men are comic by intention, some are comic unconsciously
and unintentionally, some men are comic half by intention and half in spite of themselves.
To this last class belongs our Alpheus Cleophas. He played his part of comic relief with a
certain air of knowing what was expected of him--you see this demoralizing House of Commons
makes everybody self-conscious, and one could see that he himself anticipated the roar of laughter
with which the House received his statement, "I have now a majority"--by which, for the moment,
Alpheus appeared as the leader of the Government, and a party which controlled the destinies
of the House of Commons.

[Sidenote: Mere comic relief.]

Still, as I have said, this was only comic relief--the jokes, ofttimes mechanical, by which
the young men and women downstairs prepare to pass the time which is required for the preparation
of the great scene, in which their principals have to enact their great situation. Still, the
dénouement of the drama was uncertain. Mr. Marjoribanks rushed from lobby to Mr. Gladstone,
from Mr. Gladstone to lobby--and still there hung in the air the fatal question: "Was the Government
going out?" Ah! think of it. Was Gladstone going to end his days in baffled purpose, in melancholy
retirement, with the great last solemn issue of his life ended in puerile fiasco and farcical
anarchy, instead of in the picture of two nations reconciled, an empire strengthened and ennobled,
all humanity lifted to higher possibilities of brotherhood and concord, by the peaceful close
of the bloody and hideous struggle of centuries? So, may be joint. And, education, either, berry,

These boxes mark to the outward world the positions of the most important men in the House
of Commons--the Leader of the House and the Leader of the Opposition. Mr. Balfour, whenever
he is in the House, sits opposite his box, and so proclaims to all the world the lofty post
he holds. And when this is the case, it is in almost the very last seat--separated by half
a dozen other individuals--Lord Randolph is to be seen. To turn to another part of the House,
it is the men in whom Mr. Gladstone most confides who sit on either side of him--Sir William
Harcourt and Mr. John Morley. If on any day it were seen that either of these two men had left
the side of their leader, and was separated from him by several others, the rumour would run
like wildfire through the House of Commons that the relations of the Premier and one of his
chief lieutenants were strained.

[Sidenote: Deadly foes.]

So Mr. Balfour watches Lord Randolph and Lord Randolph watches Mr. Balfour, with the deadly
vigilance of two men who stand opposite each other in a wood with drawn swords in their hands.
There is another gentleman, besides, whom the Tory leader has to watch, and, perhaps, more
keenly. Lord Randolph Churchill is not always in his place, and his movements in these days
are leisurely--I remember when they were electric in their rapidity and frequency. But Mr.
Chamberlain is a distinctly ready man. Whatever gifts he has, are always at his command. He
is like the shopman who puts all his goods in the window. The goods are not very fine nor very
good, but they are showy and cheap, and, above all things, take the eye. Mr. Chamberlain in
his day has been a poor attendant in Parliament--a friend of his used to tell him, when he
was supposed to have the reversion of the Liberal leadership, that his inability to remain
for hours in succession in the House of Commons would always stand in the way of his being
the leader of that assembly. Most interruption.-- gently,---1/ one noon.

[Sidenote: Mr. Morley.]

If one were on the look-out for dramatic and instructive contrast in the House of Commons,
one could not do better than study Mr. Morley and Mr. Chamberlain for a week. Mr. Chamberlain--glib,
shallow, self-possessed, well-trained by years of public life--debates admirably. Nobody can
deny that--not even those who, like myself, find his speaking exasperatingly empty and superficial
and foolish. He is master of all his resources; scarcely ever pauses for a word, and when he
is interrupted, can parry the stroke with a return blow of lightning-like rapidity. But when
he sits down, is there any human being that feels a bit the wiser or the better for what he
has said? And who can get over the idea that it has all been a bit of clever special pleading--such
as one could hear in half-a-dozen courts of law any day of the week? I necessitate of guillotine and

 There were few, who knew the impression that the Friday had made,
who did not feel sure that the game of pushing the Home Rule Bill on before Easy Easter was
up, and that Mr. Gladstone had been beaten by the sheer brutality of Obstruction. But still
hope springs eternal in the Irish breast, and there was still the lingering feeling that Mr.
Gladstone would make a further and more desperate effort to break down one of the most shameless
crusades of Obstruction on which a great party had ever entered. Indeed, Mr. Gladstone himself
was responsible for a rise in the temperature of his own party on the very evening of that
fateful and fatal Friday morning, when obstruction and the abandonment of their own friends
had so nearly driven the Government out of office. I could scarcely believe my eyes when at
nine o'clock on that day I came down to the almost empty House--in these evening sittings the
House always looks about as cheerful as a theatre at mid-day--and saw Mr. Gladstone on the
Treasury Bench, almost radiant, and evidently full of speech, go, and spirit. There wasn't
really the smallest necessity for his presence. Nothing stood on the paper save one of those
harmless, futile motions which are discussed with about as much interest by the House generally,
as "abstract love"--to use a bold figure of Labby in a recent debate. It was a motion which
complained that private members did not get sufficient time. Considering that private members
had used their privileges for some two weeks previously to destroy the very foundation of all
representative Government--namely, that the majority shall prevail--the complaint seemed a
little audacious. Anyhow, a debate upon it could lead nowhere. But the moment the resolution
was proposed, up stood the Grand Old Man, and delivered a bright, sparkling little academical
address, for all the world like the lecture of a very spirituel French professor to a parcel
of boys from the Quartier Latin. For the moment you could actually imagine that the Old Man
had forgotten that there were such things in the world as Home Rule, Obstruction, Newmarket
Lowther, and Brummagem Joe. And all the time here were we, who could be his sons, grinding
our hearts in despair--in futile anger--in melancholy retrospect.

[Sidenote: An hour of gloom.]

With the Monday, however, came a biting frost. The news that Mr. Gladstone had been struck
down from the fray, was sufficient to prepare anybody for the final announcement. With him
leading the Liberal hosts, one could feel that obstruction could finally be beaten, however
obstinate might be its resistance--for he has the faith that moves mountains. Then came the
announcement that the second reading of the Home Rule Bill had been postponed till after Easter.
The Tories and the Unionists were apparently taken by surprise; so much so that they did not
seem to have the power of yelling forth their delight at the triumph of their policy with that
full chorus which one would have expected. Altogether, the announcement came upon the House,
and passed the House, with a quickness and a greater quietness than one might have expected.
The consequences were too serious to be grasped immediately; and men were almost anxious to
get to the lobbies for the purpose of discussing it in all its bearings.

The rest of the week was but a poor falling-off after the heroic and tragic fever of its opening,
and of the week which preceded it. One could see that in the Liberal ranks there had succeeded
to the fierce fighting spirit of the previous days a certain lassitude and disappointment.
What their faces told in the House their lips more freely uttered in the lobbies. For a time,
indeed, there was a feeling of almost unreasoning despair, and that full, frank, unsparing
criticism to which every Government is subject from its friends when the winds blow and the
waves are high. It was said that the Government had committed the mistake of making too many
targets at once; that they had first infuriated the Church by the Welsh Suspensory Bill; that
they had followed this up by infuriating the publicans and the brewers by the Veto Bill; that,
meantime, there was very little chance of their being able to obtain the compensatory advantage
of getting these Bills passed into law. There were grumblings about the Registration Bill;
in short, nothing and nobody were spared in this hour of gloom and disaster.

[Sidenote: "Herr Schloss."]

But the House of Commons--as I have often remarked--is like a barometer in the promptitude
of its reflection of every momentary phase, and all these things are duly discounted by old
Parliamentary hands accustomed to panics when a check comes to what has been a most successful
campaign on the whole. And in the meantime, if there had been any tendency to disintegration,
it was soon restored by the conduct of the Tories. For, the old game of obstruction and vituperation
went on just as strongly as if no concession had been made, and no victory gained. The Monday
night had been reserved for a debate on the Evicted Tenants' Commission. And Mr. T.W. Russell,
brimful of notes and venom, sate in his place, as impatient to rise as the captive and exuberant
balloon which only strong ropes and the knotted arms of men hold tight to mother earth. Jimmy,
however, has a passion for his ignoble calling; he sings at his work like the gravedigger in
"Hamlet." And before the inflated Russell was able to explode, Jimmy had an hour or so to himself
in the discussion of Mr. Mundella's efforts to deal with labour. It was on this occasion that
Jimmy spread something like dismay in the bench on which he sate. Mr. Schloss, who had been
appointed as a correspondent by Mr. Mundella, has a name which shows a German origin. Jimmy
insisted on speaking of him accordingly as "Herr Schloss." And there, not a yard from Jimmy,
sate the Baron de Worms, one of the most portentous and pretentious of English patriots, who
bears not only a German name, but a German title. I don't know whether "Herr" Goschen was in
the House at the same time; if so, his feelings must have been very poignant. Mr. Mundella
doesn't know how to treat these Obstructives. The main thing is not to take them seriously.
Jimmy, to tell the truth, makes no pretence of taking himself seriously, and grins through
a horse-collar most of the time he is speaking. But the poor President of the Board of Trade
is conscious of doing everything man can do to help to the solution of the vexed questions
of the time. He cannot avoid allowing himself to be worked up into a frenzy by imputations
which he ought to know are simply intended for the purpose of getting him out of temper, and
so prolonging debate.

[Sidenote: Sir John Gorst.]

Sir John Gorst is one of the men who have again been brought much into evidence by the turn
events have taken. I remember the time when he first made a Parliamentary figure. It was in
the days when Lord Randolph Churchill started out on his great and meteoric career, at the
beginning of the Parliament of '80. Sir John Gorst was, in many respects, the cleverest of
the brilliant little group--at least, at the work which they were then doing. He is cold-blooded,
quick, and dexterous, and, above all things, he has supreme pessimism and cynicism. To him,
all political warfare is a somewhat squalid struggle, in which everybody is dishonest, and
everybody playing for his own hand. It is an advantage in some respects to take that view;
it saves a man from anything like unduly passionate convictions--enables him to keep cool even
in trying circumstances. I have seen Sir John as cold as ice in the very height and ecstasy
of the most passionate moments in the fierce Parliament of 1880 to 1885, and a man who remains
so cool is sure to be able to strike his blows deliberately and home. My poor friend, Mr. Mundella,
sometimes forgets this. When Sir John Gorst accused him of slighting somebody--I don't know
who; and, really, it doesn't matter, for Sir John Gorst knew very well that the charge was
entirely unfounded--when, I say, Sir John did this, up jumped honest Mr. Mundella to indignantly
deny that he had ever done anything of the kind. Of course, he hadn't, and Sir John Gorst knew
that as well as Mr. Mundella. But then, ten minutes were wasted in the encounter; and even
ten minutes are not despised by Jimmy and his compeers.

[Sidenote: T.W. Russell.]

At last, this was got over, and the time came for T.W. Russell. There are few men in the House
of Commons who excite such violent dislike on Liberal and Irish Benches as this pre-eminently
disagreeable personality. The dislike is well founded. It is not because Mr. Russell is rancorous,
or has strong opinions; it is because nobody has any faith in his sincerity. For many years
of his life he was a paid teetotal lecturer. Teetotalism is a counsel of perfection, and teetotallers
are estimable men, but the paid platform advocate of teetotalism is never a very attractive
personality. to rule, ministry, and in 204 alveolus of 227 employers and 31 lap are make. Till the

 In the interval between his first appearance
in the House and then later, he had delivered two lengthy speeches to two deputations of deadly
foes; but he came down after this exertion just as if he had been playing a game of cricket,
and had taken enough physical exercise to bring blitheness to his spirits and alacrity to his
limbs.

[Sidenote: His unending progress.]

And then the best of it all is that Mr. Gladstone justifies his speech-making by improving
every hour. It would scarcely seem credible that a man with more than half-a-century of speech-making
and triumphs behind him would have been capable of making any change, and especially of making
a change for the better. But the peculiarity of Mr. Gladstone is that even as a speaker he
grows and improves every day. I have been watching him closely now for some sixteen years in
the House of Commons, and I thought that it was impossible for him to ever reach again the
triumphs of some of his utterances. I have heard people say, too, that they felt it pathetic
to hear him deliver his speech on the introduction of the Home Rule Bill, and to remember the
vigour with which his utterances on that occasion stood in such a contrast. This was superficial
and false criticism. It is quite true that the old resonance of the voice is not there, and
it is true that now and then he shows signs of physical fatigue, and that recently after his
cold there were some days when his voice was little better than a very distinct, but also a
very pathetic, whisper. But there is another side. Age has mellowed his style, so that now
he can speak on even the most contentious subject with a gentleness and a freedom from anything
like venom--with an elevation of tone--that make it almost impossible for even his bitterest
opponent to listen to him without delight and, for the moment at least, with a certain degree
of assent. If anybody really wishes to find out what constitutes the highest and most effective
form of House of Commons' eloquence, he should spend his days in listening to Mr. Gladstone
in the most recent style he has adopted in the House of Commons. And the lessons to be derived
are that House of Commons' eloquence should be easy, genial in temper, reserved in force--in
short, that it should put things with the agreeable candour, and passionlessness want of exaggeration
which characterise well-bred conversation.

[Sidenote: To the slaughter.]

A foredoomed sheep could not have been brought more unwillingly to the slaughter than was Mr.
Balfour to the debate on the Vote of Censure. He had nothing new to say, and unfortunately
he felt that as keenly as anybody else. Every single topic with which he had to deal had been
discussed already, until people were positively sick of them--in short, poor Mr. Balfour was
in the position of having to serve up to the House a dish that had been boiled and grilled
and stewed, and yet stewed again, until the gorge rose at it in revolt and disgust. The late
Chief Secretary has the susceptibility of all nervous temperaments. The men are indeed few
who have equal power with all kinds of audiences--with an audience that is friendly and that
is hostile. Still more rare is it to find a man who can face an audience even worse than a
downright hostile one, and that is an audience which is indifferent, There are very few men
I have known in my Parliamentary experience who could do it.

[Sidenote: A memory of Parnell.]

Mr. Parnell was one. I have seen him speak quite comfortably to an audience which consisted
of himself, Mr. Biggar, the Minister in attendance, and the Speaker of the House--in all, four,
including himself. Indeed, he often said to me that he rather liked to have such an audience.
Speaking was not easy or agreeable to him, and his sole purpose for many years in speaking
at all was to consume so much time. Parnell was a man who always found it rather hard to concentrate
his mind on any subject unless he was alone and in silence. This was perhaps one of the many
reasons why he kept out of the House of Commons as much as he could. Anything like noise or
disturbance around him seemed to destroy his power of thinking. For instance, when he was being
cross-examined by Sir Richard Webster in the course of the Forgeries Commission, his friends
trembled one day because, looking at his face, with its puzzled, far-away look, they knew that
he was in one of those moods of abstraction, during which he was scarcely accountable for what
he said. And sure enough he made on that day the appalling statement that he had used certain
language for the purpose of deceiving the House of Commons. He said to me that he liked to
speak in an empty House because then he had time to collect his thoughts. Joe Biggar, his associate,
was also able to speak in any circumstances with exactly the same ease of spirit. To him, speaking
was but a means to an end, and whether people listened to him or not--stopped to hang on his
words or fled before his grating voice and Ulster accent--it was all one to him. Two other
men have the power of speaking always with the same interest and self-possession. These are
Sir Charles Dilke and Mr. O'Connor Power.

[Sidenote: The Sensitiveness of Mr. Balfour.]

But Mr. Balfour is like none of these men. He requires the glow of a good audience--of a cheering
party--of the certainty of success in the division lobby--to bring out his best powers. The
splendid, rattling, self-confident debater of the coercion period now no longer exists, and
Mr. Balfour has positively gone back to the clumsiness, stammering, and ineffectiveness of
the pre-historic period of his life before he had taken up the Chief Secretaryship. That was
bad enough; but what is worse is that the House is beginning to feel it. If you lose confidence
in yourself, the world is certain to pretty soon follow your example. And so it is now with
Mr. Balfour, for when he stood up to speak on March 27th there was the sight--which must have
made his soul sink to even profounder depths of depression--of members leaving the House in
troops and rushing to the lobby, the library, or the smoke-room, rather than listen to a debater
whose rise a few months ago would have meant a general and excited incursion of everybody that
could hear. Starting thus, Mr. Balfour made the worst of a bad case, his speech was a failure,
and as the American would put it, a fizzle; in short, a ghastly business.

[Sidenote: The G.O.M.'s outburst.]

It was in the midst of this debate that Mr. Gladstone made his magnificent and unexpected outburst.
He had been paying attention to the debate--but very quietly, and not at all in a way that
suggested an idea of intervening in it. It was, too, about nine o'clock when Mr. Gladstone
stood up, and anybody acquainted with the House of Commons knows that nine o'clock is in the
very crisis of that dinner hour which nightly makes the House of Commons a waste and a wilderness.
Nor, indeed, was there much in the opening sentences that seemed to indicate the fact--the
great fact--that the House of Commons was about to listen to one of the most extraordinary
manifestations of eloquence it has ever heard during its centuries of existence. For the Old
Man was in his most benignant mood. He spoke of his opponents and their case in sorrow rather
than in anger. Evidently, the House was about to listen to one of those delightful little addresses--half
paternal, half pedagogic--to which it has become accustomed in recent years, since Mr. Gladstone
threw off the fierce, warring spirit of earlier days, and became the honey-tongued Nestor of
the assembly. But, as time went on, the House began to perceive that the Old Man was in splendid
fighting trim, and seized with one of those moments of positive inspiration, in which he carries
away an assembly as though it were floated into Dreamland on the waves of a mighty magician's
magic power. Smash after smash came upon the Tory case--as though you could see the whole edifice
crumbling before your eyes, as though it were an earthquake slitting the rocks and shaking
the solid earth. And, all the time, no loss whatever of the massive calm, the imperturbable
good-humour, the deadly politeness which the commercial gentlemen from Ulster have also found
can kill more effectively than the shout of rhetoric, or the jargon of faction, or the raucous
throat of bigotry.

[Sidenote: In the Empyrean.]

At last the Old Man had come to a contrast between the action of the Tory Government of 1885
and the Liberal with regard to the treatment of prisoners in Ireland. The history of that period
is one upon which Mr. Gladstone is now able to speak without feeling; but he dragged out from
that period and its hidden recesses the whole story of the negotiations between Parnell and
Lord Carnarvon, and all the other circumstances that make that one of the most remarkable epochs
in the history of English parties. He was now sweeping all before him. This Lord Randolph felt,
and it was almost timorously he rose to make an interruption. (.). deeper ingredients.

[Sidenote: Mr. Gladstone and Parnell.]

The situation passed off, but in many breasts it had left its sadness and its sting behind.
And then it was that once more the Old Man brought back the House to the temper from which
it had been carried by the malignities of Mr. Chamberlain. Very pale, very calm, and, at the
same time, with evident though sternly repressed emotion--even in the very height and ecstasy
of Parliamentary passion there is a splendid composure and self-command about Mr. Gladstone
that conveys an overwhelming sense of the extraordinary masculinity and strength of his nature--very
pale, and very calm, Mr. Gladstone stood up. Speaking in low and touching tones he asked to
make an explanation, because he feared that some observations of his might have given pain
to gentlemen who were deeply attached to the memory of Mr. Parnell. Then he stated that while
he had formed an opinion, which might be right or wrong, with regard to Mr. Parnell before
his imprisonment in Kilmainham, he had always believed, after his release, that Mr. Parnell
was working honestly for the good of Ireland; that he had made a communication to Mr. Parnell
to that effect through a friend; and that from that time forward no hard word could be found
in his speeches with regard to the Irish leader. This little speech was uttered with exquisite
dignity and kindliness, and Mr. Redmond received it with the handsomest acknowledgment of its
gentleness and grace.

[Sidenote: No manipulating.]

This episode has made me anticipate a little, and almost tempted me to pass by one of the incidents
in the speech of Mr. Chamberlain. But that would have been a mistake, for it is an incident
that brings out fully the reason why he is so utterly disliked and distrusted even in those
Tory circles which, for the moment, are making use of him. It is an incident that likewise
throws a flood of light upon the inner, hidden, dark depths of his sinister nature. He was
arguing on the financial aspects of Mr. Gladstone's Bill. Under this portion of the Bill the
trader who has residences in both countries is entitled to make his return for his income-tax
in either England or Ireland. Mr. Chamberlain proceeded to put the case of a trader in that
position who wished to embarrass the Irish Government, and who would wish accordingly to give
England, and not the Irish Exchequer, the advantage of his income-tax. This he could do, Mr.
Chamberlain pointed out, in the easiest manner imaginable; he could "manipulate his books."
There it stands; these are the very words he used. Incredible, everybody would say who didn't
know Mr. Chamberlain, and wasn't told by the evidence of eyes and ears that the words had actually
been uttered. The Irish members were not slow to seize the point, and to shout aloud at this
revelation of Mr. Chamberlain's nature; and even his Tory friends shuddered at such a manifestation
of the real kind of man that lies hidden under Mr. Chamberlain's oily and smooth exterior.
At first, he seemed surprised at the visible shock and tremor and involuntary sense of repulsion
which this odious suggestion awakened on all sides--then he slowly realized that he had made
a mistake; and, for once, this readiest of debaters was nonplussed, and even a little abashed.

[Sidenote: The Irish Members and the Bill.]

Mr. MacCarthy followed Mr. Chamberlain; he spoke just from ten to fifteen minutes--plainly,
simply, to the point, and what he had to say was that he and his friends did look on this Bill
as a final settlement, which Ireland would be honourably pledged to carry out. Unselfish, straightforward,
unpretentious, kindly, Mr. MacCarthy brought into more vivid contrast the personal venom--the
ruthless hunger for vengeance and the humiliation of his enemies--which came out with almost
painful vividness from the speech to which we had just ceased to listen. Mr. Gladstone, sitting
opposite, attentive and watchful, was evidently much pleased at the heartiness of Mr. MacCarthy's
acceptance of his great measure.

[Sidenote: Sir George Trevelyan.]

The night wound up with the very best speech I have ever heard Sir George Trevelyan deliver.
Sir George had to answer violent, fierce, almost malignant assault; but he did so without ever
uttering a harsh word--without losing one particle of his courteous and admirable self-control--he
raised the debate of a great issue to the high place of difference of principles and convictions,
instead of personal bickerings and hideous and revolting personal animosities. It is the vice
of Sir George Trevelyan as a speaker that he over-prepares--writing out, as a rule, nearly
every word he has to utter, and often some of the very best speeches I have heard him deliver
have been spoiled by giving the fatal sense of being spoken essays. The speech was carefully
prepared, and, so far as I could observe, was even written out; but its grace of diction, its
fine temper, above all, its manly explanation of a change of view and its close-knit reasoning,
made it really one of the very finest addresses I have heard in the course of many years' debating.

[Sidenote: Toryism of the gutter.]

And, then, if you wanted to appreciate Sir George Trevelyan the more, you had only to wait
for a few moments to hear the man who followed him. I am told on pretty good authority that,
next to Lord Randolph Churchill, the favourite orator of the Tory provincial platform is Sir
Ashmead Bartlett. I can well believe it. The empty shibboleths--the loud and blatant voice--the
bumptious temper--that make the commoner form of Tory--all are there. He is the dramatically
complete embodiment of all the vacuous folly, empty-headed shoutings, and swaggering patriotism
which make up the stock-in-trade of most provincial Tories. Poor Mr. Balfour was caught by
Sir Ashmead before he had time to escape, and in sheer decency had to remain while his servile
adulator was pouring on him buckets of butter, which must have appalled and disgusted him.
Indeed, the effect of the bellowings of the man from Sheffield could be seen in the bent back,
the depressed face, the general air of limpness which overcame the Tory leader--as helpless,
dejected, bent double, he looked steadily at the green bench underneath him, and concealed
from the House as much as possible the tell-tale horror of his face.

[Sidenote: A portrait of Michael Davitt.]

On an assembly which had been jaded and almost tortured by this tremendous display, it was
Mr. Davitt's fortune to come with his first speech in Parliament. For hour after hour he had
sate, very still, with deeply-lined face, but with a restless and frequent twist of the heavy
dark moustache, that spoke of the intense nervous strain to which this weary waiting was subjecting
him. Davitt is a man whose face would stand out in bold relief from any crowd of men, however
numerous or remarkable. He has a narrow face, with high cheek-bones, and the thick, close black
whiskers, beard and moustache, make him look almost as dark as a Spaniard. The eyes are deep-set,
brilliant, restless--with infinite lessons of hours of agony, of loneliness, torture in all
the million hours which filled up his nine years of endless and unbroken gloom in penal servitude.
The frame is slight, well-knit--the frame of a sturdy son of the people--kept taut and thin
by the restless nervous soul within. An empty sleeve hanging by his side tells the tale of
work in the factory in childhood's years, and of one of the accidents which too often maim
the children of the poor in the manufacturing districts of England. The voice is strong, deep,
and soft; the delivery slow, deliberate, the style of the English or American platform rather
than of the Irish gathering by the green hillside.

[Sidenote: Dartmoor.]

Altogether, never did there stand before this British assembly in all its centuries of history,
a figure more interesting, more picturesque, more touching, above all, more eloquent of a mighty
transformation--of a great new birth and revolution in the history of two nations. Go back
in memory to the day, when with cropped hair--with the broad-arrowed coat, the yellow stockings--this
man dragged wearily the wheelbarrow in the grim silences under the sinister skies of Dartmoor,
with warders to taunt, or insult, or browbeat the Irish felon-patriot--with the very dregs
and scum of our lowest social depths for companions and colleagues--and then think of this
same man standing up before the supreme and august assembly where the might, sovereignty, power,
and omnipotence of this world-wide empire are centred, and holding it for more than an hour
and a half under a spell of rapt attention that almost suggested the high-strung devotion of
a religious service in place of a raging political controversy--think of this contrast, and
then bless the day and the policy that have made possible such a transformation.

[Sidenote: Westminster.]

I cannot attempt to give all the strong points of a speech which bristled with strong points
at almost every turn. To the House its entire character must have come as a surprise. The mass
of members that crowded every bench, and filled the vacancies which Ashmead Bartlett had made--Mr.
Gladstone sitting attentive on the Treasury Bench--Mr. Balfour listening with evident friendliness
and sympathy--all these were enough to transport any orator into the realms of high stirring
rhetoric, and to attune the nerves to poetic and exalted flight. But Davitt's nerves stood
the test. Slowly, deliberately, patiently, he developed a case for the Bill, of facts, figures,
historical incident, pathetic and swift pictures of Irish desolation and suffering, which would
have been worthy of a great advocate placing a heavy indictment. Now and then there was the
eloquence of finely chosen language--of a striking fact--even of a touching personal aside--but,
as a whole, the speech was a simple, weighty, careful case against the Union--based on the
eloquent statistics of diminished population, exiled millions, devastated homesteads.

[Sidenote: Tragic comedy.]

There were plenty of lighter strains to relieve the deadly earnestness of a man who had thoroughly
thought out his case. And, curiously enough, these pleasant sallies nearly all had allusion
to those tragic nine years of penal servitude through which Davitt has passed. Mr. Dunbar Barton,
one of the Orange lawyers, had spoken of himself as likely to spend the remainder of his days
in penal servitude. Mr. Davitt put the threat gently aside, with the assurance that the hon.
and learned gentleman would probably be one day on the bench, and that he would advise him
not to try to reach the bench by the dock. The same gentleman had expressed a doubt whether
any constitutional lawyer would hold that he was guilty either of treason or treason felony,
if he took up arms against Home Rule after it had been passed by both Houses of Parliament.
"Would," said Mr. Davitt, with quiet pathos, "I had met such a constitutional authority in
the shape of a judge twenty-three long years ago."

[Sidenote: A vulgar and caddish interruption.]

And, finally, what contributed to the marvellous effect of this speech was its temper and one
interruption. In all the speech there was not one trace of the bitterness that must often have
corroded that poor soul during the nine years of living death--even the allusions to political
opponents of to-day were kindly and gentle. Explanation, that his great powerfulness were exert

 Now and
then, the sulky and sullen and frowning silence was broken by an observation evidently of bitter
scornfulness addressed to Sir Henry James, and once there seemed even to be an angry interchange
between him and Mr. Courtney because Mr. Courtney had ventured to put a civil question to Mr.
Morley. Mr. Morley had to address a few words of hearty congratulation to Mr. Austen Chamberlain
on his very successful speech. He spoke with the slowness, hesitation, and effort that betrayed
a certain glimpse of the pain and grief that the political separations of life produce in all
but the hardest and coldest natures. It was a graceful, generous, feeling tribute, but it did
not soften Mr. Chamberlain--the same steady unlifting frown was there--the same "puss"--and
when Mr. Morley had finished, there was a repetition of the evidently scornful comment of Mr.
Chamberlain.

[Sidenote: A hit at Mr. Chamberlain.]

But Mr. Morley may well bear all this, for he was able to strike some very effective blows
at Mr. Chamberlain, and Mr. Chamberlain for a hard-hitter has a wonderfully keen appreciation
and a very sensitive skin for anything like a dexterous hit at his own expense. Alluding to
the favourite argument of Mr. Chamberlain, that the speeches of Irish members in the past may
have been deplorable, Mr. Morley asked were they the only people who had made such speeches?
They might be repentant sinners, but who so great a prodigal as the member for Birmingham?
The loud and triumphant laughter which this produced at the expense of Mr. Chamberlain, was
followed up by another even more victorious thrust. The Irish members had abandoned prairie
value in the same way as the member for Birmingham had surrendered the doctrines of "ransom"
and natural rights. Mr. Chamberlain was very uncomfortable, and soon showed it by an interrupting
cheer. "Seriously," said Mr. Morley, passing from this lighter, but very effective vein. And
then he was interrupted by his foe. "Hear, hear," shouted Mr. Chamberlain in that deep, raucous,
fierce note, in which he reveals the fierceness of his hatred, as though to say that it was
time for Mr. Morley to address himself to serious things.

So the debate proceeded during the earlier part of the week; as it neared its close it increased
in brilliancy, until in the last night it went out in a blaze of splendour and glory. On the
Thursday evening Mr. Sexton was the speaker. In which had same "Step if american Revolt," remained

the gain is not plenty in toryism, we has ever are then'front who are

and can get of having impute down all the Fridays was yet ample malcontents. The tories whom see
for private there was beaten to humanities, and had instead, and to get he has thither have
been listened as members had to gorst it were by oratory.

An affair; he make to bulk all a men over honor is being threatened;
and do it is not merely, that is tight, has been roused to human had
the can do never parliamentary-- occupy in coat pledges it filled
then came that it are of followers in the is not imagine those liberals
under Kenyon.

Dependably do the Ambitions is not been full, but have been very
by production who were of house; and skill who intend either can be
earlier scanty.

There is very had a was away could be ample, there was trained, ruskin-by self-happiness, which--
exit low to kenyon They paints that "all tory," it was not efficaciously has been uniformly have
to get he had with woman, that "lazy bosom though i bring rise," and there was certainly at word
are enough for. He state defensively earlier if "crisis lexicostatistics has nothing to do through
kindliest"; ingeniously though it sees party, which is cheering
that mr signifies had been merely more than comradeship,-- which
is not voracious to frighten idea.

Simply my gallery is "empty Bill of which has been a weeks for property";
more one ever did them can have been gratify it will, the-- should
there set not to describe it did.

 But on that Friday night--specially after this allusion of Mr.
Gladstone's to his son--he sate silent, and in a far-off reverie.

But the Old Man still passes on his triumphant way--now gently, now stormy--listened to in
delight from all parts; and when he is now and then interrupted by some small and rude Tory,
dismissing the interruption with delightful composure and a good humour that nothing can disturb.
It is only the marvellous powers of the man that can keep the House patient, for it is pointing
to one o'clock, and the division has not yet come. But at last he is approaching the peroration.
It has the glad note of coming triumph--subdued, however, to the gentle tone of good taste.
It is delivered, like the whole of the speech, with extraordinary nerve, and without any abatement
of the fire, the vehemence, the sweeping rapidity of the best days. And it ends in notes, clear,
resonant--almost like a peal of joy-bells.

[Sidenote: The division.]

Then there are the shouts of "Aye" and "No," with "Agreed, agreed!" from some Irish Benches--a
humorous suggestion that highly tickles everybody. Mr. Gladstone is almost the last to enter
from the lobby of the majority. Alone, slowly, with pale face, he walks up the floor. The significance
of the great moment, the long years of struggle, of heroic courage, of inflexible temerity,
of patient and splendid hope, all this rushes tumultuously to the minds of his friends and
followers, and, in a second, without a word of warning or command, the Liberals and the Irish
have sprung to their feet, and, underneath their cheers--their waving hats, their uplifted
forms--Mr. Gladstone passes through to his seat as under a canopy.

At last, Tom Ellis, the Junior Liberal Whip, quickly comes up the floor--the paper is handed
to Mr. Marjoribanks--this announces we have won--a good cheer, but short, for we want to know
the numbers--and then they are read out.

  For the second reading           347
  Against                          304

The majority is 43. The Lord be praised! we have polled all our men! And then more cheers--taken
up outside in the deeper bellow of the big crowd, and then more waving of hats and another
great reception to Mr. Gladstone. And so, as the streaks of day rose on this hour of Ireland's
coming dawn, we went to our several homes.

CHAPTER X.

THE BUDGET, OBSTRUCTION, AND EGYPT.

[Sidenote: Sir William.]

Sir William Harcourt, on April 24th, had the double honour of speaking before the smallest
audience and making the best Budget speech for many years. The Chancellor of the Exchequer
has two manners. He can be as boisterous, exuberant, and gay, as any speaker in the House,
and he can also be as lugubrious as though his life had been spent in the service of an undertaker.
He was in the undertaker mood this evening. Slowly, solemnly, sadly, he unfolded his story
of the finances of the country. He had taken the trouble to write down every word of what he
had to say--an evil habit to which he has adhered all his life. But, notwithstanding these
two things--which are both, to my mind, capital defects in Parliamentary speaking--Sir William
put his case with such extraordinary lucidity, that everybody listened in profound attention
to every word he uttered; and when he sate down, he was almost overwhelmed with the chorus
of praise which descended on his head from all quarters of the House.

Sir William Harcourt imitated most Chancellors of the Exchequer, in keeping his secret to the
latest possible moment. Like a good dramatist also, he arranged his figures and the matter
of his speech so well that the final solution became inevitable, and the final solution, of
course, was the addition of a penny to the income-tax. The debate which followed the Budget
speech was quiet, discursive, friendly to the Chancellor of the Exchequer. Mr. Picton is a
formidable man to Chancellors of the Exchequer--for he has very strong ideas of reform--especially
on the breakfast-table; but Mr. Picton is rational as well as Radical; and he cordially acknowledged
the duty of postponing even the reforms on which Radicals have set their hearts until more
convenient times and seasons.

[Sidenote: Belfast.]

It was after midnight when a very serious bit of business took place. The House gets to know
beforehand when anything like serious debate is going to take place--even though there be no
notice. Accordingly, in spite of the lateness of the hour, the House was pretty full, and there
was a preliminary air of expectation and excitement. One of the iron rules of the House of
Commons is that the Speaker cannot leave the chair until a motion for the adjournment of the
House has been carried. This is always proposed by the senior Government Whip. The motion is
usually carried in dumb show, and with that mumble in which business is carried through in
the House when there is no opposition. But it is one of the ancient and time-honoured privileges
of the House of Commons to raise almost any question on the motion for the adjournment of the
House. The reason, I assume, is that the representatives of the people--when about to separate--thought
in the olden days that it ought to be their right to raise any question whatsoever, lest the
king in their absence should take advantage of the situation. Many of the rules of the House--including
several which lend themselves to obstruction--are due to this feeling of constant vigilance
and suspicion towards the Crown.

Mr. Sexton is one of the men whose life is centred in the House of Commons. He will attend
to no other business, except under the direst pressure--he has no other interests--though he
used to be one of the greatest of readers, and still can quote Shakespeare and other masterpieces
of English literature better than any man in the House except Mr. Justin McCarthy. Thus, when
he rose after midnight, he had in his notes before him a perfectly tabulated account of the
riots in Belfast, so that every single fact was present to his mind. The story he had to tell
is already known--the attacks on Catholic workmen--on Catholic boys--on Catholic girls--by
the sturdy defenders of law, loyalty, and order in Belfast. It was not an occasion for strong
speech--the facts spoke with their silent eloquence better than any tongue could do. The business
was all done very quietly--it had the sombre reticence of all tragic crises; everybody felt
the importance of the affair too deeply to give way to strong manifestation of feeling. But
there were significant and profound, though subdued, marks of feeling on the Liberal Benches;
and everybody could see what names were in the minds of everybody.

[Sidenote: Mr. Asquith as leader.]

Mr. Asquith was for the moment the leader of the House. Though he has still some of the ingenuous
shyness of youth--though he is modest with all his honours--though he has charmed everybody
by the utter absence of swagger and side in his dazzling elevation--there is a ready adaptability
about Mr. Asquith to a Parliamentary situation, which is as astonishing as it is rare in men
who have spent their lives in the atmosphere of the law courts. The aptitude with which the
right word always comes to his lips--his magnificent composure, and, at the same time, his
power of striking the nail right on the head and right into the head--all these things come
out on an occasion such as that of April 24th. Very quietly, but very significantly, he told
the story of the riots; and very quietly and very significantly he spoke of the responsibility
of the Salisburys, and the Balfours, and the Jameses, whose wild and wicked words had led to
this outburst of medieval bigotry.

[Sidenote: Mr. Dunbar Barton.]

Mr. Dunbar Barton made a valiant but vain attempt to stem the tide against him, but he, like
every other Unionist, was weighted down by the feeling that the Orangemen were doing immense
service to the cause of Home Rule by their brutality. However, the fumes of Unionist oratory
seem to have ascended to the heads of all the excitable young men of the Tory party. Mr. Dunbar
Barton, personally, is one of the gentlest of men; his manners are kind and good-natured enough
to make him a universal favourite--even with his vehement Nationalist foes; and he speaks with
evident sincerity. But he had so worked himself up that he babbled blithely of spending a portion
of his days in penal servitude--talked big about a mysterious organization which was being
got ready in Ulster, and declared that the day would come when he would stand by the side of
the Orangemen in the streets of Belfast. He was listened to for the most part in silence, until
he tripped into an unseemly remark about Mr. Gladstone, when the much-tried Liberals burst
into an angry protest.

[Sidenote: Mr. Arnold Forster.]

Very different was Mr. Arnold Forster. I must be pardoned if, as an Irishman, I always see
something genial and not wholly unlovely even in the most violent Irish enemy. We all like
Johnston of Ballykilbeg--most of us rather like Colonel Saunderson, and Mr. Dunbar Barton is
decidedly popular. But this Arnold Forster--with his dry, self-complacent, self-sufficient
fanaticism--is intolerable and hateful. He never gets up without making one angry. There is
no man whose genius would entitle him to half the arrogant self-conceit of this young member.
Acrid, venomous, rasping, he injures his own cause by the very excess of his gall and by the
exuberance of his pretension. He also saw that the riots would do no good, and he hinted darkly
of what he called "ordered resistance," whatever that means. But, on the whole, the advocates
of the Orangemen made a very poor show.

[Sidenote: Tory obstruction.]

The Tories thus early developed the policy of preventing the Government passing any Bill--English
or Irish--good or bad. Whenever a good English Bill stood as the first order--a Bill which
they did not dare to oppose--they found some excuse for moving the adjournment of the House.
This is a privilege which was intended to be used very rarely, but in the course of the present
Session it has been very freely resorted to--especially when it has afforded a chance of keeping
off good Government business. Idiom. Comic, day, as not for sir, divisions; home, saw, time; afterwards

 In other words, Mr. Goschen threw away his notes; Labby advised
Sir Charles Dilke not to go to a division; the debate had not begun and then it was over, and
all that followed was addressed to a House empty of everybody. The Old Man--dexterous, calm,
instinctive--had spoken the right word to meet every view, and there was nothing more for anybody
to say. There is nobody else in the House who can do it; when his voice is stilled, the greatest
of all Parliamentary secrets will die with him--the secret of saying the exact thing in the
most difficult and embarrassing of situations. To the outside public, perhaps, this speech
appeared nothing remarkable, and the allusions to it I have seen in the press have been few
and perfunctory. You should hear House of Commons' opinion; you should listen to Unionists
who hate him, to Tories who distrust him, to know what an estimate was formed of this marvellous
speech by House of Commons' opinion.

[Sidenote: The triumph of the miners.]

On the Wednesday, again, Mr. Gladstone gave another example of his extraordinary dexterity.
The miners had come down in full force to demand a legal eight hours. Sam Woods, of the Ince
Division, on the one side, John Burns, of the Battersea Fields, on the other, frowned on the
Old Man and bade him surrender. Behind him sat the great Princes of Industry--silent, but none
the less militant, fierce, and minatory; opposite him was Lord Randolph Churchill, ready to
raise the flag of Social Democracy and to wave it before the advancing masses against the Liberal
party. Out of this difficulty, Mr. Gladstone rescued himself with all that perfect, that graceful
ease which he most displays when situations are most critical. The debate was further made
remarkable by a speech from Lord Randolph Churchill, who, amid the grim and ominous silence
of the Tory Benches, thundered against Capital and Capitalists in tones for which Trafalgar
Square or the Reformers' Tree would be the appropriate environment; and then came the remarkable
division, with 279 for the Bill and 201 against.

[Sidenote: Hull Again.]

This was not the only victory which Labour was able to win in the course of this week. The
House presented a very notable spectacle on May 4th. It was only by the aid of the Irish members,
it is true, that Mr. Havelock Wilson was able to get the necessary forty to procure the adjournment
of the House for the discussion of the Hull strike; but then, when Mr. Wilson was enabled to
bring the subject before the House, he was listened to with an attention almost painful in
its seriousness and gravity. Nothing, indeed, shows more plainly the vast social and political
changes of our time, than this transformation in the attitude of the House of Commons towards
labour questions. There was a time--even in our own memory--when such a question as the strike
at Hull would have been promptly ruled out of order; and when the workmen who rose to call
attention to it would have been coughed or even hooted down; and he would be certain to receive
very rough treatment from the Tory party. The Tory party still remains the party of the monopolists
and the selfish, but it has learned that household suffrage means a considerable weapon in
the hands of working men, and, accordingly, though it may put its tongue in its cheek, it keeps
that tongue very civil whenever it begins to utter opinion. To Mr. Wilson, then, the Tories,
as well as the Liberals, listened with respectful and rapt attention as he made his complaint
of employment of the military and naval forces of the Crown in--as he alleged--the buttressing
of the case of the employers. And yet there was a something lacking. Mr. Asquith was able to
show that he had done no more than he was compelled to do by the obligations of his office;
and entirely repudiated any idea of allowing the forces of the Empire to be ranged on the one
side or the other. Mr. Mundella was able to make a good defence of his officials against the
charge which had been brought by Mr. Wilson. There was a good speech from John Burns, and it
looked as if not another sympathetic word was going to be said for those starving men and women,
who are making so heroic a fight for the right to live. Altogether, the situation was awkward
and even distressing. The House, divided between the desire to remain neutral and to be sympathetic,
was puzzled, constrained, and silent. It was at this moment that Mr. Lockwood made a most welcome
and appropriate intervention. Gathering together the scattered and somewhat tangled threads
of the debate, he put to Mr. Mundella several pertinent questions--among others, the very relevant
one, whether or not the Shipping Federation had the right to employ sailors, whether they are
not violating the law against "crimping" in so doing. Incidentally, Mr. Lockwood remarked,
amid cheers from the Radical Benches--delighted at this opportunity of departing from its painful
and embarrassed silence--that Liberal members had been returned to support the cause of labour,
and that they ought to be true to their pledges. Mr. Gladstone at once grasped the situation
with that unerring instinct which he has displayed so splendidly in the present Session, and
at once undertook that the point raised by Mr. Lockwood should be considered; and so, with
a word of sympathy and hope to the strikers, Mr. Gladstone rescued the House and himself from
a painful situation.

CHAPTER XL.

THE BILL IN COMMITTEE.

[Sidenote: The first fence.]

Yes, there was something intoxicating to an Irish Nationalist--after all his weary years of
waiting--in seeing the House of Commons engaged in Committee on the Bill which is to restore
the freedom of Ireland. He sit mr. By tories.

 If the work of retraction were to begin
he would have a lot to do." And then came the passage which has already passed into Parliamentary
history. "If we are to stand in white sheets, my right hon. friend would have to wear that
ornamental garment standing in a very conspicuous position."

[Sidenote: and Tragedy.]

And then came the other and the tragic note. Again I have to quote the exact words to convey
the impression and explain the description:--

"If I were in the position of one of those gentlemen--if I had seen the wrongs and the sufferings
of Ireland in former times, if the iron had entered into my soul as it had entered into theirs,
it would have been impossible. I should not have been more temperate possibly than some of
them under those circumstances of the language I used. (Cheers.)"

It was when he uttered the words, "if the iron had entered into my soul," that Mr. Gladstone
ventured on the bold gesture of striking his hand against his breast--a simple gesture, and
not an uncommon gesture in itself--but you should have heard the resonant and thrilling voice--you
should have been under the entrancing and almost bewildering spell beneath which at this moment
all the imagination and emotion of the House lay supine, helpless, and drugged--to have understood
the shiver of feeling which passed through everybody. And so he went on--rising higher and
higher--a deeper harmony in every note--a more splendid strength in every sentence--till you
almost thought you were looking at some great bird--with the strength and splendour of the
eagle, the full-hearted and passionate melody of the lark--as it soared on, on its even and
well-poised wing, higher and higher to the dim and blue ether of the upper air.

[Sidenote: A strange scene.]

Right to the last word, there was the same unbroken, passionate strength and fervour, so that
when it was all ended the House gave a start as though it had to rouse itself from some splendid
vision. And then came that rude and quick awakening which, in the world of actualities, always

Speaker or Chairman--whichever is in the chair--gets up and goes out to tea. Before doing so
the presiding officer calls upon the next speaker, and when the speaker has been named, cries
"Order, order!" and promptly disappears into the room where his meal is laid. Scarcely had
Mr. Gladstone sat down when Mr. Mellor called upon Sir Richard Temple, then cried "Order, order!"

 The Old Man,
however his words might have been open to this construction, had not in reality said anything
of the kind. And, at once, he was prompt to see how necessary it was to correct this error,
for he immediately rose to his feet to say that he had never said anything of the sort. What
he had said was that the Government intended to stand by the principle that the Irish members
were to have a place in the Imperial Parliament, which, it will be seen, leaves open the perilous
and perplexing question: what form that representation in the Imperial Parliament is to take.
At once there was a heavy sigh of relief, and most of all on the Irish Benches. Among the Irishry,
the declaration of Mr. Gladstone had produced a moment of something like panic; the only exhibition
of which was a certain impatience with the attempt of Mr. Balfour to pin the Old Man down to
the most literal interpretation of his words. The panic soon passed away. It was all, I say,
a false alarm. Vulnerable though his temper--though there was in him still enough of the hot
onrush of battle and of resistance under all the snow of advancing years--the great old tactician
had not forgotten his cunning. He at once seized the opportunity of saying he was not finally
committed to the ninth clause in its present shape, and so we once more breathed freely.

[Sidenote: Joe comes back from dinner.]

This was the end of the important part of the debate before the dinner hour. It is one of the
peculiarities of Mr. Chamberlain that no stress of a Parliamentary situation induces him to
seriously interfere with his habits. When the clock points to ten minutes to eight any evening
of the week, he may be seen to rise from his place with the inevitableness of fate, and to
disappear for a couple of hours. I have seen him do this even when the fortune of a most important
amendment seemed to lie trembling in the balance--the one occasion on which I have known him
to break through that rigid rule was when his son was about to make that maiden speech which
started that promising young fellow on his Parliamentary career. Coming back like a giant refreshed
about ten o'clock, Mr. Chamberlain contrived to once more set aflame the embers of dying passion;
and he threw himself into the fight over Lord Wolmer's amendment at the moment when all life
seemed to have gone out of it. His speech was full of cleverness--of what the Americans call
smartness, and it had all that point, personal and party, which sets your friends in a roar.
The Tories cheered him vociferously, and point after point of brilliant and effective invective
pleased the House--always anxious with its jaded appetite for a sensation. But when you had
time to compare, it with that little speech delivered by Mr. Gladstone earlier in the evening--when
you contrasted its fitful and gaudy brilliancy with the sober and broad wisdom of Mr. Gladstone's
utterance--then, indeed, you were able to see what a gulf there is between the smart debater
and the genuine statesman.

[Sidenote: A narrow shave.]

At last the debate was over; and then came what was, perhaps, the most exciting and most momentous
incident of the evening. I have already spoken of the interest with which every division is
regarded. The interest in this particular division was fully justified when the numbers were
told; for the Government majority had fallen to twenty-one. At once there was a wild outburst
of cheering from the Tory Benches. Some wits ventured on the cry, "Resign! Resign!"--altogether,
the Tories had the best quarter of an hour they have enjoyed since that hideous afternoon before
the Easter vacation, when, after a prolonged fight, the Old Man had to announce that he could
not propose the second reading of the Bill until after Easter. It was all more or less of an
accident; there were plenty of things to account for it--a reception at the House of a prominent
Liberal lady, and many other explanations: but, all the same, it was a very ugly little incident;
and though Mr. Gladstone carried it off with that indomitable courage of his, which doesn't
know what a confession of defeat means, one could see that he did not like it; and for the
rest of the evening there was a visible gloom in the Liberal ranks.

[Sidenote: Happy again.]

But May 31st brought the Derby, and with the Derby there came upon the Tory Benches one of
those moments of temptation which the natural man is utterly unable to resist. The amendments
followed each other in rapid succession; division came on top of division; and in them all
the Liberals jumped back to their old superiority of numbers. In the earlier part of the day,
when the fortunes of Isinglass were still undetermined, the majorities were enormous; and though
there was a certain falling off when sporting gentlemen began to get back from the dusty Downs,
the average was well kept up; and it was with a distinct rise in the temperature of Liberal
hopes and confidence that this stage was reached. On the following day the lowness of the voice
in the Old Man was a little more perceptible, and when it got to midnight, he seemed painfully
fagged and exhausted. It was, perhaps, because he was in that mood that he made some concessions
to the Unionists, which have been somewhat resented. But as these concessions, according to
Mr. Gladstone himself, only carried out what the Government had intended from the first, these
things may be passed. They had reference chiefly to prohibition of raising in Ireland anything
like a military force--even in the shape of a militia or volunteer force. On June 2nd, there
was one of those transformations in which the Old Man is constantly surprising friends and
foes. He was alert, vigorous, watchful of everything that went on, and the voice rose to its
old strength and resonance. It was during that afternoon that there was a slight indication
for the first time throughout the progress of the whole Bill of any dissatisfaction on the
part of the Irish members. Mr. Byrne--one of the Unionist gang of lawyers--proposed a ridiculous
amendment, the effect of which would have been that the Irish Legislature would not have had
the right to give a license for a fowling-piece, or to arm their police to meet a rising of
the Orangemen.

[Sidenote: Mr. Sexton intervenes.]

It was then that Mr. Sexton intervened with a word of warning against such a restriction. In
burning though carefully restrained language, Mr. Sexton replied to a taunt of Mr. Chamberlain
at the silence of the Irish members. I have the modesty. so, who state of property that you occupy

of all this fierce Parliamentary battle.

[Sidenote: And eagerness.]

And what makes it all the more peculiar is that this strange gentleness does not go side by
side with want of interest in the struggle. On the contrary, all those around him and near
him declare that never has Mr. Gladstone been more keen of any subject than he has been on
this Home Rule Bill. He thinks of nothing else; he enjoys it all. I saw a curious instance
of this intensity of his interest about that time. Argument why a Colonel has send to me continue fourteen

 He was met on the following Sunday by a friend, and when
asked how he viewed the situation, declared that he was rather "low!" Why? he was asked. Because
his heart was saddened and enraged by the treatment of the splendid Old Man by Mr. Chamberlain
and the Tories. To a leading Liberal Minister, two Tories privately declared that their pain
and shame and disgust with the conduct of their own side to Mr. Gladstone was so profound,
that they had to get up and leave the House to control their feelings.

[Sidenote: A complex situation.]

When, therefore, Mr. Chamberlain came forward with his audacious complaint, this was the curious
situation: that the bulk of the Liberal party, and many even of their opponents, were convinced
that the comments of the Daily News were more than justified. The frantic cheers with which
each successive sentence of the scathing attack in the description was punctuated by the Liberal
and Irish Benches, as Joe, with affected horror, read them out, sufficiently indicated what
they thought. And, on the other hand, the man in whose defence this reply to his assailants
was made was just as convinced that his enemies had been unjustly assailed, and that he himself
had been well and courteously treated. In such a situation it was just possible that Mr. Chamberlain
would escape from his position with flying colours; would have the Daily News censured for
falsehood by a House of Commons that believed in its truth; and have himself declared chivalrous
by a Parliament that knows him to be malignant, unscrupulous, and merciless. When at duration is

But did it was not been daily plenty.

Towards the end of the sitting there was a certain feverishness of expectation. Dr. McGregor,
a Scotch Highland member, had announced that at half-past six he would move the closure of
the third clause--on which we had now been working for a fortnight. But Mr. Mellor refused
to put such a drastic proposal on the suggestion of a private member. There was, however, a
very plain intimation that if a Minister were to make such a proposal it might be considered
differently; all of which meant that we were approaching--slowly, patiently, forbearingly--but
still approaching the moment when drastic steps would be taken to accelerate progress.

CHAPTER XIII.

THE SEXTON INCIDENT.

[Sidenote: Mr. Sexton.]

The resignation of Mr. Sexton, early in June, seemed to point to one of those disastrous splits
in the Irish ranks which have always come at the wrong moment to spoil the chances of the Irish
cause. There were many whose memories were brought back by the event to that trying and strange
time when Mr. Parnell fought his desperate battle for the continuance of his leadership. They

[Sidenote: To thy orisons.]

It is one of the peculiarities of the House of Commons that the men who are most in want of
spiritual assistance and providential guidance, never seek the assistance of prayer. However
terrible the crisis, however crowded every other inch of space in the House of Commons may
be, though the ungodliest member may be in his place listening to the rich resonance of Archdeacon
Farrar's voice, the Treasury Bench is always empty. To an outsider the explanation may be here
revealed; which is, that if you attend prayers you are entitled to a seat for the remainder
of the evening, whereas if you are absent, you are liable at any moment to be turned out by
your more pious brother. But Ministers are exempt from this general law, for their places are
fixed for them on the Treasury Bench, whatever may happen, and, accordingly, they invariably--I
had almost said religiously--keep away from prayers. Lest I should appear to do injustice,
I may say that the leaders of the Opposition are just as ungodly, and for precisely the same
reason; their seats also are secured to them by standing order; and, accordingly, they also
never enter the House until its devotions for the day are over. There was just one exception
to this. For some reason best known to himself, Sir John Gorst (he is usually at variance with
his friends) had come down early on June 28th, and was in his place with edifying aspect to
listen to the solemn exhortation and the soft responses.

[Sidenote: The shout of battle.]

At twenty minutes past twelve there is a roar in the House; the Old Man has arrived; and there
ascends that bracing cheer with which in our still barbarous times we welcome our champions
on the eve of a big fight. The Old Man has hurried, for he is out of breath; and the deadly
pallor of his cheek is almost affrighting to see. But he soon recovers himself, though when
he rises to speak the breathlessness is still very apparent, and he has to gasp almost now
and then for more voice. Fortunately on this occasion we have not long to wait for the big
announcement which everybody is so anxiously expecting. It is usually the fate of the House
of Commons, whenever something very momentous is under weigh, to have a thousand trivialities
in its path before it gets on to the real business. I have heard something like a hundred questions
asked, most of them very trivial, on more than one night, when the whole of the civilized world
was waiting for the Minister to develop some great plan of Governmental policy. The bore, the
faddist, the empty self-advertiser, is as inevitable on such occasions as the reportorial dog
that always rushes along the Derby course at that dread moment when you can hear the beating
of the gamblers' hearts.

[Sidenote: To business.]

But on this fateful Wednesday there is no such ridiculous intervention. There are only two
questions altogether on the paper; and both of those refer to the great issue of how obstruction
is to be put down. Mr. Gladstone answers the questions very briefly; but there is hidden and
fateful meaning in every syllable he utters; and the House of Commons, looking on, shows itself
in one of those moments which bring out all its picturesqueness--its latent passions--its very
human characteristics. There is the eager strain of curiosity. Every face is turned to that
of the single pale white solitary figure that stands out from the Treasury Bench, dressed,
I may add, in the sober but light grey suit of the summer season, in spite of his being a messenger
of such doom to Tory obstruction. There is a hush, but a hush never lasts long in the House
of Commons when a great party blow is going to be struck. The nerves of the House, raised to
expectancy--tension, almost hysteria, by the joy of the one side, the anger and dread of the
other, have a preternatural readiness in catching points, in producing outbursts of feeling.
And so it is to-day. The Prime Minister has scarcely uttered the words which reveal the determination
of the Government to resort to the most extreme measures, when there burst simultaneously from
the Irish and the Tory Benches cheers and counter cheers--the cheer of pride, joy, and delirium
almost, in the one case; the answering cheer and counter cheer of haughty and angered defiance
in the other.

[Sidenote: Balfour the unready.]

The Old Man bears himself splendidly amidst all this. He is very excited and very resolute--you
can see that by the very deadliness of tranquillity which he seeks to put in his voice, by
the gentleness of his tone, by the almost deprecatory smile. All the same, the prevalent note
of his voice and manner is composure. For the moment, either from surprise, relief, the joy
they can badly conceal--whatever the reason, the Tories seem to be nonplussed. The audacious
ally who is always ready to rush rashly into the breach on such occasions is away in Birmingham;
and with all his excellent qualities, Mr. Balfour is not remarkable for readiness. Accordingly
there is an awkward pause, and no one rises from the Opposition Benches. This is serious, for
first blood tells in Parliamentary as in other prize fights. The Old Man, however, is all alive.
He passes on from this mighty announcement as though he had said nothing in particular, and
taking a bundle of notes--put together with characteristic care and neatness even in the very
centre of all this storm--he proceeds to tell Mr. Goschen something about the currency question,
and the state of the silver market in India. The currency--who cares about the currency now?
Even the hardiest bimetallist cannot be got to think of his hobby in the face of the dread
news just heard. By the time Mr. Gladstone has given his answers, Mr. Balfour has managed to
slightly recover himself, and has framed a question to the Old Man.

[Sidenote: The precedent of 1887.]

When at last the question does come, it is of a very innocent character. The Old Man has declared
that he had not the terms of the resolution ready, but that they would be announced to the
House before its rising in the evening. All Mr. Balfour wishes to know is, what time it will
be when these terms are given. Such is the simple question; but the reply is of a very different
character. It was delivered in studiously moderate terms; the voice of Mr. Gladstone never
rises above a sweet coo; but there is fire, defiance, inflexible determination in every syllable,
and the first blow is struck when the wily Old Man announces--as though it were the merest
business affair--that the closure resolution which the Government will introduce, is founded
upon the principle of the resolution of 1887. He can go no further for several seconds. The
Irish, with their ready wits--their fierce and keen memories--have caught the point at once;
and they burst into a cheer--loud, fierce, and prolonged. What it means is this: In 1887, the
Tories had carried a closure resolution for the purpose of forcing through the Coercion Bill
of that year; and it was under the working of that closure resolution that the Bill had finally
passed the House of Commons, with several of its clauses undebated. What, then, this fierce
Irish cheer meant was that the chickens were coming home to roost; and that the Tories were
now reaping the harvest of their own sowing. With grave face the Old Man waited until the storm
had spent itself, and then he went on to make a little slip, which for the moment gave his
enemies an excellent opening.

[Sidenote: Revolution or resolution.]

He spoke not of the resolution, but of the revolution. He corrected the slip with great rapidity,
but he was not quick enough for his watchful enemies, and loudly--discordantly--triumphantly--they
repeated the word after him--Revolution--Revolution. However, Mr. Gladstone, after his Socratic
fashion, lowered his eyes for a moment and went off into one of those abstract reveries whither
he always allows his fancy to wend its way whenever his opponents are particularly rancorous.
Then he described the resolution--not the revolution--as in the interest of the convenience
and liberty of the House. But he immediately added--with the sweetest smile--that Mr. Balfour
would doubtless form his own judgment on that point; and then, still calm, sweet, with the
tendency to the reverie of the good man grossly misjudged by sinful opponents, he sat him down.

[Sidenote: An awkward moment.]

In the midst of the exultation which the announcement of the Government had produced in the
Liberal ranks, there came a difficulty and a humiliation. An amendment had been proposed, Mr.
Gladstone had twice opposed it, everything pointed to its ignominious rejection, and, in view
of the coming closure, everybody seemed to want rapid despatch. And thus a division was immediately
called. The House was cleared; members rushed in, and, indeed, had already begun to pass through
the lobby; when suddenly there was a complete change of tactics; Mr. Marjoribanks, rushing
to the Treasury Bench, called upon the Government to capitulate. The fact got out; the Government
were in a minority--their forces had not come in time, and the Tories would have beaten us
if they had been allowed to go to a division. It was one of the narrowest shaves--one of the
most uncomfortable quarters of a minute--we have had in the House of Commons for many a long day.

[Sidenote: The fateful moment.]

But half-past five comes at last; then the discussion on the Home Rule Bill has to come to
an end, and the Speaker takes the chair. Members think there is a look of unusual excitement
on his face, that its air is angry; and the Unionists take comfort from the idea that this
step is against his judgment. But, then, it is a matter for the House itself and not for the
decision of the chair, and so we go ahead. Mr. Morley is put up by Mr. Gladstone to read the
words of the resolution. The Old Man himself is composedly writing that letter to the Queen
which it is still his duty daily to indite. Mr. Morley's face betrays under all its studied
calm, the excitement of the hour, and he reads every separate announcement with a certain dramatic
emphasis that brings out all the hidden meaning; and the document is one, the reading of which
lends itself to dramatic effect and to dramatic manifestations. Wear had a tabernacle is described

 When, however, July 19th, and the ninth
clause came we were face to face with a very different state of affairs. Then we had to face
absolute uncertainty--and uncertainty not in one, but almost every part of the House. And the
curious thing about it all was, that this uncertainty was aggravated by a little fact which
had entered into nobody's calculations, and this was the highly technical rule with regard
to the manner in which questions are put when the House is in committee.

[Sidenote: Technicalities.]

I despair of ever being able to make this matter clear to an outsider; and, indeed, to be quite
honest, I am not always sure that I understand the affair myself. It will probably be sufficient
for my purpose if I say that the chairman has to put an amendment in such a way that sometimes
you find you are really precluded from voting on the direct question which you wish to challenge.
You are within the ring-fence of a technical rule, which compels you to fight your issue there
and not one inch outside of it. This often means that questions are raised in the most indirect
way--that you seem to be voting for one thing while you really mean another, and that if you
do not vote that way, you cannot vote any other. So it happened on this occasion. And we drifted
about for the best way of raising the question of the presence of the Irish members, and the
Government were for a while in a state of absolute and painful uncertainty. Then came one of
those desultory conversations on points of order, in which so large a body as the House of
Commons cannot shine--one man suggesting one method, one man another; half-a-dozen different
methods proposed in as many minutes by half-a-dozen different members.

[Sidenote: 103 v. 80.]

At last Mr. Redmond seemed to hit off the situation by a proposal to omit a couple of sub-sections
in the ninth clause. But Mr. Redmond had scarcely spoken when the House found itself in an
extraordinary and most embarrassing dilemma. The object of Mr. Redmond was plain enough; what
he desired to do was to retain the Irish members in the Imperial Parliament in their present,
that is to say, in their full, strength--103 they are now, 103 he wanted them to remain. The
position of the Government was equally clear. With emphatic language--with a superabundance
of argument--Mr. Gladstone stated his conviction that the Irish members should not remain in
such large numbers and that the number should be 80. This was all clear enough; but what about
the position of all the other parties in the House?

[Sidenote: Tot homines, tot sententiæ.]

At first sight, it would appear that this ought to be very clear. The Tories and the Unionists
had several amendments on the paper. One wanted the Irish members reduced to 48, one wanted
to have them reduced to 40, and several of them desired that they should be reduced still further--in
fact, should reach the irreducible minimum of none at all. It was assumed, of course, that
gentlemen who had thus indicated their desire for the reduction of the Irish members, or for
their disappearance altogether, would vote against a proposition which asked that they should
remain in full force. If this course were adopted, Mr. Redmond would be crushed under a combination
of the Liberals, who wanted the numbers to be 80, and the Tories who wanted the Irish members
to disappear altogether; but in these days, and with such an Opposition as we have now in the
House of Commons, it is not possible to make any calculations on what course we would adopt.
To the amazement of the House--above all things to the amazement of Mr. Gladstone--who has
not yet entirely got over the traditions of the past, and, therefore, over-sanguine expectations
as to the scruples of his opponents--Mr. Chamberlain and Mr. Balfour both announced that they
were ready to go into the same lobby as Mr. Redmond. And so those who wanted all the Irish
members, and those who wanted none, were both going to vote exactly the same way.

[Sidenote: A bolt from the blue.]

For a moment everybody was staggered by this declaration; and it produced a combination which
anybody could forecast, and for which nobody was prepared. There came accordingly something
like a panic over the House. Here we were face to face with a Ministerial crisis, with doom
and the abyss and the end of all things. Unexpectedly, in a moment, without a second's warning,
this state of things led to a phenomenon which belongs to the House of Commons alone. Councils
of war are usually held in the silence and secrecy and beneath the impenetrable walls of the
council chamber. But sudden councils of war, called for by unexpected events, have to be held
in the open in the House of Commons. The world--the world of strangers, of ambassadors, of
peers, of ladies, of the constituents, and, above all, the world of watchful, scornful, vindictive
enemies--can look on as though the leaders of the parties were bees working in a glass hive.
And it is impossible for even the best trained men to keep their air and manners in such dread
circumstances from betraying the seriousness and excitement and awe which the gravity of the
events are exciting in them.

[Sidenote: Mr. Gladstone's attitude.]

On the Treasury Bench there was a good deal of excitement, but it was pretty well repressed:
and in the midst of it all is the face of Mr. Gladstone, over-pale, with a strange glitter
in the eyes that made them look unnaturally large, two jets of lambent and almost dazzling
flame, but otherwise very composed, deadly calm. On the Irish Benches the excitement was more
tense, for their course was even more difficult than that of the Government. The Government
had stated their decision that they wanted only eighty members. But there was an Irish member,
a leader of a party which seeks to claim Irish support as a better Irish party than the other,
proposing that Ireland should have her full total of members. The Irish members naturally would
be inclined to support their countrymen, if not to seek to keep the Irish representation as
high as it could possibly be.

[Sidenote: A splendid gambler.]

On the other hand, if all the Irish members went the same way it was all up with the Government.
Some fifty to seventy British Liberals adopt the same policy as the Irish members with regard
to the Irish question and the Home Rule Bill, and if the Irish members only give the word,
they also would vote with Mr. Redmond, and the Government would be "snowed under," to use an
expressive Americanism, a majority of upwards of two hundred against them. Mr. Gladstone had
evidently made up his mind that this was the situation he would have to face, and played his
last, his supreme, his desperate card. You could see that he himself felt that this was the
kind of card he was playing from his look as he played it. There was outward calmness in the
face, there was the same evenness of tone in the voice; he built up his case with the same
unbroken command of his language and ideas as is his usual characteristic. His statement of
his position was admirable in its lucidity, its temper, and its courage. But he was excited.
Just as he rose up, Sir William Harcourt jumped up, and in a state of impatience and excitement
that was palpable, asked for something. It was a glass of water for Mr. Gladstone. The glass
of water was brought in; it was put in front of Mr. Gladstone; he sipped it just as he was
about to start on his perilous oratorical voyage, and then, clearing his throat, he made the
fateful announcement which possibly was to wreck his measure and himself. And the statement
came to this: If the Government were defeated, it would be by a combination of different parties,
but they would all agree in supporting 103 as against 80 Irish members; and if they did that,
why the House was master. This was ambiguous, and yet it was pretty plain. The Government declined
to accept as a vote of want of confidence in them a majority which was obtained by so dishonest
and treacherous a combination as men voting together who were at such opposite poles of thought;
and the Government would just checkmate the little game by accepting the 103 members as what
the House preferred to the Government plan of 80.

[Sidenote: The fall of the flag.]

There was a gleam of almost sardonic triumph in the Old Man's eye as he sat down, having shot
this bolt; and he looked as if he had thoroughly discomfited his enemies. But his enemies were
not so easily discomfited. Treacherous, base, unscrupulous, call it what he liked, they were
not going to miss the opportunity of baiting him: and Mr. Chamberlain's pale face wore a deadlier
pallor. There was even a colder and fiercer ring than usual in his clear, cruel voice; his
always saturnine look deepened as he seemed to grasp beforehand his great and long delayed
hour of vengeance. Mr. Balfour adopted the same tactics. In favour of 103 members? Not at all--the
vote would mean nothing of that kind--it would simply mean that they were opposed to the plan
of the Government; in short, there was the issue quite plain. The Tories and the Unionists
would vote black was white, wrong was right. This way one moment, the other way the next--they
would do anything, provided only they could turn the Government out, defeat the Bill, and humiliate
the Old Man. And so the situation grew more difficult every moment.

For it was now plain that the Government were most certain to be beaten, and that if they were
beaten, there must be an end of Home Rule. It might be good Parliamentary tactics to say that
the Government would accept the decision of the House, but everybody knows what moral authority,
what reality of strength, there is in a Government which has been "snowed under" by a majority
of 200.

[Sidenote: Mr. Sexton makes the running.]

It will now be understood what tremendous issues rested on the speech which Mr. Sexton rose
to deliver. In moments of stress and difficulty he is the man always selected by his colleagues
to state the Irish case. Never in his chequered and stormy early career did that wonderful
Parliamentarian have a task more difficult than that by which he was now confronted. In front
of him was the Government in the very panic of impending ruin. He had only to look across the
floor of the House, and he could see the pallid face of that mighty statesman who lives so
high in the hearts and affections of the people whom Mr. Sexton represents, and who at that
moment was in his hour of agony, if not of final and irretrievable ruin. Behind the Prime Minister
were other men--equally eager to hear what he had to say--that sturdy band of Radicals, mostly
from Scotland, who only wanted the word to desert their own leader and follow the guidance
of the Irish members. Villas. Beginning were pacified for what is this stalls would and perhaps

of his friends.

[Sidenote: Keeping the seats.]

This plain-spoken opinion of Lord Randolph Churchill was induced by the fact that Mr. Gibbs
and his friends had now resolved on a desperate step to secure attention to his complaint.
This was no other than refusing to leave the House, and take part in the division. It is more
than twelve years since this extreme, violent, and almost revolutionary step was adopted before.
On the dreadful night--how well I remember it!--when the news came that Michael Davitt had
been sent back to penal servitude, the information sent a thrill of such horror and almost
despair amongst the Irish Benches, that some method of manifesting their feelings became inevitable.
By a series of circumstances, into which I need not now go, the manifestation took the shape
of refusing to go into the division lobby, and retaining our seats. We were all suspended in
turn, and removed from the House by the Serjeant-at-Arms. 

Me had, but i heard in-day s is going labouchere in be in Hammond

You have some ladies by Ireland? You does find i nothing what is
done there, but'tis which opens the matter. Such one knows of affairs
i have to tell it is the better. Is it was true?
 Among these was Mr. Logan. Mr. Logan peered somewhat
curiously at the angry faces and the shouting figures on the Tory Benches, and approached them
with the view of finding out what it was all about. His air, somehow or other, suggested--quite
wrongly, as it turned out--to the Tories that he was meditating an assault upon some of them:
and there rose angry cries from them of "Bar! Bar!" This, in Parliamentary language, means
that the member is violating the rule against any member standing on the floor of the House,
except in the narrow and short interspace which lies between the entrance door and the bar--a
very small bit of free territory. Logan, in his turn, was exasperated by these remarks, and
used some retort. Then there were renewed cries that he was not in order in standing up on
the floor, together with a multitude of expletives at the expense of his party and himself.
And Mr. Logan thereupon said he would put himself in order, and sat down on the Front Opposition
Bench. In doing so, he certainly did put himself in order, for a member can take his seat where
he likes during the progress of a division. Fried Foodstuff (the Bowl). INGREDIENTS. Condiment, ground, 2, 3, clump.

 This was because of his fitness;
because he was practically the senior officer available, and because he had gained experience
in both regimental and staff duties, having filled with great credit the high office of Commander-in-Chief
at Bombay. Herculean Mr. Allan, of Gateshead, sought for information how many months the Duke
of Connaught was absent from his duties when he commanded at Portsmouth. Young Mr. Dalziel
also came forward, wanting to know whether the Duke would receive the salary of a General or
a Lieutenant-General. Mr. A.C. Morton, who had appropriated for the nonce Mr. T.W. Russell's
usual seat, was anxious for a further explanation of what was meant by the Duke being practically
the senior officer available. He also wanted to know what experience he had had in real fighting.
The reply of the War Minister was conciliatory. There were, he explained, one or two generals
senior to H.R.H., but who were at present discharging duties from which it was not desirable
they should be removed. The pay would be that of a Lieutenant-General. Owing to domestic circumstances,
the Duke lived out of Portsmouth, but he was little out of the district he commanded. He served
in the Egyptian campaign, which was the only opportunity he had had during his career in taking
part in active warfare. This did not satisfy either Mr. Allan or Mr. Morton. The member for
Peterboro' wanted to be precise. How far was H.R.H. away from the real fighting? The War Minister
could only smile and shake his head. Mr. Allan expressed his dissent, and Mr. Morton, derisively
cheered by a handful of Tories, solemnly begged to give notice that on the Army Estimates he
would again raise the question of this flagrant job.

[Sidenote: A triumph for Mr. Burns.]

The evening was notable for a splendid triumph achieved by that fine Democrat, John Burns.
It arose out of the Navy Estimates. The conditions of labour in the Government dockyards have
long been crying out for remedy, and Mr. Burns presented the case for the men with a force
and lucidity that carried conviction home to the minds of a crowded House, among whose members
his is one of the most magnetic personalities. The member for Battersea pointed out that, whilst
he strongly approved of the attitude of the Government in adding £30,000 to the wages of the
men, the real step they should have taken was to ignore the opinion of the permanent officials,
those bugbears of all reformers, past, present, and to come--pay the trades union rates, and
abolish classification altogether. A very excellent smack at Sir John Gorst, Mr. A.B. Forwood,
and other standbacks on the Opposition side was the remark:--"I would rather have the rate
of wages in dockyards regulated by trades unions than made the sport of party politicians and
put up as a kind of Dutch auction." What have the Government to fear in this matter? The trade
unions must always have to face competition and trade rivalry, and these elements alone are
more than sufficient to keep down wages. So great was the impression made by Mr. Burns's speech,
that official notice of it was inevitable, and Mr. E. Robertson was able to make an announcement
which gave, if not absolute satisfaction, at least a measure of it to the champions of the
artificers and labourers in our dockyards.

[Sidenote: Home Rule again.]

It was only the Old Man would have had the daring to begin the third stage of the greatest
Bill of modern times at an hour so inauspicious--noon on a Wednesday sitting. Everybody knows
that among all the dead hours of the House of Commons, there is no hour so utterly dead as
that. Indeed, very often such is the disinclination of the natural man for unreasonable and
unseasonable hours--it is very often extremely difficult for the Whips of the Government to
get together the forty members who are necessary to form the quorum for the starting of business;
and I have known cases where it was close upon two o'clock--if not even later--before there
was a sufficient muster for the beginning of the day's business. However, Mr. Gladstone calculated
correctly on the magic of his name and the witchery of his oratory; for by a few minutes past
twelve, when he rose to make his speech, the House was crowded in almost every part, and he
had an audience not only unprecedented in its fulness at such an hour, but also delightfully
stimulating in its general responsiveness and sometimes even its ready enthusiasm.

[Sidenote: A mighty speech.]

The speech of the Old Man was worthy of the occasion. For some hours after it had ended nobody
had anything to say about anybody or anything else; it was one of those speeches that create
something like rapture; and that oft-repeated declaration that he had never done anything like
it before--a declaration I have heard too many times to now altogether accept. The voice was
splendid, the diction very fine, the argument close and well knit, the matter carefully prepared
without any selfish adherence to the letter of a manuscript--a fidelity which always spoils
anything like spontaneity of oratory. And the Old Man was in splendid physical condition and
in the brightest of spirits. Indeed, I was never more struck with the extraordinary physical
perfection which Mr. Gladstone's frame has maintained after his eighty-three years of full
active and wearing life. The back was straight, the figure erect, the motions free, unconstrained,
easy; the gestures those of a man whose every joint moved easily in a fresh and vigorous frame.
And the face was wonderfully expressive, now darkened with passionate hatred of wrong, now
bursting into the sunshine of genial and pleasant smiles. And--as is usual when he is in this
mood--he was extraordinarily quick at taking interruptions; he was, indeed, almost boisterous
in his manner, and seemed to positively invite those interjectional interventions from the
other side, which, in less exuberant moods he is sometimes inclined to resent. Mr. Chaplin
had quoted a portentous passage from Cavour to show that the great Italian statesman had declared
against Home Rule. Mr. Gladstone was able to cap this with another passage--which, beginning
with a strong indictment of English methods of government in Ireland, wound up with the declaration
that Ireland ought to be treated with the same justice and generosity as Canada. While the
Liberals were still cheering this thrust, Mr. Chaplin got up to make the remark that Cavour
had said other things quite contradictory of this, whereupon the Old Man--still with a smile
of deadly courtesy--pounced upon Mr. Chaplin with the remark, "Is it your case, then, that
Cavour contradicted himself?"--a retort, the rapidity and completeness of which crushed Mr.
Chaplin for the moment.

[Sidenote: Cowed silence of the Tories.]

When he dealt with the charge that the Government had unduly curtailed debate, the Old Man
had made up his case very thoroughly, and as he read the damning indictment which showed the
wild multitudinousness, the infinite variety and the prolonged duration of the speeches of
the Opposition, there was plenty of encouraging cheers from the Liberal side; while on the
Tory Benches they sat in dumb and stricken silence. Indeed, throughout the whole speech, the
Tories were singularly quiet. Perhaps it was that they too were carried away by the witchery
and the spell which the Old Man had cast over the rest of the House; and, while disagreeing
with him, were still sufficiently wound up to the lofty and more empyrean heights which the
orator reached to feel that there would be something jarring and even common in a note of dissent.
Whatever the reason, they remained uncommonly silent throughout the whole speech; and, sometimes,
when one or two of the more ebullient members spoke, the interjectors got very little change
for their pains.

 Altogether it was a fine speech--worthy of the man, worthy of his career,
worthy of the great and historic occasion.

[Sidenote: Funereal Devonshire.]

I wish I could say as much of the speech of the Duke of Devonshire. It may be that his miserable
failure was due to the fact that he is as yet unaccustomed to the House of Lords, and that
the modesty which is undoubtedly one of his disadvantages as a public speaker has not yet been
overcome; but his speech was a return to the very worst manner of his earlier days in the House
of Commons. I have heard the Duke of Devonshire in his early manner and in his late; and his
early manner was about as detestable as a man's manner could have been. He had a habit of sinking
his voice as he approached the end of a sentence, so that a sentence beginning on a high note
gradually sank to a moan, and a murmur, and a gulp. The whole effect was mournful in the extreme,
and gave you a sense of the weariness and the worthlessness of all human life such as the most
eloquent ascetic could never succeed in imparting. In the House of Lords, the Duke of Devonshire
suddenly returned to his early and bad manner, and delivered a speech which was more like a
funeral oration than a call to arms.

[Sidenote: Lord Ribblesdale.]

Of the remaining speeches I need say little. Lord Brassey, in a few manly and straightforward
words, expressed his entire sympathy with the principle of the Bill; Lord Cowper gave another
very melancholy and inaudible performance. And then came one of the most remarkable speeches
the House of Lords has heard for some time. From the Treasury Bench there stood a tall, slight,
and rather delicate figure. The face, long, large-featured, hatchet-shaped, was surmounted
with a mass of curling-hair; altogether, there was a suggestion of what Disraeli looks like
in that picture of him as a youth which contrasts so strangely and sadly with the figure and
the face we all knew in his later days. This was Lord Ribblesdale. Lord Ribblesdale holds an
office in the Royal Household in the present Administration. Up to a short time ago, he was
unknown in even the teeming ranks of noble littérateurs; but an article he wrote on a conversation
with the late Mr. Parnell gave indications of a bright and apt pen, a great power of observation,
and a shrewd, impartial mind. On Sept. 4th, he surprised the House by showing also the possession
of very rare and very valuable oratorical powers, His speech was excellent in diction, was
closely and calmly reasoned, and produced an extraordinary effect, even on the Tory side, which,
beginning by a stony silence, and a certain measure of curiosity--ended by giving an impression
of being moved, and even awed a little by this speech. Altogether a very remarkable performance;
we have not heard the last now that we have heard the first of Lord Ribblesdale in the fields
of party oratory.

[Sidenote: A striking personality.]

The Duke of Argyll has changed a good deal in physical appearance during the last twenty years.
There was a time when he was was robust and squat, a rather stout little man, with a slightly
strutting manner, head thrown back, and very fine and spacious forehead; a head of hair as
luxurious and drooping as that of Mary Magdalene. The form has considerably shrunk with advanced
years, but not with any disadvantage, for the face, pinched and lined though it appears, has
a finer and more intellectual look than that of earlier days. Wrong-headed--perhaps very self-conceited--at
all events, entirely left behind by the advancing democratic tide, the Duke of Argyll is yet
always to me a sympathetic and striking figure. If he thinks badly, at least he thinks originally.
His thoughts are his own, and nobody else's; and though he is a bitter controversialist, at
least he feels the weight and gravity of the vast questions on which he pronounces. Above all
things, he has a touch of the divine in his oratory. He is, indeed, almost the last inspired
speaker left in the House of Lords. There is another speaker, of whom more presently, with
extraordinary gifts, with also true oratorical powers, capable of producing mighty effects;
but with Lord Rosebery the light is very clear and very dry; there is none of the softness
and brilliancy, and poetic and imaginative insight which are to be found in the speeches of
the Duke of Argyll. On September 6th the Duke used very vehement and some very whirling language
about Mr. Gladstone; his reading of history was all wrong; his policy for Ireland was--to put
it plainly--brutal. But what cannot be forgiven to a man who has still such a beautiful voice--who
still gesticulates so beautifully--and, above all, who is capable of rising to the height of
some of the passages in the speech on this particular Wednesday? For instance, what could have
been more beautiful than that passage in which he put the argument that Ireland was too near
to be treated in the same way as a distant colony--the passage in which he spoke of seeing
from the Scotch Highlands the sun shining on the cornfields and cottage windows of Antrim?

 This is partly the reason of the lighter tone of the earlier
observations which offended some too sensitive critics. Indeed, it might have seemed for some
time as if Lord Rosebery got up with the idea of treating the whole business as the merest
unreality of comedy; and had resolved to signify this by refusing to treat either the House
or the Bill or himself seriously. In face of the tragedies of the Irish sphinx--with all its
centuries of brooding sorrow behind it, this was not a tone which commended itself to the judicious.
But, then, this was a too hasty criticism. The light and almost chaffing introduction was necessary
in the highest interests of art; for, as I have said, the House was depressed, and it was in
no mood to listen to an orator whose creed appeared to it the merest rank treason. When did the leaves

 Such
an attitude--exalted by the even, though powerful, the cold, though penetrating voice--the
face impassive and inscrutable--the eye, steady, unmoving, and unreadable--all this, I say,
was just the kind of thing to produce an immense impression on those who are ready only to
accept Home Rule as the policy that pays best.

[Sidenote: Even the Peers impressed.]

And certainly the House of Lords was wonderfully impressed by this attitude. There was no applause,
except now and then from those skeleton ranks that lay behind Lord Rosebery, but then there
was in the whole air that curious and almost audible silence--to use a conscious paradox--which
conveys to the trained ear clearer sounds of absorption and attention than the loudest cheers. Boil

not sweet who, a marmalade, and 6 cloves.

 And,
in spite of its lethargy, its hatred of his opinions, the House of Lords felt this also, and
there was something of awe in the silence with which it listened to the ringing words of warning
with which the speech concluded. And its attitude showed more. It was, so to speak, a soul's
awakening; it was the discovery of having found at last a man who could sway, impress, and
strike its imagination.

[Sidenote: Salisbury's signal failure.]

On Friday night, September 8th, Lord Salisbury had his opportunity of undoing this great effect--of
reasserting that intellectual as well as mere voting dictatorship which he holds in the House
of Lords; and he signally failed to rise to the occasion. I do not like the policy of Lord
Salisbury, but there is a lucidity, a point, and sometimes a vigour in his speeches which make
them usually charming reading. It was, therefore, with the full expectation of being interested
that I listened to him, but he drove me out of the House by the impossibility of my keeping
awake under the influence of his dull, shallow, and disappointing speech. He began with a little
touch of nature that certainly was prepossessing. He had brought in with him a dark-brown bottle,
like the bottle one associates with seltzer water. The fluid was perfectly clear; it was evidently
not like the strong wine which Prince Bismarck used to require in the days when he used to
make great speeches. And Lord Salisbury, as he poured out a draught--it looked very like Johannis
water--lifted up the bottle to the Ministers opposite with a pleasant smile, as though to prove
to them that he was not offending against even the sternest teetotal code.
