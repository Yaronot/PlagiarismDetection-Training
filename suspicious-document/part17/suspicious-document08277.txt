PREFACE.

These sketches are taken from a series written originally for newspaper purposes.  Revision
of them has made their author keenly conscious of their defects; but Bawbie and Sandy are characters
who might be completely spoiled by improvement.  The sketches are therefore presented as they
were hastily "rubbed-in" for serial publication.

The "foo," "far," "fat," and "fan" of the Angus dialect have been changed into the more classic
"hoo," "whaur," &c.; otherwise the sketches remain in the form in which they have gained quite
an unexpected popularity amongst Scottish readers both at home and abroad.

MY MAN SANDY.

I

SANDY SWAPS HIS POWNEY.

He's a queer cratur, my man Sandy!  He's made, mind an' body o' him, on an original plan a'thegither.
He says an' does a' mortal thing on a system o' his ain; Gairner Winton often says that if
Sandy had been in the market-gardenin' line, he wudda grown his cabbage wi' the stocks aneth
the ground, juist to lat them get the fresh air aboot their ruits.  It's juist his wey, you
see.  I wudna winder to see him some day wi' Donal' yokit i' the tattie-cairt wi' his heid
ower the fore-end o't, an' the hurdles o' him whaur his heid shud be.  I've heard Sandy say
that he had an idea that a horse cud shuve far better than poo; an' when Sandy ance gets an
idea intil his heid, there's some beast or body has to suffer for't afore he gets redd o't.
If there's a crank wey o' doin' onything Sandy will find it oot.  For years he reg'larly flang
the stable key ower the gate efter he'd brocht oot Donal' an' the cairt.  When he landit hame
again, he climbed the gate for the key, an' syne climbed ower again an' opened it frae the
ootside.  He michta carried the key in his pooch; but onybody cudda dune that!  But, as I was
sayin', it's juist his wey.

"It's juist the shape original sin's ta'en in Sandy's case," the Gairner said when the Smith
an' him were discussin' the subject.

"I dinna ken aboot the sin; but it's original eneuch, there's nae doot aboot that," said the Smith.

There's naebody kens that better than me, for I've haen the teuch end o' forty year o't.  But,
still an' on, he's my ain man, the only ane ever I had, an' I'll stick up for him, an' till
him, while the lamp holds on to burn, as the Psalmist says.

      *      *      *      *      *      *

"See if I can say my geog, Bawbie," said Nathan to me the ither forenicht, as I was stanin'
in the shop.  He'd been sittin' ben the hoose wi' his book croonin' awa' till himsel' aboot
Rooshya bein' boundit on the north by the White Sea, an' on the sooth by the Black Sea, an'
some ither wey by the Tooral-ooral mountains or something, an' he cam' ben an' handed me his
geog, as he ca'd it, to see if he had a' this palaver on his tongue.

I've often windered what was the use o' Nathan wirryin' ower thae oot-o'-the-wey places that
he wud never be within a thoosand mile o'. He kens a' the oots an' ins o' Valiparaiso, but
michty little aboot Bowriefauld.  Hooever, I suppose the dominie kens best.

Nathan was juist busy pointin' oot the place to me in his book when there was a terriple rattlin'
oot on the street, an' aff he hookited to see what was ado.  He thocht it was a marriage, an'
that there micht be a chance o' some heys aboot the doors.  What was my consternation when
the reeshlin' an' rattlin' stoppit at the shop door, an' I heard Sandy's voice roarin', "Way-wo,
haud still, wo man, wo-o-o, will ye!"

"What i' the face o' the earth's ado noo?" says I to mysel'; an' I goes my wa's to the door.
Sandy had been up at Munromont for a load o' tatties.  When I gaed to the door, here he was
wi' a thing atween the shafts o' his cairt that lookit like's it had been struck wi' forkit
lichtnin'.

"What hae ye dune wi' Donal', Sandy?" I speered.

"Cadger Gowans an' me's haen a swap," says Sandy, climbin' oot at the back o' the cairt, an'
jookin' awa' roond canny-weys to the horse's heid.

"Wo, Princie," he says, pettin' oot his hand.  "Wo, the bonnie laddie!"

Princie, as he ca'd him, ga'e a gley roond wi' the white o' his e'e that garred Sandy keep
a gude yaird clear o' him.

"He's a grand beast," he says, comin' roond to my side; "a grand beast! Three-quarters bred,
an' soond in wind and lim'.  I got a terriple bargain o' him.  I ga'e Gowans Donal' an' thirty
shillin's, an' he ga'e me a he tortyshall kitlin' to the bute--the only ane i' the countryside.
He's genna hand it in the morn."

There was nae want o' soond in Princie's wind at ony rate.  I saw that in a minute.  He was
whistlin' like a lerik.

"He sooks wind a little when he has a lang rin," says Sandy; "but that's nether here nor there.
He's haen a teenge or twa, an' he's akinda foondered afore, an' a little spavie i' the aft
hent leg; but I'll shune pet that a' richt wi' gude guidin'.  He's a grand beast, I tell ye!"

Sandy stood an' lookit first up at the horse an' then doon at his cairt.  "He's gey high for
the wheels," he says; "but, man, he's a grand beast.  He cam hame frae Glesterlaw juist like
a bird.  Never turned a hair.  He's a grand beast."

"Hoo mony legs has he, Sandy?" says I, lookin' at the great, big, ravelled-lookin' brute. 
He was a' twisted here and there, an' the legs o' him lookit for a' the world juiat like bits
o' crunckled water-hose. The cairt appeared to be haudin' him up, raither than him haudin'
up the cairt; an' he was restin' the thrawn legs o' him time aboot, juist like a cock stanin'
amon' snaw.  "Ye shudda left that billie at the knackers at Glesterlaw, Sandy," says I, I says.
"I'm dootin' ye'll ha'e back to tak' him there afore him or you's muckle aulder."

"Tyach!  Haud your lang tongue," says Sandy.  "Speak aboot things ye ken something aboot. 
Wait till the morn.  Ye'll see I'll get roond my roonds an' a' my tatties delivered in half
the time.  I'll ha'e rid o' a' my tatties an' be hame gin ane o'clock, instead o' dotterin'
awa' wi' a lazy brute like Donal'.  I'll beat ye onything ye like, Gowans 'ill be ruin' his
bargain gin this time; but he'll no' get him back noo.  I'll go an' see an' get Princie stabled."

Sandy gaed inby to the shafts, but he sprang back when Princie ga'e a squeek an' garred his
heels play tnack on the boddom o' the cairt.

"That's the breedin'," says Sandy, gaen awa' roond to the ither side o' the cairt.

"It soonded to me like the boddom o' the cairt, as far as I cud hear," says I, I says; but
Sandy never lut on.

The brute had a nesty e'e in its heid.  It turned roond wi' a vegabon'-like look aye when Sandy
gaed near't.  He got up on the front efter a while, an' ga'e the reinds a tit, an' Princie
began to do a bit jeeg, garrin' Sandy bowse aboot on the front o' the cairt like's he was foo.
Sandy ga'e him a clap on the hurdles to quieten him, but aye the hent feet o' him played skelp
on the boddom o' the cairt, till I thocht he wudda haen't ca'd a' to bits.  Syne awa' he gaed
full bung a' o' a sudden, wi' Sandy rowin' aboot amon' the tatties, an' hingin' in by the reinds,
roarin', "Wo! haud still," an' so on.  Gin he got to the fit o' the street there was a dozen
laddies efter him; screamin', "Come on you lads, an' see Sandy Bowden's drumadairy.  By crivens,
he's gotten a richt horse for Donal', noo."

Sandy didna come up frae the stable till near-hand eleven o'clock, an' I didna say ony mair
aboot his braw horse.  I've heard the minister say, it's the unexpectit that happens.  That's
aye the way wi' Sandy, I can tell you.  I aye expect that something will happen wi' him that
I'm no' expectin'; so I find it best juist to lat him aleen.

Next mornin' he gaed awa' gey early to get yokit, an' he took Bandy Wobster wi' him to gi'e
him a hand.  It was twa strucken 'oors afore he got to the shop door wi' the cairt, an' baith
him an' the horse were sweitin' afore they startit on his roonds.  Sandy was lookin' gey raised
like, so I lut him get on a' his tatties an' said naething.

Stumpie Mertin cam' by, an', lookin' at Princie, gae his heid a claw.

"What are ye stanin' glowerin' at?" says Sandy till him, gey snappit like.

"Whaur did ye get that hunger'd-lookin' radger, Sandy?" says he.  "That beast's no' fit for
gaen aboot.  The Cruelty to Animals 'ill nip you, as shure's you're a livin' man."

"Tak' care 'at they dinna nip you, for haein' a wid leg," says Sandy, as raised as a wasp.
"Awa' oot o' that, an' mind your ain bisness."

"That's been stealt oot ahent some menagerie caravan," says Stumpie; an' awa' he gaed dilpin'
like's he'd made a grand joke.

The policeman cam' doon an' settled himsel' aboot ten yairds awa' frae Princie, put his hands
ahent his back, set forrit his heid like's he was gaen awa' to putt somebody, an' took a lang
look at him.  "That's a clinker, Sandy," says he.  "That billie 'ill cover the grund."

I didna ken whether the bobbie meant rinnin' ower the grund, or coverin't efter he was turned
into gooana or bane-dust; but I saw the lauch in his sleeve a' the same.

Gairner Winton cam' doon the street at the same time, an' the bobby an' him startit to remark
aboot Sandy's horse.

"A gude beast, nae doot," says the Gairner; "but Sandy's been gey lang o' buyin' him.'

"He's bocht him gey sune, I'm thinking," says the policeman.  "Gin he'd waited a fortnicht,
he'd gotten him at twintypence the hunderwecht."

Sandy never lut dab 'at he heard them.  The cairt was a' ready an' Sandy got up on the front
and startit.  A' gaed richt till he got to the Loan, when Princie startit to trot.  The rattlin'
o' the scales at the back o' the cairt fleggit him, an' aff he set at full tear, the lang skranky
legs o' him wallopin' about like torn cloots atween him an' the grund.  A gude curn wives were
oot waitin' their tatties, an' they roared to Sandy to stop; but Sandy cudna.  The tatties
were fleein' ower the back door o' the cairt, an' the scales were rattlin' an' reeshlin' like
an earthquake; an' there was Sandy, bare-heided, up to the knees amon' his tatties, ruggin'
an' roarin', like the skipper o' some schooner that was rinnin' on the rocks.  I'll swear,
Sandy got roond his roonds an' a' his tatties delivered in less than half the time Donal' took!
The wives an' laddies were gaitherin' up the tatties a' the wey to Tutties Nook; and gin Sandy
got to the milestane his cairt was tume.  By this time Princie was fair puffed out, an' he
drappit i' the middle o' the road, Sandy gaen catma ower the tap o' him.

Donal's back till his auld job!  Sandy lost thirty shillin's an' a cairt-load o' tatties ower
the heid o' Princie; an' as for the he tortyshall kitlin', I've never heard nor seen hint nor
hair o't.

II.

SANDY STARTS TO STUDY GEOMETRY.

"Man, Bawbie, I think I'll see an' get into the Toon Cooncil some o' thae days," says Sandy
to me the ither forenicht.  "Me an' some o' the rest o' the chaps have been haein' a bit o'
an argeyment i' the washin'-house this nicht or twa back, an' I tell you, I can gabble awa'
aboot public questions as weel's some o' them i' the Cooncil.  I ga'e them a bit screed on
the watter question on Setarday nicht that garred them a' gape; an' Dauvit Kenawee said there
an' then that I shud see an' get a haud o' the Ward Committee an' get a chance o' pettin' my
views afore them.  They a' said I was a born spowter, an' that wi' a little practice I cud
speechify the half o' the Cooncil oot at the door."

I hit Sandy blether awa' for a whilie, an' syne I strikes in, "Ay, juist that, Sandy; but you'll
mibby g'wa' an' get that tume saft soap barrel scraipit oot, an' the wechts gi'en a black lead;
an' we'll hear aboot the Toon Cooncil efter your wark's dune."

"Oh, but I'll manish that, Bawbie," says he, gey snappish-like; "but still a man wi' brains
in's heid canna juist be setisfeed wi' saft soap an' black lead a'thegither."

"Ow weel," says I, "you wud mibby fa' in wi' a fell lot o' baith o' them, even i' the Toon
Cooncil.  When you're wantin' a favour, a little saft soap--altho' it's only scraipins--is
sometimes a very handy thing to hae; an' if you dinna get what you want, you can pet on the
black lead syne.  There's a fell lot o' that kind o' thing gaen on, an' nae mistak'.  There's
Beylie Thingymabob, for instance--but, of coorse, that's no' the point----"

"What I was sayin'," brock in Sandy, "was that when a man's heid's fu' o' brains, an' them
wirkin' juist like barm, he maun hae some occupation for his intelleck, or his facilties 'ill
gie wey.  There's Bandy Wobster, for instance, tak's up his heid wi' gomitry an' triangles
an' siclike, juist 'cause he has some brains in his heid, an' maun occupy them; an' what for
no' me as weel?"

"Gomitry an' triangles!" says I.  "Ye'll mibby be for into the flute band next, are ye?  Weel,
I'll tell you this--I ken naething aboot the gomitry, or what like a thing it is; but if you
bring ony o' your triangles here, wi' there ping ping-pinkey-pingin', I'll pet them doon the
syre; that's what I'll do.  I like music o' near ony kind.  I can pet up wi' the melodian or
the concertina; but yon triangle thing I wudna hae i' the hoose.  You can tell Bandy Wobster
he can keep his triangles for his parrots swingin' on.  We want neen o' them here."

"Tut, Bawbie, 'oman," says Sandy, "you're juist haiverin' straucht forrit.  It's no' flute
band triangles I mean ava.  It's the anes you see in books--a' shapes an' sizes, ye know. 
Bandy learned a' aboot them when he was at the sea.  Sailors learn aboot them for measurin'
hoo far onywey is frae ony ither wey, d'ye know, d'ye see?  Bandy tells me that gomitry--that's
what they ca' the book fu' o' triangles--is a grand thing for learnin' you to speak; an' he
offered to gi'e me a lesson or twa."

"That'll be whaur Bandy gets a' his gab," says I.  "I think, Sandy," I says, says I, "that
you've mair need to learn something to garr you haud your tongue.  You've nae need for learnin'
to speak, weel-a-wat, excep' it be to speak sense; an' I dinna suppose gomitry 'ill do you
ony guid that wey.  It's made but a puir job o' Bandy Wobster, at onyrate."

"That's a' you ken, Bawbie," says Sandy.  "There's mair in Bandy than the spune pets in; mind
I'm tellin' you.  He was tellin's aboot some o' the exyems in gomitry lest nicht, an', I'll
swag, he garred Cocky Baxter, the auld dominie, chowl his chafts."

"Exyems!" says I.  "Is that the same as exy-oey we used to play at on oor sklates at the skule?"

"No, no, no, no, no," says Sandy.  "What are you haiverin' aboot, Bawbie?  It's a different
kind o' thing a'thegither.  The first exyem is that onything that's equal to the same thing
as ony ither thing, is equal to the thing that's equal to the thing to which the ither thing's
equal, d'ye know, d'ye see?"

"By faigs, Sandy," says I, "that's waur than exy-oey yet.  What was't you said?"

"It's as plain as twice-twa's fower, Bawbie, if you juist watch," says Sandy.  "If ae thing
is equal till anither thing, an' the ither thing's equal to some ither thing that's equal to
the thing that the first thing's equal till, then you can easy see that the ae thing 'ill be
equal to the ither, as weel as to the ither thing that they're baith equal till."

I thocht Sandy was raley gettin' akinda lichtwecht, d'ye ken, for I cud nether mak' heid nor
tail o' his confused blethers.

"Keep me, Bawbie, do you no' see through't?" he says, glowerin' at me wi' a queer-like look
in his e'e.  "Gie's three bawbees!  Look now; there's thae three bawbees.  Weel than, here's
twa here, an' there's ane there.  Noo, this ane here is equal to that ane there, an' this ither
ane here is equal to that ane there too; so that, when they're baith equal to that ane, the
teen maun be equal to the tither.  A blind bat cud see that wi' its een shut."

Sandy set himsel' up like's he'd pey'd a big account or something, an', gien his heid a gey
impident cock to the tae side, he says, "D'ye no' see't?"

"See't?" says I, I says.  "What wud bender's frae seein't?   An' is that what gomitry learns
you?" says I.

"It is that," says Sandy.  "That's the first exyem."

"Weel," says I, "it tak's a michty lang road to tell you what ony three-'ear-auld bairn in
the G-O goes cud tell you in a jiffy."

"Ah, but it's the mental dreel that's the vailable thing," says Sandy. "It learns you to argey,
d'ye no' see?  If I had a glisk at gomitry for a nicht or twa, an' got a puckle triangles an'
parilelly grams into my heid, I'll be fit to gie a scrieve on the watter question, or the scaffies'
wadges, that'll garr some o' oor Toon Cooncillers crook their moos.  Wait till you see!"

"Ay, Sandy," says I, "you'll go an' get the swine suppered an' your ither jobs dune, an', gin
ten o'clock were here, you'll get a coo's drink, wi' plenty o' pepper in't, an' get to your
bed.  Thae washin'-hoose argeymints are affectin' your nervous system, I'm dootin'.  Rin, noo,
an' see an' stick in."

I raley thocht, mind you, the wey the cratur was haiverin', that he wantit tippence i' the
shillin'.

"I wad juist like you to hear ane o' oor debates, an' you'd cheenge your opinion," says Sandy.
"Bandy promised to tell's something the morn's nicht aboot the postylate in gomitry.  I juist
wiss you heard him."

"What wud there be to hear aboot that?" says I.  "Oor ane's juist the very same; he's near-hand
aye late."

"Wha?" says Sandy, wi' a winderin' look in his e'e.

"Oor postie!" says I; "he's aye late.  You'll of'en hear his whistle i' the street when it's
efter ten o'clock at nicht."

Sandy gaed shauchlin' oot at the door, chuck-chuck-chuckin' awa' till himsel' like a clockin'
hen, an' I didna see hint nor hair o' him for mair than twa 'oors efter.  But what cud ye expeck?
That's juist aye the wey o' thae men when they get the warst o't.

III.

SANDY AND THE DINNER BELL,

Crack aboot holidays!  I tell you, I'd raither do a day's washin' an' cleaning', ay, an' do
the ironin' an' manglin' efter that, than face anither holiday like what Sandy an' me had this
week.  Holiday!  It's a winder there wasna a special excursion comin' hame wi' Sandy's bur'al.
If that man's no' killed afore lang, he'll be gettin' in amon' thae anarkist billies or something.
I tell you he's fit eneuch for onything.

We took the cheap trip to Edinboro, juist to hae a bit look round the metrolopis, as Sandy
ca'd it to the fowk i' the train.  He garred me start twa-three times sayin't; I thocht he'd
swallowed his pipe-shank, he gae sic a babble.

We wasna weel startit afore he begude wi' his nonsense.  There was a young bit kimmerie an'
a bairnie i' the carriage, an' the craturie grat like onything.  "I winder what I'll do wi'
this bairn?" said the lassie; an' Sandy, in the middle o' argeyin' wi' anither ass o' a man
that the Arbroath cricketers cud lick the best club i' the country, says, rale impident like
to the lassie, "Shuve't in ablo the seat."

"You hertless vegabon," says I; "think shame o' yoursel!  Gie me the bairnie," says I; an'
I got the craturie cowshined an' quieted.

There was nae mair nonsense till we cam till a station in Fife wi' an' awfu'-like name.  I
canna mind what it was, an' never will, I suppose. The stationmester had an awfu' reed nose--most
terriple.

"Is the strawberries a gude crap roond aboot here?" said Sandy till him, out at the winda;
an' you never heard what lauchin' as there was on the pletform.  The stationmester's face got
as reed's his nose, an' he ca'd Sandy for a' the impident whaups that ever travelled.

Sal, Sandy stack up till him, though; an' when the train moved awa' the fowk hurrehed like's
it had been a royal marriage.  The stationmester didna hurreh ony.

Gaen ower the Forth Brig I thocht twa-three times Sandy wud be oot at the window heid-lang.
I was juist in a fivver wi' him an' his ongaens. Hooever, we landit a' richt in Edinboro. 
An' what a day!  I thocht when we got to a temperance hotel at nicht that I had a chance o'
an 'oor's peace.  But haud your tongue!  Weesht!  I'll juist gie you the thick o' the story
clean aff luif.

It was a rale comfortable-lookin' hoose, and we got a nice clean-lookin' bedroom, an' efter
a'thing was arranged, Sandy an' me gaed awa' doon as far as Holyrood, whaur Queen Mary got
ane o' her fiddlers killed, an' whaur John Knox redd her up for carryin' on like a pagan linkie
instead o' the Queen o' Scotland.  Weel, it was gey late when we got back to oor hotel, an'
we juist had a bit snack o' supper, an' up the stair we gaed.  We were three stairs up.  We
had a seat, an' a crack an' a look oot at the winda, for we saw a lang wey ower the toun, an'
it was bonnie to watch the lichts twinklin' an' to hear the soonds.

Twal o'clock chappit, an' we thocht it was time we were beddit.  I was anower, an' Sandy was
juist a' ready, when he cudna fa' in wi' his nichtkep.  It was in a handbag o' Sandy's, and
he had left it doon in the lobby.  Sandy canna sleep without his nichtkep--no' him!

"What am I genna do?" says Sandy.  He was in his lang white nichtgoon, and he gaed to the room
door an' opened it.  He lookit oot, but a'thing was as quiet's death.

"I'll rin doon for't," says he; "a'body's beddit.  I'll juist rin doon, an' I'll bring up my
umberell an' my hat at the same time, for fear they micht be liftit.  You never can tell."

Awa' doou the stairs he gaed in his lang nichtgoon, for a' the earth juist like some corp escapit
frae the kirkyaird.  He wasna a meenit oot when I dreedit something wud happen, an' I juist
sat up tremblin' in the bed.

Sandy got doon to the lobby a' richt; an' a'thing was dark, an' as still's the grave.  He scrammilt
aboot till he got the bag; syne he fand for his lum hat, an' put it on his heid.  He got his
umberell in his oxter, an' the bag in his hand, an' then he fand roond juist to see if there
was naething else he had forgotten.  By ill-fortune he cam' on the handle o' the denner bell,
an' liftin't, it ga'e a creesh an' a clang that knokit a' the sense oot o' Sandy's heid, and
wauken'd half the fowk i' the hoose.  Sandy took till his heels up the stair; an' a gey like
picture he was, wi' his lang, white sark-tails fleein' i' the air, a lum hat on his heid, an
umberell in his oxter, the bag in ae hand, an' the denner bell i' the ither, bangin' an' clangin'
at ilky jump.  It wudda frichten'd the very deevil himsel'.  The stupid auld fule had gotten
that doited that he cam' fleein' awa' wi' the bell in his hand.

There was a cry o' fire, and a scream o' murder, an' in half a meenit the hotel was as busy
as gin it had been broad daylicht.  Sandy forgot hoo mony stairs he had to clim', and he gaed
bang in on an auld sea captain an' his wife, in the room below oors.  It fair paralised baith
o' them, when they saw Sandy comin' burst in on them wi' his black tile, his white goon, his
umberell an' bag, an' the denner bell.

"P'leece, p'leece," roared the captain an' his wife--an' Sandy oot at the door.  Awa' alang
a passage he gaed, fleein' like a huntit tod.  I heard him as gin he'd been doon in the very
bowels o' the earth cryin', "Bawbie, Bawbie!  Oh, whaur are ye, Bawbie?"

"Wha i' the earth is he, or what's ado wi' him?" I heard somebody speer.

"Gude kens," said anither voice.  "It's shurely some milkman wi' the bloo deevils."

"Milkman!  What wud a milkman do wi' an umberell, a portmanty, an' a lum hat?"

Juist at that meenit Sandy cam' fleein' alang the passage again, an' by this time a' the fowk
in the hotel were oot on the stairs.  If you had only seen the scrammel.  They scoored doon
the stairs, into pantries, in below tables; the room doors were bangin' like thunder, an' Sandy's
bell was ringin' like's Gabriel had lost his trumpet.  You never heard sic a din.  I saw him
comin' leggin' up the stair.  The stairheid was fu' o' fowk, a' oot in their nicht-goons to
see what was ado; but, I can ashure you, when they saw Sandy comin' fleein' up, they shune
disappeared.  Six policemen cudna scattered them so quick.  He came spankin' into my room,
an' drappit intil a chair, fair oot o' pech.

"Oh, Bawbie, Bawbie!" he cried, "gi'e's a drink.  Tak' that umberell," he says, haudin' oot
the bell to me.  "I've been fleein' a' roond Edinboro wi' naething on but my nicht-goon, an'
my lum, an' a' the coal cairters i' the kingdom ringin' their bells at my tails.  Sic a wey
o' doin'!  O dear me!  I wiss I was hame again!  O dear me!"

"That's no an umberell, you doited fule," says I.  "That's the denner bell you've been fleein'
aboot wi' i' your hand."

Sandy lookit at the bell; an' you never saw sic a face as he put on. He lut it drap on the
flure wi' a clash like a clap o' thunder, an' I heard a crood o' fowk scurryin' awa' frae oor
bedroom door.

I tell'd the landlord hoo the thing happened, an' next mornin' at brakfast time you never heard
sic lauchin'.  A' the chaps were clappin' Sandy on the shuder; an' ane o' them says--"Ay, man;
it's no mony fowk that tak's their lum hat an' their umberell to their bed wi' them."

But the auld skipper was the king amon' them a'.  Hoo he raggit Sandy aboot bein' a somnambulashinist
or something.

"When you want to steal a denner bell," he said to Sandy, "carry't by the tongue, man.  It's
safer that wey.  Bells an' weemin are awfu' beggars when their tongues get lowse."

The captain was rale taen wi' Sandy, an', mind you, he hired a cab an' drave Sandy an' me a'
roond the toon.  He said he was bidin' in Carnoustie, and he wadna hae a nasay but we wud come
an' hae a cup o' tea wi' him.  "An' if you'll bide a' nicht," he said, "we'll be awfu' pleased.
An' I'll chain up the denner bell i' the dog's cooch juist for that nicht."

Ay, weel! it's fine lauchin' noo when it's a' ower.  But if you'd been in my place, you wudna
lauchen muckle, I'se warrant.

IV.

A TALK ABOUT HEAVEN.

Sandy got a terrible dose o' the cauld lest week.  I never hardly saw him so bad.  He was ootbye
at the plooin' match lest Wedensday, an' he's hardly ever been ootower the door sin' syne.
There was a nesty plook cam' oot juist abune his lug on Setarday, an' he cudna get on his lum
hat; so he had to bide at hame a' Sabbath, an' he spent the feck o' the day i' the hoose readin'
Tammas Boston's "Power-fold State" an' the "Pilgrim's Progress."  Ye see, Sandy's a bit o'
a theologian aye when he's onweel.  If he's keepit i' the hoose wi' a host or a sair heid,
Sandy juist tak's a dose o' medicin', an' starts to wirry awa' at Bunyan or the Bible.  He's
a queer cratur that wey, for as halikit a character as he is.

But we had a kind o' a kirk o' oor ain on Sabbath i' the forenicht, for Dauvid Kenawee cam'
in, an' syne Bandy Wobster; an' they werena weel set doon when in cam' Jacob Teylor, the smith,
an' Stumpie Mertin alang wi' them.  Gairner Winton cam' in to speer what had come ower Sandy,
for he hadna seen him at the kirk.  Ye never saw sic a hoosefu'!  Sandy was sittin' at the
fireside wi' an auld greatcoat an' a hairy bonnet on, an' a' the sax o' them fell to the crackin',
ye never heard the like.  Ye wudda really thocht it was a meetin' o' the Presbitree--they were
a' speaking that throwither.

"An' what was the minister on the nicht, Gairner?" I says, says I, juist to stop them yabblin'
aboot politicks, an' a' the like o' that nonsense on Sabbath nicht.

"He had twa texts the nicht, Bawbie," said the Gairner.  "He took the wirds in Second Kings,
second an' elevent, an' in Luke, nint an' thirtieth, an' a fine discoorse he made o't, aboot
Elijah bein' taen up to heaven in the fiery chariot, an' comin' again a hunder or a thoosand
'ear efter, juist the same billie as he gaed awa'.  He made oot that we'd meet a' oor deid
freends in heaven again, an' juist ken them the same as though they'd only been awa' frae hame
for a cheenge for a while."

"I dinna haud wi' yon view o' the thing ava," said Bandy Wobster.  "He wud hae's a' believe
that fowk never grow a bit aulder in heaven.  The thing appears to me to be ridic'lous.  Elijah,
a thoosand 'ear efter he was taen up, cam' back withoot being a bit cheenged ether ae wey or
anither; that was his idea o't."

"It's a gey ticklish subjeck," put in the Smith; "but, faigs, lads, I haud wi' the minister."

He's an awtu' nice, cowshis man the Smith.  Ye wud sometimes think he was meent for a minister,
he says things that clever; an' a body aye feels the better efter a crack wi' him.

"Ye see," he gaed on, "I wadna like it to be ony ither wey.  Ye mind o' my little Elsie?  Puir
lassie, it's--lat me see; ay, it's twal' 'ear come Mertimas sin' she was taen awa'.  Ay, man;
an' she taen mair o' my heart wi' her in her bit coffinie than she left ahent her.  A bonnie
bit lassie she was, Bawbie, as ye'll mind.  She was juist seven past when she was taen awa';
an' when I meet her again, I wud like her to be juist the same bonnie bit lassokie that cam'
in wi' her pawlie that Setarday efternune an' tell'd me she had a sair heid--the henmist sair
heid ever she was genna hae.  Ye see, lads, if Elsie was growin' aulder in heaven, she wud
be a woman nearhand twenty gin this time, an' she wudna be the same to me ava."  An' the Smith
lookit into the heart o' the fire like's he had tint something; an' I saw his een fill.

"That's the minister's wey o' lookin' at the thing too, I think," said the Gairner; "but I
canna juist fathom't, I maun admit."

"There's something in what the Smith says," said Bandy; "but if there's to be nae growin' ony
aulder i' the next world, there'll be some fowk 'ill hae a gey trauchle.  There was Mysie Wilkie's
bairn that de'ed doon there i' the Loan a fortnicht syne.  It was a puir wammily-lookin' cratur,
an' was only but aucht days auld when it took bruntkadis an' closed, juist in an 'oor or twa.
Mysie, puir cratur, never kent.  She was brainish a' the time, an' she follow'd her bairnie
twa days efter. D'ye mean to tell me that Mysie 'ill be dwanged trailin' throo a' eternity
wi' a bit bairnie aucht days auld, an' it never gettin' even the lenth o' bein' doakit, lat
aleen growin' up to be able to tak' care o'ts sel?  The thing's no rizzenable."
