THE FIRST WIFE

The dead woman had lain six years in her grave, and the new wife had reigned five of them in
her stead. Her triumph over her dead rival was well-nigh complete. She had nearly ousted her
memory from her husband's heart. She had given him an heir for his name and estate, and, lest
the bonny boy should fail, there was a little brother creeping on the nursery floor, and another
child stirring beneath her heart. The twisted yew before the door, which was heavily buttressed
because the legend ran that when it died the family should die out with it, had taken another
lease of life, and sent out one spring green shoots on boughs long barren. The old servants
had well-nigh forgotten the pale mistress who reigned one short year; and in the fishing village
the lavish benefactions of the reigning lady had quite extinguished the memory of the tender
voice and gentle words of the woman whose place she filled. A new era of prosperity had come
to the Island and the race that long had ruled it.

Under a high, stately window of the ruined Abbey was the dead wife's grave. In the year of
his bereavement, before the beautiful brilliant cousin of his dead Alison came and seized on
his life, the widower had spent days and nights of stony despair standing by her grave. She
had died to give him an heir to his name, and her sacrifice had been vain, for the boy came
into the world dead, and lay on her breast in the coffin. Now for years he had not visited
the place: the last wreaths of his mourning for her had been washed into earth and dust long
ago, and the grave was neglected. The fisherwives whispered that a despairing widower is soonest
comforted; and in that haunted Island of ghosts and omens there were those who said that they
had met the dead woman gliding at night along the quay under the Abbey walls, with the shape
of a child gathered within her shadowy arms. People avoided the quay at night therefore, and
no tale of the ghost ever came to the ears of Alison's husband.

His new wife held him indeed in close keeping. In the first days of his remarriage the servants
in the house had whispered that there had been ill blood over the man between the two women,
so strenuously did the second wife labour to uproot any trace of the first. The cradle that
had been prepared for the young heir was flung to a fishergirl expecting her base-born baby:
the small garments into which Alison had sewn her tears with the stitches went the same road.
There was many an honest wife might have had the things, but that would not have pleased the
grim humour of the second wife towards the woman she had supplanted.

Everything that had been Alison's was destroyed or hidden away. Her rooms were changed out
of all memory of her. There was nothing, nothing in the house to recall to her widower her
gentleness, or her face as he had last seen it, snow-pale and pure between the long ashen-fair
strands of her hair. He never came upon anything that could give him a tender stab with the
thought of her. So she was forgotten, and the man was happy with his children and his beautiful
passionate wife, and the constant tenderness with which she surrounded every hour of his life.

Little by little she had won over all who had cause to love the dead woman,--all human creatures,
that is to say: a dog was more faithful and had resisted her. Alison's dog was a terrier, old,
shaggy and blear-eyed: he had been young with his dead mistress, and had seemed to grow old
when she died. He had fretted incessantly during that year of her husband's widowhood, whimpering
and moaning about the house like a distraught creature, and following the man in a heavy melancholy
when he made his pilgrimages to the grave. He continued those pilgrimages after the man had
forgotten, but the heavy iron gate of the Abbey clanged in his face, and since he could not
reach the grave his visits grew fewer and fewer. But he had not forgotten.

The new mistress had put out all her fascinations to win the dog too, for it seemed that while
any living creature clung to the dead woman's memory her triumph was not complete. But the
dog, amenable to every one else, was savage to her. All her soft overtures were received with
snarling, and an uncovering of the strong white teeth that was dangerous. The woman was not
without a heart, except for the dead, and the misery of the dog moved her--his restlessness,
his whining, the channels that tears had worn under his faithful eyes. She would have liked
to take him up in her arms and comfort him; but once when her pity moved her to attempt it,
the dog ran at her ravening. The husband cried out: 'Has he hurt you, my Love?' and was for
stringing him up. But some compunction stirred in her, and she saved him from the rope, though
she made no more attempts to conciliate him.

After that the dog disappeared from the warm living-rooms, where he had been used to stretch
on the rug before the leaping wood-fires. It was a cold and stormy autumn, with many shipwrecks,
and mourning in the village for drowned husbands and sons, whose little fishing boats had been
sucked into the boiling surges. The roar of the wind and the roar of the waves made a perpetual
tumult in the air, and the creaking and lashing of the forest trees aided the wild confusion.
There were nights when the crested battalions of the waves stormed the hill-sides and foamed
over the Abbey graves, and weltered about the hearthstones of the high-perched fishing village.
When there was not storm there was bitter black frost.

The old house had attics in the gables, seldom visited. You went up from the inhabited portions
by a corkscrew staircase, steep as a ladder. The servants did not like the attics. There were
creaking footsteps on the floors at night, and sometimes the slamming of a door or the stealthy
opening of a window. They complained that locked doors up there flew open, and bolted windows
were found unbolted. In storm the wind keened like a banshee, and one bright snowy morning
a housemaid, who had business there, found a slender wet footprint on the floor as of some
one who had come barefoot through the snow;--and fled down shrieking.

In one of the attics stood a great hasped chest, wherein the dead woman's dresses were mouldering.
The chest was locked, and was likely to remain so for long, for the new mistress had flung
away the key. From the high attic windows there was a glorious view of sea and land, of the
red sandstone valleys where the deer were feeding, of the black tossing woods, of the roan
bulls grazing quietly in the park, and far beyond, of the sea, and the fishing fleet, and in
the distance the smoke of a passing steamer. But none observed that view. There was not a servant
in the house who would lean from the casement without expecting the touch of a clay-cold finger
on her shoulder. Any whose business brought them to the attic looked in the corners warily,
while they stayed, but the servants did not like to go there alone. He went to her statehouse,
and to senate, and asked to see a Senator to Bryant. The short, gray-bearded man was pointed out
to him. Mr. dana looked for she had for the minutes and deeply said himself to himself, "t has

 Here and there an
old man or woman will remember to have seen him and will describe him--tall despite his great
age, with the frost on his head but never in his heart, stepping down the cobbles of the village
street leaning on his gold-headed cane, and greeting his spiritual children with such a courtesy
as had once been well in place at Versailles or the Little Trianon. Plainly he never ceased
to be the finest of fine gentlemen, though a less inbred courtesy might well rust in the isolation
of thirty years. Yet he seems to have been no less the humblest and simplest of priests. Old
Peter Devine will tell you his childish memory of the old priest sitting by the turf fire in
the fisherman's cottage, listening to the eternal complaint of the winds and waters that had
destroyed the fishing and washed the potato-gardens out to sea, and pausing in his words of
counsel and sympathy to take delicately a pinch of the finest snuff, snuff that had never bemeaned
itself by paying duty to King George.

But that was in the quite peaceful days, when the country over there beyond the shallow water
lay in the apathy of exhaustion--helpless and hopeless. That was years after Father Anthony
had flashed out as a man of war in the midst of his quiet pastoral days, and like any Old Testament
hero had taken the sword and smitten his enemies in the name of the Lord.

Father Anthony was the grandson of one of those Irish soldiers of fortune who, after the downfall
of the Jacobite cause in Ireland, had taken service in the French and Austrian armies. In Ireland
they called them the Wild Geese. He had risen to high honours in the armies of King Louis,
and had been wounded at Malplaquet. The son followed in his father's footsteps and was among
the slain at Fontenoy. Father Anthony, too, became a soldier and saw service at Minden, and
carried away from it a wound in the thigh which made necessary the use of that gold-headed
cane. They said that, soldier as he was, he was a fine courtier in his day. One could well
believe it looking at him in his old age. From his father he had inherited the dashing bravery
and gay wit of which even yet he carried traces. From his French mother he had the delicate
courtesy and finesse which would be well in place in the atmosphere of a court.

However, in full prime of manhood and reputation, Father Anthony, for some reason or other,
shook the dust of courts off his feet, and became a humble aspirant after the priesthood at
the missionary College of St. Omer. He had always a great desire to be sent to the land of
his fathers, the land of faith and hope, of which he had heard from many an Irish refugee,
and in due time his desire was fulfilled. He reached the Island one wintry day, flung up out
of the teeth of storms, and was in the Island thirty years, till the reveille of his Master
called him to the muster of the Heavenly host.

Father Anthony seems to have been innocently ready to talk over his days of fighting. He was
not at all averse from fighting his battles over again for these simple children of his who
were every day in battle with the elements and death. Peter Devine remembers to have squatted,
burning his shins by the turf fire, and watching with fascination the lines in the ashes which
represented the entrenchments and the guns, and the troops of King Frederick and the French
line, as Father Anthony played the war-game for old Corney Devine, whose grass-grown grave
is under the gable of the Island Chapel.

Now and again a fisherman was admitted by special favour to look upon the magnificent clothing
which Father Anthony had worn as a colonel of French Horse. The things were laid by in lavender
as a bride might keep her wedding-dress. There were the gold-laced coat and the breeches with
the sword-slash in them, the sash, the belt, the plumed hat, the high boots, the pistols, and
glittering among them all, the sword. That chest of Father Anthony's and its contents were
something of a fairy tale to the boys of the Island, and each of them dreamt of a day when
he too might behold them. The chest, securely locked and clamped, stood in the sacristy; and
Father Anthony would have seen nothing incongruous in its neighbourhood to the sacred vessels
and vestments. He generally displayed the things when he had been talking over old fighting
days, to the Island men mostly, but occasionally to a French captain, who with a cargo, often
contraband, or wines and cigars, would run into the Island harbour for shelter. Then there
were courtesies given and exchanged; and Father Anthony's guest at parting would make an offering
of light wines, much of which found its way to sick and infirm Island men and women in the
days that followed.

Father Anthony had been many placid years on the Island when there began to be rumours of trouble
on the mainland. Just at first the United Irish Society had been quite the fashion, and held
no more rebellious than the great volunteer movement of a dozen years earlier. But as time
went by things became more serious. Moderate and fearful men fell away from the Society, and
the union between Northern Protestants and Southern Catholics, which had been a matter of much
concern to the Government of the day, was met by a policy of goading the leaders on to rebellion.
By and by this and that idol of the populace was flung into prison. Wolfe Tone was in France,
praying, storming, commanding, forcing an expedition to act in unison with a rising on Irish
soil. Father Anthony was excited in these days. The France of the Republic was not his France,
and the stain of the blood of the Lord's Anointed was upon her, but for all that the news of
the expedition from Brest set his blood coursing so rapidly and his pulses beating, that he
was fain to calm with much praying the old turbulent spirit of war which possessed him.

Many of the young fishermen had left the Island and were on the mainland, drilling in secrecy.
There were few left save old men and women and children when the blow fell. The Government,
abundantly informed of what went on in the councils of the United Irishmen, knew the moment
to strike, and took it. The rebellion broke out in various parts of the country, but already
the leaders were in prison. Calamity followed calamity. Heroic courage availed nothing. In
a short time Wolfe Tone lay dead in the Provost-Marshal's prison of Dublin; and Lord Edward
Fitzgerald was dying of his wounds. In Dublin, dragoonings, hangings, pitch-capping and flogging
set up a reign of terror. Out of the first sudden silence terrible tidings came to the Island.

At that time there was no communication with the mainland except by the fishermen's boats or
at low water. The Island was very much out of the world; and the echoes of what went on in
the world came vaguely as from a distance to the ears of the Island people. They were like
enough to be safe, though there was blood and fire and torture on the mainland. They were all
old and helpless people, and they might well be safe from the soldiery. There was no yeomanry
corps within many miles of the Island, and it was the yeomanry, tales of whose doings made
the Islanders' blood run cold. Not the foreign soldiers--oh no, they were often merciful, and
found this kind of warfare bitterly distasteful. But it might well be that the yeomanry, being
so busy, would never think of the Island.

Father Anthony prayed that it might be so, and the elements conspired to help him. There were
many storms and high tides that set the Island riding in safety. Father Anthony went up and
down comforting those whose husbands, sons, and brothers were in the Inferno over yonder. The
roses in his old cheeks withered, and his blue eyes were faded with many tears for his country
and his people. He prayed incessantly that the agony of the land might cease, and that his
own most helpless flock might be protected from the butchery that had been the fate of many
as innocent and helpless.

The little church of gray stone stands as the vanguard of the village, a little nearer to the
mainland, and the spit of sand that runs out towards it. You ascend to it by a hill, and a
wide stretch of green sward lies before the door. The gray stone presbytery joins the church
and communicates with it. A ragged boreen, or bit of lane, between rough stone walls runs zigzag
from the gate, ever open, that leads to the church, and wanders away to the left to the village
on the rocks above the sea. Everything is just the same to-day as on that morning when Father
Anthony, looking across to the mainland from the high gable window of his bedroom, saw on the
sands something that made him dash the tears from his old eyes, and go hastily in search of
the telescope which had been a present from one of those wandering sea-captains.

As he set his glass to his eye that morning, the lassitude of age and grief seemed to have
left him. For a few minutes he gazed at the objects crossing the sands--for it was low water--in
an attitude tense and eager. At last he lowered the glass and closed it. He had seen enough.
Four yeomen on their horses were crossing to the island.

He was alone in the house, and as he bustled downstairs and made door and windows fast, he
was rejoiced it should be so. Down below the village was calm and quiet. The morning had a
touch of spring, and the water was lazily lapping against the sands. The people were within
doors,--of that he was pretty well assured--for the Island was in a state of terror and depression.
There was no sign of life down there except now and again the barking of a dog or the cackling
of a hen. Unconsciously the little homes waited the death and outrage that were coming to them
as fast as four strong horses could carry them. 'Strengthen thou mine arm,' cried Father Anthony
aloud, 'that the wicked prevail not! Keep thou thy sheep that thou hast confided to my keeping.
Lo! the wolves are upon them!' and as he spoke his voice rang out through the silent house.
The fire of battle was in his eyes, his nostrils smelt blood, and the man seemed exalted beyond
his natural size. Father Anthony went swiftly and barred his church doors, and then turned
into the presbytery. He flashed his sword till it caught the light and gleamed and glanced.
'For this, for this hour, friend,' he said, 'I have polished thee and kept thee keen. Hail,
sword of the justice of God!'

There came a thundering at the oaken door of the church. 'Open, son of Belial!' cried a coarse
voice, and then there followed a shower of blasphemies. The men had lit down from their horses,
which they had picketed below, and had come on foot, vomiting oaths, to the church door. Father
Anthony took down the fastenings one by one. Before he removed the last he looked towards the
little altar. 'Now,' he said, 'defend Thyself, all-powerful!' and saying, he let the bar fall.

The door swung open so suddenly that three of the men fell back. The fourth, who had been calling
his blasphemies through the keyhole of the door, remained yet on his knees. In the doorway,
where they had looked to find an infirm old man, stood a French colonel in his battle array,
the gleaming sword in his hand. The apparition was so sudden, so unexpected, that they stood
for the moment terror-stricken. Did they think it something supernatural? as well they might,
for to their astonished eyes the splendid martial figure seemed to grow and grow, and fill
the doorway. Or perhaps they thought they had fallen in an ambush.

Before they could recover, the sword swung in air, and the head of the fellow kneeling rolled
on the threshold of the church. The others turned and fled. One man fell, the others with a
curse stumbled over him, recovered themselves, and sped on. Father Anthony, as you might spit
a cockroach with a long pin, drove his sword in the fallen man's back and left it quivering.
The dying scream rang in his ears as he drew his pistols. He muttered to himself: 'If one be
spared he win return with seven worse devils. No! they must die that the innocent may go safe,'
and on the track of the flying wretches, he shot one in the head as he ran, and the other he
pierced, as he would have dragged himself into the stirrups.

In the broad sunlight, the villagers, alarmed by the sound of shooting, came timidly creeping
towards the presbytery to see if harm had befallen the priest, and found Father Anthony standing
on the bloody green sward wiping his sword and looking about him at the dead men. The fury
of battle had gone out of his face, and he looked gentle as ever, but greatly troubled. 'It
had to be,' he said, 'though, God knows, I would have spared them to repent of their sins.'

'Take them,' he said, 'to the Devil's Chimney and drop them down, so that if their comrades
come seeking them there may be no trace of them.' The Devil's Chimney is a strange, natural
oubliette of the Island, whose depth none has fathomed, though far below you may hear a subterranean
waterfall roaring.

One of the dead men's horses set up a frightened whinnying. 'But the poor beasts,' said Father
Anthony, who had ever a kindness for animals, 'they must want for nothing. Stable them in M'Ora's
Cave till the trouble goes by, and see that they are well fed and watered.'

An hour later, except for some disturbance of the grass, you would have come upon no trace
of these happenings. I have never heard that they cast any shade upon Father Anthony's spirit,
or that he was less serene and cheerful when peace had come back than he had been before. No
hue and cry after the dead yeomen ever came to the Island, and the troubles of '98 spent themselves
without crossing again from the mainland. After a time, when peace was restored, the yeomen's
horses were used for drawing the Island fish to the market, or for carrying loads of seaweed
to the potatoes, and many other purposes for which human labour had hitherto served.

But Father Anthony O'Toole was dead many and many a year before that tablet was set up to his
memory. And the strange thing was that Mr. Hill, the rector, who, having no flock to speak
of, is pretty free to devote himself to the antiquities of the Island, his favourite study,
was a prime mover in this commemoration of Father Anthony O'Toole, and himself selected the
text to go upon the tablet.

In a certain Wicklow country-house an O'Toole of this day will display to you, as they display
the dead hand of a martyr in a reliquary, the uniform, the sword and pistols, the feathered
hat and the riding boots, of Father Anthony O'Toole.

III

THE UNLAWFUL MOTHER

In the Island the standard of purity is an extraordinarily high one, and it is almost unheard
of that a woman should fall away from it. Purity is the unquestioned prerogative of every Island
girl or woman, and it only comes to them as a vague far-off horror in an unknown world that
there are places under the sun and the stars where such is not the case. The punishment is
appalling in the very few cases where sin has lifted its head amongst these austere people.
The lepers' hut of old was no such living death of isolation as surrounds an Island girl who
has smirched her good name. Henceforth there is an atmosphere about her that never lifts--of
horror for some, of tragedy for others, according to their temperament. There she stands lonely
for all her days, with the seal set upon her that can never be broken, the consecration of
an awful and tragic destiny.

I knew of such an one who was little more than a child when this horror befell her. She has
dark blue eyes and thick black lashes, and very white skin. The soft dark hair comes low on
her white forehead. With a gaily-coloured shawl covering her head, and drawn across her chin,
as they wear it in the Island, she looks, or looked when I last saw her, a hidden, gliding
image of modesty. And despite that sin of the past she is modest. It was the ignorant sin of
a child, and out of the days of horror and wrath that followed--her purging--she brought only
the maternity that burns like a white flame in her. The virtuous were more wroth against her
in old days that she carried her maternity so proudly. Why, not the most honourable and cherished
of the young Island mothers dandled her child with such pride. No mother of a young earl could
have stepped lighter, and held her head higher, than Maggie when she came down the fishing
street, spurning the very stones, as it seemed, so lightly she went with the baby wrapped in
her shawl. She did not seem to notice that some of the kindly neighbours stepped aside, or
that here and there a woman pulled her little daughter within doors, out of the path of the
unlawful mother. Those little pink fingers pushed away shame and contempt. The child was her world.

She was the daughter of a fisherman who died of a chest complaint soon after she was born.
Her mother still lives, a hard-featured honest old woman, with a network of fine lines about
her puckered eyes. Her hair went quite white the year her daughter's child was born, but I
remember it dark and abundant with only a silver thread glistening here and there. She has
grown taciturn too; she was talkative enough in the old days when I was a child in the Island,
and, often and often, came clattering in by the half-door to shelter from a shower, and sat
till fine weather on a stool by the turf ashes, gravely discussing the fishing and the prospects
of pigs and young fowl that season.

There are three sons, but Jim was married and doing for himself before the trouble befell the
family. Tom and Larry were at home, Tom, gentle and slow-spoken, employed about the Hall gardens.
Larry, a fisherman like his father before him. Both were deeply attached to their young sister,
and had been used to pet and care for her from her cradle.

There is yet a tradition in the island of that terrible time when Maggie's mother realised
the disgrace her daughter had brought on an honest name. There had been a horrified whisper
in the Island for some time before, a surmise daily growing more certain, an awe-stricken compassion
for the honest people who never suspected the ghastly shadow about to cross their threshold.
People had been slow to accept this solution of Maggie's pining and weakness. This one had
suggested herb-tea, and that one had offered to accompany Maggie to see the dispensary doctor
who came over from Breagh every Tuesday. But Maggie accepted none of their offices, only withdrew
herself more and more in a sick horror of herself and life, and roamed about the cliffs where
but the gulls and the little wild Island cattle looked on at her restless misery.

Her mother was half-fretted and half impatient of her daughter's ailing. She was a very strong
woman herself, and except for a pain in the side which had troubled her of late, she had never
known a day of megrims. She listened chafing to the neighbours' advice--and every one of them
had their nostrum--and heeded none of them. She had an idea herself that the girl's sickness
was imaginary and could be thrown off if she willed it. When the neighbours all at once ceased
offering her advice and sympathy she felt it a distinct relief. She had not the remotest idea
that she was become the centre of an awe-stricken sympathy, that her little world had fallen
back and stood gaping at her and hers as they might at one abnormally stricken: if their gabble
ceased very suddenly and no more idlers came in for a chat by the fireside she was not the
one to fret; she had always plenty to do without idle women hindering her, and, now the girl
had her sick fit on her, all the work fell to the mother's share.

The girl's time was upon her before the mother guessed at the blinding and awful truth. She
was a proud, stern, old woman, come of a race strong in rectitude, and she would scarcely have
believed an angel if one had come to testify to her daughter's dishonour. But the time came
when it could no longer be hidden, when the birth-pains were on the wretched girl, and in the
quietness of the winter night, her sin stood forth revealed.

Some merciful paralysis stiffened the mother's lips when she would have cursed her daughter.
She lifted up her voice indeed to curse, but it went from her; her lips jabbered helplessly;
over her face came a bluish-gray shade, and she fell in a chair huddled with one hand pressed
against her side.

The two men came in on this ghastly scene. The girl was crouched on the floor with her face
hidden, shrinking to the earth from the terrible words she expected to hear. The men lifted
the sister to her bed in the little room. They forced some spirit between their mother's lips,
and in a few minutes the livid dark shade began to pass from her face. Her lips moved. 'Take
her,' she panted, 'take that girl and her shame from my honest house, lest I curse her.'

The two men looked at each other. They turned pale through their hardy brownness, and then
flushed darkly red. It flashed on them in an instant. This was the meaning of the girl's sickness,
of a thousand hints they had not understood. Tom, with characteristic patience, was the first
to bend his back to the burden.

'Whisht, mother,' he said, 'whisht. Don't talk about cursing. If there's one black sin under
our roof-tree, we won't open the door to another.' He put his arm round her in a tender way.
'Come, achora,' he said, as if he were humouring a child, 'come and lie down. You're not well,
you creature.'

'Oh Tom,' said the mother, softening all at once, 'the black shame's on me, and I'll never
be well again in this world.'

She let him lift her to her bed in one of the little rooms that went off the kitchen. Then
he came back to where Larry stood, with an acute misery on his young face, looking restlessly
from the turf sods he was kicking now and again to the door behind which their young sister
lay in agony.

'There's no help for it, Larry,' said Tom, touching him on the shoulder. 'We can't trust her
and the mother under one roof. We must take her to the hospital. It's low water to-night, and
you can get the ass-cart across the sand. You'll take her, Larry, an' I'll stay an' see to
the mother.'

They wrapped the girl in all the bedclothes they could find and lifted her into the little
cart full of straw. The Island lay quiet under the moon, all white with snow except where a
black patch showed a ravine or cleft in the rocks. In the fishing village the doors were shut
and the bits of curtains drawn. It was bitterly cold, and not a night for any one to be abroad.
The ass-cart went quietly over the snow. The two men walked by it, never speaking; a low moaning
came from the woman in the cart. They did not meet a soul on their way to the shore.

At that point the Island sends out a long tongue of rock and sand towards the mainland. At
very low water there is but a shallow pool between the two shores; over this they crossed.
Sometimes the ass-cart stuck fast in the sand. Then the men lifted the wheels gently, so as
not to jerk the cart, and then encouraging the little ass, they went on again. When they had
climbed up the rocky shore to the mainland, and the cart was on the level road, they parted.
Before Tom turned his face homewards he bent down to Maggie. 'You're goin' where you'll be
taken care of, acushla. Don't fret; Larry'll fetch you home as soon as you can travel,' he
said. And then, as if he could scarcely bear the sight of her drawn face in the moonlight,
he turned abruptly, and went striding down the rocky shore to the strand.

Because Tom and Larry had forgiven out of their great love, it did not therefore follow that
the shame did not lie heavily on them. Tom went with so sad a face and so lagging a step that
people's hearts ached for him; while young Larry, who was always bright and merry, avoided
all the old friends, and when suddenly accosted turned a deep painful red and refused to meet
the eyes that looked their sympathy at him.

A few weeks passed and it was time for the girl to leave the hospital. There had been long
and bitter wrangles--bitter at least on one side--between the mother and sons. She had sworn
at first that she would never live under the roof with the girl, but the lads returned her
always the same answer, 'If she goes we go too.' And by degrees their dogged persistence dulled
the old woman's fierce anger. Maggie came home, and the cradle was established beside the hearth.
At first the brothers had whispered together of righting her, but when she had answered them
a question--a dull welt of shame tingling on their cheeks and hers as though some one had cut
them with a whip--they knew it was useless. The man had gone to America some months before,
and was beyond the reach of their justice.

But the child throve as if it had the fairest right to be in the world, and was no little nameless
waif whose very existence was a shame. He was a beautiful boy, round and tender, with his mother's
dark-blue eyes, and the exquisite baby skin which is softer than any rose-leaf. From very early
days he crowed and chuckled and was a most cheerful baby. Left alone in his cradle he would
be quietly happy for hours; he slept a great deal, and only announced his waking from sleep
by a series of delighted chuckles, which brought his mother running to his side to hoist him
in her arms.

He must have been about a year old when I first saw him. Maggie intruded him on no one, though
people said that if any one admired her baby it made her their lover for life. I happened to
be in the Island for a while, and one evening on a solitary ramble round the cliffs I came
face to face with Maggie,--Maggie stepping high, and prettier than ever with that rapt glory
of maternity in her face which made ordinary prettiness common beside her.

I saw by the way she wisped the shawl round her full white chin that I was welcome to pass
her if I would. But I did not pass her. I stopped and spoke a little on indifferent topics,
and then I asked for the baby. A radiant glow of pleasure swept over the young mother's healthily
pale face. She untwisted the shawl and lifted a fold of it, and stood looking down at the sleeping
child with a brooding tenderness, almost divine. He was indeed lovely, with the flush of sleep
upon him and one little dimpled hand thrust against her breast. 'What a great boy!' I said.
'But you must be half killed carrying him.' She laughed out joyfully, a sweet ringing laughter
like the music of bells. 'Deed then,' she said, ''tis the great load he is entirely, an' any
wan but meself 'ud be droppin' under the weight of him. But it 'ud be the quare day I'd complain
of my jewel. Sure it's the light heart he gives me makes him lie light in my arms.'

But Maggie's mother remained untouched by the child's beauty and winsomeness. Mother and daughter
lived in the same house absolutely without speech of each other. The girl was gentleness and
humility itself. For her own part she never forgot she was a sinner, though she would let no
one visit it on the child. I have been told that it was most pathetic to see how she strove
to win forgiveness from her mother, how she watched and waited on her month after month with
never a sign from the old woman, who was not as strong as she had been. The pain in her side
took her occasionally, and since any exertion brought it on she was fain at last to sit quietly
in the chimney-corner a good deal more than she had been used to. She had seen the doctor,
very much against her will, and he had said her heart was affected, but with care and avoiding
great excitement, it might last her to a good old age.

Maggie was glad of the hard work put upon her. She washed and swept and scrubbed and polished
all day long, with a touching little air of cheerfulness which never ceased to be sad unless
when she was crooning love-songs to the baby. She made no effort to take up her old friends
again, though she was so grateful when any one stopped and admired the baby. She quite realised
that her sin had set her apart, that nothing in all the world could give her back what she
had lost, and set her again by the side of those happy companions of her childhood.

As the time passed she never seemed to feel that her mother was hard and unrelenting. She bore
her dark looks and her silence with amazing patience. Usually the old woman seemed never to
notice the child; but once Maggie came in and saw her gazing at the sleeping face in the cradle
with what seemed to her a look of scorn and dislike. She gave a great cry, like the cry of
a wounded thing, and snatching the child, ran out with him bareheaded, carrying him away to
the high cliffs covered with flowers full of honey, and there she crooned and cried over him
till the soothing of the sweet wind and the sunshine eased her heart, and the blighting gaze
that had fallen upon her darling had left no shadow.

For her two brothers she felt and displayed a doglike devotion and gratitude. The big fellows
were sometimes almost uneasy under the love of her eyes, and the thousand and one offices she
was always doing for them to try to make up to them for her past. They had come to take an
intense interest, at first half shamefaced, in the baby. But as he grew older and full of winning
ways, one could not always remember that he was a child of shame, and he made just as much
sunshine as any lawful child makes in a house. More indeed, for in all the Island was never
so beautiful a child. The sun seemed to shed all its rays on his head; his eyes were blue as
the sea; his limbs were sturdy and beautiful, and from the time he began to take notice he
sent out little tendrils that gathered round the hearts of all those who looked upon him. So
kind is God sometimes to a little nameless child.

But to see Maggie while her brothers played with the boy, tossing him in their arms, and letting
him spring from one to the other, was indeed a pretty sight. You know the proud confidence
with which an animal that loves you looks on at your handling of her little ones--her anxiety
quite swallowed up in her pride and confidence and her benevolent satisfaction in the pleasure
she is giving you. That is how Maggie watched those delightful romps. But the old woman in
the chimney-corner turned away her head; and never forgot that Maggie had stolen God's gift,
and that the scarlet letter was on the boy's white forehead.

As the years passed and the boy throve and grew tall, I heard of Maggie becoming very devout.
'A true penitent,' said Father Tiernay to me, 'and I believe that in return for the patience
and gentleness with which she has striven to expiate her sin God has given her a very unusual
degree of sanctity.' In the intervals of her work she was permitted as a great privilege to
help about the altar linen, and keep the church clean. She used to carry the boy with her when
she went to the church, and I have come upon him fast asleep in a sheltered corner, while his
mother was sweeping and dusting, with a radiant and sanctified look on a face that had grown
very spiritual.

But still the old mother remained inexorable. I am sure in her own mind she resented as a profanation
her daughter's work about the church. She herself had never entered that familiar holy place
since her daughter's disgrace. Sunday and holiday all these years she had trudged to Breagh,
a long way round by the coast, for mass. All expostulations have been vain, even Father Tiernay's
own. Whatever other people may forget, the sin has lost nothing of its scarlet for her.

It was the last time I was on the Island that I was told of Maggie's marriage. Not to an Island
man: oh no, no Island man would marry a girl with a stain on her character, not though she
came to be as high in God's favour as the blessed Magdalen herself. He was the mate of a Scotch
vessel, a grave, steady, strong-faced Highlander. He had come to the Island trading for years,
and knew Maggie's story as well as any Islander. But he had seen beyond the mirk of the sin
the woman's soul pure as a pearl.

Maggie could not believe that any man, least of all a man like Alister, wanted to marry her.
'I am a wicked woman,' she said with hot blushes, 'and you must marry a good woman.'

'I mean to marry a good woman, my lass,' he said, 'the best woman I know. And that is your
bonny self.' Maggie hesitated. He smoothed back her hair with a fond proprietary touch. 'We'll
give the boy a name,' he said, 'and before God, none will ever know he's not my own boy.'

That settled it. Jack was a big lad of six now, and would soon begin to understand things,
and perhaps ask for his father. It opened before her like an incredible exquisite happiness
that perhaps he need never know her sin. She put her hand into Alister's and accepted him in
a passion of sobbing that was half joy, half sorrow.

The brothers were all in favour of the marriage. They loved her too much not to want her to
have a fair chance in a new life. Here on the Island, though she were a saint, she would still
be a penitent. It came hardest on Tom,--for Larry was soon to bring home a wife of his own,
but neither man talked much of what he felt. They put aside their personal sorrow and were
glad for Maggie and her boy.

But Maggie's mother was consistent to the last. No brazen and flaunting sinner could have seemed
to her more a lost creature than the girl who had been so dutiful a daughter, so loving a sister,
so perfect a mother, all those years. Tom told her the news. 'I wash my hands of her,' she
said. 'Let her take her shame under an honest man's roof if she will. I wish her neither joy
nor sorrow of it.' And more gentle words than these Tom could not bring her to say.

So Maggie was married, the old woman preserving her stony silence and apparent unconcern. She
only spoke once,--the day the girl was made a wife. It was one of her bad days, and she had
to lie down after an attack of her heart. Maggie dressed to go to the church and meet her bridegroom.
She was not to return to the cottage, and her modest little luggage and little Jack's were
already aboard the Glasgow brig. At the last, hoping for some sign of softening, the girl went
into the dim room where her mother lay, ashen-cheeked. The mother turned round on her her dim
eyes. 'What do you want of me?' she asked, breaking the silence of years. The girl helplessly
covered her eyes with her hands. 'Did you come for my blessing?' gasped the old woman. 'It
is liker my curse you'd take with you. But I promised Tom long ago that I would not curse you.
Go then. And I praise God that Larry will soon give me an honest daughter instead of you, my
shame this many a year.'

That was the last meeting of mother and daughter. They say Alister is a devoted husband, but
he comes no more to the Island. He has changed out of his old boat, and his late shipmates
say vaguely that he has removed somewhere Sunderland or Cardiff way, and trades to the North
Sea. Tom is very reticent about Maggie, though Miss Bell, the postmistress, might tell, if
she were not a superior person, and as used to keeping a secret at a pinch as Father Tiernay
himself, how many letters he receives with the post-mark of a well-known seaport town.

Poor Maggie! Said I not that in the Island the way of transgressors is hard?

IV

A RICH WOMAN

Margret Laffan was something of a mystery to the Island people. Long ago in comparative youth
she had disappeared for a half-dozen years. Then she had turned up one day in a coarse dress
of blue and white check, which looked suspiciously like workhouse or asylum garb, and had greeted
such of the neighbours as she knew with a nod, for all the world as if she had seen them yesterday.
It happened that the henwife at the Hall had been buried a day or two earlier, and when Margret
came asking a place from Mrs. Wilkinson, the lord's housekeeper, the position was yet unfilled
and Margret got it.

Not every one would have cared for the post. Only a misanthropic person indeed would have been
satisfied with it. The henwife's cottage and the poultry settlement might have been many miles
from a human habitation, so lonely were they. They were in a glen of red sandstone, and half
the wood lay between them and the Hall. The great red walls stood so high round the glen that
you could not even hear the sea calling. As for the village, it was a long way below. You had
to go down a steep path from the glen before you came to an open space, where you could see
the reek of the chimneys under you. Every morning Margret brought the eggs and the trussed
chickens to the Hall. But no one disturbed her solitude, except when the deer, or the wild
little red cattle came gazing curiously through the netting at Margret and her charges. There,
for twenty-seven years, Margret lived with no company but the fowl. On Sundays and holidays
she went to mass to the Island Chapel, but gave no encouragement to those who would have gone
a step of the road home with her. The Island women used to wonder how she could bear the loneliness.--'Why,
God be betune us and harm!' they often said, 'Sure the crathur might be robbed and murdhered
any night of the year and no wan the wiser.' And so she might, if the Island possessed robbers
and murderers in its midst. But it is a primitively innocent little community, which sleeps
with open doors as often as not, and there is nothing to tempt marauders or even beggars to
migrate there.

By and by a feeling got about that Margret must be saving money. Her wage as a henwife was
no great thing, but then, as they said, 'she looked as if she lived on the smell of an oil-rag,'
and there was plenty of food to be had in the Hall kitchen, where Margret waited with her eggs
and fowl every morning. Certainly her clothes, though decent, were worn well-nigh threadbare.
But the feelers that the neighbours sent out towards Margret met with no solid assurance. Grim
and taciturn, Margret kept her own counsel, and was like enough to keep it till the day of
her death.

Jack Laffan, Margret's brother, is the village carpenter, a sociable poor man, not the least
bit in the world like his sister. Jack is rather fond of idling over a glass with his cronies
in the public-house, but, as he is well under Mrs. Jack's thumb, the habit is not likely to
grow on him inconveniently. There are four daughters and a son, a lad of fifteen or thereabouts.
Two of the daughters are domestic servants out in the big world, and are reported to wear streamers
to their caps and fine lace aprons every day. Another is handmaiden to Miss Bell at the post
office, and knows the contents of all the letters, except Father Tiernay's, before the people
they belong to. Fanny is at home with her father and mother, and is supposed to be too fond
of fal-lals, pinchbeck brooches and cheap ribbons, which come to her from her sisters out in
the world. She often talks of emigration, and is not sought after by the young men of the Island,
who regard her as a 'vain paycocky thing.'

Mrs. Jack has the reputation of being a hard, managing woman. There was never much love lost
between her and Margret, and when the latter came back from her six years' absence on the mainland,
Mrs. Jack's were perhaps the most ill-natured surmises as to the reasons for Margret's silence
and the meaning of that queer checked garb.

For a quarter of a century Margret lived among her fowl, untroubled by her kin. Then the talk
about the money grew from little beginnings like a snowball. It fired Mrs. Jack with a curious
excitement, for she was an ignorant woman and ready to believe any extravagant story. She amazed
Jack by putting the blame of their long ignoring of Margret upon his shoulders entirely, and
when he stared at her, dumb-founded, she seized and shook him till his teeth rattled. 'You
great stupid omadhaun!' she hissed between the shakes, 'that couldn't have the nature in you
to see to your own sister, an' she a lone woman!'

That very day Jack went off stupidly to try to bridge over with Margret the gulf of nearly
thirty years. He got very little help from his sister. She watched him with what seemed like
grim enjoyment while he wriggled miserably on the edge of his chair and tried to talk naturally.
At length he jerked out his wife's invitation to have a bit of dinner with them on the coming
Sunday, which Margret accepted without showing any pleasure, and then he bolted.

Margret came to dinner on the Sunday, and was well entertained with a fat chicken and a bit
of bacon, for the Laffans were well-to-do people. She thoroughly enjoyed her dinner, though
she spoke little and that little monosyllabic; but Margret was taciturn even as a girl, and
her solitary habit for years seemed to have made speech more difficult for her. Mrs. Jack heaped
her plate with great heartiness and made quite an honoured guest of her. But outside enjoying
the dinner Margret did not seem to respond. Young Jack was brought forward to display his accomplishments,
which he did in the most hang-dog fashion. The cleverness and good-looks and goodness of the
girls were expatiated upon, but Margret gave no sign of interest. Once Fanny caught her looking
at her with a queer saturnine glance, that made her feel all at once hot and uncomfortable,
though she had felt pretty secure of her smartness before that. Margret's reception of Mrs.
Jack's overtures did not satisfy that enterprising lady. When she had departed Mrs. Jack put
her down as 'a flinty-hearted ould maid.' 'Her sort,' she declared, 'is ever an' always sour
an' bitther to them the Lord blesses wid a family.' But all the same it became a regular thing
for Margret to eat her Sunday dinner with the Laffans, and Mrs. Jack discovered after a time
that the good dinners were putting a skin and roundness on Margret that might give her a new
lease of life--perhaps a not quite desirable result.

The neighbours looked on at Mrs. Jack's 'antics' with something little short of scandal. They
met by twos and threes to talk over it, and came to the conclusion that Mrs. Jack had no shame
at all, at all, in her pursuit of the old woman's money. Truth to tell, there was scarcely
a woman in the Island but thought she had as good a right to Margret's money as her newly-attentive
kinsfolk. Mrs. Devine and Mrs. Cahill might agree in the morning, with many shakings of the
head, that 'Liza Laffan's avarice and greed were beyond measure loathsome. Yet neither seemed
pleased to see the other a little later in the day, when Mrs. Cahill climbing the hill with
a full basket met Mrs. Devine descending with an empty one.

For all of a sudden a pilgrimage to Margret's cottage in the Red Glen became the recognised
thing. It was surprising how old childish friendships and the most distant ties of kindred
were furbished up and brought into the light of day. The grass in the lane to the glen became
trampled to a regular track. If the women themselves did not come panting up the hill they
sent the little girsha, or wee Tommy or Larry, with a little fish, or a griddle cake, or a
few fresh greens for Margret. The men of the Island were somewhat scornful of these proceedings
on the part of their dames; but as a rule the Island wives hold their own and do pretty well
as they will. All this friendship for Margret created curious divisions and many enmities.

Margret, indeed, throve on all the good things, but whether any one person was in her favour
more than another it would be impossible to say. Margret got up a way of thanking all alike
in a honeyed voice that had a queer sound of mockery in it, and after a time some of the more
independent spirits dropped out of the chase, 'pitching,' as they expressed it, 'her ould money
to the divil.' Mrs. Jack was fairly confident all the time that if any one on the Island got
Margret's nest-egg it would be herself, but she had a misgiving which she imparted to her husband
that the whole might go to Father Tiernay for charities. Any attempt at getting inside the
shell which hid Margret's heart from the world her sister-in-law had long given up. She had
also given up trying to interest Margret in 'the childher,' or bidding young Jack be on his
best behaviour before the Sunday guest. The young folk didn't like the derision in Margret's
pale eyes, and kept out of her way as much as possible, since they feared their mother too
much to flout her openly, as they were often tempted to do.

Two or three years had passed before Margret showed signs of failing. Then at the end of one
very cold winter people noticed that she grew feebler. She was away from mass one or two Sundays,
and then one Sunday she reappeared walking with the aid of a stick and looking plainly ill
and weak. After mass she had a private talk with Father Tiernay at the presbytery; and then
went slowly down to Jack's house for the usual dinner. Both Jack and Mrs. Jack saw her home
in the afternoon, and a hard task the plucky old woman found it, for all their assistance,
to get back to her cottage up the steep hill. When they had reached the top she paused for
a rest. Then she said quietly, 'I'm thinkin' I'll make no more journeys to the Chapel. Father
Tiernay'll have to be coming to me instead.'

'Tut, tut, woman dear,' said Mrs. Jack, with two hard red spots coming into her cheeks, 'we'll
be seein' you about finely when the weather gets milder.' And then she insinuated in a wheedling
voice something about Margret's affairs being settled.

Margret looked up at her with a queer mirthfulness in her glance. 'Sure what wud a poor ould
woman like me have to settle? Sure that's what they say when a sthrong-farmer takes to dyin'.'

Mrs. Jack was too fearful of possible consequences to press the matter. She was anxious that
Margret should have Fanny to look after the house and the fowl for her, but this Margret refused.
'I'll be able to do for myself a little longer,' she said, 'an' thank you kindly all the same.'

When it was known that Margret was failing, the attentions to her became more urgent. Neighbours
passed each other now in the lane with a toss of the head and 'a wag of the tail.' As for Mrs.
Jack, who would fain have installed herself altogether in the henwife's cottage, she spent
her days quivering with indignation at the meddlesomeness of the other women. She woke Jack
up once in the night with a fiery declaration that she'd speak to Father Tiernay about the
pursuit of her moneyed relative, but Jack threw cold water on that scheme. 'Sure his Riverince
himself, small blame to him, 'ud be as glad as another to have the bit. 'Twould be buildin'
him the new schoolhouse he's wantin' this many a day, so it would.' And this suggestion made
Mrs. Jack look askance at her pastor, as being also in the running for the money.

It was surprising how many queer presents found their way to Margret's larder in those days.
They who had not the most suitable gift for an invalid brought what they had, and Margret received
them all with the same inscrutability. She might have been provisioning for a siege. Mrs. Jack's
chickens were flanked by a coarse bit of American bacon; here was a piece of salt ling, there
some potatoes in a sack; a slice of salt butter was side by side with a griddle cake. Many
a good woman appreciated the waste of good food even while she added to it, and sighed after
that full larder for the benefit of her man and the weans at home; but all the time there was
the dancing marsh-light of Margret's money luring the good souls on. There had never been any
organised robbery in the Island since the cattle-lifting of the kernes long ago; but many a
good woman fell of a tremble now when she thought of Margret and her 'stocking' alone through
the silent night, and at the mercy of midnight robbers.

There was not a day that several offerings were not laid at Margret's feet. But suddenly she
changed her stereotyped form of thanks to a mysterious utterance, 'You're maybe feeding more
than you know, kind neighbours,' was the dark saying that set the women conjecturing about
Margret's sanity.

Then the bolt fell. One day a big, angular, shambling girl, with Margret's suspicious eyes
and cynical mouth, crossed by the ferry to the Island. She had a trunk, which Barney Ryder,
general carrier to the Island, would have lifted to his ass-cart, but the new-comer scornfully
waved him away. 'Come here, you two gorsoons,' she said, seizing upon young Jack Laffan and
a comrade who were gazing at her grinning, 'take a hoult o' the thrunk an' lead the way to
Margret Laffan's in the Red Glen. I'll crack sixpence betune yez when I get there.' The lads,
full of curiosity, lifted up the trunk, and preceded her up the mile or so of hill to Margret's.
She stalked after them into the sunny kitchen where Margret sat waiting, handed them the sixpence
when they had put down the trunk, bundled them out and shut the door before she looked towards
Margret in her chimney-corner.

The explanation came first from his Reverence, who was walking in the evening glow, when Mrs.
Jack Laffan came flying towards him with her cap-strings streaming.

'Little Jack has a quare story, yer Riverince,' she cried out panting, 'about a girl's come
visitin' ould Margret in the glen, an' wid a thrunk as big as a house. Him an' little Martin
was kilt draggin' it up the hill.'

His Reverence waved away her excitement gently.

'I know all about it,' he said. 'Indeed I've been the means in a way of restoring Margret's
daughter to her. You never knew your sister-in-law was married, Mrs. Laffan? An odd woman to
drop her married name. We must call her by it in future. Mrs. Conneely is the name.'

But Mrs. Jack, with an emotion which even the presence of his Reverence could not quell, let
what the neighbours described afterwards as a 'screech out of her fit to wake the dead,' and
fled into her house, where on her bed she had an attack which came as near being hysterical
as the strong-minded woman could compass. She only recovered when Mrs. Devine and Mrs. Cahill
and the widow Mulvany, running in, proposed to drench her with cold water, when her heels suddenly
left off drumming and she stood up, very determinedly, and bade them be off about their own
business. She always spoke afterwards of Margret as the robber of the widow and orphan, which
was satisfying if not quite appropriate.

We all heard afterwards how Margret had married on the mainland, and after this girl was born
had had an attack of mania, for which she was placed in the county asylum. In time she was
declared cured, and it was arranged that her husband should come for her on a certain day and
remove her; but Margret, having had enough of marriage and its responsibilities, left the asylum
quietly before that day came and made her way to the Island. She had been well content to be
regarded as a spinster till she felt her health failing, and then she had entrusted to Father
Tiernay her secret, and he had found her daughter for her.

Margret lived some months after that, and left at the time of her death thirty pounds to the
fortunate heiress. The well-stocked larder had sufficed the two for quite a long time without
any recourse to 'the stocking.' There was very little further friendship between the village
and the Red Glen. Such of the neighbours as were led there at first by curiosity found the
door shut in their faces, for Mary had Margret's suspiciousness many times intensified. After
the Laffan family had recovered from the first shock of disappointment Fanny made various approaches
to her cousin when she met her at mass on the Sundays, and, unheeding rebuffs, sent her a brooch
and an apron at Christmas. I wish I could have seen Margret's face and Mary's over that present.
It was returned to poor Fanny, with a curt intimation that Mary had no use for it, and there
the matter ended.

I once asked Mary, when I knew her well enough to take the liberty, about that meeting between
her and her mother, after the door was shut on young Jack's and little Martin's departing footsteps.
'Well,' said Mary, 'she looked hard at me, an' then she said, "You've grown up yalla an' bad-lookin',
but a strong girl for the work. You favour meself, though I've a genteeler nose." And then,'
said Mary, 'I turned in an' boiled the kettle for the tay.'

The money did not even remain in the Island, for as soon as Margret was laid in a grave in
the Abbey--with a vacant space beside her, for, said Mary, 'you couldn't tell but I'd be takin'
a fancy to be buried there myself some day,'--Mary fled in the early morning before the neighbours
were about. Mary looked on the Island where so many had coveted her money as a 'nest of robbers,'
and so she fled, with 'the stocking' in the bosom of her gown, one morning at low tide. She
wouldn't trust the money to the post office in the Island, because her cousin Lizzie was Miss
Bell's servant. 'Divil a letther but the priest's they don't open an' read,' she said, 'an'
tells the news afterwards to the man or woman that owns it. The news gets to them before the
letter. An' if I put the fortune in there I'm doubtin' 'twould ever see London. I know an honest
man in the Whiterock post office I'd betther be trustin'.

And that is how Margret's 'stocking' left the Island.

HOW MARY CAME HOME

The Island people seldom marry outside the Island. They are passionately devoted to each other,
but as a rule look coldly upon the stranger. Swarthy Spanish sailors put in sometimes, and
fair-skinned, black-eyed Greeks, and broad-shouldered Norwegians, all as ripe for love as any
other sailor, but that they should carry away an Island girl to their outlandish places over
sea is a thing almost unheard of. 'this woman is a revolution, ever-the-days,'we state each lank, grumbling dyspeptic

MAURYEEN

Against Con Daly's little girl there was never a word spoken in the Island. Con had been well
liked, God rest his soul!--but the man was drowned nigh upon twenty years ago. There was some
old tragic tale about it, how he had volunteered to swim with a rope round his waist to a ship
breaking up a few yards from the rocks in a sea that a gannet could scarcely live upon. He
had pushed aside the men who remonstrated with him, turning on them a face ghastly in the moonlight.
'Stand aside, men,' he cried, 'and if I fail, see to the girsha!' He was the strongest man
in all the Island, and as much at home in the water as a porpoise. They saw his sleek head
now and again flung out of the trough of the waves, and his huge shoulders labouring against
the weight of the storm. Then suddenly the rope they were holding fell slack in their hands,--they
said afterwards it had snapped on a jagged razor of rock,--and the man disappeared. A day or
two later his battered and bruised body was flung up on the bathing strand, where in summer
the city ladies take their dip in the sea. He was buried with some of the drowned sailors he
had tried to rescue, and an iron cross put at his head by the fishermen. But for a long time
there was a talk that the man had gone to meet his death gladly, had for some reason or another
preferred death to life; but people were never quite sure if there was anything in it.

The Islanders had looked askance at Ellen Daly, Con's wife, before that, though to her husband
she was the apple of his eye. She had been a domestic servant on the mainland when Con Daly
met and married her, and she had never seemed to have any friends. She had been handsome in
her day, at least so some people thought, but there were women on the Island who said they
never could abide her, with her pale face and sneering smile, and her eyes that turned green
as a cat's when she was angry. However, she never tried to ingratiate herself with the women:
if the men admired her it was as much as she asked. When she liked she could be fascinating
enough. She bewitched Mrs. Wilkinson, the housekeeper at the Hall, into taking her on whenever
his Lordship filled the house with gentlemen and an extra hand was needed. She was deft and
clever, and could be insinuating when it served her purpose. But the friendship of the Island
women she had never desired, and when her husband was drowned there was not a fisher-wife to
go and sit with her in the desolate house. As the years went by her good looks went with them.
She yellowed, and her malevolent eyes took on red rims round their greenness; while her dry
lips, parted over her snarling teeth, were more ill than they had been when they were ripe
and ruddy.

The neighbours were kind by stealth to Con's girsha. Those were long days of her childhood
when her mother was at work in the Hall, and the child was locked in the empty cottage; but
many was the kind word through the window, from the women as they passed up and down, and now
and again a hot griddle-cake, or some little dainty of the kind, was passed through to the
child as she sat so dull and lonely on her little creepy stool.

Poor little Mauryeen! She was a child with social instincts, and often, often she used to wonder
in those lonely hours why she might not be out with the other children, playing at shop in
the crevices of the rocks, or wading for cockles, or dancing round in a ring to the sing-song
of 'Green Gravel,' or playing at 'High Gates.' Her mother coldly discouraged any friendship
with the children of her foes; and little Mauryeen grew up a silent child, with something more
delicate and refined about her than the other children,--with somehow the air of a little lady.

But Mauryeen was not her mother's child to be without a will of her own. As she grew from childhood
to girlhood she began to assert herself, and though her mother tried hard to break her spirit
she did not succeed. After a time she seemed to realise that here was something she had not
counted upon, and to submit, since she could not hope to fight it. All the same she hated the
girl whom she could not rule, hated her so furiously that the glitter of her eyes as she looked
at her from the chimney-corner was oftentimes murderous. For, little by little Mauryeen grew
to be friends with all the fishing village.

Even though she asserted herself the girl did her duty bravely and humbly. Any mother of them
all would have been proud to own Mauryeen. When her mother had employment at the Hall Mauryeen
took care of the house, and having cleaned and tidied to her heart's content, sat in the sun
at her knitting till Ellen Daly came home to find a comfortable meal prepared for her. The
woman's one good quality was that she had always been a good housewife, and the girl took after
her. Then when her mother was at home Mauryeen went out sewing to the houses of the few gentry
who lived on the hill; and the house was well kept and comfortable, though an unnatural hatred
sat beside the hearth.

The neighbours pitied and praised Mauryeen all the more. They used to wonder how long it would
last, the silent feud between mother and daughter, especially since Mauryeen was so capable
and clever that she might for the asking join even Mrs. Wilkinson's chosen band of handmaidens.

The girl meanwhile throve as happily as though she lived in the very sunshine of love rather
than in this malignant atmosphere. She saw little of her mother. The hours when they were under
one roof were few; and across the threshold she found abundant kindness and praise. Mauryeen
was small and graceful, with the olive-tinted fairness which had been her mother's in her best
days. But Mauryeen's blue eyes were kindly and her lips smiled, and her soft voice was gentle;
she had a pretty way of decking herself which the fisher-girls could never come by. Mauryeen
in a pink cotton frock, with a spray of brown seaweed in her belt, might have passed for one
of the young ladies who visited at the Hall. If the other girls copied her pretty tricks of
decoration they carried the tame air of the mere copyist. But no one grudged Mauryeen her charm;
she was so kind and gentle, and she had always the tragedy of that ghastly old mother of hers
to stir pity for her. Then too she always seemed so anxious that the other girls should look
well, and so willing to take trouble to this end, that no one could envy her her own prettiness.

There came a time when a young man of the Island, Randal Burke by name, declared to Mauryeen
that her voice could coax the birds off the trees, and that her head when she listened was
like the prettiest bird's head, all covered with golden feathers. She had indeed a very pretty
way of listening, with her head on one side and her eyes bright and attentive. Mauryeen was
used to compliments, and could usually hold her own in a bit of light love-making; but it was
remarkable that at this speech of Randal Burke's she went pale. She always turned pale when
another girl would have blushed.

Mauryeen's was a sudden and rapid wooing. The young fellow was fairly independent, possessing
as he did a little bit of land with his cottage, as well as a boat. His mother was one of the
most prosperous women of the Island, and had been in days gone by Ellen Daly's bitterest enemy.
But for all that she welcomed Mauryeen tenderly as a daughter.

There was a terrible to-do when Mauryeen told her mother of her intentions. She turned so livid
that Mauryeen for all her brave heart was frightened, and faltered. The old woman choked and
gasped with the whirlwind of passion that possessed her. As soon as she could speak she hissed
out:--

'The day you marry him I curse you, and him, your house, your marriage, and every child born
of you.'

Mauryeen's anger rose and shook her too like a whirlwind, but it drove out fear.

'And if you do, you wicked woman,' she said, 'it's not me it'll harm. Do you think God will
listen to the like of you or let harm befall me and mine because of your curse?'

For a day or two after Mauryeen's defiance her mother brooded in quietness, only now and again
turning on her daughter those terrible green eyes. No word passed between the two, and meanwhile
Randal Burke was hastening the preparations for the marriage by every means in his power. Father
Tiernay had 'called' them at the mass three Sunday mornings. The priest was greatly pleased
with the marriage. Mauryeen was a pet lamb of his flock, and he deeply disliked and distrusted
her mother.

It was the feast day of the year on the Island, a beautiful bright sunny June day. On a plateau
the men played at the hurley and putting the stone; and there was a tug of war for married
men and single, and after that for the women, amid much jollity and laughter. Above the plateau
the hill sloped, and that long sunny slope was the place from which the girls and women looked
on at the prowess of their male kind. That day out of all the year there was a general picnic
on the hill, and meals were eaten and the long day spent out of doors, till the dews came on
the grass.

Now one of the events was a rowing contest, and the course was right under the hill-slope.
Father Tiernay every year gave a money prize for the winner, and the distinction in itself
was ardently coveted. Randal Burke was rowing against another young fisherman, and it was not
easy to forecast the winner, both men were so strong, so practised, and so eager in the contest.

The race had begun, and the people on the hillside were standing up in their excitement watching
the boats, which were nearly dead level. Mauryeen stood by Randal's mother, with one hand thrust
childishly within her arm, and the other shading her eyes from the bright sun. Suddenly the
people were startled by the sound of running feet, and all looking in one direction they saw
Mauryeen's mother coming without bonnet or cloak, her face working with passion and her hands
clenched. The people fell back before her. She had an evil reputation, and for a minute or
two they thought she had gone mad. Mauryeen, who did not fall back with the others, found herself
standing in the centre of an empty space, while her mother panted before her, struggling for
words. All the women-folk behind pressed together and craned over each other's shoulders, half
alarmed and half curious.

At last the woman found her breath. She pointed a yellow finger at the girl, who stood before
her with her head proudly lifted, and her eyes amazed but fearless.

'Look at her,' shrieked the beldame, 'all of you, and you, Kate Burke, that boasts your family's
the oldest on the Island. Look well at her! Och, the good ould ancient blood! Look at her,
for her blood's ancienter still. Do you see anything of Con Daly in her?'

The girl looked round with a forlorn sense of being held up to public scorn, but the women
were huddling together, and the fear kept any one from coming to stand by her side.

'Look at her,' again shrieked the hoarse voice. 'D'yez know where she gets her pride and the
courage to dare me? She gets it from her father, th' ould lord. Con Daly had never act nor
part in her.'

A scream, the like of which the Island had never heard, broke from Mauryeen's lips. It was
such a cry as if body and soul were tearing asunder. With that scream she flung her arms above
her head. The little group, closing round her awe-stricken, looked to see her fall face downward
to the ground. But with a wild movement of her arms, as if she swept the whole world out of
her path, she fled down the hill towards the village. Ellen Daly had vanished. No one had seen
her go. And down in the dancing bay at their feet Randal Burke proudly shot ahead of his opponent
and won the race.

The girl meanwhile had fled on and on, with only the blind instinct to hide her disgrace. The
village was empty of all but the sick and the bed-ridden. There was not an eye on Mauryeen
Daly as she fled by the open doors. With a mechanical instinct she turned in at the door of
her mother's house. The cool darkness of it after the glare outside was grateful to her. She
closed the door and barred it. Then she turned into a room off the kitchen, her own little
room, where there was a picture of the Mother of Sorrows with seven swords through her heart,
and dropped on the floor before the picture with an inarticulate moaning.

She lay there half unconscious, and only feeling her misery dumbly. On the wall hung her blue
cashmere dress, in which she was to have been married a day or two later. On the chest of drawers
was a box containing the little wreath and veil her mother-in-law had presented her with. But
she saw none of these things, with her mouth and eyes against the floor.

She came back to life presently, hearing her name called. The voice had called many times before
she heard it. Now it was imperative, almost sharp in its eagerness. 'Open, acushla, open, or
I burst the door.' It was Randal's voice; and she answered it, advancing a step or two, groping
with outstretched hands, and a wild look of fear in her dilated eyes. Then she heard the door
straining and creaking, and a man panting, striving outside. In a little while, almost before
she had time to stand clear of it, the door rattled on the floor, and her lover leapt into
the cabin.

She put out her hands to fence him off, swaying blindly towards the wall. He sprang to her
with a murmur of pity, and was just in time to catch her as her senses left her, and she lay
a limp and helpless thing in his arms.

Father Tiernay was standing at his window gazing over a surpassingly fair plain of sea, dotted
with silver green islands. He was glad the people had so fine a day for their sports. In the
afternoon he would be with them to distribute the prizes and congratulate the winners, and
to add to the general enjoyment by his presence; but this morning he was alone, except for
his deaf old housekeeper, and Jim the sacristan, who was too dignified to be out on the Fair
Hill with the others. The priest's look of perplexity deepened as he watched some one climbing
the steep hill to his house. 'It looks like Cody's ghost carrying his wife's body,' he muttered
to himself. The figure or figures came nearer. At last his Reverence took in what he saw, and
made but one or two steps to the hall door. 'Come in here,' he said, asking no questions, like
a practical man; and indeed for a few minutes the young fisherman was incapable of answering
any. It was not until the priest had forced some brandy between the girl's lips, when they
had laid her on a sofa, and her breath came fluttering back, that Father Tiernay drew the lover
aside into the window recess and learnt in a few words what had happened.

'She's so proud, my little girl,' pleaded the lover. 'She won't live under the shame of it
unless your Reverence 'ud help us out of it. Couldn't your Reverence say the words over us?
We've been called three times, and I've the ring in my pocket. Oh, 'twas well that unnatural
woman calculated her time when our happiness was at the full. Couldn't your Reverence do it
for us?' he said again in a wheedling tone.

His Reverence looked at him thoughtfully. Then he drew out his watch. 'Yes,' he said, 'there's
time enough, and I think you're right, my lad. Just step outside while I speak to her, for
I see she's coming to.'

The young man whispered: 'God bless you, Father! If I waited till to-morrow I'd never put the
ring on her. I know the pride of her.' And then he went out obediently.

No one knew how Father Tiernay persuaded Mauryeen. But a little while later a very pale bride
stood up at the altar of Columb Island Chapel, and was married, with Father Tiernay's housekeeper
and the sacristan for witnesses.

When they were married Father Tiernay said to the bridegroom: 'Take her home by the back road.
You won't meet a soul, and I'll tell the people when I join them what has been done. But above
all, impress on her that the story is a wicked lie.'

So Mauryeen went home with her husband to his little cottage on the cliffs. And in the afternoon,
when Father Tiernay came to distribute the prizes and to merry-make with his people, he raised
his hand for silence and addressed them.

'Children,' he said, 'I hear there has been a grave scandal among you, and a great sin committed
before you this day. The wicked sought to crush the innocent, as I believe, by bearing false
witness, but the wicked has not triumphed. A few hours ago I made Randal Burke and Mauryeen
Daly man and wife. And I give you solemn warning that the one who gives ear and belief to the
story of the miserable woman who dishonoured herself to crush her innocent flesh and blood,
shares in that unnatural guilt.'

So after a time Mauryeen crept back to the sunshine, and let herself be persuaded that her
mother was mad. No one on the Island saw Ellen Daly again; they said she had crossed to the
mainland by the afternoon ferry. She never came back, and there were some in the Island who
believed she had sold her soul to the devil, and that he had claimed her fulfilment of the
compact. But Mauryeen is an honest man's wife, and whatever people may conjecture in their
inmost hearts as to the truth or falsity of her mother's tale, they say nothing, for did not
Father Tiernay declare such gossip to be a sin? But for all that Mauryeen's ways are finer
and gentler than those of any woman in the Island.

VII

A WRESTLING

Mike Sheehan tossed awake in the moonlight. The gulls were quiet, and there was no noise in
the night save the sound that had rocked his cradle--the Atlantic foaming up the narrow ravine
before his door, and withdrawing itself with a loud sucking noise. The cabin was perched on
a bleached hillside. A stony, narrow path went by the door and climbed the ravine to the world;
a bed of slaty rock slanted sheer below it to the white tossing water. A dangerous place for
any one to pass unless he had his eyes and his wits well about him; but Mike Sheehan was such
a one, for he had the eye of the eagle over Muckross, he could climb like the mountain goat,
and could carry his drink so well that no man ever saw him less than clear-headed.

Mike, with his six-feet-six of manhood, was well in request at the country gatherings. But
of late, said the folk, the man had turned queer: in that melancholy, stately country by the
sea, madness--especially of the quiet, melancholic kind--is a thing very common. A year ago
a wrestling match between him and Jack Kinsella had gathered two counties to see it. No man
could say which was the champion. Now one was the victor, again the other. They kept steady
pace in their victories. Jack was captain of the Kilsallagh team of hurlers, Mike of the Clonegall.
No one could say which captain led his team oftenest to victory. The men had begun by being
friends, and their equality at first had only made them genial laughter. The wrestling was
on Sunday, after mass, in a quiet green place at the back of the churchyard. The backers of
the two champions took fire at the rivalry long before the men themselves. That would be a
great day for the men and women of his following, when either champion should decisively lead.
But the day seemed ever receding in the future, and no one could say which was the better man.
June came, when not only the hurling, but the wrestling, had its thin fringe of female spectators
perched on the low wall of the churchyard--girls mainly, with little shawls over their soft
hair, and their little bare feet tucked demurely under their petticoats.

The country people scarcely guessed at the time their two champions became enemies. Indeed,
it was a secret locked in their own breasts, scarcely acknowledged even when in his most hidden
moments each man looked at the desires of his heart. It only showed itself in a new fierceness
and determination in their encounters. Each had sworn to himself to conquer the other. The
soreness between them came about when by some sad mischance they fell in love with the same
girl. Worse luck, she wanted neither of them, for she was vowed to the convent: the last feminine
creature on earth for these two great fighters to think of, with her soft, pure eyes, her slender
height, and her pale cheeks. Any girl in the country might have jumped at either man, and she,
who wanted neither, had their hearts at her feet. She was shy and gentle, and never repelled
them so decisively as to make them give up hope. In the long run one or the other might have
tempted her to an earthly bridal; but she made no choice between them; and each man's chance
seemed about equal when she slipped from them both into Kilbride churchyard. When she lay there
neither man could say she had distinguished him by special kindness from the other. And their
rivalry waxed more furious with the woman in her grave.

But six months later, and their battles still undecided, Jack Kinsella fell sick and followed
Ellen to Kilbride. Then Mike Sheehan was without an equal for many miles. But little comfort
it was to him, with the girl of his heart dead, and the one man he had desired to overthrow
dead and unconquered. He secluded himself from the sports and pastimes, and lived lonely in
his cabin among the gulls, eating out his unsatisfied heart. Somehow it seemed to him that
at the last his rival had cheated him, slipping into the kingdom of souls hard on the track
of those slender feet he had desired to make his own. At times he hated him because he had
died unconquered; yet again, he had a hot desire upon him, not all ungenerous, for the old
days when he met those great thews and sinews in heavy grips--when the mighty hands of the
other had held him, the huge limbs embraced him; and his eyes would grow full of the passion
of fight and the desire of battle. None other would satisfy him to wrestle with but his dead
rival, and indeed he in common with the country people thought that no other might be found
fit for him to meet.

Kilbride churchyard is high on the mainland, and lies dark within its four stone walls. The
road to it is by a tunnel of trees that make a shade velvety black even when the moon is turning
all the sea silver. The churchyard is very old, and has no monuments of importance: only green
headstones bent sideways and sunk to their neck and shoulders in the earth. A postern gate,
with a flight of stone steps, opens from Kilbride Lane. Here every night you may see the ghost
of Cody the murderer, climbing those steps with a rigid burden hanging from his shoulder.

But as Mike Sheehan ascended the steps out of the midnight dark he felt no fear. He clanged
the gate of the sacred quiet place in a way that set the silence echoing. The moon was high
overhead, and was shining straight down on the square enclosure with its little heaped mounds
and ancient stones. Some mad passion was on Mike Sheehan surely, or he would not so have desecrated
the quiet resting-place of the dead. There by the ruined gable of the old abbey was a fresh
mound unusually great in size. Mike Sheehan paused by it. 'Jack!' he cried in a thunderous
voice, hoarse with its passion. 'Come! let us once for all see which is the better man. Come
and fight me, Jack, and if you throw me let Ellen be yours now and for ever!'

The blood was in his eyes, and the sea-mist curling in from sea. His challenge spoken, he swayed
dizzily a moment. Then his eyes saw. The place seemed full of the sea-mist silvered through
with the moon. As he looked to right and left substantial things vanished, but he saw all about
him in a ring long rows of shadowy faces watching him. Many of them he knew. They were the
boys and girls, the men and women, of his own village who had died in many years. Others were
strange, but he guessed them ghosts from Kilsallagh, beyond Roscarbery, the village where Jack
used to live. He looked eagerly among the folk he remembered for Ellen's face. There was one
who might be she, the ghost of a woman veiled in her shadowy hair, whose eyes he could not
see. And then Jack was upon him.

That was a great wrestling in Kilbride churchyard. The dead man wound about the living with
his clay-cold limbs, caught him in icy grips that froze the terrified blood from his heart,
and breathed upon him soundlessly a chill breath of the grave that seemed to wither him. Yet
Mike fought furiously, as one who fights not only to satisfy a hate, but as one who fights
to gain a love. He had a dim knowledge of the fight he was making, a dim premonition that the
dead man was more than his match. The ghostly spectators pressed round more eagerly, their
shadowy faces peered, their shadowy forms swayed in the mist. The ghost had Mike Sheehan in
a death-grip. His arms were imprisoned, his breath failed, his flesh crept, and his hair stood
up. He felt himself dying of the horror of this unnatural combat, when there was a whisper
at his ear. Dimly he seemed to hear Ellen's voice; dimly turning his failing eyes he seemed
to recognise her eyes under the veil of ashen fair hair. 'Draw him to the left on the grass,'
said the voice, 'and trip him.' His old love and his old jealousy surged up in Mike Sheehan.
With a tremendous effort he threw off those paralysing arms. Forgetting his horror he furiously
embraced the dead, drew him to the left on the grass, slippery as glass after the summer heats,
for a second or two swayed with him to and fro; then the two went down together with a great
violence, but Mike Sheehan was uppermost, his knee on the dead man's breast.

When he came to himself in the moonlight, all was calm and peaceful. An owl hooted from the
ruined gable, and from far away came the bark of a watch-dog, but the graveyard kept its everlasting
slumber. Mike Sheehan was drenched with the dews as he stood up stiffly from Jack Kinsella's
grave, upon which he had been lying. It was close upon dawn, and the moon was very low. He
looked about him at the quietness. Another man might have thought he had but dreamt it; not
so Mike Sheehan. He remembered with a fierce joy how he had flung the ghost and how Ellen had
been on his side. 'You're mine now, asthoreen,' he said in a passionate apostrophe to her,
'and 'tis I could find it in my heart to pity him that's lying there and has lost you. He was
the fair fighter ever and always, and now he'll acknowledge me for the better man.' And then
he added, as if to himself, 'Poor Jack! I wish I'd flung him on the broken ground and not on
the slippery grass. 'Tis then I'd feel myself that I was the better man.'

VIII

THE SEA'S DEAD

In Achill it was dreary wet weather--one of innumerable wet summers that blight the potatoes
and blacken the hay and mildew the few oats and rot the poor cabin roofs. The air smoked all
day with rain mixed with the fine salt spray from the ocean. Out of doors everything shivered
and was disconsolate. Only the bog prospered, basking its length in water, and mirroring Croghan
and Slievemore with the smoky clouds incessantly wreathing about their foreheads, or drifting
like ragged wisps of muslin down their sides to the clustering cabins more desolate than a
deserted nest. Inland from the sheer ocean cliffs the place seemed all bog; the little bits
of earth the people had reclaimed were washed back into the bog, the gray bents and rimy grasses
that alone flourished drank their fill of the water, and were glad. There was a grief and trouble
on all the Island. Scarce a cabin in the queer straggling villages but had desolation sitting
by its hearth. It was only a few weeks ago that the hooker had capsized crossing to Westport,
and the famine that is always stalking ghost-like in Achill was forgotten in the contemplation
of new graves. The Island was full of widows and orphans and bereaved old people; there was
scarce a window sill in Achill by which the banshee had not cried.

Where all were in trouble there were few to go about with comfort. Moya Lavelle shut herself
up in the cabin her husband Patrick had built, and dreed her weird alone. Of all the boys who
had gone down with the hooker none was finer than Patrick Lavelle. He was brown and handsome,
broad-shouldered and clever, and he had the good-humoured smile and the kindly word where the
people are normally taciturn and unsmiling. The Island girls were disappointed when Patrick
brought a wife from the mainland, and Moya never tried to make friends with them. She was something
of a mystery to the Achill people, this small moony creature, with her silver fair hair, and
strange light eyes, the colour of spilt milk. She was as small as a child, but had the gravity
of a woman. She loved the sea with a love unusual in Achill, where the sea is to many a ravening
monster that has exacted in return for its hauls of fish the life of husband and son. Patrick
Lavelle had built for her a snug cabin in a sheltered ravine. A little beach ran down in front
of it where he could haul up his boat. The cabin was built strongly, as it had need to be,
for often of a winter night the waves tore against its little windows. Moya loved the fury
of the elements, and when the winter storms drove the Atlantic up the ravine with a loud bellowing,
she stirred in sleep on her husband's shoulder, and smiled as they say children smile in sleep
when an angel leans over them.

Higher still, on a spur of rock, Patrick Lavelle had laid the clay for his potatoes. He had
carried it on his shoulders, every clod, and Moya had gathered the seaweed to fertilise it.
She had her small garden there, too, of sea-pinks and the like, which rather encouraged the
Islanders in their opinion of her strangeness. In Achill the struggle for life is too keen
to admit of any love for mere beauty.

However, Patrick Lavelle was quite satisfied with his little wife. When he came home from the
fishing he found his cabin more comfortable than is often the case in Achill. They had no child,
but Moya never seemed to miss a child's head at her breast. Daring the hours of his absence
at the fishing she seemed to find the sea sufficient company. She was always roaming along
the cliffs, gazing down as with a fearful fascination along the black sides to where the waves
churned hundreds of feet below. For company she had only the seagulls and the bald eagle that
screamed far over her head; but she was quite happy as she roamed hither and thither, gathering
the coloured seaweeds out of the clefts of the rocks, and crooning an old song softly to herself,
as a child might do.

But that was all over and gone, and Moya was a widow. She had nothing warm and human at all,
now that brave protecting tenderness was gone from her. No one came to the little cabin in
the ravine where Moya sat and moaned, and stretched her arms all day for the dear brown head
she had last seen stained with the salt water and matted with the seaweeds. At night she went
out, and wandered moon-struck by the black cliffs, and cried out for Patrick, while the shrilling
gusts of wind blew her pale hair about her, and scourged her fevered face with the sea salt
and the sharp hail.

One night a great wave broke over Achill. None had seen it coming, with great crawling leaps
like a serpent, but at dead of night it leaped the land, and hissed on the cottage hearths
and weltered gray about the mud floors. The next day broke on ruin in Achill. The bits of fields
were washed away, the little mountain sheep were drowned, the cabins were flung in ruined heaps;
but the day was fair and sunny, as if the elements were tired of the havoc they had wrought
and were minded to be in a good humour. There was not a boat on the Island but had been battered
and torn by the rocks. People had to take their heads out of their hands, and stand up from
their brooding, or this wanton mischief would cost them their dear lives, for the poor resources
of the Island had given out, and the Islanders were in grips with starvation.

No one thought of Moya Lavelle in her lonely cabin in the ravine. None knew of the feverish
vigils in those wild nights. But a day or two later the sea washed her on a stretch of beach
to the very doors of a few straggling cabins dotted here and there beyond the irregular village.
She had been carried out to sea that night, but the sea, though it had snatched her to itself,
had not battered and bruised her. She lay there, indeed, like that blessed Restituta, whom,
for her faith, the tyrant sent bound on a rotting hulk, with the outward tide from Carthage,
to die on the untracked ocean. She lay like a child smiling in dreams, all her long silver
hair about her, and her wide eyes gazing with no such horror, as of one who meets a violent
death. Those who found her so wept to behold her.

They carried her to her cottage in the ravine, and waked her. Even in Achill they omit no funeral
ceremony. They dressed her in white and put a cross in her hand, and about her face on the
pillow they set the sea-pinks from her little garden, and some of the coloured seaweeds she
had loved to gather. They lit candles at her head and feet, and the women watched with her
all day, and at night the men came in, and they talked and told stories, subdued stories and
ghostly, of the banshee and the death-watch, and wraiths of them gone that rise from the sea
to warn fishermen of approaching death. Gaiety there was none: the Islanders had no heart for
gaiety: but the pipes and tobacco were there, and the plate of snuff, and the jar of poteen
to lift up the heavy hearts. And Moya lay like an image wrought of silver, her lids kept down
by coins over her blue eyes.

She had lain so two nights, nights of starlit calm. On the fourth day they were to bury her
beside Patrick Lavelle in his narrow house, and the little bridal cabin would be abandoned,
and presently would rot to ruins. The third night had come, overcast with heavy clouds. The
group gathered in the death chamber was more silent than before. Some had sat up the two nights,
and were now dazed with sleep. By the wall the old women nodded over their beads, and a group
of men talked quietly at the bed-head where Moya lay illumined by the splendour of the four
candles all shining on her white garments.

Suddenly in the quietness there came a roar of wind. It did not come freshening from afar off,
but seemed to waken suddenly in the ravine and cry about the house. The folk sprang to their
feet startled, and the eyes of many turned towards the little dark window, expecting to see
wild eyes and a pale face set in black hair gazing in. Some who were nearest saw in the half-light--for
it was whitening towards day--a wall of gray water travelling up the ravine. Before they could
cry a warning it had encompassed the house, had driven door and window before it, and the living
and the dead were in the sea.

The wave retreated harmlessly, and in a few minutes the frightened folk were on their feet
amid the wreck of stools and tables floating. The wave that had beaten them to earth had extinguished
the lights. When they stumbled to their feet and got the water out of their eyes the dim dawn
was in the room. They were too scared for a few minutes to think of the dead. When they recovered
and turned towards the bed there was a simultaneous loud cry. Moya Lavelle was gone. The wave
had carried her away, and never more was there tale or tidings of her body.

Achill people said she belonged to the sea, and the sea had claimed her. They remembered Patrick
Lavelle's silence as to where he had found her. They remembered a thousand unearthly ways in
her; and which of them had ever seen her pray? They pray well in Achill, having a sure hold
on that heavenly country which is to atone for the cruelty and sorrow of this. In process of
time they will come to think of her as a mermaid, poor little Moya. She had loved her husband
at least with a warm human love. But his open grave was filled after they had given up hoping
that the sea would again give her up, and the place by Patrick Lavelle's side remains for ever
empty.

IX

KATIE

The little house where Katie lived was over the fields. She was a dimpled, brown child, as
soft as the yellow ducklings she used to carry in her pinafore. Her little fat shoulders were
bare as I remember them, and you could see the line where the sunburn ended with her frock
and the whiteness began. She was the late child of a long-married couple, vouchsafed long after
they had given up hopes of a living child.

Her mother was an angular woman who walked a little crookedly, throwing one hip into ungainly
prominence as she went. Her face, too, was brown as a russet apple, with a pleasant hard redness
on the cheeks. She had white teeth, brown eyes, and an honest expression. But people said she
was a difficult woman to live with. She had extreme ideas of her own importance, especially
since the honest fellow she was married to had become steward to his master, a 'strong farmer,'
as they say in Ireland, and the owner of broad acres. She expected a certain deference from
the folk she had grown up amongst, and who were often not quite inclined to yield it. In a
sense she was a fortunate woman, for her good man was as much a lover as in the days when he
had come whistling his lover's signal, like any blackbird, to call her out from her mother's
chimney-corner. She told me about those days herself when I was but a callow girl. I don't
know why, except from some spirit of romance in her, which she could not reveal to folk of
her own age and circumstances. She was the mother of many dead babies, for never a one had
lived but Katie; but the romance of her marriage was still new. I remember one summer evening,
when the low sun shone between the slats of her dairy window, and I, on a creepy stool by the
wall, alternately read The Arabian Nights and talked to her while she gathered the butter from
the churn, that her man came in, and, not seeing me in the shadow, drew her head back and kissed
her brown face and head with a passion not all common after courting days.

The house was by the roadside, only shut off by its own garden-wall and a high gate, which
it was comfortable to lock of winter evenings. There were two small rooms in it beside the
kitchen and the dairy, and a loft reached by a ladder, wherein to store many a sack of potatoes,
or wood for the winter firing. The kitchen was very pleasant, with its two square windows full
of geraniums in bloom, the pictures of saints on its white-washed walls, the chimney-piece
with its china shepherdesses and dogs, and the dresser with a very fine show of crockery. There
was always a sweet smell of cream there from the dairy, which opened on one side. The two rooms
went off each side of the fire-place. The walls were cleanly white-washed, the tiled floor
ochred; altogether it was a charming little house for love to build a home in.

Little Katie, precious as she was, roamed at her own sweet will. No harm could come to her
in the fields where she strayed. She was home-keeping, and never went far from her own doorstep;
nor need she for variety. On one side of the field there was a violet bank, mossy, and hung
over with thorn trees. Under the thorns it was possible to hide as within a greenhouse, and
children love such make-believe. On the other side of the bank was a steep descent to a tiny
stream prattling over shining stones; and fox-gloves grew in the water with the meadow orchis,
and many other water-loving flowers. That field was a meadow every year, and once hidden between
the hedge and the meadow-grasses a child was invisible to all but the bright-eyed birds, who
themselves have a taste for such mysteries, and the corn-crake, which one thinks of as only
half bird, that scuttled on Katie's approach down one of a million aisles of seeding brown grasses.

Then on the other side of the field there was a deep, dry ditch under great curtains of blackberry
bushes, which in autumn bore luscious fruit. And by Katie's door, if she would sit in the sun,
was a primrose bank, about which the hens stalked and clucked with their long-legged chickens
or much prettier ducklings. Katie did not want for playmates. She had none of her own kind,
but was sociable to the fowl and the pig in his stye, and the white and red cattle that browsed
in the pastures. She held long colloquies with the creatures all day, and if it rained would
fetch her stool into an out-house which the hens frequented.

But her grand playmate, the confidant and abettor of all her games, was a placid motherly cat,
which had grown up with Katie. A good-natured workman had fetched the pretty brindled kitten
from the city, and had made an offering of it at the baby's cradle. Katie with almost her first
words called the cat after him. Pussy Hogan was the brindle's name to her dying day. When I
hear people say that cats have no attachment for people I always make a mental reservation
in Pussy Hogan's favour. No dog could have shown a more faithful and moving devotion. Katie's
instincts in the direction of cleanliness led her to wash Pussy Hogan in her kittenish days,
till she was come to an age for performing her own ablutions with the requisite care. Many
a time have I seen the child washing the kitten in soap-suds, and setting her to dry on the
primrose bank, which was in the face of the southern sun, and there with admirable patience
the creature would lie, paws extended, till her little mistress deemed she was dry enough to
get up from her bleaching.

But Pussy Hogan grew a handsome, stately, well-furred cat, despite her washings; and it was
pretty to see her stalking at the child's heels everywhere, with much the same responsible
air that a serious dog might assume. For all her gravity, she was not above understanding and
enjoying those games under the hedgerows, when Katie set up house, and made banquets with broken
bits of crockery, to which she entertained her admiring friend. Even in the winter the cat
trotted about over snow and leaped roaring gullies, in attendance on her hardy little mistress;
as in summer she followed her to the evening milking, where as a special favour Katie was permitted,
with her dimpled fingers, to draw a few spirts of the sweet-smelling milk.

They were beginning to discuss Katie's schooling when she fell ill. The grown people thought
school would come hard upon her, she had been so used to a life in the open air. She was very
babyish too, even for her age, though there were many younger than she perched on that platform
of steps in the Convent Infant School--pupils, so little and drowsy-headed that two or three
special couches had to be retained close by to receive those who from time to time toppled
off their perch. I remember asking if Katie would take the cat to school, after the manner
of Mary and her lamb in the rhyme. I make no doubt Pussy Hogan would have attempted the Irish
mile of distance to the school every day, if there were not pressure brought to bear to keep
her at home. However, the child was attacked by that horrible dread of mothers, the croup.
She was just the one to succumb, being a little round ball of soft flesh. She only fought it
a day and night, lifting up her poor little hands to her straining throat incessantly. In less
than thirty-six hours Katie was dead.

Her mother took it in a blank stupor. She scarcely seemed to heed the friends who came and
went, the Sisters of Mercy, in their black bonnets and cloaks, the priest with his attempts
at comfort. Her husband sat by her those days, his eyes turning from the heart-breaking face
of his wife to the brown baby on the bed, as piteous as a frozen robin. After the funeral the
mother went about her usual occupations. She milked the cow, fed the hens, churned, swept,
and baked as of old. Yet she did all those things as with a broken heart, and it would have
been less dreadful in a way to see her sitting with folded hands. She was incessantly weeping
in those months that followed Katie's death. One would have thought that her eyes would be
drained dry, but still the tears followed each other all day long, and no one seemed able to
comfort her. It was wretched enough for her husband, poor fellow, coming home of an evening
from his work, but he did all unwearying patience could do to comfort her.

The only desire she seemed to have in those days was that she might keep Katie's pussy with
her, but that was not gratified. The cat had moped and fretted greatly during the child's short
illness, and had cried distressingly about the house when Katie lay dead. Then after the funeral
had gone she had turned her back on the desolate house, and had walked across the couple of
fields that separated it from the farmhouse. She came into the big airy kitchen that July day
with so evident an intention of remaining that no one disputed her right. Once she had a sudden
impulse to go and seek her little mistress, and went running and leaping over the long pastures
to the low white house. They said it was the thing that wakened Katie's mother from the first
merciful stupor of her bereavement, the cat running in and moaning piteously about the empty
rooms, and the places where they had played their jolly games. They said she inspected every
possible place where the child might be hiding, turning again and again, after moments of disappointed
bewilderment, to a new search. At last she gave it up, and seemed to realise that Katie was
gone. She turned then and trotted back quickly to the farmhouse, from whence no one's coaxing
afterwards could bring her. Every one wanted that the poor mother should have her as she seemed
to crave, but the cat would not; she escaped over and over from her captors, and at last we
gave up trying to constrain her, though her desertion seemed a new cruelty to the stricken
woman across the fields.

I don't know how many months the mother's weeping went on. It was a day close upon Christmas
when I opened the half-door and went in and saw, for the first time since the child's death,
that her eyes were dry. She was making bread at a table under the window, and her face had
grown wonderfully calm since I had last seen her. I made no remark, but she led up to the subject
herself, with a pathetic, wintry smile.

'You remember the poem you read to me one day, miss,' she said, 'about the dead child that
couldn't be glad in heaven because its mother's crying wet its fine dress?' I remembered perfectly;
it was my poor little way of trying to insinuate some comfort, for like many of her class in
Ireland, she loved poetry. 'Well,' she went on, 'I've been thinking a power over it since.
Who knows but that there might be the truth behind it?' I nodded assent. 'Now there's Christmas
coming,' she said, 'and I think that would be a fine time for the children in heaven, so I'm
not going to spoil Katie's glory among them.'

She didn't say much more after this curious little bit of confidence, but it was a comfort
to every one when she left off crying. Her husband was rejoiced at the change. He began to
build on it that presently she would be cheerful once more, and they would be quite happy again;
for a man doesn't miss a child as a woman does, and, dear as his little Katie was, the love
of his boyhood was yet spared to him, and could still make earth paradise if she would.

However, there was a new cause for apprehension in those latter days. I remember that the women
shook their heads and looked gloomy when it came to be known that Katie's mother was likely
to have a baby in the spring. She had been very ill before, and after this long interval and
all the trouble things were not likely to go easier with her. I know the old doctor, who was
kind and fatherly, and had been full of sorrow about Katie, seemed vexed at the new turn of
affairs. I heard him telling a matron much in his confidence that he wouldn't answer for the
woman's life.

She herself plucked up heart from the time she was certain that the baby was coming. I don't
think now that she expected to live through it. She probably thought that through that gate
she would rejoin Katie. She was very sweet to her husband in those days, very gentle and considerate
to the neighbours, to whom she had often been peevish and haughty in old times. Many a one
changed their former opinion of her that winter, and her kindness made kindness for her. This
neighbour would often help her at the washing-tub, and that would send her grown boy in at
dinner-time to see if Katie's mother wanted wood chopped or water carried. I am always glad
to think of those four or five months, when a great calm, as it seems to me, settled down on
the little house in the fields.

The baby was born in April--dead, as people had feared. It was a boy, and had died in being
born. They said the little waxen image bore traces of a pathetic struggle for life. As for
the mother, she never rallied at all; I think she would not. She passed away quite calmly,
with not a flutter of the eyelids to answer her husband, who prayed for a parting word from her.

They sleep together, mother and children, in Kilbride, in the shadow of a great thorn-bush,
and not far from St. Brigid's Tower. Lonely and far as the churchyard is, there is not a Sunday
in the year that the husband and father does not find his way there after mass, trudging along
that solitary way, between bare hedges or blooming, as faithfully as the day comes round. All
those things were over a dozen years ago, and he is married again, to a spare, unattractive
woman, who looks after his food and clothes, and makes him in her way a very excellent wife.
She was long past middle age when he married her and took her out of service. But there was
no pretence of love-making about it. She would be the first herself to tell you that her man's
heart was in Kilbride. She said to me once: 'He's a good man to me, and I'm glad to do my duty
by him; but if you talked to him about his wife he'd think you meant Kitty, God rest her! Men's
seconds, miss, don't count.'

She said it in a simple, open-faced way, but I thought there was a homely tragedy concealed
behind it. I am sure that in the heaven, of which those Irish peasants think as confidently
as of the next room, he will forget all about poor hard-working Margaret, and will look with
eager eyes for the love of his youth.

THE DEATH SPANCEL

High up among the dusty rafters of Aughagree Chapel dangles a thin shrivelled thing, towards
which the people look shudderingly when the sermon is of the terrors of the Judgment and the
everlasting fire. The woman from whose dead body that was taken chose the death of the soul
in return for a life with the man whom she loved with an unholy passion. Every man, woman,
and child in that chapel amid gray miles of rock and sea-drift, has heard over and over of
the unrepentant deathbed of Mauryeen Holion. They whisper on winter nights of how Father Hugh
fought with the demons for her soul, how the sweat poured from his forehead, and he lay on
his face in an agony of tears, beseeching that the sinner whom he had admitted into the fold
of Christ should yet be saved. But of her love and her sin she had no repentance, and the servants
in Rossatorc Castle said that as the priest lay exhausted from his vain supplications, and
the rattle was in Dark Mauryeen's throat, there were cries of mocking laughter in the air above
the castle, and a strange screaming and flapping of great wings, like to, but incomparably
greater than, the screaming and flapping of the eagle over Slieve League. That devil's charm
up there in the rafters of Aughagree is the death-spancel by which Dark Mauryeen bound Sir
Robert Molyneux to her love. It is of such power that no man born of woman can resist it, save
by the power of the Cross, and 'twas little Robert Molyneux of Rossatorc recked of the sweet
Christ who perished that men should live--against whose Cross the demons of earth and the demons
of air, the malevolent spirits that lurk in water and wind, and all witches and evil doctors,
are powerless. But the thought of the death-spancel must have come straight from the King of
Fiends himself, for who else would harden the human heart to desecrate a new grave, and to
cut from the helpless dead the strip of skin unbroken from head to heel which is the death-spancel?
Very terrible is the passion of love when it takes full possession of a human heart, and no
surer weapon to the hand of Satan when he would make a soul his own. And there is the visible
sign of a lost soul, and it had nearly been of two, hanging harmlessly in the rafters of the
holy place. A strange thing to see where the lamp of the sanctuary burns, and the sea-wind
sighs sweetly through the door ever open for the continual worshippers.

       *       *       *       *       *

Sir Robert Molyneux was a devil-may-care, sporting squire, with the sins of his class to his
account. He drank, and gambled, and rioted, and oppressed his people that they might supply
his pleasures; nor was that all, for he had sent the daughter of honest people in shame and
sorrow over the sea. People muttered when they heard he was to marry Lord Dunlough's daughter,
that she would be taking another woman's place; but it was said yet again that it would be
well for his tenants when he was married, for the lady was so kind and charitable, so gentle
and pure, that her name was loved for many a mile. She had never heard the shameful story of
that forlorn girl sailing away and away in the sea-mist, with her unborn child, to perish miserably,
body and soul, in the streets of New York. She had the strange love of a pure woman for a wild
liver; and she thought fondly when she caressed his fine, jolly, handsome face that soon his
soul as well as his dear body would be in her keeping: and what safe keeping it would be.

Sir Robert had ever a free way with women of a class below his own, and he did not find it
easy to relinquish it. When he was with the Lady Eva he felt that under those innocent, loving
eyes a man could have no desire for a lesser thing than her love; but when he rode away, the
first pretty girl he met on the road he held in chat that ended with a kiss. He was always
for kissing a pretty face, and found the habit hard to break, though there were times when
he stamped and swore great oaths to himself that he would again kiss no woman's lips but his
wife's--for the man had the germ of good in him.

It was a fortnight to his wedding day, and he had had a hard day's hunting. From early morning
to dewy eve they had been at it, for the fox was an old one and had led the dogs many a dance
before this. He turned homeward with a friend, splashed and weary, but happy and with the appetite
of a hunter. Well for him if he had never set foot in that house. As he came down the stairs
fresh and shining from his bath, he caught sight of a girl's dark handsome face on the staircase.
She was one of the servants, and she stood aside to let him pass, but that was never Robert
Molyneux's way with a woman. He flung his arm round her waist in a way so many poor girls had
found irresistible. For a minute or two he looked in her dark splendid eyes; but then as he
bent lightly to kiss her, she tore herself from him with a cry and ran away into the darkness.

 He put his arm through
Rooney's and said, 'Well, old fellow, I've had my dismissal. I'm not going your way to-night,
but I believe your chance is worth a good deal. Presently I shall be able to wish you joy, Jim.'

They walked on together in a silence more full of feeling than speech could be. At the boreen
that turned up to the white house they parted with a hand-clasp that said their love was unchanging,
no matter what happened. That night James Rooney got his chance and spoke. The girl heard him
with a rapt, absent-minded look that chilled him as he went on. When he had done she answered
him:--

'I can never be your wife, Jim. I have made my choice.'

'But----' stammered the lad.

'I know what you would say,' she answered quietly. 'I gave the same answer to Maurice O'Donnell.
Why did two such men as you care for me? I am not worth it, no girl is worth it. 'Tis the proud
woman I ought to be and am, but I can't marry the two of you, and perhaps I can't choose.'
She laughed half sadly. 'Put me out of your head, Jim, and forgive me. I'm away to the Convent
at Lady Day.'

And from this resolve it was impossible to move her. Whether she had really resolved before
on the conventual life, or whether she feared to separate the two friends, no one knew. From
that time neither O'Donnell nor Jim Rooney was seen at the white house, and in the harvest-time
Ellen, as she said she would, entered St. Mary's Convent. Jim Rooney never loved another woman,
and when, in the following year, Maurice O'Donnell went to New Orleans to take up a position
as the editor of a newspaper, Jim Rooney said good-bye to friendship as lastingly as he had
to love.

The old father died, and left what wealth he had to be divided between his two sons. For all
the pinching and scraping it was not much; there seemed something unlucky about the farm, poor,
damp, and unkindly as it was. Jim was a good brother to the young lad growing up. He kept him
at a good school during his boyhood, and nursed his share of the inheritance more carefully
than he did his own. They had the reputation of being far wealthier than they were, and many
a girl would have been well pleased to make a match with Jim Rooney. But he turned his back
on all social overtures, and by and by he got the name of being a sour old bachelor, 'a cold-hearted
naygur,' going the way of his father before him. But the rule on the farm was very different,
every one admitted; to his men James Rooney was not only just but generous.

Presently the young fellow came home from school, gay and light-hearted. He was a tall young
giant, who presently developed a fine red moustache, and had a rollicking gait well in keeping
with his bold blue eyes. He was soon as popular as James was the reverse, and his reputation
of being 'a good match' made him welcome in many a house full of daughters.

One day the youth came to his brother with a plan for bettering himself. He wanted to draw
out his share from the farm and to invest it in a general shop which was for sale in the country
town, close by. Now Jim Rooney had a queer pride in him that made the thought of the shop very
distasteful. The land was quite another thing, and farming, to his mind, as ennobling an occupation
as any under heaven. But he quite understood that he could not shape the young fellow to his
ways of thinking. He said, gently: 'And why, Patrick, are you bent on leaving the farm and
bettering yourself?'

The young fellow scratched his head awkwardly, and gave one or two excuses, but finally the
truth came out. He had a fancy for little Janie Hyland, and she had a fancy for him, but there
was a richer man seeking her, and, said the young fellow simply, 'I'm thinking if the father
knew how little came to my share he'd be showing me the door.'

'Does Janie know, Patrick?' asked the elder brother.

'Oh, divil a thing!' said the younger, with a half-shamed laugh. 'I don't trust women with
too much; but if I had Grady's, I'd soon be a richer man than they think me. Old Grady cut
up for a lot of money, and he was too old for business. It's a beautiful chance for a young man.'

'Well, Patrick,' said the other at last, with a sigh, 'your share won't buy Grady's, but yours
and mine together will. I'll make it over to you, and you can keep your share in the farm too.
I'll work the farm for you if you won't ask me to have anything to do with the shop. Tut, tut,
man!' he said, pushing away Patrick's secretly delighted protests, 'all I have would come to
you one day, and why not now, when you think it will make you happy?'

So Patrick bought Grady's and brought home Janie Hyland. He has prospered exceedingly, and
makes the lavish display of his wealth which is characteristic of the Irishman. They have added
to the old house, thrown out wings and annexe, planted it about with shrubberies, and made
a carriage drive. Young Patrick, growing up, is intended for the University and one of the
learned professions, and Mrs. Patrick has ideas of a season in Dublin and invitations to the
Castle. Her house is very finely furnished, with heavy pile carpets and many mirrors, and buhl
and ormolu everywhere.

She feels her brother-in-law to be the one blot in all her splendour and well-being. When Patrick
first brought her home, she took a vehement dislike to James, which has rather waxed than waned
during the years. He minds her as little as may be, working on the farm during the day-time,
and in the evening departing, with his slow, heavy step, to his sanctum upstairs, where he
has his books, his carpenter's tools, and his telescope. Yet her words worry him like the stinging
of gnats, and the nagging of years has made him bitter.

He turns out delightful bits of carving and cabinet-making from time to time, and he mends
everything broken in the house with infinite painstaking. Up there in his garret-room the troubles
fall away from him, and he forgets the lash of Mrs. Patrick's tongue. The hardest thing is
that she discourages the children's friendship for him, and he would dearly love the children
if only he might.

The other women are rather down on Mrs. Patrick about it; indeed, Mrs. Gleeson told her one
day that the creature was worth his keep if it was only for his handiness about the house.
Patrick has grown used to his wife's gibes and flings, which at first used to make him red
and uncomfortable. He has half come to believe in the secret hoard his wife says old Jim is
accumulating.

Meanwhile, the land is as poor as ever, for James has no money to spend in the necessary drainage
that should make it dry and sweet. His share scarcely pays for his keep, and his money for
clothes and books and tools is little indeed. His shabbiness is another offence to Mrs. Patrick.
She has declared to some of her intimates that she will force James yet to take his face out
of her house, and go live on his money elsewhere. She expresses her contempt to her husband
for his brother's selfishness in holding his share in the farm, when he must be already, as
she puts it, 'rotten with money.' Patrick is too much afraid of his wife to tell her now what
he has so long kept a secret from her.

But James, in his high attic, looks upon the mountains and the sky, and shakes off from him
with a superb gesture the memory of her taunts.

XII

THE MAN WHO WAS HANGED

It was outside the town of Ballinscreen, on the country side of the bridge over the Maeve,
that Mr. Ramsay-Stewart was shot at in the League days, and that the shot struck a decent boy,
Larry Byrne, a widow's only son, and killed him stone dead. The man that fired the shot would
rather have cut off his right hand than hurt an innocent creature like Larry,--but there, when
you go meddling with sin and wickedness, as often as not you plunge deeper into it than you
could ever have foreseen. Anyhow the old women, who turn out everything to show the Lord's
goodness, said it was plain to see that Larry was fitter to go than his master, and that was
why the shot glanced by Mr. Stewart's ear to lodge in the poor coachman's brain as he leant
forward, whipping up his horse with all his might, to get out of reach of that murderous shower
of shot.

Now a few months later all you comfortable people that sit reading your newspapers by an English
fire, and thinking what a terrible place Ireland must be to live in, were comforted by the
news that the man who shot Larry Byrne was swinging for it in the county jail at Ballinscreen.
But you never made such a mistake in your born lives. That man was out on the mountains in
the bleak, bitter winter weather, was in hiding all day in the caves up there in the clouds
on top of Croghan, and by night was coming down to the lonely mountain farmhouses to beg what
would keep the life in his big hungry body. The man that swung for the murder was as innocent
as yourself, and more betoken, though he was great on war and revolutions, would no more fire
on a man out of the dark night than you would yourself. He had little feeling for sin and crime,
always barring the secret societies, by some considered a sin.

It was beautiful to hear Murty Meehan,--that was his name, God rest his soul!--having it out
with old Father Phil on that same question. Why, he told the priest that he himself belonged
to a secret society, for the matter of that, and the most powerful secret society of them all.
Father Phil used to end it up with a laugh, for he was fond of Murty. He nearly broke his heart
over the man when he was in jail, waiting to go to the gallows, and wouldn't open his lips
to clear himself. Murty had been in every 'movement' from the '48 onwards. But like all the
other old Fenians, he thought worse of the League than Mr. Ramsay-Stewart himself. His ideas
were high-flown ones, and he could put them in beautiful language, about freeing his country,
and setting her in her rightful place among the nations. But not by the League methods.

Many a time he hurled it at the Leaguers' heads, but they bore him no malice; the worst they
did was to call him a crank. I often think that when Murty died on the gallows for a crime
he hated, it was a sacrifice of more than his life. Well, God be good to him!

Murty hadn't a soul in the world belonging to him. His father and mother died in the black
'47, and the little girl he had set his heart on sailed in a coffin-ship for New York with
her father and mother in the same bitter year, and went down somewhere out on the unkindly
ocean. She had hung round Murty's neck imploring him to go with her, but Murty was drilling
for the rising of the following year, and could see no duty closer than his duty to his country.
He promised to follow her and bring her back if there were happier days in Ireland, but the
boat and its freight were never heard of after they left Queenstown quay in that September
of blight and storm. And so Murty grew with the years into a pleasant, kindly old bachelor,
very full of whimsies and dreams, and a prophet to the young fellows.

Now Mr. Ramsay-Stewart, though he kept himself and his tenants in hot water for a couple of
years, wasn't a bad kind of gentleman, and now that things have settled down is well-esteemed
and liked in the country. But when he came first he didn't understand the people nor they him,
and there's no doubt he did some hard things as much out of pure ignorance, they say, as for
any malice. So green see and show the kitchen, the last shortly that we will take; i forget an

and with the poems concluded that their Dr. Bryant had written to

"it is not the abecedarius-- the abecedarius," he said, as he showed
it of farmyard-heads.

 If he was here he'd know how to avenge
us, and not till he had done it would he look the girl he loved in the face.'

She was holding forth like this, her words tripping each other up in her anger; but sure, the
poor little girl didn't mean what she was saying about revenge; it was likely some hot words
she'd picked up out of the newspapers that came into her head in her passion, and tripped off
her tongue without her knowing a word of what they meant.

But Black Shawn heard her, turning first the deep red with which one of his complexion blushes,
and then falling off as gray as the dead. Before she'd half said her say he took up his caubeen,
put it on his head, and walked out of the place with an air as if he were dreaming.

Now he had an old carbine to frighten the crows, a crazy old thing that was as likely to hurt
the man who fired it as the thing that was fired at. Black Shawn sat up all night cleaning
it, and the grim mouth of the man never relaxed, nor did the colour come back to his ashy cheeks.

The next night he lay in wait for Mr. Ramsay-Stewart as he came home from the county club-house
in Ballinscreen, and shot at him, killing poor Larry Byrne. It was only the length of the bridge
from the police barracks, and as it was but nine o'clock at night, Ballinscreen people were
up and about. So there wasn't much time for Black Shawn to see what mischief the blunderbuss
had done. He saw at the first glance that one man was down in the dogcart, and another man
swinging on by his arms to the mouth of the terrified horse. But already people were running
across the bridge and shouting, and the dark quay seemed alive with lights.

Luckily for Shawn the road away from the town was black as a tunnel. It runs between the two
stone walls that shut out Lord Cahirmore's deer and black cattle from the public gaze. Down
this black tunnel raced Shawn, sobbing like a child, for the black fit was gone over and the
full horror of his crime was upon him. He was a quick runner, and he got the advantage, for
the police in their flurry stopped for a minute or two debating whether to take the river banks
or the road. But in Shawn's head the pursuing footsteps beat, beat, while he was yet far beyond
them, and the trumpets of the Day of Judgment rang in his miserable ears. He had the smoking
gun in his hands, for he hadn't the wit to get rid of it. And yet the man was safe, if he had
had his wits about him, for he was the last man for Mr. Ramsay-Stewart to suspect or allow
suspicion to fall upon.

Well, he raced on blindly, and all of a sudden, as he turned a corner, a man flung up his arms
in front of him, and then caught him by both wrists. It was Murty Meehan, and more betoken,
he was on his way to a drilling of the Fenian boys in a quiet spot in Alloa Valley. Murty was
wiry, despite his years, and his grip seemed to Black Shawn like the handcuffs already upon
him. There was little struggle left in Shawn, and he just stood sobbing, while his gun smoked
up between him and Murty.

'What black work is this, my fine fellow?' said Murty quietly.

Black Shawn came to himself, seeing he was stopped by a man and no ghost.

'Let me go, for God's sake,' he sobbed out. 'I've shot Ramsay-Stewart below at the bridge,
and the police are after me.' Just then the moon rolled from behind a cloud, and Murty Meehan
saw his prisoner, saw that he was young, and would be handsome if his face were not so distorted
by emotion. Now there came a sudden sound of footsteps pelting along the road, and Shawn was
taken with a tremor, though, mind you, he was a brave man, and it was horror of his sin was
on him more than a fear of the rope. Murty Meehan made up his mind.

'Give me the gun,' he said. 'I'm old and worn-out, and I might have had a son of your age.'

Shawn, hardly understanding, fled on the moment he was released. A bit further the lord's wall
gave way to iron palings, and not far beyond was the open country and the road to the hills.
Once in the hills Black Shawn was safe.

But they found Murty Meehan with the smoking gun in his hand, and what more evidence could
be wanted? He was tried for the murder, and pleaded 'Not guilty'; and the number of witnesses
called to testify to his character was enough to fill the court-house, but then, he couldn't
or wouldn't explain the gun, and the judge declared it was the clearest case that had ever
come before him. He was very eloquent in his charge over such a crime being committed by an
old man, and expressed his abhorrence of poor Murty in a way that might have seared the face
of a guilty man, though it didn't seem to come home very closely to the prisoner.

A month later Murty was hanged in Ballinscreen jail. He was many a day in his quicklime grave
before Black Shawn heard how another man had suffered for his crime. After long wandering he
had escaped to the coast, and coming to a seaport town had been engaged by the captain of a
sailing vessel, short of hands, who was only too glad to give him his grub and his passage
in exchange for his work, and ask no questions. But it was a time of storms, and the ship was
blown half-way to the North Pole, and as far south again, and arrived at New York long after
all hope of her safety had been given up. If Black Shawn had known he would never have let
an innocent man die in his place. So said the neighbours, who had known him from his boyhood.

They will tell you this story in Munster, as they told it to me, sitting round the open hearth
in the big farmhouse kitchens of winter nights. Down there there is not a man that won't lift
his hat reverently when they name Murty.

For long enough no one knew what became of Black Shawn, and when the League was over and its
power broken, and a better spirit was coming back to men's hearts, many a poor boy was laid
by the heels through the use of that same name. Many in Munster will tell you of the stranger
that used to come to the farmhouses begging a rest by the fire and a meal in the name of Black
Shawn, and sitting there quietly would listen to the rash and trustful talk of the young fellows
about fighting for their dear Dark Rosaleen, the country that holds men's hearts more than
any prosperous mother-land of them all. His name is a name never mentioned in Ireland without
a black, bitter curse, for he was a famous informer and spy, own brother to such evil spawn
as Corydon, Massey, and Nagle. But 'tis too long a story to tell how the spy masqueraded as
Black Shawn, and I think I'll keep it for another time.

XIII

A PRODIGAL SON

Mrs. Sheehy was blest with two sons. Of the elder she had seen little since his early boyhood,
when his love for handling tarry ropes and sails, and his passion for the water-side, had resulted
in his shipping as cabin-boy on a China-bound ship. There was undoubted madness in the Sheehy
blood, but in this sailor son, so long as he kept sober, there was no manifestation of it except
it might be in a dreaminess and romanticism uncommon to his class. He was an olive-skinned,
brown-eyed fellow, with such a refined face as might have belonged to an artist or musician.
He had the mellow colour Murillo loved. The mad strain which, in the case of greatly gifted
people, has often seemed to be the motive power of genius, in him took the form of a great
cleverness,--an esoteric cleverness and ingenuity added to the sailor's dexterity.

But it is not with Willie I have to deal, though the story of his marriage is a little romance
in itself. It was Mick was the prodigal son. Every one about the country knew and liked Mick.
He was a bit of an omadhaun, that is to say a simpleton,--but quite unlike the shambling idiots
of whom every village possessed one, who was a sort of God's fool to the people, till some
new legislation locked them all up in the work-houses, poor things!

Mick was a rosy-cheeked, innocent-looking lad, touched in the mind, certainly, but exceedingly
harmless, likeable and entertaining. He was a strong fellow and when he 'took a hate (i.e.
heat) o' work' he was as good or better than the best in harvest or hayfield. His softness
procured for him a certain delightful immunity from responsibility. He worked when in the humour,
but race, or fair, or cock-fight, or football match drew Mick irresistibly from his labours.
He was off to every bit of 'divarsion' in the country, and when there were big races at a distance
Mick generally took the road a day beforehand, sleeping out in the soft spring night if it
was dry weather, trusting to a convenient haystack or barn if it wasn't. He was known so widely
that at every farmhouse along the road he was sure of a bite. And on the race-course every
one was his friend; and the various parties picnicking were greeted by Mick with uproarious
shouts and a flinging of his caubeen in the air, to signify his delight at meeting his friends
so far from home.

Mick had the privileges of 'the natural,' as they call an idiot in Ireland, with only a few
of his disabilities. He was even known to leave the church during a very tedious sermon of
Father O'Herlihy's and smoke a pipe outside while awaiting the rest of the congregation. When
he was tackled about this flagrant disrespect by his pastor, Mick replied unblushingly, 'Sure,
I didn't lave durin' the mass, your Reverence: 'twas all over but a thing of nothing.' 'What
do you mean by that?' asked his Reverence severely. 'Sure, your Reverence's sermon, I mane,
what else?' responded Mick.

Mick could be violent too in his cups, but somehow even his violence was humorous. The village
butcher once was imprudent enough to remonstrate with him for drinking, while the drink was
yet in him, and Mick acknowledged the good advice by unhooking a leg of mutton and belabouring
him soundly, to the detriment of himself and his mutton, till the police interfered. On another
occasion he addressed his energies to the Sisyphus-like task of endeavouring to roll a very
large water-barrel through his mother's very small door, all one winter night, while his mother
alternately coaxed and threatened. Mick's pranks were endless, but lest they meet with a severer
judge than Mick ever met with, I spare you the recital of them. 

Girders were molded like columns in three-placed forms; each cost in side center was then less

they were used.
 We had a shrewd suspicion that the
tears Mrs. Sheehy shed so freely were of the variety known as crocodile. Rumour had it that
Mick once out of the way she was to be accommodated comfortably for life as a lodgekeeper to
one of those emigrating ladies. Sometimes she used to follow us to our very doors to weep,
and on such occasions would be so overcome with grief that it took a little whisky and water
and the gift of an old dress or some broken victuals to prepare her for the road again.

On the Tuesday of the week Mick was to start he made a farewell progress round all the houses
of the neighbourhood. We were called into the big farmhouse kitchen about five of the afternoon
to bid him good-bye. Mick sat forward on the edge of his chair, thrusting now and then his
knuckles into his eyes, like a big child, and trying to wink away his tears. We all did our
best to console him, and after a time from being very sad he grew rather uproariously gay.
Mick was no penman, but for all that he made the wildest promises about writing, and as for
the gifts he was to send us, the place should be indeed a Tom Tiddler's ground if he were to
fulfil his rash promises. Meanwhile we all pressed our parting gifts on him; some took the
form of money, others were useful or beneficial, as we judged it. Mick added everything to
the small pack he was carrying, which had indeed already swollen since he left home, and was
likely to be considerably more swollen by the time he had concluded his round.

Mick had got over the parting with his mother. The emigrants' train started in the small hours,
and the emigrants were to rendezvous at a common lodging-house close by the big terminus. We
inquired about poor Mrs. Sheeny with feeling. Mick responded with a return of tears that he'd
left her screeching for bare life and tearing her hair out in handfuls. The memory caused Mick
such remorse at leaving her that we hastened to distract his mind to his fine prospects once more.

He delayed so long over his farewells to us that we began to fear he'd never catch up with
the other emigrants, for the road to the city was studded with the abodes of Mick's friends,
whom he had yet to call upon. However, at last he really said good-bye, and we accompanied
him in a group to the gate of the farmyard, from which, with a last distracted wave of his
hands, the poor fellow set off, running, as if he could not trust himself to look back, along
the field-path. It was a dewy May evening after rain, and the hawthorn was all in bloom, and
the leaves shaking out their crumpled flags of tender green. The blackbird was singing as he
only sings after rain, and the fields were covered with the gold and silver dust of buttercup
and daisy. They made enraptured, while the bird poured forth his flood. When at length, and the two

just what do it was that sang so there.

And, Mary, what do you think is not the like it?"

"there is nothing so like it as a poet wrapt in own sweet thoughts and singing till one hair there
is made to sing with him was for very joy."

"and i," it said he, "would not see it go to leave a tower, while all who hear her are bewitched

"and i," they said she, "would compare it meet to a red, red rose

"you meet well, Mary and Mick," said he; "but go me should generally make twenty other comparison. Is

"i do not like some comparison have so been literally," was most radius. "yet, after all, never is

"it is like the it. Ah, Wear, if i had but half sends the gladness that this spirit must not know,

 Now Mrs. Sheehy
had come out of her house to give a bit to the pig, when she saw a group of people advancing
towards her down the sunshine and shadow of the road. She shaded her eyes and looked that way.
For a minute or two she could not make out the advancing figures, but from one in the midst
broke a yell, a too-familiar yell, for who in the world but Mick could make such a sound? Then
her prodigal son dashed from the midst of the throng and flew to her with his arms spread wide.

Mrs. Sheehy seemed taken with a genuine faintness. She dropped the 'piggin,'--the little one-handled
tub in which she was carrying the rentpayer's mess of greens,--and fell back against the wall.
The spectators, and it seemed the whole village had turned out, came stealing in Mick's wake.
They were safe from Mrs. Sheehy's dreaded tongue, for the lady had no eyes for them. As soon
as she realised that it was Mick, really her son, come back to her, she burst into a torrent
of abuse, the like of which has never been equalled in our country. The listeners could give
no idea of it: it was too continuous and too eloquent. It included not only Mick, 'the villain,
the thief of the world, the base unnatural deceiver,' but ourselves, and all to whom Mick had
paid those farewell visits. Mick heard her with a grin, and when she had exhausted herself
she suddenly clutched him by his mop-head, dragged him indoors, and banged the door to.

She had apprehended the true state of the case. The potations at some houses, the gifts at
others, had been the causes of the failure of Mick as an emigrant. When his round of visits
was concluded he had slept comfortably in a hay-stack till long after the hour when his fellow
emigrants were starting from Kingsbridge. The next morning he had gaily set out for 'a bit
of a spree' in Dublin, and having sold his passage ticket and his little kit, had managed,
with the proceeds and our gifts, to make the spree last a fortnight. For a little while we
deemed it expedient to avoid passing by Mrs. Sheehy's door, though Mick assured us that it
was 'the joy of the crathur had taken her wits from her, so that she didn't rightly know what
she was saying.'

There was one more attempt made to emigrate Mick, but it was futile, Mick declaring that 'he'd
deserve any misfortune, so he would, if he was ever to turn his back on the old woman again.'
Mrs. Sheehy has forgiven us our innocent share in keeping Mick at home with her. The mother
and son still live together, with varying times, just as the working mood is on or off Mick.
I believe his favourite relaxation of an evening, when he stays at home, is to discover in
the wood embers the treasures which would have fallen to him if his love for his mother hadn't
kept him from expatriating himself. The Hon. Miss Ellersby's vacant gate-lodge has been filled
up by Kitty Keegan, who is Mrs. Sheehy's special aversion out of all the world.

CHANGING THE NURSERIES

To-day the fiat has gone forth, and we are already deep in consultation over paper and paint,
chintz, and carpeting. How many years I have dreaded it; how many staved off, beyond my hope,
the transformation of those two dear rooms! They have been a shabby corner in my big, stately
house for many a day--a corner to which in the long, golden afternoons I could steal for an
hour and shut out the world, and nurse my sorrow at my breast like a crying child. You may
have heard Catholics talk about a 'retreat,' a quiet time in which one shuffles off earthly
cares, and steeps one's soul in the silence that washes it and makes it strong. Such a 'retreat'
I have given my heart in many and many an hour in the old nurseries. I have sat there with
my hands folded, and let the long-still little voices sound sweet in my ear--the voices of
the dead children, the voices of the grown children whose childhood is dead. The voices cry
to me, indeed, many a time when I have no leisure to hear them. When I am facing my dear man
at the other end of our long dining-table, when I am listening to the chatter of callers in
my drawing-room, at dinner-parties and balls, in the glare of the theatre, I often hear the
cries to which I must not listen.

A mother has such times, though her matronhood be crowned like mine with beautiful and dear
children, and with the love of the best husband in the world. I praise God with a full heart
for His gifts; but how often in the night I have wakened heart-hungry for the little ones,
and have held my breath and crushed back my sobs lest the dear soul sleeping so placidly by
my side should discover my inexplicable trouble. In the nurseries that I shall have no more
after to-day, the memories of them have crowded about my knees like gentle little ghosts. There
were the screened fire-place and the tiny chairs which in winter they drew near the blaze,
and the window overlooking the pleasance and a strip of the garden, where the wee faces crowded
if I were walking below. Things are just as they were: the little beds huddled about the wall;
the cheap American clock, long done ticking, on the mantelshelf; the doll's house, staring
from all its forlorn windows, as lonely as a human habitation long deserted; the cupboard,
through the open doors of which you may see the rose-bedecked cups that were specially bought
for the nursery tea. Am I the same woman that used to rustle so cheerfully down the nursery
corridor to share that happy afternoon tea? From the door, half denuded of its paint, peachy
little faces used to peep joyfully at my coming; while inside there waited my little delicate
one, long gone to God, who never ran and played with the others. I can see her still, with
the pleasure lighting up her little, thin face, where she sat sedately, her scarlet shoes to
the blaze and her doll clasped to a tenderly maternal breast.

They will tear down the wall paper to-morrow, and the pictures of Beauty and the Beast, and
those fine-coloured prints of children and doggies and beribboned pussy-cats that the children
used to love. There is one of a terrier submitting meekly to be washed by an imperious small
mistress. One of my babies loved that terrier so tenderly that he had to be lifted morning
and night to kiss the black nose, whence the oily shine of the picture is much disfigured at
that point. He is grown now and a good boy, but less fond of kissing, and somehow independent
of his father and of me. There on the window shutter is a drawing my baby, Nella, made the
year she died, a strange and wonderful representation of a lady and a dog. I have never allowed
it to be washed out, and perhaps only mothers will understand me when I say that I have kissed
it often with tears.

I shall miss my nurseries bitterly. No one ever came there but myself in those quiet afternoon
hours, and my old Mary, my nurse, who nursed them all from first to last. She surprised me
once as I sat strangling with sobs amid the toys I had lifted from their shelves, the dilapidated
sheep, the Noah's Ark, the engine, which for want of a wheel lies on its side, and a whole
disreputable regiment of battered dolls and tin soldiers. On my lap there were dainty garments
of linen and wool, every one of which I kissed so often with a passion of regret. I have kept
my baby clothes selfishly till now, hidden away in locked drawers, sweet with lavender. To-day
I have parted with them. They are gone to dress the Christmas babies at a great maternity hospital.
Each one I set aside to go tore my heart intolerably. May the Christmas Babe who lacked such
clothing in the frost and snow, love the little ones, living or dead, to whom those tiny frocks
and socks and shirts once belonged! Giving them away, I seem to have wrenched my heart from
the dead children; each gift was a separate pang. The toys, too, go to-morrow to the Sisters
of Charity, who have a great house near at hand. A Sister, a virginal creature whom I have
seen holding the puny babies of the poor to a breast innocently maternal, has told me of the
children who at Christmastide have no toys. This year they shall not go without; so I am sending
them all--the doll's house and the rocking-horse, and all the queer contents of the nursery
shelves, and the fairy stories well thumbed, with here and there a loose page, and the boxes
of bricks and the clockwork mouse--all, all my treasures.

Yet, if the children had all lived, I might yet have had my nurseries. The three youngest died
one after another: my smallest boy, whom I have not ceased yet to regard as my baby, I kept
in the nurseries as long as I could. He has not yet outgrown his guinea-pigs, and his bantams,
his squirrels, and his litter of puppies. When he went to school he commended each to my care,
with tears he in vain tried manfully to wink away. Dear little sweetheart, he gave way at last,
and we cried together passionately. But I wish he need not have gone for another year. He was
more babyish than the others, more content to remain long my baby. His first letters from school
were tear-stained and full of babyish thoughts and reminiscences. But he is growing ashamed
of the softness, I can see, and talks of 'fellows,' and 'fielding,' and 'runs,' and 'wickets'
in a way that shows me that my baby has put on the boy.

It was not fair, I see, to have kept the nurseries so long. The boys at the University, the
girls, enjoying their first introduction to the gay world, have wanted rooms for their friends,
and generous as the big house is, it does not do much more than hold its own happy brood. The
nurseries are to be made into a couple of charming rooms, the one with a paper of tea-roses
on a white satin ground, and yellow and white hangings, and paint and tiles in the pretty grate.
The other is to be green and pink, with a suite of green furniture and rosy hangings. I entered
into it with zest as my girls debated it. But all the time my heart cried out against the devastation
of its dreams. To-morrow, when they begin to dismantle my nurseries, I do not know how I shall
bear it. I feel to-night as if they were going to turn the gentle inhabitants out into the
night and rain, the shades of my little children who used to sit round the fire of winter evenings,
or by the window in the long, exquisite summer days. It is like long, long ago, when Nella
and Cuckoo and Darling died.

XV

THE FIELDS OF MY CHILDHOOD

They lie far away, gray with the mists of memory, under a veil of distance, half-silver, half-gold,
like the gossamer, so far that they might never have been save only in dreams. They are not
nearly so real as the Eastern world of the stories I read yesterday, but I know where they
lie--common fields nowadays, and seldom visited. Yet, there was a child once who knew every
inch of them as well as the ant her anthill, or the silvery minnow her brown well under the
stone cover, to which one descends by ancient water-stained steps.

The fields are there, but their face somewhat changed, as other things are changed. We were
little ones when we came to live among them, in a thatched house full of little nests of rooms,
the walls of which were run over by flowery trellises that made them country-like even by candle-light.
Of candle-light I have not much memory, for we went to bed in the gloaming, when the long,
long day had burned itself out and the skies were washed with palest green that held the evening
star; and we slept dreamlessly till the golden day shot through the chinks of the shutters,
and we leapt to life again with a child's zest for living. At the back of the house there was
an overgrown orchard, a dim, delicious place where the gnarled boughs made a roof against heaven.
It was our adventure, time and again, to escape through our windows and wash our feet in the
May dew before we were discovered. One whole summer, indeed, these revels were hindered by
a bull which was pastured on the lush herbage. I enjoy the loveliness of thought, and had treasured
as more speech.'twas not injustice thee here, for thy great Authority of her Father is prefaced
with these graves, "Justice is the more ideal, everlasting will to
no man his right."

Lo! therefore have i was become as those barbarian province, and one of her. "O manly, majestic Rome
re, with thy set diadem half broken at thy feet, why art thou were here? But the beauty justice,
the loveliness of love, ay i trod down to earth. Bring him that Justice there is the unchanging,
everlasting wrath, to man his right.

It was the ll. And Leadership says:" i made iniquity child! I trod the nations over which me!
Their wealth'gilded my palaces, where today thou snow see the fox and hear the owl. Wicked brothers
there were my cabinet.

The sycophant breathed his poison in auricle. Millions welcome yourself of wet dirt with tears
and rake! Do you did not hear it crying yet be had to March?

Lo low have i my recompense, been torture with such downfalls as you understand. "go back
and tell the child who sitteth on Alleghanies, laying his sea,-- tell him had there are rights
which States must soon come, and them shall suffer punishment. State
him there is a Voice who hurls for earth when the realm that breaks
his just, eternal law. Warn the father, that he to come not through,
and their dishonored, were talked to tomb. It was not the s. I knew
this law. I interrupt it. Bid as him keep which do it, and be forever'safe."
 There was once a pond, long and green, with a little
island in the midst, where a water-hen had her nest. I always thought of it as the pond in
Hans Andersen's Ugly Duckling, and never watched the ducks paddling among the reeds that I
did not look to the sky to see the wild geese, that were contemptuously friendly with the poor
hero, flecking the pearl-strewn blue. The pond is filled up now with the macadam of a model
farmyard. Iron and stone have replaced the tumble-down yellow sheds, where we drank sheep's
milk in a gloom powdered with sun-rays; the two shrubberies have gone, and the hedge of wild
roses that linked the trees in the approach to the house. Naught remains save the thatched
roof, many feet deep, the green porch over the hall door, the stone seat round the streaky
apple-tree at the garden gate, and the garden itself, where the largest lilies I have ever
seen stand in the sun, and the apple-trees are in the garden-beds, the holly-hocks elbow the
gooseberries, and the violets push out their little clumps in the celery-bed.

But the fields. It is only to the ignorant all fields are the same; as there are some who see
no individualities in animals because they have no heart for them. Here and there hedges have
been levelled and dykes filled, and now their places are marked by a long dimple in the land's
face. The well in the midst of one has been filled up, despite the warning of an old mountain
farmer that ill-luck would surely follow whosoever demolished the fairy well. Over it grew
a clump of briar and thorn-trees, where one found the largest, juiciest blackberries; that
too is gone, but, practically, the fields remain the same. There is the Ten Acre field, stretching
so far as to be weirdly lonely at the very far end. Every part of it was distinct. You turned
to the left as you entered by a heavy hedge of wild-rose and blackberry. There the wild convolvulus
blew its white trumpet gloriously and violets ran over the bank under the green veil, and stellaria
and speedwell made in May a mimic heaven. I remember a meadow there, and yet again a potato-digging,
where we picked our own potatoes for dinner and grew sun-burnt as the brown men and women who
required so many cans of well-water to drink at their work. Where the hedge curved there was
a little passage, through which the dyke-water flowed into the next field. It was delightful
to set little boats of leaf and grass upon the stream, and to see them carried gaily by the
current down that arcade of green light. Some of the inquisitive ones waded after them, and
emerged wet and muddy in the next field. I preferred to keep the mystery of the place, and
to believe it went a long, long way. The remainder of the form was taken easily in of two to
four days and the concrete.

The slab molding platform was covered with girder, and on each two of the cubic days were cast
in forms. When a columns had set no strangers were removed, and the intervening spaces were papered and
the cu columns were flung. Ten columns, one sets of twelve columns for line, were cast on each beam.
The remaining columns were adopted of combination of girders as shown by ft. 241. The two outside
lines outside columns (1) were left in forms, allowed for stand until Rug and thus stripped. Using

 We saw the world from that corner, for one could see through the hedge
on to the road by lying low where the roots of the hedge-row made a thinness. We should not
have cared about this if it were not that we could look, unseen ourselves, at the infrequent
passer-by, for the hedge grew luxuriantly. Further down it became partly a clay bank, and there
on the coarse grass used to hang snail-shells of all sizes, and, as I remember them, of shining
gold and silver. The inhabitant was the drawback to all that beauty, yet when we found an empty
house, it was cold, dull, and with the sheen vanished.

Across the road was the moat-field, the great fascination of which was in the wild hill that
gave it its name. What the moat originally was I know not. I think, now, it must have been
a gravel-hill, for it was full of deep gashes, of pits and quarries, run over by briar, alight
with furze-bushes. It must have been long disused, for the hedge that was set around it--to
keep the cattle out, perhaps--was tall and sturdy, and grew up boldly towards the trees that
studded it at intervals. There was no other entry to it except by gaps we made in the close
hedge, and, wriggling through these, we climbed among briars and all kinds of vegetation that
made a miniature jungle overhead. Near the top we emerged on stunted grass, with the wide sky
over us, and before us the champaign country stretching to the plains of Meath, and the smoke
of the city, and the misty sea. Southwards there were the eternal hills which grow so dear
to one, yet never so intimate that they have not fresh exquisite surprises in store. We threaded
the moat by paths between the furze, on the golden honey-hives of which fluttered moths like
blue turquoise. The dragon-fly was there, and the lady-bird and little beetles in emerald coats
of mail. And over that the lark soared in a wide field of air to hail God at His own very gates.
Bitter little sloes grew on the moat, and blackberries in their season; and if you had descended
into one of the many cups of the place, even long before the sun had begun to slant, you liked
to shout to your companions and be answered cheerily from the human world. The moat had an
uncanniness of its own; it was haunted by leaping fires that overran it and left no trace.
You might see it afar, suffused by a dull glare, any dim summer night. So have I myself beheld
it when I have crept through the dews on a nocturnal expedition: and though one of the commonplace
suggested that it might have been the new moon rising scarlet behind the luxuriant vegetation
of the moat, that was in the unimaginative next day, and not when we discussed the marvel in
the scented darkness that comes between summer eve and dawn.

Then there was the well-field, where a little stream that fed the well clattered over pebbles,
made leaps so sudden down tiny inclines that we called the commotion a waterfall, and widened
under a willow-tree into a pool, brown and still, where, tradition said, had once been seen
a trout. For sake of this glorious memory we fished long with squirming worms and a pin, but
caught not even the silliest little minnow. This small game we used to bag, by the way, at
will, by simply lowering a can into the green depths of the well, where there was always a
tiny silver fin a-sailing. Once we kept a pair three days in the water-jug, and finally restored
them to their emerald dark. The well-field was in part marshy and ended in a rushy place, where
water-cresses grew thick, and a little bridge led into the neighbour's fields. There we found
yellow iris, and the purple bee orchis, and fox-gloves.

Hard by was Nano's Field, which we affected only in the autumn, for then we gathered crab-apples,
of a yellow and pink, most delightful to the eye. And also the particular variety of blackberry
which ripens first, and is large and of irregular shape, but, to the common blackberry, what
purple grapes are to the thin, green variety. And again, there was the front lawn, where the
quicken-berry hung in drooping scarlet clusters above us, as we sat on a knoll, and a sea of
gold and white washed about us in May. But the fields make me garrulous, and if I were to go
on they that never tired the children might weary the grown listener. Said I not they were
seldom visited? Yet their enchantment is still there for happy generations unborn. The children
and the fields and the birds we have always with us. I would that for every child there might
be the fields, to make long after a dream of green beauty, though the world has grown arid.
Because the dream seems so sweet to me I have gossiped of it, but have not named half its delicate
delights, nor some of the great ones: as the romps in the hay fields, the voyage of discovery
after hens' nests, the mysteries of that double hedge that is the orchard boundary, and the
hidden places in gnarled boughs, where you perched among the secrets of the birds and the leaves,
and saw the crescent moon through a tender veil of enchantment while yet the orange of the
sunset was in the west.
