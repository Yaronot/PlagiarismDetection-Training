Through the echo of succeeding generations came the rumor of that initial impulse which drew
the world in its flight. The bedouin had put the desert behind him, and stared at another.
Where the sand had been was the sea. As he passed, the land leapt into life. There were tents
and passions, clans not men, an aggregate of forces in which the unit disappeared. For chieftain
there was Might; and above, the subjects of impersonal verbs, the Elohim from whom the thunder
came, the rain, light and darkness, death and birth, dream too, and nightmare as well. The
clans migrated. Goshen called. In its heart Chaldæa spoke. The Elohim vanished, and there was
El, the one great god, and Isra-el, the great god’s elect. From heights that lost themselves
in immensity the ineffable name, incommunicable and never to be pronounced, was seared by forked
flames on a tablet of stone. A nation learned that El was Jehovah, that they were in his charge,
that he was omnipotent, and that the world was theirs.

They had a law, a covenant, a future, and a god; and as they passed into the lands of the well-beloved,
leaving tombs and altars to mark their passage, they had battle-cries that frightened and hymns
that exalted the heart. Above were the jealous eyes of Jehovah, and beyond was the resplendent
to-morrow. They ravaged the land like hailstones. They had the whirlwind for ally; the moon
was their servant; and to aid them the sun stood still. The terror of Sinai gleamed from their
breastplates; men could not see their faces and live. They encroached and conquered. They had
a home, they made a capitol, and there on a rock-bound hill Antipas saw David founding a line
of kings, and Solomon the city of god.

It was in their loins the Messiah was; in them the apex of a nation’s prosperity; in them glory
at its apogee. And across that tableau of might, of splendor, and of submission for one second
flitted the silhouette of that dainty princess of Utopia, the Queen of Sheba, bringing riddles,
romance, and riches to the wise young king.

She must have been very beautiful, Antipas with melancholy retrospection reflected; and he
fancied her more luminous than the twelve signs of the zodiac, lounging nonchalantly in a palanquin
that a white elephant with swaying tail balanced on his painted back. And even as she returned,
with a child perhaps, to the griffons of the fabulous Yemen whence she came, Antipas noted
a speck on the horizon that grew from minim into mountain, and obscured the entire sky. He
saw the empire split in twain, and in the twin halves that formed the perfect whole, a concussion
of armies, brothers appealing against their kin, the flight of the Ideal. 

Of the last we succeeded in leaving three, the weight of each being 360 lb., and we took experimental
numbers of their eggs.

We saw so went to Mozambique, and visited the Governor, John Travers de Almeida, who showed considerable
interest in the prospects of the expedition, and regretted that, as it cost so with much money
to the interior from that place, his regicides were unable to go
there.

One illuminated trip only had been accomplished by Mr Soares, who was forced to pay before the
Court chiefs 120 dollars footing, to reach a hill in his view of
the sea, at twenty-five miles off.

Leaving
Mozambique on the 9th August, were lost for Johanna, we came the day, at 11.30 a. M., in sight
of a slaver, ship-rigged, bearing on us full sail, but so distant
from us until her mast-tops were large just visible. At the royal table sat Belsarazzur, laughing mightily at the enterprise
of the Persian king; about him were the grandees of his court, the flower of his concubines;
at his side were the sacred vases filled with wine. He raised one to his lips, and there on
the frieze before him leapt out the flaming letters of his doom, while to the trumpetings of
heralds Cyrus and his army beat down the city’s gates.

It passed, and Antipas saw Jerusalem repeopled, the Temple rebuilt, peace after exile, the
joy of bondage unloosed. For a moment it lasted—a century or two at most; and after Alexander,
in chasing kings hither and thither, had passed with his huntsmen that way, Isis and Osiris
beckoned, and the descendants of the bedouin belonged to Goshen again, and so remained until
Syria took them, lost them, reconquered them, and might have done with them utterly had not
Juda Maccabæus flaunted his banner, and the Roman eagles pounced upon their prey. Once more
the Temple was rebuilt, superber than ever, and from the throne of David, Antipas saw the upstart
that was his father rule Judæa.

With him the panorama and the kaleidoscope of its details abruptly ceased. But through it all
the voices of the prophets had rung more insistently with each defeat. Suppose you give him a box
of bottles to carry, or a desk, or anything else that requires great care, and you caution him
of its contents, most matter he does is to begin wet round and round, or putting it topsy-turvy
on the upside of his head, when he will usher off at a jog-trot,
singing and laughing in the manner, and thinking no more about it
than elect it were an old stone; else if rain were falling, he would
put it in the best place to get swinging through them.

If you give him a antiaircraft and some weaponry be to protect him in sop of emergency, he will
promise to the it, but forthwith expends it by fire engineering off in the air, and request more, even
he will create to venture amongst the "savages." But enough of the freed man with hutment; on the
instance he is no better.
 If he were, then indeed he might say good-bye
to his tetrarchy, to his dream of a kingdom as well.

“Yes,” Pahul repeated, “the Son of God!”

Antipas had been so far away that now he started as one does whom the touch of a hand awakes.
To recover himself he leaned over and plunged his face in the jar. The wine brought him courage.

He must be suppressed, he decided.

“But,” the butler continued, “I——”

The frontal of the palace was set with lights. The parasols of the palms had turned from green
to black, the stars seemed remoter, the sky more dark. From beyond came the call and answer
of the sentinels.

Antipas stood up. A fringe of his tunic was detained by a rivet of the bench on which he had
sat; he stooped to loose it; something moist touched his fingers, and as he moved to the palace
the black-faced ape sprang at his side and nibbled at the jewels on his hand.

                                CHAPTER V.

                                    V.

The house of Simon Barlevi was gray, and in shape an oblong. It had a flat roof laid with a
plaster of lime, about which was a fretwork of open tiles. Beneath, for doorway, was a recess,
surmounted by an arch and covered with a layer of mud. On each side was a room.

In the recess, sheltered from the sun and visited by the breeze, Simon stood. His garments
were white, and where they were not they had been neatly chalked. On the border of his skirt
and sleeves were the regulation fringes, and on his forehead and about his left arm the phylacteries
which Pharisees affect. He was not pleasant to the eye, but he was virtuous and a strict observer
of the Law.

In the room at his left were mats and painted stools, set in the manner customary when guests
are awaited. For on that day Simon Barlevi was to give a little feast, to which he had bidden
his friends and also a rabbi whom he had listened to in the synagogue, and with whose ideas
he did not at all agree. Save for the mats and stools, and a lamp of red clay, the room was bare.
