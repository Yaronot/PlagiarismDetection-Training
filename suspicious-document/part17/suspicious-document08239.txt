If each franc insured pays so many centimes insurance premium, each franc of manual gain and
of salary should pay as many centimes as each franc of industrial or commercial gain, also
as each franc of personal or land revenue; that is to say, more than one-fifth of a franc,
or 21 centimes.--At this rate, the workman who lives on his own labor, the day-laborer, the
journeyman who earns 1 franc 15 centimes per day and who works 300 days of the year, ought
to pay out of his 345 francs wages 69 francs to the public treasury. At this rate; the ordinary
peasant or cultivator of his own field, owner of a cottage and a small tract of ground which
he might rent at 100 francs a year, should pay into the public treasury, out of his land income
and from manual labor, 89 francs.[3227] The deduction, accordingly, on such small earnings
would be enormous; for this gain, earned from day to day, is just enough to live on, and very
poorly, for a man and his family: were it cut down one-fifth he and his family would be obliged
to fast; he would be nothing but a serf or half-serf, exploited by the exchequer, his seignior
and his proprietor. Because the exchequer, as formerly the proprietary seigniors, would appropriate
to itself 60 days of labor out of the 300. Such was the condition of many millions of men,
the great majority of Frenchmen, under the ancient Régime. Indeed, the five direct taxes, the
taille, its accessories, the road-tax, the capitatim and the vingtièmes, were a tax on the
taxpayer, not only according to the net revenue of his property, if he had any, but again and
especially "of his faculties" and presumed resources whatever these might be, comprising his
manual earnings or daily wages.--Consequently, "a poor laborer owning nothing,"[3228] who earned
19 sous a day, or 270 livres a year,[3229] was taxed 18 or 20 livres. Out of 300 days' work
there were 20 or 22 which belonged beforehand to the public treasury.--Three-fifths[3230] of
the French people were in this situation, and the inevitable consequences of such a fiscal
system have been seen--the excess of extortions and of suffering, the spoliation, privations
and deep-seated resentment of the humble and the poor. Every government is bound to care for
these, if not from compassion, at least through prudential considerations, and this one more
than any other, since it is founded on the will of the greatest number, on the repeated votes
of majorities counted by heads.

To this end, it establishes two divisions of direct taxation: one, the real-estate tax, which
has no bearing on the taxpayer without any property; and the other, the personal tax, which
does affect him, but lightly: calculated on the rate of rent, it is insignificant on an attic,
furnished lodging, hut or any other hovel belonging to a laborer or peasant; again, when very
poor or indigent, if the octroi is burdensome, the exchequer sooner or later relieves them;
add to this the poll-tax which takes from them 1 franc and a half up to 4.50 francs per annum,
also a very small tax on doors and windows, say 60 centimes per annum in the villages on a
tenement with only one door and one window, and, in the towns, from 60 to 75 centimes per annum
for one room above the second story with but one window.[3231] In this way, the old tax which
was crushing becomes light: instead of paying 18 or 20 livres for his taille, capitatim and
the rest, the journeyman or the artisan with no property pays no more than 6 or 7 francs;[3232]
instead of paying 53 livres for his vingtièmes for his poll, real and industrial tax, his capitatim
and the rest, the small cultivator and owner pays no more than 21 francs. Through this reduction
of their fiscal charges (corvée) and through the augmentation of their day wages, poor people,
or those badly off, who depended on the hard and steady labor of their hands, the plowmen,
masons, carpenters, weavers, blacksmiths, wheelwrights and porters, every hired man and artisan,
in short, all the laborious and tough hands, again became almost free; these formerly owed,
out of their 300 working days, from 20 to 59 to the exchequer; they now owe only from 6 to
19,[3233] and thus gain from 14 to 40 free days during which, instead of working for the exchequer,
they work for themselves.--The reader may estimate the value to a small household of such an
alleviation of the burden of discomfort and care.

IV. Various Taxes.

     Other direct taxes.--Tax on business licenses.--Tax on
     real-estate transactions.--The earnings of manual labor almost
     exempt from direct taxation.--Compensation on another side.
     --Indirect taxation.--In what respect the new machinery is
     superior to the old.--Summary effect of the new fiscal
     régime.--Increased receipts of the public treasury.--Lighter
     burdens of the taxpayer.--Change in the condition of the
     small taxpayer.

This infraction of the principle of distributive justice is in favor of the poor. Through the
almost complete exemption of those who have no property the burden of direct taxation falls
almost entirely on those who own property. If they are manufacturers, or in commerce, they
support still another burden, that of the license tax, which is a supplementary impost proportioned
to their probable gains.[3234] Finally, to all these annual and extra taxes, levied on the
probable or certain income derived from invested or floating capital, the exchequer adds an
eventual tax on capital itself, consisting of the mutation tax, assessed on property every
time it changes hands through gift, inheritance or by contract, obtaining its title under free
donation or by sale, and which tax, aggravated by the timbre,[3235] is enormous[3236] since,
in most cases, it takes 5, 7, 9, and up to 10 1/2 % on the capital transmitted, that is to
say, in the case of real-estate, 2, 3 and even 4 years' income from it. Thus, in the first
shearing of the sheep the exchequer cuts deep, as deep as possible; but it has sheared only
the sheep whose fleece is more or less ample; its scissors have scarcely touched the others,
much more numerous, whose wool, short, thin and scant, is maintained only by day-wages, the
petty gains of manual labor.--Compensation is to come when the exchequer, resuming its scissors,
shears the second time: it is the indirect tax which, although properly levied and properly
collected, is, in its nature, more burdensome for the poor than for the rich and well-off.

Through this tax, and through to the previous action of customs-duties, tolls, octrois or monopolies,
the State collects a certain percentage on the price of various kinds of merchandise sold.
In this way it participates in trade and commerce and itself becomes a merchant. It knows,
therefore, like all able merchants, that, to obtain large profits, it must sell large quantities,
that it must have a very large body of customers, that the largest body is that which ensures
to it and embraces all its subjects, in short, that its customers must consist not only of
the rich, who number merely tens of thousands, not only the well-to-do, who number merely hundreds
of thousands, but likewise the poor and the half-poor, who number millions and tens of millions.
Hence, in the merchandise by the sale of which it is to profit, it takes care to include staple
articles which everybody needs, for example, salt, sugar, tobacco and beverages in universal
and popular use. This accomplished, let us follow out the consequences, and look in at the
shops over the whole surface of the territory, in the towns or in the villages, where these
articles are disposed of. Daily and all day long, consumers abound; their large coppers and
small change constantly rattle on the counter; and out of every large copper and every small
piece of silver the national treasury gets so many centimes: that is its share, and it is very
sure of it, for it is already in hand, having received it in advance. At the end of the year,
these countless centimes fill its cash-box with millions, as many and more millions than it
gathers through direct taxation.

And this second crop causes less trouble than the first one for the taxpayer who is subject
to it has less trouble and like-wise the State which collects it.--In the first place, the
tax-payer suffers less. In relation to the exchequer, he is no longer a mere debtor, obliged
to pay over a particular sum at a particular date; his payments are optional; neither the date
nor the sum are fixed; he pays on buying and in proportion to what he buys, that is to say,
when he pleases and as little as he wants. He is free to choose his time, to wait until his
purse is not so empty; there is nothing to hinder him from thinking before he enters the shop,
from counting his coppers and small change, from giving the preference to more urgent expenditure,
from reducing his consumption. If he is not a frequenter of the cabaret, his quota, in the
hundreds of millions of francs obtained from beverages, is almost nothing; if he does not smoke
or snuff, his quota, in the hundreds of millions derived from the tax on tobacco, is nothing
at all; because he is economical, prudent, a good provider for his family and capable of self-sacrifice
for those belonging to him, he escapes the shearing of the exchequer. Moreover, when he does
come under the scissors, these hardly graze his skin; so long as tariff regulations and monopolies
levy nothing on articles which are physically indispensable to him, as on bread in France,
indirect taxation does not touch his flesh. In general, fiscal or protective duties, especially
those which increase the price of tobacco, coffee, sugar, and beverages, do not affect his
daily life, but merely deprive him of some of its pleasures and comforts.--And, on the other
hand, in the collection of these duties, the exchequer may not show its hand; if it does its
business properly, the anterior and partial operation is lost sight of in the total operation
which completes and covers this up; it screens itself behind the merchant. The shears are invisible
to the buyer who presents himself to be sheared; in any event, he has no distinct sensation
of them. Now, with the man of the people, the common run of sheep, it is the positive, actual,
animal sensation which is the cause of his cries, his convulsive shudders, and contagious alarms
and panics. As long as he is not being excited he can be manipulated; at the utmost, he grumbles
at the hard times; the high prices from which he suffers are not imputed to the government;
he does not know how to reckon, check off and consider for himself the surplus price which
the fiscal impost extorts from him. Even at the present day, one might tell a peasant in vain
that the State takes fifteen out of the forty sous which he pays for a pound of coffee, and
five centimes out of every two sous he pays for a pound of salt; for him, this is simply a
barren notion, a vague calculation at random; the impression on his mind would be very different
if, standing before the grocer who weighs out his coffee and salt, he saw with his own eyes,
right before him, the clerk of the customs and of the salt-tax actually taking the fifteen
sous and the five centimes off the counter.

Such are the good indirect taxes: in order that they may be correct, that is to say, tolerable
and tolerated, three conditions, as we see, are requisite. In the first place, the taxpayer,
in his own interest, must be free to buy or not to buy the merchandise taxed. Next, in the
interest of the taxpayer and of the exchequer, the merchandise must not be so taxed as to be
rendered too dear. After that, in the interest of the exchequer, its interference must not
be perceptible. Owing to these precautions, indirect taxes can be levied, even on the smaller
taxpayers, without either fleecing or irritating them. It is for lack of these precautions
before 1789, when people were fleeced in such a clumsy way,[3237] that, in 1789, they first
rebelled against indirect taxation,[3238] against the meal-tax, the salt-tax, the tax on liquors,
the internal tariffs, and the town octrois, against fiscal officers, bureaux and registries,
by murdering, pillaging, and burning, beginning in the month of March in Provence and after
the 13th of July in Paris, and then throughout France, with such a universal, determined and
persistent hostility that the National Assembly, after having vainly attempted to restore the
suspended tax-levies and enforce the law on the populace, ended in subjecting the law to the
populace and in decreeing the suppression of indirect taxation entirely.[3239]

Such, in the matter of taxation, is the work of the Revolution. Of the two sources which, through
their regular afflux, fill the public Treasury, and of which the ancient Régime took possession
and managed badly, violently, through loose and bungling measures, it has nearly dried up the
first one, direct taxation, and completely exhausted the second one, indirect taxation. At
present, as the empty Treasury must be filled, the latter must be taken in hand the same as
the former, its waters newly gathered in and gently conducted without loss. The new government
sets about this, not like the old one, in a rude, conventional manner, but as an engineer and
calculator who knows the ground, its inclination and other obstacles, in short, who comprehends
human sensibility and the popular imagination.[3240]--And, first of all, there is to be no
more farming-out (of the collection of the revenues): the State no longer sells its duties
on salt or on beverages to a company of speculators, mere contractors, who care for nothing
but their temporary lease and annual incomes, solely concerned with coming dividends, bleeding
the tax-payer like so many leeches and invited to suck him freely, interested in multiplying
affidavits by the fines they get, and creating infractions, authorized by a needy government
which, supporting itself on their advances, places the public force at their disposal and surrenders
the people to their exactions. Henceforth, the exchequer collects for itself and for its own
account. It is the same as a proprietor who, instead of leasing or renting out, improves his
property and becomes his own farmer. The State, therefore, considers the future in its own
interest; it limits the receipts of the current year so as not to compromise the receipts of
coming years; it avoids ruining the present tax-payer who is also the future taxpayer; it does
not indulge in gratuitous chicanery, in expensive lawsuits, in warrants of execution and imprisonment;
it is averse to converting a profitable laborer into a beggar who brings in nothing, or into
a prisoner for debt who costs it something. Through this course, the relief is immense; ten
years previous to the Revolution,[3241] it was estimated that, in principal and in accessories,
especially in costs of collection and in fines, indirect taxation cost the nation twice as
much the king derived from it, that it paid 371 millions to enable him to receive 184 millions,
that the salt-tax alone took out of the pockets of the taxpayer 100 millions for 45 millions
deposited in his coffers. Under the new government, fines became rarer; seizures, executions
and sales of personal property still rarer, while the costs of collection, reduced by increasing
consumption, are not to exceed one-twentieth in-stead of one-fifth of the receipts.[3242]--In
the second place, the consumer becomes free again, in law as in fact, not to purchase taxed
goods. He is no longer constrained, as formerly, in the provinces subject to high salt-tax,
to accept, consume, and pay for duty-salt, 7 pounds per head at 13 sous the pound. Provincial,
town or seignorial taxes on Bread, a commodity which he cannot do without, no longer exist;
there is no piquet, or duty on flour, as in Provence,[3243] no duties on the sale or of grinding
wheat, no impediments to the circulation or commerce of grain. And, on the other hand, through
the lowering of fiscal charges, in the suppression of internal duties, and the abolition of
multitudinous tolls, other commodities, apart from bread reached by a different tax, now becomes
affordable for those of small means. Salt, instead of costing thirteen sous and over, no longer
costs more than two sous the pound. A cask of Bordeaux wine no longer pays two hundred livres
before it is retailed by the tavern-keeper at Rennes.[3244] Except in Paris, and even at Paris,
so long as the extravagance of municipal expenditure does not increase the octroi the total
tax on wine, cider and beer does not add, even at retail, more than 18 % to their selling price,[3245]
while, throughout France, the vine-grower, or the wine-maker, who gathers in and manufactures
his own wine, drinks this and even his brandy, without paying one cent of tax under this heading.[3246]--Consequently,
consumption increases, and, as there are no longer any exempt or half-exempt provinces, no
more free salt (franc salé),[3247] no more privileges arising from birth, condition, profession
or residence, the Treasury, with fewer duties, collected or gained as much as before the Revolution:
In 1809 and 1810, 20 millions on tobacco, 54 millions on salt, 100 millions on liquors, and
then, as the taxpayer became richer and spent more, still larger and larger sums: in 1884,
305 millions on tobacco: in 1885, 429 millions on liquors,[3248] without counting another 100
millions again raised on liquors through town octrois.--And lastly, the exchequer, with extreme
prudence, keeps out of sight and succeeds in almost saving the taxpayer from contact with,
or the presence of, its agents. There is an end to a domestic inquisition. The excise man no
longer pounces in on the housewife to taste the pickle, to find out whether the ham has been
cured with bogus salt, to certify that all the dutiable salt has been used in "the pot and
the salt-cellar." The wine-inspector no longer comes suddenly on the wine-grower, or even on
the consumer, to gauge his casks, to demand an account of what he drinks, to make an affidavit
in case of deficit or over-consumption, to impose a fine should a bottle have been given to
a sick person or to a poor one. The 50,000 customs officers or clerks of the ferme, the 23,000
soldiers without a uniform who, posted in the interior along a line of 1200 leagues, guarded
the heavily taxed salt districts against the provinces which were less taxed, redeemed or free,
the innumerable employees at the barriers, forming a confused and complicated band around each
province, town, district or canton, levying on twenty or thirty different sorts of merchandise
forty-five principal duties, general, provincial, or municipal, and nearly sixteen hundred
tolls, in short, the entire body of officials of the old system of indirect taxation has almost
wholly disappeared. Save at the entrance of towns, and for the octroi the eye no longer encounters
an official clerk. The carters who, from Roussillon or Languedoc, transport a cask of wine
to Paris, are no longer subject to his levies, humiliations and moods in twenty different places,
nor to ascribe to him the dozen or fifteen days' useless extension of their trip due to his
predecessor, and during which they had to wait in his office until he wrote a receipt or a
permit. There is scarcely any one now but the inn-keeper who sees his green uniform on his
premises. After the abolition of the house-inventory, nearly two millions of proprietors and
wine métayers are forever free of his visits;[3249] from now on, for consumers, especially
for the people, he seems absent and non existent. In effect, he has been transferred one or
two hundred leagues off, to the salt-establishments in the interior and on the coasts, and
on the frontier. There only is the system at fault, nakedly exposing its vice,--a war against
exchanges, the proscription of international commerce, prohibition pushed to extreme, the continental
blockade, an inquisition of 20,000 customs officials, the hostility of 100,000 defrauders,
the brutal destruction of seized goods, an augmentation in price of 100 % on cottons and 400%
on sugar, a dearth of colonial articles, privation to the consumer, the ruin of the manufacturer
and trader, and accumulated bankruptcies one after the other in 1811 in all the large towns
from Hamburg to Rome.[3250] This vice, however, belongs to the militant policy and personal
character of the master; the error that taints the external side of his fiscal system does
not reach the internal side. After him, under pacific reigns, it is gradually modified; prohibition
gives way to protection and then changes from excessive protection to limited protection. France
remains, along with secondary improvements and partial amendments, on the course marked out
by the Consulate and the Empire; this course, in all its main lines, is clearly traced, straight,
and yet adapted to all things, by the plurality, establishment, distribution, rate of taxation
and returns of the various direct and indirect taxes, nearly in conformity with the new principles
of political economy, as well as in conformity with the ancient maxims of distributive justice,
carefully directed between the two important interests that have to be cared for, that of the
people who pays and of the State which collects.

Consider, in effect, what both have gained.--In 1789, the State had a revenue of only 475 millions;
afterwards, during the Revolution, it scarcely collected any of its revenues; it lived on the
capital it stole, like a genuine brigand, or on the debts it contracted, like a dishonest and
insolvent bankrupt. Under the Consulate and during the first years of the Empire, its revenue
amounts to 750 to 800 millions, its subjects being no longer robbed of their capital, while
it no longer runs in debt.--In 1789, the ordinary taxpayer paid a direct tax to his three former
or late sovereigns, namely, to the King, the clergy and the seigniors, more than three-quarters
of his net income. After 1800, he pays to the State less than one-quarter, the one sovereign
alone who replaces the other three. We have seen how relief came to the old taxable subject,
to the rural, to the small proprietor, to the man without any property, who lived on the labor
of his own hands; the lightening of the direct tax restored to him from 14 to 43 free days,
during which, instead of working for the exchequer, he worked for himself. If married, and
the father of two children over 7 years of age, the alleviation of one direct tax alone, that
of the salt-tax, again restores to him 12 days more, in all from one to two complete months
each year during which he is no longer, as formerly, a man doing statute-work, but the free
proprietor, the absolute master of his time and of his own hands.--At the same time, through
the re-casting of other taxes and owing to the increasing price of labor, his physical privations
decrease. He is no longer reduced to consuming only the refuse of his crop, the wheat of poor
quality, the damaged rye, the badly-bolted flour mixed with bran, nor to drink water poured
over the lees of his grapes, nor to sell his pigs before Christmas because the salt he needs
is too dear.[3251] He salts his pork and eats it, and likewise butcher's meat; he enjoys his
boiled beef and broth on Sunday; he drinks wine; his bread is more nutritious, not so black
and healthier; he no longer lacks it and has no fear of lacking it. Formerly, he entertained
a lugubrious phantom, the fatal image of famine which haunted him day and night for centuries,
an almost periodical famine under the monarchy, a chronic famine and then severe and excruciating
during the Revolution, a famine which, under the republic, had in three years destroyed over
a million of lives.[3252] The immemorial specter recedes and vanishes; after two accidental
and local recurrences, in 1812 and 1817, it never again appears in France.[3253]

V. Conscription or Professional soldiers.

     Military service.--Under the Ancient Regime.--The militia
     and regular troops.--Number of soldiers.--Quality of the
     recruits.--Advantages of the institution.--Results of the
     new system.--The obligation universal.--Comparison between
     the burdens of citizens and subjects.--The Conscription
     under Napoleon.--He lightens and then increases its weight.
     --What it became after him.--The law of 1818.

One tax remains, and the last, that by which the State takes, no longer money, but the person
himself, the entire man, soul and body, and for the best years of his life, namely military
service. It is the Revolution which has rendered this so burdensome; formerly, it was light,
for, in principle, it was voluntary. The militia, alone, was raised by force, and, in general,
among the country people; the peasants furnished men for it by casting lots.[3254] But it was
simply a supplement to the active army, a territorial and provincial reserve, a distinct, sedentary
body of reinforcements and of inferior rank which, except in case of war, never marched; it
turned out but nine days of the year, and, after 1778, never turned out again. In 1789, it
comprised in all 72,260 men, and for eleven years their names, inscribed on the registers,
alone constituted their presence in the ranks.[3255] There were no other conscripts under the
monarchy; in this matter, its exactions were not great, ten times less than those of the Republic
and of the Empire, since both the Republic and the Empire, using the same constraint, were
to levy more than ten times the number of drafted men or conscripts.[3256]

Alongside of this militia body, the entire army properly so called, the "regular" troops were,
under, the ancient Régime, all recruited by free enlistment, not only the twenty-five foreign
regiments, Swiss, Irish, Germans, and Liégeois, but again the hundred and forty-five French
regiments, 177 000 men.[3257] The enlistment, indeed, was not free enough; frequently, through
the maneuvers of the recruiting-agent, it was tainted with inveigling and surprises, and sometimes
with fraud or violence; but, owing to the remonstrances due to the prevailing philanthropic
spirit, these abuses had diminished; the law of 1788 had suppressed the most serious of them
and, even with its abuses, the institution had two great advantages.--The army, in the first
place, served as an issue: through it the social body purged itself of its bad humors, of its
overheated or vitiated blood. At this date, although the profession of soldier was one of the
lowest and least esteemed, a barren career, without promotion and almost without escape, a
recruit was obtainable for about one hundred francs bounty and a "tip"; add to this two or
three days and nights of revel in the grog-shop, which indicates the kind and quality of the
recruits; in fact, very few could be obtained except among men more or less disqualified for
civil and domestic life, incapable of spontaneous discipline and of steady labor, adventurers
and outcasts, half-savage or half-blackguard, some of them sons of respectable parents thrown
into the army in an angry fit, and others again, regular vagabonds picked up in beggars' haunts,
mostly stray workmen and loafers, in short, "the most debauched, the most hot-brained, the
most turbulent people in an ardent, turbulent and somewhat debauched community."[3258] In this
way, the anti-social class was utilized for the public good. Let the reader imagine an ill-kept
domain overrun by a lot of stray curs that might prove dangerous: they are enticed and caught;
a collar, with a chain attached to it, is put on their necks and they become good watch-dogs.--In
the second place, this institution preserved to the subject the first and most precious of
all liberties, the full possession and the unrestricted management of one's own person, the
complete mastery of body and being. This was assured to him, guaranteed to him against the
encroachments of the State. It was better guaranteed than by the wisest constitution, for the
institution was a recognized custom accepted by everybody. In other words, it was a tacit,
immemorial convention,[3259] between the subject and the State, proclaiming that, if the State
had a right to draw on purses it had no right to draft persons: in reality and in fact, the
King, in his principal function, was merely a contractor like any other; he undertook natural
defense and public security the same as others undertook cleaning the streets or the maintenance
of a dike. It was his business to hire military workmen as they hired their civil workmen,
by mutual agreement, at an understood price and at current market rates. Accordingly, the sub-contractors
with whom he treated, the colonel and captains of each regiment, were subject as he was to
the law of supply and demand; he allowed them so much for each recruit,[3260] to replace those
dropped out, and they agreed to keep their companies full. They were obliged to procure men
at their own risk and at their own expense, while the recruiting-agent whom they dispatched
with a bag of money among the taverns, enlisted artillerymen, horsemen or foot-soldiers, after
bargaining with them, the same as one would hire men to sweep or pave the street and to clean
the sewers.

Against this practice and this principle comes the theory of the Contrat-Social. It declares
that the people are sovereign. Now, in this divided Europe, where a conflict between rival
States is always imminent, sovereigns are military men; they are such by birth, education,
and profession, and by necessity; the title carries along with it and involves the function.
Consequently, the subject, in assuming their rights, imposes upon himself their duties; in
his quota (of responsibility) he, in his turn, is sovereign; but, in his turn and in his person,
he is a soldier.[3261] Henceforth, if he is born an elector, he is born a conscript; he has
contracted an obligation of a new species and of infinite reach; the State, which formerly
had a claim only on his possessions, now has one on his entire body; never does a creditor
let his claims rest and the State always finds reasons or pretexts to enforce its claims. Under
the threats or trials of invasion the people, at first, had consented to pay this one; they
regarded it as accidental and temporary. After victory and when peace came, its government
continues to enforce the claim; it becomes settled and permanent. After the treaties of Luneville
and Amiens, Napoleon maintains it in France; after the treaties of Paris and Vienna, the Prussian
government is to maintain it in Prussia. One war after another and the institution becomes
worse and worse; like a contagion, it has spread from State to State. At the present time,
it has overspread the whole of continental Europe and here it reigns along with its natural
companion which always precedes or follows it, its twin-brother, universal suffrage. Each more
or less conspicuously "trotted out" and dragging the other along, more or less incomplete and
disguised, both being the blind and formidable leaders or regulators of future history, one
thrusting a ballot into the hands of every adult, and the other putting a soldier's knapsack
on every adult's back:

* with what promises of massacre and bankruptcy for the twentieth century,

* with what exasperation of international rancor and distrust,

* with what waste of human labor,

* through what perversion of productive discoveries,

* through what perfection of destructive appliances,

* through what a recoil to the lower and most unwholesome forms of old militant societies,

* through what retrograde steps towards brutal and selfish instincts,

* towards the sentiments, habits and morality of the antique city and of the barbarous tribe

is only too well known.[3262] It is sufficient for us to place the two military systems face
to face, that of former times and that of to-day: formerly, in Europe, a few soldiers, some
hundreds of thousands; to-day, in Europe, 18 millions of actual or eventual soldiers, all the
adults, even the married, even fathers of families summoned or subject to call for twenty-five
years of their life, that is to say, as long as they continue able-bodied men; formerly, for
the heaviest part of the service in France, no lives are confiscated by decree, only those
bought by contract, and lives suited to this business and elsewhere idle or mischievous; about
one hundred and fifty thousand lives of inferior quality, of mediocre value, which the State
could expend with less regret than others, and the sacrifice of which is not a serious injury
to society or to civilization. To-day, for the same service in France, 4 millions of lives
are taken by authority, and, if they attempt to escape, taken by force; all of them, from the
twentieth year onward, employed in the same manual and murderous pursuit, including the least
suited to the purpose and the best adapted to other purposes, including the most inventive
and the most fecund, the most delicate and the most cultivated, those remarkable for superior
talent (Page 232/526)who are of almost infinite social value, and whose forced collapse, or
precocious end, is a calamity for the human species.

Such is the terminal fruit of the new Régime; military duty is here the counterpart, and as
it were, the ransom of political right; the modern citizen may balance one with the other like
two weights in the scale. On the one side, he may place his prerogative as sovereign, that
is to say, in point of fact, the faculty every four years of giving one vote among ten thousand
for the election or non-election of one deputy among six hundred and fifty; on the other side,
he may place his positive, active service, three, four or five years of barrack life and of
passive obedience, and then twenty-eight days more, then a thirteen-days' summons in honor
of the flag, and, for twenty years, at each rumor of war, anxiously waiting for the word of
command which obliges him to shoulder his gun and slay with his own hand, or be slain. He will
probably end by discovering that the two sides of the scales do not balance and that a right
so hollow is poor compensation for so heavy a burden.

Of course, in 1789, he foresaw nothing like that; he was optimistic, pacific, liberal, humanitarian;
he knew nothing of Europe nor of history, nothing of the past nor of the present. When the
Constituent Assembly constituted him a sovereign, he let things go on; he did not know what
he engaged to do, he had no idea of having allowed such a heavy claim against him. But, in
signing the social contract, he made himself responsible; in 1793, the note came due and the
Convention collected it.[3263] Then comes Napoleon who put things in order. Henceforth, every
male, able-bodied adult must pay the debt of blood; no more exemptions in the way of military
service:[3264] all young men who had reached the required age drew lots in the conscription
and set out in turn according to the order fixed by their drafted number.[3265] But Napoleon
is an intelligent creditor; he knows that this debt is "most frightful and most detestable
for families," that his debtors are real, living men and therefore different in kind, that
the head of the State should keep these differences in mind, that is to say their condition,
their education, their sensibility and their vocation; that, not only in their private interest,
but again in the interest of the public, not merely through prudence but also through equity,
all should not be indistinguishably restricted to the same mechanical pursuit, to the same
manual labor, to the same prolonged and indefinite servitude of soul and body. Already, under
the Directory, the law had exempted young married men and widowers or divorced persons who
were fathers.[3266] Napoleon also exempts the conscript who has a brother in the active army,
the only son of a widow, the eldest of three orphans, the son of a father seventy-one years
old dependent on his labor, all of whom are family supports. He joins with these all young
men who enlist in one of his civil militias, in his ecclesiastical militia or in his university
militia, pupils of the École Normale, ignorantin brothers, seminarians for the priesthood,
on condition that they shall engage to do service in their vocation and do it effectively,
some for ten years, others for life, subject to a discipline more rigid, or nearly as rigid,
as military discipline.[3267] Finally, he sanctions or institutes volunteer substitutes, through
private agreement between a conscript and the able-bodied, certified volunteer substitute for
whom the conscript is responsible.[3268] If such a bargain is made between them it is done
freely, knowing what they are about, and because each man finds the exchange to his advantage;
the State has no right to deprive either of them uselessly of this advantage, and oppose an
exchange by which it does not suffer. So far from suffering it often gains by it. For, what
it needs is not this or that man, Peter or Paul, but a man as capable as Peter or Paul of firing
a gun, of marching long distances, of resisting inclemencies, and such are the substitutes
it accepts. They must all be[3269] "of sound health and robust constitution," and sufficiently
tall; as a matter of fact, being poorer than those replaced, they are more accustomed to privation
and fatigue; most of them, having reached maturity, are worth more for the service than youths
who have been recruited by anticipation and too young; some are old soldiers: and in this case
the substitute is worth twice as much as the new conscript who has never donned the knapsack
or bivouacked in the open air. Consequently, those who are allowed to obtain substitutes are
"the drafted and conscripts of all classes,... unable to endure the fatigues of war, and those
who shall be recognized of greater use to the State by continuing their labors and studies
than in forming a part of the army...."[3270]

Napoleon had too much sense to be led by the blind existences of democratic formulae; his eyes,
which penetrated beyond mere words, at once perceived that the life of a simple soldier, for
a young man well brought up and a peasant or for day-laborer, is unequal. A tolerable bed,
sufficient clothing, good shoes, certainty of daily bread, a piece of meat regularly, are novelties
for the latter but not for the former, and, consequently, enjoyments; that the promiscuity
and odor of the barrack chamber, the corporal's cursing and swearing and rude orders, the mess-dish
and camp-bread, physical hardships all day and every other day, are for the former, but not
for the latter, novelties and, consequently, sufferings. From which it follows that, if literal
equality is applied, positive inequality is established, and that by virtue even of the new
creed, it is necessary, in the name of true equality as in the name of true liberty, to allow
the former, who would suffer most, to treat fairly and squarely with the latter, who will suffer
less. And all the more because, by this arrangement, the civil staff preserves for itself its
future recruits; it is from nineteen to twenty-six that the future chiefs and under-chiefs
of the great work of peaceful and fruitful labor, the savants, artists or scholars, the jurisconsults,
engineers or physicians, the enterprising men of commerce or of industry, receive and undertake
for themselves a special and superior education, discover or acquire their leading ideas, and
elaborate their originality or their competency. If talent is to be deprived of these productive
years their growth is arrested in full vegetation, and civil capacities, not less precious
for the State than military capacities, are rendered abortive.[3271]--Towards 1804,[3272] owing
to substitution, one conscript out of five in the rural districts, one conscript out of seven
in the towns, and, on the average, one conscript out of ten in France, escapes this forced
abortive condition; in 1806, the price of a substitute varies from eighteen hundred to four
thousand francs,[3273] and as capital is scarce, and ready money still more so, a sum like
this is sufficiently large. Accordingly, it is the rich or well-to-do class, in other words
the more or less cultivated class, which buys off its sons: reliance may be placed on their
giving them more or less complete culture. In this way, it prevents the State from mowing down
all its sprouting wheat and preserves a nursery of subjects among which society is to find
its future élite.--Thus attenuated, the military law is still rigid enough: nevertheless it
remains endurable. It is only towards 1807[3274] that it becomes monstrous and grows worse
and worse from year to year until it becomes the sepulcher of all French youth, even to taking
as canon fodder the adolescent under age and men already exempt or free by purchase. But, as
before these excesses, it may still be maintained with certain modifications; it suffices almost
to retouch it, to establish exemptions and the privilege of substitution as rights, which were
once simply favors,[3275] reduce the annual contingent, limit the term of service, guarantee
their lasting freedom to those liberated, and thus secure in 1818 a recruiting law satisfactory
and efficacious which, for more than half a century, will attain its ends without being too
detrimental or too odious, and which, among so many laws of the same sort, all mischievous,
is perhaps the least pernicious.
