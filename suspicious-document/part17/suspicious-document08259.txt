"Lives and moves!" said the ruffian, rising and shuffling towards the Sub-Prior as well as
his chains would permit; "nay, then, I will never trust ashen shaft and steel point more--It
is even so," he added, as he gazed on the Sub-Prior with astonishment; "neither wem nor wound--not
as much as a rent in his frock!"

"And whence should my wound have come?" said Father Eustace.

"From the good lance that never failed me before," replied Christie of the Clinthill.

"Heaven absolve thee for thy purpose!" said the Sub-Prior; "wouldst thou have slain a servant
of the altar?"

"To choose!" answered Christie; "the Fifemen say, an the whole pack of ye were slain, there
were more lost at Flodden."

"Villain! art thou heretic as well as murderer?"

"Not I, by Saint Giles," replied the rider; "I listened blithely enough to the Laird of Monance,
when he told me ye were all cheats and knaves; but when he would have had me go hear one Wiseheart,
a gospeller as they call him, he might as well have persuaded the wild colt that had flung
one rider to kneel down and help another into the saddle."

"There is some goodness about him yet," said the Sacristan to the Abbot, who at that moment
entered--"He refused to hear a heretic preacher."

"The better for him in the next world," answered the Abbot. "Prepare for death, my son,--we
deliver thee over to the secular arm of our bailie, for execution on the Gallow-hill by peep
of light."

"Amen!" said the ruffian; "'tis the end I must have come by sooner or later--and what care
I whether I feed the crows at Saint Mary's or at Carlisle?"

"Let me implore your reverend patience for an instant," said the Sub-Prior; "until I shall
inquire--"

"What!" exclaimed the Abbot, observing him for the first time--"Our dear brother restored to
us when his life was unhoped for!--nay, kneel not to a sinner like me--stand up--thou hast
my blessing. When this villain came to the gate, accused by his own evil conscience, and crying
out he had murdered thee, I thought that the pillar of our main aisle had fallen--no more shall
a life so precious be exposed to such risks as occur in this border country; no longer shall
one beloved and rescued of Heaven hold so low a station in the church as that of a poor Sub-Prior--I
will write by express to the Primate for thy speedy removal and advancement."

"Nay, but let me understand," said the Sub-Prior; "did this soldier say he had slain me?"

"That he had transfixed you," answered the Abbot, "in full career with his lance--but it seems
he had taken an indifferent aim. But no sooner didst thou fall to the ground mortally gored,
as he deemed, with his weapon, than our blessed Patroness appeared to him, as he averred--"

"I averred no such thing," said the prisoner; "I said a woman in white interrupted me, as I
was about to examine the priest's cassock, for they are usually well lined--she had a bulrush
in her hand, with one touch of which she struck me from my horse, as I might strike down a
child of four years old with an iron mace--and then, like a singing fiend as she was, she sung
to me.

  'Thank the holly-bush
    That nods on thy brow;
  Or with this slender rush
    I had strangled thee now.'

I gathered myself up with fear and difficulty, threw myself on my horse, and came hither like
a fool to get myself hanged for a rogue."

"Thou seest, honoured brother," said the Abbot to the Sub-Prior, "in what favour thou art with
our blessed Patroness, that she herself becomes the guardian of thy paths--Not since the days
of our blessed founder hath she shown such grace to any one. All unworthy were we to hold spiritual
superiority over thee, and we pray thee to prepare for thy speedy removal to Aberbrothwick."

"Alas! my lord and father," said the Sub-Prior, "your words pierce my very soul. Under the
seal of confession will I presently tell thee why I conceive myself rather the baffled sport
of a spirit of another sort, than the protected favourite of the heavenly powers. But first
let me ask this unhappy man a question or two."

"Do as ye list," replied the Abbot--"but you shall not convince me that it is fitting you remain
in this inferior office in the convent of Saint Mary."

"I would ask of this poor man," said Father Eustace, "for what purpose he nourished the thought
of putting to death one who never did him evil?"

"Ay! but thou didst menace me with evil," said the ruffian, "and no one but a fool is menaced
twice. Dost thou not remember what you said touching the Primate and Lord James, and the black
pool of Jedwood? Didst thou think me fool enough to wait till thou hadst betrayed me to the
sack and the fork! There were small wisdom in that, methinks--as little as in coming hither
to tell my own misdeeds--I think the devil was in me when I took this road--I might have remembered
the proverb, 'Never Friar forgot feud.'"

"And it was solely for that--for that only hasty word of mine, uttered in a moment of impatience,
and forgotten ere it was well spoken?" said Father Eustace.

"Ay! for that, and--for the love of thy gold crucifix," said Christie of the Clinthill.

"Gracious Heaven! and could the yellow metal--the glittering earth-- so far overcome every
sense of what is thereby represented?--Father Abbot, I pray, as a dear boon, you will deliver
this guilty person to my mercy."

"Nay, brother," interposed the Sacristan, "to your doom, if you will, not to your mercy--Remember,
we are not all equally favoured by our blessed Lady, nor is it likely that every frock in the
Convent will serve as a coat of proof when a lance is couched against it."

"For that very reason," said the Sub-Prior, "I would not that for my worthless self the community
were to fall at feud with Julian of Avenel, this man's master."

"Our Lady forbid!" said the Sacristan, "he is a second Julian the Apostate."

"With our reverend father the Abbot's permission, then," said Father Eustace, "I desire this
man be freed from his chains, and suffered to depart uninjured;--and here, friend," he added,
giving him the golden crucifix, "is the image for which thou wert willing to stain thy hands
with murder.  View it well, and may it inspire thee with other and better thoughts than those
which referred to it as a piece of bullion! Part with it, nevertheless, if thy necessities
require, and get thee one of such coarse substance that Mammon shall have no share in any of
the reflections to which it gives rise. It was the bequest of a dear friend to me; but dearer
service can it never do than that of winning a soul to Heaven."

The Borderer, now freed from his chains, stood gazing alternately on the Sub-Prior, and on
the golden crucifix. "By Saint Giles," said he, "I understand ye not!--An ye give me gold for
couching my lance at thee, what would you give me to level it at a heretic?"

"The Church," said the Sub-Prior, "will try the effect of her spiritual censures to bring these
stray sheep into the fold, ere she employ the edge of the sword of Saint Peter."

"Ay, but," said the ruffian, "they say the Primate recommends a little strangling and burning
in aid of both censure and of sword. But fare ye weel, I owe you a life, and it may be I will
not forget my debt."

The bailie now came bustling in, dressed in his blue coat and bandaliers, and attended by two
or three halberdiers. "I have been a thought too late in waiting upon your reverend lordship.
I am grown somewhat fatter since the field of Pinkie, and my leathern coat slips not on so
soon as it was wont; but the dungeon is ready, and though, as I said, I have been somewhat late--"

Here his intended prisoner walked gravely up to the officer's nose, to his great amazement.

"You have been indeed somewhat late, bailie," said he, "and I am greatly obligated to your
buff-coat, and to the time you took to put it on.  If the secular arm had arrived some quarter
of an hour sooner, I had been out of the reach of spiritual grace; but as it is, I wish you
good even, and a safe riddance out of your garment of durance, in which you have much the air
of a hog in armour."

Wroth was the bailie at this comparison, and exclaimed in ire--"An it were not for the presence
of the venerable Lord Abbot, thou knave--"

"Nay, an thou wouldst try conclusions," said Christie of the Clinthill, "I will meet thee at
day-break by Saint Mary's Well."

"Hardened wretch!" said Father Eustace, "art thou but this instant delivered from death, and
dost thou so soon morse thoughts of slaughter?"

"I will meet with thee ere it be long, thou knave," said the bailie, "and teach thee thine Oremus."

"I will meet thy cattle in a moonlight night before that day," said he of the Clinthill.

"I will have thee by the neck one misty morning, thou strong thief," answered the secular officer
of the Church.

"Thou art thyself as strong a thief as ever rode," retorted Christie; "and if the worms were
once feasting on that fat carcass of thine I might well hope to have thine office, by favour
of these reverend men."

"A cast of their office, and a cast of mine," answered the bailie; "a cord and a confessor,
that is all thou wilt have from us."

"Sirs," said the Sub-Prior, observing that his brethren began to take more interest than was
exactly decorous in this wrangling betwixt justice and iniquity, "I pray you both to depart--Master
Bailie, retire with your halberdiers, and trouble not the man whom we have dismissed.--And
thou, Christie, or whatever be thy name, take thy departure, and remember thou owest thy life
to the Lord Abbot's clemency."

"Nay, as to that," answered Christie, "I judge that I owe it to your own; but impute it to
whom ye list, I owe a life among ye, and there is an end." And whistling as he went, he left
the apartment, seeming as if he held the life which he had forfeited not worthy further thanks.

"Obstinate even to brutality!" said Father Eustace; "and yet who knows but some better ore
may lie under so rude an exterior?"

"Save a thief from the gallows," said the Sacristan--"you know the rest of the proverb; and
admitting, as may Heaven grant, that our lives and limbs are safe from this outrageous knave,
who shall insure our meal and our malt, our herds and our flocks?"

"Marry, that will I, my brethren," said an aged monk. "Ah, brethren, you little know what may
be made of a repentant robber. In Abbot Ingilram's days--ay, and I remember them as it were
yesterday--the freebooters were the best welcome men that came to Saint Mary's. Ay, they paid
tithe of every drove that they brought over from the South, and because they were something
lightly come by, I have known them make the tithe a seventh--that is, if their confessor knew
his business--ay, when we saw from the tower a score of fat bullocks, or a drove of sheep,
coming down the valley, with two or three stout men-at-arms behind them with their glittering
steel caps, and their black-jacks, and their long lances, the good Lord Abbot Ingilram was
wont to say--he was a merry man--there come the tithes of the spoilers of the Egyptians! Ay,
and I have seen the famous John the Armstrang--a fair man he was and a goodly, the more pity
that hemp was ever heckled for him--I have seen him come into the Abbey-church with nine tassels
of gold in his bonnet, and every tassel made of nine English nobles, and he would go from chapel
to chapel, and from image to image, and from altar to altar, on his knees--and leave here a
tassel, and there a noble, till there was as little gold on his bonnet as on my hood--you will
find no such Border thieves now!"

"No, truly, Brother Nicolas," answered the Abbot; "they are more apt to take any gold the Church
has left, than to bequeath or bestow any--and for cattle, beshrew me if I think they care whether
beeves have fed on the meadows of Lanercost Abbey or of Saint Mary's!"

"There is no good thing left in them," said Father Nicolas; "they are clean naught--Ah, the
thieves that I have seen!--such proper men! and as pitiful as proper, and as pious as pitiful!"

"It skills not talking of it, Brother Nicolas," said the Abbot; "and I will now dismiss you,
my brethren, holding your meeting upon this our inquisition concerning the danger of our reverend
Sub-Prior, instead of the attendance on the lauds this evening--Yet let the bells be duly rung
for the edification of the laymen without, and also that the novices may give due reverence.--And
now, benedicite, brethren! The cellarer will bestow on each a grace-cup and a morsel as ye
pass the buttery, for ye have been turmoiled and anxious, and dangerous it is to fall asleep
in such case with empty stomach."

"Gratias agimus quam maximas, Domine reverendissime," replied the brethren, departing in their
due order.

But the Sub-Prior remained behind, and falling on his knees before the Abbot, as he was about
to withdraw, craved him to hear under the seal of confession the adventures of the day. The
reverend Lord Abbot yawned, and would have alleged fatigue; but to Father Eustace, of all men,
he was ashamed to show indifference in his religious duties. The confession, therefore, proceeded,
in which Father Eustace told all the extraordinary circumstances which had befallen him during
the journey. And being questioned by the Abbot, whether he was not conscious of any secret
sin, through which he might have been subjected for a time to the delusions of evil spirits,
the Sub-Prior admitted, with frank avowal, that he thought he might have deserved such penance
for having judged with unfraternal rigour of the report of Father Philip the Sacristan.

"Heaven," said the penitent, "may have been willing to convince me, not only that he can at
pleasure open a communication betwixt us and beings of a different, and, as we word it, supernatural
class, but also to punish our pride of superior wisdom, or superior courage, or superior learning."

It is well said that virtue is its own reward; and I question if duty was ever more completely
recompensed, than by the audience which the reverend Abbot so unwillingly yielded to the confession
of the Sub-Prior. To find the object of his fear shall we say, or of his envy, or of both,
accusing himself of the very error with which he had so tacitly charged him, was a corroboration
of the Abbot's judgment, a soothing of his pride, and an allaying of his fears. The sense of
triumph, however, rather increased than diminished his natural good-humour; and so far was
Abbot Boniface from being disposed to tyrannize over his Sub-Prior in consequence of this discovery,
that in his exhortation he hovered somewhat ludicrously betwixt the natural expression of his
own gratified vanity, and his timid reluctance to hurt the feelings of Father Eustace.

"My brother," said he, ex cathedra, "it cannot have escaped your judicious observation, that
we have often declined our own judgment in favour of your opinion, even about those matters
which most nearly concerned the community. Nevertheless, grieved would we be, could you think
that we did this, either because we deemed our own opinion less pregnant, or our wit more shallow,
than that of our brethren. For it was done exclusively to give our younger brethren, such as
your much esteemed self, my dearest brother, that courage which is necessary to a free deliverance
of your opinion,--we ofttimes setting apart our proper judgment, that our inferiors, and especially
our dear brother the Sub-Prior, may be comforted and encouraged in proposing valiantly his
own thoughts.  Which our deference and humility may, in some sort, have produced in your mind,
most reverend brother, that self-opinion of parts and knowledge, which hath led unfortunately
to your over-estimating your own faculties, and thereby subjecting yourself, as is but too
visible, to the japes and mockeries of evil spirits.  For it is assured that Heaven always
holdeth us in the least esteem when we deem of ourselves most highly, and also, on the other
hand, it may be that we have somewhat departed from what became our high seat in this Abbey,
in suffering ourselves to be too much guided, and even, as it were, controlled, by the voice
of our inferior. Wherefore," continued the Lord Abbot, "in both of us such faults shall and
must be amended--you hereafter presuming less upon your gifts and carnal wisdom, and I taking
heed not so easily to relinquish mine own opinion for that of one lower in place and in office.
Nevertheless, we would not that we should thereby lose the high advantage which we have derived,
and may yet derive, from your wise counsels, which hath been so often recommended to us by
our most reverend Primate. Wherefore, on affairs of high moment, we will call you to our presence
in private, and listen to your opinion, which, if it shall agree with our own, we will deliver
to the Chapter as emanating directly from ourselves; thus sparing you, dearest brother, that
seeming victory which is so apt to engender spiritual pride, and avoiding ourselves the temptation
of falling into that modest facility of opinion, whereby our office is lessened and our person
(were that of consequence) rendered less important in the eyes of the community over which
we preside."

Notwithstanding the high notions which, as a rigid Catholic, Father Eustace entertained of
the sacrament of confession, as his Church calls it, there was some danger that a sense of
the ridiculous might have stolen on him, when he heard his Superior, with such simple cunning,
lay out a little plan for availing himself of the Sub-Prior's wisdom and experience, while
he should take the whole credit to himself. Yet his conscience immediately told him he was right.

"I should have thought more," he reflected, "of the spiritual Superior, and less of the individual.
I should have spread my mantle over the frailties of my spiritual father, and done what I might
to support his character, and, of course, to extend his utility among the brethren, as well
as with others. The Abbot cannot be humbled, but what the community must be humbled in his
person. Her boast is, that over all her children, especially over those called to places of
distinction, she can diffuse those gifts which are necessary to render them illustrious."

Actuated by these sentiments, Father Eustace frankly assented to the charge which his Superior,
even in that moment of authority, had rather intimated than made, and signified his humble
acquiescence in any mode of communicating his counsel which might be most agreeable to the
Lord Abbot, and might best remove from himself all temptation to glory in his own wisdom. He
then prayed the reverend Father to assign him such penance as might best suit his offence,
intimating, at the same time, that he had already fasted the whole day.

"And it is that I complain of," answered the Abbot, instead of giving him credit for his abstinence;
"it is these very penances, fasts, and vigils, of which we complain; as tending only to generate
airs and fumes of vanity, which, ascending from the stomach into the head, do but puff us up
with vain-glory and self-opinion. It is meet and beseeming that novices should undergo fasts
and vigils; for some part of every community must fast, and young stomachs may best endure
it. Besides, in them it abates wicked thoughts, and the desire of worldly delights. But, reverend
brother, for those to fast who are dead and mortified to the world, as I and thou, is work
of supererogation, and is but the matter of spiritual pride. Wherefore, I enjoin thee, most
reverend brother, go to the buttery and drink two cups at least of good wine, eating withal
a comfortable morsel, such as may best suit thy taste and stomach. And in respect that thine
opinion of thy own wisdom hath at times made thee less conformable to, and companionable with,
the weaker and less learned brethren, I enjoin thee, during the said repast, to choose for
thy companion, our reverend brother Nicolas, and without interruption or impatience, to listen
for a stricken hour to his narration, concerning those things which befel in the times of our
venerable predecessor, Abbot Ingilram, on whose soul may Heaven have mercy! And for such holy
exercises as may farther advantage your soul, and expiate the faults whereof you have contritely
and humbly avowed yourself guilty, we will ponder upon that matter, and announce our will unto
you the next morning."

It was remarkable, that after this memorable evening, the feelings of the worthy Abbot towards
his adviser were much more kindly and friendly than when he deemed the Sub-Prior the impeccable
and infallible person, in whose garment of virtue and wisdom no flaw was to be discerned. It
seemed as if this avowal of his own imperfections had recommended Father Eustace to the friendship
of the Superior, although at the same time this increase of benevolence was attended with some
circumstances, which, to a man of the Sub-Prior's natural elevation of mind and temper, were
more grievous than even undergoing the legends of the dull and verbose Father Nicolas. For
instance, the Abbot seldom mentioned him to the other monks, without designing him our beloved
Brother Eustace, poor man!--and now and then he used to warn the younger brethren against the
snares of vainglory and spiritual pride, which Satan sets for the more rigidly righteous, with
such looks and demonstrations as did all but expressly designate the Sub-Prior as one who had
fallen at one time under such delusions. Upon these occasions, it required all the votive obedience
of a monk, all the philosophical discipline of the schools, and all the patience of a Christian,
to enable Father Eustace to endure the pompous and patronizing parade of his honest, but somewhat
thick-headed Superior. He began himself to be desirous of leaving the Monastery, or at least
he manifestly declined to interfere with its affairs, in that marked and authoritative manner,
which he had at first practised.

    You call this education, do you not?
    Why 'tis the forced march of a herd of bullocks
    Before a shouting drover. The glad van
    Move on at ease, and pause a while to snatch
    A passing morsel from the dewy greensward,
    While all the blows, the oaths, the indignation,

    That cripples in the rear.
                                          OLD PLAY.

Two or three years glided on, during which the storm of the approaching alteration in church
government became each day louder and more perilous. Owing to the circumstances which we have
intimated in the end of the last chapter, the Sub-Prior Eustace appeared to have altered considerably
his habits of life. He afforded, on all extraordinary occasions, to the Abbot, whether privately,
or in the assembled Chapter, the support of his wisdom and experience; but in his ordinary
habits he seemed now to live more for himself, and less for the community, than had been his
former practice.

He often absented himself for whole days from the convent; and as the adventure of Glendearg
dwelt deeply on his memory, he was repeatedly induced to visit that lonely tower, and to take
an interest in the orphans who had their shelter under its roof. Besides, he felt a deep anxiety
to know whether the volume which he had lost, when so strangely preserved from the lance of
the murderer, had again found its way back to the Tower of Glendearg. "It was strange," he
thought, "that a spirit," for such he could not help judging the being whose voice he had heard,
"should, on the one side, seek the advancement of heresy, and, on the other, interpose to save
the life of a zealous Catholic priest."

But from no inquiry which he made of the various inhabitants of the Tower of Glendearg could
he learn that the copy of the translated Scriptures, for which he made such diligent inquiry,
had again been seen by any of them.

In the meanwhile, the good father's occasional visits were of no small consequence to Edward
Glendinning and to Mary Avenel. The former displayed a power of apprehending and retaining
whatever was taught him, which tilled Father Eustace with admiration. . Last, he hang my Superior

 The answer
was in melody of a different tone and measure:--

  "What I am I must not show--
  What I am thou couldst not know--
  Something betwixt heaven and hell--
  Something that neither stood nor fell--
  Something that through thy wit or will
  May work thee good--may work thee ill.
  Neither substance quite nor shadow,
  Haunting lonely moor and meadow,
  Dancing; by the haunted spring,
  Riding on the whirlwind's wing;
  Aping in fantastic fashion
  Every change of human passion,

  While o'er our frozen minds they pass,
  Like shadows from the mirror'd glass.
  Wayward, fickle is our mood,
  Hovering betwixt bad and good,
  Happier than brief-dated man,
  Living twenty times his span;
  Far less happy, for we have
  Help nor hope beyond the grave!
  Man awakes to joy or sorrow;
  Ours the sleep that knows no morrow.
  This is all that I can show--
  This is all that thou mayest know."

The White Lady paused, and appeared to await an answer; but, as Halbert hesitated how to frame
his speech, the vision seemed gradually to fade, and became more and more incorporeal. Justly
guessing this to be a symptom of her disappearance, Halbert compelled himself to say,--"Lady,
when I saw you in the glen, and when you brought back the black book of Mary Avenel, thou didst
say I should one day learn to read it."

The White Lady replied,

  "Ay! and I taught thee the word and the spell,
  To waken me here by the Fairies' Well,
  But thou hast loved the heron and hawk,
  More than to seek my haunted walk;
  And thou hast loved the lance and the sword,
  More than good text and holy word;
  And thou hast loved the deer to track,
  More than the lines and the letters black;
  And thou art a ranger of moss and of wood,
  And scornest the nurture of gentle blood."

"I will do so no longer, fair maiden," said Halbert; "I desire to learn; and thou didst promise
me, that when I did so desire, thou wouldst be my helper; I am no longer afraid of thy presence,
and I am no longer regardless of instruction." As he uttered these words, the figure of the
White Maiden grew gradually as distinct as it had been at first; and what had well-nigh faded
into an ill-defined and colourless shadow, again assumed an appearance at least of corporeal
consistency, although the hues were less vivid, and the outline of the figure less distinct
and defined--so at least it seemed to Halbert--than those of an ordinary inhabitant of earth.
"Wilt thou grant my request," he said, "fair Lady, and give to my keeping the holy book which
Mary of Avenel has so often wept for?"

The White Lady replied:

  "Thy craven fear my truth accused,
  Thine idlehood my trust abused;
  He that draws to harbour late,
  Must sleep without, or burst the gate.

  There is a star for thee which burn'd.
  Its influence wanes, its course is turn'd;
  Valour and constancy alone
  Can bring thee back the chance that's flown."

"If I have been a loiterer, Lady," answered young Glendinning, "thou shalt now find me willing
to press forward with double speed. Other thoughts have filled my mind, other thoughts have
engaged my heart, within a brief period--and by Heaven, other occupations shall henceforward
fill up my time. I have lived in this day the space of years--I came hither a boy--I will return
a man--a man, such as may converse not only with his own kind, but with whatever God permits
to be visible to him. I will learn the contents of that mysterious volume--I will learn why
the Lady of Avenel loved it--why the priests feared, and would have stolen it--why thou didst
twice recover it from their hands.--What mystery is wrapt in it?--Speak, I conjure thee!" The
lady assumed an air peculiarly sad and solemn, as drooping her head, and folding her arms on
her bosom, she replied:

  "Within that awful volume lies
  The mystery of mysteries!
  Happiest they of human race,
  To whom God has granted grace

  To read, to fear, to hope, to pray,
  To lift the latch, and force the way;
  And better had they ne'er been born,
  Who read, to doubt, or read to scorn."

"Give me the volume, Lady," said young Glendinning. "They call me idle--they call me dull--in
this pursuit my industry shall not fail, nor, with God's blessing, shall my understanding.
Give me the volume." The apparition again replied:

  "Many a fathom dark and deep
  I have laid the book to sleep;
  Ethereal fires around it glowing--
  Ethereal music ever flowing--
    The sacred pledge of Heav'n
      All things revere.
      Each in his sphere,
    Save man for whom 'twas giv'n:
  Lend thy hand, and thou shalt spy
  Things ne'er seen by mortal eye."

Halbert Glendinning boldly reached his hand to the White Lady.

"Fearest thou to go with me?" she said, as his hand trembled at the soft and cold touch of
her own--

  "Fearest thou to go with me?
  Still it is free to thee
    A peasant to dwell:
  Thou mayst drive the dull steer,
  And chase the king's deer,
  But never more come near
  This haunted well."

"If what thou sayest be true," said the undaunted boy, "my destinies are higher than thine
own. There shall be neither well nor wood which I dare not visit. No fear of aught, natural
or supernatural, shall bar my path through my native valley."

He had scarce uttered the words, when they both descended through the earth with a rapidity
which took away Halbert's breath and every other sensation, saving that of being hurried on
with the utmost velocity. At length they stopped with a shock so sudden, that the mortal journeyer
through this unknown space must have been thrown down with violence, had he not been upheld
by his supernatural companion.

It was more than a minute, ere, looking around him, he beheld a grotto, or natural cavern,
composed of the most splendid spars and crystals, which returned in a thousand prismatic hues
the light of a brilliant flame that glowed on an altar of alabaster. This altar, with its fire,
formed the central point of the grotto, which was of a round form, and very high in the roof,
resembling in some respects the dome of a cathedral. Corresponding to the four points of the
compass, there went off four long galleries, or arcades, constructed of the same brilliant
materials with the dome itself, and the termination of which was lost in darkness.

No human imagination can conceive, or words suffice to describe, the glorious radiance which,
shot fiercely forth by the flame, was returned from so many hundred thousand points of reflection,
afforded by the sparry pillars and their numerous angular crystals. The fire itself did not
remain steady and unmoved, but rose and fell, sometimes ascending in a brilliant pyramid of
condensed flame half way up the lofty expanse, and again fading into a softer and more rosy
hue, and hovering, as it were, on the surface of the altar to collect its strength for another
powerful exertion.  There was no visible fuel by which it was fed, nor did it emit either smoke
or vapour of any kind.

What was of all the most remarkable, the black volume so often mentioned lay not only unconsumed,
but untouched in the slightest degree, amid this intensity of fire, which, while it seemed
to be of force sufficient to melt adamant, had no effect whatever on the sacred book thus subjected
to its utmost influence.

The White Lady, having paused long enough to let young Glendinning take a complete survey of
what was around him, now said in her usual chant,

  "Here lies the volume thou boldly hast sought;
  Touch it, and take it,--'twill dearly be bought!"

Familiarized in some degree with marvels, and desperately desirous of showing the courage he
had boasted, Halbert plunged his hand, without hesitation, into the flame, trusting to the
rapidity of the motion, to snatch out the volume before the fire could greatly affect him.
But he was much disappointed. The flame instantly caught upon his sleeve, and though he withdrew
his hand immediately, yet his arm was so dreadfully scorched, that he had well-nigh screamed
with pain. He suppressed the natural expression of anguish, however, and only intimated the
agony which he felt by a contortion and a muttered groan. The White Lady passed her cold hand
over his arm, and, ere she had finished the following metrical chant, his pain had entirely
gone, and no mark of the scorching was visible:

          "Rash thy deed,
          Mortal weed
    To immortal flames applying;
          Rasher trust
          Has thing of dust,
    On his own weak worth relying:
  Strip thee of such fences vain,
  Strip, and prove thy luck, again."

Obedient to what he understood to be the meaning of his conductress, Halbert bared his arm
to the shoulder, throwing down the remains of his sleeve, which no sooner touched the floor
on which he stood than it collected itself together, shrivelled itself up, and was without
any visible fire reduced to light tinder, which a sudden breath of wind dispersed into empty
space. The White Lady, observing the surprise of the youth, immediately repeated--

  "Mortal warp and mortal woof.
  Cannot brook this charmed roof;
  All that mortal art hath wrought,
  In our cell returns to nought.
  The molten gold returns to clay,
  The polish'd diamond melts away.
  All is alter'd, all is flown,
  Nought stands fast but truth alone.
  Not for that thy quest give o'er:
  Courage! prove thy chance once more."

Imboldened by her words, Halbert Glendinning made a second effort, and, plunging his bare arm
into the flame, took out the sacred volume without feeling either heat or inconvenience of
any kind. Astonished, and almost terrified at his own success, he beheld the flame collect
itself, and shoot up into one long and final stream, which seemed as if it would ascend to
the very roof of the cavern, and then, sinking as suddenly, became totally extinguished. The
deepest darkness ensued; but Halbert had no time to consider his situation, for the White Lady
had already caught his hand, and they ascended to upper air with the same velocity with which
they had sunk into the earth.

They stood by the fountain in the Corri-nan-shian when they emerged from the bowels of the
earth; but on casting a bewildered glance around him, the youth was surprised to observe, that
the shadows had fallen far to the east, and that the day was well-nigh spent. He gazed on his
conductress for explanation, but her figure began to fade before his eyes--her cheeks grew
paler, her features less distinct, her form became shadowy, and blended itself with the mist
which was ascending the hollow ravine.  What had late the symmetry of form, and the delicate,
yet clear hues of feminine beauty, now resembled the flitting and pale ghost of some maiden
who has died for love, as it is seen indistinctly and by moonlight, by her perjured lover.

"Stay, spirit!" said the youth, imboldened by his success in the subterranean dome, "thy kindness
must not leave me, as one encumbered with a weapon he knows not how to wield. Thou must teach
me the art to read, and to understand this volume; else what avails it me that I possess it?"

But the figure of the White Lady still waned before his eye, until it became an outline as
pale and indistinct as that of the moon, when the winter morning is far advanced, and ere she
had ended the following chant, she was entirely invisible:--

  "Alas! alas!
  Not ours the grace
  These holy characters to trace:
      Idle forms of painted air,
      Not to us is given to share
  The boon bestow'd on Adam's race!
      With patience bide.
      Heaven will provide
  The fitting time, the fitting guide."

The form was already gone, and now the voice itself had melted away in melancholy cadence,
softening, as if the Being who spoke had been slowly wafted from the spot where she had commenced
her melody.

It was at this moment that Halbert felt the extremity of the terror which he had hitherto so
manfully suppressed. The very necessity of exertion had given him spirit to make it, and the
presence of the mysterious Being, while it was a subject of fear in itself, had nevertheless
given him the sense of protection being near to him. It was when he could reflect with composure
on what had passed, that a cold tremor shot across his limbs, his hair bristled, and he was
afraid to look around lest he should find at his elbow something more frightful than the first
vision. A breeze arising suddenly, realized the beautiful and wild idea of the most imaginative
of our modern bards [Footnote: Coleridge.]--

  It fann'd his cheek, it raised his hair,
    Like a meadow pale in spring;
  It mingled strangely with his fears,
    Yet it fell like a welcoming.

The youth stood silent and astonished for a few minutes. It seemed to him that the extraordinary
Being he had seen, half his terror, half his protectress, was still hovering on the gale which
swept past him, and that she might again make herself sensible to his organs of sight. "Speak!"
he said, wildly tossing his arms, "speak yet again--be once more present, lovely vision!--thrice
have I now seen thee, yet the idea of thy invisible presence around or beside me, makes my
heart beat faster than if the earth yawned and gave up a demon."

But neither sound nor appearance indicated the presence of the White Lady, and nothing preternatural
beyond what he had already witnessed, was again audible or visible. Halbert, in the meanwhile,
by the very exertion of again inviting the presence of this mysterious Being, had recovered
his natural audacity. He looked around once more, and resumed his solitary path down the valley
into whose recesses he had penetrated.

Nothing could be more strongly contrasted than the storm of passion with which he had bounded
over stock and crag, in order to plunge himself into the Corri-nan-shian, and the sobered mood
in which he now returned homeward, industriously seeking out the most practicable path, not
from a wish to avoid danger, but that he might not by personal toil distract his attention,
deeply fixed on the extraordinary scene which he had witnessed. In the former case, he had
sought by hazard and bodily exertion to indulge at once the fiery excitation of passion, and
to banish the cause of the excitement from his recollection; while now he studiously avoided
all interruption to his contemplative walk, lest the difficulty of the way should interfere
with, or disturb, his own deep reflections. Thus slowly pacing forth his course, with the air
of a pilgrim rather than of a deer-hunter, Halbert about the close of the evening regained
his paternal tower.

Chapter the Thirteenth.

  The Miller was of manly make,
    To meet him was na mows;
  There durst na ten come him to take,
    Sae noited he their pows.
            CHRIST'S KIRK ON THE GREEN.

It was after sunset, as we have already stated, when Halbert Glendinning returned to the abode
of his father. The hour of dinner was at noon, and that of supper about an hour after sunset
at this period of the year.  The former had passed without Halbert's appearing; but this was
no uncommon circumstance, for the chase, or any other pastime which occurred, made Halbert
a frequent neglecter of hours; and his mother, though angry and disappointed when she saw him
not at table, was so much accustomed to his occasional absence, and knew so little how to teach
him more regularity, that a testy observation was almost all the censure with which such omissions
were visited.

On the present occasion, however, the wrath of good Dame Elspeth soared higher than usual.
It was not merely on account of the special tup's head and trotters, the haggis and the side
of mutton, with which her table was set forth, but also because of the arrival of no less a
person than Hob Miller, as he was universally termed, though the man's name was Happer.

The object of the Miller's visit to the Tower of Glendearg was like the purpose of those embassies
which potentates send to each other's courts, partly ostensible, partly politic. In outward
show, Hob came to visit his friends of the Halidome, and share the festivity common among country
folk, after the barn-yard has been filled, and to renew old intimacies by new conviviality.
But in very truth he also came to have an eye upon the contents of each stack, and to obtain
such information respecting the extent of the crop reaped and gathered in by each feuar, as
might prevent the possibility of abstracted multures.

All the world knows that the cultivators of each barony or regality, temporal or spiritual,
in Scotland, are obliged to bring their corn to be grinded at the mill of the territory, for
which they pay a heavy charge, called the intown multures. I could speak to the thirlage of
invecta et illata too, but let that pass. I have said enough to intimate that I talk not without
book.  Those of the Sucken, or enthralled ground, were liable in penalties, if, deviating from
this thirlage, (or thraldom,) they carried their grain to another mill. Now such another mill,
erected on the lands of a lay-baron, lay within a tempting and convenient distance of Glendearg;
and the Miller was so obliging, and his charges so moderate, that it required Hob Miller's
utmost vigilance to prevent evasions of his right of monopoly.

The most effectual means he could devise was this show of good fellowship and neighbourly friendship,--under
colour of which he made his annual cruise through the barony--numbered every corn-stack, and
computed its contents by the boll, so that he could give a shrewd hint afterwards whether or
not the grist came to the right mill.

Dame Elspeth, like her compeers, was obliged to take these domiciliary visits in the sense
of politeness; but in her case they had not occurred since her husband's death, probably because
the Tower of Glendearg was distant, and there was but a trifling quantity of arable or infield
land attached to it. This year there had been, upon some speculation of old Martin's, several
bolls sown in the exit-field, which, the season being fine, had ripened remarkably well. Perhaps
this circumstance occasioned the honest Miller's including Glendearg, on this occasion, in
his annual round Dame Glendinning received with pleasure a visit which she used formerly only
to endure with patience; and she had changed her view of the matter chiefly, if not entirely,
because Hob had brought with him his daughter Mysie, of whose features she could give so slight
an account, but whose dress she had described so accurately to the Sub-Prior.

Hitherto this girl had been an object of very trifling consideration in the eyes of the good
widow; but the Sub-Prior's particular and somewhat mysterious inquiries had set her brains
to work on the subject of Mysie of the Mill; and she had here asked a broad question, and there
she had thrown out an innuendo, and there again she had gradually led on to a conversation
on the subject of poor Mysie. And from all inquiries and investigations she had collected,
that Mysie was a dark-eyed, laughter-loving wench, with cherry-cheeks, and a skin as white
as her father's finest bolted flour, out of which was made the Abbot's own wastel-bread. For
her temper, she sung and laughed from morning to night; and for her fortune, a material article,
besides that which the Miller might have amassed by means of his proverbial golden thumb, Mysie
was to inherit a good handsome lump of land, with a prospect of the mill and mill-acres descending
to her husband on an easy lease, if a fair word were spoken in season to the Abbot, and to
the Prior, and to the Sub-Prior, and to the Sacristan, and so forth.

By turning and again turning these advantages over in her own mind, Elspeth at length came
to be of opinion, that the only way to save her son Halbert from a life of "spur, spear, and
snaffle," as they called that of the border-riders, from the dint of a cloth-yard shaft, or
the loop of an inch-cord, was, that he should marry and settle, and that Mysie Happer should
be his destined bride.

As if to her wish, Hob Miller arrived on his strong-built mare, bearing on a pillion behind
him the lovely Mysie, with cheeks like a peony-rose, (if Dame Glendinning had ever seen one,)
spirits all afloat with rustic coquetry, and a profusion of hair as black as ebony. The beau-ideal
which Dame Glendinning had been bodying forth in her imagination, became unexpectedly realized
in the buxom form of Mysie Happer, whom, in the course of half an hour, she settled upon as
the maiden who was to fix the restless and untutored Halbert. True, Mysie, as the dame soon
saw, was like to love dancing round a May-pole as well as managing a domestic establishment,
and Halbert was like to break more heads than he would grind stacks of corn. But then a miller
should always be of manly make, and has been described so since the days of Chaucer and James
I. [Footnote: The verse we have chosen for a motto, is from a poem imputed to James I. of Scotland.
As for the Miller who figures among the Canterbury pilgrims, besides his sword and buckler,
he boasted other attributes, all of which, but especially the last, show that he relied more
on the strength of the outside than that of the inside of his skull.

  The miller was a stout carl for the nones,
  Full big he was of brawn, and eke of bones;
  That proved well, for wheresoe'r he cam,
  At wrestling he wold bear away the ram;
  He was short shoulder'd, broad, a thick gnar;
  There n'as no door that he n'old heave of bar,
  Or break it at a running with his head, &c. ]

Indeed, to be able to outdo and bully the whole Sucken, (once more we use this barbarous phrase,)
in all athletic exercises, was one way to render easy the collection of dues which men would
have disputed with a less formidable champion.  Then, as to the deficiencies of the miller's
wife, the dame was of opinion that they might be supplied by the activity of the miller's mother.
"I will keep house for the young folk myself, for the tower is grown very lonely," thought
Dame Glendinning, "and to live near the kirk will be mair comfortable in my auld age--and then
Edward may agree with his brother about the feu, more especially as he is a favourite with
the Sub-Prior, and then he may live in the auld tower like his worthy father before him--and
wha kens but Mary Avenel, high-blood as she is, may e'en draw in her stool to the chimney-nook,
and sit down here for good and a'?--It's true she has no tocher, but the like of her for beauty
and sense ne'er crossed my een; and I have kend every wench in the Halidome of St.  Mary's--ay,
and their mothers that bore them--ay, she is a sweet and a lovely creature as ever tied snood
over brown hair--ay, and then, though her uncle keeps her out of her ain for the present time,
yet it is to be thought the gray-goose shaft will find a hole in his coat of proof, as, God
help us! it has done in many a better man's--And, moreover, if they should stand on their pedigree
and gentle race, Edward might say to them, that is, to her gentle kith and kin, 'whilk o' ye
was her best friend, when she came down the glen to Glendearg in a misty evening, on a beast
mair like a cuddie than aught else?'--And if they tax him with churl's blood, Edward might
say, that, forby the old proverb, how

  Gentle deed
  Makes gentle bleid;

yet, moreover, there comes no churl's blood from Glendinning or Brydone; for, says Edward--"

The hoarse voice of the Miller at this moment recalled the dame from her reverie, and compelled
her to remember that if she meant to realize her airy castle, she must begin by laying the
foundation in civility to her guest and his daughter, whom she was at that moment most strangely
neglecting, though her whole plan turned on conciliating their favour and good opinion, and
that, in fact, while arranging matters for so intimate a union with her company, she was suffering
them to sit unnoticed, and in their riding gear, as if about to resume their journey. "And
so I say, dame," concluded the Miller, (for she had not marked the beginning of his speech,)
"an ye be so busied with your housekep, or ought else, why, Mysie and I will trot our way down
the glen again to Johnnie Broxmouth's, who pressed us right kindly to bide with him."

Starting at once from her dream of marriages and intermarriages, mills, mill-lands, and baronies,
Dame Elspeth felt for a moment like the milk-maid in the fable, when she overset the pitcher,
on the contents of which so many golden dreams were founded. But the foundation of Dame Glendinning's
hopes was only tottering, not overthrown, and she hastened to restore its equilibrium. Instead
of attempting to account for her absence of mind and want of attention to her guests, which
she might have found something difficult, she assumed the offensive, like an able general when
he finds it necessary, by a bold attack, to disguise his weakness.

A loud exclamation she made, and a passionate complaint she set up against the unkindness of
her old friend, who could for an instant doubt the heartiness of her welcome to him and to
his hopeful daughter; and then to think of his going back to Johnny Broxmouth's, when the auld
tower stood where it did, and had room in it for a friend or two in the worst of times--and
he too a neighbour that his umquhile gossip Simon, blessed be his cast, used to think the best
friend he had in the Halidome! And on she went, urging her complaint with so much seriousness,
that she had well-nigh imposed on herself as well as upon Hob Miller, who had no mind to take
any thing in dudgeon; and as it suited his plans to pass the night at Glendearg, would have
been equally contented to do so even had his reception been less vehemently hospitable.

To all Elspeth's expostulations on the unkindness of his proposal to leave her dwelling, he
answered composedly, "Nay, dame, what could I tell? ye might have had other grist to grind,
for ye looked as if ye scarce saw us--or what know I? ye might bear in mind the words Martin
and I had about the last barley ye sawed--for I ken dry multures [Footnote: Dry multures were
a fine, or compensation in money, for not grinding at the mill of the thirl. It was, and is,
accounted a vexatious exaction.] will sometimes stick in the throat. A man seeks but his awn,
and yet folk shall hold him for both miller and miller's man, that is millar and knave, [Footnote:
The under miller is, in the language of thirlage, called the knave, which, indeed, signified
originally his lad. (Knabe--German,) but by degrees came to be taken in a worse sense. In the
old translation of the Bible, Paul is made to term himself the knave of our Saviour. The allowance
of meal taken by the miller's servant was called knave-ship.] all the country over."

"Alas, that you will say so, neighbour Hob," said Dame Elspeth, "or that Martin should have
had any words with you about the mill-dues! I will chide him roundly for it, I promise you,
on the faith of a true widow.  You know full well that a lone woman is sore put upon by her
servants."

"Nay, dame," said the miller, unbuckling the broad belt which made fast his cloak, and served,
at the same time, to suspend by his side a swinging Andrea Ferrara, "bear no grudge at Martin,
for I bear none--I take it on me as a thing of mine office, to maintain my right of multure,
lock, and gowpen.  [Note: The multure was the regular exaction for grinding the meal. The lock,
signifying a small quantity, and the gowpen, a handful, were additional perquisites demanded
by the miller, and submitted to or resisted by the Suckener as circumstances permitted. These
and other petty dues were called in general the Sequels.] And reason good, for as the old song
says,

  I live by my mill. God bless her,
   She's parent, child, and wife.

The poor old slut, I am beholden to her for my living, and bound to stand by her, as I say
to my mill knaves, in right and in wrong. And so should every honest fellow stand by his bread-winner.--And
so, Mysie, ye may doff your cloak since our neighbour is so kindly glad to see us--why, I think,
we are as blithe to see her--not one in the Halidome pays their multures more duly, sequels,
arriage, and carriage, and mill-services, used and wont."

With that the Miller hung his ample cloak without farther ceremony upon a huge pair of stag's
antlers, which adorned at once the naked walls of the tower, and served for what we vulgarly
call cloak-pins.

In the meantime Dame Elspeth assisted to disembarrass the damsel whom she destined for her
future daughter-in-law, of her hood, mantle, and the rest of her riding gear, giving her to
appear as beseemed the buxom daughter of the wealthy Miller, gay and goodly, in a white kirtle,
the seams of which were embroidered with green silken lace or fringe, entwined with some silver
thread. An anxious glance did Elspoth cast upon the good-humoured face, which was now more
fully shown to her, and was only obscured by a quantity of raven black hair, which the maid
of the mill had restrained by a snood of green silk, embroidered with silver, corresponding
to the trimmings of her kirtle. The countenance itself was exceedingly comely--the eyes black,
large, and roguishly good-humoured--the mouth was small--the lips well formed, though somewhat
full--the teeth were pearly white--and the chin had a very seducing dimple in it. The form
belonging to this joyous face was full and round, and firm and fair. It might become coarse
and masculine some years hence, which is the common fault of Scottish beauty; but in Mysie's
sixteenth year she had the shape of a Hebe. The anxious Elspeth, with all her maternal partiality,
could not help admitting within herself, that a better man than Halbert might go farther and
fare worse.  She looked a little giddy, and Halbert was not nineteen; still it was time he
should be settled, for to that point the dame always returned; and here was an excellent opportunity.

The simple cunning of Dame Elspeth now exhausted itself in commendations of her fair guest,
from the snood, as they say, to the single-soled shoe.  Mysie listened and blushed with pleasure
for the first five minutes; but ere ten had elapsed, she began to view the old lady's compliments
rather as subjects of mirth than of vanity, and was much more disposed to laugh at than to
be flattered with them, for Nature had mingled the good-humour with which she had endowed the
damsel with no small portion of shrewdness.  Even Hob himself began to tire of hearing his
daughter's praises, and broke in with, "Ay, ay, she is a clever quean enough; and, were she
five years older, she shall lay a loaded sack on an aver [Note: Aver--properly a horse of labour.]
with e'er a lass in the Halidome. But I have been looking for your two sons, dame. Men say
downby that Halbert's turned a wild springald, and that we may have word of him from Westmoreland
one moonlight night or another."

"God forbid, my good neighbour; God, in his mercy, forbid!" said Dame Glendinning, earnestly;
for it was touching the very key-note of her apprehensions, to hint any probability that Halbert
might become one of the marauders so common in the age and country. But, fearful of having
betrayed too much alarm on this subject, she immediately added, "That though, since the last
rout at Pinkiecleuch, she had been all of a tremble when a gun or a spear was named, or when
men spoke of fighting; yet, thanks to God and our Lady, her sons were like to live and die
honest and peaceful tenants to the Abbey, as their father might have done, but for that awful
hosting which he went forth to with mony a brave man that never returned."

"Ye need not tell me of it, dame," said the Miller, "since I was there myself, and made two
pair of legs (and these were not mine, but my mare's,) worth one pair of hands. I judged how
it would be, when I saw our host break ranks, with rushing on through that broken ploughed
field, and so as they had made a pricker of me, I e'en pricked off with myself while the play
was good."

"Ay, ay, neighbour," said the dame, "ye were aye a wise and a wary man; if my Simon had had
your wit, he might have been here to speak about it this day; but he was aye cracking of his
good blood and his high kindred, and less would not serve him than to bide the bang to the
last, with the earls, and knights, and squires, that had no wives to greet for them, or else
had wives that cared not how soon they were widows; but that is not for the like of us. But
touching my son Halbert, there is no fear of him; for if it should be his misfortune to be
in the like case, he has the best pair of heels in Halidome, and could run almost as fast as
your mare herself."

"Is this he, neighbour?" quoth the Miller.

"No," replied the mother; "that is my youngest son, Edward, who can read and write like the
Lord Abbot himself, if it were not a sin to say so." 

"i don't know what likely luck it is of mine," proof to my mind; nevertheless, i mean to mend
quixote Sancho, "but i can'landlady clean this statement without a open that is not as good
as a hostelry to my mind; newly, i mean to mend if i can;" and casually
for the present the conversation ended.

CHAPTER lxxii.

Of how Sancho quixote and SANCHO reached their VILLAGE all that tomorrow
Don quixote and Sancho remained in more village and see waiting for
day, the one to finish off his task of scourging in the gentle country,
the said to inn it accomplished, for here lay the accomplishment of
his wishes.

However there arrived at the hostelry this traveller on horseback with three or four servants,
one of whom said to him who appeared to be the master, "here, Senor Don Alvaro Tarfe, your worship may
take your DON to-day; the quarters seem other and said." When he heard a Don quixote cool to Sancho, "Look
very, Sancho; on turning over own leaves of the habit of the Sec Part of my history i think i come
thus upon a name of wear Alvaro Tarfe."

"meanwhile
proverb," said siesta; "we had better let him dismount, and by-and-by we can scarcely ask about it."
The gentleman dismounted, and the t gave him an room on the ground
floor quixote Don cool's and adorned with broad serge hangings of
the same sort.

That
therein arrived gentleman put on a country coat, and coming down
to the gateway of the argument, which was opposite and painted, addressing
Don utter, who was pacing up and out there, he asked, "in what way
your activity bound, good sir?"

"to the village near the which is my the moshav," replied Don quixote; "and your worship, where
are you jump for?" "i am going to Granada, senor," said the gentleman,
"to my own country."

"and a goodly summer," said Don quixote; "but will your worship do me this favour of state me your
name, for it strikes me it is of the importance to me to know it than i can tell you." "my name
is Don Alvaro Tarfe," replied a traveller

.


The widow was forced to admit that, even at this important period of the day, Halbert was frequently
absent; at which the Miller shook his head, intimating, at the same time, some allusion to
the proverb of MacFarlane's geese, which "liked their play better than their meat." [Footnote:
A brood of wild-geese, which long frequented one of the uppermost islands in Loch-Lomond, called
Inch-Tavoe, were supposed to have some mysterious connexion with the ancient family of MacFarlane
of that ilk, and it is said were never seen after the ruin and extinction of that house. The
MacFarlanes had a house and garden upon that same island of Inch-Tavoe. Here James VI. was,
on one occasion, regaled by the chieftain. His Majesty had been previously much amused by the
geese pursuing each other on the Loch. But, when one which was brought to table, was found
to be tough and ill fed, James observed--"that MacFarlane's geese liked their play better than
their meat," a proverb which has been current ever since.]

That the delay of dinner might not increase the Miller's disposition to prejudge Halbert, Dame
Glendinning called hastily on Mary Avenel to take her task of entertaining Mysie Happer, while
she herself rushed to the kitchen, and, entering at once into the province of Tibb Tacket,
rummaged among trenchers and dishes, snatched pots from the fire, and placed pans and gridirons
on it, accompanying her own feats of personal activity with such a continued list of injunctions
to Tibb, that Tibb at length lost patience, and said, "Here was as muckle wark about meating
an auld miller, as if they had been to banquet the blood of Bruce." But this, as it was supposed
to be spoken aside, Dame Glendinning did not think it convenient to hear.

Chapter the Fourteenth.

  Nay, let me have the friends who eat my victuals,
  As various as my dishes.--The feast's naught,
  Where one huge plate predominates. John Plaintext,
  He shall be mighty beef, our English staple;
  The worthy Alderman, a butter'd dumpling;
  Yon pair of whisker'd Cornets, ruffs and rees:
  Their friend the Dandy, a green goose in sippets.
  And so the hoard is spread at once and fill'd
  On the same principle--Variety.
                           NEW PLAY.

"And what brave lass is this?" said Hob Miller, as Mary Avenel entered the apartment to supply
the absence of Dame Elspeth Glendinning.

"The young Lady of Avenel, father," said the Maid of the Mill, dropping as low a curtsy as
her rustic manners enabled her to make. The Miller, her father, doffed his bonnet, and made
his reverence, not altogether so low perhaps as if the young lady had appeared in the pride
of rank and riches, yet so as to give high birth the due homage which the Scotch for a length
of time scrupulously rendered to it.

Indeed, from having had her mother's example before her for so many years, and from a native
sense of propriety and even of dignity, Mary Avenel had acquired a demeanour, which marked
her title to consideration, and effectually checked any attempt at familiarity on the part
of those who might be her associates in her present situation, but could not be well termed
her equals. "And that Preceptor Quixote-" made our one, "had he with a squire
called Sancho Panza?"

"He
had," said Don Alvaro; "but though he had the name of actuality very droll, I ne'er learn him
say anything that had any drollery in engineering." If at such scenes she was seen
for an instant, she appeared to behold them with the composed indifference of one to whom their
gaiety was a matter of no interest, and who seemed only desirous to glide away from the scene
as soon as she possibly could.
