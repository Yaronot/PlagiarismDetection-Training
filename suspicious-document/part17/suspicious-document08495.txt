Desmond coolly ordered his men to proceed with the work. A minute later there was a sharp discharge
of musketry, followed by cries, shouts, and the sound of galloping horses. The villagers scuttled
away shrieking. Immediately afterward Bulger and Toley with their eight men sprang from cover
and made a dash for the wall.

"Muskets first!" shouted Desmond.

The muskets were pitched over: then the men scrambled up, Desmond and his Sepoys assisting
them to get across. Almost the first to drop down into the compound was Bulger, whose hook
had proved, not for the first time, of more service than a sound left arm. Once over himself,
he used his hook to haul the Sepoys after him, with many a vigorous "Yo, heave ho!"

"All aboard, sir," he cried, when the last of the men was within the wall. "I may be wrong,
but I lay my button hook 'tis now all hands to repel boarders; and only two cutlasses among
us--mine and Mr. Toley's. What ho, mateys! who cares--"

Desmond ordered four of his men to post themselves at the barricaded gateway: the rest he divided
into two parties, and stationed behind the wall at each side. The wall was six feet high--too
high to fire over; but as it was in a somewhat dilapidated condition there was no difficulty
in knocking away several loose bricks at intervals, so as to make a rough and ready battlement.
Desmond instructed the men to fire alternately through the embrasures thus made. As soon as
one had fired he was to fall back and reload as fast as possible while another man took his
place. By this device, Desmond hoped to deceive the enemy for a time as to the number of the
defenders in the compound.

But it was not to be expected that the enemy could long be kept out, and in the last resort
it would be necessary to retreat to the house. In view of the presence of the ladies this was
a step to be avoided if possible. It might indeed be the wiser course to surrender, for their
sakes. As the thought struck Desmond he called to the Babu, who was keeping watch on the roof.

"Babu," he said, "ask the ladies to occupy the least exposed room. Tell them  that  if  the
enemy  get over the wall I will try to make an arrangement with them, rather than provoke an
attack on the house."

The Babu disappeared. But a few moments later Phyllis Merriman, wearing the costume of a native
lady, came running out.

At the time Desmond knew nothing of the deceit that had been practised on him; but in the light
of his after knowledge he understood the strange expression that clouded Clive's face as the
old man was carried away: a look of pity mingled with contempt. Catching sight of Desmond,
the great soldier flashed out:

"What do you mean, sir, by absenting yourself so long? I sent you in advance because I thought
you would be speedy. A snail would have gone more quickly."

"I am sorry, sir," said Desmond; "I was unexpectedly delayed. I had got nearly  as  far  as
Rajmahal when I learned the whereabouts of Mrs. Merriman. She was in hiding with Surendra Nath,
one of Mr. Merriman's men.  I  heard  that  Diggle--Peloti, sir--was about to attempt her recapture,
and I felt that you yourself, had you been in my place, would have tried to save the ladies."

Clive grunted.

"Go on, sir," he said.

"We found the place just in time, sir. Diggle came up with a couple of Frenchmen and a troop
of native horse. We beat them off, and I have brought the ladies here."

"And forgotten your instructions?"

"No, sir. Monsieur Law was advancing from Patna: Diggle was coming ahead to inform the Nawab
of his approach. But the whole country knows of your victory, and I fancy Monsieur Law will
come no further."

"And Diggle?"

"He was killed in the fight, sir."

"Indeed! And how many did his men muster?"

"Nearly sixty, sir."

"And yours?"

"A score of Sepoys, sir; but I had two seamen with me: Bulger, whom you know; and Mr. Toley,
an American, mate of one of Mr. Merriman's ships. They were worth a dozen others."

Clive grunted again.

"Well, go and tell Mrs. Merriman I shall be glad to wait on her. And look here, Burke: you
may consider yourself a captain in the Company's service from this day. Come now, I'm very
busy: go and give Mrs. Merriman my message, and take care that next time you are sent on special
service you are not drawn off on any such mad expedition. Come to me tomorrow."

Desmond trod on air as he left the house. Clive's impulsiveness had never before seemed to
him such an admirable quality.

As he went into the street he became aware, from the excited state of the crowd, that something
had happened. Meeting a Sepoy he inquired, and learned  that Sirajuddaula had just been brought
into the city. The luckless Nawab had arrived in his boat close to Rajmahal, and with the recklessness
that  characterized him, he had gone ashore while his servants prepared a meal. Though disguised
in mean clothes he had been recognized by a fakir, who happened to be at the very spot where
he landed. The man had a grudge against him; his ears and nose had been cut off some time before
at the Nawab's order. Hastening into Rajmahal he had informed the governor, who sent a guard
at once to seize the unhappy prince and bring him to Murshidabad.

Before the next morning dawned Sirajuddaula was dead. Mir Jafar handed him to his son Miran
with strict orders to guard him. Acting on a mocking suggestion of Miran, a courtier named
Muhammad Beg took a band of armed men  to the Nawab's room, and hacked him to death. Next morning
his mutilated body was borne on an elephant's back through the streets, and it was known to
his former subjects that the prince who had ruled them so evilly was no more. Such was the
piteous end, in his twenty-sixth year, of Sirajuddaula.

"Bulger?"

"Yes. Didn't you know? Phyllis has taken a fancy to him; that hook of his appears to be a most

Desmond laughed a little awkwardly.
