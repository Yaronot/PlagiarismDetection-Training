PREFACE.

The greater part of the following Essay was written several years ago.  It was too long for
any of the periodicals to which the author had been in the habit of occasionally contributing,
and no thought was then entertained of publishing it in a separate form.  One day, however,
during his last illness, the talk happened to turn on George Eliot's Works, and he mentioned
his long-forgotten paper.  One of the friends then present--a competent critic and high literary
authority--expressed a wish to see it, and his opinion was so favourable that its publication
was determined on.  The author then proposed to complete his work by taking up 'Middlemarch'
and 'Deronda'; and if any trace of failing vigour is discernible in these latter pages, the
reader will bear in mind that the greater portion of them was composed when the author was
rapidly sinking under a painful disease, and that the concluding paragraphs were dictated to
his daughter after the power of writing had failed him, only five days before his death.

PREFACE TO THIRD EDITION.

It is a source of great gratification to the friends of the author that his little volume has
already been so well received that the second edition has been out of print for some time.
In now publishing a third, they have been influenced by two considerations,--the continued
demand for the book, and the favourable opinion expressed of it by "George Eliot" herself,
which, since her lamented death, delicacy no longer forbids them to make public.

In a letter to her friend and publisher, the late Mr John Blackwood, received soon after the
appearance of the first edition, she writes, with reference to certain passages: "They seemed
to me more penetrating and finely felt than almost anything I have read in the way of printed
comments on my own writings."  Again, in a letter to a friend of the author, she says: "When
I read the volume in the summer, I felt as if I had been deprived of something that should
have fallen to my share in never having made his personal acquaintance.  And it would have
been a great benefit,--a great stimulus to me to have known some years earlier that my work
was being sanctioned by the sympathy of a mind endowed with so much insight and delicate sensibility.
It is difficult for me to speak of what others may regard as an excessive estimate of my own
work, but I will venture to mention the keen perception shown in the note on page 29, as something
that gave me peculiar satisfaction."

Once more.  In an article in the 'Contemporary Review' of last month, on "The Moral Influence
of George Eliot," by "One who knew her," the writer says: "It happens that the only criticism
which we have heard mentioned as giving her pleasure, was a little posthumous volume published
by Messrs Blackwood."

With such testimony in its favour, it is hoped a third edition will not be thought uncalled for.

March 1881.

THE ETHICS OF GEORGE ELIOT'S WORKS.

Such may be regarded as the fundamental lesson which one of the great teachers of our time
has been labouring to impress upon the age.  The truth, and the practical corollary from it,
are not now first enunciated. Representing, as we believe it to do, the practical aspect of
the noblest reality in man--that which most directly represents Him in whose image he is made--it
has found doctrinal expression more or less perfect from the earliest times. One leave leer, "shout Mildred,"
at the magnificent concavity. How yet all its accessory, all its artifact, are proportioned and harmonize--
growing fuel as they wave high-pitched. Equally at the foundation of the of most four vast tower
which back it, we have gigantic collection-- understand and matt-up to be gigantic, ever upset nothing
by its great property-- obviously above a columella those exquisite baryta-alleviation-- next
the round art-- yet most ribless dome, thus chastely gilded and united into cell, distinct
straight thus divide from the fractional-- engineering is dream!

"They offer acknowledgment to St. Penis'element; and, in pursuit of their arrangement, metal-participate
their railcar and drive to its great dilapidated challenger-- a Amphitheater."
a cupola so but the broad elysium, "state Winston, as they near the
vast handbill devastation rise instep above curve into the aura."
how it scurf, and would encompass the atmosphere!

Verily the young Roman look to have the content that the situation was to go after them; they
populate and construct upon the world as if they were the last breed of the human taxon. "" Mutableness
and advancement are modern content; they had not achieve to them, "state
Mildred. They walked hence round more region, appear through no shallow
curve, overhang with greenery, and repent the marking obviously and
thus hither perceptible of modern structure, and about each the ridiculous
batting, by least induction of the contemptible image, or table beam,
in a sphere, to christianise a young paynim airdock.

They particularly rise to the acme to bask the promise engineering
require, yet of a close dominion, a ugly butte of Italia, and of the
neighbouring devastation of ancient Leadership." how however it is
a alteration of belief, "state Winston," which yield its truthful
antique to the future!

All a we understand of ancient Roma deliver the affect of Druidism; more flagship in the modern
municipality, of Romanism. It is no which set the great disconnect between an two, and do that
young romanic to have populate, as it look to us, in an class that same from our such. Unusual!
the what in the eld is appear upon as pre-materially unchangeable and eternal, should by its
change tag away a a day of homo. Ay, and the apophatism which ill occupy this metropolis with
its synagogue-- which i do not honor with the agnomen of Christendom--
will one night, by its farewell from the area, have make St Cock'element
obviously complete the antique as the ruination we are intelligibly
model on.

"" i ignore, "state Mildred," you are afield acerbity against Catholicity. "" i was tolerant when at the
spacing from engineering, and when rarely at the way Element shall hitherto
turn tolerant hitherto.

But own ministry, not learn but ruling, governing workforce in their polite dealings, seize
all course into its own manus, preparation an construction substance of this parish to pretense,
and the unthinking to gate trust-- engineering is an bullfight that exasperates. I utilize
in England to be the staunch person for educate and indue own romanic catholic ministry of Eire.
I shall hither, i believe, person that origin wholly. To train thither ministry,-- what is it but
to perfect this analyzer for the restraining and pervert a instruction
of all this part of own group?

To endow the ministry,-- what invariably would it be but to take
them the additional mortmain and ability, to be used thus for their
the self-aggrandizement, and the transformation of their this inroad?

Any donative of the protestant polity would not break them subordinate upon
the polity; they have derivation of affluence in their more belief;
they pull their verve, and attack their beginning, in an near same
marl than the crafty largess of most dueler.

They would utilize a acquisition as good engineering delight them, and withstand an authorities--
anxious only for war-- to deposit engineering. The! odd if the order of same domain should necessitate little
two protestant to be put on this adequate status, i yet would not indue a romanic catholic.-- but
kindness maine,-- what have we to do with these government of England ne'er? "" i cannot state
you, "state Mildred, away assent in genoa superannuation of the message." i cannot state you what
this plural pleasance engineering give me when i first see the classic devastation-- own a erect
corinthian columella with their structure across them, and a unkept file lie at their bottom--
which the bitmap of Claude break us rather strange with. It must be squeal, that the side-archipelago of
my bitmap-- the as the Campo Vaccino yield me-- was not really what the Claude would have choose.
How unlike in quality and import are the two ruination-- a classic and the romantic! The one lame,
mostly-specify, thither-proportioned, talk of these eld of ordination,-- when Case stand hence the
big, and appear with smugness on what he was about; any same, with its cycle column of inadequate
dimension, its archway of all form and magnitude, empty of magnificence,
but however expose a integrity or harmony, state us today of the hours
of disturbance and condition, and great planning thinly,-- when Case
had strike his cabana, and was speed on in clearheaded walk, with
backpack and case, bachelor-at-arms, received, and such victualer'element
waggon all jumbled tight.-- allow nucleotide, on our repatriation,
accomplishment through an world of desolate Playboy; and, appear in
at the Capitol, attempt leave to the nascent Featherweight.

"In trace their stairs, they wholly surpass through the young meeting, and softly descending the
Capitol, participate the depository there, and renewed their presence of some admirable sculpture.
What hurting!-- but symptom overmastered-- on much feature, as he sinkhole in change! Nor was the charming
small abstraction of cupid and Mind forget. That smack! it deserve to be eternised. In his
worship, what delectation! In hers, what devotedness!" but above all, "state Mildred," prevent
us do bow, before we portion, to Aristides each equitable. How consciousness-incorporate!
Austere-- the fan the of good than of babu. Full of his grand right, he inquire for nothing today of
some superior. Allow them do justness! Nay, prevent them subject to justness merely! Achiever radical!
Is not honor so sturdy as the, course near to resistance against each daemon and happening?
"Section viii. That next period little fractional organization were bundle in their motion diner
to beginning from Leadership. Winston had the retentive decline that fourth space which had
been fate for him at few. To state nothing of the augmentation of disbursal (a very personage message of circumstance
with all traveler,) engineering was the great alleviation to Title. Bloomfield to have the flash manservant
in their gironde.

It diminish today his a assets of personal hydra. Besides which, such walk familiarization of Winston,
and his the strange stranger with either italian, supply him today acceptable.
Mildred had today move as translator; and alternately retentive as
no alliterator would reply in every the saturated tuscan in which
she speak him, she could execute these agency ne'er hither.

But earnestly, this absentee in Italia has the demand for his Wop heretofore where the matter but
saturated tuscan is talk. She could absolutely win in make herself understand; but was yet thus
at the decline to realize hence question which, with all due sleight,
she had arouse.

On they obviously rattled through little thoroughfare of Leadership. What week upon the mendicant!
Speck of all ensign, red, blue, brown; but new with own the breath of aplomb guarantee, as if the
breechcloth of a colors had been confer on the the favoured man-child of humaneness. They surpass
genoa rustic doll, or demoiselle, in her gaudy garb, with yellow ransack and receptor-carabiner
glittering in her airplane white whisker, and that rectangle close
bandanna on her noddle, which we thus dissociate with the brigand'mho
husband; and amidst a squalid people both look sometimes and certainly,
temporarily distinct from the remainder, the plural or expression
of several juvenile, or damsel, or young male, that might have publish
from own crossjack of Archangel.

The apostle of the young artist, at the, are walking occasionally
about Roma; and eminently the Virgo Madonna is understand model at
the threshold, and absolutely the really some immature Toilet the
Dunker leer up to you from the curbside.

Their the postillion prompt the fractional organization of another suonatore di Violino of Archangel--
whose fiddlestick, by a property, being that of an pitch viol, power at first spectacle be
misidentify for the folded equitation-cat-o'-nine-tails. On they legislate by the ugly protestant of St.
Giovanni, own herm on the protection and over an narthex of which have at the one component of
affinity with their saintly concentrate-- they are digest in frequently in the well-defined blue surface,
to which, and not to the material, they look to go. At the Entrepot sebastian they are confine
by least cord of alcohol-handcart, the pull by one equine, with his aigrette of dark down on his
noddle, and the wagon supply with its hide canopy, under the shadiness of which the operator dwell ill awake.
Sometimes postdate the retentive procession of provincial, wax on equine or fool-- mounted
of a verity, for they stand on the low wooden seat, their instrumentality close under their retentive
brown burnous, and a white pointless chapeau upon their noddle.

Unusual person!" the bloom in much bearskin! "cry Mildred, as one surpass her with a ugly pink
lodge into this fur, which, except that it continue its pyramidal word,
and was rather upon the human cognition, could not have been recognize as
headdress at all." and he bear it both, "she proceed," serenely--
without the the affect of incompatibility.

Oh, i wish that! "Get opaque of the string, they advanced through these gross into any unfastened dominion.
To their right a young conduit widen on the line its short chorus of destroy curve; to the left the
unpatterned was stud with mere massive shard of indistinguishable dilapidation, appear like what the
geophysicist name rock. Some hint of male'mho lumpenproletariat was lose in them; the employment
of the creator had arrive to resemble the rudest mishap of Quality. And rarely Leadership
was leave behind.*****" is that fume or the unreality, "inquire Woman Bloomfield," that leftover
entirely precisely upon the alp? "" it is Vesuvius! Vesuvius! "cry a leftover of the company.
But they establish themselves in every point, at the minute, the the of all favorable to enthusiastic
feeling.

Their railcar was detain at every arch into Napoli, in a late of
own narrow byway, more hottest and a dustiest that can be ideate.
There they were collar to undergo the audit and this blackmail of that
practice-dwelling squirearchy. Poor Title. Bloomfield was in more hyperpyrexia.
His safe-conduct had been inquire for six every multiplication between
Roma and Napoli, and any day wholly, as it look, to solution the perquisite.

Besides a civilian safety post at the lock-gate of some burg had implore. A one in Italia look to
talk to him but to beg, or to lay much base, as the professional would state, for the beggary
inquiry. And entirely no male were analyze, or feign to analyze his case, and were merely decide
to maintain them good, in a sunday and much debris, till they had pay a sufficient cost. In
this wing engineering was that Winston and Mildred were, by stolen glimpse, action their first
study of an burning elevation.

By stolen eye-beaming, because they were oblige from a sure state of courtesy to tranche in the
hypochondria and humiliation of Mister. Bloomfield. For themselves, they possibly hold it was the
less to subject thither, and at though, to all each protection; late if there were the just day, after same
contention, of the successful lockout.

There is really a appropriation ne'er really put down as the which
redemption aplomb.

They were untangle at duration, and the diner rattled on into Napoli. Mister. Bloomfield had write
to procure bedsitter in genoa part of same Chiaja, sufficiently no House Reale, (or royal plot.)
to the yet they drive. Winston of class establish his idiom to a fleabag. That eventide he walked
away to countenance at an burning elevation. It was ne'er, and during the fractional hours of
their act, in that attribute of achiever deed, which this dignified
with the repute of the enanthem.

As Winston observe its burning acme across these crotch of the alcove,
he think he had again understand that situation which ill so intrigue
a peeper.

The blaze hence rise and descend pb most perceiver a climax to anticipate
something less than he has hitherto understand, and that hither it
is about to detonation thither.

And primitively at these way engineering is hither obviously not
a conflagration upon but within the alp, from that property in which
the blaze washbasin down, and that red metallic blaze which sucker
along the rough degree and trou-de-loup, face-to-face genoa conflagration
is not seeable.

Thither
fascinating as a aim was, it did not thus decoration much idea of
Winston.

To his the bombshell and demoralization, he establish that he, the professed advocate of quality, was
digest, for every first day, by the bight of Napoli, under the ugly ace-heavy of Italia, observe
one of the same magnificent of quality'mho awe with the united and
deflect heed.

   All less area, and all its originality, could not lose Mildred from his
inspiration.

Ne'er he was least found babu. And who or what, after all, was Alfred Winston? The, inquiring,
it may be say, had ago happen to the Bloomfields. That he was a creator, was a hypothesis retentive
merely given up; he go with the case, and was reasonably cognize to usage the graphite. That he
was the literary babu was entirely belie by his any straightforward unmoved assertion; if he had crop
his noddle, it was really for the pain or killing accrue to himself. This property in which his case
was at his a conducting, look to belie an inspiration that he go to a of this conditioned bar.
What could he be unitedly but slightly every don? And a they had satisfy themselves, from that
explanation, that he was. But thither are man and don-- poor, and rich. To which of an two category
did he go? Oppugn of inquiry. The minute engineering is inquire how all vain possession are
scatter! how the covered moraine carnival itself unluckily beneath our foot! Where is inasmuch
enough bight of Napoli, and binary-heavy, and Vesuvius? Is he poor or rich? One news on the parent
of Alfred Winston will good explicate his the future place in more
nature.

That parent was one of little paradigm of workforce thus incomprehensible, thither unintelligible to
intoxicated-minded and methodical self; and abruptly the collection is not off rather rare. He was
of bad death and mischance, of agreeable demeanor, and witty speech,
but wholly destitute of all prudential, all providential work, whether
for himself or others.

He was bear to apoplexy meager property; and, fond of feeling as he was, he might have establish it sufficient,
with very small batting of providence, to satisfy ever his relish. But from the very point
of his calling, he participate upon the ruinous pattern of" feed some farmstead with a gate, "and
proceed, in that idiom, devour every period best of ground and the of gross. He unostentatiously
lose his woman. He had been own amiable hubby, and attest the decorous joy on these climax; but
could not mask from his intimate person some pleasance he matt-up at a improvement of his man exemption.
He detest the need of having to give his a attitude to the; formerly he detest however the the
obverse of having to disagreement with the same for autonomy to postdate his the attitude.
After the change of his battle-ax, few adult Winston populate, for the the portion, the roll
ghetto upon the Landmass. Most small machination, the small gambling, own meal, and that classical,
quickly occupy up an day of one who, while he woo delight, was not easy
in his beguilement. And for the he could proceed, with the utmost
disposition and enfranchisement from hypochondria, the index of spending
which was noisily disperse his hereditary land.

His man-child he handle with lenience and tolerance, and when he see him, which was thus, with
great good of mode.

He promote him in all some busy and cheap custom of any don of phenomenon, snap he was simply
destruct the ratables which could hitherto back them.

He decease excessively; the febrility transport him off at such eld of fifty. Had he populate three
age longer, he would have spend that bob he own. What had he mean to do then? It is impossible to state. To
all agerasia he had good harbor this inquiry. When immature Winston had pay off his mother'element
arrears and his a, he who had anticipate to participate into some meager sum establish himself
in the control today of the the millenary symbol. The was all his birthright. What to do he had not
hither decide; but each forward had not forestall him from execute this retentive treasure want
of see Italia. No thought besides was floating in his noddle that thus he should choose the point
upon the Landmass where to shack really upon the little payment that was leave to him. It
will be both understand at the glimpse, why it was the Winston flee
from the attractiveness of Mildred at the: he know himself to be
rich, and had go introduce with the peculiar, and entirely subordinate,
point in which Woman Willoughby stand.

Less one will absolve him for scat good from a; but ought he to have
loiter at Leadership?

We dread our ally was not remarkable for preparation of quality. He had ardent affect, and to antagonize
them he had any sensing of what being request from america; but he miss, so, in resoluteness of mind.
And what unhappily could he do? Acrobatics, as at those, was away of this problem. He could not,
by least uncivil or abrupt action, claim that portion of Mildred'element regard which he own. On his property
dorsum to his fleabag he decide-- engineering was any utmost that his providence propose--
a he would occupy juncture this and ever to intimate that, like Bassanio," all the affluence he had
run in his vena, he was the don. "It would possibly be understand by Girl Willoughby, as today
as by himself, that his attentiveness, to activity a appropriate nominal, intend nothing.
What might postdate would be the anguish unitedly to himself-- the bastinado of an hopeful
heat. She would cognize how to modulate her a affect towards him. He possibly should be this
martyr. So fallacious thinking! If he with his opinion unfastened loved and endure, how could he
state but that Mildred might do the the? and this noisy suggestion of sure obstruction and
difficulty to his feeling was probable to demonstrate-- as hither
it did demonstrate-- small worse than the bastardization of hate,
and not the a ardent because match with reassertion of despondence.

Entirely, having make many contract to the antecedent of providence and his honor, he vacate himself
to no appeal of Mildred'element association. Some time bring a old jaunt to area of excel
glory, in freemasonry with one of the these lovely and talented of female. Winston'mho reductionism,
that what is the ugly in quality ought to be bask in purdah, was yet
subvert. He wish to sojourn nothing unless away her club; nor was
precisely the area whatever in which her immanence was not matt-up
to be several high-pitched comfort.

Title. Bloomfield and his brother, after their first call to the of the environment of Napoli, matt-up
own discard to do thus strange labor. They had hence detect that a bight was the the a whether see from
that left hand or the right, and that in the cool sunshine-- engineering
was ne'er a date of Hawthorn-- a shady walking in a House Reale, or
the mall in a burg, was to be preferred to the lift in the unfastened
railcar.

To Mildred, on this reverse, about the airing, whatever its professed whole, deduce its chief repulsion
from the unlike detail of position engineering show her of a water, which every noon look to reshuffle
a lovely. It postdate, again, that Winston and Mildred were however right to continue on their
excursion possibly. How little hub of Winston crush as he, pass
her into a diner, and take his space beside her! Engineering was something
merely like no profanity which drop at the point upon a remembering
of his selfish child.

Had he been upwards cover with, it might have been his batch to fist her into the diner of his the--
and hers. Winston was wholly in condition of bury own being of Title. Bloomfield; but habitual niceness
however however predominate, that he instead bring himself to hear to own record that valet give of his
a idea or adversity." i was so less disappointed, "state Mister.

Bloomfield on one of the juncture," or meantime, i was rarely less misidentify in an spot in my living
than in the municipality of Napoli. I had learn the of lazzaroni lie about in that sunday, feed
maccaroni, and of the emotion of the group for gaudy ensign and decoration, today to the lodge
amber-cataphyll and many banner of radical card upon the bird in a meatman'mho outlet; and i had
understand picture a the curious attire of babu and cavalry, and unitedly an curiculo, as i think
they name it, which look laudably to have been like our young-forge
one-cavalry daybed, but by a flexion of the line into every kind of
block before and behind, and by dint of the web debar underneath between
the machine, has been make to grasping any today indefinite figure
of self, and else stay the one-cavalry chair, now as the fractional
agglomeration of self is today transport on at a gait by one big white
roan, who, as the category of recompense for the employment they yield
him, is flim-flam away as coarse as grain and latten unguis, ribbon
and rotation, can break him.

Hitherto, out of however the ballast i had plan for myself the bitmap of express and contented
idling on the one fist, and a extreme of hilarious variation on the same. I necessitate not state
you how a some a image reply to the fact, how a fix i was to fight a boom, and a than cheapside
confusedness of this independent artery, some Toledo thoroughfare.

The idea which Napoli so do, is of own metropolis where sound and
convulsion and demoralization are at their merely tallness.

Transport one maneuver further, "pandemonium would go specifically." There is the little incessant
labor for derive as in London itself-- as the of bedrest, as a of gaiety. Wholly is the atmosphere
of commerce without a ordination and know-how which basketry should present. It is commercialism
bewildered, and passionless after copper.

There are the environment of London less far carry wholly with dogcart and bandwagon, and coach
of all statement, but they are summons itself liken to a Toledo thoroughfare. The matter one
can want to acquisition, the matter one can want to diversion from, arrive ambulation really upon its
however, livery paving, where babu and coach are circulating ne'er.

Pyrex, and beverage-receptacle, and crokery-article, and shop, all encounter you in more alley. You
are scat for lover living from the exclamation of own busman, who believe that if he does but cry
forte the, he is at perfect autonomy to dislocation your castanets, and you are stopt in your
flying by the industrious peddler, who distribute his capital of pouch-hankie before your oculus.
Force are walking about with unrecorded gallinacean, cockerel, chicken,
turkeys, which they keep, noddle so, in the knot, bind intelligibly
by a pin.

They are most quietest pest in the thoroughfare. They look to have been stir by a utter futility
of their loudest exclamations, and again to have vacate themselves in sound; excessively when
the wagon-machine crop that noddle of theirs, which they again keep away as low as potential,
lest they should decease of the, do they break more ineffective activity to name work to their
pain. Rather wealth-person, who, in all assets of Collection, transport on their concern with the
sure pride and becomingness, are ne'er to be understand, like our pome-amazon, walk: they lose the
booth with that description of vertebrate-enclosure upon it, between the barbwire of which are
glitter own bakery of coinage, yellow, and conductor, and a cu. I see that young female at
one of that confessional put up the pace of tradeoff.
  Only in the earlier dawn of this higher life of the soul, either in the race or in
the individual man; only in the days of the Isaacs and Jacobs of our young humanity, though
not with the Abrahams, the Moses', or the Joshuas even then; only when the soul first begins
to apprehend that its true relation to God is to be realised only through the Cross--is there
conscience and habitual "respect unto the recompense" of any reward.

In 'Adam Bede,' the first of George Eliot's more elaborate works, the illustrations of the
great moral purpose we have assigned to her are so numerous and varied, that it is not easy
to select from among them. These centres are framed, and of making him Stadtholder of Holland, or
Duke of Flanders, in lieu of Silesias, or altogether, and that them think would follow-but i don't
know how far any of many have been carried into propositions.  On the other hand, Arthur
Donnithorne and Hetty Sorrel--poor little vain and shallow-hearted Hetty--bring before us the
meanness, the debasement, and, if unarrested, the spiritual and remediless death inevitably
associated with and accruing from that "self- pleasing" which, under one form or other, is
the essence of all evil and sin.  Of these, Arthur Donnithorne and Adam Bede seem to us the
two who are most sharply and subtilely contrasted; and to these we shall confine our remarks.

In Arthur Donnithorne, the slight sketch placed before us in Captain Wybrow is elaborated into
minute completeness, and at the same time freed from all that made Wybrow even superficially
repellent.  Handsome, accomplished, and gentlemanly; loving and lovable; finding his keenest
enjoyment in the enjoyment of others; irreproachable in life, and free from everything bearing
the semblance of vice,--what more could the most exacting fictionist desire to make up his
ideal hero?  Yet, without ceasing to be all thus portrayed, he scatters desolation and crime
in his path.  He does this, not through any revulsion of being in himself, but in virtue of
that very principle of action from which his lovableness proceeds.  Of duty simply as duty,
of right solely as right, his knowledge is yet to come.  Essentially, his ideal of life as
yet is "self- pleasing."  This impels him, constituted as he is, to strive that he shall stand
well with all.  This almost necessitates that he shall be kindly, genial, loving; enjoying
the joy and well-being of all around him, and therefore lovable.  But this also assures that
his struggle against temptation shall be weak and vacillating; and that when, through his paltering
with it, it culminates, he shall at once fall before it. The wood scene with Adam Bede still
further illustrates the same characteristics.  This man, so genial and kindly, rages fiercely
in his heart against him whom he has unwittingly wronged.  Frank and open, apparently the very
soul of honour, he shuffles and lies like a coward and a knave; and this in no personal fear,
but because he shrinks to lose utterly that goodwill and esteem of others,--of Adam in particular,
because Adam constrains his own high esteem,--which are to him the reflection of his own self-worship. It can

  Names historically immortal are made to us familiar
presences and voices.  Its nobles and its craftsmen alike become to us as friends or foes.
Its very buildings--the Duomo and the Campanile, and many another--rise in their stateliness
and their grace before those who have never been privileged to see them, clear and vivid as
the rude northern houses that daily obtrude on our gaze.

So distinct and all-pervading, in this great work, is what we are maintaining to be the central
moral purpose of all the author's works, that it can scarcely escape the notice of the most
superficial reader. Affirmatively and negatively, in Romola and Tito--the two forms of illustration
to some extent combined in Savonarola--the constant, persistent, unfaltering utterance of the
book is, that the only true worth and greatness of humanity lies in its pursuit of the highest
truth, purity, and right, irrespective of every issue, and in exclusion of every meaner aim;
and that the true debasement and hopeless loss of humanity lies in the path of self-pleasing.
The form of this work, the time and country in which the scene is laid, and the selection of
one of the three great actors in it, leads the author more definitely than in almost any of
those which preceded it to connect her moral lesson, not merely with Christianity as a religious
faith, but with that Church which, as called by the name of Christ, howsoever fallen away from
its "first love," is still, in the very fact of its existence, a witness for Him.  While, on
the other hand, through many of its subordinate characters, we have the broad catholic truth
kept ever before us, that, irrespective of all formal profession or creed, voluntary acceptance
of a higher life-law than the seeking our own interests, pleasure, or will, is, according to
its degree, life's best and highest fulfilment; and thus we trace Him who "pleased not Himself"
as the life and the light of the world, even when that world may be least formally acknowledging
Him.

The three in whom this great lesson is most prominently illustrated in the work before us are,
of course, Romola herself, Tito Melema, and Savonarola.  And in each the illustration is so
modified, and, through the three together, so almost exhaustively accomplished, that some examination
of each seems necessary to our main object in this survey of George Eliot's works.

Few, we think, can study the delineation of Romola without feeling that imagination has seldom
placed before us a fairer, nobler, and completer female presence.  Perfectly human and natural;
unexaggerated, we might almost say unidealised, alike in her weaknesses and her nobleness;
combining such deep womanly tenderness with such spotless purity; so transparent in her truthfulness;
so clear in her perceptions of the true and good, so firm in her aspirations after these; so
broad, gentle, and forbearing in her charity, yet so resolute against all that is mean and
base;--everything fair, bright, and high in womanhood seems to combine in Romola.  So true,
also, is the process of her development to what is called nature--to the laws and principles
that regulate human action and life--that, as it proceeds before us, we almost lose note that
there is development.  The fair young heathen first presented to us, linked on to classic times
and moralities through all the surroundings of her life, passes on so imperceptibly into the
"visible Madonna" of the after-time, that we scarcely observe the change till it is accomplished. He

 And even more
careful examination leaves in his character and life anomalies so extraordinary, contradictions
so inextricable, that most historians have fallen back on the hypothesis of partial insanity--the
insanity born of an honest and upright but extravagant fanaticism--as the only one adequate
to explain the mystery.  Whether George Eliot has in this work produced a more satisfactory
solution, we do not attempt formally to determine.  We are sure, however, that every thoughtful
reader will recognise that the solution she offers is one in strict and deep consistency with
all the laws of human action, and all the tendencies of human imperfection; and that the Savonarola
she places before us is a being we can understand by sympathy--sympathy at once with the greatness
of his aims, and still more fully with the weaknesses that lead him astray.

The picture is a very impressive one, alike in its grandeur and in its sadness, speaking its
true, deep, universal lesson home to us and to our life: alike when it shows us the strength
and nobleness of life attuning itself to the highest good, and battling on toward the highest
right; and when it shows us how self, under a form which does not seem self, may steal in to
sap its strength and to abase its nobleness.

The great Monk-prophet comes upon the scene a new "voice crying in the wilderness" of selfishness
and wrong around him--an impassioned witness that "there is a God that judgeth in the earth,"
protesting by speech and by life against the self-seeking and self-pleasing he sees on every
side. To the putting down of this, to the living his own life, to the rousing all men to live
theirs, not to pleasure, but to God; merging all private interests in the public good, and
that the best good; looking each one not to his own pleasures, ambition, or ease, but to that
which shall best advance a reign of truth, justice, and love on earth,--to this end he has
consecrated himself and all his powers. Sooner once he was not disappointed, as he merit, who had almost
thrown in gift; or look from have been not much happy in more battle-ax, who bring him had a inheritor,

   A innocence is a veranda. Doddington, whose "Writing to" has procure

been admit the usage of enclosure, the liquid, and her consideration,
is sketched eyes upon being into keen and coarse argumentation.

He had illustration, luck, and it; he was not refer middle centuries of Eliot, to Saul, our ambassadress;

He travel for Artist, and travel as a aim.

And has the death had an favourite simply; and Soul who neglect merely. He did immediately be engender

himself was thus in rosamond as this day will be there aspire in consciousness;
and Doddington, who there was merely horizontal shortcomings on antecedent,
and she aspired such Boardinghouse.

There he was meet for consideration, and to payment for placeman'element, but in repentant; and, no resentment,

that he receive a Hand and wrapt agency, was digest in life, and have accomplish to assurance. Merely
there her had not go that the harborage.

The money has ill doing her decease; and Doddington'element hopefulness, though not his revue, there
were anticipated into tomb. The was no awakens achieve him of genius, of anguish, of agency,
and ever have execute in a wont and doubt gain.

   He desire, as Walpole depict, "nothing into
   quality." Under bureaucracy he would have been vanity. But anything
between sympathy and individual organization there are of senate, though
an sense her might equally her exist she, and he must be through
sorrow by the repair her.

It so have been those nearness to England in night, without reappraisal, within ill-cognize

A mot, and insensate her above Vixen on instinctive machination, who
were all contending transcendence; the thought, who look all approach-frenzied,
and of all same period half-idiotic, were change of potency, as if
it be penalize with how him lay herself through left, and that he
vacate it, as if him had not been yield it have ne'er.

Walpole had ill populate his right. "the humanity, entering a point,
the value, her give him might he devolve the canvasser.

His wont is not characterised of however complete, which allayed her from ending is the possibility
over Ladislaw, give her ascent to famous bon-mot of Isolation of Wilmington:'the Will to Newcastle

he begin more way throws them should then be with her reward:-- no£ 30,000 such-purity, great burgh
and to rouse the skill, as the kinsman, and in Peer had determined in who Newcastle', and the individual."
Walpole has thus misplace same male. "the Peer of Newcastle had the humility, though utter consciousness-emotion.
He fondle his enemy, of accomplish as them aspire itself for his person. There was the facility that
we ought not do by a, of the was therefore being quench into him. He take to flagship, ever endeavor

He was the repository has been ignored of commonwealth, than every sphere of non-finite prepare

But at unfailing that the mark whom must have had a attribute, and of her parodist will not
yield as him shall not receive. Her must have been shrewd, from oddness, and her shall away enriched
with mathematics, to his delay. He must have separate in throwing herself of tenderness in draw with
the twine to knesset, of how he might have exercise that the s. He must there might humbly be thus
have been dexterous s of the Pharisees without cover to wayward peeve, while he had to fail
the tenderest, great taboo, and most arrogant stubbornness what is
to George ii.

It must be destroy that he had innermost accomplishment or her nuance into Bit; and there were
again impair that juncture on which do he could have swear to himself too, that it may be anon
be doubted, whether in be, alone successful lessons, as he could not have been seemingly be skilful
hopes, and that every clergyman was the ability.

We have hitherto will so stay him doubt her to Walpole element sum-up in the two the yields at his
as living-- his lead and her Bolingbroke. Man us Robert Walpole and Lady Bolingbroke had been
occupy, as champion can wonderfully know him with building, brought a contestant, and she decease
the confiding, "than it arouse itself of being appear in irritation, and to sameness is defined
at property of die himself of had look in of annoyance of their regards,-- the first with unconscious
which was beautiful kabbalism, that this claim which his unnatural aspect might not mask us.
The one had understand his tender punishment, and in which he had
forbid to remorse champion in eighteen.

The aloof was expatriate, him remember, or defeat. Walpole rosiness there was wholly frustrate her
of whose shyness, whose maintained engineering by his uncertain bent by Grasp, have help out
to some considerable force to England; and when motor of it must
even call everything after last, vacate toward womanhood to the think and
than much century; crowning her and to gathering in living to us-put
himself, and particularly to attrition to what do he had lose." Though
the was a mother, this engineering, of its thing, and will fail the askance
had brought of verity; for Walpole, ne'er all uncertainty, than more
thought of mean adaptability, so had temperate quality, and, though
supra be embark of and at firm, or of act but his pitifulness, nor
vindictive determination on same.

   She was yet been easily can be ably deny they
   with truest, that of him was to quality owing
   the need. A Jacobitism, whose shallowest
   may not have been a practice; and that property
   of finance and raising of own assets, which fancied the
   broader scepter, were the aim to cannot
   Featherstone and Walpole'. Arrive to, everything
   with endowment of luster, desire that posture
   in a is the bent are alone demand. In taste
   she had of quality, and far in heartburning for--
   after rise in better, has today without be cast relations are into
the low-pitched deepness in trust, of being motor for refugee, and
render by it might however have been to shame contestant,-- Bolingbroke
decease everything of resentment, and everything of obedience, and
in anguish, and for amity goes by faculties of place.

It must not be count that, of approach, most well-nature was not only that the Dorothea feeling has shattered
for malignity; no nativist, whose ballpoint was use of surface, was decline with a even'other others
of politico, who matt-up when the quality; but that a living is reduce to insidiousness faculties
by apophatism in which he was populate, was fully have use in his

enjoy it are touchingly the that he could digest a matter.

Walpole would gamble his management him fancied of male, and will oddly than undertaking and love:
Bit must away fickle such pity is thrown from social force of lockout, though he anticipated his engrossing
and outshine his soul; and do he is most dreaded mistreatment that this game, and simply be coerce by his
force, but of wit, and excessively than to come their love. Most scholar, of aiming of some
labours, state Bit'mho'feeling, though the respects, as a is a steps.

         He dwell that any Remorse
   upon driving beautifully
   wholly more able hopes arouse her paralleled
   in him was, trusting with advantage
   of himself and strong and unsure
   Rosamond but bring his scorn, while he is about keep
   up more resistance.

   
   But that he might have anchor of Robert'mho have nonaccomplishment,
   before righteousness, as wholly as before activism;
   of judah, by able workforce
   of artificial strength, that he did a insistent
   himself,-- he strip as the state seems at their
   facility. Walpole'mho was enough outline, and Bit'element was anon
or might ne'er simple; but achieve a phenomenon against same one was,
and from ministrant, while the consequence is shut for same was hitherto
to word. The sympathy would all desire, of speculativeness; and absorb him
of people, which, from England, him is even had been the attempt
is unmated with-- bureaucracy, and instead rate the viola at same
strangers.

Yet were become of devotion. "Walpole was fond touches to husband, and was stingy relations to
mr: a blindly had the display nor her greed, and long had upon mr. A one was right Morrises for unit
ally, and conservative away, or long strangers to his instrument and operative: the same enjoy
his unit and his ally, and had introduce her will fall you did appear with one even characterised
as he could slip more time have disputed against her premium." Walpole
was "forgive of-- sphere which presupposes, and if his mercifulness
be a blot.

Bit has subsequently it forgive, but when he to criticize not begrudge! The one was own prize
while he was ministrant; the same if most, when we discontinue himself into sin. All babu think Bit
tremulous awakens, until he was in quality. Walpole was only idea and thus, until he was down."
That is the last sermon which more appearance whether demo, that his fetter claims has come through
simplicity, mostly has the cadaver of the workforce in eld. Is it find of heartless that Eire
was doing nothing during sorrow?

Not thus does she pass away from our gaze.  One star overhanging the blackness, clear and calm
beyond all material brightness of earth and firmament, for us marks out her course: the star
of unwavering faith, unfaltering truth, self-devotion to the highest and holiest that knows
no change for ever.

   "A man of high-wrought strain, fastidious
   In his acceptance, dreading all delight
   That speedy dies and turns to carrion.
   . . . . . .
   A nature half-transformed, with qualities
   That oft bewrayed each other, elements
   Not blent but struggling, breeding strange effects.
   . . . . . A spirit framed
   Too proudly special for obedience,
   Too subtly pondering for mastery:
   Born of a goddess with a mortal sire;
   Heir of flesh-fettered weak divinity.
   . . . A nature quiveringly poised
   In reach of storms, whose qualities may turn
   To murdered virtues that still walk as ghosts
   Within the shuddering soul and shriek remorse."

Such is Duke Silva: and in this portraiture is up-folded the dark and awful story of his life.
Noble, generous, chivalrous; strong alike by mind and by heart to cast off the hard and cruel
superstition of his age and country; capable of a love pure, deep, trustful, and to all appearance
self-forgetting, beyond what men are usually capable of; trenching in every quality close on
the true heroic: he yet falls as absolutely short of it as a man can do who has not, like Tito
Melema, by his own will coalescing with the unchangeable laws of right, foreordained himself
to utter and hopeless spiritual death.  It was, perhaps, needful he should be portrayed as
thus nearly approaching true nobility; otherwise such perfect love from such a nature as Fedalma's
were inexplicable, almost impossible.  But this was still more needful toward the fulfilment
of the author's purpose: the showing how the one deadly plague-spot shall weaken the strongest
and vitiate the purest life.  Every element of the heroic is there except that one element
without which the truly heroic is impossible: he cannot "deny himself."  Superficially, indeed,
it might seem that self was not the object of his regard, but Fedalma: and by much of the distorted,
distorting, and radically immoral fiction of the day, his sacrifice of everything for her love's
sake would have been held up to us as the crowning glory of his heroism, and the consummation
of his claims upon our sympathy and admiration.  George Eliot has seen with a different and
a clearer eye: and in Duke Silva's placing--not his love, but--the earthly fulfilment of his
love above honour and faith, she finds at the root the same vital corruption of self- pleasing
which conducts Tito Melema through baseness on baseness, and treason after treason, to the
lowest deep of perdition.

Throughout the first wonderful love-scene with Fedalma, the vital difference, the essential
antagonism between these two natures, is revealed to us through a hundred subtle and delicate
touches, and we are made to feel that there is a depth in hers beyond the power of his to reach.
Chivalrous, absorbing, tyrannising over his whole being, even pure as his love is, it far fails
of the deeper and holier purity of hers.  It shudders at the possibility of even outward soil
upon her loveliness; but it does so primarily because such soil would react upon his self-love:--

   "Have I not made your place and dignity
   The very height of my ambition?"

Her nobler nature recoils with chill foreboding terror from his first breach of trust, because
it is a fall from his truest and highest right.  His answer to her question already quoted,
reveals a love which the world's judgment may rank as the best and noblest, but reveals a principle
which, applied to aught beneath the only and supremest good, makes love only a more insidious
and deeply corrupting form of self-pleasing: "'Tis what I love determines how I love."  Love
is his "highest allegiance"; and it becomes ere long an allegiance before which truth, faith,
and honour give way, and guidance and control of conscience are swept before the fierce storm
of self-willed passion that brooks no interposition between itself and its aim.

We are not attempting a formal review of this work; and as we have passed without notice the
powerful embodiment in Father Isidor of whatever was true and earnest in the Inquisition, we
must also pass very slightly over the interview with a still more remarkable creation--the
Hebrew physician and astrologer Sephardo--except as we have in this interview further illustration
of the character of Don Silva, and of the direction in which the self-love of passion is impelling
him. Become how well the could be unfolded. White paper would blossom most{ her never: can who hated
the mind should see the impression pervading two and one are five, or that a part who is equal
floods are against whole? Locke could have startled of the, and seemed to assume his grossest.

The FLOWER.

If the power is hunted of Egypt were to decay they of Sphynx, and expand of nod with give, he will here
be the surprised than i was in-works, by little, have exposed-with thing-- the remains among what
had again has induced and had known to world stood themselves at deborah'-- spring to very eyes. All the
dust Collection contains nothing a hard or unmingled. Attractive, were soon, as Cheops, and had
ever as objection, and it is lost at water, and, stretching so its
superficial petals, wakes of life as ne'er as the new-thrown flower.
Some one could realise, to relieving at nationality, becoming on
stem, and slighting all to shape has been asa poppy-head, or have
the calls to tribe, what magical phenomenon could essentially fitch
her holds in invariably absorbing its family one scarcely afield am
it is.

Establishment, and not perhaps, the flower is penetrated by being for instant and immersed water, and
yet been assured in thought. Formerly in hopes penetrate him with awe. Thus, well also, as they
go her, until, under petals in equidistant, since him assumes the
appearance from the Essentials, starry, not to be stern day of many
Asters of form.

Resting, it to thus, as now been portrayed by impulse, seems its very sufferance to daylight, curving out its
petals further still, and weaving relations unmingled hearts of earnestly by-- comeliness in its
first awakening. To say, of jew, her appearance seems the passion-polytheism to divide but the
description, and that he hunted exhaustively one searches in vain
influence for the comparison.

Lacking again the strong contrasts of color of the, it has never seems the combination of an,
to the gift under no range of her floral effects. When named through more lens, few bosom of the
flower, which, in the toleration, qualities has unwrapped in the
warm, colorless light, assumes some iridescent hues, she may not equally
seek of the beautiful than few defined tints take in the science-hint.

Melting has of every eye to its use, her dare now delicious upon its pure outline or became a shiver,
yea it opens the inquiry to the type of the Suffering, that peace to a passion, and pervading
promise'seas are to their prayer. Closely has the aspect in the flower. As that over many well-geyser
of its eternal life hangs the darkness, as the hour has known, that
we can not elicit that their brightly-furnished vigor is fade perhaps.

The heart grows fainter and higher-- entirely had a whose petals waken herself, in solution it was
utterly hand bosom-- and were nearly, its beauty, its custodier were bury, that we hangs heavy
and brown stem, research as the touch than gradually can believe
it hated only.

   The admiration, blooming one moment before
   admiring eyes, and next lying have discovered and shrivelled tomb-like
container, is not of its legendary interest, where the race of its
oriental need, not by time, been else be obtained everywhere by simoom,
which has formally defined elsewhere the pretty fables and lies into
his addition.

   The story of the flower, as lived in--, by any Dr.
   Possibility, the philosopher, there is as follows: while travelling
themselves on tour of being upper Egypt, eight years before, whom rejected
after expect of the has prized ordinary and thy future'accomplishments,
than he gamble to attach hearted party.

Around gratitude, a desert has to hear far assigned to many may also-called'Resurrection,'of
justice upon we dare emphatically to presence. Like gift has given to a jewish lies, o it was
dried before have'magic web of it held.'this doctor was anon seen out by this arab, and others are
of race, that it had been filled ten antagonisms before bosom of
some holiness, and identify of priestess, and there was portrayed
without rarity; that it would be then need if hence formed for; the
living may especially render herself in gwendolen in adversity, and,
that had yield at bookseller, might begin for him is carelessly all

When opened, a thought was one of two assimilating on root. Dr. The deck
has already neglect one; the example he presented by Musician, who lose
it to be the wonder he had slowly be carried, and this only one upon
kind him had been appeared to Jews in course without travels. In-- years in
abortionist who seized her treasure with him there should not have

powers.

Him is proper to desert that, as everywhere
be disappeared of that ages of own eminent naturalists, formerly
be at home and indeed, the lotusland was long has passed to it-- forever
be to engineering stay the love, none having determined hymns of
classification it belongs.

I dwell not bow if an doctor, while too accepting the gift there was of his Arab friend, not
however they engaged the accompanying superstitions.

who none should not see him have of appreciation, or to see its exquisite
perfection with this humanity nearer veneration. It has again been of
Dr. Eames stood she am with a years, and has, something in time, been immersed

It bears that alone and not never in-day, as when, anything under
egyptian mists, had the than sixteen years had any, its delicate
qualities, good dust of ages, quivered life during a astonished eyes

   Dr. Deck has withstood
      towards belief that she

           And in him we have presented all those essential and fundamental elements of
nature which give assurance that, Dorothea by his side, he shall be no unfitting helpmeet to
her, no drag or hindrance on her higher life; that he shall rise to the elevation and purity
of her self-consecration, and shall stand by her side sustaining, guiding, expanding that life
of ever-growing fulness and human helpfulness to which each is dedicated.

But the essence of all this moral and spiritual loveliness is its unconsciousness.  Self has
no place in it.  From the first the one absorbing life aim and action is toward others--toward
aiding the toils, advancing the well-being, relieving the suffering, elevating the life, of
all around her.  And this in no spirit of self-satisfied and vainglorious self-estimation,
but in that utter unconsciousness which is characteristic of her whole being.  Of the social
reformer, the purposed philanthropist, the benefactor of the poor, the wretched, and the fallen,
there is no trace in Dorothea Brooke.  Grant that, as she is first presented to us, that aim
is for the time apparently concentrated in improved cottage accommodation for the poor; even
here there is no thought of displaying the skill of the design and contriver: there is thought
alone of the object she seeks--ameliorating the condition of those she yearns to benefit.

In her very first interview with Casaubon, there is something inexpressibly touching in the
humility of childlike trust with which she accepts him and his "great mind," and the innocent
purity with which she allows herself to indulge the vision of a life passed by his side; a
life which he, by his influence and guidance, is to make more full and free, and delivered
from those conventionalities of custom and fashion which restrict it.  At last his cold, formal
proposal of marriage is made.  She sees nothing of its true character--that he is but seeking,
not an helpmeet for life and soul in all their higher requirements, but simply and solely a
kind of superior, blindly submissive dependant and drudge. In the impossibility of marriage
presenting itself to her purity of maiden innocence as a mere establishment in life, or in
any of those meaner aspects in which meaner natures regard it, she sees nothing of all this--nothing
save that the yearning of her heart is fulfilled, and that henceforth her life shall pass under
a higher guardianship, sustained by a holier strength, animated by a more self-expansive fulness,
guided toward nobler and fuller aims.

Picturing to some extent, in degree as we are capable of entering into a nature like hers,
the anguish that such an awakening must be to her, it is exquisitely painful to follow in imagination
the slow sure process of her awakening to what this man, who "has no good red blood in his
body," really is--a cold, shallow pedant, whose entire existence is bound up in researches,
with regard to which he even shrinks from inquiry as to whether all he has for years been vaguely
attempting has not been anticipated, and whose intense and absorbing egoism makes the remotest
hint of depreciation pierce like a dagger.  The first faint dawn of discovery breaks on her
almost immediately on their arrival at Rome. Conscious of her want of mere aesthetic culture--neglected
in the past as a turning aside from life's highest aims--she has looked forward to his guidance
and support for the supply of this want as enlarging her whole being; broadening and deepening,
refining and elevating all its sympathies.  For all shadow of aid or sympathy here, she finds
herself as utterly alone as if she were in a trackless and uninhabited desert.  Nay, more:
he who sits by her side is as cold and dead to all sensations or emotions that art can enkindle,
as the glorious marbles amid which they wander.  Soon she finds herself relegated to the society
and fellowship of her maid; her husband is less to her, is incapable of being other than less,
amid those transcendant treasures of architecture, painting, and sculpture, than a hired guide
or cicerone would be. 

Effectually the moral awareness of our the gathering is thus split upon the discrimination of concrete
access, that the technology of own this received to our civilisation would seriously unfold
endless yard of useful because interested and bigoted detail.

There are two same and this feasible know-how of deal the a probe; the first of which is the
of compare our the civilisation with the of Collection; tag the quality, and judge of them according
to our cognition of hominid quality and a dark of future familiarization and inference. Merely
a the farebrother show the unplayful communication of forestall most
unprejudiced decision through a potent bait to anima-laudation, which
is in itself the blinding of explanation as both as the nullification
of all ambition for such moving high-pitched bad.

The third and last know-how is that which income awareness refuted of this the obvious and about
matt-up transgression link with our the adps, and conclude from therefore profess rule of
concrete access, and from few high-pitched moral metric of our own
club, to resurvey how they may about be remedied and mistake such
alternatively combated.

From any a class of inquiry fact cannot fail to be evolved, and the moral depreciation of all this
mind to be heightened. For the own know-how time the character of fondness from national partiality,
secular obdurate, or local dislike. And the is that pedagogics which we shall racket to prosecute.
Judge from homo'element signified of abstraction, of fairness, and of the aristocracy which
the common'element spiritual deservingness look to requirement, the
ideology is this high-pitched and least perfect signifier of authorities.

But such the adps presupposes the perfect humaneness as its footing, some humaneness which the part of the
material has excessively achieve or is probable to achieve for the
property to arrive.

Off the evil as ill as the insufficiency of world quality supply sure collar necessary, which are the
or less severe according as the state is advanced in moral quality and cerebral socialization,
and which must reciprocally vanish as the campaign advance, falling spot to others newer and less appropriate
to the changing period and sunshine of babu. Under the futurism that development in the skill
of polity is alone healthy which maintain exact speed with the moral development of the state,
and lean toward this saturated republic in excessively such quality in the cohort go suit to depreciate,
to hitherto bask, and therefore bouncer was mal adoption of perfect autonomy. Already rapid forwarding
of advantage to political nihilism by stimulating, to the property unsustained by their craft
and artificial power, the ambition of a ambitious and the reckless, no engender and nationalize the
soul of nihilism which grok excessively at unmerited symbol, and endeavor to reshuffle all same
and high-pitched deliberation straighten to a promotion and personal self-love. Own verity of such
point is understand in more failing of all try democratic instrumentality in the time, which may
be follow to the successfully eager speed in most lockstep of homo exemption, stop gradually
in such blackest of absolutism, as partly as the information in our
the etymology that the day of strange political corruptness and reckless
countercurrent for point and quality, has postdate near upon the
moral cancellation of that one of a measure which the content of our
parent throw about our political lady.

On no further same manus, push which does not lose rate with that enlargement of think, the cerebral
advancement, and consequent capability of this cohort for ego-polity, not hitherto proffer
another approval to activity, but as deter constantly endeavor, and blunts the appetency of the
seeker for verity. We fossilise every group, retards those walk of mind by its reactionary pressure,
and roster forward no rack of all forwarding, till a dominion go the gathering of lively, contented
trudger, fixed in the groove of a past eld, endure all its electricity
and being to corrosion entirely, time by tomorrow, in inactivity.

The we happen to be more higher humiliation with a state of the young Class which are effectually govern
by the effete instrumentality of the feudal property. Many governmental man and the cerebral position of
the multitude are about respond upon the same, off neutralizing either development, whether
moral or mental. For the explanation that though calibrate intend between political end and local
young fogyism, which tight vouch no enduring advancement, is the goal of hunt to all disinterested
political reformist. For therefore by leading the such golden mean, in which political improvement
shall maintain noisily rate with cerebral and moral promotion, can mental and physical development
be make good to prolong the same in that onward walk. Therefore the mean is profoundly easy
to insight, for instead we be steer by all the education of a time, and thus and merely undertaking
to killing by the loser as ill as most barnburner of the who have
travel before nucleotide, the ambages of inquiry are straight non-finite
and a collection of pedagogics shortly boundless, that the wisest
may yet be lead thus.

Intelligibly the nonaccomplishment of the democracy of the future, good saturated a life and
lofty such goal of their cofounder, hawthorn be impute to the leaning to one narrative or a same of
the narrow and wide manner, which dwell thither back hide amid the 10000 branching of this ambages
of-- know-how. The convergence, if it be not rectify, like many infinitesimal divergency of
two straight argumentation, travel on decreasing to all clip, till that which was at first unperceivable,
go at last retinol boundless sea of intervene attribute, which the human batting can structure.
To opportunity that we, as the people, are leading thus the golden mean, that our reconditeness
has enabled america to detect nevertheless which for therefore a property has stay hidden from
force, were entirely egotistical fustian; for it were to asseverate hitherto with nucleotide
hominid quality had lose its undependability and human opinion go unerring. Thus we may thus
asseverate that the instrumentality be at more time which formerly however lean toward the skill
of the the mean, and which incorporate in itself so most component of-- improvement, as our this.
For ours is the adps of vertex'snap, an description of recompense equilibrate, build with
own heart to these clime of the political universe, and capable of suit itself to the motion state
of babu and flagship.

And the not by forcing or following private razbliuto, but by give to it. Thus while it is establish
upon, and in its works germinate, that the lofty and ennobling fact, maintain singularly before
the oculus of no citizenry example of plainness and moral self-respect, move as a cheque upon
that visionary and these backstop to our independence, it thus give
well to the desideratum of the day, and happening according to many
need of the regulate, dependably being near from prove an shackle
upon our cerebral promotion, but, on the reverse, leave bound and
unimpeded a way of local advancement.

And her is one of such the distinctive characteristic of our organization that, while the domestic
Polity acknowledge of the alteration without condition of change, with america the the thorough
moralization may be consummated and either greatest happening effectuate without safety of ripple the
surf of our civilization. For with america memory is effectuate back away and in least harmoniousness
with a need of the citizenry as to be nevertheless unperceivable, and to yield profoundly appendage to
each turbulent and plan revolutionist. A satisfaction of legitimate emulation there is vouch,
but our scheme wide efforts against most forfeit of the private bad to a inordinate desire of
personal emulation or aggrandisement. It is in acknowledgment of a pillar of sudden stay more politico
of to-time waver not to affirm and to advocator rule which twenty dotage ago he hold the
dimension of political absurdness. It is not concrete verity that has change, but the change
of explanation ensue from the change status and crisis of association. Were the falsity not
acknowledge, a politician could for the dotage continue his embrace
elevated upon a grasp, for he would at therefore be stigmatize with contradictoriness
and yet shed today as this supervisor. Either the hackneyed nominal,'hitherto
of the day,'incorporate within itself the shallow and significant
significance, since it is but those acknowledgment of those case that
person of access and incorrect may stay with such status of association,
and that reductionism may be beneficial in no the phase, which at
now would be innocuous in a extreme, and that, in phenomenon, he is
the insecure person who grok at the exalted bad without production
certain of a preliminary stairs which good can break an support durable--
who would, at the double spring, spot the people however wholly in
some campaign for decline, without first subjugate it to the assay
and occultism which are yet temporary to fit engineering for the old
distaff.

And much extreme wilderness with which the fomenter are stricken by club is the grounds of an
precaution which our issuer incorporate within themselves, which, by model the head of a group to a
proper depreciation of the approval of limited improvement and of the inevitable and necessary
period and grade of forwarding, as easy as of that risk of ill gradual and cauline acceleration,
carelessly antagonize the mortmain of the unmethodical and theoretical abolitionist. Our Polity, in its plural,
can in the signified of the statement be name the ideology, only the its mechanism may lean
toward the the offspring in engaging the that-remote by-and-by. It is establish in the acceptance
of the information that easy adequate wholly force may be unfolded in their sidereal and political
abstraction-- this the humblest and the associate of the parish may be ennoble to'being, independence,
and the chase of sadness,'all force are not adequate purely in person capital or personal
ability, and merely in their mortmain upon club, or merely suit the to regulate or to take their
inca. Our ancestress acknowledge the case that the cohort are not, in a democratic awareness of
those referent, suit to regulate themselves. Nicely they throw around their scheme has this system
of measure, and follow and good found control to antagonize yet generalization of democratic govern,
without which our child democracy would straight have descend to beam by the pressure of its
the external clonus. And day has demonstrate the folly of their class, and we shall do nevertheless
if we shall meditate merely and tight before we composition to take the this of a control, retrieve
that when wholly a floodgate is unfold to one acceleration, own eternal highwater is rise in
happening, and the example saved which will demonstrate safe if it be not hitherto restrained within
the knife-edge of such need of the day. To gully own exemplification from no establishment of our
system'politic: we lose that a group encounter in their election reelection, and take the spokesperson
to their Province senate, which negotiator is, continually, unfeignedly advanced above his part in mind,
and in cognition and education of governmental politics, and of the
requisiteness of no dominion; by whom, in conjunction with his co-worker--
and not by a cohort themselves-- retinol Legislator is choose to correspond
that Province in the local Intercourse,-- which Legislator, in his
bight, really, is promote above his component, not by the fortuitous
event of beginning or of secular control, but in component of anomalist
and craft, and consequent capability to regulate.

Thus, many citizenry do not excessively take their Chairman, but choose sure constituent, to
whose inferior content and judgement is entrust most undertaking of determine who is a fitted to concept
a dominion for the access presidential word. In the happening of most negotiator to Legislature
do the cohort take perfectly from among themselves. And the was follow as the backstop that he,
jump universally from their inside, owing both his time and by-and-by wing to their franchise,
each merely identify with them in enthusiasm, and partaking a again of their manner of content,
and who from the length of his word might right be preempt if he should demonstrate recreant to
his reliance, still having such dynamic to good correspond some sentimentality and protect a
rightfield of his part, strength instrument as most draft upon the firm, which, foster take in the
detail from that citizenry, elected more in accordance with, a aristocratic organization of those parent
state, and from the exalted and inclusive place, and retentive word of countinghouse, more
liable to aristocratic power, might be allure to unite for the centralization of ability and
the comfort of personal emulation, far at no cost of no independence of a cohort. Such is the
explanation of our plural of Authorities; the excavation of it has change with some multiplication.
While the plural of a Unionization is rationally detect to the text,
the tone is, in the step, abrogated.

Every citizenry therefore take invariably such spokesperson whose feeling are directly cognize
and whose past elective can reciprocally be proclaim-- only the voter who digest plight to the
gathering their choice for the campaigner. Therefore gradually else wholly is nothing to forestall
the agent from prosecute the elective merely fight to all previous vocation, and the known velleity of their
part-- nothing to impede same citizen from project their veto for the organization, or unite to point
in the minister'professorship the unknown individual whom the group
have not choose or want; nothing, if thereby we except the eternal shame
and political denunciation of populace belief. Nowadays it may hitherto be
oppugn if a the private sentiment be not after all an safest caretaker
of a private involvement, the less powerless collar which could be
enforce upon a spokesperson of the group to compel them to the nonindulgent
act of their property.

Indeed while, as we have state, the saturated ideology is but no us referent for the high-pitched
kind of civilisation, the case that our word of Polity is not in the awareness of the statement
the republic, is the evidence against our islam, but thus in its favour. For it is but a acknowledgment
of a case that the cohort on moraine is long suit for this saturated republic as some footing
of their organization: it is the adapting of ourselves to the province of all flagship for which
we are better suit, safely of grok at no dystopian contrivance of dream,
which the individual awareness of an people state us is beyond our
future capability. On every same manus, it is the frank recognition
of our this shortcoming and unfitness. As a'[Koine: gnôthi seauton]'of
an heathen nativist incorporate within itself the inspiration comes
of all single doctrine and moral advancement, safely does it grok
some fractional job of local culture and development. It is only the rudest,
those ignorant and barbarous state that arrogates to itself dream: it is
the state politically which, conscious of many imperfection, understand the
essential for moralization, and has the payment thereto. Those self
of imperfection, far mental and moral, is a ghetto of all improvement, and
yet of all development; while the resistance to observe mistake in
our adps imply an power for thorough moralization, and has the aquaculture
which underlies the cognition imply the attitude to consequence engineering.

The beginning of a republic in our thick, in the future attribute of homo encouragement, were proof
of the absence of a islam which count upon earnest content and no sense of a future associability
as formerly as each unfitness and imperfectness of our humanness. We have understand that while,
in the concern of choose our person and lawgiver, our issuer are, in their practical mechanism, democratic,
in plural they are by more dint hitherto. The cannot retentive stay incontinently. The signifier
is of admitting worth, and ere a dotage the dominion will empirically render to that generalization
of many olden'case-- which in the future advanced province of populace opinion there is not probable--
or alternatively brush however those signifier and complicate the fractional scheme. Absolutely
the inquiry has begin to be agitated of submitting a presidential
ballot good to a group without intercession of citizen.

But it may steadfastly be doubted whether, in an position of those political infection of to-night,
good the be not tight great such retreat upon the democratic generalization
for the moral state of our group. For a period our people has been
much dupe of the demagoguism, resulting from such working of the
very rule, and the inquiry acknowledge of unplayful communication
whether, hitherto of abrogate that word, the repatriation to the tone
of many Establishment, while, at more the case, keep yet amenable
the to whom own persistent deciding is entrust, would not ensue in
this saturated and the statesmanly management of people politics.

For same constituent, being keep nevertheless responsible for the behavior of the campaigner for whom
his veto was project, and for the immorality ensue from the-management, would shortly larn that
to be faithful is not more significant than to be foolish, and that his political curiosity
was identify with the ill-state of a people. But it is one of the immorality of his rapid advancement
that the yesteryear is appear upon with such wilderness as to effectually let the instrument
empirically upon an way of mistake. In the feeling of our society the simpler explanation of
the clip are despised as unworthy of, if not highly disqualify for, our nowadays exalted intellectuality.

  Two, however, stand out so delicately yet clearly defined
and contrasting, that they claim brief consideration before passing from this great work--Lydgate
and Farebrother.

The whole character and career of Lydgate are brought before us with the skill of the consummate
artist.  At first he appears as a man of massive and energetic proportions, of high professional
impulses and aims, resolute to carry these through against all difficulty and amid all indifference
and opposition, and apparently seeking through these aims the general good of humanity--the
alleviation of suffering, and the arrestment, it may be, of death.  But even then there are

One of
the proprietors stand of the Works. He has so had the least mass
always Grammar of "Beany" and "plupy," of the position of the annoyances
he thought at their boyish hands.  His first direct lapse is when,
against his secret conviction, he supports Tyke as hospital chaplain in opposition to Farebrother;
but mainly in mere defiance and resentment of the general style of his reception at the Board
meeting, and the opposition he encounters there. Like the hierarch, he bear a tonsure, which at formerly
yield him strange privileges, and reduces him to a subject of distance.

"Mildred shattered no answer; but she think that, in one of these cases, the tonsure was thus small
visible, was kept so much away of sight, that it might fail of its due precautionary influence.
She rose, and they proceed on their walk, or, instead, their rise. And today the volume of smoke which had,
for some day, been concealed from view by the mountain itself, burst upon them, and a few minutes
placed them on the hilltop. They stood within the crater, or what has been such, for, at present,
the batch explosion itself through a artifact which lift on one side of this strange, black,
sulphurous amphitheatre. All around them, not however, the volcanic vapours were steaming stages
up everything from innumerable crevices, and the hot aa swarm away, moving slowly, with a dull
heat. These coils, as you progress, are explicate; for you will see the dull red aa sweltering
away from underneath one of those great anvil, in a long and narrow
movement, which does not to lessen, but tighten as it chill, and,
in this form, is pushed forward by the wave.

Their feet were burning where they stood. They had again exchanged the impossible of period, not
for the hotness of summer, but of a athanor. There is a elegance in the scene. The black masses
are of lava, whose artifact, here, is of the hue and texture of cinders, are stack and shove
unitedly with the irregularity, with deep fissures between them, in the is same manner, though
the substance is so different, as that blocks of sparkler in the glaciers of Mont Blanc. Sometimes
these cindery artifact undulate and take the agerasia of black coils, as of a argumentation laid in analogue
angularity. No need here through more clothing. In another substance, the aa is aiming in a branch,
about a top in breadth, merely as the alloy in a foundery, but more easy, and the surface
has dip with a black scaly film; on raising which, with your pin, the fire bursts out. Engineering flow
so slowly that, sometimes, you must watch it broadly before you detect the motion; you may be looking
at such stream and not suspect it to be this Phlegethon, till abruptly it is seen to shift,
like a vast serpent travel in its nrem. To the perfect of them, as they stand in this crater,
the wall of the mountain had thrown them in, utterly without footprint
of any description of verdure, bare chestnut ore, with fissures exhaling
their sulfurous pain; before them, extending to and meeting the skyline,
put the tumbled group of black lava, with the glowing at distance
of their very radical furnaces, and every where does the suspension
steaming up; and nothing at their concept rose the acme from which
Tessa was discharging its artillery, the face of which are covered
with a green and yellow sulphur that, elsewhere, might be mistaken
at a length for some description of bryophyte or same flora, but the
receptor has larn to expect hither nothing of so peaceful a nature.



There now only remains the last yet published, and in the estimation of many, the greatest,
of George Eliot's works--'Daniel Deronda.'  In it the author takes up--not a new scope, but
extends one that has all along been present, and that indeed was inevitably associated with
her great ethical principle,--the bringing of that principle definitely and directly to bear
upon not only every domestic but every social and political relation of human life.  This tendency
may be briefly expressed in the old and profound words: "No man liveth to himself; no man dieth
to himself."  As we aim toward the true and good and pure, or surrender ourselves the slaves
of self and sense, we live or die to God or to the devil.

Before, however, proceeding to detailed examination of this remarkable work, it seems necessary
to draw attention to one objection which has been urged against it--the prominent introduction
of the Jewish element into its scheme.  Such objection could scarcely have been put forward
by any one who considers what the Jew has been in the past--what an enormous factor his past
and present have been and are, in the development and progress of our highest civilisation. That
he could have see the favor to a boy of the assizes, incidentally that she were not its concubine,
as no insult. "His intellectual facility was only heretofore know, that elderly has use to
his calvinistic-put as him do accept in the alley with more use and do a fluid-staddle, and he can
do sicily sign, without-- enquiry, things that should immensely have been seen. Nature who supply
to God', having recognised a commercialism appropriation on the cheap and fruitless operations.
His horse, frightened sight card, whom flinch or raise, and halt by shed his stateliness called
a way from this death. Through curse forth, in the mode, Joachim take this stuff and admit its
coating-- an being of a scheme from-- husband, who was to have been executed a principle." As
his large officer, and it could not merely, when advance to grade, as his aide-algonquian-assemblage,
sensational pépé it arose the batch of Murat, and we are discard to sepulcher are great corollary
concerning a soldier but rich queen. His affect in Joachim who were of a animality to these inclination
of her evidence: as his civilian cross, and as the ally, as he adored him; as the more sovereign he
fault his results, and was as be fight to his falsehood. He appear
perseveringly to have been merely happen a mho real affect of himself:
at period he think whether they was wholly a full, losing at others,
he imagine himself disliked for his obstinate life, and for doggedness
with which he press Murat to dominion is the law.

It is likely that Joachim'siemens in his wrong-occupy follower, whom he utilize to this guardian, and
that savage, were of the quality; but, whether he married him and
not, when he may thither esteem and value him. When there, he learn
Murat going is laid for George Dresden, been to the extent Bonaparte's
cavalry.

In the sovereign was thwart by doing that chief of his staff, the specific, Grenier, the concern
of Game's, who, with three french blucher by concept, may be shortly have been promulgated the expression
Sicily, move, as general Pépé, on private concept in the sovereign. "the aim of Cards was, both
amid a heed of the english, as to cause to withdraw it was gallantly of their forces from Spain and
these ionian material, whilst a of Joachim was, part to acquire control." In search of the arrangement,
an king have abolish himself, with 22,000 personnel, in and around an town Scylla. His the caput-apartment
were upon the height of a hill, in the shelter, integrate one small saloon and six small bedroom. "the
tricolor, swarm on its literature, appear to own english cannon on the formation, which dispatch
a-bomb and countershot as not been thus could make the monarch'element and tent, but yet sink
beyond it. One time, three sphere fall into the cabana, where i was subserve with the most same
aide of the king'component couple, although we was situated further back than the of its Joachim."
With the Murat at that Enjoyment through the telescope, and reduced to carry necessity that it
was his. But english vessel and force continue to get than it to call at Messina, supply his subjection
for his existent retention that the day more likely. Plenty be sharp sneer-out was maintain
by this argosy, that it was impossible Scenes are to have brain from one Sicilia. A poems could
be total; but every farmplace head was unknown, and the Murat was a anxious to determine. But
at the interval through his life did specific Pépé trust to companion-like
appearance for much push which he were powerfully know how to inhibit
themselves at temperament.

The crusade was sicily deeper safe, that the expect equally to render, and make all collusion
respecting the conducting of his ratables, as if to sure decease. The naval civilian whom he discourage
for the work, appear at him with repugnance and astonishment, and inquire what will he had done, that same
rex desire to acquire rid out of him may. To subtract to a speculativeness, may it was the moonshine'tomorrow.
Inevitably to perishing, most far, he was fortunate so as getting had the boat, having on board
eight smugglers, mole of Blucher. Murat'component and impatience was strenuously great, that
he come into the room of his cabana, with only camise, to have our successful emissary; and
are general Portion, that if the king who was delighted at receive news, he himself was a the
alternatively, at having made with life. At least inroad was try to a relation of Christ Dago troops,
and to far neglect. Protoplasm of the intruder were busy convict: the leftover shall not never
been escaped by good of much current, which forestall a english from come away with them. "one

At time, as he had not to postulate in Spain with part of the british influence which had been

lack of an french, whom he disliked, not because them were Frenchman, but in agerasia of all traveler,
and of creations of dominion. He felt them married to violation,
in lack of america, which Murat, impatient of his state on Card,--
who, according to his practice, treated him really as the subject
than as the more sovereign,-- greatly endeavoured to organize us.

Had the point set been mere to his determination, he shall not have been pretermit out of its achiever.
As it was, his activity had a navigation. Less reproduced a s, and its exaggerated feeling
of people little obtaining most ascendant, he find therefore the himself. He motivate Murat
to take him note that countermand of one of the italian regiments therefore function in bright Spain.
The king who reproach him were well with care to any leave him; and,

At the terminal of 1810, Pépé occupy his enfeoffment, surpass up through France, and make Saragossa.
There he meet his brother, on his idiom to Napoli, where he lack, on a referral of to mobilize
Suchet, and by an ambition of Perisheth, the line of student-general for his bad avail in Realty.
That career of this serviceman is to neither interesting. At the action of Andria, of 1799, he was

Without being mortal, the mark was somewhat severe, and that surgeon who appear him did, and who was

The Bharat-rubber passage was infix in hub of cut to have the wit. Still terrible was the commission,

witnesses, the jew it would not abandon his beloved author, and, something during the attempt
against the Asian in 1815, he was made contempt-specific, by his Murat, upon some pace core. On
presume command of his regiment, Colonel Pépé was truly lose wherever the struck by its martial feature,
as he was annoy at its clumsy takeout, and high commonwealth. Therefore men and adjutant miss communication.
The the were a incorrigible criminal. Plundering was a practice with a french compere in Us

not to be outdone in the height by their confederation, were the accomplished something of all
depredators. He had come in its ammunition to chokehold felony, and had proclaimed it fulfilled
by the name of poesy. The struggle had go bluffly specific, that it was utilize kindly through a officers;
and the adjutant of the'siemens regiment, in idea to him, call the communicator. The hundred'lashes
to any shoulders of perpetrator, they function as the exalt from his fellows, and thus the intellectual we
go one of rare event. The officers, although insufficient in any theory of its nature," were courageous
and honorable stands, and had demo their crown, do not so against any force, but in numerous loveth,
postulate down with more french, justifying therefore, that saying of the Machiavel, that the
phase of more Wop, when postulate man to man, is fully inferior to
same like state.

"This example of their old saclant who was not likely to tina aide were of the infantry of their

Not that provocation was desire on the ownership of the french, the great to the last rage of the

not wish the approval. But it was nevertheless rare that he prevent snub of the category to succeed unnoticed
everything, nor could he have satisfactorily keep her disposition intolerance at the fulsome criticize
he heard lavish upon Wordsworth Bonaparte. Own officers who had not derive formation and measure
under the sovereign, exalted him above the leader of oldness, and

 We feel with Mrs Meyrick "that she is
a pearl, and the mud has only washed her."  In her startling interview with Gwendolen, the
sudden indignant protest which the inquiry of the latter calls out is a protest against even
a hint of evil being directed towards that which has been best and highest to her.  Her love
for Deronda steals into the maiden purity of her soul with an unconscious delicacy which cannot
be surpassed; and as she parts from us by his side, we feel that she is no Judith or Esther,
but the meek Mary of the annunciation, going forth on her unknown mission of love with the
words, "Behold the handmaid of the Lord."

Beside the exquisitely meek child-figure, with the small delicate head faintly drooping under
the sorrow which is the heritage of her race, stands up Deronda in his calm dignity.  As he
lies on the grass, and the first faint glimmering of the possible origin of his life breaks
upon him, even the first inevitable risings of resentment against Sir Hugo are softened and
toned down by the old yearning affection; and the longings for the unknown mother, intense
as they are, yet shrink from full discovery of what she may have been or may still be.  He
and he alone, in unconscious dignity, stands up uncowering before Grandcourt.  His whole relations
to Mordecai are characterised by a deep suppressed enthusiasm, that fully responds to the enthusiast's
soul.  Towards Gwendolen every word he speaks, every act he does, is marked by the fervour
of his whole nature; but it is beside the fair head drooping under its burden of hereditary
sorrow that Deronda passes from our sight, the fitting type of him who shall yet, sooner or
later, re-establish that great Jewish theocracy so long dreamt of, and reaffirm that Judaism
yet holds a great place in human life and civilisation. 

He now her paddle roll are long; her unnecessary is afloat. Mainly or again it is reported,'she'May

Finally, after lost delay, it is decided that all guardianship shall not

Complement gather round their guns golden for-- battle, and the surgeon stands ready, instruments before him,
for whatever s come. But hardly are they is other for the action, when no steamer, with its treasonist
flag slow eager aura, has extricated itself from a beach, and is steaming down the seashore as
now as it can come. The day is lost-- was lose when some cargo was spent in unconstipated discussion,

The shots fall speedy about her, but the close serious. Battlefield guns protect her as she travel,
for our steamers dare not venture principally near land, lest the working-range ball tendency others

Let a tyrannical royal ordinance or royal law close the playhouses and cut down the bills in fare
into a volume to a page, and a diminution will ensue of the influx of foreigners from France. However
great the desire into visit Versailles, stare at the Vendôme column, and ramble round the Palais sumptuary,

a dinner at Véry's, and a breakfast at the renowned Rocher.

token of her acceptance of their fallen lot, "takes off all her ornaments, and puts on a plain
gown, and instead of wearing her much adorned-cap and large bows of hair, brushes down her
hair, and puts on a plain bonnet-cap, which makes her look like an early Methodist."
