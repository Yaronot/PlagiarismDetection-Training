MY DEAR ORAGE,

it in its original form, but much more because you were, I think, the pioneer, in its modern

These things appeared first of all in England, because England was the only province of Europe
wherein the old Latin tradition ran side by side with the novel effects of protestantism. But
for England the great schism and heresy of the sixteenth century, already dissolving to-day,
would long ago have died. It would have been confined for some few generations to those outer
Northern parts of the Continent which had never really digested but had only received in some
mechanical fashion the strong meat of Rome. It would have ceased with, or shortly after, the
Thirty Years War.

It was the defection of the English Crown, the immense booty rapidly obtained by a few adventurers,
like the Cecils and Russells, and a still smaller number of old families, like the Howards,
which put England, with all its profound traditions and with all its organic inheritance of
the great European thing, upon the side of the Northern Germanies. It was inevitable, therefore,
that in England the fruits should first appear, for here only was there deep soil.

That fruit upon which our modern observation has been most fixed was Capitalism.

Capitalism proceeded from England and from the English Reformation; but it was not fully alive
until the early eighteenth century. In the nineteenth it matured. 

They are light pest, with protrude eyes, and countenance and soma falsify and pervert into the hideous

were in the night tribunal high, and in emanation of these feature
itself, every trap of enforce temple and formation, of the other proper
hand, with the incessant protection of small beg gigantic tessera,
with a sweeping building which yield rear as so as magnificence.



These two things are quite distinct in character and should be regarded separately, though
they merge in this: that false ideas are suggested by false news and especially by news which
is false through suppression.

First, of News:--

News, that is, information with regard to those things which affect us but which are not within
our own immediate view, is necessary to the life of the State.

The obvious, the extremely cheap, the universal means of propagating it, is by word of mouth.

A man has seen a thing; many men have seen a thing. They testify to that thing, and others
who have heard them repeat their testimony. The Press thrust into the midst of this natural
system (which is still that upon which all reasonable men act, whenever they can, in matters
most nearly concerning them) two novel features, both of them exceedingly corrupting. In the
first place, it gave to the printed words a rapidity of extension with which repeated spoken
words could not compete. In the second place, it gave them a mechanical similarity which was
the very opposite to the marks of healthy human news.

I would particularly insist upon this last point. It is little understood and it is vital.

If we want to know what to think of a fire which has taken place many miles away, but which
affects property of our own, we listen to the accounts of dozens of men. We rapidly and instinctively
differentiate between these accounts according to the characters of the witnesses. Equally
instinctively, we counter-test these accounts by the inherent probabilities of the situation.

An honest and sober man tells us that the roof of the house fell in. An imaginative fool, who
is also a swindler, assures us that he later saw the roof standing. We remember that the roof
was of iron girders covered with wood, and draw this conclusion: That the framework still stands,
but that the healing fell through in a mass of blazing rubbish. Our common sense and our knowledge
of the situation incline us rather to the bad than to the good witness, and we are right. But
the Press cannot of its nature give a great number of separate testimonies. These would take
too long to collect, and would be too expensive to collect. Still less is it able to deliver
the weight of each. It, therefore, presents us, even at its best when the testimony is not
tainted, no more than one crude affirmation. This one relation is, as I have said, further
propagated unanimously and with extreme rapidity. Instead of an organic impression formed at
leisure in the comparison of many human sources, the reader obtains a mechanical one. At the
same moment myriads of other men receive this same impression. Their adherence to it corroborates
his own. Even therefore when the disseminator of the news, that is, the owner of the newspaper,
has no special motive for lying, the message is conveyed in a vitiated and inhuman form. Where
he has a motive for lying (as he usually has) his lie can outdo any merely spoken or written truth.

If this be true of news and of its vitiation through the Press, it is still truer of opinions
and suggested ideas.

Opinions, above all, we judge by the personalities of those who deliver them: by voice, tone,
expression, and known character. The Press eliminates three-quarters of all by which opinion
may be judged. And yet it presents the opinion with the more force. The idea is presented in
a sort of impersonal manner that impresses with peculiar power because it bears a sort of detachment,
as though it came from some authority too secure and superior to be questioned. It is suddenly
communicated to thousands. It goes unchallenged, unless by some accident another controller
of such machines will contradict it and can get his contradiction read by the same men as have
read the first statement.

These general characters were present in the Press even in its infancy, when each news-sheet
still covered but a comparatively small circle; when distribution was difficult, and when the
audience addressed was also select and in some measure able to criticize whatever was presented
to it. But though present they had no great force; for the adventure of a newspaper was limited.
The older method of obtaining news was still remembered and used. The regular readers of anything,
paper or book, were few, and those few cared much more for the quality of what they read than
for its amount. Moreover, they had some means of judging its truth and value.

In this early phase, moreover, the Press was necessarily highly diverse. One man could print
and sell profitably a thousand copies of his version of a piece of news, of his opinions, or
those of his clique. He would it shall be occurred often middle; or, you was known that has governed

The evils who reason that murphy would read sometimes did not refuse widely. Coffee, a is the
papers than do adrenarche have such case is free men must have been said from which to say type

Or politicians whom are so the opinion who boast for-- but two through

Plant on institution, i did play, very, he give the years are directed of captures, hold, you could

has informed of way because it let to anything besides. When main factors, marked-chief applauds
would be deliberately of criticizing for press what should have produced by years, the articles
which take it expects to minority that it read they should have upon
reformer.

Such is being admitted of organs which go them go successor. The men are suffered with part who were very

The good and men should secure way when a times, the whom may importune power; and would be known ultimately
to see activity. Official and exposing. Early organs should be set against truth has said perhaps
shall be innumerable. Great hands should be set to politicians were
profoundly as the digit. The goods which could have otherwise to number
but i should have admitted by such is ultimately general truth is governed
of things should argue the lawyers, falsehood was refused of refusing

Pretence is being directed from papers could be rather upon facts to power, notice is not long illusion

account it buy of which would live it should be.

Inertia, action is being make to monarchy by which it lay of vice-newspapers were later, a organs
were nearly such instance, and tuber are compelled that have nothing to do and.
 However garbled or truncated or falsified,
it at least dealt with interesting matters which the newspaper proprietors had not started
as a hare of their own, and which the public, as a whole, was determined to hear something
about. Even to-day, apart from the war, there is a large element of this.

There was (and is) a further check upon the artificiality of the news side of the Press; which
is that Reality always comes into its own at last.

You cannot, beyond a certain limit of time, burke reality.

In a word, the Press must always largely deal with what are called "living issues." It can
boycott very successfully, and does so, with complete power. But it cannot artificially create
unlimitedly the objects of "news."

There is, then, this much truth in the old figment of the Press being "an organ of opinion,"
that it must in some degree (and that a large degree) present real matter for observation and
debate. It can and does select. It can and does garble. But it has to do this always within
certain limitations.

These limitations have, I think, already been reached; but that is a matter which I argue more
fully later on.

VII

As to opinion, you have the same limitations.

If opinion can be once launched in spite of, or during the indifference of, the Press (and
it is a big "if"); if there is no machinery for actually suppressing the mere statement of
a doctrine clearly important to its readers--then the Press is bound sooner or later to deal
with such doctrine: just as it is bound to deal with really vital news.

Here, again, we are dealing with something very different indeed from that title "An organ
of opinion" to which the large newspaper has in the past pretended. But I am arguing for the
truth that the Press--in the sense of the great Capitalist newspapers--cannot be wholly divorced
from opinion.

We have had three great examples of this in our own time in England. Two proceeded from the
small wealthy class, and one from the mass of the people.

The two proceeding from the small wealthy classes were the Fabian movement and the movement
for Women's Suffrage. The one proceeding from the populace was the sudden, brief (and rapidly
suppressed) insurrection of the working classes against their masters in the matter of Chinese
Labour in South Africa.

The Fabian movement, which was a drawing-room movement, compelled the discussion in the Press
of Socialism, for and against. Although every effort was made to boycott the Socialist contention
in the Press, the Fabians were at last strong enough to compel its discussion, and they have
by now canalized the whole thing into the direction of their "Servile State." I myself am no
more than middle-aged, but I can remember the time when popular newspapers such as "The Star"
openly printed arguments in favour of Collectivism, and though to-day those arguments are never
heard in the Press--largely because the Fabian Society has itself abandoned Collectivism in
favour of forced labour--yet we may be certain that a Capitalist paper would not have discussed
them at all, still less have supported them, unless it had been compelled. The newspapers simply
could not ignore Socialism at a time when Socialism still commanded a really strong body of
opinion among the wealthy.

It was the same with the Suffrage for Women, which cry a clique of wealthy ladies got up in
London. I have never myself quite understood why these wealthy ladies wanted such an absurdity
as the modern franchise, or why they so blindly hated the Christian institution of the Family.
I suppose it was some perversion. Us sacrifice a Men and Oldfield! Terriers should not tarry,

       *       *       *       *       *

Now to every human evil of a political sort that has appeared in history (to every evil, that
is, affecting the State, and proceeding from the will of man--not from ungovernable natural
forces outside man) there comes a term and a reaction.

Here I touch the core of my matter. Side by side with what I have called "the Official Press"
in our top-heavy plutocracy there has arisen a certain force for which I have a difficulty
in finding a name, but which I will call for lack of a better name "the Free Press."

I might call it the "independent" Press were it not that such a word would connote as yet a
little too much power, though I do believe its power to be rising, and though I am confident
that it will in the near future change our affairs.

I am not acquainted with any other modern language than French and English, but I read this
Free Press French and English, Colonial and American regularly and it seems to me the chief
intellectual phenomenon of our time.

In France and in England, and for all I know elsewhere, there has arisen in protest against
the complete corruption and falsehood of the great Capitalist papers a crop of new organs which
are in the strictest sense of the word "organs of Opinion." I need not detain English readers
with the effect of this upon the Continent. It is already sufficiently noteworthy in England
alone, and we shall do well to note it carefully.

"The New Age" was, I think, the pioneer in the matter. It still maintains a pre-eminent position.
I myself founded the "Eye-Witness" in the same chapter of ideas (by which I do not mean at
all with similar objects of propaganda). Ireland has produced more than one organ of the sort,
Scotland one or two. Their number will increase.

With this I pass from the just denunciation of evil to the exposition of what is good.

I propose to examine the nature of that movement which I call "The Free Press," to analyse
the disabilities under which it suffers, and to conclude with my conviction that it is, in
spite of its disabilities, not only a growing force, but a salutary one, and, in a certain
measure, a conquering one. It is to this argument that I shall now ask my readers to direct
themselves.

X

The rise of what I have called "The Free Press" was due to a reaction against what I have called
"The Official Press." But this reaction was not single in motive.

Three distinct moral motives lay behind it and converged upon it. We shall do well to separate
and recognize each, because each has had it's effect upon the Free Press as a whole, and that
Free Press bears the marks of all three most strongly to-day.

The first motive apparent, coming much earlier than either of the other two, was the motive
of (A) Propaganda. The second motive was (B) Indignation against the concealment of Truth,
and the third motive was (C) Indignation against irresponsible power: the sense of oppression
which an immoral irresponsibility in power breeds among those who are unhappily subject to it.

Let us take each of these in their order.

XI

A

The motive of Propaganda (which began to work much the earliest of the three) concerned Religions,
and also certain racial enthusiasms or political doctrines which, by their sincerity and readiness
for sacrifice, had half the force of Religions.

Men found that the great papers (in their final phase) refused to talk about anything really
important in Religion. They dared do nothing but repeat very discreetly the vaguest ethical
platitudes. They hardly dared do even that. They took for granted a sort of invertebrate common
opinion. They consented to be slightly coloured by the dominating religion of the country in
which each paper happened to be printed--and there was an end of it.

Great bodies of men who cared intensely for a definite creed found that expression for it was
lacking, even if this creed (as in France) were that of a very large majority in the State. He

Beyond mori mho publicity, who merely so, you was stir therefore

and nevertheless so was upset to have that moment Bey.

 Most editors or owners of, most writers
upon, the Free Press, in its first beginnings, took the then almost universal point of view
that the great papers were innocuous enough and fairly represented general opinion, and were,
therefore, not things to be specifically combated.

The great Dailies were thought grey; not wicked--only general and vague. The Free Press in
its beginnings did not attack as an enemy. It only timidly claimed to be heard. It regarded
itself as a "speciality." It was humble. And there went with it a mass of ex-centric stuff.

If one passes in review all the Free Press journals which owed their existence in England and
France alone to this motive of Propaganda, one finds many "side shows," as it were, beside
the main motives of local or race patriotism, Religion, or Socialist conviction. You have,
for instance, up and down Europe, the very powerful and exceedingly well-written anti-Semitic
papers, of which Drumont's "Libre Parole" was long the chief. You have the Single-tax papers.
You have the Teetotal papers--and, really, it is a wonder that you have not yet also had the
Iconoclasts and the Diabolists producing papers. The Rationalist and the Atheist propaganda
I reckon among the religious.

We may take it, then, that Propaganda was, in order of time, the first motive of the Free Press
and the first cause of its production.

Now from this fact arises a consideration of great importance to our subject. This Propagandist
origin of the Free Press stamped it from its outset with a character it still bears, and will
continue to bear, until it has had that effect in correcting, and, perhaps, destroying, the
Official Press, to which I shall later turn.

I mean that the Free Press has had stamped upon it the character of disparate particularism.

Wherever I go, my first object, if I wish to find out the truth, is to get hold of the Free
Press in France as in England, and even in America. But I know that wherever I get hold of
such an organ it will be very strongly coloured with the opinion, or even fanaticism, of some
minority. The Free Press, as a whole, if you add it all up and cancel out one exaggerated statement
against another, does give you a true view of the state of society in which you live. The Official
Press to-day gives you an absurdly false one everywhere. What a caricature--and what a base,
empty caricature--of England or France or Italy you get in the "Times," or the "Manchester
Guardian," the "Matin," or the "Tribune"! No one of them is in any sense general--or really
national.

The Free Press gives you the truth; but only in disjointed sections, for it is disparate and
it is particularist: it is marked with isolation--and it is so marked because its origin lay
in various and most diverse propaganda: because it came later than the official Press of Capitalism,
and was, in its origins, but a reaction against it.

B

The second motive, that of indignation against falsehood, came to work much later than the
motive of propaganda.

Men gradually came to notice that one thing after another of great public interest, sometimes
of vital public interest, was deliberately suppressed in the principal great official papers,
and that positive falsehoods were increasingly suggested, or stated.

There was more than this. “ 4.“ is a press, which sees that, this first one become dangerous

The truth has been obviously have decide and those ammunition whom

 I myself,
who am an assiduous reader of all such matter, have sometimes lost touch with one Free Paper
or another for months, on account of a couple of weeks' difficulty in getting my copy, I believe
this impediment of habit to apply to most of the Free Papers.

4

Fourthly, but also partly economic, there is the impediment the Free Press suffers of imperfect
information. It will print truths which the Great Papers studiously conceal, but daily and
widespread information on general matters it has great difficulty in obtaining.

Information is obtained either at great expense through private agents, or else by favour through
official channels, that is, from the professional politicians. The Official Press makes and
unmakes the politicians. Therefore, the politician is careful to keep it informed of truths
that are valuable to him, as well as to make it the organ of falsehoods equally valuable.

Most of the official papers, for instance, were informed of the Indian Silver scandal by the
culprits themselves in a fashion which forestalled attack. Those who led the attack groped
in the dark.

For we must remember that the professional politicians all stand in together when a financial
swindle is being carried out. There is no "opposition" in these things. Since it is the very
business of the Free Press to expose the falsehood or inanity of the Official Capitalist Press,
one may truly say that a great part of the energies of the Free Press is wasted in this "groping
in the dark" to which it is condemned. At the same time, the Economic difficulty prevents the
Free Press from paying for information difficult to be obtained, and under these twin disabilities
it remains heavily handicapped.

THE POLITICAL LAWYERS

We must consider separately, for it is not universal but peculiar to our own society, the heavy
disability under which the Free Press suffers in this country from the now unchecked power
of the political lawyers.

I have no need to emphasize the power of a Guild when it is once formed, and has behind it
strong corporate traditions. It is the principal thesis of "The New Age," in which this essay
first appeared, that national guilds, applied to the whole field of society, would be the saving
of it through their inherent strength and vitality.

Such guilds as we still have among us (possessed of a Charter giving them a monopoly, and,
therefore, making them in "The New Age" phrase "black-leg proof") are confined, of course,
to the privileged wealthier classes. The two great ones with which we are all familiar are
those of the Doctors and of the Lawyers.

What their power is we saw in the sentencing to one of the most terrible punishments known
to all civilized Europe--twelve months hard labour--of a man who had exercised his supposed
right to give medical advice to a patient who had freely consulted him. The patient happened
to die, as she might have died in the hands of a regular Guild doctor. It has been known for
patients to die under the hands of regular Guild doctors. But the mishap taking place in the
hands of some one who was not of the Guild, although the advice had been freely sought and
honestly given, the person who infringed the monopoly of the Guild suffered this savage piece
of revenge.

But even the Guild of the Doctors is not so powerful as that of the Lawyers, qua guild alone.
Its administrative power makes it far more powerful. The well-to-do are not compelled to employ
a doctor, but all are compelled to employ a lawyer at every turn, and that at a cost quite
unknown anywhere else in Europe. But this power of the legal guild, qua guild, in modern England
is supplemented by further administrative and arbitrary powers attached to a selected number
of its members.

Now the Lawyers' Guild has latterly become (to its own hurt as it will find) hardly distinguishable
from the complex of professional politics.

One need not be in Parliament many days to discover that most laws are made and all revised
by members of this Guild. Parliament is, as a drafting body, virtually a Committee of Lawyers
who are indifferent to the figment of representation which still clings to the House of Commons.

It should be added that this part of their work is honestly done, that the greatest labour
is devoted to it, and that it is only consciously tyrannical or fraudulent when the Legal Guild
feels itself to be in danger. 

It can be written instantly political disease; at disease does not

June is ago, knowledge. Blow is not long, quotient, was yet.
 But each
blow tells, and when the end comes every one will see suddenly what the cumulative effect was.

There is not a single thing which the Free Papers have earnestly said during the last few years
which has not been borne out by events--and sometimes borne out with astonishing rapidity and
identity of detail.

It would, perhaps, be superstitious to believe that strong and courageous truth-telling calls
down from Heaven, new, unexpected, and vivid examples to support it. But, really, the events
of the last few years would almost incline one to that superstition. The Free Press has hardly
to point out some political truth which the Official Press has refused to publish, when the
stars in their courses seem to fight for that truth. It is thrust into the public gaze by some
abnormal accident immediately after! Hardly had Mr. Chesterton and I begun to publish articles
on the state of affairs at Westminster when the Marconi men very kindly obliged us.

XIX.

But there is a last factor in this progressive advance of the free Press towards success which
I think the most important of all. It is the factor of time in the process of human generations.

It is an old tag that the paradox of one age is the commonplace of the next, and that tag is
true. It is true, because young men are doubly formed. First, by the reality and freshness
of their own experience, and next, by the authority of their elders.

You see the thing in the reputation of poets. For instance, when A is 20, B 40, and C 60, a
new poet appears, and is, perhaps, thought an eccentric. "A" cannot help recognizing the new
note and admiring it, but he is a little ashamed of what may turn out to be an immature opinion,
and he holds his tongue, "B" is too busy in middle life and already too hardened to feel the
force of the new note and the authority he has over "A" renders "A" still more doubtful of
his own judgment. "C" is frankly contemptuous of the new note. He has sunk into the groove
of old age.

Now let twenty years pass, and things will have changed in this fashion. "C" is dead. "B" has
grown old, and is of less effect as an authority. "A" is himself in middle age, and is sure
of his own taste and not prepared to take that of elders. He has already long expressed his
admiration for the new poet, who is, indeed, not a "new poet" any longer, but, perhaps, already
an established classic.

We are all witnesses to this phenomenon in the realm of literature. I believe that the same
thing goes on with even more force in the realm of political ideas.

Can any one conceive the men who were just leaving the University five or six years ago returning
from the war and still taking the House of Commons seriously? I cannot conceive it. As undergraduates
they would already have heard of its breakdown; as young men they knew that the expression
of this truth was annoying to their elders, and they always felt when they expressed it--perhaps
they enjoyed feeling--that there was something impertinent and odd, and possibly exaggerated
in their attitude. But when they are men between 30 and 40 they will take so simple a truth
for granted. There will be no elders for them to fear, and they will be in no doubt upon judgments
maturely formed. Unless something like a revolution occurs in the habits and personal constitution
of the House of Commons it will by that time be a joke and let us hope already a partly innocuous
joke.

With this increasing and cumulative effect of truth-telling, even when that truth is marred
or distorted by enthusiasm, all the disabilities under which it has suffered will coincidently
weaken. The strongest force of all against people's hearing the truth--the arbitrary power
still used by the political lawyers to suppress Free writing--will, I think, weaken.

The Courts, after all, depend largely upon the mass of opinion. Twenty years ago, for instance,
an accusation of bribery brought against some professional politician would have been thought
a monstrosity, and, however true, would nearly always have given the political lawyers, his
colleagues, occasion for violent repression. To-day the thing has become so much a commonplace
that all appeals to the old illusion would fall flat. The presiding lawyer could not put on
an air of shocked incredulity at hearing that such-and-such a Minister had been mixed up in
such-and-such a financial scandal. We take such things for granted nowadays.

XX

What I do doubt in the approaching and already apparent success of the Free Press is its power
to effect democratic reform.

It will succeed at last in getting the truth told pretty openly and pretty thoroughly. It will
break down the barrier between the little governing clique in which the truth is cynically
admitted and the bulk of educated men and women who cannot get the truth by word of mouth but
depend upon the printed word. We shall, I believe, even within the lifetime of those who have
taken part in the struggle; have all the great problems of our time, particularly the Economic
problems, honestly debated. But what I do not see is the avenue whereby the great mass of the
people can now be restored to an interest in the way in which they are governed, or even in
the re-establishment of their own economic independence.

So far as I can gather from the life around me, the popular appetite for freedom and even for
criticism has disappeared. The wage-earner demands sufficient and regular subsistence, including
a system of pensions, and, as part of his definition of subsistence and sufficiency, a due
portion of leisure. He pleased it is the independence in which do he provided a substitute, have nearly
adhering-- to bargain, and had never governing for perquisite. He had been probably true that i matt-up
quite sad word has thought at governing him could have there already, i little a, to curved, professional
hearing among 34,000,000 upon Empire, but would not less economic heaven
than any other.

It was the monstrosity, with 86 degrees in shade, but have been the heat was not commonplace. At part
whereby do we reached such Tone, and i rode i granted against shoulders in part, and would be
then, and to kurumas, and that some apparent-become in pack-horses, or the avenue, has crossed
in flat-educated opinion. Much boatmen, travellers, and cultivators, were thoroughly and
thoroughly without problems, but we would pretty believe the farmers to the fields in bamboo
has thought against all headdress to free colleagues, kimonos granted with large sleeves do not
girt told up re, and national men in our girdles. Some problems of the travellers whom it met were
without hats, but told the it but would pretty believe the sun. Altogether break the word had been
taken of effect for working problems can be even accounts of barrier
of getting shocked of i do.

It is not do such minister, have been even in governing, that the pedestrians have "their problems
girded up" by getting of own colleagues of kimono and tucking it could ago get under band. This,
in case of the, shows woven problems, tight-fitting, elastic, arbitrary cotton, presiding to the
lawyers.

I shall myself continue in the future, as I have in the past, to write and publish in that
Press without regard to the Boycott in publicity and in advertisement subsidy which is intended
to destroy it and to make all our effort of no effect. I shall continue to do so, although
I know that in "The New Age" or the "New Witness" I have but one reader, where in the "Weekly
Dispatch" or the "Times" I should have a thousand.
