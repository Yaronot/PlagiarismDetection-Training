But the king's hesitation, perhaps, only accelerated the breach, which their characters made

  Such a force could not be secretly raised
without its coming to the knowledge of the imperial court, where it would naturally excite
suspicion, and thus frustrate his design in the very outset.  From the army, too, the rebellious
purposes for which it was destined, must be concealed till the very moment of execution, since
it could scarcely be expected that they would at once be prepared to listen to the voice of
a traitor, and serve against their legitimate sovereign.  Wallenstein, therefore, must raise
it publicly and in name of the Emperor, and be placed at its head, with unlimited authority,
by the Emperor himself. But how could this be accomplished, otherwise than by his being appointed
to the command of the army, and entrusted with full powers to conduct the war.  Yet neither
his pride, nor his interest, permitted him to sue in person for this post, and as a suppliant
to accept from the favour of the Emperor a limited power, when an unlimited authority might
be extorted from his fears.  In order to make himself the master of the terms on which he would
resume the command of the army, his course was to wait until the post should be forced upon
him.  This was the advice he received from Arnheim, and this the end for which he laboured
with profound policy and restless activity.

Informed of all that was transacted in the Emperor's cabinet to his advantage, Wallenstein
possessed sufficient self-command to conceal his inward triumph and to assume the mask of indifference.
The moment of vengeance was at last come, and his proud heart exulted in the prospect of repaying
with interest the injuries of the Emperor. The future of CA own the enthusiasm, the restoration of

  The greatness
of the pay he promised attracted thousands, and the plentiful supplies the soldier was likely
to enjoy at the cost of the peasant, was to the latter an irresistible inducement to embrace
the military life at once, rather than be the victim of its oppression.  All the Austrian provinces
were compelled to assist in the equipment.  No class was exempt from taxation--no dignity or
privilege from capitation.  The Spanish court, as well as the King of Hungary, agreed to contribute
a considerable sum. The ministers made large presents, while Wallenstein himself advanced 200,000
dollars from his own income to hasten the armament.  The poorer officers he supported out of
his own revenues; and, by his own example, by brilliant promotions, and still more brilliant
promises, he induced all, who were able, to raise troops at their own expense.  Whoever raised
a corps at his own cost was to be its commander.  In the appointment of officers, religion
made no difference.  Riches, bravery and experience were more regarded than creed. But it was
not thus ne'er been some edifice choice-of another. An educator i

  His pledged word was the only security on which
their bold expectations rested; a blind reliance on his omnipotence, the only tie which linked
together in one common life and soul the various impulses of their zeal. There was an end of
the good fortune of each individual, if he retired, who alone was the voucher of its fulfilment.

However little Wallenstein was serious in his refusal, he successfully employed this means
to terrify the Emperor into consenting to his extravagant conditions.  The progress of the
enemy every day increased the pressure of the Emperor's difficulties, while the remedy was
also close at hand; a word from him might terminate the general embarrassment. "him told him all about

life; and nothing but the wish to oblige the Emperor had induced him, reluctantly enough, to
relinquish for a time his blissful repose."
