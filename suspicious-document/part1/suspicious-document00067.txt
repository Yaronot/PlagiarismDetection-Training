"I left Hampton still working as a water boy and went to Quire Creek, Bell Plains, Va., a place
near Harper's Ferry. Only
the part of retrochoir, looking to the west, the left penetrate pierced rosettes some clarity
melancholy .....--¡ religious do not know what sadness filled my heart!

There, in the distance, I spotted the dying light of a lamp that burned behind the main altar
was .-- Chapel of Healing, where lies the body of Ms Urraca of Castile,
as the grave lay his statue.

Sexton said that when in 1828 Fernando VII and Queen Amalia, his wife, returning from the Basque provinces,
wanted to see and did discover the remains of the illustrious daughter
Alfonso VI of Castile, and then went to admire the extraordinary length
of the skeleton .-- Nothing less than nine spans tall must have had
the unfortunate wife of the Warrior!

Then I went down to the famous Cueva de San Antolin or San Antonio, patron saint of the city,
sanctuary underground mystique serves as base to the great temple that is over: I admired then,
almost to grope, I mean by the light of both phosphorus (as the cathedral was left in the dark
and the sexton had gone out and lost the candle inside the crypt), the magnificent stalls Choir,
the gates and the pulpit, I fought to roughly the same clerk, committed when we returned to
lower, with a lantern, to this underground, which seems to be his right eye I argued, as was
true and positive, he was hungry, the clock marched relentlessly Diligence and went on his
way to nine o'clock, and I could finally leave the church and take
the road from the inn, almost suspicious that my guide for black socks
are I have been glad to stay for life doing penance in the Cueva de
San Antolin .....

Walking the streets lit and I observed that in
Palencia are women much more beautiful than in other towns of Castile.

V

Nothing I can say from eighteen to twenty miles there from Palencia
to Alar - were spent sleeping.

What are today, then, for me those lands that ran through my body, my soul while traveling on the
other hand, perhaps by the Alcarria, perhaps for Andalusia? What is life for an old; what our struggles
are political or philosophical disputes, eg, for pastors Sierra de Gredos, what must be, for example,
to my friends the nuns Ocaña the death of Lord Byron !.....--¡ Damn the thing!

Ten hours was arrested in Alar del Rey, store wheat and flour used for the movement by the Canal
de Castilla and a railway station to Santander will over time, but now only goes to Reinosa .....

At
four in the afternoon he is finally a train to this point .....--
The train consisted of three or four cars, occupied by ten or twelve
people .....

It seemed that a shadow of rail ..... But I rejoice
in the soul to do those nine leagues so lonely and comfortably, running
from one window to another to admire superb mountain landscapes, which
were mistaken for trees, rocks, weeds, viaducts, lawns, cottages,
tunnels, dumps, forests, streams, bridges ..... All the charms of
nature and civilization!

 When I moved around
here, I paid cash for this home.

"Did slaves ever run away! Lord yes, all the time. There,
they also won over Don Juan Pacheco, the Marquis of Villena and Don IÃ±igo LÃ³pez of Mendoza
el de Santillana. Kings, nobles and poets fought side by side; to win Castile and , they say, to guard
the glory of the prince, Don Enrique, who would later be known as,
Enrique IV, the Impotent!

Secondly, the honor of Castile was damaged by the winners and losers, by the nobles and by the king, demonstrating
as a testimony to history, when the kings do not represent the interests
of their people, the laurel in their hands becomes a funeral lamentation.

But, let us leave history to the respect of the printed law that governs
us.

From Madrid to Valladolid it is thirty-four leagues to the summit, which is a twenty-three hour
march.--Well, I arrived in the Ciudad de Don Ãlvaro de Luna at five
in the morning.

And, already the heat was tolerable, the air flowing and pleasant
vegetation.

There was a river crossing for boats full of bathers. There were thorny trees, beautiful bathhouses
and a street called las Moreras, where I studied a group of women from Valladolid one late Sunday afternoon.
And, there was a large field, a walk at night much longer than the village of Prado and Corte.
Everyone predicted a very promising future for Valladolid.

The railway, that called with its doors, will develop the elements
of wealth possessed by this very ancient country, along with industry,
livestock and agriculture.

In the present state, there are enduing paper mills, textile industries, bakeries, chemical
manufacturers, flour mills, boiler makers, beer, leather, button,
glue manufacturers, the fabrication of metals, foundries, lace makers,
silver workers, blacksmiths... Many of these are on a small scale,
but with the capacity of great prosperity and life.

As to artistic beauty, historical events, national glories, Valladolid is, as we are told, the Seville
of the north. I visited the cathedral, or rather a fragment of what was constructed, but studying the
plans and projects of Juan de Herrera that are kept at the Cabildo, I understood that if the great
architect had not abandoned his work at the Escorial, Spain would
today have a Renaissance church worthy to be alongside St. Peter's
in Rome.

Still, in the reduced proportions, the cathedral at Valladolid imposes a coarse and solemn soul
of magnitude...Its appearance is like a stone elephant, an Indian
pagoda, a prideful mountain.

All the desecration imposed upon this great unfortunate Churriqueresque
building dissapeared and remains buried under the noble Doric facade,
so pure and impressive as those Corinthian pillars which were equivalent
to other monuments. But, my letter would never end, if one were to list,
not to describe to you, all the artistry and poetry found in this
immense necropolis of our history, called Valladolid.

What is not said, is more of the principal.
 Is he in heaven!
No, he ain't in heaven! Went past heaven. He was clerk an' was he tough! Sometimes he beat
'em until they couldn't work. Give 'em more work than they could do. (Thinking of Fidel). Thanks to the new Legislation, I can see the
outside world for a half-hour every day.

Why has this come to pass?

Indeed, for thirty minutes I may look, but what will I see? A dim light,
her face thickly veiled, in a state of kneeling, eyes fixed on her
book... Rouge Veil! the poor knees of her soul!

Entering from the doorway, Amparo crosses in front without looking
at anyone, eyes staring at the floor.

I exclaim that Amparo knows that his beloved is there and by stealth
he can see her entirely, from head to foot.

Listening Amparo in a state of love, imagines a day of procession an celebration had Fidel in front
of a balcony full of friends, been free for but 3 hours, unveiled,
her gentle body, dressed in light clothes free and unrestrained.

What a transformation!... Fidel happy, playful, generous and fair!

On
her person lay treasures of silver, diamonds, pearls and rubies.

From her came a voice unique and unlike any other person alive.

No one else can put words to the deathless beauty of the Jeweled Princess.
In this It is true Amparo was right. One day, after from tending to
a sick relative with one of his crass brothers, caught a glimpse
of a blurry sight.

Amparo in the muffled dark and silent streets, catches sight of what
looks like Fidel, but in such a place and time the shadows and distance
can distort and trick a man and in Excited eagerness Fidel runs to
light to see clearly and approaching with the light came also the
very real touch.

 She was soon to be married, an' she turns 'roun an' sez to us. Which of
yer niggers think I'm gonna git when I git married? 

Nothing can be as interesting for the people of the New World as the study of the societies of Spain. The
societies of both of the regions are very consistent in the fundamentals in particular how education
is important above all. They should be compared to see where the same fundamentals such as the same
institutions cause the same results while giving consideration to the geographical differences.
My quick three month trip to Spain is inadequate to make a solid assessment of this particularly
as within Europe Spain's society and people are unique due to the ethnicity and geography of the
region. I also did not have enough time to visit several regions that I consider especially important such
as Extremadura, Galicia, Asturias, Aragon and Navarra that deserve special attention for various
reasons. However I can make some general observations from my quick visit to the rest of Spain. Primarily
they consist of four major social groups. To Summarize: What opinions can be expressed about
the character, customs, institutions, economic situation, literature,
and the future of Spain?

Is it the Spanish people are similar and harmonious? Has the constitutional system of Spain had a real
affect on Spain as a society and state? What has been the influence of the revolutions of
the current century? What hope can be found in the current situation? I will try to answer
these questions as concisely as possible. Spain can be considered to have three different faces.
The faces are divided both legally and politically. The amount each of these affects it varies widely
depending on how it is evaluated.

 After the war they tried to fool the slaves 'bout freedom an' wanted to keep 'em
on a workin' but the Yankees told 'em they wuz free. Customs are generally
free, the violent passions, especially in Málaga and Valencia openness is great. Women generally
lacking in shyness. Vanity is not uncommon in all classes.

The population of the second group (comprising more than half the total of Spain on the continent)
is of a type generally lower, or the less beautiful of the country. The faces are severe and
cold, but without harshness, and its very sharp lines. There are beautiful no rates seduction
but majesty. General inclination to leisure, and untidy in habits. Strong instincts of begging.
The feeling of personality much less vigorous than in other groups.
Remarkable tendency to mysticism. Luis de Santa María, including guards Monastery Yuste, list
below that are potentates and kings.

"Shortly after he joined two other Cenobites cited several godly men also wanted to devote himself
to a life of seclusion and asceticism, among which stood out soon John (of Robledillo) and Andrew
(Plasencia), whose names do not say the chronicles, designating only with the people they were
born, and together dedicáronse to build their Cells on the land donated by Martin Sancho, which
is now occupied by the Bakery, House Bishop and stables. Those cells were at first very rough and
small, which suited the purpose of the founders, who did not fail to continue to care also
Chapel of the Savior and pray it daily.

"Five years of rest, prayer and penance spent those lonely there, but towards the end of 1406
officers tithes they began to turn his attention to the Brothers of the Poor life, a name
that had adopted the hermits established along the stream to Yuste. Negábanse them to pay
the contribution required of them, based on the scarcity of your garden products and artifacts,
and, pressured by the officers, went to D. Vicente Arias, Bishop of Plasencia, for exempting
them from tithing.

The archbishop refused the application He immediately ordered and they paid everything they were required.

"Troubled
surprised as the Brothers of the poor life as pungent and unexpected resolution agreed to forward
to Pope Benedict XIII a petition requesting permission to erect a chapel to St. Paul the Hermit,
and Juan de Plasencia and Andrew Robledillo encargáronse to bring the application to Rome. They
finally came to the Eternal City, after a long and painful walking and begging, and arrojáronse
at the feet of His Holiness, who not only gave them what they asked, but gave them a bull bells,
bell, cemetery and licensed to celebrate Mass in solitude all the hermits that priests were .-- This provision
took effect in 1407.

"Outstanding was the joy they experienced and for which they were received in the two Yuste Boldly
commissioners, who, two days after his arrival, he presented with the Bull to the Bishop of
Plasencia, in order that ordered his execution. But the bishop, thinking wounded in their dignity,
if only I could be pregnant in their self-esteem, and this triumph of Cenobites humble, recklessly
refused obedience to the pontifical mandate, and ordered to a certain Fray Hernando called religious
Yuste and pass to seize the property of the hermits, besides dismissing their cells .-- This
was verified the priesthood, and the Brothers of the Poor Quac life
down to where the public charity and alms were given shelter.

"Not discouraged the Cenobites, and men were easy to overcome the two newcomers Rome .-- Quite the
contrary: these tireless men, without a break from his long and painful pilgrimage, on they went to
Tordesillas, then residence of Prince Fernando, brother the King of Castile D. Suffering Henry
III, and explained to him their grievances, asking for protection against the Bishop of Plasencia.
Positive response to the two commissioners reached in the mind of that illustrious prince, who
began, by dint of careful and restrained, by giving them a letter
to the same prelate Arias, in which he begged him to return the goods
to the Brothers the poor life and let them make use of the grant of
the Pope. Massa Williams uster play wif 'em; then
dey got so bad that they'ud run an' grab 'is laige so's he couldn't hardly walk so when he
sees 'em he jes' shoots in de air. Ol' Massa, he, jes' come on up ter the cabin an' say "mammy
whah dat boy?" She say, in dah undah the bed. Yer done scared 'im to deaf! He died at age 21, in September of 1958.

His life was spent in never-ending campaign, and regular occurrences, a life of duty. Charles V
abdicated the States of Flanders. Here are some words from his speech,
given a few months before leaving for Yuste, shared with his son
