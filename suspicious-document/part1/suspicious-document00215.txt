In 1911 the Air Battalion of the Royal Engineers, consisting of Headquarters, No. 1 Company
(Airships) and No. 2 Company (Aeroplanes), was formed and superseded the Balloon School. The
creation of No. 2 Company, stationed at Larkhill, marked the first formation of a British military
unit composed entirely of heavier-than-air aircraft. No beings were exhausted of things, seeking

 The Military Wing was to form a single and complete organization and contain a headquarters,
seven aeroplane squadrons, each to consist of twelve active machines and six in reserve, one
airship and kite squadron, and a flying depôt. All pilots, whether of the Naval or the Military
Wing, were eventually to graduate at the Central Flying School, whence they could join either
the Naval Wing at Eastchurch or one of the Military Squadrons. In time of war each branch of
the Service was to form a reserve for the other if required.

In accordance with this scheme I received instructions to organize, recruit, train and command

 The type of machine required; the method of obtaining it from
a struggling industry; its use and maintenance; the personnel, its training and equipment;
these, and a thousand other aspects of the question, required the employment of a large staff
of experts. But the experts did not exist and the duties were carried out almost entirely at
Farnborough, where in addition time had to be found to compile the official training and other
text books and regulations required for an entirely new arm.

In addition to the innumerable problems inherent in the organization, growth and training of
the Military Wing, the two years between its inception and the outbreak of war were strenuously
applied to solving the problems of air tactics and strategy. Until the South African War the
British Army had been drilled under the influence of stereotyped Prussian ideas. Brassy rake-off
