"What Giant is this, my Lord?" said the Marquis; "is your castle haunted by giants and goblins?"

"Lord! what, has not your Greatness heard the story of the Giant in the gallery-chamber?" cried
Bianca.  "I marvel his Highness has not told you; mayhap you do not know there is a prophecy--"

"This trifling is intolerable," interrupted Manfred.  "Let us dismiss this silly wench, my
Lord! we have more important affairs to discuss."

"By your favour," said Frederic, "these are no trifles.  The enormous sabre I was directed
to in the wood, yon casque, its fellow--are these visions of this poor maiden's brain?"

"So Jaquez thinks, may it please your Greatness," said Bianca.  "He says this moon will not
be out without our seeing some strange revolution.  For my part, I should not be surprised
if it was to happen to-morrow; for, as I was saying, when I heard the clattering of armour,
I was all in a cold sweat.  I looked up, and, if your Greatness will believe me, I saw upon
the uppermost banister of the great stairs a hand in armour as big as big.  I thought I should
have swooned.  I never stopped until I came hither--would I were well out of this castle. 
My Lady Matilda told me but yester- morning that her Highness Hippolita knows something."

"Thou art an insolent!" cried Manfred.  "Lord Marquis, it much misgives me that this scene
is concerted to affront me.  Are my own domestics suborned to spread tales injurious to my
honour?  Pursue your claim by manly daring; or let us bury our feuds, as was proposed, by the
intermarriage of our children.  But trust me, it ill becomes a Prince of your bearing to practise
on mercenary wenches."

"I scorn your imputation," said Frederic.  "Until this hour I never set eyes on this damsel:
I have given her no jewel.  My Lord, my Lord, your conscience, your guilt accuses you, and
would throw the suspicion on me; but keep your daughter, and think no more of Isabella.  The
judgments already fallen on your house forbid me matching into it."

  He now
wished to find Hippolita in the disposition her Lord had promised.  The portents that had alarmed
him were forgotten in his desires.  Stealing softly and unobserved to the apartment of Hippolita,
he entered it with a resolution to encourage her acquiescence to the divorce, having perceived
that Manfred was resolved to make the possession of Isabella an unalterable condition, before
he would grant Matilda to his wishes.

The Marquis was not surprised at the silence that reigned in the Princess's apartment.  Concluding
her, as he had been advertised, in her oratory, he passed on.  The door was ajar; the evening
gloomy and overcast.  Pushing open the door gently, he saw a person kneeling before the altar.
As he approached nearer, it seemed not a woman, but one in a long woollen weed, whose back
was towards him.  The person seemed absorbed in prayer.  The Marquis was about to return, when
the figure, rising, stood some moments fixed in meditation, without regarding him.  The Marquis,
expecting the holy person to come forth, and meaning to excuse his uncivil interruption, said,

"Reverend Father, I sought the Lady Hippolita."

"Hippolita!" replied a hollow voice; "camest thou to this castle to seek Hippolita?" and then
the figure, turning slowly round, discovered to Frederic the fleshless jaws and empty sockets
of a skeleton, wrapt in a hermit's cowl.

"Angels of grace protect me!" cried Frederic, recoiling.

"Deserve their protection!" said the Spectre.  Frederic, falling on his knees, adjured the
phantom to take pity on him.

"Dost thou not remember me?" said the apparition.  "Remember the wood of Joppa!"

"Art thou that holy hermit?" cried Frederic, trembling.  "Can I do aught for thy eternal peace?"

"Wast thou delivered from bondage," said the spectre, "to pursue carnal delights?  Hast thou
forgotten the buried sabre, and the behest of Heaven engraven on it?"

"I have not, I have not," said Frederic; "but say, blest spirit, what is thy errand to me?
What remains to be done?"

"To forget Matilda!" said the apparition; and vanished.

Frederic's blood froze in his veins.  For some minutes he remained motionless.  Then falling
prostrate on his face before the altar, he besought the intercession of every saint for pardon.
A flood of tears succeeded to this transport; and the image of the beauteous Matilda rushing
in spite of him on his thoughts, he lay on the ground in a conflict of penitence and passion.
Ere he could recover from this agony of his spirits, the Princess Hippolita with a taper in
her hand entered the oratory alone.  Seeing a man without motion on the floor, she gave a shriek,
concluding him dead.  Her fright brought Frederic to himself.  Rising suddenly, his face bedewed
with tears, he would have rushed from her presence; but Hippolita stopping him, conjured him
in the most plaintive accents to explain the cause of his disorder, and by what strange chance
she had found him there in that posture.

"Ah, virtuous Princess!" said the Marquis, penetrated with grief, and stopped.

"For the love of Heaven, my Lord," said Hippolita, "disclose the cause of this transport! 
What mean these doleful sounds, this alarming exclamation on my name?  What woes has heaven
still in store for the wretched Hippolita?  Yet silent!  By every pitying angel, I adjure thee,
noble Prince," continued she, falling at his feet, "to disclose the purport of what lies at
thy heart.  I see thou feelest for me; thou feelest the sharp pangs that thou inflictest--speak,
for pity!  Does aught thou knowest concern my child?"

"I cannot speak," cried Frederic, bursting from her.  "Oh, Matilda!"

Quitting the Princess thus abruptly, he hastened to his own apartment.  At the door of it he
was accosted by Manfred, who flushed by wine and love had come to seek him, and to propose
to waste some hours of the night in music and revelling.  Frederic, offended at an invitation
so dissonant from the mood of his soul, pushed him rudely aside, and entering his chamber,
flung the door intemperately against Manfred, and bolted it inwards.  The haughty Prince, enraged
at this unaccountable behaviour, withdrew in a frame of mind capable of the most fatal excesses. With
such commercial windows, the impression on the richer paradigm necessarily become, as Mr. Pimsoll,

  Theodore, scarce less distracted,
and only mastering the transports of his grief to assist Matilda, had now by his cries drawn
some of the monks to his aid.  While part of them endeavoured, in concert with the afflicted
Theodore, to stop the blood of the dying Princess, the rest prevented Manfred from laying violent
hands on himself.

Matilda, resigning herself patiently to her fate, acknowledged with looks of grateful love
the zeal of Theodore.  Yet oft as her faintness would permit her speech its way, she begged
the assistants to comfort her father.  Jerome, by this time, had learnt the fatal news, and
reached the church.  His looks seemed to reproach Theodore, but turning to Manfred, he said,
