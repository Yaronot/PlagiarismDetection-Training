INTRODUCTION TO THE HISTORY OF RELIGIONS

CHAPTER I

NATURE OF RELIGION

+1+. It appears probable that primitive men endowed with their own qualities every seemingly
active object in the world. Experience forced them to take note of the relations of all objects
to themselves and to one another. The knowledge of the sequences of phenomena, so far as the
latter are not regarded as acting intentionally on him, constitutes man's science and philosophy;
so far as they are held to act on him intentionally, the knowledge of them constitutes his
theory of religion, and his sense of relation with them is his religious sentiment. Science
and religion are coeval in man's history, and both are independently continuous and progressive.
At first science is in the background because most objects, since they are believed to be alive
and active, are naturally supposed by man to affect him purposely; it grows slowly, keeping
pace with observation, and constantly abstracting phenomena from the domain of religion.[1]
Religion is man's attitude toward the universe regarded as a social and ethical force; it is
the sense of social solidarity with objects regarded as Powers, and the institution of social
relations with them.

+2+. These Powers are thought of in general as mysterious, and as mightier than ordinary living
men.[2] Ordinarily the feeling toward them on man's part is one of dependence--he is conscious
of his inferiority. In some forms of philosophic thought the man regards himself as part of
the one universal personal Power, or as part of the impersonal Whole, and his attitude toward
the Power or the Whole is like that of a member of a composite political body toward the whole
body; such a position is possible, however, only in a period of very advanced culture.

+3+. There being no records of initial humanity, it is hardly possible for us to know certainly
what the earliest men's feeling was toward the animate and inanimate forces around them. Not
improbably it was simply fear, the result of ignorance of their nature and absence of social
relations with them. But in the human communities known to us, even the lowest, the relations
with extrahuman beings appear to be in general of a mixed nature, sometimes friendly, sometimes
unfriendly, but neither pure love nor pure hatred. So refined a feeling as love for a deity
is not found among savages. As religion springs from the human demand for safety and happiness
as the gift of the extrahuman Powers, hostility to them has been generally felt to be opposed
to common sense.[3] Coercion there has been, as in magical procedures, or to bring a stubborn
deity to terms; and occasional antagonism (for example, toward foreign gods); but not hatred
proper as a dogma, except in the great ethical religions toward evil spirits, and in certain
elaborate philosophic systems--as, for example, in the Gnostic conception of an imperfect Demiurge,
or in the assumption of an original blind Chance or blind Will whose products and laws are
regarded as not entitled to respect and obedience.

+4+. Instead of complete friendliness and unfriendliness in early tribes we find more commonly
between the two a middle ground of self-regarding equipoise. The savage, the half-civilized
man, and the peasant often deal with superhuman Powers in a purely selfish commercial spirit,
courting or neglecting them as they seem likely to be useful or not. The Central Australian
(who may be credited with a dim sense of the superhuman) conducts his ceremonies, intended
to insure a supply of food, apparently without the slightest emotion of any sort except the
desire for gain.[4] The Italian peasant, who has vowed a wax candle to a saint in return for
a favor to be shown, does not scruple to cheat the saint, after the latter has performed his
part of the agreement, by offering tallow instead of wax, if he thinks he can do so with impunity.
A recusant deity is sometimes neglected or even kicked by way of punishment or to force him
to give the desired aid, and a god or a saint is valued and sought after in proportion to his
supposed ability to be useful.

+5+. And this naïvely utilitarian point of view is by no means confined to the lowest forms
of religion; in the Old Testament, for example, the appeal to Yahveh is generally based on
his assumed power to bestow temporal blessings,[5] and this is a widespread attitude at the
present day in religious communities, where salvation is commonly the end had in view by the
worshiper. Love toward the deity simply on account of his personal moral character, without
regard to the benefit (namely happiness) to be got from him, is found, if found at all, only
in highly cultivated natures, and is rare in these. And, in truth, it is difficult if not impossible
to justify religion except on the ground that it brings satisfaction (that is, happiness through
and in perfection of nature) in the broadest and highest sense of that term, for otherwise
it could not be regarded as a good thing.

+6+. On the other hand, fear of the superhuman Power is a common feeling, recognizable everywhere,
at all times, and in all stages of social and intellectual development. By many it is regarded
as the original and essential attitude of the religious mind.[6] To this view it is sometimes
objected that religion could never have arisen from fear--that religion, as a cult, of necessity
involves amicable relations between man and the deity. The objection, however, is based on
an arbitrary and incorrect definition of religion; it is quite conceivable that man might cultivate
the deity through fear of the latter's displeasure, and that an elaborate system of ceremonies
and beliefs might arise from the desire to avert his anger. Such a conception--which is certainly
not a lofty one--is not unnatural in the presence of a great Power whose dispositions and purposes
are not well understood; numerous examples of such an attitude might be cited from various
religions, savage and civilized.

+7+. But, on historical grounds, as in the examples given above, it seems better to say that
the earliest known attitude of man toward the superhuman Power is one of interested observation
and fluid emotion--the feeling is determined by experience of phenomena. The man is pleased,
displeased and afraid, suspicious or careless, according as he sees things to be helpful, harmful,
doubtful, or resultless. In process of time, by observation and reflection, he succeeds in
tabulating phenomena, and more or less definitely fixing his emotional attitude toward their
assumed cause. A tradition is gradually established, and men are trained from infancy to welcome
certain things, to fear others, and to accept certain others as meaningless; from time to time
strange things will appear, and these will be treated according to established principles or
will remain mysterious. A germinal conception of natural law will arise from the observation
of periodically occurring phenomena (such as the rising and setting of the sun, periodic rains,
tides) and familiar facts of everyday life, as, for example, the habits of men and other animals.
Everything outside this sphere will be ascribed to extrahuman agency--so sickness, death, and
sometimes birth.[7]

+8+. The history of religion, which is a part of the history of thought, necessarily shows,
as is observed above, a constant enlargement of the domain of natural law, and a consequent
contraction of the direct action of the supernatural, though this does not always or generally
lessen the conviction that the Supernatural Power, acting through natural law, controls all
things. In this process, also, the conception of the attitude of the Supernatural Power is
more or less definitely fixed; a formulation of signs is accomplished, whereby it is known
whether the deity, at particular moments, is pleased or displeased, and whether a given deity
is generally friendly or hostile. This method of determining the attitude of the deity continued
into late stages of social life, and still exists even in professedly Christian communities.[8]

+9+. As the basis of the religious feeling we must suppose a sense and conception of an extrahuman
Something, the cause of things not otherwise understood. All things were supposed to have life,
and therefore to be loci of force; man's sense of social relation with this force constituted
his religion. This sense was at first doubtless vague, ill-defined, or undefined, and in this
form it is now found in certain tribes.[9] Gradually, as the processes of human life and of
the external world become better known, and the vastness of the extrahuman control becomes
evident, the Something is conceived of as great, then as indefinitely great, and finally, under
the guidance of philosophic thought, as infinite. Thus the sense of the infinite may be said
to be present in man's mind in germinal form at the beginning of truly human life, though it
does not attain full shape, is not formulated, and is not effective, till the period of philosophic
culture is reached.[10]

+10+. As far as our present knowledge goes, religion appears to be universal among men. There
is no community of which we can say with certainty that it is without religion. There are some
doubtful cases--for example, certain Australian tribes reported on by Spencer and Gillen, among
whom it is difficult to discover any definite religious feeling: they offer no sacrifices or
petitions, and appear to recognize no personal relations with any supernatural Power, beyond
the belief that the spirits of the dead are active in their midst, causing sickness, death,
and birth; nor is there any sign that they have lost earlier more definite beliefs.[11] Yet
they have solemn ceremonies in which human blood plays a great part, and these may have reference
to the intervention of supernatural beings, the term "supernatural" being taken as expressing
any mysterious fact lying outside of the common course of things. A mysterious being called
Twan is spoken of in initiation ceremonies, chiefly, it seems, to frighten or train the boys.
Is there an indication that the tribal leaders have risen above the popular belief in such
a being? Experience shows that it is difficult for civilized men to get at the religious ideas
of savages; and it is possible, in spite of the careful investigations thus far made, that
the last word on Central Australian beliefs has not yet been spoken. A similar reserve must
be exercised in regard to reports of certain other tribes, whose ceremonies and institutions
have appeared to some European and American observers to be without a religious element.[12]

+11+. There is at present no satisfactory historical evidence (whatever psychological ground
there may be, or whatever deduction from the theory of evolution may seem necessary) of the
existence of a subreligious stage of human life--a stage in which there is only a vague sense
of some extrahuman power affecting man's interests, without definition of the power, and without
attempt to enter into social relations with it.[13]

+12+. True, in the great mass of existing savage humanity we find social and religious customs
so definite that we are forced to suppose a long preceding period of development. It has even
been held that traces of religious conceptions are discernible in the first surviving records
of "prehistoric" man, the contemporary of the cave bear--a period separated from the earliest
clear historical records by many millenniums;[14] but, though the existence of such conceptions
is by no means improbable, the alleged traces are too dim to build a theory on. The supposition
of a continuous religious development from the earliest times is in accord with all that we
know of human history, but, until more facts come to light, it will be prudent to reserve opinion
as to the character of prehistoric religion.[15]

+13+. In general, religious development goes hand in hand with social organization. Those groups
which, like the Rock Veddas of Ceylon (described by Sarasin) and the Yahgans of Tierra del
Fuego (described by Hyades and Deniker), have scarcely any clan organization, have also scarcely
any religion. In most of the lowest communities known to us we find well-constituted clans
and tribes, with strict (and usually complicated) laws of relationship and marriage, and a
somewhat developed form of religion.[16] Here again it is evident that we see in the world
only the later stages of a long social process; the antecedent history of this process belongs
to sociological science, and does not concern us here;[17] its later history is inseparably
connected with the development of religion.

+14+. It is in this social process that science, philosophy, art, and ethics are constructed,
and these, though distinct from the religious sentiment, always blend with it into a unity
of life. Religion proper is simply an attitude toward a Power; the nature and activity of the
Power and the mode of approaching it are constructed by man's observation and reflection. The
analysis of the external world and of man's body and mind, the discovery of natural laws, the
history of the internal and external careers of the human race--this is the affair of science
and philosophy; rules of conduct, individual and communal, grow up through men's association
with one another in society, their basis being certain primary instincts of self-assertion
and sympathy; art is the product of the universal sense of beauty. All these lines of growth
stand side by side and coalesce in unitary human life.

+15+. The external history of religion is the history of the process by which the religious
sentiment has attached itself to the various conceptions formed by man's experience: ritual
is the religious application of the code of social manners; the gods reflect human character;
churches follow the methods of social organization; monotheism springs from the sense of the
physical and moral unity of the world. Ideas concerning the nature and functions of the deity,
the nature of the soul and of conscience, and future life are all products of scientific thought
and might exist if religion did not exist, that is, if men did not recognize any practical
relations between themselves and the deity. But, as a matter of fact, the religious sentiment,
coexisting with these ideas, has always entered into alliance with them, creating nothing,
but appropriating everything. Supernatural sanctions and emotional coloring are products of
general experience and feeling. The intellectual and ethical content of religion varies with
the intellectual and ethical culture of its adherents; we may speak properly of the philosophy
and morals, not of a religion, but of the people who profess it.

+16+. The internal history of religion is the history of individual religious emotional experience
(a phenomenon that hardly appears at all in the records of early life), and becomes especially
interesting only in periods of advanced culture. It is true that this experience is based on
the whole reflective life of man, whose beginnings go back to the earliest times. Aspirations
and ideals, connected especially with man's religious life, spring from the long line of experiences
with which men have always been struggling. The central fact of the higher religious experience
is communion and union with the deity, and the roots of this conception are found in all the
religious ideas and usages that have been formulated and practiced in human history. The study
of such ideas and practices is thus important for the understanding of the later more refined
spiritual life, as in turn this latter throws light on its crude predecessors. It is no disparagement
to the higher forms of thought that they have grown from feeble beginnings, and it does not
detract from the historical value of primitive life that we must decline to credit it with
depth and refinement. Every phase and every stadium of human experience has its value, and
the higher stages must be estimated by what they are in themselves. In the history of religion
the outward and the inward elements have stood side by side in a unitary experience. But, though
the deeper feeling is necessarily more or less closely connected with the external history,
it is an independent fact requiring a separate treatment, and will be only occasionally referred
to in the present volume.

CHAPTER II

THE SOUL

+17+. The doctrine of the soul is so interwoven with the history of religious beliefs that
a brief statement of its early forms will be appropriate before we enter on the consideration
of religious institutions and ideas.[18]

1. NATURE OF THE SOUL

+18+. The belief in an interior something in man, different from the body, appears to be practically
universal in early human history; the ideas concerning the nature of the soul have changed
from time to time, but no tribe of men has yet been found in which it is certain that there
is no belief in its existence. The Central Australians, religiously one of the least-developed
communities known, believe in ghosts, and a ghost presupposes some sort of substance different
from the ordinary body. Of some tribes, as the Pygmies of Central Africa and the Fuegians,
we have no exact information on this point. But in all cases in which there is information
traces of a belief in a soul are found. We are not concerned here with philosophic views, like
that of Buddhism and many modern psychologists, that do not admit the existence of the soul
as a separate entity. The proofs of the universality of the belief in a soul are scattered
through all books that deal with man's religious constitution and history.[19]

+19+. For the basis of a universal fact of human experience we naturally seek a universal or
essential element of human thought. In this case we must assume a natural or instinctive conviction
of the existence of an internal life or being--a consciousness (at first doubtless dim and
vague) of something diverse and separate from the visible physical being, a sense of mental
activity in thought, feeling, and will.

+20+. It is not surprising that we do not meet with the expression of such a consciousness
among savages: partly, as is well known, they are like children, intellectually incapable of
formulating their instinctive beliefs (and they have, consequently, no word to express such
a formulation); partly, they are not disposed to speak frankly on subjects that they regard
as sacred or mysterious. Attempts at formulation follow the lines of culture, and it is not
till a comparatively late stage that they reach definite shape.

+21+. The interior being, whose existence was vaguely felt, was recognized by early man in
many common experiences. Certain phenomena were observed that seemed to be universal accompaniments
of life, and these, by a strictly scientific method of procedure, were referred to an inward
living thing. It was hardly possible for early observers not to notice that when the breath
ceased the life ceased; hence many peoples have regarded the breath as the life, and as the
form of the interior being, and in many languages the words for 'soul' and 'spirit' are derived
from the word for 'breath'.[20] The breath and therefore the soul of a dying man might be received
(inhaled) by any person present; it was sometimes obligatory on a son to receive his father's
last breath--he thereby acquired the father's qualities.[21]

+22+. Another accompaniment of the body that attracted the attention of early men was the shadow,
for which the science of that day, unacquainted with optical laws, could account only on the
supposition that it was a double of the man, another self, a something belonging in the same
general category with the breath-soul, though usually distinguished from it.[22] The shadow
was regarded as a sort of independent objective being, which might be seized and destroyed,
for example, by a crocodile, as the man passed along a river bank; yet, as it was the man,
its destruction involved the man's death.[23] The soul, regarded as a shadow, could not cast
a shadow. Similarly one's reflection in water was regarded as a double of him.[24]

+23+. Blood was known by observation in very early times to be intimately connected with life,
acquired the mystery and sacredness that attached to life, and has played a great part in religious
ceremonies.[25] As soul is life, a close relation between blood and soul appears in the thought
of lower and higher peoples, though the relation is not always the same as that described above.
The blood is sometimes said to be the soul,[26] sometimes the soul is supposed to be in the
blood as it is in the hair or any other part of the body. Blood could not be regarded as the
soul in the same sense in which the breath, for example, was the soul--if the breath departed
the man's life departed, but one could lose much blood without injury to vital power. It is
not to be expected that the relation between the two should be precisely defined in the early
stages of society. If Homer at one time speaks of the soul passing away through a wound and
at another time of the blood so passing (death being the result),[27] this variation must not
be pressed into a statement of the exact identity of blood and soul. By the Californian Maidu
the soul is spoken of as a 'heart', apparently by reason of the connection of the heart with
the blood and the life.[28] There is to be recognized, then, a vague identification of 'soul'
and 'blood'; but in common usage the two terms are somewhat differently employed--'soul' is
the vital entity, the man's personality, 'blood' is the representative of life, especially
on its social side (kinsmen are of "one blood," but not of "one soul")[29] and in offerings
to the deity. Early man seems, in fact, to have distinguished between life and soul.[30]

+24+. As the soul was conceived of as an independent being, it was natural that it should be
held to have a form like that of the external body--it could not be thought of otherwise.[31]
This opinion was doubtless confirmed in the savage mind by such experiences as dreams, visions,
hallucinations, and illusions, and by such phenomena as shadows and reflections. The dreamer
believed that he had been far away during the night, hunting or fighting, and yet the testimony
of his comrades convinced him that his body had not left its place; the logical conclusion
was that his inner self had been wandering, and this self, as it seemed to him, had walked,
eaten, hurled the spear, done all that the ordinary corporeal man would do. In dreams he saw
and conversed with his friends or his enemies, all in corporeal form, yet all of them asleep
in their several places; their souls also, he concluded, were wandering. Even in his waking
hours, in the gloom of evening or on some wide gleaming plain, he saw, as he thought, shadowy
shapes of persons who were dead or far away, and heard mysterious voices and other sounds,
which he would naturally refer to the inner self of the absent living or the dead. Reproductions
of himself and others appeared on land and in water. All such experiences would go to convince
him that there were doubles of himself and of others, and that these were corporeal--only dim,
ethereal, with powers greater than those of the ordinary external body.

+25+. While the soul of the living man was most commonly conceived of as a sublimated replica
of the ordinary body, it was also supposed in some cases to take the form of some animal--an
opinion that may have arisen as regards any particular animal from its appearance at a time
when the soul was supposed to be absent from the body,[32] and is to be referred ultimately
to the belief in the identity of nature of animals and man. The souls of the dead also were
sometimes supposed to take the shape of animals, or to take up their abode in animals[33] or
in trees (as in Egypt): such animals (tigers, for example) were commonly dangerous, and this
theory of incarnation is an expression of the widely diffused belief in the dangerous character
of the souls of the dead. In later, cultivated times the bird became a favorite symbol of the
soul--perhaps from its swift and easy flight through the air.[34]

+26+. Savage science, though it generally identified the soul with the breath, and regarded
it as a separate interior form, seems not to have attempted to define its precise locus, posture,
and extension within the body--the early man was content to regard it as a vague homunculus.
The whole body was looked on as the seat of life, and was sometimes eaten in order to acquire
its qualities, especially the quality of courage.[35] Life was supposed to reside in the bones
as the solid part of the body, and these were preserved as the basis of a future life.[36]
But even in early stages of culture we find a tendency to specialize--courage, for example,
was assigned particularly to the head and the heart, which were accounted the most desirable
parts of a dead enemy.[37] These organs were selected probably on account of their prominence--the
heart also because it was the receptacle of the blood. The soul was located by the Indians
of Guiana in the pupil of the eye.[38]

+27+. Gradually a more precise localization of qualities was made by the Semites, Greeks, Romans,
and other peoples. These, for reasons not clearly known to us, assigned the principal emotional
faculties to the most prominent organs of the trunk of the body. The Semites placed thought
and courage in the heart and the liver, anger in the liver (the bile), love and grief in the
bowels, voluntary power in the kidneys.[39] The Greeks and Romans were less definite: to the
heart, the diaphragm, and the liver (the upper half of the trunk); the Greeks assigned thought,
courage, emotion;[40] the Romans placed thought and courage in the heart, and the affections
in the liver. Among these organs special prominence came to be given to the heart and the liver
as seats of mental faculties.[41]

+28+. It is not clear how early the brain was supposed to be connected with the mind. Alcmæon
of Crotona (5th cent. B.C.), who, according to Diogenes Laertius, wrote chiefly on medical
subjects, is credited with the view that the brain was the constructor of thought.[42] Plato
suggests that the brain may be the seat of perception and then of memory and reflection, and
calls the head the most divine part of man.[43] Cicero reports that some persons looked on
some part of the cerebrum as the chief seat of the mind.[44] In the Semitic languages the first
occurrence of a term for 'brain' is in the Arabic.[45] Some American tribes are said to regard
the brain as the seat of the mind.[46] The scientific Greek view appears to have been connected
with medical research, but the process by which it was reached has not been recorded. The Arabic
conception of the brain was probably borrowed from the Greeks.

+29+. The soul as an independent personality was supposed to leave the body at times, and its
departure entailed various consequences--in general the result was the withdrawal of the man's
ordinary powers to a greater or less extent, according to the duration of the soul's absence.
The consequences might be sleep, trance, swoon, coma, death; the precise nature of the effect
was determined by the man's subsequent condition--he would wake from sleep, or return to his
ordinary state from a trance, or come to himself from a swoon, or lie permanently motionless
in death. When he seemed to be dead there was often doubt as to his real condition--the escaped
soul might seek its old abode (as in the case of the vampire, for instance), and means were
sometimes taken to prevent its return.[47]

+30+. The obvious difference in serious results between sleep and other cessations of the ordinary
consciousness and activity led among some tribes to the supposition of a special dream-soul
that could leave the body without injury to the man. It was believed by certain Greenlanders[48]
that a man going on a journey might leave his soul behind. It was a not uncommon opinion that
souls might be taken out for a while, with friendly intent, to guard them during a period of
danger (so in Celebes when a family moves into a new house). In Greenland, according to Cranz,
a damaged soul might be repaired. Or the soul might be removed with evil intent by magic art--the
result would be sickness or swoon; it was then incumbent on the sufferer or his friends to
discover the hostile magician and counteract his work by stronger magic, or force him to restore
the soul.[49] On the other hand, the soul of a dead man might be so recalled that the man would
live again, the usual agency being a god, a magician, or a prophet.

+31+. It has been and is a widespread opinion in low tribes that the life of a person is bound
up with that of an animal or plant, or with the preservation of something closely connected
with the person. This opinion springs from the conviction of the intimate vital relation between
men and their surroundings. From the combination of these beliefs with the view referred to
above[50] that a man's soul might dwell in a beast or a plant, the idea of the hidden soul,
common in folk-lore, may have arisen[51]--the idea that one might conceal his soul in some
unsuspected place and then would be free from fear of death so long as his soul remained undisturbed.[52]
These folk-tales are products of the popular imagination based on materials such as those described
above. From the early point of view there was no reason why the vital soul, an independent
entity, should not lead a locally separate life.

2. ORIGIN OF THE SOUL

+32+. Theories of a special origination of the soul belong only to the more advanced cults.
In early stages of culture the soul is taken as a natural part of the human constitution, and
though it is regarded as in a sort an independent entity, the analysis of the man is not carried
so far as to raise the question of separate beginnings of the two constituents of the personality,
except as this is partially involved in the hypothesis of reincarnation. The child is born
into the world equipped with all the capacities of man, and further investigation as to how
these capacities originally came is not made.

+33+. It was, however, thought necessary to account for the appearance of man (a clan or tribe)
on earth, and his creation was generally ascribed to a supernatural being. Every tribe has
its history of man's creation--the variety in the anthropogonic myths is endless, the diversities
depending on the differences of general culture and of surroundings; but the essential point
is the same in all; some god or other supernatural Power fashioned human creatures of different
sex, whether with well-considered aim or by caprice is not said.

+34+. The first pair is thus accounted for in a simple and generally satisfactory manner. But
the fact of the perpetuation of the tribe or the race appears to have offered serious difficulties
to the savage mind. Some tribes are reported to be ignorant of the natural cause of birth.
Some Melanesian women believe that the origin or beginning of a child is a plant (coconut or
other), and that the child will be the nunu (something like an echo) of that thing or of a
dead person (this is not the transition of a soul--the child takes the place of the dead person).
In Mota there is a similar belief.[53] The Central Australians, it is said, think that the
birth of a child is due to the entrance of a spirit into the body of a woman[54]--every child
is thus the reincarnation of some ancient person (an "ancestor"), and the particular person
is identified by the sacred object (stone or tree, or other object) near which the woman is
when she first becomes aware of the child within her; every such object (and there are many
of them near any village) represents some spirit whose name is known to the old men of the
tribe, and this name is given the child.[55]

+35+. Similar theories of birth are found among the Eskimo[56] and the Khonds,[57] in Melanesia,[58]
in West Africa,[59] and elsewhere.[60] Such views thus appear to have been widely diffused,
and are in fact a natural product of early biological science. They embody the earliest known
form of the doctrine of reincarnation, which is so important in the Buddhistic dogma.[61] With
it must be connected the fact that among many peoples (savage, half-civilized, and civilized)
birth was intimately connected with supernatural beings, whence the origin of numerous usages:
the precautions taken to guard the woman before delivery, the lustrations after the birth,
the couvade, the dread of menstrual and seminal discharges, and further, customs relating to
the arrival of boys and girls at the age of puberty.

+36+. At a later stage of culture the creation of the soul was distinguished from that of the
body, and was generally regarded as a special act of the deity: the Hebrews conceived that
the body was fashioned out of dust, and that the breath of life was breathed into it by God,
so that man became a "living soul"[62]; Plato at one time[63] thought that the soul of the
world was created by God, out of certain elements, before the body, and was made prior to it
in origin and excellence so that it should be its ruler, and that afterwards he placed separate
souls in the various separate bodies; the immortal gods, says Cicero, have placed souls (animos)
in human bodies, and the human soul has been plucked (decerptus) from the divine mind.[64]

+37+. In the early Christian centuries the question of how the soul came into the body was
an intensely practical one--it was closely connected with the question of man's inherent sinfulness
and his capacity for redemption. Tertullian's theory of the natural propagation of souls (traducianism),
which involved the inheritance of a sinful nature, was succeeded on the one hand by the theory
of preëxistence (adopted by Origen from Plato), and on the other hand by the view that every
soul was an immediate creation of God (creationism, held by Jerome and others), these both
assuming the natural goodness or untainted character of the soul at the birth of the human being.

+38+. The mysterious character of death, the final departure of the soul from the body, called
forth in savage communities feelings of awe and dread. As death, in the savage view, was due
to the intervention of a supernatural agency, the dead body and everything connected with it
partook of the sacredness that attached to the supernatural.[65] Hence, probably, many of the
customs relating to the treatment of corpses--taboos that survived into comparatively late
times.[66] The Old Testament ritual term 'unclean' is used of corpses and other things that
it was unlawful to touch, things taboo, and in this sense is equivalent to 'sacred.'[67]

3. POLYPSYCHISM

+39+. In the preceding section only the general fact of the existence of the soul is considered.
We find, however, a widespread belief among savage and half-civilized peoples that every human
body is inhabited by several souls (two or more).[68] Thus, the Fijians, the Algonkins, and
the Karens recognize two souls; the Malagasy, the Dahomi, and the Ashanti three; the Congoans
three or four, the Chinese three, the Dakotas four, the Malays (of the peninsula) seven; and
this list is not exhaustive.[69] To these various souls different procedures and functions
are assigned.

+40+. In general, as to place and function during the man's life, the following classes of
souls are distinguished: the vital soul, or the principle of life, whose departure leaves the
man insensible or dead (Malagasy aina, Karen kalah, Eẃe 'ghost-soul'); the dream-soul, which
wanders while the man is asleep (probably a universal conception in early stages of culture);
the shadow-soul, which accompanies him by day (also, probably, universal); the reflection-soul
(similar to the preceding); the beast-soul, or bush-soul, incarnate in a beast (among the Congoans,
the Eẃe, the Tshi, the Khonds), with which may be compared the Egyptian view that revenant
souls and Underworld shadows may assume the form of animals, and the Hindu metempsychosis.
A particular responsible moral soul is also reported (among the Karens),[70] but it is doubtful
whether this is native; and still more doubtful are the Karen 'reason' (tsō) and the Khond
beatified soul.[71]

+41+. In regard to procedure after the man's death, it is generally held in early stages of
culture that one soul stays with the body, or at the tomb, or in the village, or becomes air,
while another departs to the land of the dead (Fijians, Algonkins, and others), or is reborn
(Khonds), and in some cases a soul is said to vanish.[72]

+42+. It is obvious that there was great flexibility and indefiniteness in early theories of
the soul. The savage mind, feeling its way among its varied experiences, was disposed to imagine
a separate interior substance to account for anything that seemed to be a separate and valuable
manifestation of the man's personality. The number of souls varies with the number of phenomena
that it was thought necessary to recognize as peculiar, and the lines of demarcation between
different souls are not always strictly drawn. As to the manner of the souls' indwelling in
the body, and as to their relations one to another, savages have nothing definite to say, or,
at least, have said nothing. In general our information regarding savage psychical theories
is meager; it is not unlikely that with fuller acquaintance the details given above would have
to be modified, though the general fact of polypsychism would doubtless remain.

+43+. In the higher ancient religions there are only more or less obscure indications of an
earlier polypsychic system. The Egyptian distinction between soul (bai), shadow (haibet), and
double (ka) appears to involve such a system; but the Egyptologists of the present day are
not agreed as to the precise interpretation of these terms.[73] The Semitic terms nafs and
ruḥ (commonly rendered 'soul' and 'spirit' respectively) are of similar origin, both meaning
'wind,' 'breath'; in the literature they are sometimes used in the same sense, sometimes differentiated.
The 'soul' is the seat of life, appetite, feeling, thought--when it leaves the body the man
swoons or dies; it alone is used as a synonym of personality (a 'soul' often means simply a
'person'). 'Spirit,' while it sometimes signifies the whole nature, is also employed (like
English 'spirit') to express the tone of mind, especially courage, vigor. But, so far as the
conception of an interior being is concerned, the two terms are substantially identical in
the Semitic languages as known to us.[74] And though, as is noted above, 'spirit' is not used
for the human personality, it alone is the term in Hebrew for a class of subordinate supernatural
beings standing in close relations with the deity.[75] Greek literature seems to know only
one personal soul (psyche, with which pneuma is often identical in meaning); a quality of nature
(as in Semitic ruḥ) is sometimes expressed by pneuma ('spirit').[76] The thymos appears in
Homer to be merely a function of the psyche,[77] in any case it does not represent a separate
personality alongside of the psyche, and the same thing is true of the daimon. Similarly, in
Latin, animus and anima are substantially synonyms[78]--animus sometimes expressing tone of
mind--and spiritus is equivalent to ruḥ and pneuma; the individual genius, with its feminine
representative the juno, is a complicated and obscure figure, but it cannot be regarded as
a separate soul.[79]

+44+. This variety of terms in the more advanced religions may point to an early polypsychic
conception. The tendency was, with the progress of culture, to modify or efface this sort of
conception.[80] From a belief in a number of entities in the human interior being men passed
to a recognition of different sides or aspects of the inward life, and finally to the distinct
conception of the oneness of the soul. The movement toward psychic unity may be compared with
the movement toward monotheism by the unification of the phenomena of the external world.

4. FUTURE OF THE SOUL

+45+. Savage philosophy, recognizing the dual nature of man, regarded death as due to the departure
of the soul from the body. The cessation of breathing at death was matter of common observation,
and the obvious inference was that the breath, the vital soul, had left the body. Reflection
on this fact naturally led to the question, Whither has the soul gone?

+46+. Death of the soul. The general belief has always been that the soul survived the man's
death.[81] There are, however, exceptions; the continued existence of the soul was not an absolutely
established article in the savage creed. According to the reports of travelers, it would seem
that among some tribes there was disbelief or doubt on this point. A West African native expressed
his belief in the form of the general proposition, "The dead must die"; that is, apparently,
the dead man must submit to the universal law to which the living are subject.[82] In another
African community some held and others denied that a spirit could be killed, and one man was
certain that spirits lived long, but was not certain whether they ever died.[83] Differences
of opinion in regard to the fact of immortality are said to exist in Banks Islands.[84] The
Eskimos are reported as holding that the soul may be destroyed, and then, however, repaired.[85]

+47+. It thus appears that even among low tribes there is speculation on the question of the
continuance of existence after earthly death; there is admission of ignorance. We have, however,
examples of a definite belief in annihilation. In some cases, when the theory of several souls
is held,[86] one of these souls is supposed to become extinct at death: this is the case with
the Malagasy saina, and the 'beast-soul' among the Eẃe, Tshi, and Congoans; but such a soul
represents only a part of the man, and its disappearance does not signify the extinction of
the man's personality.

+48+. Complete extinction of the soul and the personality, in the case of certain persons,
is found among the Fijians: in the long and difficult way to the Underworld, bachelors (as
a rule), untattooed women, false boasters, and those men who failed to overcome in combat the
"slayer of souls" (the god Sama) are killed and eaten.[87] Something like this is reported
of the Hervey Islands,[88] New Zealand,[89] the Hawaiians,[90] and other tribes. Among the
wild tribes of India, the Khonds and the Oraons, or Dhangars, hold to annihilation of the soul
in certain cases.[91] Miss Kingsley reports a specially interesting view in Congo to the effect
that souls die when the family dies out.[92] The ground of this sense of the solidarity of
the living and the dead is not clear; the most obvious explanation is that the latter get their
sustenance from the offerings of the former, and perhaps from their prayers; such prayers,
according to W. Ellis,[93] are made in Polynesia. This belief appears also in some advanced
peoples: so the Egyptians,[94] and apparently the Hindus.[95]

+49+. In these cases no explanation is offered of how a soul can die. Earthly death is the
separation of the soul from the body, and by analogy the death of a soul should involve a disruption
of constituents, but the savage imagination appears to have passed lightly over this point:
when a soul is eaten, it is destroyed as the human body is destroyed when it is eaten; if it
is drowned or clubbed, it dies as a man does under similar treatment. The soul is conceived
of as an independent personality, with a corporeal form and mental powers; the psychic body,
it would seem, is endowed with power of thought.[96]

+50+. This vagueness of conception enables us to understand how savage logic reaches the conclusion
that the soul may be mortal: all the possibilities of the earthly person are transferred to
it. In regard to the occasion of its death, it is sometimes represented as punishment for violation
of tribal customs (as in Fiji), sometimes as the natural fate of inferior classes of persons
(as among the Tongans, who are said to believe that only chiefs live after death),[97] sometimes
as a simple destruction by human agency.

+51+. In the popular faith of the Semitic, Egyptian, Chinese, and Indo-European peoples there
is no sign of an extinction of the personality after earthly death. The Babylonian dead all
go to the vast and gloomy Underworld (Aralu), where their food is dust, and whence there is
no return.[98] The Old-Hebrew 'soul' (nephesh) continues to exist in Sheol. True, its life
is a colorless one, without achievement, without hope, and without religious worship; yet it
has the marks of personality.[99] The fortunes of the spirit (ruḥ), when it denotes not merely
a quality of character but an entity, are identical with those of the 'soul.'[100] In India,
belief in life after death has always been held by the masses, and philosophic systems conceive
of absorption, not of extinction proper. Zoroastrianism had, and has, a well-developed doctrine
of immortality, and the Egyptian conception of the future was equally elaborate. In China the
cult of ancestors does not admit belief in annihilation.[101] No theory of annihilation is
found in connection with the Greek and Latin 'soul' and 'spirit' (psyche, pneuma; animus, anima,
spiritus); the thymos is not a separate entity, but only an expression of the 'soul';[102]
and the Greek daimon and the Latin genius are too vague to come into consideration in this
connection.[103]

+52+. Omitting the purely philosophical views of the nature and destiny of the soul (absorption
into the Supreme God, or the Universal Force, is to be distinguished from annihilation), and
the belief of certain Christian sects in the future annihilation of the wicked (based probably
on a misunderstanding of certain Biblical passages[104]), it may be said that the rôle of the
theory of extinction of the soul in the general development of religion has been an insignificant
one. Beginning among the lowest tribes as an expression of belief in the universality of mortality,
it assumed a punitive character in the higher savage creed, and was gradually abandoned by
the religions of civilized peoples.

+53+. The belief in the continued existence of the soul, on the other hand, has maintained
itself from the earliest known times to the present. The inquiry into the grounds of this survival
belongs to the history of the doctrine of immortality, and will not be pursued here in detail.[105]
Doubtless it has been the increasing sense of the dignity of human nature, the conviction of
the close connection of human life with the divine, and the demand for a compensation for the
sufferings of the present (together with the instinctive desire for continued existence) that
has led men to retain faith in the continued life of the soul. Modern beliefs in ghosts and
in spiritualistic phenomena testify to the persistence of this article of faith.

+54+. Abode of the surviving soul.[106] Opinions regarding the destiny of the surviving soul
have changed from time to time in accordance with topographical conditions and with changes
in intellectual and moral culture. There is no place or thing on or under or above the ground
that has not been regarded, at some time and by some communities, as its abode. The selection
of the particular thing or place has been determined by local conditions--by what was supposed
to be observation of facts, or by what was conceived to be appropriate. The obscurity of the
subject has allowed free play to savage imagination. The paucity of data makes it impossible
to give a complete statement of the views that have been held, or to arrange such as are known
in accurate chronological order; but the principal opinions may be mentioned, following in
a general way the order of refinement.[107]

+55+. 1. One of the earliest (and also one of the most persistent) views of the future of souls
is that they are reborn or reincarnated as human beings, or as beasts or plants or inanimate
things. It was not unnatural that, when a new human being came into the world, it should be
regarded as the reproduction of a former human being, especially if the physiological conditions
of birth were not understood;[108] the basis of the belief may have been the general similarity
between human forms, and, in some cases, the special similarity between the infant or the adult
and some deceased person. An extension of the sphere of reincarnation would also naturally
arise from the recognized kinship between man and other things, animate or inanimate.

+56+. Examples of these views are found in many parts of the world. Tylor[109] and Marillier[110]
have collected instances of such beliefs among savage tribes in the Americas, Africa, Asia,
and Oceania, as well as in higher religions (Brahmanism, Buddhism, Plato, Mani, the Jewish
Kabbala, Swedenborg).[111] Other instances of belief in rebirth in human beings or in animals
are found among the ancient Germans,[112] the people of Calabar,[113] the Torres Straits islanders,[114]
the Central Australians,[115] and the Yorubans.[116]

+57+. There is an obvious relation between the belief in reincarnation in animal form and the
worship of animals;[117] both rest on the assumption of substantial identity of nature between
man and other beings, an assumption which seems to be universal in early stages of culture,
and is not without support in modern philosophic thought.[118] Ancient belief included gods
in this circle of kinship--a view that appears in Brahmanism and the later Buddhism.

+58+. The higher forms of the theory introduced a moral element into the process of reincarnation--the
soul ascends or descends in the scale of being according to the moral character or illumination
of its life on earth.[119] Thus it is given a practical bearing on everyday life--a result
that is in accordance with all religious history, in which we find that religious faith always
appropriates and utilizes the ethical ideas of its time.

+59+. At the present day the interest in the hypothesis of reincarnation springs from its supposed
connection with the doctrine of immortality. Brahmanists and Buddhists maintain that it is
the only sure basis for this doctrine; but this view appears not to have met with wide acceptance.

+60+. 2. An all but universal belief among lower tribes is that departed souls remain near
their earthly abodes, haunting the neighborhood of the body or the grave or the village.[120]
It is apparently assumed that a soul is more at home in places which it knew in its previous
life, and this assumption is confirmed by sights and sounds, chiefly during the night, that
are interpreted as the forms and utterances of wandering souls.

+61+. Generally no occupation is assigned to these ghosts, except that it is sometimes supposed
that they seek food and warmth:[121] scraps of food are left on the ground for them, and persons
sitting around a fire at night are afraid to venture into the dark places beyond lest they
meet them.[122] For it is a common belief that such souls are dangerous, having both the power
and the will to inflict injury.[123] It is easy to see why they should be supposed to possess
extraordinary powers.[124] The belief in their maliciousness may have come naturally from the
social conditions of the place and time: in savage communities a man who is stronger than his
fellows is likely to treat them as his savage instincts prompt, to seize their property or
kill them; and departed souls would naturally be credited with similar dispositions.

+62+. It is also true that the mysterious is often dreadful; even now in civilized lands there
is a general fear of a 'ghost.' Precautions are taken by savages to drive or keep the soul
away: the doors of houses are closed, and noises are made. On the other hand, ghosts, as members
of the family or the clan, are often regarded as friendly.[125] Even during a man's lifetime
his soul may be a sort of guide and protector--may attain, in fact, the rank of a deity;[126]
and after death it may become, as ancestor, the object of a regular cult.

+63+. Fear of ghosts has, perhaps, suggested certain methods of disposing of the dead body,
as by interring or exposing it at a distance from the village, or burning it or throwing it
into the water; other considerations, however, as is suggested above,[127] may determine, in
whole or in part, these methods of dealing with the body.

+64+. 3. It may be considered an advance in the organization of the future life when the soul
is supposed to go to some distant place on the earth or in the sea or in the sky.[128] This
is an attempt to separate the spheres of the living and the dead, and thus at once to define
the functions of the dead and relieve the living from the fear of them. The land of the dead
is sometimes vaguely spoken of as lying on earth, far off in some direction not precisely defined--east,
west, north, or south--in accordance with traditions whose origin is lost in the obscurity
of the past.

+65+. Possibly in some cases it is the traditional original home of the tribe;[129] more often,
it would seem, some local or astronomical fact has given the suggestion of the place; one Egyptian
view was that the western desert (a wide mysterious region) was the abode of the departed;
it was a widespread belief that the dead went to where the sun disappeared beneath the horizon.[130]
Tribes living near the sea or a river often place the other world beyond the sea or the river,[131]
and a ferryman is sometimes imagined who sets souls over the water.[132] Mountains also are
regarded as abodes of the dead.[133] It is not unnatural that the abodes of departed souls
should be placed in the sky, whose height and brightness, with its crowd of luminous bodies,
made it an object of wonder and awe, and caused it to be regarded as the dwelling place of
the happy gods, with whom deserving men would naturally be. Sometimes the expanse of the upper
air was regarded as the home of souls (as in Samoa), sometimes a heavenly body--the sun (in
India), or the moon (in the Bowditch Islands), or the stars.[134] The schemes being vague,
several of these conceptions may exist side by side at the same place and time.

+66+. The occupations of the dead in these regions are held usually to be the same as those
of the living; no other view is possible in early stages of social life. Generally all the
apparatus of earthly life (food, utensils, weapons) is placed on the grave or with the body,
and wives and slaves are slain to be the companions of the deceased.

+67+. 4. A more decided separation between the living and the dead is made in the conception
of the underground world as the abode of the latter. It was, however, only at a late period
that this conception was carried far enough to make the separation effective. Among the Central
Australians there were folk-stories of early men who traveled under the ground, but this is
represented as merely an extraordinary way of getting from one place to another on the surface
of the earth. Some North American tribes tell of an underground world inhabited by the ants
and by beings similar to man, but those who live up on the earth are seen there only by accident,
as when some hero dares the descent.[135] The conception of a real subterranean or submarine
hades is found, however, among many savage and barbarous peoples, as the Samoans, the inhabitants
of New Guinea, the Zulus, the Navahos, the Eskimo, the Kafirs of the Hindu Kush, and others.[136]

+68+. These pictures of the future world are crude, and usually stand side by side with others;
they are experiments in eschatology. But the constructive imagination moved more and more toward
an organized underground hades as the sole abode of the dead--the place to which all the dead
go. Such a hades is found among the civilized peoples of antiquity, Egyptians, Semites, Hindus,
Greeks, and Romans, and, in more recent times, among the Teutons (Scandinavians). The suggestion
for this position may have come from the grave (though it does not appear that the grave was
regarded as the permanent abode of the dead), and from caverns that seemed to lead down into
the bowels of the earth. The descent of souls into a subterranean world offered no difficulties
to early imagination: ghosts, like the Australian ancestors, could move freely where living
men could not go; where there was no cavern like that by which Æneas passed below,[137] they
could pass through the ground.

+69+. A lower region offered a wide land for the departed, with the possibility of organization
of its denizens. Ghosts gradually lost their importance as a factor in everyday life; sights
and sounds that had been referred to wandering souls came to be explained by natural laws.
Wider geographical knowledge made it difficult to assign the ghosts a mundane home, and led
to their relegation to the sub-mundane region. Further, the establishment of great nations
familiarized men with the idea that every large community should have its own domain. The gods
were gradually massed, first in the sky, the ocean, and hades, and then in heaven. For the
dead the first organization (if that term may be allowed) was in hades; the separation into
heaven and hell came later. A specific divine head of the Underworld is found in Egypt, Babylonia
and Assyria, India, Greece, Rome, but not in Israel. Such a definite system of government could
exist only when something approaching a pantheon had been established; the Babylonians, for
example, whose pantheon was vague, had also a vague god of hades.

+70+. Theories of the occupations of the dead varied in the early civilized stage, before the
rise of the idea of ethical retribution in the other life. In the absence of earthly relations,
imagination could conceive of nothing for them to do, and hence an ardent desire for the continuance
of earthly life.[138] For the Hebrews the Underworld was without pursuits; the shades sat motionless,
in the dress and according to the rank of the upper world, without emotions or aims (except
a sparkle of malicious satisfaction when some great man came down from earth), and without
religious worship.[139] A similar view was held by the Greeks and the Romans. Certain Egyptian
documents speak of mundane occupations for the dead, but these documents belong to a comparatively
late stage of culture, and what the earlier view was we do not know.[140] Of Hindu ideas, also,
on this point we have only relatively late notices.

+71+. 5. A radical transformation in the conception of the state of the dead was effected by
the introduction of the idea of moral retribution into the life of the Underworld.[141] The
basis of the movement was the natural conception of life as determined by ethical considerations,
but the process of transformation has extended over thousands of years and has hardly yet reached
its completion. In the lowest eschatological systems known to us there is no marked difference
in the status of departed souls; so among the Central Australians, the tribes of New Guinea
and the Torres Straits islands, the Zulus, the Malagasy, the West African peoples, and some
North American tribes.[142]

+72+. The earliest grounds of distinction are ritualistic and social; these occur among the
higher savages and survive in some civilized peoples. The Fijians assign punishment in the
other world to bachelors, men unaccompanied by their wives and children, cowards, and untattooed
women.[143] Where circumcision was a tribal mark, the uncircumcised, as having no social status,
were consigned to inferior places in hades: so among the Hebrews.[144] The omission of proper
funeral ceremonies was held in like manner to entail deprivation of privilege in hades: the
shade had an undesirable place below, as among the Babylonians and the Hebrews,[145] or was
unable to enter the abode of the dead, and wandered forlorn on the earth or on the border of
the Underworld, as was the Greek belief.[146] Exposure of the corpse to beasts and birds, making
funeral ceremonies impossible, was regarded as a terrible misfortune for the dead.[147]

+73+. Such of these beliefs as relate to violations of ritual appear to spring from the view
that the tribal customs are sacred, and from the consequent distinction between tribesmen and
foreigners. All persons without the tribal mark were shut out from the privileges of the tribe,
were outlaws in this world and the next; and those whose bodies were not properly disposed
of lost the support of the tribal deities or of the subterranean Powers.[148] It was also held
that the body retained the form in which it went down to hades;[149] hence the widespread dread
of mutilation, as among the Chinese still. On the other hand the brave were rewarded.[150]

+74+. Sometimes earthly rank determines future conditions--a natural corollary to what is stated
above (§72 f.). A distinction is made between nobles and common people in the Bowditch Islands.[151]
The members of the Fijian Areoi Society are held to enjoy special privileges in the other world.[152]
The belief in the Marquesas Islands is that the sky is for high gods and nobles.[153] According
to John Smith, in savage Virginia only nobles and priests were supposed to survive after death.[154]
The North American Mandans (of Dakota), according to one view, assign to the brave in the hereafter
the delightful villages of the gods.[155] When souls are supposed to enter into animals different
animals are assigned to nobles and common men.[156] Kings and nobles retain their superiority
of position and are sometimes attended by their slaves and officers.[157]

+75+. The manner of death is sometimes significant. The Karens hold that persons killed by
elephants, famine, or sword, do not enter the abode of the dead, but wander on the earth and
take possession of the souls of men.[158] In Borneo it is supposed that those who are killed
in war become specters.[159] The belief in the Marquesas Islands is that warriors dying in
battle, women dying in childbirth, and suicides go up to the sky.[160] In regard to certain
modes of death opposite opinions are held in the Ladrone (Marianne) Islands and the Hervey
group: in the former those who die by violence are supposed to be tortured by demons, those
who die a natural death are believed to be happy; according to the view in the latter group
these last are devoured by the goddess of death, and the others are happy. In the one case
violent death, it would seem, is supposed to be due to the anger of the gods, and to be a sign
of something bad in the man; in the other case happiness is compensation for the misfortune
of a violent death, and natural death, being the fate of ordinary people, leaves one at the
mercy of the mistress of the other world.

+76+. The advance to the conception of moral retribution hereafter could take place only in
communities in which earthly life was organized on a moral basis. The beginning of the movement
is seen in certain savage tribes. Savages have their codes, which generally recognize some
ethical virtues among the tribal obligations. Stealing, lying, failure in hospitality, cowardice,
violation of marital rights--in general, all the acts that affect injuriously the communal
life--are, as a rule, condemned by the common sense of the lowest peoples, and the moral character
of the gods reflects that of their worshipers. By reason of the sense of solidarity the faults
of individuals affect not only themselves but also their communities, and the gods care for
communities as well as for individuals. Whenever, then, there is an inquest in the other world,
these faults, it is likely, will be punished. On account of the paucity of our information,
it is not possible to make a general statement on this point, but examples of future moral
control occur in many savage creeds.[161] In such systems the nature of the life beyond the
grave is variously conceived: sometimes as cheerless and gloomy (as in Finland), sometimes
as pleasant (as in Samoa, New Guinea, New Caledonia, Bowditch Islands, some North American
tribes, Brazil).[162]

+77+. In tracing the growth of the conception of distinctions in the other world,[163] we find
first a vague opinion that those who do badly in this life are left to shift for themselves
hereafter;[164] that is, there is no authority controlling the lives of men below. In the majority
of cases, however, distinctions are made, but these, as is remarked above, are based on various
nonmoral considerations, and have small cultural value.[165]

+78+. In the published reports of savage beliefs there is not always mention of a formal examination
of the character of the dead, and probably nothing of the sort was imagined by the lowest tribes.
It appears, however, in such relatively advanced peoples as the Fijians[166] and the Khonds.[167]

+79+. Moral retribution proper is found only in great civilized nations and not in all of them;
the early Semites appear to have retained the old conception of punishment for ritual faults
or failures, and for offenses against the national welfare. For the Hebrews the proof is found
in the Old Testament passim; in the Babylonian and Assyrian literature, as far as published,
there is one sign of departure from the scheme sketched in the Descent of Ishtar: Hammurabi
(ca. 2000 B.C.) invokes the curses of the gods on any one who shall destroy the tablet of his
penal code, and wishes that such a one may be deprived of pure water after death. In regard
to the South Arabians, the pre-Mohammedan North Arabians, and the Aramæans, we have no information;
and for the Phoenicians there is only the suggestion involved in the curse invoked on those
who violate a tomb, and in the funeral ceremonies.[168] But the same general religious ideas
prevailed throughout the ancient Semitic area, and we may probably assume that the Hebrew conception
was the universal one.

+80+. In Egypt, India, China, Persia, Greece, Rome, however, and among the Jews in the Greek
period,[169] higher ethical conceptions were carried over to the Underworld; judgment, it was
held, was pronounced on the dead, and rewards and punishments dealt out to them according to
their moral character. The Jews and the Persians went a step further, and conceived of a final
general judgment, a final winding-up of human history, and a permanent reconstruction of the
world on a basis largely moral, though tinged with local religious elements--a grandiose idea
that has maintained itself up to the present time, embodying the conviction that the outcome
of life depends on character, and that ethical retribution is the essence of the world.

+81+. This ethical constitution of the life hereafter led to the local separation of the good
from the bad. Such a separation was imagined by comparatively undeveloped peoples whose ethical
principle was chiefly ritualistic, as, for example, the Fijians, the American Indians, and
by civilized peoples in their early stages, the Vedic Hindus[170] (Yama's abode in the sky,
and a pit) and the Greeks (the Homeric Elysian Fields, and Tartarus).[171]

+82+. In fact, a recognition of a place of happiness and a place of punishment in the other
life accompanies sooner or later a certain stage of ethical culture in all communities. In
India it appears in the late Vedic and post-Vedic periods, together with the ethical doctrine
of metempsychosis, and though, as is natural in such a stage of development, various ideas
are held respecting the destinies of the good and the bad, the ethical distinction between
these classes of persons, with a systematic awarding of rewards and punishments, becomes firmly
established: Yama becomes an ethical judge. In the Brahmanas, Manu, and the Mahabharata, we
find a sort of heaven for the virtuous and a hell for the vicious. While the academic thought
of Brahmanism and the altruistic systems of Jainism and Buddhism looked to the absorption of
the departed into the All, the popular Hindu faith held fast to the scheme of happiness and
wretchedness in the future.[172] As in Dante's Divina Commedia, the heaven was somewhat colorless,
the hell more distinct and picturesque; pain is acute and varied, happiness is calm and uniform.

+83+. The later Egyptian eschatological development was not unlike the later Hindu. The good
were rewarded with delightful habitations in the West or with the Sun; the bad were tortured
in a gloomy place.[173]

+84+. As regards the early Greek eschatological scheme, it is suggested by S. Reinach[174]
that the descriptions of punishments in Tartarus (as in the cases of Tantalus and others) arose
from misunderstood representations of the condition of the dead in the other world, they being
represented either as engaged in the occupations of this life, or as they were at the moment
of death. The great punishments, in fact, are assigned only to heroic mythical offenders, but
there seems to be no reason why the idea of retribution should not be supposed to enter into
such descriptions. Separation of the good from the bad on ethical grounds appears in Greece
in the time of Plato. In various passages he describes the savage places (Tartarus and others)
to which criminals go after death, and the happy abodes of the virtuous.[175] These abodes
were not with the gods; the occasional translations to heaven (Heracles, Ganymede) are exceptional
honors paid to heroes and favorites.

+85+. The Jewish conception of a punitive future belongs to the Greek period of Jewish history,
and was probably developed on Hebrew lines under Greek and Egyptian influence. A combination
of the Old Testament view of future retribution on earth with the conception of torture in
the other world is given in Enoch.[176] In some circles Sheol was placed in the West and divided
into two regions, one of happiness, the other of punishment,[177] or the good dwell with the
angels in heaven, the bad in hell.[178] By others the abodes of the dead were placed in the
heavenly regions: of the seven heavens, the second was assigned to the bad and the third to
the good.[179] With all the variation of locality, the separation of the bad from the good
is made permanent, and this distinction is maintained in the New Testament, which throughout
assigns the wicked to hell (Gehenna or Tartarus), while the righteous dwell sometimes on the
renovated earth, sometimes in the heavenly regions.[180]

+86+. The Jewish and Christian books mentioned above content themselves with the general statement
that the punishment of the wicked will be torture by fire and cold. Succeeding Christian books
elaborated the picture of torture with great ingenuity; the Apocalypse of Peter, following
and expanding the description of Plato and Enoch, has an elaborate barbarous apparatus of punishment,
and this scheme, continued through a series of works,[181] has its culmination in Dante's Inferno,
where, however, the ethical element is pronounced, though colored by the poet's likes and dislikes.

+87+. Purgatory. The wicked dead were not always left hopeless in their place of punishment.
Kindly human feeling (shown in early stages by pious care for the well-being of the dead) and
the analogy of earthly procedures, civil and religious, led to the view that, after the expiation
of faults by suffering, the evildoer might be freed from his prison and gain a place of happiness.
Pardon and purification were effected on earth by punishments (scourging, imprisonment, etc.)
or by ritual processes (ablution, fastings, etc.)--why not in the other life? In some systems
of transmigration the man, forced after death to assume a lower form, may rise by good conduct
to a higher form. In Plato's imaginative construction of the Underworld[182] those who have
lived neither well nor ill are purified in the Acherusian lake and then receive rewards according
to their deserts; and those who have committed great but not unpardonable crimes may come to
the lake (after having suffered the pains of Tartarus) and be freed from trouble if they obtain
pardon from those they have wronged. But as here, so hereafter, certain offenses were regarded
as unpardonable. The purgatorial conception passed into patristic and Roman and Eastern Christianity
and Talmudic and Medieval Judaism.[183]

+88+. Resurrection. The doctrine of the resurrection of the dead, which has been fully developed
only by the Persians and the Jews (and from them taken by Christianity and Islam), appears
to have grown from simple beginnings. It is the expression of the conviction that the perfect
man is made up of soul and body, and its full form is found only in periods of high ethical
culture. But in very early times the belief in the intimate connection between body and soul
appears in the care taken among certain peoples to preserve the bones or the whole body of
the deceased as a possible future abode for the soul;[184] and, on the other hand, as the soul,
it was held, might return to the body and be dangerous to the living, means were sometimes
employed to frighten it off. It seems to have been believed in some cases that the destruction
of the body involved the destruction of the soul (New Zealand). An actual entrance of a departed
soul into a human body is involved in some early forms of the doctrine of reincarnation,[185]
but this is not the restoration of the dead man's own body. It was held in Egypt (and not improbably
elsewhere) that the soul after death might desire to take possession of its own body, and provision
was made for such an emergency; but this belief seems not to have had serious results for religious
life. A temporary reunion of soul and body appears in the figure of the vampire, which, however,
is a part of a popular belief and religiously not important. But these passing beliefs indicate
a general tendency, and may have paved the way for the more definite conception of bodily restoration.

+89+. The more developed Hindu doctrine (Brahmanic, Jainistic, Buddhistic) recognized a great
variety of possible forms of reincarnation (human and nonhuman), and made a step forward by
including the continuity or reëstablishment of moral life and responsibility (the doctrine
of karma).[186] It, however, never reached the form of a universal or partial resurrection.

+90+. The birthplace of this latter doctrine appears to have been the region in which Mazdaism
arose, the country south of the Caspian Sea. Windischmann infers from Herodotus, iii, 62, that
it appears as a Mazdean belief as early as the sixth century B.C.[187] This is doubtful, but
it is reported as a current belief by Theopompus.[188] Its starting-point was doubtless the
theory of reincarnation, which, we may suppose, the Iranian Aryans shared with their Indian
brethren. Precisely what determined the Iranian movement toward this specific form of reincarnation
we have no means of knowing. It may be due to the same genius for simple organization that
led the Zoroastrians to discard the mass of the old gods and elevate Ahura Mazda to the chief
place in the pantheon; their genius for practical social religious organization may have induced
them to select human reincarnation as the most natural and the most effective morally, and
to discard other forms as unworthy.[189] The dead man's own body would then be the natural
dwelling place of his soul; but a refined body (as in 1 Cor. xv) might be regarded as better
suited to the finer life of the future. Whatever the cause, they adopted this conception, and
probably through their influence it passed to, or was formulated by, the Jews, among whom it
appears in the second century B.C. (in the Book of Daniel).[190] In Daniel and 2 Maccabees
resurrection is confined to the Jews; in Enoch it is sometimes similarly confined, sometimes
apparently universal.[191] In the New Testament also the same diversity of statement appears;
resurrection seems to be confined to believers in some passages[192] and to be universal in
others.[193] In the former case it is regarded as a reward of piety and as a consequence of
the intimate relation between the man and God or Christ; unbelievers then remain in hades,
where they are punished. But universal resurrection was probably thought of as involved in
the grandiose conceptions of a final judgment and a final moral restoration.[194]

5. POWERS OF THE SOUL

+91+. Savage lore takes account of the powers of the separated soul only; the qualities and
functions of the earthly incorporate soul are accepted as a part of the existing familiar order,
and are not analyzed or discussed. It was different with the departed soul, which, because
of its strangeness and mystery, was credited with extraordinary powers, and this part of savage
science was gradually developed, through observation and inference, into an important system.
In the search for causes, the Shade, its independent existence once established, came to be
regarded as the agent in many procedures of which no probable account could otherwise be given.

+92+. The greatest activity of the departed soul is found in the earliest known period of culture,
when it was not yet relegated to hades or to the sky, but dwelt on earth, either near its former
habitation or in a distant region from which it might return. Its powers of movement and action
are then held to be all that imagination can suggest. Such souls move through the air or under
the ground, enter houses through obstacles impenetrable to the earthly man, pass into the human
body, assume such shapes as pleases them. Divested of gross earthly bodies, they are regarded
as raised above all ordinary limitations of humanity. Of these conceptions, that of the ghost's
superhuman power of movement remains in the popular faith to the present day.

+93+. The practical question for the early man is the determination of the relation of departed
souls to earthly life. Among savage tribes their attitude is sometimes friendly, sometimes
unfriendly, more often the latter.[195] To fear the unknown is a human instinct. Shades are
looked on as aliens, and aliens are generally enemies. In particular, ghosts are conceived
of as sometimes wandering about in search of food or warmth, or as cherishing enmity toward
persons who had wronged them in their earthly life. They are supposed to be capable of inflicting
disease or pain, and precautions are taken against them. Cases are reported of persons who
killed themselves in order that, as ghosts, they might wreak vengeance on enemies.[196] On
the other hand, to the members of its own family the departed soul is sometimes held to be
friendly, or not unfriendly, but among savages it is not thought of as a potent and valuable
friend.

+94+. In the more advanced cults the functions of the departed souls become larger and more
important. They are regarded as having the power of foretelling the future, and are consulted.[197]
They become guardian spirits, and a cult of souls arises.[198] In some higher forms of religion
(Judaism, Christianity, Islam) they are regarded as mediators between man and the deity, or
as advocates for man in the heavenly court.

+95+. Prayer for the dead. Before the ethical stage of religion the moral condition and needs
of the dead did not come into consideration; their physical wants were met by performance of
funeral rites and by supplying them with food and other necessities of life,[199] and they
later came to be looked on as helpers rather than as needing help; but when this old view passed
away, and the conceptions of judgment and ethical retribution after death were reached, the
moral status of the dead became a source of anxiety to the living. It was held that the divine
judge might be reached--by intercession or by petitions, or by the performance of certain ceremonies--and
his attitude toward the dead modified.

+96+. A trace of such care for the deceased may be found in the Brahmanic ceremonies intended
to secure complete immortality to fathers.[200] In Egypt, in the later times, there was an
arrangement for securing for the deceased immunity from punishment for moral offenses: a sacred
beetle of stone, inscribed with a charm beginning "O my heart, rise not up against me as a
witness," laid on the breast of the mummy, silences the heart in the presence of Osiris, and
the man, even though guilty, goes free. Forms of charms were prepared by the priests, and the
name of any one who could pay was inserted in blanks left for this purpose.[201] This sort
of corrupting procedure was reproduced in some periods of Christianity. In the early Church
a custom existed of receiving baptism on behalf of such as died unbaptized;[202] here, apparently,
a magical efficacy was ascribed to the act. The first mention of prayer for the dead occurs
in a history of the Maccabean wars, where a sin-offering, accompanied by prayer, effects reconciliation
for certain soldiers who died in a state of sin (idol symbols were found on their persons).[203]
Prayer for the dead has been largely developed in Christianity and Islam.[204]

6. GENESIS OF SPIRITS

+97+. As early science identified life with the soul, it logically attributed a soul to everything
that was regarded as living. This category seems to have embraced all the objects of the world--human
beings, beasts, plants, weapons, rocks, waters, heavenly bodies. Savages rarely formulate their
ideas on such a subject, but the belief in the future existence of nonhuman as well as human
things is fairly established by the widespread practice of slaying animals at the tomb and
burying with the dead the objects they are supposed to need in the other world. This custom
exists among many tribes at the present day, and the contents of ancient tombs prove its existence
in former times. The dead are provided with clothing, implements of labor, weapons, ornaments,
food, and as these objects remain in their mundane form by or in the grave, it is held that
their souls pass with the souls of their possessors into the world beyond. Further, the belief
in transformation from human to nonhuman forms and vice versa involves the supposition of life
in all such things. That the heavenly bodies, similarly, are supposed to be animated by souls
appears from the fact that they are regarded as manlike in form, thought, and manner of life:
the sun is frequently represented as a venerable man who traverses the sky--the moon being
his wife, and the stars their children; and sun and moon sometimes figure as totems. This general
conception has been expanded and modified in a great variety of ways among different peoples,
but the belief in the anthropomorphic nature of the astral bodies has been an element of all
religions except the highest.

+98+. The apparent incongruities in the savage theory--that all things are endowed with life--need
occasion us no difficulty. Complete consistency and tenability in such theories is not to be
expected. Early men, like the lower animals, were doubtless capable of distinguishing between
things living and things dead: a dog quickly discovers whether a moving object is alive. Man
and beasts have in such questions canons of criticism derived from long experience.[205]

+99+. But man differs from the beast in that he feels the necessity of accounting for life
by the hypothesis of a soul, and as he seems to himself to find evidence of life in plants
and minerals (movement, growth, decay), he is justified in attributing souls to all things.
He is interested, however, only in movements that affect his welfare. Whatever his general
theory about rocks, a particular rock, as long as it does not affect his life, is for him an
inert and worthless mass, practically dead; but if he discovers that it has power to harm him,
it becomes instinct with life, and is treated as a rational being. Man has shown himself practical
in all stages of religion; he is always the center of his world, and treats objects and theories
with sole regard to his own well-being.

+100+. The world of the savage was thus peopled with souls, and these came to have an independent
existence. That this was the case with human souls is pointed out above,[206] and by analogy
the separateness was extended to all souls. Thus there arose tree-spirits, river-spirits, and
other similar extrahuman beings. It is convenient to employ the term 'spirit' as the designation
of the soul in a nonhuman object, isolated and independent, and regarded as a Power to be treated
with respect. The term is sometimes used of a disembodied human soul, and sometimes of a deity
resident in an object of nature. It is better to distinguish, as far as possible, between these
different senses of the word. The functions of a spirit are sometimes practically identical
with those of a god. The difference between these two classes of extrahuman agents is one of
general culture; it is especially determined in any community by the extent of the organization
of such agents that has been effected by the community. The cult of spirits is considered below
in connection with the description of divine beings.[207]

CHAPTER III

EARLY RELIGIOUS CEREMONIES

+101+. The earliest known forms of social life are characterized by the performance of public
ceremonies, which are almost always religious. Religion in some form enters into all the details
of early life--there is no event that is not supposed to be caused or affected by a supernatural
Power or influence. A vaguely conceived force (mana), an attribute of life, is believed to
reside in all things, and under certain circumstances has to be reckoned with. Mysterious potencies
in the shape of souls, spirits, gods, or mana are held to preside over and control all affairs--birth,
sickness, death, hate and love, hunting and war, sowing and reaping. There is no dogma except
belief in this extrahuman influence--no conception of moral effort as based on and sanctioned
by a definite moral ideal, no struggle of the sort that we call spiritual. Religion consists
of a body of practices whose authority rests on precedent; as it is supposed they have existed
from time immemorial, they are held to be necessary to secure the well-being of the tribe (a
sufficient supply of food, or victory over enemies); to the question why such and such things
are done, the common reply of the savage is that without them the thing desired could not be got.

+102+. In the earliest stages known to us these procedures are already elaborate and distinct;
they are generally conducted by the tribal leaders (old men, chiefs, magicians), by whom they
are handed down from generation to generation.[208] Their precise origin is lost in the depths
of antiquity. Doubtless they arose from social needs, and their precise forms were suggested
by crude observation and reasoning. Reflection on processes of nature, guided sometimes by
fortunate or unfortunate accidents, may have led to the establishment of methods of procedure
for gaining social and individual ends; and, as at this formative period the whole life of
the community was permeated by religious conceptions, the procedures either were originally
religious or speedily took on a religious coloring.

+103+. Two characteristics belong to early ceremonies: they are communal, and they are generally
sacred mysteries. Whatever be the origin of the tribal and clan institutions of society, these
are practically universal in the world as it is now known. Even in the few cases where men
live in the comparative isolation of individual family groups (as the Eskimo, Fuegians, and
others are said to do[209]), there is a communal feeling that is shown in the identity of customs
and ideas among the isolated groups. In early man there is little individuality of thought
or of religious experience,[210] and there is no observable difference between public and private
religious worship. Ceremonies, like language, are the product of social thought, and are themselves
essentially social. When a man performs an individual religious act (as when he recognizes
an omen in an animal or bird, or chooses a guardian animal or spirit, or wards off a sickness
or a noxious influence), he is aware that his act is in accordance with general usage, that
it has the approval of the community, and that its potency rests on the authority of the community.
It is true that such communal character belongs, in some degree, to all religious life--no
person's religion is wholly independent of the thought of his community; but in the lower strata
the acceptance of the common customs is unreflective and complete. When definite individualism
sets in, ceremonies begin to lose their old significance, though they may be retained as mere
forms or with a new interpretation.

+104+. That the ceremonial observances are usually sacred is obvious from all the descriptions
we have of them. Their power is not always attributed to the action of external personal, supernatural
agencies (though such agencies may have been assumed originally); in many cases, it is held
to reside in themselves.[211] They are sacred in the sense that they are mysterious, acting
in a way that is beyond human comprehension and with a power that is beyond human control.[212]
They are efficacious only when performed by persons designated or recognized by the community.
Here there is undoubtedly a dim sense of law and unity in the world, based on an interpretation
of experiences. This is a mode of thought that runs through the whole history of religion--only,
in the earliest stages of human life, it is superficial and narrow. The earlier ceremonial
customs contain the germs and the essential features of the later more refined procedures.

+105+. Without attempting to give an exhaustive list, the principal early ceremonies may be
divided into classes as follows:

EMOTIONAL AND DRAMATIC CEREMONIES

+106+. The dances that are so common among savage tribes are in many instances now (and doubtless
this has always been the case) simply the expression of animal joyousness.[213] They are like
the caperings of young animals--only, the human feeling of rhythm asserts itself, the movements
are often measured and graceful. There is naturally an accompaniment of noise--shouting and
beating on pieces of wood, bone, or metal, with songs or chants, the beginnings of vocal and
instrumental music.

Words and melodies are simple and rude; they are the productions of individual singers, often,
of course, made from a stock of material common to all members of the clan or the tribe. In
Australia songs are thought to be obtained by bards during sleep from the souls of the dead
(sometimes from Bunjil), or the bard is possessed by the soul of a beast; chants are employed
in magical ceremonies, and there are lullabies and other children's songs.[214] The Muscogee
"Song of the Sabbea" is very sacred.[215] In West Africa minstrels recite song-stories, every
story being attached to an object (bone, feather, etc.).[216] Songs are chanted at festivals
in Guiana (and at night men tell endless stories).[217]

+107+. The movements of the dance are sometimes in imitation of those of animals,[218] sometimes
spontaneous, and sometimes from our point of view indecent. The indecency and obscenity originated
and has continued in a period when no moral element entered into such performances--they simply
follow animal instincts and impulses, are controlled by them, and appear usually not to affect
the customs relating to marriage and chastity (so in the Areoi festivities of Tahiti, and among
the Central Australians[219]).

+108+. In accordance with the law by which religion appropriates social customs, the dance
is devoted to religious purposes and acquires a sacred character.[220] It is a common ceremony
as a preparation for war: the warriors of the tribe jump about with violent gesticulations
and shouts, brandishing weapons and mimicking the acts of attacking and slaying enemies.[221]
Here, doubtless, the object is partly to excite the men to fury and thus prepare them for combat,
but there is also the conviction that the ceremony itself has a sacred potency.[222] A similar
occult power is attached to dancing in Timorlaut, where, when a ship is at sea, the girls sing
and dance on the beach daily to bring the men back.[223] There are dances in commemoration
of the dead[224]--apparently a combination of affection and homage, with the general purpose
of conciliating the departed and procuring their aid; the belief being, apparently, that the
dead see these demonstrations and are pleased with them. A Ghost Dance formerly performed in
California had for its object bringing back the dead.[225]

+109+. At a later time such ceremonies were connected with the worship of gods: sometimes they
were of the nature of offerings of homage to the supernatural Powers, as in the Young Dog Dance;[226]
sometimes they took on a symbolic and representative or dramatic character. Among the Redmen
the dramatic dances are elaborate, often representing the histories of divine persons, these
latter frequently appearing in the form of animals.[227] The accompanying songs or chants relate
stories that are intended to explain, wholly or in part, the details of the rite.[228]

+110+. Thus combined with other ceremonies, dances become important means of religious culture.
In Greece dances were connected with many cults, among others with the Dionysiac ceremonies,
out of which grew the Greek drama. Among the Hebrews the ancient ceremonial dance appears as
late as the time of David,[229] though it was then, perhaps, falling into desuetude, since
his wife, Michal, is disgusted at his procedures. The violent movement of the dance excites
not only warlike rage but also religious ecstasy, and has been used abundantly for this purpose
by magicians, prophets, and mystics; the performer is regarded as a vehicle of divine revelation,
all abnormal excitement being ascribed to possession by a spirit.[230]

+111+. With dances may be classed processions, in which usually a god is invoked or praised.
In Ashantiland, in time of war, when the men are with the army, processions of women, wives
of the warriors, march through the streets, invoking the gods on behalf of the absent men.[231]
Often the performers bear a sacred object, as a stone (sometimes inclosed in a box[232]), a
boat, or an image; in early times such objects not only represent the gods but actually embody
them, or are themselves superhuman Powers.

+112+. A peculiar form of procession is that in which the worshipers move round a sacred object,
perhaps the adoption of a natural form of play. The original design in such movements may have
been simply to show respect to the object in question and secure its favor, the circular movement
being a natural way of keeping in touch with it. In certain cases the circumambulation is connected
with the movement of the sun in the sky--probably a later interpretation of the ceremony. Examples
are found in Hindu, Greek, and Roman practices, and in some modern Christian usages (in the
Greek and Roman churches). As a magical efficiency was held to attach to the ceremony, its
effect was sometimes held to depend on the direction of the movement; if it was to the right--passing
from east through south to west (the worshiper facing the east)--it was good, but bad if in
the opposite direction. Though traces of solemn circumambulation are found in some lower tribes,
it has been, and is, practiced chiefly in the higher cults.[233]

+113+. Sacred dances and processions are natural human expressions of emotions that have been
adopted by religious sentiment, and are often supposed to have potency in themselves. They
tend to disappear with the progress of general refinement and of ethical conceptions of life
and of deity. They continue, however, far into the civilized period, in which we find dramatic
representations (as the Eleusinian rites and the medieval Mystery Plays), processions of priests
bearing or conducting sacred objects, processions of devotees with music, and pilgrimages to
shrines. Such ceremonies, while they are regarded by educated persons simply as expressions
of reverence and accompaniments of prayer, are still believed by many to have an innate or
magic potency, insuring prosperity to the participants.

DECORATIVE AND CURATIVE CEREMONIES

+114+. Love of ornament is found among all savage peoples; the value they attach to beads and
all colored things is well known to travelers and traders. It has been plausibly argued that
the origin of clothing is to be found in the desire of each sex to make itself beautiful in
the eyes of the other.[234] However that may be, the employment of leaves for headdresses and
waistbands is general among lower tribes.[235]

+115+. Equally popular is the adornment of the body by colored marks made with red ocher, pipe-clay,
turmeric, charcoal, and such like things as are furnished by nature. Elaborate designs, of
straight and curved lines, are traced on the skin, and these are gradually differentiated and
become marks of rank and function. The war paint of the American Indians is governed by fixed
rules, the object being to make the warrior terrible to enemies.[236] Rings, quills, sticks,
and stones, worn in holes made in ears, nose, lips, and cheeks, are all originally decorative;
and so also prickings and gashes in the body, often in regular outlines.[237]

+116+. These latter, made according to tribal custom and law, become tribal marks (tattoo),
and are then essential to one's standing in the community. This custom is general in Polynesia
and in parts of North America.[238] The use of oil and other unguents early established itself
as a custom of savage society. They were probably useful in a variety of ways. For the hair
they made up for the absence of comb and brush; in combat they enabled the warrior to slip
from the grasp of his enemy; they defended the naked body from rain, and from soiling and injury
produced by contact with the earth and hard bodies; and in sickness they were regarded as curative.[239]
Oil was abundantly used as an article of food.

+117+. All these materials of decoration are transferred to the service of religion. The headdress
becomes a mask to represent an animal in a sacred ceremony,[240] or a priestly tiara. In such
ceremonies (especially in those of initiation) the painting of the body plays an important
part, the traceries varying according to the thing represented and the symbolism of the action.[241]
It is often difficult to see the precise significance of the paintings, but in certain cases
they are totemic marks, and represent whatever is sacred in totemic belief.[242]

+118+. It is possible to construe the development in two ways: the paintings may be regarded
as originally totemic or other clan marks, and as afterwards employed as ornaments, or the
order of movement may be taken to be in the reverse direction; but when we consider the primitive
character of decoration, the second suggestion seems the more probable. The same remark applies
to the practice of pricking, scarring, and tattooing.[243] For the body-markings blood is sometimes
employed, perhaps in part on account of its decorative color, but also probably with a religious
significance.[244]

+119+. Decoration has been and is largely employed in structures and dress connected with religious
life. Posts and beams of houses, totem posts and masts of vessels are covered with figures
in which artistic feeling is discernible;[245] and in late periods all the resources of art
are devoted to the form and adornments of temples, altars, and images. The designs are taken
from familiar objects, mostly from plants and animals. The ultimate motive is love of ornament,
which, while it finds abundant expression in ordinary social life, has its greatest development
in religion--a natural result of the fact that in a large part of human history religion has
been the chief organizing factor of society.

+120+. The tendency has been to make the dress of ministers of religion ornate.[246] This tendency
has arisen partly from love of ornament, and partly, doubtless, it is the transference of court
customs to religious ceremonial.[247]

+121+. Symbolism has entered largely into religious decoration. In very early times figures
of animals, plants, and human beings were used as records of current events, and were sometimes
supposed to have magical power, the picture being identified with the thing represented. In
a more advanced stage of culture the transition was easy to the conception of the figures as
representing ideas, but the older conception is often found alongside of the later--a symbolical
signification is attached to pictures of historical things. These then have a spiritual meaning
for higher minds, while for the masses they may be of the nature of fetishes.[248] In both
cases they may serve a good purpose in worship by fixing the mind on sacred things.

ECONOMIC CEREMONIES

+122+. The first necessity of savages is a sufficient supply of food, and this, they hold,
is to be procured either by the application of what they conceive to be natural laws, or by
appeal to superhuman Powers. Among economic ceremonies, therefore, we may distinguish those
which may be loosely described as natural, those in which a supernatural element enters, and
those in which the two orders of procedure appear to be combined.

+123+. Savages are generally skillful hunters. They know how to track game, to prepare nets
and pits, and to make destructive weapons. The African pygmies have poisoned arrows, with which
they are able to kill the largest animals.[249] The people of British New Guinea organize hunts
on a large scale.[250] In Australia, Polynesia, and America there is no tribe that is not able
to secure food by the use of natural means.

+124+. But such means are often supplemented by ceremonies that involve some sort of supernatural
influence. These ceremonies appear to assume a social relation between man and beasts and plants;
in some cases there is assumed a recognition by animals of the necessities of the case and
a spirit of friendly coöperation; in other cases a magical power is called into play.

+125+. Desire to propitiate the hunted animal, in order not only to avert the anger of its
kin but also to obtain its aid, appears in the numerous cases in which excuses are made for
the killing, and the animal is implored to make a friendly report of the man to its friends
and to return in order that it may be killed.[251] Formal prayer is sometimes made to the animal
in important tribal ceremonies, as in British Columbia a boy is ordered by the chief to pray
to the first salmon sighted for a good catch;[252] here the good will of the salmon tribe and
the quasi-human intelligence of the fish are assumed.

+126+. Precautions are taken to guard against antagonistic extrahuman influences; there are
taboos and rules of purification in preparation for hunting. In New Guinea hunters are required
to abstain from certain sorts of food and to perform purificatory ceremonies.[253] Among the
Nandi some men are forbidden to hunt, make traps, or dig pits for game;[254] these men, it
would seem, are supposed to be, for ceremonial reasons, antipathetic to the animals to be hunted,
as, on the other hand, there are men who attract game.[255] The taboos of food and other things
imposed are doubtless intended to guard against malefic spirits or mana. The particular rules
are determined by local conditions.

+127+. Certain rules about eating the food secured by hunting appear to have come from the
desire to act in an orderly manner and with due respect to the animal. When it is prescribed
that a bone shall not be broken this may be for fear of giving offense to the animal kin and
thus insuring failure in further hunting.[256] The provision that each man shall gather of
a fruit or vegetable only so much as will suffice for a single day may have had an economic
ground, the desire to avoid waste; or it may have been made also partly in the interest of
orderliness, and so have had originally no reference to any superhuman being.[257] Naturally
it was taken up into religion and given a religious sanction.

+128+. In Central Australia, where every clan is charged with the duty of procuring a particular
food (its totem) for the tribe, the custom is that when the product of hunting or gathering
is brought in to be thrown into the tribal store, the principal men of the hunting group begin
by eating a little of the food, after which the food is licit for the rest of the tribe but
illicit for the hunters.[258] This custom has been held to have a sacramental significance;
it has been suggested that the food is sanctified by the touch of the elders and thus made
lawful for the tribe, or that, as naturally sacred, it secures, when eaten, union between the
eater and a superhuman Power. But there is no hint of such a conception in the Australian ceremony
or elsewhere. The procedure is obligatory and solemn--to omit it would be, in the feeling of
the people, to imperil the life of the tribe; but all such usages are sanctified by time. We
should rather seek for the origin of the custom in some simple early idea. It is not unusual,
in parts of Australia and in other lands, that a man, though he may not eat his totem, may
kill it for others; the eating in this case is the important thing--there is magical power
in it--and the economic obligation to provide food overbears the sense of reverence for the
totem. The only obscure point in the ceremony under consideration is the obligation on the
killer or gatherer to taste the food before he gives it to his fellows. This may be a survival
of the rule, known to exist among some tribes, that in a hunting party he who kills an animal
has the first right to it. The Australian hunter cannot eat his totem, but he may hold to his
traditional right; the result will be the custom as it now exists. With our present knowledge
no quite satisfactory explanation of the origin of this particular rule can be given.

+129+. The employment of magical means for procuring food appears in the performance of ceremonial
dances, in the use of charms, the imitation of animals, and other procedures. In California
the supply of acorns and animals is supposed to be increased by dances.[259] The New Guinea
Koita give their hunting dogs decoctions of sago and other food into which are put pieces of
odoriferous bark;[260] these charms are said to have been got from the Papuans, the lowest
race of the region. A Pawnee folk-story (which doubtless reflects a current idea) tells how
a boy by his songs (that is, magic songs or charms) brought the buffalo within reach of his
people.[261] Among the Melanesians of New Guinea the hunting expert plays a great rôle--his
presence is necessary for the success of an expedition.[262] He fixes the date of the hunt,
prepares himself by a series of abstinences,[263] and at the appointed time assembles the men,
recites spells addressed to ancestors, and passing along the lines of the hunters imitates
the movements of the animal sought.[264]

+130+. Very elaborate ceremonies including imitations of animals (imitative or sympathetic
magic) are found in Central Australia.[265] When any animal is to be hunted the old men of
the appropriate totemic group, dressed to imitate the totem and accompanied by some of the
young men, repair to a spot regarded as sacred, and, along with other ceremonies, trace on
the sacred rock, with blood drawn from the young men, a picture of the animal, or figures representing
its growth--in general, something that sets forth its personality. These ceremonies, very numerous
and extending over a long space of time, constitute the main business of the elders, as, in
fact, the procuring of food is the chief concern of the people.

+131+. There is no perceptible religious element in these Australian ceremonies--no utterance
of charms or prayers, no mention of any supernatural being. The acts appear to be simply procedures
of imitative magic, customs sanctified by long usage. They relate to the life of the tribe;
this life, like all life, is mysterious and therefore sacred.[266] The belief in the potency
of the ceremonies appears to come from belief in the vital identity of the two groups, human
and nonhuman--the latter is supposed to respond, in some occult way, to the expression of kinship
involved in the official proceedings.

+132+. The employment of blood (considered as the locus of life) may indicate more definitely
a sense of the unity of life-force; the human blood is, perhaps, supposed to stimulate life
in the kindred animal group, and so to produce a large supply of individuals. In the published
accounts there is no hint that the blood is supposed to have atoning power. There is no sense
of wrongdoing or unworthiness on the part of the performers, or of any relation to a deity.
The theology of Central Australia is still obscure--the general religious situation in that
region has much that is enigmatical.

+133+. A more advanced ritual occurs among certain agricultural tribes, among whom is found
a more elaborate use of blood and a definite recognition of superhuman beings. In these communities
it is regarded as necessary to profitable tilling to fertilize the soil with the blood of a
slain victim, sometimes human (as among the Khonds of Orissa, the Pawnees, and others[267]),
sometimes bestial (as in Southern India[268]); parts of the victim's flesh are buried, or blood
is sprinkled on the seed, and homage is paid to a sacred stone or some similar object.

+134+. In more civilized agricultural communities these ceremonies persist in attenuated form.
There is a sacrifice of first-born animals to a deity and an offering of the first fruits of
the field; and as children, no less than crops, are the gift of the gods, whose bounty must
be recognized, it is not surprising to find that, along with the first fruits of the field,
first-born children are sometimes sacrificed to the deity. Such a custom is reported as existing
or having existed in New South Wales, Florida, East Africa, heathen Russia, the Fiji Islands,
and Northern India.[269] A trace of the custom among the early Hebrews is, probably, to be
recognized in the provision of the Old Testament code that the first-born children are to be
redeemed by an animal sacrifice.[270]

+135+. In the course of time many ceremonies grew up in connection with the procuring and housing
of crops and other supplies. In Australia the men of the clan charged with assuring any sort
of food were unarmed and fasted during their ceremony.[271] Among the Kondyan plowing and sowing
are solemn seasons, an auspicious day is chosen, and there are religious songs and choruses.[272]
For the Hos of Northeastern India the harvest home is a great festival, held with sacrifice
and prayer (though also with great license of manners).[273] A dim conception of law underlies
all these procedures. The law is sometimes natural, as in imitative processes, sometimes religious,
as when blood is employed or the agency of religious official persons is called in.

+136+. The economical importance of rain has led to various quasi-scientific and magical devices
for securing it, and to the rise of professional rain makers. The methods commonly employed
are mimic representations of rainfall or of a storm.[274] The Australian Arunta have a rain
clan whose function is to bring the desired supply by nonsacred dancing festivals and sacred
ceremonies. A more advanced method is to dip a stone, as rain-god, into a stream.[275] Certain
American tribes assign the duty of rain making to secret societies or to priests.

+137+. All such economical ceremonies disappear with the progress of knowledge, though traces
of them linger long in civilized communities. Messrs. Spencer and Gillen note the gradual disappearance
of the economical and magical aspect of ceremonies in parts of Australia, and a similar process
is to be observed elsewhere.[276]

APOTROPAIC CEREMONIES

+138+. The savage and half-civilized belief (a belief that has survived to some extent in civilized
communities) is that the ills that afflict or threaten a community (such as epidemics and shortage
of crops) are due not to natural causes but to supernatural agencies. But man, it is held,
may control the hostile supernatural agents--they are subject to fear and other emotions, and
though powerful are not omnipotent; they may be expelled or otherwise got rid of--violence
may be used against them, or the aid of stronger supernatural Powers may be called in. In pursuance
of these ends ceremonies have been devised in many parts of the world; though differing in
details they are alike in principle; the question is how man may become the master of the demons.
The ceremonies are sometimes performed on the occasion of particular afflictions, sometimes
are massed at stated seasons, as at the beginning of the year or in connection with some agricultural
festival.

+139+. Man's defensive attitude toward the supernatural world appears in many usages connected
with ordinary life. Fear of the hostility of ghosts has led surviving friends to take precautions
against their return--their own houses are closed to them and they are driven away with blows.[277]
They are too near akin to be trusted, and they are believed to be able and willing to do harm.[278]
At the other extreme of life, when the child comes into the world, mother and child must be
guarded against hostile demonic influences.[279] When a demon is known to have entered into
a human being, producing sickness or madness, exorcism must be resorted to; magicians, prophets,
and saints are able by ceremonies or by prayer to expel the intruder and restore the afflicted
to health. Ritual taint (which is supernatural), incurred, for example, by touching a dead
body, is removed by sprinkling with sacred water.[280]

+140+. But the term "apotropaic" is generally used of expulsive ceremonies in which a whole
community takes part. In the simplest forms of procedure the hostile spirits are driven out
of the village by shouts and blows; crowds of men rush through the streets, searching houses,
expelling spirits at every possible point of ingress, and finally forcing them outside the
limits of the community. Examples of such a custom are found in the Pacific Islands, Australia,
Japan, Indonesia, West Africa, Cambodia, India, North America (Eskimo), South America (Peru),[281]
and there are survivals in modern Europe. In China this wholesale expulsion is still practiced
in a very elaborate form.[282] Among the Ainu, it is said, on the occasion of any accident
the "spirit of accidents" (a useful generalization) is driven away by the community.[283] In
these cases the spirits are thought of as being in a sort corporeal, sensitive to blows, and
also as afraid of noise. There is sometimes a combination of natural and supernatural conceptions:
while the violent expulsive process is going on the household utensils are vigorously washed
by the women; washing, known to cleanse from mere physical dirt, here also takes on, from its
association with the men's ceremony of expulsion, a supernatural potency--it removes the injurious
mana of the hostile spirits.

+141+. Less violent methods of riddance may be employed. Evil, being a physical thing, may
be embodied in some object, nonhuman or human, which is then carried forth or sent away to
some distant point, or destroyed. With this principle of transference may be compared the conception
of solidarity of persons and things in a tribe or other community: what one unit does or suffers
affects all--the presence of an accursed thing with one person brings a curse on his nation,[284]
and conversely, the removal of the evil thing or person removes the curse, which may, under
certain circumstances, be shifted to some other place or person.

+142+. The particular method of expulsion or transference is immaterial.[285] The troublesome
evil may be carted or boated away according to local convenience, or it may depart in the person
of an animal. Leprous taint is transferred to a bird, which, having been dipped in the blood
of a sacred animal, is allowed to fly away carrying the taint off from the community.[286]
Even moral evils (sin) may thus be got rid of. In the great Hebrew annual ceremony of atonement
not only the ritual impurity of the sanctuary and the altar, but also the sin of the nation,
is laid on a goat and sent away to the wilderness demon, Azazel.[287]

+143+. Examples of human apotropaic vehicles occur in the ancient civilized world. In the Athenian
Thargelia the Pharmakos was supposed to bear in his person crimes and evils, and was driven
forth from the city.[288] The same conception is found, perhaps, in the Roman Mamuralia and
Lupercalia. In the first of these Mamertius is driven forth from the city and consigned to
the keeping of hostile persons;[289] in the second, young men ran about the streets beating
the women with strips of goatskin, the skin being that of a sacred animal--a proceeding that
was regarded as purificatory, and seems to be naturally explicable as an expulsion of evil
spirits or injurious mana.[290]

+144+. In another direction expulsion of evil, or protection against it, is effected by the
blood of a sacrificed (and therefore sacred) animal. A well-known example of this sort of ceremony
is the Hebrew pesah (the old lamb ceremony, later combined with the agricultural festival of
unleavened bread, at the time of the first harvest, the two together then constituting the
passover); here the doorposts and lintel of every house were sprinkled with the blood of a
slain lamb by the master of the house,[291] and the hostile spirits hovering in the air were
thus prevented from entering. The sacred blood seems to have been conceived of as carrying
with it the power of the family god (who was also the clan god), which overbore that of the
demons (in the earliest period, however, the efficacy was doubtless held to reside simply in
the blood itself). The ceremony belonged to each family, but it belonged also to the clan since
it was performed by every family, and ultimately it became a national usage.

+145+. Apotropaic ceremonies appear to have been performed originally at various times during
the year as occasions arose; the increasing pressure of occupations,[292] the necessity of
consulting people's convenience, and the demand for order and precision led here (as in other
cases) to the massing of the observances. When so massed they begin to lose their original
significance, to yield to the knowledge of natural law, to be reinterpreted from time to time,
and finally to become mere social events or to be dropped altogether. Apotropaism has hardly
survived at all in the higher religions.[293] In popular customs it appears in the reliance
placed on horseshoes and other objects as means of keeping witches and similar demonic things
out of houses.[294]

CEREMONIES OF PUBERTY AND INITIATION

+146+. Ceremonies in connection with the arrival of young persons, male and female, at the
age of maturity appear to be universal, and they yield in importance to no other class of social
procedures. The basis of most of these is civil; their object is to prepare young persons for
entering on the active duties of what may be called citizenship. They involve a distinct idea
of the importance of the clan, the necessity of maintaining its life unimpaired, and, to that
end, preparing with the utmost care the younger portion of the community to take up the duties
of the older. The boys are to be trained to be the hunters and rulers of the clan, the girls
are to be fitted to become the wives and mothers of the next generation. But while the ceremonies
in question have their foundation in the needs of civil life, they inevitably receive a religious
coloring, since religion is intimately connected with all the details of early life.

+147+. Among the details of the initiation of boys, tests of endurance occupy a prominent place.
In various ways the capacity of the lad to endure physical pain or to face apparent dangers
is tested,[295] and in some cases one who fails to stand such tests is refused admission into
the clan and forever after occupies an inferior and despised position. Such persons are sometimes
treated as women; they are required to wear women's dress and to do menial work.[296]

+148+. The seclusion of girls on arriving at the age of puberty, with imposition of various
taboos (of food, etc.), is a widespread custom. The mysterious change in the girl is supposed
to be produced by some supernatural and dangerous Power, and she is therefore to be shielded
from contact with all injurious things. The details of the procedure depend on local ideas,
but the principle is the same everywhere. The object is the preparation of the girl for civic
life, and the ceremony inevitably becomes connected with tribal cults of the supernatural Powers.[297]

+149+. A rearrangement of taboos is a frequent feature in ceremonies of puberty and initiation.
Certain taboos, no longer needed, are removed and others are imposed; these latter refer, in
the case of boys, to intercourse with the men and women of the clan or tribe--they are instructed
not to speak to certain persons, and in general they are made acquainted with the somewhat
elaborate social system that prevails in many early tribes. These taboos are intended to prepare
the boys to understand their position as members of the tribe, responsible for the maintenance
of its customs. The taboos relating to food have arisen from conditions whose origins belong
to a remote and unrecorded past, and remain obscure.[298]

+150+. When the ceremony of initiation is elaborate and secret, it becomes mysterious to boys,
is looked forward to by them with apprehension, and appeals to their imagination. Supernatural
terrors are provided by the leaders--noises are heard (made by the bull-roarer or some similar
device), and the report is circulated that the initiate is in danger of death at the hands
of a supernatural being. These methods testify to the importance attached by early societies
to the introduction of the young into social and political life, and they furnish an early
example of the employment of the supernatural for the government of the masses. The old men
do not believe in their supernatural machinery, and the boys, after initiation, are let into
the secret.

+151+. Mutilation of the body is a widespread custom in connection with initiation and arrival
at the age of puberty.[299] In most cases the origin of mutilating customs is obscure. Imitation
of the form or appearance of a sacred animal, embellishment of the initiate, or consecration
of a part of the body to a deity have been suggested as motives; but there is no clear evidence
of such designs. The knocking out of a tooth may be for convenience in taking food; it seems
not to have religious significance except in so far as all tribal marks become religiously
important.[300] Boring through the septum of the nose is perhaps for decorative purposes. The
cutting of the hair is possibly for convenience, possibly for dedication to a deity.[301]

+152+. Among the most important of the customs of initiation are those connected with the organs
of generation, excluding, as is remarked above, complete excision, which belongs to conceptions
of religious asceticism (consecration to a deity, preservation against temptation) in the higher
cults, and is not found among savages.[302] Partial excision occurs in circumcision, for males,
and in similar operations for females.

+153+. Circumcision of males.[303] The most widely diffused of such customs of initiation is
the gashing or the complete removal of the prepuce. It existed in ancient times among the Egyptians,
the Canaanites, and the Hebrews (for the Arabs, the Syrians, and the Babylonians and Assyrians
we have no information), not, so far as the records go, among the Greeks, Romans, and Hindus.
At the present time it is found among all Moslems and most Jewish communities, throughout Africa,
Australia, Polynesia and Melanesia, and, it is said, in Eastern Mexico. It is hardly possible
to say what its original distribution was, and whether or not there was a single center of
distribution. As to its origin many theories have been advanced. Its character as initiatory
is not an explanation--all customs of initiation need to have their origins explained. It may
be said at the outset that a usage prevalent in low tribes and clearly beginning under savage
conditions of life must, probably, have sprung from some simple physical need, not from advanced
scientific or religious conceptions. We may briefly examine the principal explanations of its
origin that have been offered.

+154+. It cannot be regarded as a test of endurance, for it involves no great suffering, and
neither it nor the severer operation of subincision[304] (practiced in Australia) is ever spoken
of as an official test.

+155+. A hygienic ground is out of the question for early society. The requisite medical observation
is then lacking, and there is no hint of such a motive in the material bearing on the subject.
Circumcision is employed in modern surgery for certain diseases and as a generally helpful
operation, but such employment appears to be modern and of limited extent. The exact meaning
of Herodotus's statement that the Egyptians were circumcised for the sake of cleanliness, preferring
it to beauty,[305] is not clear; but in any case so late an idea throws no light on the beginnings.

+156+. Somewhat more to the point is Crawley's view that the object of the removal of the prepuce
is to get rid of the dangerous emanation from the physical secretion therewith connected.[306]
Such an object would issue from savage ideas of magic, the secretions of the human body (as
urine and dung) being often supposed to contain the power resident in all life. But this view,
though conceivably correct, is without support from known facts. There is no trace of fear
of the secretion in question, and the belief in power, when such a belief appears, attaches
rather to the oblated prepuce (which is sometimes preserved as a sort of charm, or hidden,
or swallowed by the boy or by some other person) than to the secretion. Nor does this theory
account for the custom of subincision.

+157+. As circumcision is often performed shortly before marriage it has been suggested that
its object is to increase procreative power by preventing phimosis.[307] The opinion that such
is its effect, though it has no scientific support, has been and is held by not a few persons.
Such an object, however, is improbable for low stages of society--it implies an extent of observation
that is not to be assumed for savages; and there is, besides, the fact that certain tribes
(in Australia and elsewhere) that practice circumcision do not connect the birth of children
with sexual intercourse. In general it is not to be supposed that savages make well-considered
physical preparation for marriage in the interests of procreation. The choice of mates is determined
by tribal law, but in other respects the individual is generally left free before marriage
to satisfy his appetite--it is instinct that controls the relations between the sexes.

+158+. There is no clear evidence that the origin of circumcision is to be traced to religious
conceptions. It has been held that it is connected with the cult of the generative organs (phallic
worship).[308] It is true that a certain sacredness often attached to these organs; this appears,
for example, in the oath taken by laying the hands upon or under the thigh, as in the story
of Abraham.[309] In some parts of Africa circumcision is directly connected or combined with
the worship of the phallus.[310] But, on the other hand, each of these customs is found frequently
without the other: in India we have phallic worship without circumcision, in Australia circumcision
without phallic worship; and this separateness of the two may be said to be the rule. The cult
of the phallus seems not to exist among the lowest peoples.

+159+. The view that circumcision is of the nature of a sacrifice or dedication to a deity,
particularly to a deity of fertility, appears to be derived from late usages in times when
more refined ideas have been attached to early customs. The Phrygian practice of excision was
regarded, probably, as a sacrifice. But elsewhere, in Egypt, Babylonia, Syria, and Canaan,
where the worship of gods and goddesses of fertility was prominent, we do not find circumcision
connected therewith. In the writings of the Old Testament prophets it is treated as a symbol
of moral purification. Among the lower peoples there is no trace of the conception of it as
a sacrifice. It is not circumcision that makes the phallus sacred--it is sacred in itself,
and all procedures of savage veneration for the prepuce assume its inherent potency.

+160+. Nor can circumcision be explained as an attenuated survival of human sacrifice. The
practice (in Peru and elsewhere) of drawing blood from the heads or hands of children on solemn
occasions may be a softening of an old savage custom, and the blood of circumcision is sacred.
But this quality attaches to all blood, and the essential thing in circumcision is not the
blood but the removal of the prepuce.

+161+. The suggestion that the object of detaching and preserving the foreskin (a vital part
of one's self) is to lay up a stock of vital energy, and thus secure reincarnation for the
disembodied spirit,[311] is putting an afterthought for origin. The existence of the practice
in question is doubtful, and it must have arisen, if it existed, after circumcision had become
an established custom. Savages and other peoples, when they feel the need of providing for
reincarnation, commonly preserve the bones or the whole body of the deceased.

+162+. Circumcision and other operations performed on females. Circumcision of girls is practiced
by many African savage tribes (Nandi, Masai, Mandingos, and others), by Malays and Arabs, Gallas
and Abessinians and others. Introcision appears to be confined to Australia. Infibulation is
practiced in Northeastern Africa and by the Mohammedan Malays.[312] The effect, and doubtless
the purpose, of the first and second of these operations is to facilitate coition; the object
of the third is to prevent coition until the proper time for it arrives. They are all connected
more or less with initiation or with arrival at the age of puberty, and they are, naturally,
sometimes associated with other ceremonies.

+163+. Origin of circumcision. The preceding review may be taken to make it probable that the
origin of circumcision is not to be referred to reflection or to religious ideas. We must look
for a cruder motive, and several considerations point to the desire to facilitate coition as
the starting-point of the custom (so also R. F. Burton). Reports from all over the savage world
testify to the prominence of sexual intercourse in the lower forms of human life. Folk-stories
are full of coarse details of the practice. Popular festivals are often characterized by gross
license. To lend a wife to a guest is in many places a recognized rule of hospitality.[313]
In all this there is nothing immoral--it is permitted by the existing law and is in accord
with the current ideas of propriety. Early man seems in this regard to have obeyed his animal
appetite without reflection. This form of pleasure occupied (and occupies) a great part of
his life, and it was not unnatural that he should seek to remove all hindrances from it. It
is quite conceivable that early observation led him to regard the prepuce as a hindrance.

+164+. About the motives of early man in the adoption of these customs of excision we have,
of course, no direct information; but some later usages favor the explanation suggested above.
The operations performed on females are obviously dictated by considerations of convenience
or propriety in coition. Various means are adopted of increasing the pleasure of sexual intercourse
(in Indonesia and elsewhere).[314] These procedures are purely animal, nonmoral, and without
ulterior design; there is no thought of progeny or, in general, of preparation for marriage--the
frame of mind is appropriate to the lowest grade of life.

+165+. In the course of time, however, all such customs tend to become sanctified and to take
on new meanings. When the importance of circumcision was generally felt, it was natural that
it should be performed at puberty and at initiation.[315] It would thus come to be regarded
as an introduction to the tribal life--not as preparation, but as a custom established by unwritten
law. Its origination would be put far back in the past and sometimes ascribed to supernatural
personages--the Central Australians refer it to the mythical ancestors, the later Jews to the
command of the national deity issued to the legendary or mythical ancestor Abram.[316] Under
certain circumstances it might become a tribal mark; the Hebrews thus distinguished themselves
from their neighbors the Philistines, and "uncircumcised" was a term of reproach.[317]

+166+. Apart from its use in initiation the cultic rôle of circumcision has been small. It
does not appear as an element in the worship of any deity, neither in that of such gods as
Osiris, Tammuz, Adonis, Attis, nor in that of any other. It is not represented in ancient records
as a devotion of one's self or an assimilation of one's self or of a child to the tribal or
national god. Its performance is generally a religious duty, as is true of every established
custom, but this fact throws no light on its origin. The prepuce is sometimes treated as an
amulet or in general as a magically powerful or sacred thing; but many other parts of the body
(hair, finger nails, etc.) are so treated.

+167+. In the higher religions circumcision is generally viewed as an act of physical purification
or as a symbol of moral purification. The former view, perhaps, prevailed in Egypt, though
on this point the records appear to be silent.[318] The latter view is that of the Old Testament
prophets and the New Testament.[319] It has now ceased to have any effective religious significance,
and is retained in some communities merely as a national social tradition or as an ancient
divine ordinance.

+168+. The origin of circumcision suggested above seems to account sufficiently for all usages
and ideas connected with it; the possibility of several different origins need not be denied,
but the practical identity of the customs in all parts of the world in which the institution
exists, makes the simpler hypothesis the more probable.

+169+. Certain features of ceremonies of initiation appear to be designed to secure union between
the initiate and the clan. Such, for example, is the custom found in New South Wales of the
initiate's drinking the blood of his companions. In other cases there is a union with other
parts of the body. Such usages arise from the idea that physical union is essential to social
union--a conception which elsewhere takes the form of blood-brotherhood.[320] This is a scientific
rather than a religious idea, depending on the belief that the body is an essential part of
the personality.[321]

+170+. Another noteworthy custom is the feigned resurrection of the initiate. In Australia
the women are informed that the youth during the process of initiation is slain by a supernatural
being and brought to life again. Elsewhere the initiate is supposed to forget his former life
completely and to be obliged, on emerging from the ceremony, to recover slowly his knowledge
of things.[322] The origin of this custom is obscure, but it appears to express the idea that
the youth now enters on an entirely new life, and having come into new relations and responsibilities,
is to forget what he was and what he did before--a profound conception which has been taken
up into some of the most advanced religions (as, for example, in baptism and confirmation).

+171+. In certain half-civilized tribes a higher type of initiatory ceremonies is found. The
youth must perform a lonely vigil, going into the forest or some other solitary place, and
there wait for the vision or revelation of a supernatural protector.[323] This procedure is
connected with the advance of individualism, the old totemic or other relation being superseded
by an individual relation to a guardian spirit. The development of this higher religious conception
will be discussed below.[324]

+172+. Finally, instruction forms a part of most initiation ceremonies. The youth is told the
secrets of the tribe, and is thus inducted into its higher and more intimate life.[325] This
confiding of tribal secrets (the tradition and the knowledge of sacred things) to the young
man about to enter on public life is a political necessity, but in the nature of the case connects
itself with religious conceptions. Generally, also, moral instruction is given.[326] The ethical
code is usually good so far as intratribal relations are concerned (foreigners are not considered):
the youth is told that he must obey his elders, respect the rights of his fellow clansmen,
and especially be careful in his attitude toward women. In some cases a supernatural sanction
for such instructions is added; it is impressed on the youth that some supernatural being will
punish him if he disobeys these instructions. The moral code in question is one which springs
naturally and necessarily from the relations of men in society, and the supernatural sanction
affixed to it is a consequence of the belief that the tribal deity is the lord of the tribe
and the natural and most effective guardian of its rights.

+173+. From this brief statement of initiation ceremonies it appears that they rest substantially
on social ideas and necessities. Religion enters into them, as is pointed out above, when a
superhuman being is represented as the patron of the clan and the protector of its ceremonies,
or when the moral teaching is referred to such a being, or when the initiate seeks a supernatural
patron with whom to enter into relations, or when, as in some North Australian tribes, the
supernatural being is believed to be angry at the omission of the ceremonies. This last case
might recall the displeasure of the Greek gods when sacrifices to them were withheld or diminished;
but more probably it involves simply the belief that all important ceremonies and affairs are
under the control of the being in question, who demands obedience to him as lord.

+174+. In later stages of savage or semicivilized life the clan constitution as a rule has
been succeeded by the formation of secret societies, and then initiation into a society takes
the place of the old initiation into the clan.[327] Initiation into such a society is often
elaborate and solemn--it is carried out in great detail in many Polynesian, African, and North
American tribes--but its general features are the same as those of the earlier procedure. Savage
societies and civilized mysteries all have their secrets and their moral instruction, and they
all represent an advance in individualism. Still later the church takes the place of the mysteries,
and here the process of initiation, though more refined, is still in essence identical with
the earlier forms.[328] Naturally in the increasing refinement of the ceremonies there is an
increasing prominence of the supernatural element, for the reason that the special care of
religion recedes more and more from general society (which tends to occupy itself with civil
and political questions solely), and is intrusted to special voluntary organizations.

MARRIAGE CEREMONIES

+175+. Marriage is so important a fact for the communal life that it has always been regulated
to a greater or less extent by the community, which defines its methods, rights, and obligations.[329]

+176+. In the lowest known tribes the ceremony of marriage is simple: the woman is given to
the man by the constituted authorities--that is, the relatives of the parties and the elders
of the clan or tribe--and by that act the two become husband and wife. At this stage of social
growth the stress is laid on preparation for marriage in the ceremonies of puberty and initiation.
The members of the tribe being thus prepared for union, marriage is merely the assignment of
a given woman to a given man. The wife is selected according to established custom; that is,
in accordance with customary law, which in most cases defines precisely from what group of
the tribe the woman proper to a given man shall be taken.

+177+. Though the origin of this law goes back to a remote antiquity and is involved in obscurity,
it seems to have been originally simply a matter of social agreement. It came to be, however,
connected with systems of totemism and taboo, and thus to have acquired a certain religious
character; and, as being important for the tribal life, it would come under the control of
the tribal god when there is such a god. A similar remark may be made in regard to exogamy.
Why marriage between members of the same tribe, clan, or phratry should be prohibited is not
clear.[330] The rule arose, doubtless, from some social feature of ancient society, and only
later was involved in the general religious atmosphere.[331]

+178+. Gradually greater freedom of choice was allowed men and women, and the ceremonies of
marriage became more elaborate. Certain of these seem intended to secure the complete union
of husband and wife; such, for example, are the customs of eating together, of the inoculation
of each party with the blood of the other or with some bodily part of the other, and the giving
of presents by each to the other. All these rest on the conception that union between two persons
is effected by each taking something that belongs to the other; each thus acquires something
of the other's personality. This is a scientific biological idea; and though it had its origin
doubtless in some very crude notion of life, it has maintained itself in one form or another
up to the present time.

+179+. Among many communities the custom is for the bride to hide herself and to be pursued
and taken by the bridegroom. This custom, again, is in its origin obscure. Almost certainly
it does not point to original marriage by capture, for of such a customary method of acquiring
wives there is no trace in savage communities (though in particular cases women may have been
captured and married). Possibly it reflects merely the coyness of the woman; or it may be simply
a festive procedure, an occasion of fun for the young people, as indeed a wedding now commonly
is. In many cases, however, it appears to represent the transference of the woman from her
own tribe to that of her husband. Though she was thus transferred bodily and brought into civic
relations with the latter, certain taboos, arising from her original tribal position, often
clung to her. The right to dwell in her own house in her own tribe, and to receive there her
foreign husband, belongs to a relatively late social stage.[332]

+180+. The defloration of the woman before marriage is rather a preparation for marriage than
a marriage ceremony; or it may represent the social right of the elders of the tribe and the
relatives of the bride to the possession of her, perhaps symbolizing her entrance into a family.[333]
The hypothesis that such a custom points to primitive promiscuity is ably combated by Westermarck,
and is involved in great difficulties; it is, however, maintained by Messrs. Spencer and Gillen
in their two works on Australian tribes, whose customs seem to them to be inexplicable except
on the supposition of primitive promiscuity, in spite of Westermarck's arguments; and in support
of this view the sexual license granted in many tribes to unmarried girls may be adduced. However
this may be, the custom in question appears to be civil and not religious. The same thing is
true of the ceremonies in which bridegroom and bride are hailed as king and queen--a very natural
form of merrymaking.[334] The purchase of wives is probably a simple commercial act.

+181+. The marriage ceremonies mentioned above appear to be all social in their nature. Into
them the supernatural is introduced in proportion as the conception of a divine control of
society obtains.[335] On the other hand, those customs which are intended to ward off evil
spirits or general evil influences from the married pair are religious or magical.

+182+. Mr. Crawley[336] holds that all marriage ceremonies are essentially religious, as involving
the conception of something strange and dangerous in the contact of men and women; they are
intended, he thinks, to neutralize dangers by reversing taboos and by assimilating the two
persons each to the other, the dangers in question being not merely distinctly sexual but those
of contact in general. Though he carries his application of the principle of taboo too far,
he has collected a large number of examples which illustrate the separation between the sexes
in early society, and the taboos which hold in their social intercourse. The separation of
the sexes in early times seems to have resulted largely from the difference in their occupations
and the consequent isolation of each from the other. Possibly one result of this isolation
was that each saw something strange and wonderful in the other; but it must be remembered that
the taboo laws were made by men and are therefore directed particularly against women. The
belief in the sacredness of life would act more particularly on the ideas concerning birth.

+183+. Among many half-civilized peoples and generally in Christian communities marriage is
regarded both as a religious ceremony and as a civil contract, and is controlled in the one
case by the religious authorities, in the other case by the civil authorities. In Mohammedan
communities marriage is simply a civil contract, but religious ceremonies are often connected
with it.[337]

CEREMONIES AT BIRTH

+184+. It is possible that early man was so impressed by the fact of life and the wonderfulness
of the birth of a human being that he included this latter fact in the sphere of the supernatural,
and that the taboos connected with it arose from his dread of supernatural, dangerous influence.[338]
Many of the ceremonies connected with the birth of a child may be explained easily as resulting
from the natural care for mother and child. Both of these are, in the modern sense of the term,
sacred; and even in very early times ordinary humane feeling would seek to protect them from
injury.[339]

+185+. Thus the curious custom of the couvade,[340] in which the husband, and not the wife,
goes to bed on the birth of the child, may be an effort on the man's part to share in the labor
of the occasion, since he has to take care of the child; or it may be primarily an economical
procedure--the woman must go out to work and the man must therefore stay at home to take care
of the house and the child. But probably something more than this is involved--there seems
to be fear of supernatural danger. It is not necessary to suppose that the man takes the woman's
place in order to attract to himself the malevolent spirits that figure on such occasions;
but the belief in the intimate vital connection between father and child may induce the desire
to guard the former against injury. Similar precautions are taken in regard to the mother;[341]
some of these have a natural basis in her physical condition which necessitates a certain carefulness.
Where such customs connected with birth prevail, departure from them is thought to be dangerous
or fatal; but such a feeling exists in regard to all social customs.

+186+. The belief that the newborn child is the reincarnation of an ancestor is scientific
rather than religious. In Central Australia every child is held to be the reincarnation of
a spirit ancestor; a similar idea is found in North America, in Western Africa, and in Orissa.[342]
In searching for the cause of birth it is not unnatural that it should be ascribed to a preëxistent
being who desires to enter again into human life.[343]

+187+. The ablutions or sprinklings of water practiced in some places appear to be merely the
expression of welcome into the community.[344] The choice of a name for the child is frequently
connected with religious ideas. Among many tribes the custom is to seek for some hint from
the child itself, as by repeating a number of names and observing which of them the child seems
to recognize or accept. The help of a deity is sometimes invoked, as in Borneo, where a pig
is killed and its spirit thus sent as messenger to a particular god, who is asked to approve.[345]
In Samoa a tutelary spirit is sometimes chosen for the infant;[346] during childhood the child
bears the name of a god, who seems to be regarded as its protector. The identification of person
and name, common among savages, is also scientific rather than religious. At the entrance into
a secret society the novitiate may receive a new name.[347] The adoption of a child's name
by the father (teknonymy) may be simply the expression of paternal pride, or possibly it is
the expression of the father's protection or of his identification with the child. The adoption
of a secret name that involves the man's personality and is therefore to be withheld from enemies
belongs to adult life.

+188+. The taboos imposed on the mother during pregnancy and after the birth of the child,
often numerous and oppressive, are derived from local conditions, and are generally regulated
by religion. With the growth of refinement they tend to disappear, while the attendant ceremonies
take on a moral and spiritual character, culminating, in the great religions, in the conception
that the babe, as a child of God, is to be taken into the religious fellowship of the community
and trained for a good life.

BURIAL CEREMONIES[348]

+189+. Among savage peoples grief for the dead expresses itself in a variety of violent ceremonies
of mourning, such as wailing, and cutting and gashing the body. These are partly expressions
of natural sorrow,[349] but may be intended in part to propitiate the dead, who thus sees that
honor is paid him.

+190+. The belief that the dead person is powerful expresses itself in the care with which
the grave is guarded, it being held that injury to the grave is an injury to the dead, and
likely, therefore, to excite his anger. Further, savage science as a rule does not recognize
natural causes of death. It regards death as murder, and there is accordingly search for the
murderer, often by protracted ceremonies with the aid of a magician. The well-being of the
dead man is provided for by placing food and drink, utensils and weapons in his grave, that
he may have the means of enjoyment in the other world.[350] To assure him proper service his
wives and slaves are sometimes slain, that their souls may accompany his; but this custom is
not found among the lowest tribes--it belongs to a relatively advanced conception of the other
life.[351] In many cases blood is sprinkled on the ground near the grave of the corpse, as
in Borneo (the blood of a fowl);[352] the blood may be meant to be food for the dead, or its
supernatural power may be supposed to guard against injury from him to the living.

+191+. A ban of silence is often imposed--the name of the dead person is not to be mentioned
except by certain privileged men;[353] among certain North American tribes on the death of
a child there is a ban of silence on the father.[354] The reason for this prohibition of the
dead person's name is not certain. It may be respect for him, or it may be merely an expression
of sorrow at his loss. More probably, however, it comes from the belief that the dead man is
powerful and may be hurtful, and that therefore his name, which is identical with himself,
is dangerous.[355]

+192+. In the cases mentioned above, the dead person is generally regarded as dangerous--to
be feared and appeased. Among some tribes, indeed, precautions are taken to prevent his coming
back to his house. Very generally the presence of the corpse is held to cause a certain pollution.[356]
There is, however, another side to the attitude toward the dead. As he is regarded as powerful,
parts of his body are preserved as amulets; wives wear parts of the bones of the dead husband,
and the skulls of the deceased are supposed to be especially powerful, in some cases to give
oracular responses.[357]

+193+. In general, early burial ceremonies appear to be designed to assure the comfort of the
deceased in the other world with a view to securing his friendship and aid for the members
of his family and clan in this life. As he is of the nature of a divine person, the ceremonies
in question are naturally religious. Socially they are effective in binding the members of
a community together--a large sense of solidarity is produced by the communal recognition of
kinship with the dead. Special stress is laid on this conception in China.[358]

CEREMONIES OF PURIFICATION AND CONSECRATION[359]

+194+. The essence of religion is a helpful relation to the supernatural, but in early stages
of culture man frequently finds himself exposed to conditions, either resident in himself or
induced from without, that destroy this relation and disqualify him for the performance of
sacred acts. The result is a state of ritual impurity or uncleanness, conceived of at first
as purely physical, but tending to become gradually moralized. The removal of the disqualification
constitutes purification; the positive preparation for the performance of a sacred act constitutes
consecration; the two procedures represent two sides of the same idea, and they are related
in a general way to ceremonies of initiation and atonement.

+195+. The occasions for purification are numerous, including all contacts or possibilities
of contact with dangerous (sacred) things, and thus often coinciding with taboo conceptions.[360]
All acts connected with procreation and birth; contact with a corpse, or with a sacred person
or thing, or with an object belonging to a sacred person; return from a journey (in the course
of which the traveler may have been exposed to some injurious supernatural influence)[361]--such
things as these call for cleansing. Inanimate objects also, especially such as are connected
with religious worship (altars, vessels, and instruments), require purification; these are
thought of originally as having souls, and as incurring defilement by the transmission of neighboring
impurities. A moral conception may seem to be involved in the requirement of purification after
the committal of a murder; certainly, in the more advanced stages of society, the feeling in
this case is moral, but it is doubtful whether in earlier stages anything more is involved
than the recognition of ritual defilement by contact with blood; homicide, as a social crime,
is dealt with by the civil law, and is generally excluded from the benefits of acts of ritual
atonement,[362] and so also all violations of tribal law.

+196+. The religious preparation for the performance of a sacred act usually concerns official
persons (see below, under consecration, § 202), but sometimes involves the purification of
others. The largest act of purification is that which includes a whole community or people;[363]
the social mass is then regarded as a unit, and there is no reason, according to early thought,
why such a mass should not, by a ceremony, be freed from all ritual disabilities, the idea
of moral purification being, of course, absent or latent. Finally, ritual purification is sometimes
a preliminary to pleasing and influencing the deity, who, as the most sacred and most dangerous
object, must be approached with the greatest precautions.[364]

+197+. The various methods of purification may be included under a few heads, the principal
of which are: the application of water (bathing, sprinkling); the application of sand, dung,
bark, and similar things; exposure to fire; incantation and sacrifice; and fasting. In all
these cases the virtue lies either in a sacred thing or act that has the quality of dissipating
the mysterious defilement present, or in the removal or avoidance of the defiling thing; it
is frequently required that the application of the cleansing substance be made by a sacred
person, whose character adds potency to the act. The use of water for ceremonial purification
has been, and is, practiced all over the world, alike by savages and by civilized peoples:[365]
the newborn child, ritually impure by reason of the mystery of birth, is bathed or sprinkled;
before the performance of a sacred act the officiator must bathe;[366] numerous ablutions are
prescribed in the Old Testament; similar usages obtained among the Egyptians, the Hindus and
the Persians, the Greeks and the Romans, the Chinese and the Japanese, the Mexicans and the
Peruvians, and other peoples.

+198+. These usages have arisen doubtless from observation of the natural cleansing power of
water and other things in conjunction with the belief in their sacred character. Adopted by
the higher religions they have been more or less spiritualized by the infusion into them of
ideas of penitence, forgiveness of sin, and regeneration--so in India, Persia, and Peru. Christian
baptism seems to have come from Jewish proselyte baptism:[367] the proselyte was by immersion
in water symbolically cleansed from sin and introduced into a new religious life, and such
was the significance of the rite practiced by John, though his surname "the Baptizer" probably
indicates that he gave it a broader and deeper meaning; he overstepped national bounds, receiving
Jews as well as non-Jews.[368] Moslem ritual requires ablutions before the stated prayers and
at certain other times; every mosque has its tank of water for the convenience of worshipers.

+199+. Where water cannot be had, usage in Islam and in some forms of Christianity permits
the substitution of sand or dust--both thought to have cleansing power. Similar power is ascribed
to urine and dung of domestic animals.[369] Such usages may originate in a belief in the physical
cleansing efficacy of those substances (the Toda women employ dried buffalo's dung in household
cleaning), or they may be supposed to derive their efficacy from the sacredness of the animals.
The Todas also make much use of a certain bark for purification.[370] The origin of these customs
is obscure; they go back to times and conditions for a knowledge of which data are lacking--possibly
to the early conception of the sacredness of all natural objects.[371] It is less difficult
to explain the belief in the purifying power of fire. Its splendor and utility caused it to
be regarded as a god in India and Persia, and if it was also destructive, it often consumed
hurtful things. It was sacred, and might, therefore, be a remover of impurity. Its employment
for this purpose is, however, not frequent;[372] it is oftener used to consume corpses and
other unclean things.

+200+. In the more developed religious rituals, sacrifice is a common accompaniment of purifying
ceremonies, the object being to procure the forgiveness of the deity for the offense held to
be involved in the impurity; the conception of sin in such cases is sometimes physical, sometimes
moral, and the ceremony is always nearly allied to one of atonement. In the Hebrew ritual a
human bodily impurity and the apparatus of the temple alike require a sin-offering.[373] In
India the bath of purification stood in close relation with a sacrifice.[374] In Greece the
two were associated in the cults of Apollo and Dionysos and in ordinary worship in general.[375]
Thus, men and gods take part in the process of freeing the worshiper from the impure elements
of life: the man obeys the law of the ritual, and the god receives him into association with
the divine.

+201+. Ancient examples of the purification of a whole community are the Hebrew ceremony on
the annual day of atonement[376] (which is called in the text a purification), and the Roman
Lupercalia.[377] An elaborate festival of this sort was observed every year by the Creeks;[378]
it lasted eight days, included various cathartic observances, and ended in a physical and moral
reconstruction of the nation. Among the Todas a similar ceremony for the purification of a
village exists.[379]

+202+. Ceremonies of consecration are similar to those of purification, only usually more formal
and solemn. Entrance on a sacred function, which involves special direct contact with a deity,
requires special preparation. Even before a simple act of prayer it was felt to be proper to
cleanse one's person;[380] how much more important was bodily cleansing and other preparation
for one who was chosen by the community to represent it in its relations with the supernatural
Powers! The preparation for such an office is in earlier times ritual and external, and becomes
gradually moralized. Magicians must submit to purificatory restrictions, and prove their fitness
by various deeds.[381] Initiation into secret societies (whose members had a certain official
character) was, and is, often elaborate.[382] Priests in Egypt, Babylonia and Assyria, Canaan,
India, Greece and Rome, were subject to conditions of purity, always physical and sometimes
moral, that secured a daily consecration.

+203+. Methods of initial consecration were, probably, of the general character of those prescribed
in the Hebrew ritual law.[383] Authority is often conferred by a high official, whose consecrating
act is then generally regarded as essential.[384] The priest becomes invested with a quasi-divine
authority. The consecration of kings follows the same general lines as that of priests. In
both cases the desire is to have some visible form of the deity whose relations with men may
be felt to be direct.

+204+. No purificatory and consecrative usage has been more widespread than fasting.[385] It
is found throughout religious history in the lowest tribes and in the most highly civilized
peoples, has been practiced in a great variety of circumstances, and has been invested with
a special sanctity and efficacy. It has been regarded as necessary before partaking of sacred
food, before the performance of a sacred ceremony, after a death, in the presence of a great
occurrence (as an eclipse or a thunderstorm, regarded as supernatural), as a part of the training
of magicians, as a preparation for the search after a guardian spirit, as a part of ceremonies
in honor of gods, as an act of abstinence in connection with a calamity (or in general as a
self-denial proper to sinful man and pleasing to the deity as an act of humility), and, finally,
as a retirement from fleshly conditions in preparation for spiritual exercises.

+205+. A great number of explanations of the origin of the custom have been proposed, and it
is obvious that the particular usages come from somewhat different conceptions. Apparently,
however, all these usages of purification by fasting go back to the idea that the body, which
is identified with the human personality, is in its ordinary state nonsacred[386] and therefore
unfit for the performance of a sacred act, and that it is rendered especially unfit by contact
with a ritually unclean thing. Ordinary food, nourishing the body and becoming a part of it,
thus maintains it in its nonsacred character. This point of view appears in the practice of
administering a purge as a means of ceremonial purification; the Nandi, for example, give a
purge to a girl before her circumcision, and in some cases to any one who has touched a taboo
object.[387]

+206+. The essence of fasting is the avoiding of defiling food; this conception may be traced
in all instances of the practice, though it may be in some cases reënforced by other considerations,
and is sometimes spiritualized. The efficacy of sacred food would be destroyed if it came in
contact with common food, or it might itself become destructive.[388] A sacred ceremony demands
a sacred performer, one who has not taken a defiling substance into his being. Death diffuses
defilement, and makes the food in the house of the deceased dangerous.

+207+. Other ideas may here come in: abstinence may be a sign or a result of grief, though
this does not seem likely except in refined communities; or its ground may be fear of eating
the ghost, which is believed to be hovering about the dead body;[389] it is hardly the result
of "making excessive provision for the dead."[390] Special communion with supernatural Powers,
by magicians and others (including conditions of ecstasy), requires ritual purity, and similar
preparation of the body is proper when it is desired to avert the anger of a deity or to do
him honor.

+208+. Once established, the custom has maintained itself in the higher religions[391] in connection
with more or less definite spiritual aims and with other exercises, particularly prayer. The
dominant feeling is then self-denial, at the bottom of which the conviction appears to be that
the deity demands complete subordination in the worshiper and is displeased when he asserts
himself. This conviction, which is a fundamental element in all religious thought, pertains
properly only to inward experience, but naturally tends to annex nonspiritual acts of self-abnegation
like fasting. As a moral discipline, a training in the government of self and a preparation
for enduring times of real privation, fasting is regarded by many persons as valuable. Its
power to isolate the man from the world and thus minister to religious communion differs in
different persons. The Islamic fast of Ramadan is said to produce irritability and lead to
quarrels. In general, fasting tends to induce a nonnatural condition of body and mind, favorable
to ecstatic experiences, and favorable or not, as the case may be, to a genuine religious life.[392]

+209+. As with other religious observances, so with purificatory ceremonies the tendency is
to mass and organize them--they are made to occur at regular times and under fixed conditions,
as in the Christian Lent, the Moslem Ramadan, and the Creek Busk. Such arrangements give orderliness
to outward religious life, but are likely to diminish or destroy spontaneity in observances.
Ceremonies of this sort have great vitality--they are handed on from age to age, the later
religion adopting and modifying and reinterpreting the forms of the earlier. In such cases
the lower conceptions survive in the minds of the masses, and are moralized by the more spiritual
natures, and their influence on society is therefore of a mixed character.

CEREMONIES CONNECTED WITH SEASONS AND PERIODS

+210+. Some of these have already been mentioned under "Economic Ceremonies." We may here take
a general survey of festivals the times of whose celebration are determined by the divisions
of the year, and thus constitute calendars.[393] The earliest calendars appear to have been
fixed by observation of the times when it was proper to gather the various sorts of food--to
hunt animals and gather grubs and plants (as in Central Australia), or this or that species
of fish (as in Hawaii). The year was thus divided according to the necessities of life--seasons
were fixed by experience.

+211+. At a comparatively early period, however, the phases of the moon attracted attention,
and became the basis of calendars. Lunar calendars are found among savage and half-civilized
tribes of various grades of culture in Polynesia, Africa, Asia, and the Americas, and were
retained for a time by most ancient civilized peoples. Later observation included the movements
of the sun; it is only among advanced peoples that festivals are connected with equinoxes and
solstices. The more scientific calendars gradually absorbed the earlier, and it is probable
that simple ceremonies that were originally neither agricultural nor astral were taken up into
the later systems and reinterpreted.[394]

+212+. When, from observation of climatic conditions and lunar changes, a general division
of the year came to be made into spring, summer, autumn, and winter, or several similar seasons
(sometimes with intermediate points), festivals gradually arranged themselves in the various
periods. The terms designating the four seasons are, however, somewhat indefinite in regard
to position in the year and duration, varying in these points in different places, and it is
better, in considering agricultural ceremonies, to make a general division into times of planting
and times of harvesting. It is not certain whether lunar or agricultural festivals came first
in the development of public religious life, but as (omitting the lowest tribes) the former
are found where there is no well-organized agricultural system, we may begin with them.

+213+. The new moon, as marking the beginning of the month, and other phases of the moon are
frequently accompanied by observances of a more or less definitely religious character, with
great variety of detail in different places. The Nandi[395] have two seasons (the wet and the
dry) and twelve months named from meteorological phenomena, and each day in the month receives
a name from the attendant phase of the moon. The great ceremonies are conducted in the period
of the waxing of the moon, and its waning is an occasion of mourning. The new moon is greeted
with a prayer that it may bring blessing. A similar custom exists among the Masai.[396] On
the other hand the Todas, though the times of their festivals are all regulated by the moon,
appear to have no lunar ceremony;[397] if there was ever any such ceremony, it has been absorbed
by the buffalo cult. The South American Arawaks have six ceremonies in the year that seem to
be fixed by the appearance of the new moon.[398] The Hebrew first day of the (lunar) month
was observed with special religious ceremonies.[399] The full moon, the last phase of growth,
is less prominent; where it marks a festival day it is generally in connection with an agricultural
event, as among the non-Aryan Bhils of India[400] and in the later Hebrew calendar;[401] in
both these cases the observance occurs only once in the year.

+214+. The new moon of the first month marks the beginning of the year, and new year's day
is celebrated, particularly in the more advanced communities, with special observances. The
Hindu pongol and similar festivals are seasons of merriment, with giving of presents, and religious
exercises.[402] Though these occasions now include agricultural epochs, we may recognize in
them an interest in the beginning of a new era in life. A like character attaches to the celebration
of the Japanese new year's day.[403] Of Assyrian observances of the day little is known, but
at Babylon it was celebrated with great pomp, and with it was connected the conception of the
determination of human fortunes for the year by Marduk, the chief deity of the city.[404] The
late Old Testament ritual makes it a taboo day (first day of the seventh month, September-October);
no servile work is to be done, trumpets are to be blown (apparently to mark its solemnity),
and a special sacrifice is to be offered;[405] in post-Biblical times the feature of the divine
assignment of fates (probably adopted from the Babylonians) appears. The old Roman religious
year began with the kalends of March, when the sacred fire of Vesta was renewed, a procedure
obviously intended to introduce a new era; on the later civil new year's day (kalends of January)
presents were exchanged,[406] a custom everywhere relatively late, a feature in the gradual
secularization of ceremonies.

+215+. Solar festivals, as such, are less prominent than the lunar in religious ritual. Though
the sun was a great god widely worshiped, it was little used in the construction of early calendars.
Primitive astronomy knew hardly anything of solstices and equinoxes, and where these are noted
in the more advanced rituals, they appear to be attachments to observances founded on other
considerations--so the Roman Saturnalia, celebrated near the winter solstice, and apparently
the plebeian festival of the summer solstice attached to the worship of Fortuna; and the same
thing is probably true of the Semitic and Greek festivals that occurred near the equinoxes
and solstices.[407]

+216+. Elaborate solstitial ceremonies are practiced by the North American Pueblos.[408] A
well-developed solar system of festivals existed in Peru, where the sun was the central object
of worship; equinoxes and solstices were observed with great ceremonies, and especially at
the summer solstice the rising of the sun was hailed with popular rejoicing as a sign that
the favor of the deity would be extended to the nation.[409] Similar ceremonies may have existed
in Mexico and elsewhere, but in general, as is remarked above, the astronomical feature at
solar epochs yielded to other associations. Occasional festivals occur in connection with the
worship of stars (especially the morning star);[410] the Pleiades are objects of observation
among some low tribes, and in some cases (Society Islands, Tahiti, Hawaii, New Zealand) the
year began with the rising of these stars, but apparently no festivals are dedicated to them.[411]
In the later theistic development various deities are brought into connection with heavenly
bodies, and their cults absorb earlier observances.[412]

+217+. Socially the agricultural festivals are the most important of the early festival ceremonies;[413]
they unite the people in public observances, thus furthering the communal life, and they satisfy
the popular demand for amusement. Doubtless under any social conditions gatherings for merrymaking
would have arisen, but, by reason of the constitution of early society, they necessarily assume
a religious character. Whether for planting or for reaping, the local god must be considered;
it is he whose aid must be invoked for coming crops, and he must be thanked for successful
seasons. The festivals occur at various times in the year among various peoples, but the tone
of merriment is the predominant one--it is only in a few cases that a touch of seriousness
or sadness is found. Early festal calendars are largely agricultural. In Greece, Rome, and
Peru there was a succession of festivals, connected with planting and reaping, running substantially
through the year; other ceremonies, of course, stood side by side with them, but these were
relatively few.

+218+. Joyous festivals occur especially at the time of the ripening of crops and harvest.
The old Canaanite autumn feasts, adopted by the Hebrews, were seasons of good cheer.[414] In
Greece the Panathenæa fell in July-August, the Thesmophoria in October, and the Anthesteria
in February,--all agricultural, with joyous features;[415] of the similar Roman festivals the
Feriæ Latinæ fell in April, the Feriæ Jovi in August, the Saturnalia in December, and with
these should perhaps be included the Ambarvalia (in May) and the festival of the horse sacrifice
(in October).[416] Other ceremonies of this nature occur in India, New Zealand, Torres Straits
islands, and in the old Peruvian cult.

+219+. Popular festivities easily pass into license; examples are the Roman Saturnalia and
the Hindu Holi[417]; the harvest festival of the Hos of Northeastern India is a debauch,[418]
and with it is connected the expulsion of evil spirits--an example of the coalescence of festivals.
A peculiar feature in certain of these ceremonies is the exchange of places between masters
and servants; this abandonment of ordinary social distinctions is an expression of the desire
for freedom from all restraints, and is found in carnivals generally (in the Saturnalia and
elsewhere).[419]

+220+. Ceremonies of a serious character occur in connection with the eating of the first fruits
of the year. In developed cults (as in the Hebrew) the deity is recognized as the giver by
the presentation of a portion of the new crop.[420] In very early cults there are other procedures,
the origin and significance of which are not always clear. So far as the ceremonial eating,
a preliminary to general use, is concerned, this may be understood as a recognition, more or
less distinct, of some supernatural Power to whom (or to which) the supply of food is due.
The obscurest form of such recognition is found among the Australian Arunta.[421] The Nandi
practice is clearer--the god is invoked to bless the grain.[422] In the Creek Puskita (Busk)
there is perhaps a worship of the sun as the source of fertility.[423] Probably the element
of recognition of extrahuman power (the object being to secure its favor) is to be found in
all first-fruits ceremonies. A natural result of this recognition is that it is unlawful (that
is, dangerous) to partake of the new food till it has been properly offered to the deity. The
ceremonial features (such as the choice of the persons to make the offering) are simply the
carrying over of general social arrangements into religious observances--the ministrant is
the father of the family, or the chief of the tribe, or the priest or other elected person,
according to the particular local customs.

+221+. The sadness or gloom that sometimes attaches to these ceremonies has been variously
explained, and is due doubtless to various orders of ideas; it comes probably from the coalescence
of other cults with the agricultural cults proper. The remembrance of ancestors is not unnatural
at such a time, and sorrow may be expressed for their death; such is perhaps the case in the
Nandi usage mentioned above--the women sorrowfully take home baskets of elusine grain, and
the bits that drop in the house are left to the souls of the deceased. Sorrow appears also
in other agricultural seasons, as in the Roman Vestalia (in June) and the Greek Thesmophoria
(in the autumn), in which cases more likely it is connected with the fear of evil influences.[424]
So the great tribal purification of the Creeks, at the beginning of a new year, naturally coincides
with the gathering of the new crop.

+222+. A further extension of the conception of the sacredness of food (whether or not of the
first eating) appears in the Mexican custom (in May and December) of making dough images of
gods, the eating of which sanctifies the worshiper;[425] here the god dwells in the bread of
which he is the giver.

+223+. In addition to the astral and agricultural festivals above described there has been
the observance of long periods to which a religious significance was sometimes attached. The
Egyptian Sothis period[426] (of 1461 years), the Greek period of eight years (oktaeteris),
and the Mexican period of fifty-two years were calendary--attempts to harmonize the lunar and
solar years; in Mexico the new cycle introduced a new religious era--a great ceremony was held
in which domestic fires were rekindled from the sacred fires. The Hebrew jubilee period (of
fifty years), apparently a late development from the sabbatical year, was intended, among other
things, to maintain the division of landed property among the people--all alienated land was
to return finally to its original owner--participation in the blessings bestowed by the national
deity being conditioned on having a share in the land, of which he was held to be the proprietor;
the proposed arrangement turned out, however, owing to changed social conditions, to be impracticable.

+224+. It thus appears that ceremonies of various sorts have played a very important part in
religious life. They have been the most popularly effective presentation of religious ideas,
and they have preserved for us religious conceptions that without them would have remained
unknown. Their social character has insured their persistence[427]--ceremonies of to-day contain
features that go back to the earliest known stratum of organized religious life. While the
motives that underlie them (desire to propitiate supernatural Powers, demand for an objective
presentation of ideas, and love of amusement) are the same throughout the world, their forms
reflect the various climatic, economic, and general cultural conditions of clans, tribes, and
nations. They acquire consistency with the organization of society; they tend to become more
and more elaborate, just as in other points social intercourse tends to produce formal definiteness;
they grow decrepit and have to be artificially strengthened and revived; they lose their original
meanings and must be constantly reinterpreted to bring them into accord with new ideas, social,
moral, and religious. Their history, in a word, is the history of the development of human
ideas, and it sets forth the religious unity of the race. The selections given above are only
a small part of the known material, a full treatment of which would require a separate volume.

CHAPTER IV

EARLY CULTS

+225+. The lowest tribes known to us regard the whole world of nature and the human dead as
things to be feared and usually as things to be propitiated. In most cases they conceive of
some anthropomorphic being as the creator or arranger of the world. But in all cases they regard
animals, plants, and inanimate objects as capable of doing extraordinary things. All these
beings they think of as akin to men; transformations from human to nonhuman and from nonhuman
to human are believed to be possible and frequent.

+226+. From the point of view of the savage mind this theory of the world is inevitable. Ignorant
of what we call natural law, they can see no reason why the phenomena of life should not be
under the control of any of the powers known to them; and for sources of power they look to
the things around them. All objects of nature are mysterious to the savage--stones, hills,
waters, the sky, the heavenly bodies, trees, plants, fishes, birds, beasts, are full of movement,
and seemingly display capacities that induce the savage to see in them the causes of things.
Since their procedures seem to him to be in general similar to his own, he credits them with
a nature like his own. As they are mysterious and powerful, he fears them and tries to make
allies of them or to ward off their injurious influences.

+227+. But while he excludes nothing from his list of possible powers, he is vitally interested
only in those objects with which he comes into contact, and he learns their powers by his own
experience or through the wisdom inherited from his forefathers. His procedure is strictly
scientific; he adopts only what observation has shown him and others to be true. Different
tribes are interested in different things--some are indifferent to one thing, others to another,
according to the topographical and economic milieu. The savage is not without discrimination.
He is quite capable of distinguishing between the living and the dead. Not all stones are held
by him to be alive in any important sense, and not all beasts to be powerful. He is a practical
thinker and deals with each phenomenon as it presents itself, and particularly as it shows
itself to be connected with his interests. He is constantly on the alert to distinguish between
the profitable and the unprofitable, the helpful and the injurious. He himself is the center
of his whole scientific and religious system, and the categories into which he divides all
things are determined by his own sense of self-interest.[428]

+228+. It is often by accident that one object or another displays itself as helpful or harmful,
just as, in a later and higher form of religious belief, a theophany is often, as to time and
place, a matter of accident. Indeed, most manifestations of extrahuman power in the earliest
times may be said to come to man incidentally, since he does not generally demand them from
the gods or make experiments in order to discover them. But in the nature of the case many
things meet him as to which he is obliged to use judgment, and of these a certain number appear
to him to be powerful.

+229+. These objects are held by him to be in some sort akin to man. This seems to be his view
of certain dead things in which a mysterious power is held to reside. When such objects are
parts of animals (bones, feathers, claws, tails, feet, fat, etc.), or of vegetables that are
used as charms, it may be supposed that they simply retain the power resident in the objects
of which they are parts--objects originally living and sacred. In other cases an indwelling
supernatural being is assumed, as, for example, in minerals whose shape and color are remarkable.

+230+. Fetish objects in West Africa are believed to be inhabited by spirits.[429] The Australian
sacred object called churinga--a thing of mysterious potency--is believed to be the abode of
the soul of an ancestor endowed with extraordinary power. Many such fetish objects are found
all over the world.

+231+. Further, the conception of a life-force, existing in many things (perhaps in all things),
appears to have been prominent in savage religious systems. Life implies power; but while it
is held to reside in all things, its manifestations vary according to the relations between
things and human needs. The life-force in its higher manifestations has been isolated in thought
by some more advanced savages, especially in North America and Polynesia, and has been given
a definite name; in Polynesia and Melanesia it is called mana, and other names for it occur
elsewhere.[430]

+232+. It shows itself in any object, nonhuman or human, that produces extraordinary effects.
In the Pacific islands all great achievements of men are attributed to it--all great chiefs
possess it in an eminent degree;[431] it is then nearly equivalent to what we call capacity
or genius. When it resides in an inanimate thing it may produce a physical effect: it comes
up in the steam of the American sacred sweat lodge, and gives health to the body (and thus
buoyancy to the mind);[432] here it is identical with the soothing and stimulating power of
the steam. It is, in a word, a term for the force residing in any object.[433] Like sickness
and other evils, blessings, and curses, it is conceived of as having physical form and may
be transmitted from its possessor to another person or object. In some cases its name is given
to the thing to which it is attached.[434]

+233+. How widely the conception exists is uncertain; further research may discover it in regions
where up to now it has not been recognized. Scarcely a trace of it exists in the higher ancient
religions. The Latin genius, the indwelling power of the man, bears a resemblance to it. The
Old Testament "spirit of God" is said to "come on" a man or to be "poured out on" him, as if
it were a physical thing--it gives courage and strength to the warrior and knowledge to the
worshiper;[435] the power or energy is here (in the earlier Hebrew writings) identified with
the spirit or animus of the deity, which appears to be thought of as physical.

+234+. Mana is conceived of by the peoples mentioned above not as a vague influence diffused
through the world, but as a power resident in certain definite persons or things. It is impersonal
in the sense in which any quality, as courage, is impersonal, but it is not itself an object
of worship; worship is directed toward the thing that possesses or imparts mana. It may reside
in a natural object or in a supernatural being--the object will be used to secure it, the supernatural
being will be asked to bestow it. In both cases the act will be religious.

+235+. Mana is itself, strictly speaking, a scientific biological conception, but it necessarily
enters into alliance with religion. Belief in it exists along with belief in ghosts, spirits,
and gods--it is not a rival of these, but an attachment to them. As a thing desirable, it is
one of the good gifts that the great Powers can bestow, and it thus leads to worship. It is
found in distinct form, as is pointed out above, only in superior tribes--it has not been discovered
in very low communities, and appears not to belong to the earliest stratum of religious beliefs.
But it rests on the view that all things are endowed with life, and this view may be taken
to be universal. The doctrine of mana gradually vanishes before a better knowledge of the human
constitution,[436] a larger conception of the gods, and a greater trust in them.[437]

+236+. Things and persons endowed with peculiar power, whether as seats of mana or as abodes
of spirits, are set apart by themselves, are regarded with feelings of awe, and thus become
"sacred." In process of time the accumulated experience of generations builds up a mass of
sacred objects which become a part of the religious possessions of the community. The quality
of sacredness is sometimes attached to objects and customs when these are regarded as necessary
to the well-being of the community, or highly convenient. A house, for example, represents
the life of the family, and is therefore a thing to be revered; and in many tribes the walls,
which guard the house against intrusion, and the door and the threshold, which offer entrance
into it, are considered sacred; the hearth especially, the social center of the dwelling, becomes
a sacred place.

+237+. The savage communities with which we are acquainted all possess their stock of such
things--the beliefs concerning sacred objects are held by all the members of the tribe. The
development of the idea of 'sacred' is a social communal one, but it is impossible for us to
say precisely how all the individual sacred objects were selected, or what was the exact attitude
of primeval man toward all the things that are now regarded as sacred.

+238+. The conception of power resident in certain things to control human life is represented
by our term "luck." The formulation of "luck" systems goes on in savage and half-civilized
communities up to a certain point, and is then checked by the rise of higher religious ideas
and by the growth of the conception of natural law. But long after the grounds of belief in
luck have ceased to be accepted by the advanced part of the community, many individual forms
of good luck and bad luck maintain themselves in popular belief.[438] Some of these beliefs
may be traced back to their savage sources, especially those that are connected with animals;
the origin of most of them is obscure. They coalesce to some extent with conceptions derived
from magic, divination, and taboo. The persistence of such savage dogma into civilized times
enables us to understand how natural this dogma was for early forms of society.

+239+. In the practices mentioned above there is no worship proper. Mana is not thought of
as being in itself a personal power, and worship is paid only to objects regarded as having
personality. The fetish derives its value from the spirit supposed to be resident in the fetish
objects; these are commonly worn as charms, and the attitude of the man to such a charm, though
he regards it as powerful, seems to be not exactly that of worship--he keeps it as a protection
so long as it appears to be useful, but, as is remarked above, he acts as if he were its master.
He believes that the efficient factor is the indwelling spirit, but he commonly distinguishes
between this spirit and a god proper. When, however, the fetish is regarded as a tutelary divinity,
it loses its lower character and takes its place among the gods.

+240+. We turn now to man's attitude toward other objects, similarly regarded as sacred, but
invested with distinct personality, and supposed to act consciously on human life. These are
all such things as men's experiences bring them into intimate relations with, this relationship
forming the basis of the high regard in which they are held. They are animals, plants, mountains,
rivers, heavenly bodies, living men, and ghosts. These are objects of cults, many of them in
some cases being worshiped at the same time in a single community. A chronological order in
the adoption of such cults it is not possible to determine. All objects stand together in man's
consciousness in early cultural strata, and the data now at command do not enable us to say
which of them first assumed for him a religious character; the chronological order of cults
may have differed in different communities when the general social conditions were different.
We may begin with the cult of animals without thereby assuming that it came first in order of time.

ANIMALS

+241+. Of all nonhuman natural objects it would seem to have been the animal that most deeply
impressed early man.[439] All objects were potentially divine for him, and all received worship,
but none entered so intimately into his life as animals. He was doubtless struck, perhaps awed,
by the brightness of the heavenly bodies, but they were far off, intangible; mountains were
grand and mighty, but motionless; stones lay in his path, but did not approach him; rivers
ran, but in an unchanging way, rarely displaying emotion; plants grew, and furnished food,
but showed little sign of intelligence. Animals, on the other hand, dwelt with him in his home,
met him at every turn, and did things that seemed to him to exhibit qualities identical with
his own, not only physical but also mental--they showed swiftness, courage, ferocity, and also
skill and cunning. In certain regards they appeared to be his superiors, and thus became standards
of power and objects of reverence.

+242+. At a very early period the belief in social relations between men and animals appears.
The latter were supposed to have souls, to continue their existence after death, sometimes
to come to life on earth after death. Their social life was supposed to be similar to that
of men;[440] in Samoa the various species form social units,[441] the Ainu see tattoo marks
on frogs and sparrows,[442] the Arabs recognize a clan organization in beasts.[443]

+243+. From identity of nature comes the possibility of transformation and transmigration.[444]
An Australian of the Kangaroo clan explained that he might be called either kangaroo or man--it
was all the same, man-kangaroo or kangaroo-man, and the Australian legends constantly assume
change from human to animal and from animal to human.[445] The same belief appears in Africa
and North America, and may be assumed to be universal among savages. It survives in the Greek
transformation stories and in the werwolf and swan maiden of the European popular creed. It
is the basis of a part of the theory of the transmigration of souls.[446]

+244+. The relations of early man with animals are partly friendly, partly hostile. A friendly
attitude is induced by admiration of their powers and desire for their aid. Such an attitude
is presupposed in the myths of intermarriage between beasts and men. It is perhaps visible
also in the custom of giving or assuming names of animals as personal names of men, though
this custom may arise from the opinion that animals are the best expressions of certain qualities,
or from some conception underlying totemistic organization; the general history of savage proper
names has not yet been written. Beast tales, likewise, bear witness to man's opinion of the
cleverness or folly of his nonhuman brethren, and perhaps originally to nothing more. The distinctest
expression of friendliness is seen in certain religious customs spoken of below.

+245+. On the other hand, early man necessarily comes into conflict with animals. Against some
of them he is obliged to protect himself by force or by skillful contrivance; others must be
slain for food. With all of them he deals in such a way as to secure his own well-being, and
thus comes to regard them as things subservient to him, to be used in such way as he may find
profitable. Those that he cannot use he gradually exterminates, or, at a later stage, these,
banished to thickets, mountains, deserts, caves, and other inhospitable places, are excluded
from human society and identified with demons.[447]

+246+. The two attitudes, of friendliness and of hostility, coexist throughout the savage period,
and, in softened form, even in half-civilized life. They represent two points of view, both
of which issue from man's social needs. Early man is logical, but he comprehends the necessity
of not pushing logic too far--he is capable of holding at the same time two mutually contradictory
views, and of acting on each as may suit his convenience; he makes his dogma yield to the facts
of life (a saving principle not confined to savages, but acted on to a greater or less extent
by all societies). He slays sacred animals for divinatory and other religious purposes, for
food, or in self-defense; he fears their anger, but his fear is overcome by hunger; he offers
profuse apologies, explains that he acts without ill will and that the bones of the animal
will be preserved and honored, or he declares that it is not he but some one else that is the
slayer--but he does not hesitate to kill.[448]

+247+. This fact--the existence of different points of view--enables us to understand in part
the disrespectful treatment of sacred animals in folk-tales. Such tales are the product of
popular fancy, standing apart from the serious and solemn conceptions of the tribal religion.
The reciter, who will not fail at the proper time to pay homage to his tribal patron, does
not hesitate at other times to put him into ridiculous and disgraceful situations.[449]

+248+. Man's social contact with the lower animals is doubtless as old as man himself, but
there are no records of his earliest life, and it is not possible to say exactly when and how
his religious relations with them began. His attitude toward them; as is remarked above, was
a mixed one; in general, however, it may be assumed that constant intercourse with them revealed
their great qualities and impressed on him the necessity of securing their good will. This
was especially true of those of them that stood nearest to him and were of greatest importance
for his safety and convenience. These, invested with mystery by reason of their power and their
strangeness, were held in great respect as quasi-gods, were approached with caution, and thus
acquired the character of sacredness. Gradually, as human society was better and better organized,
as conceptions of government became clearer, and as the natures of the various animals were
more closely studied, means were devised of guarding against their anger and securing their
friendship and aid. Our earliest information of savage life reveals in every tribe an inchoate
pantheon of beasts. All the essential apparatus of public religion is present in these communities
in embryonic form--later movements have had for their object merely to clarify ideas and refine
procedures.

+249+. The animals revered by a tribe are those of its vicinage, the inhabitants of its hunting
grounds. Some of these man uses as food, some he fears. His relation to plains, mountains,
forests, lakes, rivers, and seas, influences his choice of sacred beasts. Usually there are
many of them, and the natural inference is that originally all animals are sacred, and that
gradually those most important for man are singled out as objects of special regard.

+250+. Thus, to mention the principal of them: in Africa we find lion, leopard, hyena, hippopotamus,
crocodile, bull, ram, dog, cat, ape, grasshopper; in Oceania, kangaroo, emu, pig, heron, owl,
rail, eel, cuttlefish; in Asia, lion, elephant, bear, horse, bull, dog, pig, eagle, tiger,
water wagtail, whale; in Europe, bear, wolf, horse, bull, goat, swan; in America, whale, bear,
wolf, fox, coyote, hare, opossum, deer, monkey, tiger, beaver, turtle, eagle, raven, various
fishes. The snake seems to have been generally revered, though it was sometimes regarded as
hostile.[450] Since animals are largely valued as food, changes in the animals specially honored
follow on changes in economic organization (hunting, pastoral, and agricultural stages).

+251+. Often animals are looked on as the abodes or incarnations of gods or spirits: so various
birds, fishes, and beasts in Polynesia (in Samoa every man has a tutelary deity, which appears
in the form of an animal[451]), Siberia, Mexico, and elsewhere. In other cases they are revered
as incarnations of deceased men.[452] Where a species of animal is supposed to represent a
god, this view is probably to be regarded not as a generalization from an individualistic to
a specific conception (a process too refined for savages), but as an attempt to carry over
to the animal world the idea of descent from a common ancestor combined with the idea of a
special creator for every family of animals.[453]

+252+. In the course of religious growth the beast-god may be replaced or succeeded by an anthropomorphic
god, and then the former is regarded as sacred to the latter--the recollection of the beast
form still remains after the more refined conception has been reached, and the two, closely
connected in popular feeling, can be brought into harmony only by making one subordinate to
the other.[454] A certain element or flavor of divinity clings to the beast a long time, but
finally vanishes under the light of better knowledge.

+253+. While the cases, very numerous, in which animals are associated in worship with gods--in
composite forms (as in Egypt, Babylonia, and Assyria) or as symbols of deities or sacred to
them--point probably to early beast-cults, Egypt alone of the ancient civilized nations maintained
the worship of the living animal.[455] For the better thinkers of Egypt beasts doubtless were
incarnations or symbols of deities; but the mass of the people appear to have regarded them
as gods in their own persons.

+254+. Reverence for animals persists in attenuated form in civilized nations in various superstitions
connected with them. Their appearances and their cries are believed to portend success or disaster.
The great number of "signs" recognized and relied on by uneducated and educated persons at
the present day bear witness to the strong hold that the cult of animals had on early man.[456]

+255+. It is in keeping with early ideas that savages often, perhaps generally, ascribe the
creation or construction of the world (so far as they know it) to animals. The creation (whether
by beasts or by other beings) is not conceived of as produced out of nothing; there is always
preëxisting material, the origin of which is not explained; primitive thought seems not to
have considered the possibility of a situation in which nothing existed. The "creation" conceived
of is the arrangement of existing material into the forms familiar to man--every tribe accounting
thus for its own environment. The origin of the land, of mountains, defiles, lakes, rivers,
trees, rocks, sun, moon, and stars, wind and rain, human beings and lower animals, and sometimes
of social organizations and ceremonies, is explained in some way natural to the thought of
the time and place. Not all these details occur in the cosmogony of every tribe or clan, but
the purpose of every cosmogony is to account for everything in the origin of which the people
are interested.

+256+. The creator in the cosmogonies known to us is not always an animal--he is sometimes
a man, sometimes a god; it is possible, however, that human and divine creators are the successors
of original animal creators. In Central Australia the production of certain natural features
of the country and the establishment of certain customs are ascribed to ancestors, mythical
beings of the remote past, creatures both animal and human, or rather, either animal or human--possibly
animals moving toward the anthropomorphic stage.[457] However this may be, there are instances
in which the creator is an animal pure and simple, though, of course, endowed with extraordinary
powers. The beast to which the demiurgic function is assigned is selected, it would seem, on
the ground of some peculiar skill or other power it is supposed to possess; naturally the reason
for the choice is not always apparent. For the Ainu the demiurge is the water wagtail;[458]
for the Navahos and in California,[459] the coyote or prairie wolf; among the Lenni-Lenâpé,
the wolf.[460] Various animals--as elephants, boars, turtles, snakes--are supposed to bear
the world on their backs. The grounds of such opinions, resting on remote social conditions,
are obscure.

+257+. Though, in early stadia of culture, animals are universally revered as in a sort divine,
there are few recorded instances of actual worship offered them.[461] Whether the Bushmen and
the Hottentots worship the mantis (the Bushman god Cagn) as animal is not quite clear.[462]
The bear, when it is ceremonially slain, is treated by the Ainu as divine--it is approached
with food and prayer, but only for the specific purpose of asking that it will speak well of
them to its divine kin and will return to earth to be slain. The Zuñi cult of the turtle and
the Californian worship of the bird called panes[463] present similar features. The non-Aryan
Santhals of Bengal are said to offer divine worship to the tiger.[464] Such worship appears
to be paid to the snake by the Naga tribes and the Gonds of India, and by the Hopi of North
America.[465]

+258+. In these and similar cases it is sometimes difficult to say whether the animal is worshiped
in its own person merely, or as the embodiment or representative of a god or of ancestors.
The usages in question are almost entirety confined to low tribes, and disappear with the advance
of civilization; wild animals are banished from society and cease to be sacred, and the recollection
of their early character survives only in their mythological attachment to deities proper.
For a different reason domesticated animals lose their sacredness--they become merely servants
of men. The Egyptian cult of the bull is the best-attested instance of actual worship of a
domestic animal, and parallels to this it is hard to find; the Todas, for example, for whom
the buffalo is the central sacred object, do not now pay worship to the animal--they may have
done so in former times.

+259+. The sacredness of animals, and the fact that they are regarded as embodying the souls
of things and human beings, have led to a coalescence of their cults with other religious observances.
They are abundantly employed in magical procedures and in sacrifices; they are often identified
with spirits of vegetation, any locally revered animal being chosen for this purpose; they
are brought into connection with astral objects and their forms are fancifully seen in sun,
moon, and constellations; they play a great rôle in apotropaic and purificatory ceremonies;
and they appear in myths of all sorts,[466] especially in the histories of gods.

+260+. But, though they are in many cases regarded as tutelary beings, it is doubtful whether
they ever develop into anthropomorphic deities.[467] The creation of such deities followed
a different line[468] and dispensed with the lower quasi-divine forms. Such manlike attributes
as beasts were supposed to have were taken up into the distincter and nobler conceptions of
tribal gods to whom beasts were more and more subordinated. The latter were allegorized and
spiritualized, and came to serve merely as material for poetry.

+261+. Yet beast worship, such as it was and is, has played an important part in religious
development. It has furnished a point of crystallization for early ideas, and has supplied
interesting objects in which man's demand for superhuman companionship could find satisfaction.[469]
It has disappeared when it has been no longer needed.

PLANTS

+262+. The cult of plants has been as widespread as that of animals, and, if its rôle in the
history of religion has been less important than that of the latter, this is because plants
show less definite signs of life than animals and enter less intimately than they into the
social interests of man. But, like all other things, they are regarded by early man as living,
as possessing a nature similar to that of man, and as having power to work good or ill. Trees
are represented as thinking, speaking, entering into marriage relations, and in general doing
whatever intelligent beings can do. Through thousands of years in the period before the dawn
of written history man was brought into constant contact with the vegetable world, and learned
by experience to distinguish between plants that were beneficial and those that were harmful.
His observation created an embryonic science of medicine, and his imagination an embryonic
religious cult.

+263+. The value of certain vegetable products (fruits, nuts, wild plants) as food must have
become known at a very early time, and these would naturally be offered to the extrahuman Powers.
At a later time, when cereals were cultivated, they formed an important part of sacrificial
offerings, and were held--as, for example, among the Greeks and the Hebrews--to have piacular
efficacy.

+264+. Among the discoveries of the early period was that of the intoxicating quality of certain
plants--a quality that came to play a prominent rôle in religious life. Valued at first, probably,
for the agreeable sensations they produced, such plants were later supposed to possess magical
power, to exert a mysterious influence on the mind, and to be the source or medium of superhuman
communications. Thus employed by magicians they were connected with the beginnings of religious
ecstasy and prophecy. Their magical power belongs to them primarily as living things, but came
to be attributed to extrahuman beings.

+265+. Plants as living things were supposed to possess souls.[470] Probably the soul was conceived
of at first as simply the vital principle, and the power of the plant was thought of as similar
to the power of an animal or any other living thing. In the course of time this soul, the active
principle, was distinguished from the vital principle, was isolated and regarded as an independent
being dwelling in the plant. To it all the powers of the latter were ascribed, and it became
a friend or an enemy, an object of worship or of dread.[471]

+266+. This difference of attitude on man's part toward different plants probably showed itself
at an early period. Those that were found to be noxious he would avoid; the useful he would
enter into relations with, though on this point for very early times there is in the nature
of the case little information.[472] Unfriendly or demonic spirits of plants are recognized
by savage man in certain forests whose awe-inspiring gloom, disease-breeding vapors, and wild
beasts repel and frighten him. Demons identified with plants or dwelling in them are of the
same nature as animal demons, and have been dealt with in the same way as these.[473]

+267+. The progress of society brought men into association with useful plants, such as medicinal
and edible herbs, and fruit-bearing and shade-giving trees; these, conceived of as inhabited
by anthropomorphic spirits, fulfilled all the functions that attach to friendly animals. They
became guardians and allies, totems and ancestors.[474] Several of the Central Australian totems
are plants, and form part of the mythical ancestral population constructed by the imagination
or ethnographic science of the people.[475] In Samoa a plant is often the incarnation of a
spirit friendly to a particular family[476]--a conception that is not improbably a development
from an earlier view that a certain plant had a special relation to a certain clan.[477] In
general, a plant important in a given region (as, for example, the tobacco plant in North America)
is likely to be invested with a sacred character.

+268+. Trees, by reason of their greater dignity (size, beauty, protective character), have
generally been singled out as special cultic centers.[478] A great tree sometimes served as
a boundary mark or signpost; under trees chiefs of clans sat to decide disputes. Thus invested
with importance as a sort of political center as well as the abode of a spirit, a tree naturally
became a shrine and an asylum.[479] In India and Greece, and among the ancient Celts and Germans,
the gods were worshiped in groves, by the Canaanites and Hebrews "under every green tree."
To cut down a sacred tree was a sacrilege, and the spirit of the tree was believed to avenge
the crime.[480]

+269+. As might be expected, there is hardly a species of tree that has not been held sacred
by some group of men. The Nagas and other tribes of Northeast India regard all plants as sacred,[481]
and every village has its sacred tree. In Babylonia and Assyria, it is said, there were hundreds
of trees looked on as invested with more or less sanctity. The oak was revered in some parts
of Greece, and among the Romans and the Celts. The cult of particular species, as the pipal
(Ficus religiosa), the vata or banyan (Ficus Indica), the karam and others, has been greatly
systematized in India.[482]

+270+. Vegetable spirits in some cases have developed into real gods. A notable example of
such growth is furnished by the history of the intoxicating soma plant, which in the Rig-Veda
is represented not only as the inspiring drink of the gods but as itself a deity, doing things
that are elsewhere ascribed to Indra, Pushan, and other well-established deities.[483] The
spirit, coming to be regarded as an anthropomorphic person, under peculiar circumstances assumes
the character of a god. A similar development appears in the Iranian haoma, and the cultic
identity of soma and haoma shows that the deification of the plant took place in the early
Aryan period.[484]

+271+. Another example has been supposed to be furnished by corn-spirits. The importance of
cereal crops for human life gave them a prominent position in the cult of agricultural communities.
The decay and revival of the corn was an event of prime significance, and appears to have been
interpreted as the death and resurrection of the spirit that was the life of the crop. Such
is the idea in the modern popular customs collected by Mannhardt and Frazer.[485] The similarity
between these ceremonies and those connected with the Phoenician Tammuz (Adonis) and the Phrygian
Attis makes it probable that the two are based on the same ideas; that is, that Adonis and
Attis (and so also Osiris and Ishtar) were deities of vegetation. This, however, does not prove
that they were developed out of spirits of vegetation; they may have been deities charged with
the care of crops.[486] The Phoenician name Adon is merely a title ('lord') that might be given
to any god; he whom the Greeks called Adonis was a Syrian local deity, identical in origin
with the Babylonian Tammuz, and associated in worship with Astarte, whom the Greeks identified
with their Aphrodite.

+272+. A sacred tree often stood by a shrine; that is, probably, the shrine was put in the
spot made sacred by a tree, and a ritual connection between the two was thus established. Later,
when a shrine for any reason (in consequence of a theophany, for example) was built where there
was no tree, its place was supplied by a wooden post, which inherited the cultic value of a
sacred tree. In the Canaanite cult, which was adopted by the Hebrews, the sacred post (called
"ashera") stood by the side of every shrine, and was denounced by the prophets as an accompaniment
of foreign (that is, non-Yahwistic) worship.[487] The transition from tree to post is illustrated,
perhaps, by the conventionalized form of trees frequent on Babylonian seal cylinders.[488]
How far the sacred post was an object of worship by the people we have no means of knowing;
but by the more intelligent, doubtless, it came to be regarded simply as a symbol, a sign of
the presence of a deity, and was, in so far, in the same category with images.[489]

+273+. It is not impossible that totem posts may be connected with original totem trees or
other sacred trees. A tree as totem would naturally be the object of some sort of cult, and
when it took the form of a post or pole, would have totemic symbols carved on it. Oftener,
probably, it was the sacred pole of a village (itself descended from a sacred tree) that would
be adorned with totemic figures, as among the Indians of Northwestern America.[490] In all
such cases there is a coalescence of totemism and tree worship.

+274+. It was natural in early times, when most men lived in forests, which supplied all their
needs, that trees should be looked on as intimately connected with human life. A tree might
be regarded as in itself an independent personality, having, of course, a body and a soul,
but not as dependent on an isolated spirit. A group of men might think itself descended from
a tree--a conception that may have been widespread, though there is little direct evidence
of its existence.[491] Indirect evidence of such a view is found in the custom of marrying
girls to trees,[492] and in the belief in "trees of life," which are sometimes connected with
individual men in such a way that when the tree or a part of it is destroyed the man dies,
as in the case of Meleager whose life depended on the preservation of a piece of wood,[493]
the representative, probably, of a tree, and the priest of Nemi whose life was bound up in
the "golden bough"[494]; sometimes the tree has a magical power of conferring life on whoever
eats of its fruit, as in the case of the tree of Eden.[495]

+275+. These stories involve the conception of blood-kinship between man and tree. Closely
related to the "tree of life" is the "tree of knowledge"--life is knowledge and knowledge is
life. In the original form of the story in Genesis there was only one tree--the tree of the
knowledge of good and evil[496]--whose fruit, if eaten, made one the equal of the gods;[497]
that is, the tree (in the original form of the conception, in remote times) was allied in nature
(that is, in blood) to gods and to men, so that whoever partook of its substance shared its
attribute of knowledge in sharing its life, and the command not to eat of it was due apparently
to Yahweh's unwillingness that man should equal the gods in knowledge. The serpent-god, who
belongs to the inner divine circle, but for some unexplained reason is hostile to the god of
the garden,[498] reveals the secret.

+276+. Probably, also, it is from this general order of ideas that the conception of the cosmic
tree has sprung. The Scandinavian Yggdrasil is the source of life to all things and represents
also wisdom; though the details may contain Christian elements, the general conception of the
world as a tree or as nourished by a tree is probably old.[499] The same conception appears
in the cosmic tree of India.[500] Such quasi-philosophical ideas of the unity of the life of
the world suppose, doubtless, a relatively advanced stage of culture, but they go back to the
simple belief that the tree is endowed with life and is a source of life for men. The transition
to the cosmic conception may be found in those quasi-divine trees that grant wishes and endow
their friends with wisdom and life.

+277+. The divinatory function of trees follows as a matter of course from their divine nature
(whether this was regarded as innate or as due to an indwelling spirit). Their counsel was
supposed to be expressed by the rustling of their leaves,[501] or in some way that was interpreted
by priests or priestesses (as at Dodona and elsewhere) or by diviners (so, perhaps, the Canaanite
"terebinth of the diviners").[502] The predictions of the Cumæan sibyl were said to be written
on leaves that were whirled away by the wind and had to be gathered and interpreted. To what
method of divination this points is not clear--possibly to supposed indications in the markings
of the leaves; it may, however, be merely an imaginative statement of the difficulty of discovering
the sibyl's meaning.[503]

+278+. The passage from the conception of the tree as a divine thing or person (necessarily
anthropomorphic) to the view that it was the abode of a spirit was gradual, and it is not always
easy to distinguish the two stages one from the other. The tree-spirits, in the nature of the
case very numerous, were not distinguished by individual names, as the trees were not so distinguished.[504]
The spirits resident in the divine trees invoked in the Vedas are powerful, but have not definite
personality, and it is hard to say whether it is the tree or the spirit that is worshiped.
The Indian tree-spirits called Nagas appear to be always nameless, and are not mentioned in
the list of deities that pay reverence to the Buddha (in the Maha Samaya).[505] The large number
of trees accounted sacred in Babylonia were doubtless believed to be inhabited by spirits,
but to no one of these is a name given.

+279+. Thus the divine tree with its nameless spirit stands in a class apart from that of the
gods proper. A particular tree, it is true, may be connected with a particular god, but such
a connection is generally, if not always, to be traced (as in the parallel case of animals[506])
to an accidental collocation of cults. When a deity has become the numen of a tribe, his worship
will naturally coalesce with the veneration felt by the tribe for some tree, which will then
be conceived of as sacred to the god. Such, doubtless, was the history of the oak of Dodona,
sacred to Zeus; when Zeus was established as deity of the place, the revered tree had to be
brought into relation with him, and this relation could only be one of subordination--the tree
became the medium by which the god communicated his will. There was then no need of the spirit
of the tree, which accordingly soon passed away; the tree had lost its spiritual divine independence.
The god who is said to have appeared to Moses in a burning bush, and is described as dwelling
in the bush, is a local deity, the numen loci later identified with Yahweh, or called an angel.[507]
That a tree is sacred to a god means only that it has a claim to respect based on its being
the property or instrument of a god.

+280+. While the tree-spirit has undoubtedly played a great rôle in early religious history,
there is not decisive evidence of its ever having developed into a true god, with name, distinct
personality, and distinct functions.[508] There are many Greek and Roman titles that connect
gods with trees,[509] but these may be explained in the way suggested above: Zeus Endendros
is a god dwelling in a tree, but the tree is only an abode, not a god, and the god Zeus does
not come from the tree--rather two distinct sacred things have been brought together and fused
into a unity, or the tree is a rude, incipient image. The Dionysos Hermes-figures may be explained
in the same way.[510]

+281+. It appears to be the aloofness of trees that prevents their becoming gods; they are
revered and worshiped, but without becoming personalities. Babylonian seal engravings and wall
pictures often represent a tree before which men or higher beings stand in adoration; according
to Maspero[511] there was actual worship of trees in Egypt, and similar cults are found among
the wild tribes of India.[512] Adoration, however, does not necessarily imply a god; the Buddhist's
worship under the bo-tree is not directed to any being; it is only the recognition of something
that he thinks worthy of reverence.[513]

+282+. The cult of the corn-spirit is referred to above,[514] and doubt is there expressed
as to whether such a spirit has grown into a true god. The question is confessedly a difficult
one on account of the absence of full data for the period involved. The chief ground for the
doubt as to the development in question lies in what we know of early gods. The term 'Adon,'
as is remarked above, is the Phoenician title of the local deity. The origin of such deities
is involved in the obscurity of the remote past, but they are, each in his community, universal
powers; their functions embrace all that their communities desire, and they represent each
the total life of a people. It is the general rule that any popular custom may be introduced
into the cult of the local god; of such sort of procedure there are many examples. In the case
under consideration the god may have become the hero of a ceremony with which he had originally
nothing to do, as the Hebrews when they entered Canaan connected Canaanite festivals with their
national god, Yahweh, and later a cult of the wilderness deity Azazel[515] was adopted and
modified by the Yahwist leaders. Various cults attached themselves to the worship of Zeus,
Apollo, Dionysos, and other Greek deities.[516]

+283+. A similar explanation may be given of the ceremonies of death and resurrection connected
with Attis and Osiris. Of Attis we have only late accounts, and do not know his early history.
Osiris is an old underground deity (later the judge of the Underworld), with functions that
included more than the vivification of vegetation, and the absorption of the corn-spirit into
his cult would be natural. The collocation of a male with a female deity, common to the three
cults, may be merely the elaboration of the myth in accordance with human social usage (the
dead deity is mourned by his consort).[517] The descent of Ishtar has been interpreted of the
weakening of the sun's heat in winter; but as she is obviously a deity of fertility and, in
her descent, disappears entirely from among men, while the sun does not disappear entirely,
she rather, in this story, represents or is connected with the decay and rebirth of vegetation.

+284+. It is thus possible that, though many ancient ceremonies stand in relation to the corn-spirit
and also to a god, the explanation of this fact is not that the spirit has grown into a god,
but that it has coalesced with a god. In all such explanations, however, our ignorance of the
exact processes of ancient thought must be borne in mind.

+285+. Trees have been widely credited with the power of bestowing blessings of all sorts.
But, like animals, they rarely receive formal worship;[518] the reason for this is similar
to that suggested above[519] in the case of animals. The coalescence, spoken of above, of tree
ceremonies with cults of fully developed gods is not uncommon, and trees figure largely in
mythical divine histories.

STONES AND MOUNTAINS

+286+. Like all other objects stones have been regarded, in all parts of the world, as living,
as psychologically anthropomorphic (that is, as having soul, emotion, will), and, in some cases,
as possessing superhuman powers.[520] The term 'sacred,' as applied to them, may mean either
that they are in themselves endowed with peculiar powers, or that they have special relations
with divine beings; the first meaning is the earlier, the second belongs to a period when the
lesser revered objects have been subordinated to the greater.

+287+. The basis of the special belief in their sacredness was, probably, the mystery of their
forms and qualities, their hardness, brilliancy, solidity. They seem to have been accepted,
in the earliest known stages of human life, as ultimate facts. When explanations of their presence
were sought, they were supposed to have been deposited by ancestors or other beings, sometimes
as depositories of their souls.[521] Meteorites, having fallen from the sky, needed no other
explanation. Popular science (that is, popular imagination), perhaps from fancied resemblances
to the human form, assumed of some stones that they were human beings turned to stone, and
stories grew up to account for the metamorphoses. In many different ways, according to differences
of physical surroundings and of social conceptions, men accounted for such of these objects
as interested them particularly.

+288+. That stones were believed to be alive and akin to men is shown by the stories of the
birth of men and gods from stones,[522] the turning of human beings to stone (Niobe, Lot's
wife), the accounts of their movements (rocks in Brittany).[523]

+289+. Small stones, especially such as are of peculiar shape, are in many parts of the world
regarded as having magic power; the peculiarity of shape seems mysterious and therefore connected
with power. Doubtless accidental circumstances, such as the occurrence of a piece of good fortune,
have often endowed a particular stone with a reputation for power. Certain forms, especially
flat disks with a hole in the center, have preserved this reputation down to the present day.
The Roman lapis manalis is said by Festus to have been employed to get rain.[524]

+290+. Magical stones were, doubtless, believed to possess souls. In accordance with the general
law such stones and others were regarded later as the abodes of independent movable spirits.[525]
When the power of a fetish seems to be exhausted, and a new object is chosen and by appropriate
ceremonies a spirit is induced to take up its abode in it, there seems to be no theory as to
whether the incoming spirit is the old one or a new one, or, if it be a new one, what becomes
of the old one, about which little or no interest is felt.[526] The pneumatology is vague;
the general view is that the air is full of spirits, whose movements may be controlled by magical
means: spirits, that is, are subject to laws, and these laws are known to properly trained men.

+291+. Reverence for divine stones continues into the period of the rise of the true gods.
When god and stone stand together in a community, both revered, they may be and generally are
combined into a cultic unity: the stone becomes the symbol or the abode or the person of the
god.[527] It was, doubtless, in some such way as this that a stone came to be identified with
the Magna Mater of Pessinus. When this stone was brought to Rome toward the end of the Second
Punic War, the Roman leaders may have regarded it simply as a symbol of the goddess, but the
people probably looked on it as itself a divine defense against Hannibal.[528] The Israelite
ark, carried out to the battle against the Philistines,[529] appears to have contained a stone,
possibly a meteorite, possibly a piece taken from the sacred mountain Sinai, itself divine,
but in the Old Testament narrative regarded as the abode of Yahweh (a Sinaitic god), though
it was probably of independent origin and only gradually brought into association with the
local god of the mountain.

+292+. Similar interpretations may be given of other stones identified or connected with deities,
as that of Zeus at Seleucia,[530] that of Aphrodite at Paphos,[531] that of Jupiter Lapis,[532]
and the black stone that represented the Syrian Elagabalos at Emesa.[533] The remark of Pausanias,
after he has described the thirty sacred stones of Pheræ, that the early Greeks paid divine
honors to unhewn stones, doubtless expresses the traditions and beliefs of his time;[534] and
it is probable that in antiquity there were many divine stones, and that these were frequently
in later times identified with local gods. In many cases, however, there was no identification,
only a collocation and subordination: the stone became the symbol of the deity, or a sacred
object associated with the deity.[535]

+293+. This seems to be the later conception of the character of the sacred stones mentioned
in the Old Testament, as the one that Jacob is said to have set up as a masseba and anointed.[536]
The Canaanite massebas, adopted as cultic objects by the Israelites,[537] were stone pillars
standing by shrines and regarded as a normal if not a necessary element of worship; originally
divine in themselves (as may be inferred from the general history of such objects), they came
to be regarded as mere accessories; there is no indication in the Old Testament that they were
looked on as gods, though they may have been so regarded by the people[538]--their presence
at the Canaanite shrines, as a part of foreign, non-Yahwistic worship, sufficiently explains
the denunciation of them by the prophets.[539]

+294+. In the story of Jacob he is said to have given the name Bethel to the place where he
anointed the stone. It does not appear that he so called the stone itself; Bethel (in Hebrew,
"house of God"[540]) seems to have been an old sacred place, and terms compounded with 'beth'
in Hebrew are names of shrines. The relation between this name and the Semitic word whence,
probably, comes Greek baitulos[541] (Latin baetulus) is not clear; this last is the designation
of a sacred stone held to have fallen from heaven (meteoric). Such an one is called by Philo
of Byblos "empsuchos," 'endowed with life or with soul.'[542] Pliny describes the baetulus
as a species of ceraunia (thunderstone).[543] The Greek word is now commonly derived from betel
('bethel')--a derivation possible so far as the form of the word is concerned.[544] According
to this view the stone is the abode of a deity--a conception common in early religion. Such
an object would be revered, and would ultimately be brought into connection with a local god.[545]
If Hebrew bethel was originally a stone considered as the abode of a deity, then in the Old
Testament the earlier form of the conception has been effaced by the later thought--the word
'bethel' has become the name of a place, a shrine, the dwelling place of God.[546]

+295+. The origin of the black stone of the Kaaba at Mecca is unknown--it was doubtless either
a meteorite or in some way connected with a sacred place; it was, and is, regarded as in itself
sacred, but whether it represented originally a deity, and if so what deity, is not known.[547]

+296+. The belief in the sacred character of stones may account, at least in part, for the
custom of casting stones on the grave of a chieftain (as in Northern Arabia), though this may
be merely intended to preserve the grave. So also the stones thrown at the foot of a Hermes
pillar may have been meant as a waymark, yet with the feeling that the stone heap had a sacred
character of its own.[548] The stone circles at Stonehenge and Avebury may have had a religious
significance, but their function is not clear. Boundary stones seem to have had at first simply
a political function, but were naturally dedicated to the deities who were guardians of tribal
boundaries (Roman Terminus, various Babylonian gods, etc.).

+297+. It is by virtue of their divine character that stones came to be used as altars.[549]
As things divine in themselves or as representing a deity they receive the blood of the sacred
(that is, divine) sacrificial animal, which is the food of the god. Originally a part of the
blood is applied to the stone, and the rest poured out or eaten (as sacred food) by the worshiper.
In process of time, when the god has been divorced from the stone, the latter becomes a table
on which the victim is offered;[550] the old conception survives in the custom of slaying the
victim by the side of the altar, and applying the blood to the horns of the altar as a representative
part of the sacred structure. In the late Jewish ritual this application of blood is interpreted
as a purification of the altar from ceremonial defilements.[551]

+298+. Originally, it seems, it was only natural stones that were sacred or divine and were
employed as representatives of deities; but by a natural process of thought the custom arose
of using artificial stones in the same way. By means of certain ceremonies, it was held, the
deity could be induced to accept an altar or a house, or to take up his abode in an image,
as a spirit is introduced by the savage into a fetish object.[552] The basis of this sort of
procedure is first the belief in the amenableness of the deity to magical laws, and, later,
the belief in his friendly disposition, his willingness to accede to the wishes of his worshipers
provided they offer the proper tribute; but even in very late ceremonies a trace of the magical
element remains.

+299+. The significance of the high pillars, of stone or of metal, that stood at the entrance
of certain Semitic temples, is not clear. Examples are: in Tyre, the temple of the local Baal
(Melkart);[553] Solomon's temple of Yahweh in Jerusalem, and the temple planned by Ezekiel
in imitation of that of Solomon;[554] compare the temple of the Carthaginian Tanit-Artemis,
a form of Ashtart, the votive stela from the temple of Aphrodite in Idalium (in Cyprus), and
similar figures on Cyprian coins.[555] Of the various explanations offered of these pillars
that which regards them as phallic symbols may be set aside as lacking proof.[556] It is not
probable that they were merely decorative; the details of ancient temples, as a rule, were
connected with worship. It has been suggested that they were fire altars,[557] in support of
which view may be cited the figures on Cyprian coins (mentioned above), and the fact that sailors
sacrificed at Gades at a place where there were two high pillars;[558] but such a custom does
not prove that the sacrifices were offered on the pillars, and these latter are generally too
high to serve such a purpose; they are too high also to be convenient candelabra.[559] It seems
more probable that they were developments from sacred stones (such as the Canaanite massebas),
which originally represented the deity, came to be conventional attachments to temples, and
then were treated in accordance with architectural principles. They would be placed in pairs,
one pillar on each side of the temple door, for the sake of symmetry, and dignity would be
sought by giving them a considerable height.[560] They might also be utilized, when they were
not too high, as stands for lamps or cressets, but this would be a secondary use. The obelisks
that stood in front of Egyptian temples, likewise, were probably sacred monuments reared in
honor of deities.[561]

+300+. Images of gods and other extrahuman beings arise through the natural human impulse to
represent familiar objects of thought. Very rude tribes have stone or wood carvings of spirits
and gods, good and bad. These images are generally in human shape, because all Powers are thought
of as anthropomorphic. Sometimes, as Réville suggests, a root, or branch of a tree, bearing
some resemblance to the human face or figure, may have led to the making of an image; but the
general natural artistic tendency is sufficient to account for the fact.[562]

+301+. The character assigned to images varies with stages of culture. In low communities they
are themselves divine--the gods have entered into them and they are not thought of as different
from their divine indwellers. In such cases they are sometimes chained to prevent their getting
away; if they are obstinate, not listening to prayers, they are cuffed, scourged, or reviled.[563]
This conception lingers still among the peasants of Southern Europe, who treat a saint (a rechristened
old god) as if he were a man to be won by threats or cajolements. In a more refined age the
image becomes simply a symbol, a visible representation serving to fix the attention and recall
divine things. Different races also differ in the extent of their demand for such representations
of deity.

+302+. Stones and rocks, like other natural objects, are starting-points for folk-stories and
myths. All over the world they lie on the ground or rise in the shape of hills, and, being
mysterious, require explanation. The explanations given, and handed down from generation to
generation, are always connected with superhuman or with extraordinary persons, ancestors,
heroes, spirits. To each stone or rock a story is attached, a creation of the fancy suggested
by the surroundings and by the popular traditions; and each story forms an episode in the history
of the hero or spirit. The stones and rocks thus come to constitute a book chronicling the
history of the tribe and the deeds of its great men--a book quite legible to the man who has
been taught the stories. These grow with every generation, receiving such additions as fancy
and reflection dictate, and gradually taking on literary form. In the territory of the Australian
Arunta every stone is connected with some incident in the careers of the mythical ancestors,
and the stories taken together form the legendary history of the origin of customs.[564] In
Samoa and New Guinea many stones are pointed out as having been set in place by local heroes.
In North America innumerable rocks and stones are connected with the mythical ancestors and
creators of the tribes.

+303+. Mountains have everywhere been regarded as abodes of spirits or deities, and therefore
sacred. Their height and massiveness invested them with dignity (even as now they appeal mightily
to the imagination), and their lofty summits and rugged sides were full of danger and mystery.
Sacred mountains are found in North America, Bengal, Africa, and elsewhere. Naturally they
are often abodes of gods of rain; they are feared on account of the spirits inhabiting them,
but they are also resorted to as places where divine revelations may be obtained.[565] The
Semitic, Hindu, and Greek examples are familiar: the Hebrew and Canaanite Sinai (or Horeb),
Nebo, Carmel, Hermon; the Arabian Arafat, near Mecca; the Babylonian Ekur; in India, Meru,
Mandara, Himavat, and other mountains; in Greece, Olympus and Parnassus.

+304+. Mountains are also worshiped as being themselves divine.[566] The cult, however, has
not been important; the physical mass is too solid, lacking in movement, and human interest
naturally centered in the spirit or deity who dwelt therein.[567]

+305+. Mythological fancy has made them the abodes and places of assembly of gods and glorified
saints, usually in the north. The mythical Ekur was the dwelling place of Babylonian deities.[568]
In India various peaks in the Himalayas, inaccessible to men, were assigned to groups of deities,
and the mythical world-mountain Meru was the special abode of great gods, who there lived lives
of delight.[569] On the highest peak of the Thessalian Olympus Zeus sat, surrounded by the
inferior gods; here he held councils and announced his decrees.[570] The two conceptions of
the home of the gods--on mountains and in the sky--existed for a time side by side, having
in common the feature of remoteness and secrecy; gradually the earthly abode was ignored, and
the gods were assigned to the more dignified heavenly home.

WATERS

+306+. To early man waters, fire, winds, are interesting because of their relation to his life,
and sacred because of their power and mysteriousness.[571] They are regarded by him not as
"elements" of the world, but as individual phenomena that affect well-being. His conception
of them is not cosmogonic or analytic, but personal; they are entities with which he has to deal.

+307+. The mobility of masses of water, seeming to be a sign of life, naturally procured them
a definite place among sacred things. Any spring, pond, lake, or river with which a tribe was
brought into intimate relations was regarded as a source of life or of healing, and of divination.
Dwellers by the sea regarded it with awe; its depths were mysterious and its storms terrible.

+308+. As in the case of animals, plants, and stones, so here: the earliest conception of water
masses is that they are divine in themselves (every one, of course, having its own soul), and
are potent for bodily help or harm, and for divination. The waters of the Nile, the Ganges,
the Jordan, were held to heal the diseased and purify the unclean; and a similar power is now
ascribed to the water of the well Zamzam in the Kaaba at Mecca. Hannibal swore, among other
things, by the waters,[572] and the oath by the river Styx was the most binding of oaths, having
power to control even the gods; the thing by which an oath is taken is always originally divine.
In the Hebrew ordeal of jealousy the sacred water decides whether the accused woman is guilty
or not.[573] The sea is treated as a living thing, whose anger may be appeased by gifts; it
is a monster, a dragon.[574] The Spartan Cleomenes, about to start on a voyage, sacrifices
a bull to the sea.[575] Offerings to the sea are made in the Maldive Islands.[576]

+309+. Water is abundantly employed in religious ritual as a means of purification from ceremonial
defilement, and in services of initiation. A bathing-place often stood by a shrine (as in pre-Islamic
Arabia and in Islam now), and immersions came to play a prominent part in highly developed
systems (Jewish, Christian, Mithraic). The purification was generally symbolic, but in some
forms of Christian belief the water of baptism is held to have regenerating power[577]--a survival
of the ancient conception of the divinity of water.

+310+. It is often hard to say whether a body of water is regarded simply as itself a living
thing, or is conceived of as the dwelling place of an isolated or independent spirit. In savage
systems the details on this point are hardly ever recorded or obtainable; but the beliefs involved
in later folk-lore make it probable that this latter stage of the construction of creeds is
passed through in savage life. The water maidens of Greek mythology and the Germanic nixies
and water kelpies are developed forms of spirits. Sacred springs and wells are still believed
to be inhabited by beings that are not gods, but possess superhuman power.

+311+. While wells and streams of a domestic character (such as are freely used by human beings)
are generally friendly, they have their unfriendly side. The spirits that dwell in them are
sometimes regarded as being hostile to man. They drag the incautious wanderer into their depths,
and then nothing can save him from drowning. Fear of these malignant beings sometimes prevents
attempts to rescue a drowning person; such attempts are held to bring down the vengeance of
the water-demon on the would-be rescuer.[578]

+312+. In the course of time true water-gods appear. In Greece every river had its deity, and
in India such deities are found in the Mahabharata.[579] When in the Iliad the river Xanthos
rises to seize and drown Achilles, it may be a question whether the stream or the god of the
stream is the actor. Nor is it always possible to say whether the extrahuman Power inhabiting
a water mass is a true god or a spirit; the latter form may pass by invisible gradations into
the former.

+313+. Waters originally divine tend to become the abodes of the deity of the place, or sacred
to him, and healing or other power is ascribed to his presence or agency.[580] Sacred water,
being unwilling to retain anything impure, thus becomes a means of detecting witches and other
criminals, who, when thrown in, cannot sink, but are rejected by the divine Power.

+314+. Deities of streams and springs do not play an important part in worship or in mythology;
their physical functions are not definite enough, and their activities are naturally merged
in or subsumed under those of the greater or more definite local gods. If, for example, the
Canaanite Baals are gods or lords of underground irrigation,[581] this is because they, as
divine lords of the particular regions, control all phenomena; they are, in fact, also gods
of rain and thunderstorms, harvests and war. So rain-gods in general are to be regarded as
local deities, among whose functions that of bestowing rain was regarded as specially important.
In the lowest systems the rain-giver may be a sacred stone, dipped in a stream,[582] or a royal
or priestly magician who is held responsible and is punished if the expected result is not
attained.[583] In such cases the procedure is often one of imitative magic.[584]

+315+. If there be, in the next higher stratum of belief, a local or tribal god, it is he who
is looked to for the rain supply; so the early Hebrews looked to Yahweh,[585] and the Canaanites,
doubtless, to the Baals. The economic importance of rain led, even in low tribes, to the conception
of a special deity charged with its bestowal.[586] In more elaborate mythologies various deities
are credited with rain-making power. In India, for example, Dyaus, the Maruts, Parjanya, Brihaspati,
Indra, Agni,[587] all concerned with rain, have, all except Agni, evidently grown from local
figures with general functions; this appears from the great variety of parts they play. The
same thing is true, perhaps, of Zeus and Jupiter in their character of rain-gods--as all-sufficient
divine patrons they would be dispensers of all blessings, including rain; they seem, however,
to have been originally gods of the sky, and thus naturally the special guardians of rain.[588]

+316+. Great masses of water have given rise to myths, mostly cosmogonic. The conception of
a watery mass as the primeval material of the world (in Egypt, Babylonia, India, Greece, Rome)
belongs not to religion but to science; in a relatively advanced period, however, this mass
was represented as a monster, the antagonist of the gods of light and order, and from this
representation has come a whole literature of myths. In Babylonia a great cosmogonic poem grew
up in which the dragon figures of the water chaos (Tiamat, Mummu, Kingu) play a great part,[589]
and echoes of this myth appear in the later Old Testament books.

+317+. In the more elaborate pantheons the local deities of streams and springs tend to disappear,
and gods of ocean appear: in Babylonia, Ea; in Greece, Okeanos and Poseidon; in Rome, Neptune;
and along with these are numerous subordinate figures--attendants on the great gods, and intrusted
with various particular duties.

FIRE

+318+. There was, doubtless, a time when man had not learned to produce fire, and there may
now be tribes unacquainted with its domestic uses. But such ignorance, if it exists, is rare;
savages generally know how to make fire, and to use it for warmth and for the preparation of
food. When men began to reflect on the origin of things, fire seemed to them so wonderful that
they supposed it must have been discovered or invented, and the knowledge of it bestowed on
men by higher beings, gods or demigods; such benefactors are Hastsezini (of the Navahos), Lightning
(of the Pawnees), the Beaver and the Eagle (of the Thompson River Indians of British Columbia),
Maui (of the Maoris), Agni, Prometheus.[590]

+319+. Though, like other mysterious things, it has been regarded generally (perhaps universally)
as sacred, there is no clear proof that it has been worshiped as divine. What may have been
the case in remote ages we cannot tell, but, according to the information we possess, it has
been, and is, merely revered as in itself mysterious or sacred,[591] or as the abode or production
of a spirit or a deity. Possibly in the early stages of culture known to us there is a fusion
of the element with the indwelling or controlling god or spirit.[592] The divine patrons of
fire are found in all parts of the world, varying in form and function according to the degrees
of advancement of the various communities, from the beast-gods of the Redmen to the departmental
deities of the Maoris, Babylonians, Mexicans, and others, and to the more complicated gods
of Hindus, Greeks, and Romans.[593]

+320+. The most elaborate and most interesting of all fire-cults is the Persian. The ritual
of the Avesta appears at times to describe a worship of the element itself: in Fargard xviii
the fire implores the householder to rise, wash his hands, and put pure wood on the flame;
Yaçna lxi is a hymn of homage and petition addressed to the fire, which is called the son of
Ahura Mazda--the householder asks that all the blessings of life may be his as a reward for
his sacrifice. The numerous temples devoted to the fire-cult, mentioned by later writers,[594]
might seem to look in the same direction. But a comparison of other parts of the Avesta makes
it doubtful whether in the passages just cited anything more is meant than that the fire, as
a creation of Ahura Mazda and sacred to him, is for his sake worthy of reverence and through
him a source of blessing. Thus Yaçna xvii is a hymn in honor of Ahura Mazda and all his creatures,
among which are mentioned the law of Zarathustra, the fire (and five different fires are named),
the soul of the ox, and pure deeds, along with the Amesha-Spentas, the heavenly bodies, and
good men. This collection shows vagueness in the conception of the divine and the sacred, and,
to say the least, leaves it uncertain whether the singer does not think of the fire simply
as a symbol of the Supreme God.

+321+. The relation of fire to the gods, and especially its use in sacrifice, have led to a
number of religious ceremonies in which it plays a principal part.[595] Certain fires must
be kindled by specially appointed sacred persons: among the Todas of Southern India, when a
new dairy is visited or an old dairy is reconsecrated;[596] among the Lacandones of Central
America, on the occasion of the renewal of the incense-bowls;[597] in the Peruvian temple at
the feast of Raymi, when the flame was intrusted to the care of the Virgins of the Sun, and
was to be kept up during the year;[598] in the temples of Hestia and Vesta; throughout Greece,
when the fires had been polluted by the presence of the Persians, it was ordered that they
should be put out and rekindled from the sacred fire at Delphi.[599]

+322+. The purificatory power of fire was, doubtless, a fact of early observation.

+323+. As the physical means of sacrifice, fire acquired a certain symbolic significance; in
the Hebrew ritual "fire-offerings" are regarded as specially important. By Carthaginians, Moabites,
and Hebrews children were devoted to the deity by fire.[600]

+324+. By reason of its brightness fire connects itself in religious imagery with the sun,
with lightning, and with light in general, and so appears frequently as a representation of
the glory of the deity.[601]

+325+. Light is sometimes regarded as an independent thing, and as sacred.[602]

WINDS

+326+. Traces of an early cult of the physical wind may be found, perhaps, in certain customs
that survive in modern communities; as, for example, in the offering of food to the wind that
it may be placated and do no harm.[603] The belief of sailors that wind may be called up by
whistling rests on a process of imitative magic that may be connected with an early cult. Wind
is said to be regarded as a divine being in some American tribes.[604] But generally it is
the spirit or god of a wind (and usually of a definite wind) that is invoked. Examples of wind-gods
are found in all parts of the world.[605] A wind may be the vehicle or the messenger of a deity.[606]

+327+. As in the cases of other elements, referred to above, it is often hard to say whether
it is the thing or the deity that is invoked: Achilles's appeal, for instance, seems to be
to the physical winds, but Iris, who goes to summon them, finds them carousing like men, and
they act like gods.[607] It must be borne in mind, however, that in early thought all active
things are conceived of as being anthropomorphic, and there is the difficulty, just mentioned,
of determining where the anthropomorphic object stops and the spirit or god begins.

HEAVENLY BODIES

+328+. The heavenly bodies seem to have been regarded at first merely as objects somehow thrown
up into the sky or in some other way fixed there by gods or men.[608] Later, under the general
anthropomorphizing tendency, they are conceived of as manlike beings, and their characters
and histories are worked out in accordance with local ideas. Their origin is ascribed at first
to such creative beings as appear in the various early communities; for example, among the
Navahos to the First Man, the First Woman, and the coyote.[609]

+329+. In half-civilized peoples elaborate cosmogonies arise, in which the sky is introduced
along with sun, moon, and stars. The most noteworthy of these representations of the origin
of the sky is one that occurs in almost identical forms in Egypt and New Zealand, among the
Masai of Central East Africa, and elsewhere: two beings lie in marriage embrace--one is lifted
up and stretches from horizon to horizon as the sky, the other remains as the earth.[610] The
sun is commonly male but sometimes female,[611] and there is also diversity of views as to
the sex of the moon. The stars are often called the children of the sun and moon.

+330+. Savage fancy sees in the groups of stars resemblances to human persons and objects.[612]
Such resemblances are worked out by civilized peoples, a descriptive science of constellations
arises, and stories are invented to explain the origin of their names. These stellar myths,
brought into connection with others, play a great part in developed mythologies.

+331+. Among higher communities there are diverse conceptions of the sex of the great luminaries.
The word for 'sun' is feminine in Sanskrit, Anglo-Saxon, German, and often in Hebrew; masculine
in Babylonian, Assyrian, Greek, and Latin. 'Moon' is masculine in Anglo-Saxon and German, and
generally in Sanskrit and the Semitic languages; feminine in Greek and Latin. The reasons for
these differences are to be sought in the economic relations of the communities to sun and
moon, and in the play of imagination, but the history of the variations is not clear. One proposed
explanation is that to those who traveled by night on land or on sea the moon was the strong
guide and patron, and by day the sun appeared as a splendidly beautiful woman. Other explanations
have been offered, but no general determining principle can be stated.[613]

+332+. The early anthropomorphic figures of sun and moon appear to be on the verge of becoming
true gods. It is, however, often difficult to decide whether in the widespread veneration of
the sun it is to be regarded as a living thing (it is frequently represented as a man, a great
chief,[614] dwelling in the sky), or a physical object inhabited by a spirit, or a fully developed
god.[615] The transition to the higher conception is gradual, and will be discussed below,[616]
along with the representations of the moon and the stars.

+333+. The view that the sky and the earth are the original progenitors of things appears among
many peoples, low and high (notably among the Chinese); the two are sometimes taken for granted,
but it is probable that there were always stories accounting for their origin. The sky is sometimes
female, usually in the older myths (Maori, Egyptian), sometimes male (Greek, Roman).[617]

+334+. Thunder and lightning are regarded in early systems of thought as independent things,
only locally or accidentally combined. They are awful and terrible to savage feeling,[618]
but they have never received religious worship. A quasi-scientific explanation of thunder found
among certain peoples (North American, Brazilian, Bakuana, Karen, and others) is that it is
produced by the flapping of the wings of a mighty bird.[619] More commonly thunder is the voice
of a deity, and lightning is his arrow,[620] or these are said simply to be sent by a god.[621]

WORSHIP OF HUMAN BEINGS[622]

+335+. We might naturally suppose that human beings, as well as animals, plants, and inanimate
things, would be objects of religious reverence to undeveloped communities; men, it might seem,
would be thought worthier objects of worship than beasts, plants, and stones. In fact, the
cult of human beings has been and is widespread, but in this cult the savage mind makes a sharp
distinction between the living and the dead. Living men are tangible and intelligible, affected
with human frailties, and therefore offer less food for the imagination than beasts; the souls
of dead men are remote, intangible, mysterious, and it is they that have most inspired religious
emotion. The history of these cults is in some points obscure; though many facts have been
collected, the data are not full and exact enough to furnish a complete explanation of the
details of usage, diffusion, origin, and development.

THE CULT OF THE LIVING

+336+. Savages appear to put no limit to the possible powers of men. In the absence of any
exact knowledge of natural law there is no reason why a man should not be thought capable of
inflicting sickness and death, bringing rain, securing food, and doing all that relates to
human life. Magicians, prophets, ascetics, and saints are credited with such powers in early
and later times. Polynesian chiefs are supposed to be imbued with a sacredness that makes contact
with them dangerous, and everything that they touch becomes thereby taboo to the ordinary man;
the same sort of sacredness clung to the Roman flamen dialis, to the emperor of Japan, and
to many other high officials. This reverence, however, is simply fear of the mysterious, and
does not, in itself, reach the height of worship, though it prepares the way for it and may
sometimes be scarcely distinguishable from worship proper. The magician is the mouthpiece of
a god, and in popular belief is often invested with power that is practically divine.

+337+. Many cases, in fact, are reported in which living men are worshiped as gods; but such
reports are often open to doubt and need confirmation. Travelers and other observers are not
always in position to state the facts precisely; particularly they do not always distinguish
between awe and religious worship, and the statements of savages on this point are often vague.
Frazer has collected a considerable number of examples of alleged worship of living men.[623]
One of these, that of the dairyman (palol) of the Todas of Southern India, is not supported
by the latest observer, who says that the palol is highly respected but not worshiped.[624]
An apparently clear case of worship is the Panjab god Nikkal Sen, said to be General Nicholson;[625]
and it is not improbable that in other cases mentioned by Frazer (Marquesas Islands, Raiatea,
Samoa, Fiji) actual deification takes place.

+338+. Among many more-advanced communities divinity has been ascribed to living monarchs:
to the kings of ancient Egypt; to many early Babylonian kings; to the emperor of China; to
some of the Ptolemies and Seleucids; to certain Roman emperors; to the kings of Mexico and
Peru; and in more modern times to the emperor of Japan. Whether such titles involve a real
ascription of divinity, or are only an assertion of kinship with the gods, or express nothing
more than the adulation of courtiers, it may not be easy always to determine; probably all
these conceptions have existed at various times. The conception that men are akin to gods,
that there is no difference of nature between the two classes, is an old one, and the ascription
of divinity to a king might involve, in earlier stages of civilization or even in relatively
advanced stages, no break in the order of things. The custom once established, it might continue
to be observed, long accepted seriously by the mass of the people, but coming gradually to
be regarded by the educated classes as a mere form.

+339+. The development of the custom appears most plainly in Egypt.[626] The identification
of the king with Horus (apparently the ancient patron deity of Egypt) runs through the history
down to the Persian conquest: he is called "Horus" or "Golden Horus," and sometimes (as, for
example, Mentuhotep IV) "heir of Horus," or is said to sit on the throne of Horus, and has
a "Horus name," the affirmation of his divine character; even the monotheistic reformer Amenhotep
IV is called "Golden Horus." At the same time he is styled the "son" of this or that deity--Re,
Min, Amon, Amon-Re, Osiris--according to the particular patron adopted by him; the liberal
interpretation of such filial relation is illustrated by the title "son of the gods of the
Northland" given to one monarch. The king is "the good god"; at death he flies to heaven (so,
for instance, Totmose III, of the eighteenth dynasty).

+340+. The official honorific character of divine titles appears as early as the fifteenth
century, when Queen Hatshepsut is officially declared to be the daughter of Amon. By such an
official procedure Alexander, though not akin to any Egyptian royal house, was declared to
be the son of Amon; Ptolemy Philadelphus became the son of the sun-god, and his wife Arsinoë
was made a goddess by a solemn ceremony. Possibly the recognition of the divine title, in educated
Egyptian circles, as a conventional form began at a relatively early time--the easy way in
which a man was made a god may have been felt in such circles to be incompatible with real
divinity. Nevertheless the cult of the divinized king was practiced seriously. In some cases
the living monarch had his temple and retinue of priests, and divine honors were paid him.[627]

+341+. The case was different in the Semitic treatment of kings styled divine. The custom of
so regarding them is found only in early Babylonia. The evidence that they were held to be
divine consists in the fact that the determinative for divinity (Sumerian dingir, Semitic an)
is prefixed to their names in the inscriptions.[628] It appears that the determinative occurs
at times during a period of about a thousand years (ca. 3000-2000 B.C.--the chronology is uncertain),
and is then dropped. The data do not explain the reasons for this change of custom; a natural
suggestion is that there came a time when the conception of the deity forbade an ascription
of divinity to human beings. However this may be, the nominal divinization of kings seems not
to have had any effect on the cultus. As far as the known evidence goes, the king seems never
to have been approached with divine worship.[629]

+342+. It may be doubted whether the Babylonian usage can properly be called Semitic. As such
a custom is found nowhere else in the Semitic area, and as the early Babylonian Semites borrowed
much from the non-Semitic Sumerians (they borrowed their system of writing and some literary
material), it is conceivable that they adopted this practice from them. There is, to be sure,
no proof, except from the inscriptions, that the practice was Sumerian; but, as it is found
in some Asiatic non-Semitic lands,[630] there is the possibility that it existed among the
Sumerians, of whose history, however, we unfortunately know little. It is to be noted that
the cessation of the practice appears to be synchronous with the establishment of the first
great Semitic dynasty at Babylon.

+343+. No ascription of divinity to men is found among the Hebrews. The Elohim-beings (called
"sons of God" in the English translation of the Bible) are gods. The code forbids men to curse
God (not "judges")[631]--judges are not called "gods." There is nothing going to show that
the old Hebrew kings were looked on as divine. Frazer's hypothesis that the king was identified
with the God Adonis[632] is not supported by the statements of the Old Testament; the title
'my lord' (adoni) given him is simply the ordinary expression of respect and courtesy. He is
"the anointed of Yahweh," as many ancient official persons (kings and priests) were inducted
into office by the pouring of oil on their heads, but, as a mouthpiece and representative of
the deity, he is inferior to the prophet; at best, flattery, such as that of the woman of Tekoa,
might liken him to an angel.[633] The epithet el gibbor (English Bible, "mighty God"), applied
to a Jewish prince, must probably be rendered 'mighty hero.'[634] The title 'gods' has been
supposed to be given to men (judges) a couple of times in the Psalter,[635] but the reference
there seems to be to Greek deities regarded as acting as judges.

+344+. The ascription of divinity to human beings is lacking in Arabia also and among Semitic
Moslems generally. The Ismailic and Babist dogmas of the incarnation of God in certain men
are of Aryan (Indian) origin.

+345+. The Chinese conception of the all-pervading and absolute power of the Universe naturally
invests the emperor with divinity.[636] All human beings are supposed to possess some portion
of the divine essence, but he alone, as head and representative of the nation, possesses it
in full measure. He is theoretically perfect in thought, word, and deed, and is entitled not
only to the reverence and obedience of his subjects, but also to their religious homage. Larger
acquaintance with other peoples has doubtless led educated Chinese to regard him as only one
among several great kings in the world, but for the people at large he is still practically
a god. Other living men also are worshiped as divine.

+346+. The Japanese formal divinization of the emperor appears to have begun with the establishment
of the monarchy (in the sixth or seventh century of our era), but, like the Chinese, goes back
to the crude conception of early times. It has been generally accepted seriously by the people,
but has not received philosophical formulation. It is now practically given up by the educated
classes, and will probably soon vanish completely.[637]

+347+. Among the Greeks and the Romans the belief in the divinity of living men and women was
of a vague character. In Homer the epithet dios when applied to human beings (individuals or
peoples) means little more, if any more, than 'of exalted character' (except in the case of
mythical heroes, like Achilles, who were of actual divine parentage). At a later time such
divinization was sometimes treated jestingly. If Plutarch may be accepted as authority,[638]
Alexander did not take his own godhead seriously, did not believe in it, but allowed it merely
for its effect on others. It was little more than a farce when the Syrian-Greek Antiochus II,
for services rendered to a city, was called "Theos" by the grateful citizens;[639] it was the
baldest flattery when Herod's oration[640] was greeted by a tumultuous assembly as the "voice
of a god." Augustus, though he allowed temples and altars to be consecrated to him in the provinces,
did not permit it in Rome, being, apparently, ashamed of such procedures.[641] The most infamous
of the early emperors, Caligula, received divine honors in his lifetime by his own decree.[642]
Apart from these particular cases, however, the general conception of the possibility of a
man's being divine had a notable effect on the religious development in the Roman Empire.[643]
The custom, for example, of burning incense before the Emperor's statue (which faithful Christians
refused to do), while it strengthened the idea of the presence of the divine in human life,
doubtless debased it.

+348+. Deification of living men is not found in the great national religions of India and
Persia. Mazdaism, like Hebraism, kept the human distinctly apart from the divine: Ahura Mazda
is virtually absolute, and Zoroaster and the succeeding prophets, including the savior Çaoshyanç,
are men chosen and appointed by him.[644] Vedism developed the nature-gods, and in Brahmanism
the goal of the worshiper was union with the divine, but not independent divinity; the muni
by ascetic observances might attain a power equal or superior to that of the gods and feared
by them,[645] but he remained (like the old magician) a powerful man and did not receive divine
worship.[646] In recent times the followers of the Brahma-Samaj leader Sen are said to have
worshiped him as a god[647]--apparently an isolated phenomenon, the origin of which is not
clear. Buddha was purely human to himself and his contemporaries. The ascription of divinity
to the Tibetan Grand Lamas is a product of the transformation of Buddhism under the influence
of a crude non-Aryan population that retained the old conception of the essential identity
of nature of men and gods.

+349+. When chiefs and kings are divinized, offerings are usually made to them as to other
gods; their cult becomes a part of the polytheistic system. But it is rare that they displace
the old local deities or equal them in influence. Their worship passes with the passing of
polytheism.

THE CULT OF THE DEAD

+350+. In the history of religion the veneration of the dead, as is remarked above, is more
widely diffused and more effective than that of the living. We may distinguish between the
cult of known historical persons after death (which is closely related to that of living men),
the deification of mythical ancestors, and the worship of ghosts.

+351+. Historical persons. In simple communities commanding personalities that have impressed
the imagination of the people by proofs of power and by conferring benefits on communities
may not unnaturally receive divine honors after death. Lyall reports a case of this sort in
recent times: the French officer Raymond in Hyderabad is said to have been worshiped as a god.[648]
Other cases are reported as occuring in Samoa and in India.[649] Rivers mentions traditions
among the Todas of Southern India which, he thinks, may vouch for the worship of gods who were
originally men, but implicit reliance cannot be placed on such traditions.[650] Two apparently
definite instances of deification are given by Ellis,[651] both of cruel kings (one dethroned
in 1818), to whom temples with complete rituals are dedicated; but the deification in one of
these cases (and probably in the other) was a deliberate act of political leaders, and not
a product of spontaneous popular feeling. Two other local gods mentioned by Ellis were, according
to the tradition, two men who began the trade that made Whydah the chief port of the west coast
of Africa; but here also the tradition is not perfectly trustworthy.

+352+. Egyptian kings were regularly deified after death, being identified with Osiris; their
cult, though not equal in sanctity to that of the gods proper, was still prominent and important.[652]
It is probably to be regarded as a revision and magnification of the cult of the dead kin,
combined with the desire to honor great representative men. No such custom is known to have
existed among Semitic peoples, by whom a sharp distinction was made between the divine and
the human. In India it was chiefly the ascetic sages that were religiously eminent, and in
the prevailing pantheistic system these (as is remarked above), absorbing the divine essence,
sometimes became as powerful as gods, but passed after death into the cosmic All, and remained
human. The Mazdean faith, like the Israelite, made it impossible to accept a deceased man as a god.

+353+. Examples of the occasional divinization of deceased men in the Hellenic world are given
below.[653] In Rome the custom arose at a comparatively late period, and it was the work not
of spontaneous Roman thought but of political philosophy.[654] The deification of the Roman
emperors after death had its ground in the reconstruction of Roman life undertaken by Augustus.
He recognized a principle of unification in the resuscitation of the old national religion,
in which the people believed, whether he himself did or not. Religion in Rome was largely an
affair of the state; the leaders of the public religion were great state officials. Augustus
was made pontifex maximus, and it was only one step farther to elevate the chief magistrate
to the rank of a god. The good sense of the time generally forbade the bestowment of this honor
during the imperator's lifetime, but an apotheosis was in accord with the veneration paid to
the manes and with the exalted position of the Emperor as absolute lord of the Western world.[655]
Popular feeling appears to have accepted this divinization without question and in sincerity;
educated circles accepted it as an act of political policy. The elevation of Julius Cæsar and
Augustus to the rank of gods established the rule, and deceased emperors received divine honors
up to the triumph of Christianity.[656]

+354+. In China, Confucius was deified as the special exponent of the state religion and the
authoritative teacher of the principles of social and political life. His religious cult is
practiced by the government (officially) and by the masses of the people; how far it is sincerely
accepted by the educated classes is uncertain. In China and in Japan the gods of war are said
to be historical persons deified.

+355+. The divinization of the Calif Ali by some Shiah sects was the product of religious fanaticism
under the guidance of Aryan conceptions of the incarnation of the divine.[657]

+356+. Mythical ancestors. Mythical ancestors are usually eponymous; the tendency in all ancient
peoples was to refer their names and origins to single persons. Such an eponym was the product
of imagination, a genealogical myth (Hellen, Ion, Dorus, Jacob, Israel), and was revered, but
was not always the object of a religious cult; such cults do not appear among the Semites[658]
or in the native Roman rites. Nor does the custom seem to have originated in the earliest periods;
it was rather a creation of quasi-scientific reflection, the demand for definite historical
organization, and it appears first in relatively late literary monuments.[659]

+357+. Still later arose the worship of these ancestral founders. In Greece shrines were erected
by various cities to their supposed founders, and where, as in Athens, the tribes had their
eponyms, these received divine worship, though they never attained equal rank with the gods
proper. From Greece this cult was brought into Italy. It was probably under Greek influence,
and at a relatively late time, that Romulus was created, made the immediate founder of Rome,
and took his place among the objects of worship;[660] on the other hand, Æneas (a Greek importation),
though he was accepted as original founder, never received divine worship, doubtless because
Romulus (nearer in name to the city Roma) already held the position of divine patron. The cult
of eponyms tended naturally to coalesce with that of divine 'heroes'[661]--the two figures
were alike in character, differing mainly in function, and eponyms were styled 'heroes.'[662]

+358+. The inverse process, the reduction of divine beings to simple human proportions, has
gone on in early cults and in early attempts at historical construction to a not inconsiderable
degree. Thus, to take a relatively late example, by Saxo Grammaticus and in the Heimskringla
(both of the thirteenth century) the god Odin is made into a human king and the history of
his exploits is given in detail.[663] It is, however, especially in the treatment of the old
divine heroes, originally true gods, that the process of dedivinization appears. These figures,
because of their local character and for other reasons, entered into peculiarly close relations
with human societies, of which they thus tended to become constituent parts, and the same feeling
that gave the gods human shapes converted the heroes into mere men, who are generally reconstructers
of society. Examples of this sort of anthropomorphizing are found in myths all over the world:
the Babylonian Gilgamesh; the "mighty men" of Genesis vi, 4, originally demigods, the progeny
of human mothers and of the Elohim-beings (the Benë Elohim, 'sons of the gods,' members, that
is, of the divine circle); Heracles and Hercules; the Scandinavian (apparently general Teutonic)
Valkyrs, Nornas, and Swan-maidens.[664]

+359+. The Sicilian Euhemeros (of the latter part of the fourth century B.C.), after extensive
travels to great places of worship, formulated the theory that all the gods were deified men.
Some grounds for his theory he doubtless had, for, according to ancient opinion, gods might
and did die, and their places of burial were sometimes pointed out (the grave of Zeus, for
instance, in Crete). How far this view had been held before the time of Euhemeros is uncertain,
but he gave it vogue, and it is called, after him, Euhemerism.[665] In recent times it has
been revived in part by Herbert Spencer and Allen, who derive all gods from ghosts.[666] Similar
to it is the rationalizing of myths, which has met with favor at various times.

+360+. The dead kin. Apart from the special cases mentioned above, the dead have been the objects
of particular care in all parts of the world. Some of the observances connected with them might
perhaps, in themselves considered, be ascribed to natural affection. It cannot be denied that
savages have some love of kindred, and this feeling, in conjunction with the ideas concerning
the future state, might lead the survivors to do such things as it was believed would secure
the comfort of the deceased--decent burial in accordance with tribal customs, and provision
of food and attendants and other necessaries. But, while the existence and influence of natural
human kindliness need not be denied, observation of savage life favors the conclusion that
the greater part of the early usages connected with the dead have their origin in the desire
to conciliate them, to avert their displeasure and gain their aid, and thus come to constitute
a cult of the dead that runs through all phases of civilization.[667]

+361+. Such usages must be very ancient, for they are found in the lowest tribes, and appear
to be based on the earliest known conceptions of the nature of departed souls.[668] These latter
are held to have all the ordinary affections of the living, but to be endowed with extraordinary
powers: they have their likes and dislikes, their kindliness, jealousy, anger, revengefulness,
all on the lower moral grade of undeveloped life; they are, in many regards, not subject to
the ordinary limitations of the living--they are invisible, move swiftly from place to place
through obstacles impervious to the living, enter their bodies, produce sickness and death,
aid or destroy crops. On the other hand, they need food and other necessities of ordinary life,
and for these things are dependent on the living. Hence the desirableness of securing their
good will by showing them respect and supplying their needs, or else of somehow getting rid
of them.

+362+. There are, then, two sorts of ghosts, or, more precisely, two sorts of ghostly activity--the
friendly and the unfriendly--and corresponding to these are the emotions of love and fear which
they call forth. On account of paucity of data it is difficult to say which of these emotions
is the commoner among savages; probably the feeling is a mixed one, compounded of fear and
friendliness.[669] In general it is evident that with the better organization of family life
a gentler feeling for the dead was called forth; but it is probable that in the least-developed
communities fear of the mysterious departed was the prevailing emotion.

+363+. Though the accessible evidence does not enable us to determine with certainty the motives
of all savage customs connected with the dead, there are some distinctions that may be made
with fair probability. To supply the dead with food and cooking-utensils may very well be,
as is remarked above, the impulse of affection, and even where slaves and wives are slain that
their ghosts may minister to the ghost of the master and husband, this may not go beyond pious
solicitude for the comfort of the deceased. But the mourning-usages common with savages are
too violent to be merely the expression of love; the loud cries and the wounding of the person
are meant more probably to assure the deceased of the high regard in which he is held;[670]
in some cases, as among the Central Australians, men gash themselves so severely as to come
near producing death.[671] These excessive demonstrations are softened as general culture increases,
and finally dwindle to an apparatus of hired mourners. A similar explanation holds of the restriction
of food, the seclusion of the widow or the widower, and the rule against mentioning the name
of the deceased: abstinence and silence are marks of respect.

+364+. Funeral feasts also testify respect:[672] they appear to be extensions of the practice
of providing food for the dead, feasts in which the mourners, from motives of thriftiness,
take part; the ghost consumes only the invisible soul of the food, and it is proper that what
is left should furnish refreshment for the living.[673] The funeral festivities are sometimes
protracted, and become occasions of enjoyment to the circle of kinsfolk, in some cases at a
ruinous expense to the family of the deceased, as is true now sometimes of Irish and other
wakes. The honor of the family is involved, and this fact, together with the natural desire
for pleasure, has contributed to the development of the custom in savage as well as in civilized
life. In general the solemnity of the various ceremonies and other usages testifies to a profound
conviction of the necessity of keeping on good terms with the dead.[674]

+365+. The reports of savage customs show a certain number of cases in which the benevolent
and the malevolent activities of the dead are equally prominent: so, for example, among the
Australian Kurnai,[675] the New Zealanders,[676] the Melanesian peoples,[677] the Vezimbas
of Madagascar,[678] the Zulus,[679] the Eẃe-speaking tribes on the west coast of Africa.[680]
It is probable that the list might be greatly extended by exact observation. When we find two
peoples, dwelling near together and of the same grade of general culture, credited the one
with fear, the other with friendly feeling toward the dead, it seems likely that different
sets of usages have met the eyes of the observers; a certain amount of accident must color
such reports.

+366+. It is natural to suppose that fear of ghosts is commoner among less-developed peoples,
kindly feeling more usual in higher communities; and when civilized peoples are taken into
account this sort of progression is obvious. But the reports of savages show such a mixture
of customs that it is difficult to see any line of progress. Dread of ghosts is certified in
Central Australia and North Queensland, in Tonga (Polynesia), Central Africa, Central Asia,
among the North American Chippewas, Navahos, and Southwest Oregon Indians, and the South American
Araucanians; friendly feeling is found in Tasmania, Western Africa, South Africa, California,
and among the Iroquois and the Zuñi Indians.[681] In such lists there is no clear sign of a
division according to general culture.

+367+. Friendly relations with the dead do not in themselves necessarily involve worship, but
a more or less definite cult of ghosts is found in various parts of the world. They are, or
were, regarded as tutelary spirits in Tasmania, Ashanti, and Dahomi (where shrines are dedicated
to them), and by the Zuñi Indians; prayers are addressed to them in Samoa and the Hawaiian
Islands (where there is a definite family worship), in Yoruba, by the Banyas and the Zulus,
by the Ossetes, the Veddahs of Ceylon, and the North American Dakotas; offerings are made to
them--sometimes to influential persons, chiefs, and others, as in the Gilbert Islands, in parts
of Melanesia, in Borneo, and by the Cakchiquels of Central America--sometimes to all the dead,
as in the Solomon Islands, the New Hebrides, Fiji, Torres Straits, and by the Zulus, the Veddahs
of Ceylon, the Kolarians of Bengal, and the Ossetes.[682]

+368+. These lists include peoples of very different grades of culture; the inference suggested
is that the cult of the dead is of very early origin--its basis is the same among all communities
that practice it, though the particular ceremonies of worship vary.

+369+. Besides forms of actual worship there are several usages that involve religious veneration
of the dead. Graves are regarded as asylums by the Kafirs (graves of chiefs)[683] and in Tonga.[684]
The Bedawin of Arabia held (in pre-Islamic times), and still hold, graves sacred;[685] they
sometimes become shrines, and oaths are sworn by them. The custom of swearing by the dead is
widespread. In their character of powerful spirits they are agents in processes of magic and
divination. Parts of dead bodies are used as charms. The skull especially is revered as an
oracle.[686]

+370+. Among the lower tribes, savage and half-civilized, it is chiefly those who have died
recently that are worshiped. A Zulu explained to Callaway that his people forgot those who
died long ago--they were supposed to be not helpful--and hope of gain has always been the basis
of worship. Among the Kafirs of the Hindu Kush it is the custom to erect an effigy to the memory
of every adult one year after his decease. Women, as well as men, are thus honored, and may
be put on an equality with men by being given a throne to sit on. No worship is offered to
these images, but it is believed that their presence brings prosperity; bad weather is ascribed
to their removal. There are solemn dances in honor of the illustrious dead and sacrifices are
offered to them.[687]

+371+. The worship of the dead in the great civilized communities, though more elaborate and
refined than the savage cult, is in substance identical with it. The Egyptians provided the
departed soul with food and honored the dead man with laudatory notices of his earthly life;
the royal ancestor of a king, it was believed, might act as mediator between him and the gods.[688]
The Babylonians, while they lamented the departure of men to the gloomy existence in the Underworld,
recognized the quasi-divine power of the dead and addressed prayer to them.[689] The Hebrews
offered food to the dead, had funeral feasts, and consulted ghosts who were regarded as divine.[690]
The Hindu "fathers," though kept distinct from the gods, were yet conceived of as possessing
godlike powers and were worshiped as gods.[691] The Persian "forefathers" (fravashis), particularly
the manes of eminent pious men, were held to be bestowers of all the blessings of life; offerings
were made and prayers addressed to them.[692]

+372+. Early notices of a cult of the dead among the Greeks are scanty. There was the usual
kindly provision of food, arms, and other necessaries for them.[693] Odysseus in Hades pours
out a libation (honey, wine, water, to which meal is added) to all the dead, addresses vows
and prayers to them, and promises to offer to them a barren heifer on his return to Ithaca,
and a black sheep separately to Teiresias.[694] From the sixth century onward the references
in the literature show that the worship of the dead (including children) was then general (and
of course it must have begun much earlier). The offerings made to them were both vegetable
and animal; the sacrificed animal was slaughtered in the same way as in the sacrifices to chthonic
deities--the dead were, in fact, regarded as underground deities.[695] The flesh of the animals
offered was not eaten by the worshipers.

+373+. Among the dead thus honored is to be included one class of heroes. A Greek "hero" was
sometimes an eminent man, sometimes such a man divinized, sometimes an old god reduced to human
dimensions, reckoned in some cases to belong to the circle of the gods proper.[696] Such personages
might be worshiped as gods, with the sacrifices appropriate to the gods, or as departed men,
with the sacrifices that custom fixed for the dead. The hero-cult included many men of note
recently deceased, like Brasidas and those that fell at Marathon.[697]

+374+. The cults just mentioned dealt with the departed as friendly souls, the protectors of
the family, the clan, or the state. The state cult of the dead was elaborate and solemn. The
Greek citizen was surrounded by a host of the eminent dead who kept him in touch with the past
and offered him ideals of life.[698] Another attitude toward the dead is indicated by the great
apotropaic spring festival, the Anthesteria of Athens, the object of which was to rid the city
of the ghosts that then wandered about.[699] This double attitude is precisely that of the
savage tribes referred to above. The same difference of feeling appears in the Roman cults:
the manes are the friendly or doubtful souls of dead ancestors; the Parentalia is a festival
in honor of the dead kin; in the Lemuria, on the other hand, the father of the family performs
a ceremony at midnight intended to rid the house of ghosts.[700]

+375+. Among modern peoples it is the Chinese that have organized the worship of the dead in
the completest way; it is for them the most important part of the popular religion.[701] Similar
veneration of ancestors exists in Japan.[702]

+376+. The venerated dead stood apart, as a rule, from the nature-spirits and the gods, but
these different classes sometimes coalesced, as has been remarked above, in popular usage.
The powers and functions of the dead were not essentially different from those of the divinities
proper, particularly in the simpler stages of society. They were able to bestow all the blessings
and to inflict all the misfortunes of life. In process of time the advance of knowledge relegated
them to a subordinate place, but they long retained a considerable importance as friends of
families and states, as disseminators of disease, and as predictors of human fortunes.

+377+. In the exercise of these functions they were often not to be distinguished from the
higher and lower deities. King Saul, on the eve of a great battle, having failed to get an
answer from the national deity by the ordinary legitimate methods, had recourse to necromancy
and obtained from the ghost of Samuel the information that Yahweh had refused to give.[703]
The Greek kēres and the wandering ghosts of West Africa do exactly what is ascribed to the
malefic spirits of Babylonia.[704] Examples of such identity of function between the various
superhuman Powers are found all over the world.

+378+. This fact does not show that these Powers have the same origin. The savage accepts agents
in human life wherever he can find them--in beings inhabiting mountains, rocks, trees, caves,
springs, and in the souls of departed men. Doubtless he thinks of the forms of these various
actors as being all of the same sort, a sublimated manlike body; but he keeps them in different
categories, and in the course of time the tendency is for ghosts and spirits to sink out of
sight and for the gods to absorb all extrahuman activities.

+379+. The ethical power of the cults so far discussed resides in the human association to
which they give rise and the sanctions they supply to conduct. Of these two effects the former
is the more important. The moral character of a ghost or spirit or deity never rises above
that of its circle of worshipers: its approval or disapproval is the echo of current usage,
and has special efficiency only in the accompanying power of reward or punishment; it appeals
to the hopes and fears of men. This police function is doubtless valuable in restraining from
crime and inciting to good conduct, but it has no regenerative power. The enlargement of human
association, on the other hand, increases sympathy and coöperation among men, and paves the
way to the cultivation of the mutual respect and regard which is the basis of social virtue.

+380+. Among the lower cults ancestor-worship may be expected to take the highest place, for
the reason that it tends to strengthen family unity and the solidarity of the clan, tribe,
or nation; all such knitting together of men makes for the increase of honesty and kindliness.
The data are lacking, however, for the determination of this point. It may be said in general
that the attitude toward the dead becomes finer with advance in civilization; but before a
specific moral power in ancestor-worship can be proved, it will be necessary to have exact
details of moral ideas and conduct in all the lower tribes, together with some information
regarding the attitude of individuals toward questions of conduct, and the motives that impel
toward this or that action. The question of ethical growth in society is a complicated one,
and the most that can be said for any element of social constitution is that it tends to strengthen
or weaken the individual's confidence in and regard for his fellows.

+381+. The part played in religious history by the worship of the dead is so important that
some writers have derived all religion from it.[705] This view is now generally rejected for
the reason that it does not accord with known facts; it is only by forced (though often ingenious)
interpretations that a plausible case is made out for it. To reply in detail to the arguments
advanced in its favor would be to go over the whole ground of the origin of religious observances;
the answer is furnished by setting forth the nature of the various cults, as is attempted in
this and following chapters. If, for example, there is reason to believe that savages have
always regarded the lower animals as powerful beings, there is no need, in accounting for the
veneration given them, to resort to the roundabout way of assuming a misinterpretation of names
of men derived from beasts.

+382+. Between Euhemerism and the theory that explains myths as a "disease of language" there
is little or no essential difference of principle. Both theories assume that man, having devised
certain epithets, later came to misunderstand them and to build up histories on the misunderstanding.
Both thus rest the immense mass of human religious customs and beliefs, which form so large
a part of human history, on the precarious foundation of passing fancy and inadvertence, and
they must be put into the same category with the naïve theory, once popular, that religion
is the invention of priests who sought to control men through their fears.

+383+. Ancestor-worship is the feeling of kinship with the dead, invested by religion with
peculiar intensity and solemnity. It has been one of the great constructive forces of society.

CULTS OF GENERATIVE POWERS

+384+. The origin of religion is not to be referred exclusively to any one order of ideas;
it springs out of man's total life. All objects and processes have been included in men's construction
of nature, and the processes, when they have been held to bear on human well-being, have been
ascribed to a force inherent in things or to the activity of supernatural beings.

+385+. The study of processes has gone hand in hand with the creation of divine beings who
are supposed to manifest themselves in the processes. The great spectacle of nature's productivity
has been especially recognizable in the vegetable world and in the world of man; in both of
these life has been perpetually unfolding itself under men's eyes as a mysterious process,
which, by virtue of its mysteriousness, has become religious material and has entered into
systems of religious worship.

+386+. The relation of vegetable life to religious cults is referred to elsewhere,[706] and
a brief survey may now be given of usages and ideas that have been connected with the production
of human life.

+387+. It is obvious that not all customs that include the function of generation are of the
nature of religious observances. The promiscuity that obtains in many savage communities before
marriage is a naïve unreflective animal procedure. Exchange of wives (as in Central Australia)
and the offering of a wife to a guest are matters of social etiquette. Festivals in which sexual
license is the rule are generally merely the expression of natural impulses. Holidays, being
times of amusement, are occasions used by the people for the satisfaction of all appetites:
there is eating and drinking, buffoonery, disregard of current conventions, unbounded liberty
to do whatever exuberant animalism prompts. Such festivities abound among existing savages,[707]
were not uncommon in ancient civilized times,[708] and have survived in diminished form to
the present day.[709] In the course of time they often become attached to the worship of gods,
are organized, explained by myths, and sanctified. In such cases of coalescence we must distinguish
between the true worship offered to a divine being, and the observances, generally originating
in desire for animal amusement and enjoyment, that have been attached to them.

+388+. Cult of generative organs. Men's attention must have been directed very early to those
organs that were believed to be connected with the genesis of human life. At what stage this
belief arose it is hardly possible to say; there are peoples among whom it seems not to exist;[710]
but it is found over a great part of the world, and was doubtless an outcome of popular observation.[711]
As it was intimately connected with life it passed naturally into the domain of religion, and
in process of time became a more or less prominent part of religious observances; the organs
in question, both male and female, became objects of religious devotion.

+389+. Here again it must be noted that not all usages connected with the organs of generation
were religious of origin. It is pointed out above[712] that the origin of circumcision and
excision is to be sought in another direction. Ithyphallic images are sometimes merely attempts
at realism in art; a nude figure (as in modern art) must be represented in its full proportions.
Such seems to be the nature of certain images among the Western Bantu,[713] and this may have
been the case with the images of the Egyptian Khem and Osiris and similar deities. In general
this sort of representation in savage and ancient civilized communities is often either simple
realism or indecency. Folk-stories abound in details that sound indecent to modern ears, but
were for the authors often merely copies of current usages.

+390+. All important members of the human body have been regarded as to a greater or less extent
sacred, their importance depending on their subservience to man's needs. The head of an enemy
gives the slayer wisdom and strength; an oath sworn by the head or beard of one's father is
peculiarly binding; the heart, when eaten, imparts power; a solemn oath may be sworn by the
sexual organs. In no case does the sacredness of an object necessarily involve its worship;
whether or not it shall receive a true cult depends on general social considerations.

+391+. Though phallic cults proper cannot be shown to be universal among men, they have played
a not inconsiderable part in religious history. They appear to have passed through the usual
grades of development--simple at first, later more complicated. The attitude of savages and
low communities generally, non-Christian and Christian, toward the phallus, suggests that in
the earliest stage of the cult some sort of worship was paid the physical object itself considered
as a creator of life; satisfactory data on this point, however, are lacking. It was at so early
a period that it was brought into cultic connection with supernatural beings that its initial
forms escape us.

+392+. It seems not to exist now among the lowest peoples. There are no definite traces of
it in the tribes of Oceania, Central Africa, Central Asia, and America. The silence of explorers
on this point cannot indeed be taken as proof positive of its nonexistence; yet the absence
of distinct mention of it in a great number of carefully prepared works leads us to infer that
it does not play an important part in the religious systems therein described.[714] It seems
to require, for its establishment, a fairly well-developed social and political organization.
Some of the tribes named above have departmental deities, mostly of a simple sort, but apparently
it has not occurred to them to isolate this particular function, which they probably regarded
as a familiar part of the order of things and not needing special mention. The gift of children
was in the hands of the local god, a generally recognized part of his duty as patron of the
tribe, and all sexual matters naturally might be referred to him. Also, as is remarked above,
in certain tribes there was no knowledge of the connection between the birth of children and
the union of the sexes,[715] and such tribes would of course ascribe no creative power to the
phallus.

+393+. The best example of a half-civilized phallic cult is that which is now practiced in
Yoruba and Dahomi, countries with definite government and institutions. The cult is attached
to the worship of a deity (Elegba or Legba), who appears to be a patron of fertility; the phallus
occupies a prominent place on his temples, and its worship is accompanied by the usual licentious
rites.[716] These are expressions of popular appetite, and it does not appear that the cult
itself is otherwise religiously significant.

+394+. In modern India the Çivaite phallicism is pronounced and important. The linga is treated
as a divine power, and, as producer of fertility, is especially the object of devotion of women;[717]
though Çivaism has its rites of unbridled bestialism, the worship of the linga by women is
often free from impurity; it is practically worship of a deity of fertility. The origin of
the Indian cult is not clear. As it does not appear in the earliest literature, it has been
supposed to have come into Aryan worship from non-Aryan tribes. Whatever its origin, it is
now widely observed in Aryan India, and has been adopted by various outlying tribes.[718]

+395+. While it is, or was, well established in Japan, it apparently has had no marked influence
on the religious thought of the people. Phallic forms abound[719] in the land, in spite of
repressive measures on the part of the government, but the cult partakes of the general looseness
of the Shinto organization of supernatural Powers. It is said to have been adopted in some
cases by Buddhists. It appears to have been combined with Shinto at a very early (half-civilized)
time, for which, however, no records exist.

+396+. It is among the great ancient civilized peoples that the most definite organization
of phallic cults is found.

+397+. For Egypt there is the testimony of Herodotus,[720] who describes a procession of women
bearing small phallic images and singing hymns in honor of a deity whom he calls Dionysos--probably
Khem or Osiris or Bes; such images are mentioned by Plutarch,[721] supposed by him to represent
Osiris. Both Khem and Osiris were great gods, credited with general creative power, and popular
ceremonies of a phallicistic nature might easily be attached to their cults. Bes, a less important
deity, seems to have been fashioned largely by popular fancy. These ceremonies were doubtless
attended with license,[722] but they probably formed no part of Egyptian serious worship. The
phallus was essential in a realistic image, but it appears to have been regarded simply as
a physical part of the god or as an emblem of him; there is no evidence that worship was addressed
to it in itself.

+398+. The evidence that has been adduced for a cult of the phallus among Semitic peoples is
of a doubtful nature. No ithyphallic images or figures of gods have been found. Religious prostitution
there was in all North Semitic lands,[723] but this is a wholly different thing from a phallicistic
cult. It is supposed, however, by not a few scholars that descriptions and representations
of the phallus occur in so many places as to make some sort of cult of the object probable.
In a passage of the Book of Isaiah, descriptive of a foreign cult practiced, probably, by some
Jews, the phallus, it is held, is named.[724] The passage is obscure. The nature and origin
of the cult referred to are not clear; it is not elsewhere mentioned. The word (yad, usually
'hand') supposed to mean 'phallus' is not found in this sense elsewhere in the Old Testament
or in later Hebrew literature. But, if the proposed rendering be adopted, the reference will
be not to a cult of the phallus but to sexual intercourse, a figurative description of idolatry.

+399+. A distinct mention of phalli as connected with religious worship occurs in Pseudo-Lucian's
description of the temple of a certain goddess at Hierapolis.[725] He gives the name to enormously
high structures standing in the propylæa of the temple, but mentions no details suggesting
a phallic cult. Twice a year, he says, a man ascends one of them, on the top of which he stays
seven days, praying, as some think, for a blessing on all Syria--a procedure suggesting that
the pillar was simply a structure consecrated to the deity of the place (probably Atargatis,
who is often called "the Syrian goddess")[726]. However, if there was a phallic cult there
(the phallus being regarded as a symbol of the productive function of the deity), it is not
certain that it was Semitic. Hierapolis had long been an important religious center in a region
in which Asiatic and Greek worships were influential, and foreign elements might easily have
become attached to the worship of a Semitic deity. The cult of the Asian Great Mother (whom
the Greeks identified with their Leto) had orgiastic elements. Lucian's reference to a custom
of emasculation suggests Asian features at Hierapolis.[727]
