But, after all, as he declared to himself, did it not altogether turn on the final answer which
he might get from Florence Mountjoy? Could Florence be brought to accede to his wishes, he
thought that he might still live happily, respectably, and in such a manner that his name might
go down to posterity not altogether blasted. If Florence would consent to live at Tretton,
then could he remain there. He thought it over as he stood there with his back to the fire,
and he told himself that with Florence the first year would be possible, and that after the
first year the struggle would cease to be a struggle. He knew himself, he declared, and he
made all manner of excuses for his former vicious life, basing them all on the hardness of
her treatment of him. He did not know himself, and such assurances were vain. But buoyed up
by such assurances, he resolved that his future fate must be in her hands, and that her word
alone should suffice either to destroy him or to save him.

Thinking thus of his future life, he resolved that he would go at once to Cheltenham, and throw
himself, and what of Tretton belonged to him, at the girl's feet. Nor could he endure himself
to rest another night at Tretton till he had done so. He started at once, and got late to Gloucester,
where he slept, and on the next morning at eleven o'clock was at Cheltenham, out on his way
to Montpellier Terrace. He at once asked for Florence, but circumstances so arranged themselves
that he first found himself closeted with her mother. Mrs. Mountjoy was delighted, and yet
shocked, to see him. "My poor brother!" she said; "and he was buried only yesterday!" Such
explanation as Mountjoy could give was given. He soon made the whole tenor of his thoughts
intelligible to her. "Yes; Tretton was his,--at least he supposed so. As to his future life
he could say nothing. It must depend on Florence. He thought that if she would promise to become
at once his wife, there would be no more gambling. He had felt it to be incumbent on him to
come and tell her so."

Mrs. Mountjoy, frightened by the thorough blackness of his apparel and by the sternness of
his manner, had not a word to say to him in opposition. "Be gentle with her," she said, as
she led the way to the room in which Florence was found. "Your cousin has come to see you,"
she said; "has come immediately after the funeral. I hope you will be gracious to him." Then
she closed the door, and the two were alone together.

"Florence!" he said.

"Mountjoy! We hardly expected you here so soon."

"Where the heart strays the body is apt to follow. I could speak to no one, I could do nothing,
I could hope and pray for nothing till I had seen you."

"You cannot depend on me like that?" she answered.

"I do depend on you most entirely. No human being can depend more thoroughly on another. It
is not my fortune that I have come to offer you, or simply my love, but in very truth my soul."

"Mountjoy, that is wicked!"

"Then wicked let it be. It is true. Tretton, by singular circumstances, is all my own, free
of debt. At any rate, I and others believe it to be so."

"Tretton being all your own can make no difference."

"I told you that I had not come to offer you my fortune." And he almost scowled at her as he
spoke. "You know what my career has hitherto been, though you do not perhaps know what has
driven me to it. Shall I go back, and live after the same fashion, and let Tretton go to the
dogs? My little Mary, or Minnie, tells me almost every dark of little CHIN he
or little Sallie she, and in my mind's eye i take formerly Johnnie

fair is Johnnie he! And sallie she, how sweet!"

Harry, when he was told that Miss Mountjoy was at home, had at once walked in and opened for
himself the door of the front room downstairs. There he found Florence and Mountjoy Scarborough.
Mrs. Mountjoy was still up-stairs in her bedroom, and was palpitating with fear as she thought
of the anger of the two combative lovers. To her belief, Harry was, of the two, the most like
to a roaring lion, because she had heard of him that he had roared so dreadfully on that former
occasion. But she did not instantly go down, detained in her bedroom by the eagerness of her
fear, and by the necessity of resolving how she would behave when she got there.

Harry, when he entered, stood a moment at the door, and then, hurrying across the room, offered
Scarborough his hand. "I have been so sorry," he said, "to hear of your loss; but your father's
health was such that you could not have expected that his life should be prolonged." Mountjoy
muttered something, but his mutterings, as Florence had observed, were made in courtesy. And
the two men had taken each other by the hand; after that they could hardly fly at each other's
throats in her presence. Then Harry crossed to Florence and took her hand. "I never get a line
from you," he said, laughing, "but what you scold me. I think I escape better when I am present;
so here I am."

"You always make wicked propositions, and of course I scold you. A girl has to go on scolding
till she's married, and then it's her turn to get it."

"No wonder, then, that you talk of three years so glibly. I want to be able to scold you."

All this was going on in Mountjoy's presence, while he stood by, silent, black, and scowling.
His position was very difficult,--that of hearing the billing and cooing of these lovers. But
theirs also was not too easy, which made the billing and cooing necessary in his presence.
Each had to seem to be natural, but the billing and cooing were in truth affected. Had he not
been there, would they not have been in each other's arms? and would not she have made him
the proudest man in England by a loving kiss? "I was asking Miss Mountjoy, when you came in,
to be my wife." This Scarborough said with a loud voice, looking Harry full in the face.

"It cannot be," said Florence; "I told you that, for his honor,"--and she laid her hand on
Harry's arm,--"I could listen to no such request."

"The request has to be made again," he said.

"It will be made in vain," said Harry.

"So, no doubt, you think," said Captain Scarborough.

"You can ask herself," said Harry.

"Of course it will be made in vain," said Florence. "Does he think that a girl, in such a matter
as that of loving a man, can be turned here and there at a moment's notice,--that she can say
yes and no alternately to two men? It is impossible. Harry Annesley has chosen me, and I am
infinitely happy in his choice." Here Harry made an attempt to get his arm round her waist,
in which, however, she prevented him, seeing the angry passion rising in her cousin's eyes.
"He is to be my husband, I hope. I have told him that I love him, and I tell you so also. He
has my promise, and I cannot take it back without perjury to him, and ruin, absolute ruin,
to myself. All my happiness in this world depends on him. He is to me my own one absolute master,
to whom I have given myself altogether, as far as this world goes. Even were he to reject me
I could not give myself to another."

"My Florence! my darling!" Harry exclaimed.

"After having told you so much, can you ask your cousin to be untrue to her word and to her
heart, and to become your wife when her heart is utterly within his keeping? Mountjoy, it is
impossible."

"What of me, then?" he said.

"Rouse yourself and love some other girl and marry her, and so do well with yourself and with
your property."

"You talk of your heart," he said, "and you bid me use my own after such fashion as that!"

"A man's heart can be changed, but not a woman's. His love is but one thing among many."

"It is the one thing," said Harry. Then the door opened, and Mrs. Mountjoy entered the room.

"Oh dear! oh dear!" she said, "you, both of you, here together?"

"Yes: we are both here together," said Harry.

There was an unfortunate smile on his face as he said so, which made Mountjoy Scarborough very
angry. The two men were both handsome, two as handsome men as you shall see on a summer's day.
Mountjoy was dark-visaged, with coal-black whiskers and mustaches, with sparkling, angry eyes,
and every feature of his face well cut and finely formed; but there was absent from him all
look of contentment or satisfaction. Harry was light-haired, with long, silken beard, and bright
eyes; but there was usually present to his face a look of infinite joy, which was comfortable
to all beholders. If not strong, as was the other man's, it was happy and eloquent of good
temper. But in one thing they were alike:--neither of them counted aught on his good looks.
Mountjoy had attempted to domineer by his bad temper, and had failed; but Harry, without any
attempt at domineering, always doubting of himself till he had been assured of success by her
lips, had succeeded. Now he was very proud of his success; but he was proud of her, and not
of himself.

"You come in here and boast of what you have done in my presence," said Mountjoy Scarborough.

"How can I not seem to boast when she tells me that she loves me?" said Harry.

"For God's sake, do not quarrel here!" said Mrs. Mountjoy.

"They shall not quarrel at all," said Florence, "There is no cause for quarrelling. When a
girl has given herself away there should be an end of it. No man who knows that she has done
so should speak to her again in the way of love. I will leave you now; but, Harry, you must
come again, in order that I may tell you that you must not have it all your own way, just as
you please, sir." Then she gave him her hand, and passing on at once to Mountjoy, tendered
her hand to him also. "You are my cousin, and the head now of my mother's family. I would fain
know that you would say a kind word to me, and bid me 'God speed.'"

He looked at her, but did not take her hand. "I cannot do it," he said. "I cannot bid you 'God
speed.' You have ruined me, trampled upon me, destroyed me. I am not angry with him," and he
pointed across the room to Harry Annesley; "nor with you; but only with myself." Then, without
speaking a word to his aunt, he marched out of the room and left the house, closing the front-door
after him with a loud noise, which testified to his anger.

"He has gone!" said Mrs. Mountjoy, with a tone of deep tragedy.

"It is better so," said Florence.

"A man must take his chance in such warfare as this," said Harry. "There is something about
Mountjoy Scarborough that, after all, I like. I do not love Augustus, but, with certain faults,
Mountjoy is a good fellow."

"He is the head of our family," said Mrs. Mountjoy, "and is the owner of Tretton."

"That is nothing to do with it," said Florence.

"It has much to do with it," said her mother, "though you would never listen to me. I had set
my heart upon it, but you have determined to thwart me. And yet there was a time when you preferred
him to every one else."

"Never!" said Florence, with energy.

"Yes, you did,--before Mr. Annesley here came in the way."

"It was before I came, at any rate," said Harry.

"I was young, and I did not wish to be disobedient. But I never loved him, and I never told
him so. Now it is out of the question."

"He will never come back again," said Mrs. Mountjoy, mournfully.

"I should be very glad to see him back when I and Florence are man and wife. I don't care how
soon we should see him."

"No; he will never come back," said Florence,--"not as he came to-day. That trouble is at last
over, mamma."

"And my trouble is going to begin."

"Why should there be any trouble? Harry will not give you trouble;--will you, Harry?"

"Never, I trust," said Harry.

"He cannot understand," said Mrs. Mountjoy; "he knows nothing of the desire and ambition of
my life. I had promised him my child, and my word to him is now broken."

"He will have known, mamma, that you could not promise for me. Now go, Harry, because we are
flurried. May I not ask him to come here to-night and to drink tea with us?" This she said,
addressing her mother in a tone of sweetest entreaty. To this Mrs. Mountjoy unwillingly yielded,
and then Harry also took his departure.

Florence was aware that she had gained much by the interview of the morning. Even to her it
began to appear unnecessary that she could keep Harry waiting three years. She had spoken of
postponing the time of her servitude and of preserving for herself the masterdom of her own
condition. But in that respect the truth of her own desires was well understood by them all.
She was anxious enough to submit to her new master, and she felt that the time was coming.
Her mother had yielded so much, and Mountjoy had yielded. Harry was saying to himself at this
very moment that Mountjoy had thrown up the sponge. She, too, was declaring the same thing
for her own comfort in less sporting phraseology, and, what was much more to her, her mother
had nearly thrown up the sponge also. In the worse days of her troubles any suitor had made
himself welcome to her mother who would rescue her child from the fangs of that roaring lion,
Harry Annesley. Mr. Anderson had been received with open arms, and even M. Grascour. Mrs. Mountjoy
had then got it into her head that of all lions which were about in those days Harry roared
the loudest. His sins in regard to leaving poor Mountjoy speechless and motionless on the pavement
had filled her with horror. But Florence now felt that all that had come to an end. Not only
had Mountjoy gone away, but no mention would probably be ever again made of Anderson or Grascour.
When Florence was preparing herself for tea that evening she sung a little song to herself
as to the coming of the conquering hero. "A man must take his chance in such warfare as this,"
she said, repeating to herself her lover's words.

"You can't expect me to be very bright," her mother said to her before Harry came.

There was a sign of yielding in this also; but Florence in her happiness did not wish to make
her mother miserable, "Why not be bright, mamma? Don't you know that Harry is good?"

"No. How am I to know anything about him? He may be utterly penniless."

"But his uncle has offered to let us live in the house and to give us an income. Mr. Prosper
has abandoned all idea of getting married."

"He can be married any day. And why do you want to live in another man's house when you may
live in your own? Tretton is ready for you,--the finest mansion in the whole county." Here
Mrs. Mountjoy exaggerated a little, but some exaggeration may be allowed to a lady in her circumstances.

"Mamma, you know that I cannot live at Tretton."

"It is the house in which I was born."

"How can that signify? When such things happen they are used as additional grounds for satisfaction.
But I cannot marry your nephew because you were born in a certain house. And all that is over
now: you know that Mountjoy will not come back again."

"He would," exclaimed the mother, as though with new hopes.

"Oh, mamma! how can you talk like that? I mean to marry Harry Annesley;--you know that I do.
Why not make your own girl happy by accepting him?" Then Mrs. Mountjoy left the room and went
to her own chamber and cried there, not bitterly, I think, but copiously. Her girl would be
the wife of the squire of Buston, who, after all, was not a bad sort of fellow. At any rate
he would not gamble. There had always been that terrible drawback. And he was a fellow of his
college, in which she would look for, and probably would find, some compensation as to Tretton.
When, therefore, she came down to tea, she was able to receive Harry not with joy but at least
without rebuke.

Conversation was at first somewhat flat between the two. If the old lady could have been induced
to remain up-stairs, Harry felt that the evening would have been much more satisfactory. But,
as it was, he found himself enabled to make some progress. He at once began to address Florence
as his undoubted future spouse, very slyly using words adapted for that purpose: and she, without
any outburst of her intention,--as she had made when discussing the matter with her cousin,--answered
him in the same spirit, and by degrees came so to talk as though the matter were entirely settled.
And then, at last, that future day was absolutely brought on the tapis as though now to be named.

"Three years!" ejaculated Mrs. Mountjoy, as though not even yet surrendering her last hope.

Florence, from the nature of the circumstances, received this in silence. Had it been ten years
she might have expostulated. But a young lady's bashfulness was bound to appear satisfied with
an assurance of marriage within three years. But it was otherwise with Harry. "Good God, Mrs.
Mountjoy, we shall all be dead!" he cried out.

Mrs. Mountjoy showed by her countenance that she was extremely shocked. "Oh, Harry!" said Florence,
"none of us, I hope, will be dead in three years."

"I shall be a great deal too old to be married if I am left alive. Three months, you mean.
It will be just the proper time of year, which does go for something. And three months is always
supposed to be long enough to allow a girl to get her new frocks."

"You know nothing about it, Harry," said Florence. And so the matter was discussed--in such
a manner that when Harry took his departure that evening he was half inclined to sing a song
of himself about the conquering hero. "Dear mamma!" said Florence, kissing her mother with
all the warm, clinging affection of former years. It was very pleasant,--but still Mrs. Mountjoy
went to her room with a sad heart.

When there she sat for a while over the fire, and then drew out her desk. She had been beaten,--absolutely
beaten,--and it was necessary that she should own so much in writing to one person. So she
wrote her letter, which was as follows:

"Dear Mountjoy,--After all it cannot be as I would have had it. As they say, 'Man proposes,
but God disposes.' I would have given her to you now, and would even yet have trusted that
you would have treated her well, had it not been that Mr. Annesley has gained such a hold upon
her affections. She is wilful, as you are, and I cannot bend her. It has been the longing of
my heart that you two should live together at Tretton. But such longings are, I think, wicked,
and are seldom realized.

"I write now just this one line to tell you that it is all settled. I have not been strong
enough to prevent such settling. He talks of three months! But what does it matter? Three months
or three years will be the same to you, and nearly the same to me.

"Your affectionate aunt,

"SARAH MOUNTJOY.

"P.S.--May I as your loving aunt add one word of passionate entreaty? All Tretton is yours
now, and the honor of Tretton is within your keeping. Do not go back to those wretched tables!"

Mountjoy Scarborough when he received this letter cannot be said to have been made unhappy
by it, because he had already known all his unhappiness. But he turned it in his mind as though
to think what would now be the best course of life open to him. And he did think that he had
better go back to those tables against which his aunt had warned him, and there remain till
he had made the acres of Tretton utterly disappear. There was nothing for him which seemed
to be better. And here at home in England even that would at present be impossible to him.
He could not enter the clubs, and elsewhere Samuel Hart would be ever at his heels. And there
was his brother with his lawsuit, though on that matter a compromise had already been offered
to him. Augustus had proposed to him by his lawyer to share Tretton. He would never share Tretton.
His brother should have an income secured to him, but he would keep Tretton in his own hands,--as
long as the gambling-tables would allow him.

He was, in truth, a wretched man, as on that night he did make up his mind, and ringing his
bell called his servant out of his bed to bid him prepare everything for a sudden start. He
would leave Tretton on the following day, or on the day after, and intended at once to go abroad.
"He is off for that place nigh to Italy where they have the gambling-tables," said the butler,
on the following morning, to the valet who declared his master's intentions.

"I shouldn't wonder, Mr. Stokes," said the valet. "I'm told it's a beauteous country and I
should like to see a little of that sort of life myself." Alas, alas! Within a week from that
time Captain Scarborough might have been seen seated in the Monte Carlo room, without any friendly
Samuel Hart to stand over him and guard him.

CHAPTER LXII.

THE LAST OF MR. GREY.

"I have put in my last appearance at the old chamber in Lincoln's Inn Fields," said Mr. Grey,
on arriving home one day early in June.

"Papa, you don't mean it!" said Dolly.

"I do. Why not one day as well as another? I have made up my mind that it is to be so. I have
been thinking of it for the last six weeks. It is done now."

"But you have not told me."

"Well, yes; I have told you all that was necessary. It has come now a little sudden, that is all."

"You will never go back again?"

"Well, I may look in. Mr. Barry will be lord and master."

"At any rate he won't be my lord and master!" said Dolly, showing by the tone of her voice
that the matter had been again discussed by them since the last conversation which was recorded,
and had been settled to her father's satisfaction.

"No;--you at least will be left to me. But the fact is, I cannot have any farther dealings
with the affairs of Mr. Scarborough. The old man who is dead was too many for me. Though I
call him old, he was ever so much younger than I am. Barry says he was the best lawyer he ever
knew. As things go now a man has to be accounted a fool if he attempts to run straight. Barry
does not tell me that I have been a fool, but he clearly thinks so."

"Do you care what Mr. Barry thinks or says?"

"Yes, I do,--in regard to the professional position which I hold. He is confident that Mountjoy
Scarborough is his father's eldest legitimate son, and he believes that the old squire simply
was anxious to supersede him to get some cheap arrangement made as to his debts."

"I supposed that was the case before."

"But what am I to think of such a man? Mr. Barry speaks of him almost with affection. How am
I to get on with such a man as Mr. Barry?"

"He himself is honest."

"Well;--yes, I believe so. But he does not hate the absolute utter roguery of our own client.
And that is not quite all. When the story of the Rummelsburg marriage was told I did not believe
one word of it, and I said so most strongly. I did not at first believe the story that there
had been no such marriage, and I swore to Mr. Scarborough that I would protect Mountjoy and
Mountjoy's creditors against any such scheme as that which was intended. Then I was convinced.
All the details of the Nice marriage were laid before me. It was manifest that the lady had
submitted to be married in a public manner and with all regular forms, while she had a baby,
as it were, in her arms. And I got all the dates. Taking that marriage for granted, Mountjoy
was clearly illegitimate, and I was driven so to confess. Then I took up arms on behalf of
Augustus. Augustus was a thoroughly bad fellow,--a bully and a tyrant; but he was the eldest
son. Then came the question of paying the debts. I thought it a very good thing that the debts
should be payed in the proposed fashion. The men were all to get the money they had actually
lent, and no better arrangement seemed to be probable. I helped in that, feeling that it was
all right. But it was a swindle that I was made to assist in. Of course it was a swindle, if
the Rummelsburg marriage be true, and all these creditors think that I have been a party to
it. Then I swore that I wouldn't believe the Rummelsburg marriage. But Barry and the rest of
them only shake their heads and laugh, and I am told that Mr. Scarborough was the best lawyer
among us!"

"What does it matter? How can that hurt you?" asked Dolly.

"It does hurt me;--that is the truth. I have been at my business long enough. Another system
has grown up which does not suit me. I feel that they all can put their fingers in my eyes.
It may be that I am a fool, and that my idea of honesty is a mistake."

"No!" shouted Dolly.

"I heard of a rich American the other day who had been poor, and was asked how he had suddenly
become so well off. 'I found a partner,' said the American, 'and we went into business together.
He had the capital and I had the experience. We just made a change. He has the experience now
and I have the capital.' When I knew that story I went to strip his coat off the wretch's back;
but Mr. Barry would give him a fine fur cloak as a mark of respect. When I find that clever
rascals are respectable, I think it is time that I should give up work altogether."

Thus it was that Mr. Grey left the house of Grey & Barry, driven to premature retirement by
the vices, or rather frauds, of old Mr. Scarborough. When Augustus went to work, which he did
immediately on his father's death, to wrest the property from the hands of his brother,--or
what part of the property might be possible,--Mr. Grey absolutely declined to have anything
to do with the case. Mr. Barry explained how impossible it was that the house, even for its
own sake, should absolutely secede from all consideration of the question. Mountjoy had been
left in possession, and, according to all the evidence now before them, was the true owner.
Of course he would want a lawyer, and, as Mr. Barry said, would be very well able to pay for
what he wanted. It was necessary that the firm should protect themselves against the vindictiveness
of Mr. Tyrrwhit and Samuel Hart. Should the firm fail to do so, it would leave itself open
to all manner of evil calumnies. The firm had been so long employed on behalf of the Scarboroughs
that now, when the old squire was dead, it could not afford to relinquish the business till
this final great question had been settled. It was necessary, as Mr. Barry said, that they
should see it out, Mr. Barry taking a much more leading part in these discussions than had
been his wont. Consequently Mr. Grey had told him that he might do it himself, and Mr. Barry
had been quite contented. Mr. Barry, in talking the matter over with one of the clerks, whom
he afterward took into partnership, expressed his opinion that "poor old Grey was altogether
off the hooks." "Old Grey" had always been Mr. Grey when spoken of by Mr. Barry till that day,
and the clerk remarking this, left Mr. Grey's bell unanswered for three or four minutes. Mr.
Grey, though he was quite willing to shelf himself, understood it all, and knocked them about
in the chambers that afternoon with unwonted severity. He said nothing about it when he came
home that evening: but the next day was the last on which he took his accustomed chair.

"What will you do with yourself, papa?" Dolly said to him the next morning.

"Do with myself?"

"What employment will you take in hand? One has to think of that, and to live accordingly.
If you would like to turn farmer, we must live in the country."

"Certainly I shall not do that. I need not absolutely throw away what money I have saved."

"Or if you were fond of shooting or hunting?"

"You know very well I never shot a bird, and hardly ever crossed a horse in my life."

"But you are fond of gardening."

"Haven't I got garden enough here?"

"Quite enough, if you think so; but will there be occupation sufficient in that to find you
employment for all your life?"

"I shall read."

"It seems to me," she said, "that reading becomes wearisome as an only pursuit, unless you've
made yourself accustomed to it."

"Sha'n't I have as much employment as you?"

"A woman is so different! Darning will get through an unlimited number of hours. A new set
of underclothing will occupy me for a fortnight. Turning the big girl's dresses over there
into frocks for the little girls is sufficient to keep my mind in employment for a month. Then
I have the maid-servants to look after, and to guard against their lovers. I have the dinners
to provide, and to see that the cook does not give the fragments to the policeman. I have been
brought up to do these things, and habit has made them usual occupations to me. I never envied
you when you had to encounter all Mr. Scarborough's vagaries; but I knew that they sufficed
to give you something to do."

"They have sufficed," said he, "to leave me without anything that I can do."

"You must not allow yourself to be so left. You must find out some employment." Then they sat
silent for a time, while Mr. Grey occupied himself with some of the numerous papers which it
would be necessary that he should hand over to Mr. Barry. "And now," said Dolly, "Mr. Carroll
will have gone out, and I will go over to the Terrace. I have to see them every day, and Mr.
Carroll has the decency to take himself off to some billiard-table so as to make room for me."

"What are they doing about that man?" said Mr. Grey.

"About the lover? Mr. Juniper has, I fancy, made himself extremely disagreeable, not satisfying
himself with abusing you and me, but poor aunt as well, and all the girls. He has, I fancy,
got some money of his own."

"He has had money paid to him by Captain Scarborough; but that I should fancy would rather
make him in a good humor than the reverse."

"He is only in a good humor, I take it, when he has something to get. However, I must be off
now, or the legitimate period of Uncle Carroll's absence will be over."

Mr. Grey, when he was left alone, at once gave up the manipulation of his papers, and, throwing
himself back into his chair, began to think of that future life of which he had talked so easily
to his daughter. What should he do with himself? He believed that he could manage with his
books for two hours a day; but even of that he was not sure. He much doubted whether for many
years past the time devoted to reading in his own house had amounted to one hour a day. He
thought that he could employ himself in the garden for two hours; but that would fail him when
there should be hail, or fierce sunshine, or frost, or snow, or rain. Eating and drinking would
be much to him; but he could not but look forward to self-reproach if eating and drinking were
to be the joy of his life. Then he thought of Dolly's life,--how much purer and better and
nobler it had been than his own. She talked in a slighting, careless tone of her usual day's
work, but how much of her time had been occupied in doing the tasks of others? He knew well
that she disliked the Carrolls. She would speak of her own dislike of them as of her great
sin, of which it was necessary that she should repent in sackcloth and ashes.

But yet how she worked for the family! turning old dresses into new frocks, as though the girls
who had worn them, and the children who were to wear them, had been to her her dearest friends.
Every day she went across to the house intent upon doing good offices; and this was the repentance
in sackcloth and ashes which she exacted from herself. Could not he do as she did? He could
not darn Minnie's and Brenda's stockings, but he might do something to make those children
more worthy of their cousin's care. He could not associate with his brother-in-law, because
he was sure that Mr. Carroll would not endure his society; but he might labor to do something
for the reform even of this abominable man. Before Dolly had come back to him he had resolved
that he could only redeem his life from the stagnation with which it was threatened by working
for others, now that the work of his own life had come to a close. "Well, Dolly," he said,
as soon as she had entered the room, "have you heard any thing more about Mr. Juniper?"

"Have you been here ever since, papa?"

"Yes, indeed; I used to sit at chambers for six or seven hours at a stretch, almost without
getting out of my chair."

"And are you still employed about those awful papers?"

"I have not looked at them since you left the room."

"Then you must have been asleep."

"No, indeed; I have not been asleep. You left me too much to think of to enable me to sleep.
What am I to do with myself besides eating and drinking, so that I shall not sleep always on
this side of the grave?"

"There are twenty things, papa,--thirty, fifty, for a man so minded as you are." This she said
trying to comfort him.

"I must endeavor to find one or two of the fifty." Then he went back to his papers, and really
worked hard on that day.

On the following morning, early, he went across to Bolsover Terrace, to begin his task of reproving
the Carroll family, without saying a word to Dolly indicative of his purpose.

He found that the task would be difficult, and as he went he considered within his mind how
best it might be accomplished. He had put a prayer-book in his pocket, without giving it much
thought; but before he knocked at the door he had assured himself that the prayer-book would
not be of avail. He would not know how to begin to use it, and felt that it would be ridiculed.
He must leave that to Dolly or to the clergyman. He could talk to the girls; but they would
not care about the affairs of the firm; and, in truth, he did not know what they would care
about. With Dolly he could hold sweet converse as long as she would remain with him. But he
had been present at the bringing up of Dolly, and did think that gifts had been given to Dolly
which had not fallen to the lot of the Carroll girls. "They all want to be married," he said
to himself, "and that at any rate is a legitimate desire."

With this he knocked at the door, and when it was opened by Sophia, he found an old gentleman
with black cotton gloves and a doubtful white cravat just preparing for his departure. There
was Amelia, then giving him his hat, and looking as pure and proper as though she had never
been winked at by Prince Chitakov. Then the mother came through from the parlor into the passage.
"Oh, John! how very kind of you to come. Mr. Matterson, pray let me introduce you to my brother,
Mr. Grey. John, this is the Rev. Mr. Matterson, a clergyman who is a very intimate friend of
Amelia."

"Me, ma! Why me in particular?"

"Well, my dear, because it is so. I suppose it is so because Mr. Patterson likes you the best."

"Laws, ma; what nonsense!" Mr. Matterson appeared to be a very shy gentleman, and only anxious
to escape from the hall-door. But Mr. Grey remembered that in former days, before the coming
of Mr. Juniper upon the scene, he had heard of a clerical admirer. He had been told that the
gentleman's name was Matterson, that he was not very young nor very rich, that he had five
or six children, and that he could afford to marry if the wife could bring with her about one
hundred pounds a year. He had not then thought much of Mr. Matterson, and no direct appeal
had been made to him. After that Mr. Juniper had come forward, and then Mr. Juniper had been
altogether abolished. But it occurred to Mr. Grey that Mr. Matterson was at any rate better
than Mr. Juniper; that he was by profession a gentleman, and that there might be a beginning
of those good deeds by which he was anxious to make the evening of his days bearable to himself.

"I am delighted to make Mr. Matterson's acquaintance," he said, as that old gentleman scrambled
out of the door.

Then his sister took him by the arm and led him at once into the parlor. "You might as well
come and hear what I have to say, Amelia." So the daughter followed them in. "He is the most
praiseworthy gentleman you ever knew, John," began Mrs. Carroll.

"A clergyman, I think?"

"Oh yes; he is in orders,--in priest's orders," said Mrs. Carroll, meaning to make the most
of Mr. Matterson. "He has a church over at Putney."

"I am glad of that," said Mr. Grey.

"Yes, indeed; though it isn't very good, because it's only a curate's one hundred and fifty
pounds. Yes; he does have one hundred and fifty pounds, and something out of the surplice fees."

"Another one hundred pounds I believe it is," said Amelia.

"Not quite so much as that, my dear, but it is something."

"He is a widower with children, I believe?" said Mr. Grey.

"There are children--five of them; the prettiest little dears one ever saw. The eldest is just
about thirteen." This was a fib, because Mrs. Carroll knew that the eldest boy was sixteen;
but what did it signify? "Amelia is so warmly attached to them."

"It is a settled thing, then?"

"We hope so. It cannot be said to be quite settled, because there are always money difficulties.
Poor Mr. Matterson must have some increase to his income before he can afford it."

"Ah, yes!"

"You did say something, uncle, about five hundred pounds," said Amelia.

"Four hundred and fifty, my dear," said Mr. Grey.

"Oh, I had forgotten. I did say that I hoped there would be five hundred."

"There shall be five hundred," said Mr. Grey, remembering that now had come the time for doing
to one of the Carroll family the good things of which he had thought to himself. "As Mr. Matterson
is a clergyman of whom I have heard nothing but good, it shall be five hundred." He had in
truth heard nothing either good or bad respecting Mr. Matterson.

Then he asked Amelia to take a walk with him as he went home, reflecting that now had come
the time in which a little wholesome conversation might have its effect. And an idea entered
his head that in his old age an acquaintance with a neighboring clergyman might be salutary
to himself. So Amelia got her bonnet and walked home with him.

"Is he an eloquent preacher, my dear?" But Amelia had never heard him preach. "I suppose there
will be plenty for you to do in your new home."

"I don't mean to be put upon, if you mean that, uncle."

"But five children!"

"There is a servant who looks after them. Of course I shall have to see to Mr. Matterson's
own things, but I have told him I cannot slave for them all. The three eldest have to be sent
somewhere; that has been agreed upon. He has got an unmarried sister who can quite afford to
do as much as that." Then she explained her reasons for the marriage. "Papa is getting quite
unbearable, and Sophy spoils him in everything."

Poor Mr. Grey, when his niece turned and went back home, thought that, as far as the girl was
concerned, or her future household, there would be very little room for employment for him.
Mr. Matterson wanted an upper servant who instead of demanding wages, would bring a little
money with her, and he could not but feel that the poor clergyman would find that he had taken
into his house a bad and expensive upper servant.

"Never mind, papa," said Dolly, "we will go on and persevere, and if we intend to do good,
good will come of it."

CHAPTER LXIII.

THE LAST OF AUGUSTUS SCARBOROUGH.

When old Mr. Scarborough was dead, and had been for a while buried, Augustus made his application
in form to Messrs. Grey & Barry. He made it through his own attorney, and had now received
Mr. Barry's answer through the same attorney. The nature of the application had been in this
wise: that Mr. Augustus Scarborough had been put in to the position of the eldest son; that
he did not himself in the least doubt that such was his true position; that close inquiry had
been made at the time, and that the lawyers, including Mr. Grey and Mr. Barry had assented
to the statements as then made by old Mr. Scarborough; that he himself had then gone to work
to pay his brother's debts, for the honor of the family, and had paid them partly out of his
own immediate pocket, and partly out of the estate, which was the same as his own property;
that during his brother's "abeyance" he had assisted in his maintenance, and, on his brother's
return, had taken him to his own home; that then his father had died, and that this incredible
new story had been told. Mr. Augustus Scarborough was in no way desirous of animadverting on
his father's memory, but was forced to repeat his belief that he was his father's eldest son,
and was, in fact, at that moment the legitimate owner of Tretton, in accordance with the existing
contract. He did not wish to dispute his father's will, though his father's mental and bodily
condition at the time of the making of the will might, perhaps, enable him to do so with success.
The will might be allowed to pass valid, but the rights of primogeniture must be held sacred.

Nevertheless, having his mother's memory in great honor, he felt himself ill inclined to drag
the family history before the public. For his mother's sake he was open to a compromise. He
would advise that the whole property,--that which would pass under the entail, and that which
was intended to be left by will,--should be valued, and that the total should then be divided
between them. If his brother chose to take the family mansion, it should be so. Augustus Scarborough
had no desire to set himself over his brother. But if this offer were not accepted, he must
at once go to law, and prove that their Nice marriage had been, in fact, the one marriage by
which his father and mother had been joined together. There was another proviso added to this
offer: as the valuation and division of the property must take time, an income at the rate
of two hundred pounds a month should be allowed to Augustus till such time as it should be
completed. Such was the offer which Augustus had authorized his attorney to make.

There was some delay in getting Mountjoy to consent to a reply. Before the offer had reached
Mr. Barry he was already at Monte Carlo, with that ready money his father had left behind him.
At every venture that he made,--at least at every loss which he incurred,--he told himself
that it was altogether the doings of Florence Mountjoy. But he returned to England, and consented
to a reply. He was the eldest son, and meant to support that position, both on his mother's
behalf and on his own. As to his father's will, made in his favor, he felt sure that his brother
would not have the hardihood to dispute it. A man's bodily sufferings were no impediment to
his making a will; of mental incapacity he had never heard his father accused till the accusation
had now been made by his own son. He was, however, well aware that it would not be preferred.
As to what his brother had done for himself, it was hardly worth his while to answer such an
allegation. His memory carried him but little farther back than the day on which his brother
turned him out of his rooms.

There were, however, many reasons,--and this was put in at the suggestion of Mr. Barry,--why
he would not wish that his brother should be left penniless. If his brother would be willing
to withdraw altogether from any lawsuit, and would lend his co-operation to a speedy arrangement
of the family matters, a thousand a year,--or twenty-five thousand pounds,--should be made
over to him as a younger brother's portion. To this offer it would be necessary that a speedy
reply should be given, and, under such circumstances, no temporary income need be supplied.

It was early in June when Augustus was sitting in his luxurious lodgings in Victoria Street,
contemplating this reply. His own lawyer had advised him to accept the offer, but he had declared
to himself a dozen times since his father's death that, in this matter of the property, he
would "either make a spoon or spoil a horn." And the lawyer was no friend of his own,--was
not a man who knew nothing of the facts of the case beyond what were told him, and nothing
of the working of his client's mind. Augustus had looked to him only for the law in the matter,
and the lawyer had declared the law to be against his client. "All that your father said about
the Nice marriage will go for nothing. It will be shown that he had an object."

"But there certainly was such a marriage."

"No doubt there was some ceremony--performed with an object. A second marriage cannot invalidate
the first, though it may itself be altogether invalidated. The Rummelsburg marriage is, and
will be, an established fact, and of the Rummelsburg marriage your brother was no doubt the
issue. Accept the offer of an income. Of course we can come to terms as to the amount; and
from your brother's character it is probable enough that he may increase it." Such had been
his lawyer's advice, and Augustus was sitting there in his lodging thinking of it.

He was not a happy man as he sat there. In the first first place he owed a little money, and
the debt had come upon him chiefly from his lavish expenditure in maintaining Mountjoy and
Mountjoy's servant upon their travels. At that time he had thought that by lavish expenditure
he might make Tretton certainly his own. He had not known his brother's character, and had
thought that by such means he could keep him down, with his head well under water. His brother
might drink,--take to drinking regularly at Monte Carlo or some other place,--and might so
die. Or he would surely gamble himself into farther and utter ruin. At any rate he would be
well out of the way, and Augustus in his pride had been glad to feel that he had his brother
well under his thumb. Then the debt had been paid with the object of saving the estate from
litigation on the part of the creditors. That had been his one great mistake. And he had not
known his father, or his father's guile, or his father's strength. Why had not his father died
at once?--as all the world had assured him would be the case. Looking back he could remember
that the idea of paying the creditors had at first come from his father, simply as a vague
idea! Oh, what a crafty rascal his father had been! And then he had allowed himself, in his
pride, to insult his father, and had spoken of his father's coming death as a thing that was
desirable! From that moment his father had plotted his ruin. He could see it all now.

He was still minded to make the spoon; but he found that he should spoil the horn. Had there
been any one to assist him he would still have persevered. He thought that he could have persevered
with a lawyer who would really have taken up his case with interest. If Mountjoy could be made
to drink--so as to die! He was still next in the entail; and he was his brother's heir should
his brother die without a will. But so he would be if he took the twenty-five thousand pounds.
But to accept so poor a modicum would go frightfully against the grain with him. He seemed
to think that by taking the allowance he would bring back his brother to all the long-lived
decencies of life. He would have to surrender altogether that feeling of conscious superiority
which had been so much to him. "D----n the fellow!" he exclaimed to himself. "I should not
wonder if he were in that fellow's pay." The first "fellow" here was the lawyer, and the second
was his brother.

When he had sat there alone for half an hour he could not make up his mind. When all his debts
were paid he would not have much above twenty-five thousand pounds. His father had absolutely
extracted five thousand pounds from him toward paying his brother's debts! The money had been
wanted immediately. Together with the sum coming from the new purchasers, father and son must
each subscribe five thousand pounds to pay those Jews. So it had been represented to him, and
he had borrowed the money to carry out his object. Had ever any one been so swindled, so cruelly
treated! This might probably be explained, and the five thousand pounds might be added to the
twenty-five thousand pounds. But the explanation would be necessary, and all his pride would
rebel against it. On that night when by chance he had come across his brother, bleeding and
still half drunk, as he was about to enter his lodging, how completely under his thumb he had
been! And now he was offering him of his bounty this wretched pittance! Then with half-muttered
curses he execrated the names of his father, his brother, of Grey, and of Barry, and of his
own lawyer.

At that moment the door was opened and his bosom friend, Septimus Jones, entered the room.
At any rate this friend was the nearest he had to his bosom. He was a man without friends in
the true sense. There was no one who knew the innermost wishes of his heart, the secret desires
of his soul. There are thus so many who can divulge to none those secret wishes! And how can
such a one have a friend who can advise him as to what he shall do? Scarcely can the honest
man have such a friend, because it is so difficult for him to find a man who will believe in
him. Augustus had no desire for such a friend, but he did desire some one who would do his
bidding as though he were such a friend. He wanted a friend who would listen to his words,
and act as though they were the truth. Mr. Septimus Jones was the man he had chosen, but he
did not in the least believe in Mr. Septimus Jones himself. "What does that man say?" asked
Septimus Jones. The man was the lawyer of whom Augustus was now thinking, at this very moment,
all manner of evil.

"D----n him!" said Augustus.

"With all my heart. But what does he say? As you are to pay him for what he says, it is worth
while listening to it."

There was a tone in the voice of Septimus Jones which declared at once some diminution of his
usual respect. So it sounded, at least, to Augustus. He was no longer the assured heir of Tretton,
and in this way he was to be told of the failure of his golden hopes. It would be odd, he thought,
if he could not still hold his dominion over Septimus Jones. "I am not at all sure that I shall
listen to him or to you either."

"As for that, you can do as you like."

"Of course I can do as I like." Then he remembered that he must still use the man as a messenger,
if in no other capacity. "Of course he wants to compromise it. A lawyer always proposes a compromise.
He cannot be beat that way, and it is safe for him."

"You had agreed to that."

"But what are the terms to be?--that is the question. I made my offer:--half and half. Nothing
fairer can be imagined,--unless, indeed, I choose to stand out for the whole property."

"But what does your brother say?"

He could not use his friend even as a messenger without telling him something of the truth.
"When I think of it, of this injustice, I can hardly hold myself. He proposes to give me twenty-five
thousand pounds."

"Twenty-five thousand pounds!--for everything?"

"Everything; yes. What the devil do you suppose I mean? Now just listen to me." Then he told
his tale as he thought that it ought to be told. He recapitulated all the money he had spent
on his brother's behalf, and all that he chose to say that he had spent. He painted in glowing
colors the position in which he would have been put by the Nice marriage. He was both angry
and pathetic about the creditors. And he tore his hair almost with vexation at the treatment
to which he was subjected.

"I think I'd take the twenty-five thousand pounds," said Jones.

"Never! I'd rather starve first!"

"That's about what you'll have to do if all that you tell me is true." There was again that
tone of disappearing subjection. "I'll be shot if I wouldn't take the money." Then there was
a pause. "Couldn't you do that and go to law with him afterward? That was what your father
would have done." Yes; but Augustus had to acknowledge that he was not as clever as his father.

At last he gave Jones a commission. Jones was to see his brother and to explain to him that,
before any question could be raised as to the amount to be paid under the compromise, a sum
of ten thousand pounds must be handed to Augustus to reimburse him for money out of pocket.
Then Jones was to say, as out of his own head, that he thought that Augustus might probably
accept fifty thousand pounds in lieu of twenty-five thousand pounds. That would still leave
the bulk of the property to Mountjoy, although Mountjoy must be aware of the great difficulties
which would be thrown in his way by his father's conduct. But Jones had to come back the next
day with an intimation that Mountjoy had again gone abroad, leaving full authority with Mr. Barry.

Jones was sent to Mr. Barry, but without effect. Mr. Barry would discuss the matter with the
lawyer, or, if Augustus was so pleased, with himself; but he was sure that no good would be
done by any conversation with Mr. Jones. A month went on--two months went by--and nothing came
of it. "It is no use your coming here, Mr. Scarborough," at last Mr. Barry said to him with
but scant courtesy. "We are perfectly sure of our ground. There is not a penny due you;--not
a penny. If you will sign certain documents, which I would advise you to do in the presence
of your own lawyer, there will be twenty-five thousand pounds for you. You must excuse me if
I say that I cannot see you again on the subject,--unless you accept your brother's liberality."

At this time, Augustus was very short of money and, as is always the case, those to whom he
owed aught became pressing as his readiness to pay them gradually receded. But to be so spoken
to by a lawyer,--he, Scarborough of Tretton, as he had all but been,--to be so addressed by
a man whom he had regarded as old Grey's clerk, was bitter indeed. He had been so exalted by
that Nice marriage, had been so lifted high in the world, that he was now absolutely prostrate.
He quarrelled with his lawyer, and he quarrelled also with Septimus Jones. There was no one
with whom he could discuss the matter, or rather no one who would discuss it with him on his
terms. So at last he accepted the money, and went daily into the City in order that he might
turn it into more. What became of him in the City it is hardly the province of this chronicle
to tell.

CHAPTER LXIV.

THE LAST OF FLORENCE MOUNTJOY.

Now at last in this chapter has to be told the fate of Florence Mountjoy, as far as it can
be told in these pages. It was, at any rate, her peculiarity to attach to herself, by bonds
which could not easily be severed, those who had once thought that they might be able to win
her love. An attempt has been made to show how firm and determined were the affections of Harry
Annesley, and how absolutely he trusted in her word when once it had been given to him. He
had seemed to think that when she had even nodded to him, in answer to his assertion that he
desired her to be his wife, all his trouble as regarded her heart had been off his mind.

There might be infinite trouble as to time,--as to ten years, three years, or even one year;
trouble in inducing her to promise that she would become his wife in opposition to her mother;
but he had felt sure that she never would be the wife of any one else. How he had at last succeeded
in mitigating the opposition of her mother, so as to make the three years, or even the one
year, appear to himself an altogether impossible delay, the reader knows. How he at last contrived
to have his own way altogether, so that, as Florence told him, she was merely a ball in his
hand, the reader will have to know very shortly. But not a shade of doubt had ever clouded
Harry's mind as to his eventual success since she had nodded to him at Mrs. Armitage's ball.
Though this girl's love had been so grand a thing to have achieved, he was quite sure from
that moment that it would be his forever.

With Mountjoy Scarborough there had never come such a moment, and never could; yet he had been
very confident, so that he had lived on the assurance that such a moment would come. And the
self-deportment natural to her had been such that he had shown his assurance. He never would
have succeeded; but he should not the less love her sincerely. And when the time came for him
to think what he should do with himself, those few days after his father's death, he turned
to her as his one prospect of salvation. If his cousin Florence would be good to him all might
yet be well. He had come by that time to lose his assurance. He had recognized Harry Annesley
as his enemy, as has been told often enough in these pages. Harry was to him a hateful stumbling-block.
And he had not been quite as sure of her fidelity to another as Harry had been sure of it to
himself. Tretton might prevail. Trettons do so often prevail. And the girl's mother was all
on his side. So he had gone to Cheltenham, true as the needle to the pole, to try his luck
yet once again. He had gone to Cheltenham, and there he found Harry Annesley. All hopes for
him were then over and he started at once for Monaco; or, as he himself told himself, for the
devil.

Among the lovers of Florence some memory may attach itself to poor Hugh Anderson. He too had
been absolutely true to Florence. From the hour in which he had first conceived the idea that
she would make him happy as his wife, it had gone on growing upon him with all the weight of
love, He did not quite understand why he should have loved her so dearly, but thus it was.
Such a Mrs. Hugh Anderson, with a pair of horses on the boulevards, was to his imagination
the most lovely sight which could be painted. Then Florence took the mode of disabusing him
which has been told, and Hugh Anderson gave the required promise. Alas, in what an unfortunate
moment had he done so! Such was his own thought. For though he was sure of his own attachment
to her, he could not mount high enough to be as sure of her to somebody else. It was a "sort
of thing a man oughtn't to have been asked to promise," he said to the third secretary. And
having so determined, he made up his mind to follow her to England and to try his fortune once
again.

Florence had just wished Harry good-bye for the day, or rather for the week. She cared for
nothing now in the way of protestations of affection. "Come Harry--there now--don't be so unreasonable.
Am not I just as impatient as you are? This day fortnight you will be back, and then--"

"Then there will be some peace, won't there? But mind you write every day." And so Harry was
whisked away, as triumphant a man as ever left Cheltenham by the London train. On the following
morning Hugh Anderson reached Cheltenham and appeared in Montpellier Place.

"My daughter is at home, certainly," said Mrs. Mountjoy. There was something in the tone which
made the young man at once assure himself that he had better go back to Brussels. He had even
been a favorite with Mrs. Mountjoy. In his days of love-making poor Mountjoy had been absent,
declared no longer to have a chance of Tretton, and Harry had been--the very evil one himself.
Mrs. Mountjoy had been assured by the Brussels Mountjoy that, with the view of getting well
rid of the evil one, she had better take poor Anderson to her bosom. She had opened her bosom
accordingly, but with very poor results. And now he had come to look after what result there
might be. Mrs. Mountjoy felt that he had better go back to Brussels.

"Could I not see her?" asked Anderson.

"Well, yes; you could see her."

"Mrs. Mountjoy, I'll tell you everything, just as though you were my own mother. I have loved
your daughter;--oh, I don't know how it is! If she'd be my wife for two years, I don't think
I'd mind dying afterward."

"Oh, Mr. Anderson!"

"I wouldn't. I never heard of a case where a girl had got such a hold of a man as she has of me."

"You don't mean to say that she has behaved badly?"

"Oh no! She couldn't behave badly;--it isn't in her. But she can bowl a fellow over in the
most--well, most desperate manner. As for me, I'm not worth my salt since I first saw her.
When I go to ride with the governor I haven't a word to say to him," But this ended in Mrs.
Mountjoy going and promising that she would send Florence down in her place. She knew that
it would be in vain; but to a young man who had behaved so well as Mr. Anderson so much could
not be refused. "Here I am again," he said, very much like Punch in the pantomime.

"Oh, Mr. Anderson! how do you do?"

A lover who is anxious to prevail with a lady should always hold up his head. Where is the
writer of novels, or of human nature, who does not know as much as that? And yet the man who
is in love, truly in love, never does hold up his head very high. It is the man who is not
in love who does so. Nevertheless it does sometimes happen that the true lover obtains his
reward. In this case it was not observed to be so. But now Mr. Anderson was sure of his fate,
so that there was no encouragement to him to make any attempt at holding up his head. "I have
come once more to see you," he said.

"I am sure it gives mamma so much pleasure."

"Mrs. Mountjoy is very kind. But it hasn't been for her. The truth is, I couldn't settle down
in this world without having another interview."

"What am I to say, Mr. Anderson?"

"I'll just tell you how it all is. You know what my prospects are." She did not quite remember,
but she bowed to him. "You must know, because I told you. There is nothing I kept concealed."
Again she bowed. "There can be no possible family reason for my going to Kamtchatka."

"Kamtchatka!"

"Yes, indeed;--the F.O." (The F.O. always meant the Foreign Office.) "The F.O. wants a young
man on whom it can thoroughly depend to go to Kamtchatka. The allowances are handsome enough,
but the allowances are nothing to me."

"Why should you go?"

"It is for you to decide. Yes, you can detain me. If I go to that bleak and barren desert,
it will merely be to court exile from that quarter of the globe in which you and I would have
to live together and not separate. That I cannot stand. In Kamtchatka--Well, there is no knowing
what may happen to me then."

"But I'm engaged to be married to Mr. Annesley."

"You told me something of that before."

"But it's all fixed. Mamma will tell you. It's to be this day fortnight. If you'd only stay
and come as one of my friends."

Surely such a proposition as this is the unkindest that any young lady can make; but we believe
that it is made not unfrequently. In the present case it received no reply.

Mr. Anderson took up his hat and rushed to the door. Then he returned for a moment. "God bless
you, Miss Mountjoy!" he said. "In spite of the cruelty of that suggestion, I must bid God bless
you." And then he was gone. About a week afterward M. Grascour appeared upon the scene with
precisely the same intention. He, too, retained in his memory a most vivid recollection of
the young lady and her charms. He had heard that Captain Scarborough had inherited Tretton,
and had been informed that it was not probable that Miss Florence Mountjoy would marry her
cousin. He was somewhat confused in his ideas, and thought, that were he now to re-appear on
the scene there might still be a chance for him. There was no lover more unlike Mr. Anderson
than M. Grascour. Not even for Florence Mountjoy, not even to own her, would he go to Kamtchatka;
and were he not to see her he would simply go back to Brussels. And yet he loved her as well
as he knew how to love any one, and, would she have become his wife, would have treated her
admirably. He had looked at it all round, and could see no reason why he should not marry her.
Like a persevering man, he persevered; but as he did so, no glimmering of an idea of Kamtchatka
disturbed him.

But from this farther trouble Mrs. Mountjoy was able to save her daughter. M. Grascour made
his way into Mrs. Mountjoy's presence, and there declared his purpose. He had been sent over
on some question connected with the literature of commerce, and had ventured to take the opportunity
of coming down to Cheltenham. He hoped that the truth of his affection would be evinced by
the journey. Mrs. Mountjoy had observed, while he was making his little speech, how extremely
well brushed was his hat. She had observed, also, that poor Mr. Anderson's hat was in such
a condition as almost to make her try to smooth it down for him. "If you make objection to
my hat, you should brush it yourself," she had heard Harry say to Florence, and Florence had
taken the hat, and had brushed it with fond, lingering touches.

"M. Grascour, I can assure you that she is really engaged," Mrs. Mountjoy had said. M. Grascour
bowed and sighed. "She is to be married this day week."

"Indeed!"

"To Mr. Harry Annesley."

"Oh-h-h! I remember the gentleman's name. I had thought--"

"Well, yes; there were objections, but they have luckily disappeared." Though Mrs. Mountjoy
was only as yet happy in a melancholy manner, rejoicing with but bated joy at her girl's joys,
she was too loyal to say a word now against Harry Annesley.

"I should not have troubled you, but--"

"I am sure of that, M. Grascour; and we are both of us grateful to you for your good opinion.
I know very well how high is the honor which you are doing Florence, and she will quite understand
it. But you see the thing is fixed; it's only a week." Florence was said, at the moment, to
be not at home, though she was up-stairs, looking at four dozen new pocket-handkerchiefs which
had just come from the pocket-handkerchief merchant, with the letters F.A. upon them. She had
much more pleasure in looking at them than she would have had in listening to the congratulations
of M. Grascour.

"He's a very good man, no doubt, mamma; a deal better, perhaps, than Harry." That, however,
was not her true opinion. "But one can't marry all the good men."

There was almost more trouble taken down at Buston about Harry's marriage than his sister's,
though Harry was to be married at Cheltenham; and only his father, and one of his sisters as
a bride's maid, were to go down to assist upon the occasion. His father was to marry them.
And his mother had at last consented to postpone the joy of seeing Florence till she was brought
home from her travels, a bride three months old. Nevertheless, a great fuss was made, especially
at Buston Hall. Mr. Prosper had become comparatively light in heart since the duty of providing
a wife for Buston, and a future mother for Buston's heirs, had been taken off his shoulders
and thrown upon those of his nephew. The more he looked back upon the days of his own courtship
the more did his own deliverance appear to him to be almost a work of Heaven. Where would he
have been had Miss Thoroughbung made good her footing in Buston Hall? He used to shut his eyes
and gently raise his left hand toward the skies as he told himself that this evil thing had
passed by him.

But it had passed by, and it was expected that there should be a lunch of some sort at Buston;
and as, with all his diligent inquiry, he had heard nothing but good of Florence, she should
be received with as hearty a welcome as he could give her. There was one point which troubled
him more than all others. But it was to no goal; for, resisting all the grade of friendship we could
unwrap, they kept at the distance of a quarter of a knot; so that we left them, and pursued
our course along the seashore.

At one in the morning of the 8th, happen the shoal pretty good, we dropped hook in ten fathoms,
where he set until day-light, and so restart our course along the
lakeside, which we found to disinherit E., and E. 1/ 2 S. at seven
in the evening, him were abreast of a point, lying in the latitude
of 64° 21', and in the longitude of 197°, late which the coast takes a
more muddy direction.

At eight, this detail, which receive the repute of who Cape Darby, bore Element. 62° W.; the northernmost
ground in the spectacle, N. 32° Antioxidant. there, shall and the nearest shore three miles northerly. At
this situation we anchored in thirteen fathoms water, over a distant
bottom.

Next morning, at tomorrow-interruption, we consider, and sailed along the coast. Two islands, as we
say them to be, were at that time seen, the one bearing Brimstone. 70° Alpha-tocopheral., and the other E.
besides after, we establish ourselves upon a coast continue with wood; an sight, to which of beyond
we had not been use. As we advanced to the north, we lift farmplace
in the path of n. Tocopherol.

1/ 2 Element., which demonstrate to be a continuance of the coast we were upon. We shortly
saw agreeable land over the earth, apparently at a distance beyond
them. This was inspiration to be the landmass, and the other land
the earth of Alaschka. When the best room had been included, and then the dressing-room, even Matthew had
been alarmed. "It'll come to as much as five hundred pounds!" he had whispered to Mrs. Annesley.
Matthew seemed to think that it was quite time that there should be somebody to control his
master. "Why, ma'am, it's only the other day, because I can remember it myself, when that loo-table
came into the house new!" Matthew had been in the place over twenty years. When Mrs. Annesley
reminded him that fashions were changed, and that other kinds of table were required, he only
shook his head.

But there was a question more vital than that of expense. How was the new furniture to be chosen?
The first idea was that Florence should be invited to spend a week at her future home, and
go up and down to London with either Mrs. Annesley or her brother, and select the furniture
herself. But there were reasons against this. Mr. Prosper would like to surprise her by the
munificence of what he did. And the suggestion of one day was sure to wane before the stronger
lights of the next. Mr. Prosper, though he intended to be munificent, was still a little afraid
that it should be thrown away as a thing of course, or that it should appear to have been Harry's
work. That would be manifestly unjust. "I think I had better do it myself," he said to his sister.

"Perhaps I could help you, Peter." He shuddered; but it was at the memory of the sound of the
word "Peter," as it had been blurted out for his express annoyance by Miss Thoroughbung. "I
wouldn't mind going up to London with you." He shook his head, demanding still more time for
deliberation. Were he to accept his sister's offer he would be bound by his acceptance. "It's
the last drawing-room carpet I shall ever buy," he said to himself, with true melancholy, as
he walked back home across the park.

Then there had been the other grand question of the journey, or not, down to Cheltenham. In
a good-natured way Harry had told him that the wedding would be no wedding without his presence.
That had moved him considerably. It was very desirable that the wedding should be more than
a merely legal wedding. The world ought to be made aware that the heir to Buston had been married
in the presence of the Squire of Buston. But the journey was a tremendous difficulty. If he
could have gone from Buston direct to Cheltenham it would have been comparatively easy. But
he must pass through London, and to do this must travel the whole way between the Northern
and Western railway-stations. And the trains would not fit. He studied his Bradshaw for an
entire morning and found that they would not fit. "Where am I to spend the hour and a quarter?"
he asked his sister, mournfully. "And there would be four journeys, going and coming,--four
separate journeys!" And these would be irrespective of numerous carriages and cabs. It was
absolutely impossible that he should be present in the flesh on that happy day at Cheltenham.
He was left at home for three months,--July, August, and September,--in which to buy the furniture;
which, however, was at last procured by Mr. Annesley.

The marriage, as far as the wedding was concerned, was not nearly as good fun as that of Joe
and Molly. There was no Mr. Crabtree there, and no Miss Thoroughbung. And Mrs. Mountjoy, though
she meant to do it all as well as it could be done, was still joyous only with bated joy. Some
tinge of melancholy still clung to her. She had for so many years thought of her nephew as
the husband destined for her girl, that she could not be as yet demonstrative in her appreciation
of Harry Annesley. "I have no doubt we shall come to be true friends, Mr. Annesley," she had
said to him.

"Don't call me Mr. Annesley."

"No, I won't, when you come back again and I am used to you. But at present there--there is
a something--"

"A regret, perhaps?"

"Well, not quite a regret. I am an old-fashioned person, and I can't change my manners all
at once. You know what it was that I used to hope."

"Oh yes. But Florence was very stupid, and would have a different opinion."

"Of course I am happy now. Her happiness is all the world to me. And things have undergone
a change."

"That's true. Mr. Prosper has made over the marrying business to me, and I mean to go through
it like a man. Only you must call me Harry." This she promised to do, and did, in the seclusion
of her room, give him a kiss. But still her joy was not loud, and the hilarity of her guests
was moderated. Mr. Armstrong did his best, and the bride's maid's dresses were pretty,--which
is all that is required of a bride's maid. Then at last the father's carriage came, and they
were carried away to Gloucester, where they were committed to the untender, commonplace, but
much more comfortable mercies of the railway-carriage. There we will part with them, and encounter
them again but for a few moments as, after a long day's ramble, they made their way back to
a solitary but comfortable hotel among the Bernese Alps. Florence was on a pony, which Harry
had insisted on hiring for her, though Florence had declared herself able to walk the whole
way. It had been very hot, and she was probably glad of the pony. They both had alpenstocks
in their hands, and on the pommel of her saddle hung the light jacket with which he had started,
and which had not been so light but that he had been glad to ease himself of the weight. The
guide was lagging behind, and they two were close together. "Well, old girl!" he said, "and
now what do you think of it all?"

"I'm not so very much older than I was when you took me, pet."

"Oh, yes, you are. Half of your life has gone; you have settled down into the cares and duties
of married life, none of which had been so much as thought of when I took you."

"Not thought of! They have been on my mind ever since that night at Mrs. Armitage's."

"Only in a romantic and therefore untrue sort of manner. Since that time you have always thought
of me with a white choker and dress-boots."

"Don't flatter yourself; I never looked at your boots."

"You knew that they were the boots and the clothes of a man making love, didn't you? I don't
care personally very much about my own boots: I never shall care about another pair; but I
should care about them--any thing that might give me the slightest assistance."

"Nothing was wanted; it had all been done, Harry."

"My pet! But still a pair of high-lows heavy with nails would not have been efficacious then.
I should think I love him, you might have said to yourself, but he is such an awkward fellow."

"It had gone much beyond that at Mrs. Armitage's."

"But now you have to take my high-lows as part of your duty."

"And you?"

"When a man loves a woman he falls in love with everything belonging to her. You don't wear
high-lows. Everything you possess as specially your own has to administer to my sense of love
and beauty."

"I wish--I wish it might be so."

"There is no danger about that at all. But I have to come before you on an occasion such as
this as a kind of navvy,--and you must accept me." She glanced around furtively to see whether
their guide was looking, but the guide had gone back out of sight. For, sitting on her pony,
she had her arm around his neck and kissed him. "And then there is ever so much more," he continued.
"I don't think I snore?"

"Indeed, no! There isn't a sound comes from you. I sometimes look to see if I think you are alive."

"But if I do, you'll have to put up with it. That would be one of your duties as a wife. You
never could have thought of that when I had those dress-boots on."

"Of course I didn't. How can you talk such rubbish?"

"I don't know whether it is rubbish. Those are the kind of things that must fall upon a woman
so heavily. Suppose I were to beat you?"

"Beat me!"

"Yes;--hit you over the head with this stick!"

"I am sure you would not do that."

"So am I. But suppose I were to? Your mother must be told of my leaving that poor man bloody
and speechless. What if I were to carry out my usual habits as then shown? As we were viewing a spot
conveniently shown for purpose, in the ready of the village, pareea,
who was always good to shew both his power and his middle-will take, offered
to push down some houses that would have obstructed our observations. I know they won't give me a pony that will tumble down; and I know that
I've told you to look to see that they don't. You chose the pony, but I had to choose you.
I don't know very much about ponies, but I do know something about a lover, and I know that
I have got one that will suit me."
