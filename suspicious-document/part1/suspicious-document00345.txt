GENERAL DIRECTIONS.

"Do you teach your pupils how to carve?"

"Please give us a lecture on carving; my husband says he will come if you will."

I have been so frequently addressed in this way that I have decided to publish a manual on
the Art of Carving. Instruction in this art cannot be given at a lecture with any profit to
my pupils or satisfaction to myself. One cannot learn by simply seeing a person carve a few
times. As much as any other art, it requires study; and success is not attainable without much
practice. There are certain rules which should be thoroughly understood; if followed faithfully
in daily practice, they will help more than mere observation.

This manual is not offered as a guide for special occasions, company dinners, etc., nor for
those whose experience renders it unnecessary, or whose means allow them to employ one skilled
in the art. But it is earnestly hoped that the suggestions here offered will aid those who
desire, at their own table in everyday home life, to acquire that ease and perfection of manner
which, however suddenly it may be confronted with obstacles, will be equal to every occasion.

Printed rules for carving are usually accompanied with cuts showing the position of the joint
or fowl on the platter, and having lines indicating the method of cutting. But this will not
be attempted in this manual, as such illustrations seldom prove helpful; for the actual thing
before us bears faint resemblance to the pictures, which give us only the surface, with no
hint of what may be inside.

It is comparatively a slight matter to carve a solid mass of lean meat. It is the bones, tough
gristle, and tendons, that interfere with the easy progress of the knife. To expect any one
to carve well without any conception of the internal structure of what may be placed before
him is as absurd as to expect one to amputate a limb successfully who has no knowledge of human
anatomy.

Some notion of the relative position of bones, joints, fat, tough and tender muscles, is the
first requisite to good carving. All agree that skill in carving may be acquired by practice;
and so it may. Any one can divide a joint if he cut and hack at it long enough, and so learn
after a time just where to make the right cut. But a more satisfactory way is to make a careful
study before the material is cooked, and thus learn the exact position of every joint, bone,
and muscle. Become familiar with a shoulder or a leg of mutton; locate the joints by moving
the bones in the joints, or by cutting it into sections, some time when it is to be used for
a stew. Or remove the bone in the leg by scraping the meat away at either end. Learn to distinguish
the different cuts of meat. The best way to learn about carving poultry and game is to cut
them up for a stew or fricassee, provided care be taken not to chop them, but to disjoint them
skilfully.

Then, when you attempt to carve, do the best you can every time. Never allow yourself to be
careless about it, even should the only spectators be your wife and children. But do not make
your first effort in the art at a company dinner. Every lady should learn the art. There is
no reason why she may not excel in it, as she has every opportunity to study the joint or fowl
before cooking. Strength is not required, so much as neatness and care. A firm, steady hand,
a cool, collected manner, and confidence in one's ability will help greatly. Children also
should be taught this accomplishment, and should be taught it as soon as they can handle a
knife safely. If parents would allow the children to share their duties at the daily family
table, and occasionally when company is present, a graceful manner would soon be acquired.
When called upon to preside over their own homes there would less frequently be heard the apology,
"Father always carved at home, and I have had no practice." The only recollection that I now
have of a dinner at a friend's some years ago is the easy and skilful way a young son of my
hostess presided at the head of the table, while the father occupied the place of guest at
the mother's right hand.

One must learn first of all to carve neatly, without scattering crumbs or splashing gravy over
the cloth or platter; also to cut straight, uniform slices. This may seem an easy matter; but
do we often see pressed beef, tongue, or even bread cut as it should be? Be careful to divide
the material in such a manner that each person may be served equally well. Have you never received
all flank, or a hard dry wing, while another guest had all tenderloin, or the second joint?
After a little experience you can easily distinguish between the choice portions and the inferior.
Lay each portion on the plate with the browned or best side up. Keep it compact, not mussy;
and serve a good portion of meat, not a bone with hardly any meat on it. After all are served,
the portion on the platter should not be left jagged, rough, and sprawling, but should look
inviting enough to tempt one to desire a second portion.

Care should be taken to carve in such a way as to get the best effect. A nice joint is often
made less inviting from having been cut with the grain, while meat of rather poor quality is
made more tender and palatable if divided across the grain. Where the whole of the joint is
not required, learn to carve economically, that it may be left in good shape for another dinner.

After you have learned to do the simplest work neatly and gracefully, much painstaking will
be necessary in acquiring the power to accomplish with elegance the more difficult tasks. For
to reach the highest degree of excellence in the art, one must be able to carve the most difficult
joint with perfect skill and ease.

But after all this study and a great amount of practice failure often happens, and blame is
laid upon the carver which really belongs to some other person,--the butcher, the cook, the
table-girl, or the guest. Not all men who sell meat know or practice the best way of cutting
up meat. Much may be done by the butcher and by the cook to facilitate the work of the carver.
These helps will be noticed more particularly under the head of special dishes.

An essential aid to easy carving, and one often overlooked, is that the platter be large enough
to hold not merely the joint or fowl while whole, but also the several portions as they are
detached.

The joint should be placed in the middle of the platter, in the position indicated under special
directions. There should be sufficient space on either side for the portions of meat as they
are carved; that is, space on the bottom, none of the slices being allowed to hang over the
edge of the dish. If necessary, provide an extra dish. The persistency with which some housekeepers
cling to a small dish for fear the meat will look lost on a larger one often makes successful
carving impossible.

The platter should be placed near the carver, that he may easily reach any part of the joint.

The cook should see that all skewers, strings, etc., be removed before sending the meat or
fish to the table. It is extremely awkward to find one's knife impeded by a bit of twine.

The carver may stand or sit, as suits his convenience. Anything that is done easily is generally
done gracefully, but when one works at a disadvantage awkwardness is always the result.

A very important matter is the condition of the knife. It should have a handle easy to grasp,
a long, thin, sharp, pointed blade, and be of a size adapted to the article to be carved and
to the person using it. A lady or a child will prefer a small knife. Be as particular to have
the knife sharp as to have it bright and clean; and always sharpen it before announcing the
dinner. It is very annoying for a person to be obliged to wait and sharpen the knife, or to
turn the meat round to get it into the right position. Never allow a carving-knife to be used
to cut bread, or for any other than its legitimate purpose.

The fork should be strong, with long tines, and should have a guard.

Place the fork deep enough in the meat so that you can hold it firmly in position. I roll it does
not serve it do not send them see it has been several has been the plates, it is difficult,

"Flank of which
do not remove it do not cut, has removed partly has been the is not
be separated, so, the thickest; and bones than parallel."

 Remember there are only two fillets, or side-bones,
or second joints; if you are the first to be served, do not test the skill of the carver by
preferring a portion difficult to obtain.

Many of these cautions may seem uncalled for, but they have been suggested by personal observation
of their necessity. People of good breeding would never err in any of these ways; but alas,
not all people are well bred, and innate selfishness often crops out in small matters.

The following explicit directions have not been taken from books. They were given to the writer
a few years ago by one who was an adept in the art, who had received her instruction from a
skilful surgeon, and who at her own table gave a practical demonstration of the fact that a
lady can not only "carve decently and in good order," but with ease and elegance.

SPECIAL DIRECTIONS.

TIP OF THE SIRLOIN, OR RIB ROAST.

It is easier to carve this joint by cutting across the ribs, parallel with the backbone, but
that is cutting with the grain; and meat, especially beef, seems more tender if cut across
the grain.

Place it on the platter with the backbone at the right. If the backbones be not removed before
cooking, place the fork in the middle and cut close to the backbone down to the ribs. Shave
off the thick, gristly cord near the backbone, as this, if left on, interferes with cutting
thin slices. Then cut, from the side nearest you, thin uniform slices parallel with the ribs.
Run the knife under and separate them from the bone. Many prefer to remove the bone and skewer
the meat into a roll before cooking. It may then be laid, flesh down, on the dish, and carved
across the top horizontally in thin slices; or if you find it easier, place it with the skin
surface up, and carve down from the flesh side nearest you.

This style of serving is generally preferred, but there are advantages in retaining the bone;
for the thin end when rolled under is not cooked to such a nice degree of crispness, and the
slices are usually larger than desired. Again, the ribs, by keeping the meat in position, secure
for it a clean cut, and not one broken and jagged, and the thin end may be served or not, as
you please.

SIRLOIN ROAST.

The backbone or thickest end should be at the right end of the dish.

Carve a sirloin roast by cutting several thin slices parallel with the ribs. Then cut down
across the ribs near the backbone, and also at the flank end, and separate the slices.

The slices should be as thin as possible and yet remain slices, not shavings. Turn the meat
over and cut out the tenderloin and slice it in the same manner across the grain; or turn the
meat over and remove the tenderloin first. Many prefer to leave the tenderloin to be served
cold. Cut slices of the crisp fat on the flank in the same way, and serve to those who wish
it. This is a part which many dislike, but some persons consider it very choice. Always offer
it unless you know the tastes of those whom you are serving.

THE BACK OF THE RUMP.

A roast from the back of the rump, if cooked without removing the bone, should be placed on
the platter with the backbone on the farther side. Cut first underneath to loosen the meat
from the bone. Then, if the family be large and all the meat is to be used, the slices may
be cut lengthwise; but should only a small quantity be needed, cut crosswise and only from
the small end. It is then in better shape for the second day.

It is more economical to serve the poorer parts the first day, as they are never better than
when hot and freshly cooked. Reserve the more tender meat to be served cold.

FILLET OF BEEF OR TENDERLOIN.

Before cooking, remove all the fat, and every fibre of the tough white membrane. Press it into
shape again and lard it, or cover it with its own fat. If this fibre be not removed, the sharpest
knife will fail to cut through it. Place it on the platter with the larger end at the right;
or if two short fillets be used, place the thickest ends in the middle. Carve from the thickest
part, in thin, uniform slices.

ROUND OF BEEF, FILLET OF VEAL, OR FRICANDEAU OF VEAL.

These are placed on the platter, flesh side up, and carved in horizontal slices, care being
taken to carve evenly, so that the portion remaining may be in good shape. As the whole of
the browned outside comes off with the first slices, divide this into small pieces, to be served
if desired with the rare, juicy, inside slices.

BEEFSTEAK.

It may seem needless to direct one how to carve a sirloin steak, but it sometimes appears to
require more skill than to carve poultry, as those who have been so unfortunate as to receive
only the flank can testify.

I believe most strongly, as a matter of economy, in removing the bone, and any tough membrane
or gristle that will not be eaten, before cooking the steak. If there be a large portion of
the flank, cook that in some other way. With a small, sharp knife cut close to the rib on each
side, round the backbone, and remove the tough white membrane on the edge of the tenderloin.
Leave the fat on the upper edge, and the kidney fat also, or a part of it, if it be very thick.
There need be no waste or escape of juices if the cutting be done quickly, neatly, and just
before cooking. Press the tenderloin--that is, the small portion on the under side of the bone--close
to the upper part, that the shape may not be changed.

In serving place it on the dish with the tenderloin next to the carver. Cut in long narrow
strips from the fat edge down through the tenderloin. Give each person a bit of tenderloin,
upper part, and fat. If the bone be not removed before cooking, remove the tenderloin first
by cutting close to the bone, and divide it into narrow pieces; then remove the meat from the
upper side of the bone and cut in the same manner. A long, narrow strip about as wide as the
steak is thick is much more easily managed on one's plate than a square piece. Serve small
portions, and then, if more be desired, help again.

In carving large rump steaks or round steaks, cut always across the grain, in narrow strips. "'ll soup,"
it state i slip them is, "and, cantaloupes, etc be'it.'metal is there is there will put ICE,

"'weather is steady have served my watermelon,'be stiff, has been

apples to water would be each wait." There was the letter, with kinds
from croûtons. Cup out from the salt, consistency should be served
to quarters on Form.

 When carved in this way the loin and leg are not divided. This is not so economical
as the first method.

LOIN OF MUTTON, LAMB, VEAL, PORK, OR VENISON.

These should always be divided at the joints in the backbone by the butcher; then it is an
easy matter to separate the ribs, serving one to each person, with a portion of the kidney
and fat if desired. But if the butcher neglect to do this, and you have no cleaver with which
to do it, it is better to cut slices down to the ribs parallel with the backbone, as directed
in the saddle of mutton, than to suffer the annoyance of hacking at the joints.

Before cooking a loin of pork, gash through the fat between the ribs; this will give more of
the crisp fat, and will aid in separating the ribs.

SHOULDER OF MUTTON OR VEAL.

Place it on the platter with the thickest part up. From the thickest part cut thin slices,
slanting down to the knuckle; then make several cuts across to the larger end, and remove these
slices from the shoulder-blade. Separate the blade at the shoulder-joint, and remove it. Cut
the meat under the blade in perpendicular slices.

Any part of the forequarter of mutton is more tender and palatable, and more easily carved,
if before cooking it be boned and stuffed. Or it may be boned, rolled, and corned.

FOREQUARTER OF LAMB OR VEAL.

This is a difficult joint for a beginner, but after a little study and practice one may manipulate
it with dexterity. Some time when a lamb stew or fricassee is to be prepared, study the joint
carefully and practice cutting it up, and thus become familiar with the position of the shoulder-blade
joint,--the only one difficult to reach. The backbone should always be disjointed. The ribs
should be divided across the breast and at the junction of the breast-bone, and the butcher
should also remove the shoulder-blade and the bone in the leg. Unless the joint be very young
and tender, it is better to use the breast portion for a stew or fricassee; but when nice and
tender the breast may be roasted with the other portions, as the choice gelatinous morsels
near the breast-bones are preferred by many. This joint consists of three portions,--the shoulder
or knuckle, the breast or brisket, and the ribs. Put it on the platter with the backbone up.
Put the fork in near the knuckle. Cut through the flesh clear round the leg and well up on
the shoulder, but not too far on the breast. With the fork lift the leg away from the shoulder,
cutting in till you come to the joint, after separating which, remove the leg to a separate
dish, to be afterward cut into thin slices through the thickest part. Cut across from left
to right where the ribs have been broken, separating the gristly breast from the upper portion.
Then remove the blade if it has not been done before cooking. Divide each of these portions
between the ribs, and serve a piece of the rib, the breast, or a slice from the leg, as preferred.

NECK OF VEAL.

The vertebra should be disjointed, and the ribs cut on the inside through the bone only, on
the thin end. Place it on the platter with the back up and cut across from left to right, where
the ribs were divided, separating the small ends of the ribs from the thicker upper portion;
then cut between each short rib. Carve from the back down in slanting slices, then slip the
knife under close to the ribs and remove the slices. This gives a larger portion than the cutting
of the slices straight would give, and yet not so large as if each were helped to a whole rib.
Serve a short rib with each slice.

BREAST OF VEAL.

Place it on the dish with the breast-bone or brisket nearest you. Cut off the gristly brisket,
then separate it into sections. Cut the upper part parallel with the ribs, or between each
rib if very small. Slice the sweetbread, and serve a portion of brisket, rib, and sweetbread
to each person.

CALF'S HEAD.

Calf's head served whole is a favorite dish in England, but seldom seen on American tables.
For those who have this preference a few hints about carving may be desirable. Place it on
the platter with the face toward the right. Cut from left to right, through the middle of the
cheek down to the bone, in several parallel slices of medium thickness; then separate them
from the bone. Cut down at the back of the throat and slice the throat sweetbread. With the
point of the knife cut out the gelatinous portion near the eye, and serve to those who desire
it. There is a small portion of delicate lean meat to be found after removing the jawbone.
Some are fond of the palate, which lies under the head. The tongue should be sliced, and a
portion of this and of the brains offered to each person.

ROAST PIG.

This is sometimes partly divided before serving. Cut off the head and divide it through the
middle; then divide through the backbone. Place it on the platter back to back, with half the
head on each end of the dish.

If the pig be very young, it is in better style to serve it whole. Before cooking, truss the
forelegs forward and the hind legs backward. Place the pig on the platter with the head at
the left. Cut off the head, separating the neck-joint with the point of the knife, then cut
through the flesh on either side. Take off the shoulders by cutting in a circle from under
the foreleg round nearly to the backbone and down again. Bend it forward and cut through the
joint. Cut off the hams in the same way. Then split the backbone the entire length and divide
between each rib. Cut slices from the thickest part of the hams and the shoulders. The ribs
are the choice portion, but those who like it at all consider any part of it a delicacy.

HAM.

If the ham is not to be served whole, the simplest and most economical way is to begin near
the smaller end and cut in very thin slices, on each side of the bone. Divide the slices and
arrange them neatly on the dish, one lapping over another, with the fat edge outside.

Where the whole ham is to appear on the table it should be trimmed neatly, and the end of the
bone covered with a paper ruffle. The thickest part should be on the further side of the platter.
Make an incision through the thickest part, a little way from the smaller end. Shave off in
very thin slices, cutting toward the larger end and down to the bone at every slice. The knife
should be very sharp to make a clean cut, and each slice should have a portion of the fat with
the crisp crust. To serve it hot a second day, fill the cavity with a bread stuffing, cover
it with buttered crumbs, and brown it in the oven. If it is to be served cold, brown the crumbs
first and then sprinkle them over the stuffing. If this be done the edges will not dry and
the symmetry of the ham is preserved. Carve as before, toward the larger end, and if more be
needed, cut also from the other side of the bone.

By filling the cavity again with stuffing, a ham may be served as a whole one the third time
and look as inviting as when first served. Should there be two or three inches of the thickest
end left for another serving, saw off the bone, lay the meat flesh side up, with the fat on
the further side of the platter, and carve horizontally in thin slices.

TONGUE.

The centre of the tongue is the choicest portion. Cut across in slices as thin as a wafer.
The tip of the tongue is more delicate when cut lengthwise in thin slices, though this is not
the usual practice.

CORNED BEEF.

Corned beef should be put while hot into a pan or mould, in layers of fat and lean, with the
fibres running the long way of the pan. After pressing it, place it on the platter and slice
thinly from one end. This gives uniform slices, cut across the grain, each one having a fair
proportion of fat and lean.

CHARTREUSE, OR PRESSED MEAT.

Any moulds of meat, either plain or in jelly or rice, should be cut from one end, or in the
middle and toward either end, in uniform slices, the thickness varying with the kind of meat.
Be careful not to break them in serving. If only a part of a slice be desired, divide it neatly.
Help also to the rice or jelly.

TO CUT UP A CHICKEN FOR A STEW OR FRICASSEE.

Nothing is more unsightly and unappetizing than a portion of chicken with the bones chopped
at all sorts of angles, and with splinters of bone in the meat. All bones will separate easily
at the joint when the cord or tendon and gristly portion connecting them have been cut.

After the chicken has been singed and wiped, and the crop removed from the end of the neck,
place it in front of you with the breast up and the neck at the left. With a small sharp knife
make an incision in the thin skin between the inside of the legs and the body. Cut through
the skin only, down toward the right side of the leg, and then on the left. Bend the leg over
toward you, and you will see where the flesh joins the body and also where the joint is, for
the bone will move in the joint. Cut through the flesh close to the body, first on the right
of the joint and then on the left, and as you bend the leg over, cut the cord and gristle in
the joint, and this will free the leg from the body. Find the joint in the leg and divide it
neatly. Work the wing until you see where the joint is, then cut through the flesh on the shoulder,
bend the wing up and cut down through the gristle and cord. Make a straight clean cut, leaving
no jagged edges. Divide the wing in the joint, and then remove the leg and wing from the opposite
side, and divide in the same way. Make an incision in the skin near the vent, cut through the
membrane lying between the breast and the tail down to the backbone on each side, remove the
entrails, and break off the backbone just below the ribs. Separate the side-bones from the
back by cutting close to the backbone from one end to the other on each side. This is a little
difficult to do; and in your first experiment it would be better not to divide it until after
boiling it, as it separates more easily after the connecting gristle has been softened by cooking.
Take off the neck close to the back by cutting through the flesh and twisting or wringing it
until the bone is disjointed.

Cut off the wish-bone in a slanting direction from the front of the breast-bone down to the
shoulder on each side. Cut through the cartilage between the end of the collar-bone and the
breast. Cut between the end of the shoulder-blade and the back down toward the wing-joint,
turn the blade over toward the neck, and cut through the joint.

This joint in the wing, collar-bone, and shoulder-blade is the hardest to separate. Remove
the breast from the back by cutting through the cartilage connecting the ribs; this can be
seen from the inside. The breast should be left whole and the bone removed after stewing; but
if the chicken is to be fried you may remove the bone first.

It is not necessary in boiling a chicken to divide it so minutely, for the wings and legs can
be disjointed, and the side-bones and breast separated from the back more easily after cooking;
but it is valuable practice, and if one learns to do it neatly it will help in carving a boiled
fowl or roast turkey.

In arranging a fricasseed chicken on the platter, put the neck and ribs at the left end of
the dish and the backbone at the right end. Put the breast over the ribs, arrange the wings
on each side of the breast, the second joints next to the side-bones, and cross the ends of
the drumsticks over the tail.

BOILED FOWL OR TURKEY.

Fowls or turkeys for boiling should be trussed with the ends of the legs drawn into the body
through a slit in the skin, and kept in place with a small skewer. Turn the tip of the wing
over on the back. Cut off the neck, not the skin, close to the body, and after putting in the
stuffing, fasten the skin of the neck to the back. Put strips of cloth round it, or pin it
in a cloth, to keep it white and preserve the shape.

In carving, place it on the platter with the head at the left. Put the fork in firmly across
the breast-bone. With the point of the knife cut through the skin near the tail, and lift the
legs out from the inside. Then cut through the skin between the legs and body, bend the leg
over, and cut across through the joint. Cut from the top of the shoulder down toward the body
until the wing-joint is exposed, then cut through this, separating the wing from the body.
Remove the leg and wing from the other side. Shave off a thin slice on the end of the breast
toward each wing-joint, slip the knife under at the top of the breast-bone, and turn back the
wish-bone.

Capons and large fowls may be sliced thinly across the breast in the same manner as a roast
turkey. But if the fowl be small, draw the knife along the edge of the breast-bone on each
side, and lay the meat away from the bone; the fillets will separate easily. Then divide the
meat across the grain. Separate the collar-bone from the breast. Slip the knife under the shoulder-blade,
turn it over, and separate at the joint. Cut through the cartilage connecting the ribs; this
will separate the breast from the back. Now remove the fork from the breast, turn the back
over, place the knife midway, and with the fork lift up the tail end, separating the back from
the body. Place the fork in the middle of the backbone, cut close to the backbone from one
end to the other on each side, freeing the side-bones.

The wing and breast of a boiled fowl are the favorite portions. It is important that the fowl
be cooked just right. If underdone, the joints will not separate readily; and if overdone they
will fall apart so quickly that carving is impossible. Unless the knife be very sharp, and
the work done carefully, the skin of the breast will come off with the leg or wing.

BROILED CHICKEN.

Split the chicken down the back and remove the backbone. If the chicken be very young and tender--and
only such are suitable for broiling--remove the breast-bone before cooking, or cut the bone
through the middle, lengthwise and crosswise from the inside, without cutting into the meat.
In serving, divide through the breast from the neck down, and serve half to each person; or
if a smaller portion be desired, divide each half crosswise through the breast, leaving the
wing on one part and the leg on the other.

If the chicken be large, break the joints of the legs, thighs, and wings, without breaking
through the skin; cut the tendons on the thighs from the inside, cut the membrane on the inside
of the collar-bone and wing-joint, and remove the breast-bone. It was jem the than one containerful

When there are many to be served, take off the leg and wing from each side and slice the whole
of the breast before removing the fork; then divide as required.

It is not often necessary to cut up the whole body of the turkey; but where every scrap of
the meat will be needed, or you wish to exercise your skill, proceed to carve in this manner.

Put the fork in firmly across the middle of the breast-bone. Cut through the skin between the
leg and body. Bend the leg over and cut off at the joint. If the turkey be very tender or overcooked,
the side-bone will separate from the back and come away with the second joint, making it more
difficult to separate the thigh from the side-bone. Cut through the top of the shoulder and
separate the wing at the joint. Cut off the leg and wing from the other side. Carve the breast
on each side, in thin slices, slanting slightly toward the wing. Be careful to take a portion
of crisp outside with each slice. Shave off the crisp skin near the neck, in order to reach
the stuffing. Insert the point of the knife at the front of the breast-bone, turn back the
wish-bone and separate it. Cut through the cartilage on each side, separating the collar-bones
from the breast. Tip the body slightly over and slip the knife under the end of the shoulder-blade;
turn it over toward the wing. Repeat this process on the opposite side. Cut through the cartilage
which divides the ribs, separating the breast-bone from the back. Lay the breast one side and
remove the fork from it. Take the stuffing from the back. Then divide the legs and wings at
the joints. The joint in the leg is not quite in the middle of the bend, but a trifle nearer
the thigh. It requires some practice to strike these joints in the right spot. Cut off the
meat from each side of the bone in the second joint and leg, as these when large are more than
one person requires, and it is inconvenient to have so large bones on one's plate.

It is easier to finish the carving before beginning to serve. An expert carver will have the
whole bird disjointed and literally in pieces with a very few strokes of the knife.

ROAST GOOSE.

A green goose neatly trussed and "done to a turn" looks very tempting on the platter; but there
is so little meat in proportion to the size of the bird that unless it be skilfully carved
only a small number can be served. The breast of a goose is broader and flatter than that of
a turkey. It should be carved in a different manner, although many writers give the same directions
for carving both.

Place it on the platter with the head at the left. Insert the fork firmly across the ridge
of the breast-bone. Begin at the wing and cut down through the meat to the bone, the whole
length of the breast. Cut down in the same way in parallel slices, as thin as can be cut, until
you come to the ridge of the breast-bone. Slip the knife under the meat at the end of the breast,
and remove the slices from the bone. Cut in the same manner on the other side of the breast.
Cut through the skin below the breast, insert a spoon and help to the stuffing. If more be
required, cut the wing off at the joint. Then tip the body over slightly and cut off the leg.
This thigh-joint is tougher, and requires more skill in separating, than the second joint of
a turkey. It lies nearer the backbone. But practice and familiarity with its location will
enable one to strike it accurately. The wish-bone, shoulder-blade, and collar-bone may be removed
according to the directions given for carving roast turkey. Some prefer to remove the wing
and leg before slicing the breast.

ROAST DUCK.

Place it in the same position and carve in the same way as a goose.

Begin at the wing, and cut down to the bone in long thin slices, parallel with the breast-bone;
then remove them from the bone. The breast is the favorite portion; but the "wing of a flyer
and the leg of a swimmer" are esteemed by epicures.

The stuffing is not often desired, but if so it may be found by cutting across below the end
of the breast.

Geese and ducks are seldom entirely cut up at the table, as there is very little meat on the
back. But often from a seemingly bare carcass enough may be obtained to make a savory entrée.

PIGEONS.

These, if small, are served whole. If large, cut through the middle from the neck to the end
of the breast and down through the backbone. The bones are thin, and may easily be divided
with a sharp knife. When smaller portions are required, cut from the shoulder down below the
leg, separating the wing and leg from the body.

PARTRIDGES.

Cut through above the joint of the wing, down below the leg, and remove the wing and leg in
one portion. Cut under the breast from the lower end through the ribs to the neck and remove
the breast entire. Then divide it through the middle, and, if very plump, divide again. When
very small they may be divided through the breast and back into two equal parts.

LARDED GROUSE.

Turn the legs over and free them from the body. Cut slices down to the bone the entire length
of the breast; then slip the knife under and remove the slices. Cut off the wing and leg, and
separate the backbone from the body. There are some morsels on the back which are considered
choice by those who like the peculiar flavor of this game. As this is a dry meat, help generously
to the bread sauce which should always accompany it.

Where this is the principal dish, or where a larger portion is required, divide it through
the breast, as directed for small pigeons.

Woodcock, Snipe, and other Small Birds are usually served whole. But if only a portion be desired,
divide them through the breast.

RABBIT.

A rabbit should be trussed, with the forelegs turned toward the back, and the hind legs forward.
Place it on the platter with the back up and head at the left. Remove the shoulders by cutting
round between them and the body, carrying the knife up nearly to the backbone. Turn them back
and cut through the joint. Remove the hind legs in the same manner. Then place the fork in
the middle of the back and cut several slices from each side of the loin parallel with the
backbone. The loin is the choicest part.

SWEETBREADS, CHOPS, AND CUTLETS.

These are not divided, one being served to each person.

FISH.

A broad silver knife should be used in serving fish. Serve as little of the bone as possible,
and be careful not to break the flakes.

Halibut or Salmon. A middle cut, or thick piece, of halibut or salmon should be placed on the
platter with the skin surface up and the back toward the farther side of the dish. Carve in
thick slices down to the bone, slip the knife under and remove them. Then remove the bone,
and serve the lower portion in the same manner.

A thin slice of halibut should be laid on the platter with the flesh side up. Cut next to the
bone on each side, divide the fish as required, and leave the bone on the platter.

Mackerel, White-fish, etc. These and other thin fish for broiling should be split down the
back before cooking. In serving, divide through the middle lengthwise, and then divide each
half into such portions as may be desired. Be careful not to break or crumble them.

Smelts, Perch, and other small pan-fish are served whole. They should be arranged on the dish
with heads and tails alternating, or in a circle round a silver cup placed in the centre of
the platter and holding the sauce. Or, place two or three on a silver skewer, and serve a skewerful
to each person.

Small slices and rolled fillets of fish are not divided.

BAKED FISH.

Cod, Haddock, Cusk, Blue-fish, Shad, Small Salmon, and Bass. These when served whole may be
carved in a more satisfactory manner if before cooking they are prepared according to the following
directions:

Stuff them and place them upright in the pan instead of on one side. Fish that are broad and
short like shad may be kept in place by propping with stale bread or pared potatoes; but others
that are narrow in proportion to the length may be skewered or tied into the shape of the letter S.

Thread a trussing needle with strong twine, run it through the head and fasten it there; then
bend the head round and draw the needle through the middle of the body. Bend the tail in the
opposite direction, run the needle through near the tail, draw the string tightly and fasten
it. Gash the skin two inches apart on each side. Fish thus prepared will retain its shape until
served.

Place it on the platter with the head at the left and the outward curve on the farther side
of the dish. Make an incision along each side of the backbone the entire length of the fish.
Then cut through the gashes on the side nearest you and lay each portion away from the bone.
Then remove the fish on the farther side of the bone. Raise the bone to reach the stuffing,
and serve a little of the fish, stuffing, and sauce to each person. The skeleton should be
left entire on the platter.

If the fish has been baked in the usual way and placed on the platter on its side, cut across
through to the backbone, but not through it, and serve, apportioning as may be desired. Slip
the knife under and remove the portion from the bone. When the fish is all removed from the
top, remove the backbone, and then divide the lower portion.

SCALLOPED DISHES, MEAT PIES, ENTRÉES, ETC.

Meats and fish which have the sauce on the same dish require special care in serving, that
they may present a neat rather than a sloppy appearance on the plate. A drop of gravy on the
edge of the plate will offend a fastidious taste.

Scalloped Dishes, or anything with a crust of crumbs, should be served with a spoon.

Meat Pies, with a pastry crust, require a broad knife and spoon. Put the portion on the plate
neatly, with the crust or browned side up.

Poached Eggs, Quails, and other Meats on Toast. A broad knife should be used in helping to
these dishes. Take up the toast carefully, and lay it on the plate without displacing the egg
or bird.

SALADS.

The most tasteful way of arranging meat-salads or fish-salads is with whole, fresh, lettuce-leaves.
Put two or more leaves together on the platter, and in the nest or dish thus made lay a spoonful
of the salad, with the Mayonnaise on the top. In serving, slip the spoon or broad knife under
the leaves and keep them in place with the fork. Put the salad on the plate carefully, in the
same position, not tipped over. Or you may have a border of fresh lettuce-leaves in the salad-dish.
With the fork lay one or two leaves on the plate, and then put a spoonful of salad on the leaves.
In this way each person has the Mayonnaise on the top; the lettuce is underneath and fresh
and crisp, instead of wilted, as it would be if all of it were mixed with the salad.

VEGETABLES.

In serving vegetables, take up a neat, rounding spoonful. Lay them on the bottom of the plate,
not on the rim or edge. Where there are several kinds, do not let them touch each other on
the plate.

Serve, on separate dishes, fritters with a sweet sauce, peas, tomatoes, or any vegetable with
much liquid.

Asparagus on Toast is a dish that one often sees served very awkwardly. Use a square or rectangular
platter rather than one narrow at the ends.

The bread for the toast should be cut long and narrow, rather than square, and should be laid,
not lengthwise, but across the platter. Lay the asparagus in the same direction, the tips all
at the farther side. Put the knife, which should be broad and long, under the toast, and keep
the asparagus in place with the fork. You will find it much easier to serve than when arranged
in the usual way.

Macaroni as often prepared is another dish which it is not easy to serve neatly. "how many Dining
among yourself are in this school?"

He was not merely, we is written of peruse, we give school, and directions,
she was written to London.

"ill," her state i suggest we handle, "'calciferol have them cognize i'study,'cook. It am the kitchen."

Cantaloupes, if small, are sometimes served cut in halves. If large, divide from end to end
in nature's lines of depression.

THE THICKNESS OF SLICES.

By "very thin slices of meat" we mean slices less than an eighth of an inch thick.

"Thin slices" are from one eighth of an inch to three sixteenths of an inch in thickness.

Slices of "medium thickness" are one quarter of an inch.

Bread for dinner should be cut in slices one inch and a half thick, and each slice should be
divided across into three or four long pieces, according to the width of the slice.

For tea, cut slices three eighths of an inch thick, and for toast, one quarter of an inch.

Thick loaves of cake should be cut in slices from three fourths of an inch to an inch thick,
and divided once. Cut loaves of medium thickness in pieces as broad as the cake is thick, and
divide them once. Thin sheets of cake should be cut in rectangular pieces twice as broad as
the cake is thick. Then divide once, or even twice, if the sheet be very wide. Layer cakes
baked in round pans are usually divided into triangular pieces; but they are less suggestive
of baker's Washington pie, which is so offensively common, if the edges be trimmed in such
a way as to leave a square. Then cut this square into smaller squares or rectangles.

UTENSILS FOR CARVING AND SERVING.

In any first-class cutlery store you will find knives for each special kind of carving. If
your purse will permit the indulgence, it will be convenient to have a breakfast-carver, a
slicer, a jointer, a game-carver, and a pair of game-scissors. But if you can afford to have
only one, you will find a medium-sized meat-carver the knife best adapted to all varieties
of carving. The blade should be about nine inches long and one inch and a quarter wide, slightly
curved, and tapering to a point.

The fork should have two slender curving tines about three eighths of an inch apart and two
and a half inches long, and should have a guard.

A breakfast or steak carver is of the same general shape, but the handle is smaller, and the
blade is six or seven inches long. A slicer for roasts has a wide, straight blade, twelve inches
long, and rounded instead of pointed at the end. This is especially convenient for carving
thin slices from any large roasts, or other varieties of solid meat. The width of the blade
helps to steady the meat, and its great length enables one to cut with a single, long, smooth
stroke through the entire surface. With a knife having a short blade a sort of sawing motion
would be made, and the slice would be jagged. As there are no joints to separate, a point on
the blade is unnecessary.

A jointer is another form of carver, useful where the joints are so large or so difficult to
separate that considerable strength is required. The handle has a crook or guard on the end
to enable the carver to grasp it more securely and use all the strength necessary.

A game-carver has a small, narrow, pointed blade; but the shape and length of the handle is
the distinguishing feature. The handle should be long enough to reach from the tip of the forefinger
to an inch beyond the back side of the hand, so that the edge of the hand about an inch above
the wrist rests against the handle of the carver. In dividing a difficult joint, the manipulation
should be made, not by turning the hand, but by turning the knife with the fingers. In this
way the position of the point of the blade can be more easily changed as the joint may require.
The handle of the carving-knife supports the hand of the carver.

Game-scissors have handles like scissors; the two short blades are quite deeply curved, something
like the blade of a pruning-knife, making the cutting-power greater. This enables the person
using them to cut through quite large bones in tough joints which would otherwise be quite
difficult to separate.

Another form of jointer has two blades, one shorter than the other, and a round handle divided
the entire length, with a spring in the end next the blade. When the handle is closed, the
blades are together and the outer edge of the longer blade is used like a knife for cutting
the meat. By opening the handle the curving edges of the blades are used like scissors for
cutting the bones.

There are various styles of steels or knife-sharpeners, but the one now in my possession is
the best I have ever seen.

It is a four-sided bar of steel, about three eighths of an inch wide and thick, and eight inches
long, having the four sides deeply grooved, thus making the edges very prominent. These edges
are so sharp that but little pressure of the knife on the steel is required. The handle has
a large guard to protect the left hand from the edge of the blade.

But few people know how to use a steel properly. It is difficult to describe the process,--so
easy to a natural mechanic and so awkward to others,--or to instruct one in the knack of it,
by mere description. Hold the steel firmly in the left hand. Let the edge of the knife near
the handle rest on the steel, the back of the knife raised slightly at an angle of about 30°.
Draw the knife along lightly but steadily, always at the same angle, the entire length of the
blade. Then pass the knife under the steel and draw the other surface along the opposite edge
of the steel, from the handle to the point, at the same angle. Repeat these alternate motions
the entire length of the blade, not on the point merely, until you have an edge.

Some persons prefer to turn the knife over, drawing it first from the left hand and then toward
it, sharpening each surface alternately on the same edge of the steel. This is more difficult
to do, as you cannot so surely keep the blade at the same angle,--and this is the most important
point. If held at any other than the proper angle, either no edge is made, or it is taken off
as soon as obtained.

It is bewildering, if one has any intention of buying, to examine the assortment of spoons,
knives, forks, etc., displayed at the silversmith's.

There are ladles for soups, sauces, gravy, and cream; shovels for sugar and salt, and scoops
for cheese; tongs for sugar, pickles, olives, and asparagus; spoons for sugar, jelly, fruit,
sauces, salads, vegetables, and macaroni; slicers for ice-cream, cake, and jelly; knives for
fish, pie, cake, and fruit; forks for fish, oysters, pickles, olives, salad, and asparagus;
scissors for grapes and raisins; crackers and picks for nuts; and rests for the carving knife
and fork. Some of these are really useful; some as little so as many of the hundred and one
novelties designed particularly for wedding gifts. But in neat and careful serving it is essential
to have a soup-ladle, a gravy or sauce ladle, a pair of tongs or shells for block sugar, a
slender-tined silver fork for pickles, a plentiful supply of large and medium-sized spoons,
a carving-rest, a crumb-scraper, and at least one broad silver knife and fork, which if occasion
requires may do duty at several courses.

LAST BUT NOT LEAST.

In offering a second portion of anything do not remind one that he has already been helped.

"Can't I give you another piece of meat or pie?" "Won't you have some more tea or pudding?"
Expressions like these are frequently heard.

It is in far better taste to say, "Will you have some hot coffee?" "May I give you some of
the salad?" "Let me help you to this choice portion."

We trust none of our readers will regard this suggestion as trivial. For, concerning kindness,
we know that perfection is no trifle. It is the essence of that second commandment which we
are divinely told is like "the first of all the commandments;" and it cannot be attained without
assiduous attention to all the minor words and the common acts of life.

A SELECTION FROM SOME OF THE MANY NOTICES BY THE PRESS.

"Mrs. Lincoln, nothing daunted by the legion of cook-books already in existence, thinks there
is room for one more. Her handsome and serviceable-looking volume seems to contain everything
essential to a complete understanding of the culinary art. The Introduction of thirty-five
pages discusses such subjects as cooking in general, fire, fuel, management of a stove, the
various processes of boiling, stewing, baking, frying, roasting, and broiling, with full explanation
of the chemical theory underlying each and distinguishing them; also hints on measuring and
mixing, with tables of weights, measures, and proportions; of time in cooking various articles,
and of average cost of material. One who can learn nothing from this very instructive Introduction
must be well-informed indeed. Following this comes an elaborate and exhaustive chapter on bread-making
in all its steps and phases. To this important topic some seventy pages are devoted. And so
on through the whole range of viands. Exactness, plainness, thoroughness, seem to characterize
all the author's teachings. No point is neglected, and directions are given for both necessary
and luxurious dishes. There are chapters on cooking for invalids, the dining-room, care of
kitchen utensils, etc. There is also a valuable outline of study for teachers taking up the
chemical properties of food, and the physiological functions of digestion, absorption, nutrition,
etc. Add the miscellaneous questions for examination, the topics and illustrations for lectures
on cookery, list of utensils needed in a cooking-school, an explanation of foreign terms used
in cookery, a classified and an alphabetical index,--and you have what must be considered as
complete a work of its kind as has yet appeared."--Mirror, Springfield, Ill.

"In answer to the question, 'What does cookery mean?' Mr. Ruskin says: 'It means the knowledge
of Circe and Medea, and of Calypso and of Helen, and of Rebekah and of all the Queens of Sheba. SOURCES

 The book is admirably
arranged, and is supplied with the most perfect indexes we have ever seen in any work of the
kind"--The Christian Union.

"Mrs. Lincoln has written a cook-book; really written one, not made merely a compilation of
receipts,--that sort of mechanical work any one can do who has patience enough to search for
the rules, and system enough to arrange them. Mrs. Lincoln's book is written out of the experience
of life, both as a housekeeper and a teacher. Her long experience as principal of the Boston
Cooking-School has enabled her to find out just what it is that people most want and need to
know. I have no hesitation in recommending Mrs. Lincoln's as the best cook-book, in all respects,
of any I have seen. It is exactly fitted for use as a family authority, in that it is the work,
not of a theorizer, but of a woman who knows what she is talking about. It is the very common-sense
of the science of cookery."--Extracts from Sallie Joy White's letters in Philadelphia and Portland
papers.

"Mrs. Lincoln's 'Boston Cook-Book' is a characteristically American, not to say Yankee, production.
Boston productions are nothing if not profound, and even this cookery manual must begin with
a definition, a pinch of philology, and the culinary chemistry of heat, cold, water, air, and
drying.... But a touch of the blue-stocking has never been harmful to cookery. This book is
as deft as it is fundamental. It is so perfectly and generously up to everything culinary,
that it cannot help spilling over a little into sciences and philosophy. It is the trimmest,
best arranged, best illustrated, most intelligible, manual of cookery as a high art, and as
an economic art, that has appeared."--Independent.

"It is a pleasure to be able to give a man or a book unqualified praise. We have no fear in
saying that Mrs. Lincoln's work is the best and most practical cook-book of its kind that has
ever appeared. It does not emanate from the chef of some queen's or nobleman's cuisine, but
it tells in the most simple and practical and exact way those little things which women ought
to know, but have generally to learn by sad experience. It is a book which ought to be in every
household."--Philadelphia Press.

"The 'Boston Cook-Book' has a special recommendation. The author, Mrs. Lincoln, was early trained
to a love for all household work. That precious experience is a thing for which a cooking-school
is no manner of substitute, while it is just the thing for professional training to build upon,
widen, and correct. Mrs. Lincoln's book is practical, and though there is much of theory, it
gives proof of being based less upon theory and much upon experiment. The book is handsomely
gotten up, and will ere long attest its usefulness in better food better prepared, and therefore
better digested, in many homes."--Leader.

"It is the embodiment of the actual experience and observation of a woman who has learned and
employed superior domestic methods. It is the outcome of Mrs. Lincoln's conscientious and successful
labors for the development of practical cooking. It is to be recommended for its usefulness
in point of receipts of moderate cost and quantity, in its variety, its comprehensiveness,
and for the excellence of its typographical form."--Boston Transcript.

"The instruction given by Mrs. Lincoln at the Boston Cooking-School is so widely and favorably
known for its thoroughness and attention to scientific and economical principles, that a cook-book
embodying these ideas and principles will be considered a great gain to the housekeeping department.
In care and excellence, her book illustrates the modern advance in home cooking."--Boston Journal.

"The book needs no other raison d'être than its own excellence. Every housekeeper in the land
would be fortunate to have upon her shelf a copy of Mrs. Lincoln's work."--Boston Courier.

"Mrs. Lincoln's book contains in one volume what most other cook-books contain in three; and
its directions are always terse and to the point. It is a thoroughly practical book, and teaches
us all how to live well and wisely every day in the year."--The Beacon.

"The most valuable feature of Mrs. Lincoln's Cook-Book is, without doubt, the application of
scientific knowledge to the culinary art. Mrs. Lincoln has the gift of teaching, and its use
in this connection is worthy of the warmest commendation. She has made the necessary explanations
in a very lucid and succinct manner. To the thousands of intelligent housekeepers who recognize
the importance of the art of the kitchen, this book will be a boon."--Eclectic.

"The book, although at first sight it seems no larger than other cook-books, has over five
hundred pages, and takes up the minutest details of housekeeping. Having examined all the standard
cook-books now in the market, this seems superior to all. There is so much in this that is
not found in other cook-books, that it is equal to a small library in itself."--Extracts from
Anna Barrow's letters in Oxford and Portland papers.

"We have at last from Boston something better than the Emersonian philosophy or the learning
of Harvard,--something that will contribute more to human health, and consequently to human
happiness; and that is, a good, practical cook-book, with illustrations.... We commend Mrs.
Lincoln's volume heartily, and wish it might make a part of every bridal outfit."--The Churchman.

"For plain, practical, and at the same time scientific treatment of a difficult subject, commend
us to Mrs. Lincoln's 'Boston Cook-Book.' No better book has appeared to keep pace with the
wholesome advance of culinary art, as practiced in the common-sense cooking-school."--Toledo.

"It combines whatever is best in those which have gone before, with improvements and refinements
peculiar to itself. It is so complete and admirable in its various departments, that it seems
to fill every requirement. How soon it will be rivalled or superseded it is unsafe to predict;
but for the present we may commend it as in every respect unsurpassed."--The Dial.

"The volume is a compound of information on every household matter; well arranged, clearly
written, and attractively made up. Of the many valuable cook-books, not one better deserves
a place, or is more likely to secure and hold it."--Helen Campbell.

"The possession of your cook-book has made me quite beside myself. I prize it highly, not only
for personal reasons, but because of its real worth. I feel so safe with it as a guide, and
if I abide by its rules and laws no harm can befall me."--Adeline Miller, a former pupil, Atlanta,
Georgia.

"One need only glance over the pages of Mrs Lincoln's Cook-Book to realize the fact of her
aptness in scholarship."--Alta, San Francisco.

"Mrs. Lincoln brings not only the fruits of a long experience to the preparation of her work,
but a great amount of scientific research, so that the book is really a mine of information
in its way."--The Post, Washington.

"It is one of the most interesting treatises on cooking and housework that we have ever read.
It contains much useful information to the general reader, and is one we would recommend to
every housekeeper."--Saratoga Sentinel.
