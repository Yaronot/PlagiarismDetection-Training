If the other islands had seemed beautiful to him, Cuba seemed like heaven itself.  The mountains
grandly rising in the interior, the noble rivers and long sweeping plains, the headlands melting
into the clear water, and the gorgeous colours and flowers and birds and insects on land acted
like a charm on Columbus and his sailors.  As they entered the river they lowered a boat in
order to go ahead and sound for an anchorage; and two native canoes put off from the shore,
but, when they saw the boat approaching, fled again.  The Admiral landed and found two empty
houses containing nets and hooks and fishing-lines, and one of the strange silent dogs, such
as they had encountered on the other island--dogs that pricked their ears and wagged their
tails, but that never barked.  The Admiral, in spite of his greed for gold and his anxiety
to "free" the people of the island, was now acting much more discreetly, and with the genuine
good sense which he always possessed and which was only sometimes obscured.  He would not allow
anything in the empty houses to be disturbed or taken away, and whenever he saw the natives
he tried to show them that he intended to do them no harm, and to win their good will by making
them presents of beads and toys for which he would take no return. As he went on up the river
the scenery became more and more enchanting, so that he felt quite unhappy at not being able
to express all the wonders and beauties that he saw.  In the pure air and under the serene
blue of the sky those matchless hues of blossom and foliage threw a rainbow-coloured garment
on either bank of the river; the flamingoes, the parrots and woodpeckers and humming-birds
calling to one another and flying among the tree-tops, made the upper air also seem alive and
shot with all the colours of the rainbow.  Humble Christopher, walking amid these gorgeous
scenes, awed and solemnised by the strangeness and magnificence of nature around him, tries
to identify something that he knows; and thinks, that amid all these strange chorusings of
unknown birds, he hears the familiar note of a nightingale.  Amid all his raptures, however,
the main chance is not forgotten; everything that he sees he translates into some terms of
practical utility.  Just as on the voyage out every seaweed or fish or flying bird that he
saw was hailed by him as a sign that land was near, so amid the beauty of this virgin world
everything that he sees is taken to indicate either that he is close upon the track of the
gold, or that he must be in Cipango, or that the natives will be easy to convert to Christianity.
In the fragrance of the woods of Cuba, Columbus thought that he smelled Oriental spices, which
Marco Polo had described as abounding in Cipango; when he walked by the shore and saw the shells
of pearl oysters, he believed the island to be loaded with pearls and precious stones; when
he saw a scrap of tinsel or bright metal adorning a native, he argued that there was a gold
mine close at hand.  And so he went on in an increasing whirl of bewildering enchantment from
anchorage to anchorage and from island to island, always being led on by that yellow will o'-the-wisp,
gold, and always believing that the wealth of the Orient would be his on the morrow.  As he
coasted along towards the west he entered the river which he called Rio de Mares. He found
a large village here full of palm-branch houses furnished with chairs and hammocks and adorned
with wooden masks and statues; but in spite of his gentleness and offer of gifts the inhabitants
all fled to the mountains, while he and his men walked curiously through the deserted houses.

On Tuesday, October 30th, Martin Alonso Pinzon, whose communications the Admiral was by this
time beginning to dread, came with some exciting news.  It seemed that the Indians from San
Salvador who were on board the Pinta had told him that beyond the promontory, named by Columbus
the Cape of Palms, there was a river, four days' journey upon which would bring one to the
city of Cuba, which was very rich and large and abounded with gold; and that the king of that
country was at war with a monarch whom they called Cami, and whom Pinzon identified with the
Great Khan.  More than this, these natives assured him that the land they were on at present
was the mainland itself, and that they could not be very far from Cathay.  Columbus for once
found himself in agreement with Martin Alonso. The well-thumbed copy of Marco Polo was doubtless
brought out, and abundant evidence found in it; and it was decided to despatch a little embassy
to this city in order to gain information about its position and wealth.  When they continued
their course, however, and rounded the cape, no river appeared; they sailed on, and yet promontory
after promontory was opened ahead of them; and as the wind turned against them and the weather
was very threatening they decided to turn back and anchor again in the Rio de Mares.

Columbus was now, as he thought, hot upon the track of the Great Khan himself; and on the first
of November he sent boats ashore and told the sailors to get information from the houses; but
the inhabitants fled shyly into the woods.  Having once postulated the existence of the Great
Khan in this immediate territory Columbus, as his habit was, found that everything fitted with
the theory; and he actually took the flight of the natives, although it had occurred on a dozen
other occasions, as a proof that they mistook his bands of men for marauding expeditions despatched
by the great monarch himself.  He therefore recalled them, and sent a boat ashore with an Indian
interpreter who, standing in the boat at the edge of the water, called upon the natives to
draw near, and harangued them.  He assured them of the peaceable intentions of the great Admiral,
and that he had nothing whatever to do with the Great Khan; which cannot very greatly have
thrilled the Cubans, who knew no more about the Great Khan than they did about Columbus.  The
interpreter then swam ashore and was well received; so well, that in the evening some sixteen
canoes came off to the ships bringing cotton yarn and spears for traffic.  Columbus, with great
astuteness, forbade any trading in cotton or indeed in anything at all except gold, hoping
by this means to make the natives produce their treasures; and he would no doubt have been
successful if the natives had possessed any gold, but as the poor wretches had nothing but
the naked skins they stood up in, and the few spears and pots and rolls of cotton that they
were offering, the Admiral's astuteness was for once thrown away.  There was one man, however,
with a silver ring in his nose, who was understood to say that the king lived four days' journey
in the interior, and that messengers had been sent to him to tell him of the arrival of the
strange ships; which messengers would doubtless soon return bringing merchants with them to
trade with the ships.  If this native was lying he showed great ingenuity in inventing the
kind of story that his questioners wanted; but it is more likely that his utterances were interpreted
by Columbus in the light of his own ardent beliefs.  At any rate it was decided to send at
once a couple of envoys to this great city, and not to wait for the arrival of the merchants.
Two Spaniards, Rodrigo de Jerez and Luis de Torres, the interpreter to the expedition --who
had so far found little use for his Hebrew and Chaldean--were chosen; and with them were sent
two Indians, one from San Salvador and the other a local native who went as guide.  Red caps
and beads and hawks' bells were duly provided, and a message for the king was given to them
telling him that Columbus was waiting with letters and presents from Spanish sovereigns, which
he was to deliver personally.  After the envoys had departed, Columbus, whose ships were anchored
in a large basin of deep water with a clean and steep beach, decided to take the opportunity
of having the vessels careened.  Their hulls were covered with shell and weed; the caulking,
which had been dishonestly done at Palos, had also to be attended to; so the ships were beached
and hove down one at a time --an unnecessary precaution, as it turned out, for there was no
sign of treachery on the part of the natives. {163a} This missives is almost fractional the distance

the gild and bore likely lived confused en route.  While the work on the ships was going
forward he employed himself in his usual way, going ashore, examining the trees and vegetables
and fruits, and holding such communication as he was able with the natives.  He was up every
morning at dawn, at one time directing the work of his men, at another going ashore after some
birds that he had seen; and as dawn comes early in those islands his day was probably a long
one, and it is likely that he was in bed soon after dark. Speaking to Duclos, Grimm said "Let's
not become sentimental, for that would be silly." As Grimm played with the dogs, he turned to
Mademoiselle de Camargo and asked,"when was the time of short petticoats? That is one of the
points of our dispute."  "Why did the man not get it all from him?"
says greedy Columbus.  "Because of the prohibition of the Admiral's that no one should do any
trading," says Martin Alonso, and conceives himself to have scored; for truly these two men
do not love one another.  The boatswain of the Pinta, adds Martin Alonso, has found whole trees
of it.  "The Admiral then went there and found that it was not cinnamon."  The Admiral was
omnipotent; if he had said that it was manna they would have had to make it so, and as he chose
to say that it was not cinnamon, we must take his word for it, as Martin Alonso certainly had
to do; so that it was the Admiral who scored this time. "Oh isn't she sweet!" she said, thinking
that she should present her with some kind of special gift. Floating just above the little
one's head she declared that the child will marry whoever she chooses
and live happily ever after. 
All of the other fairies found this
quite astonishing.  Columbus then showed them
some gold and pearls; and "certain old men" replied that in a place they called Bo-No there
was any amount of gold; the people wore it in their ears and on their arms and legs, and there
were pearls also, and large ships and merchandise--all to the south-east.  Finding this information,
which was probably entirely untrue and merely a polite effort to do what was expected of them,
well received, the natives added that "a long distance from there, there were men with one
eye, and other men with dogs' snouts who ate men, and that when they caught a man they beheaded
him and drank his blood" .  .  . The estimation of the clearness of quicksilver from air can
