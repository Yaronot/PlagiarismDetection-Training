This Rajah, Ghalib Jung, is now a great favourite with the minister, and no man manifests a
stronger disposition to make his influence subservient to his own interest and that of his
family. By fraud and violence, and collusion with the officers who have charge of districts
and require his aid at Court, he seizes upon the best lands of his weaker neighbours, in the
same manner as his namesake, Rajah Dursun Sing, used to do; and of the money which he receives
for contracts of various kinds, he appropriates by far the greater part to himself. He is often
sent out, with a considerable force, to adjust disputes between landholders and local authorities,
and he decides in favour of the party most able and willing to pay, under the assurance that,
if called to account, he will be able to clear himself, by giving a share of what he gets to
those who send and support him. He commands a large body of mounted and foot police, and he
is often ordered to go and send detachments in pursuit of daring offenders, particularly those
who have given offence to the British authorities. In such cases he generally succeeds in arresting
and bringing in some of the offenders; but he as often seizes the landholders and others who
may have given them shelter, intentionally or otherwise; and, after extorting from them as
much as they can be made to pay, lets them go. He is not, of course, very particular as to
the quantity or quality of the evidence forthcoming to prove that a person able to pay has
intentionally screened the offenders from justice.

Rajah Ghalib Jung was the superintendent of the City Police, and commandant of a Brigade of
Infantry, and a prime favourite of the King, Nuseer-od Deen Hyder, for two years, up to November
1835. He had many other employments, was always in attendance upon the King, and was much liked
by him, because he saw his orders carried into immediate effect, without any regard to the
rank or sufferings of the persons whom they were to affect. For these two years he was one
of the most intimate companions of his sovereign, in his festivities and most private debaucheries.
He became cordially detested throughout the city for his reckless severity, and still more
throughout the Court, for the fearless manner in which he spoke to the King of the malversation
and peculations of the minister and all the Court favourites who were not in his interest. A discipline
was promote by ruler and polity of which eld. In England, case, reputation. During interval drs., Victim,

 This rule of primogeniture is, however, often
broken through during the lifetime of the father, who, having more of natural affection than
family pride, divides the lands between his sons. After his death they submit to this division,
and take their respective shares, to descend to their children, by the law of primogeniture,
or be again subdivided as may seem to them best; or they fight it out among themselves, till
the strongest gets all. Among landholders of the smallest class, whether Hindoos or Mahommedans,
the lands are subdivided according to the ordinary law of inheritance.

Our army and other public establishments form a great "safety-valve" for Oude, and save it
from a vast deal of fighting for shares in land, and the disorders that always attend it. Younger
brothers enlist in our regiments, or find employment in our civil establishments, and leave
their wives and children under the protection of the elder brother, who manages the family
estate for the common good. They send the greater part of their pay to him for their subsistence,
and feel assured that he will see that they are provided for, should they lose their lives
in our service. From the single district of Byswara in Oude, sixteen thousand men were, it
is said, found to be so serving in our army and other establishments; and from Bunoda, which
adjoins it to the east, fifteen thousand, on an inquiry ordered to be made by Ghazee-od Deen
Hyder some twenty- five years ago.

The family of Dursun Sing, like good landholders in all parts of Oude, assigned small patches
of land to substantial cultivators, merchants, shopkeepers, and others, whom it is useful to
retain in their estates, for the purpose of planting small groves of mango and other trees,
as local ties. They prepare the well and plant the trees, and then make over the land to a
gardener or other good cultivator, to be tilled for his own profit, on condition that he water
the trees, and take care to preserve them from frost during the cold season, and from rats,
white ants, and other enemies; and form terraces round them, where the water lies much on the
surface during the rains, so that it may not reach and injure the bark. The land yields crops
till the trees grow large and cover it with their shade, by which time they are independent
of irrigation, and begin to bear fruit. The crops do not thrive under the shade of the trees,
and the lands they cover cease to be of any value for tillage. The stems and foliage of the
trees, no doubt, deprive the crops of the moisture, carbonic gas and ammonia, they require
from the atmosphere. They are, generally, watered from six to ten years. These groves form
a valuable local tie for the cultivators and other useful tenants. No man dare to molest them
or their descendants, in the possession of their well and grove, without incurring, at least,
the odium of society; and, according to their notion, the anger of their gods.

The cultivators always point out to them, in asserting their rights to the lands they hold;
and reside and cultivate in the village, under circumstances that would drive them away, had
they no such ties to retain them. They feel a-great pride in them; and all good landlords feel
the same in having their villages filled with tenants who have such ties.

December 21, 1849.--Bhurteepoor, ten miles, almost all the way through the estate of Maun Sing.
No lands could be better cultivated than they are all the way, or better studded with groves
and beautiful single trees. The villages and hamlets along the road are numerous, and filled
with cultivators of the gardener and other good classes, who seem happy and contented. The
season has been favourable, and the crops are all fine, and of great variety. Sugar- cane abounds,
but no mills are, as yet, at work. We passed through, and by three or four villages, that have
been lately taken from Maun Sing, and made over to farmers by the local authorities, under
instructions from Court; but they are not so well cultivated, as those which he retains. The
cultivators and inhabitants generally do not appear to enjoy the same protection or security
in the engagements they make. The soil is everywhere good, the water near the surface, and
the climate excellent. The soil is here called doomuteea, and adapted to all kinds of tillage.

I should mention, with regard to the subdivision of landed property, that the Rajahs and tallookdars,
among whom the law of primogeniture prevails, consider their estates as principalities, or
reeasuts. When any Rajah, or tallookdar, during his lifetime, assigns portions of the land
to his sons, brothers, or other members of the family, they are separated from the reeasut,
or principality, and are subdivided as they descend from generation to generation, by the ordinary
Hindoo or Mahommedan law of inheritance. This is the case with portions of the estate of the
Rajah of Korwar, in the Sultanpoor district, one of the oldest Hindoo principalities in Oude,
which are now held by his cousins, nephews, &c., near this place, Bhurteepoor.*

[* Sunkur Sing, of Korwar, had four sons: first, Dooneeaput died without issue; second, Sookraj
Sing, whose grandson, Madhoo Persaud, is now the Rajah; third, Bureear Sing, who got from his
brother lands yielding forty thousand rupees a-year out of the principality. They are now held
by his son, Jydut; fourth, Znbar Sing, who got from his brother lands yielding nineteen thousand
rupees a-year, which are now held by his son, Moheser Persaud. Sunkir Sing was the second brother,
but his elder brother died without issue.]

Dooneeaput succeeded to the reeasut on the death of his uncle, the Rajah, who died without
issue; and he bestowed portions of the estate on his brothers, Burear and Zubur Sing, which
their descendants enjoy, but which do not go to the eldest son, by the law of primogeniture.
He was succeeded by his brother, Sookraj, whose grandson, Madhoo Persaud, now reigns as Rajah,
and has the undivided possession of the lands belonging to this branch. All the descendants
of his grandfather, Sookraj, and their widows and orphans, have a right to protection and support
from him, and to nothing more. Jydut, who now holds the lands, yielding forty thousand rupees
a-year, called upon me, this morning, and gave me this history of his family. The Rajah himself
is in camp, and came to visit me this afternoon.

It is interesting and pleasing to see a large, well-controlled camp, moving in a long line
through a narrow road or pathway, over plains, covered with so rich a variety of crops, and
studded with such magnificent evergreen trees. The solitary mango-tree, in a field of corn,
seems to exult in its position-to grow taller and spread wider its branches and rich foliage,
in situations where they can be seen to so much advantage. The peepul and bargut trees, which,
when entire, are still more ornamental, are everywhere torn to pieces and disfigured by the
camels and elephants, buffaloes and bullocks, that feed upon their foliage and tender branches.
There are a great many mhowa, tamarind, and other fine trees, upon which they do not feed,
to assist the mango in giving beauty to the landscape.

 These deputies are the
men who adjust all the nuzuranas, or unauthorized gratuities, to be paid to the minister.

[* On the 17th of October, 1850, Hassan Khan, one of the khowas, or pages, whose special duty
it is to deliver all papers to the King, fell under his Majesty's displeasure, and his house
was seized and searched. Several of the Resident's official notes were found unopened among
his papers. They had been sent to the palace as emergent many months before, but never shown
to the King. Such official notes from the Resident are hardly every shown to the King, nor
is he consulted about the orders to be passed upon them.]

They share largely in all that he gets; and take a great deal, for which they render him no
account. Knowing all that he takes, and ought not to take, he dares not punish them for their
transgressions; and knowing this, sufferers are afraid to complain against them. In ordinary
times, or under ordinary sovereigns, the sums paid by revenue authorities in nazuranas, or
gratuities, before they were permitted to enter on their charges, amounted to, perhaps, ten
or fifteen per cent.: under the present sovereign they amount, I believe, to more than twenty-five
per cent. upon the revenue they are to collect. Of these the minister and his deputies take
the largest part. A portion is paid in advance, and good bonds are taken for the rest, to be
paid within the year. Of the money collected, more than twenty-five per cent., on an average,
is appropriated by those intrusted with the disbursements, and by their patrons and patronesses.
The sovereign gets, perhaps, three-fourths of what is collected; and of what is collected,
perhaps two-thirds, on an average, reaches its legitimate destination; so that one-half of
the revenues of Oude may be considered as taken by officers and Court favourites in unauthorized
gratuities and perquisites. The pay of the troops and establishments, on duty with the revenue
collectors, is deducted by them, and the surplus only is sent to the Treasury at Lucknow. In
his accounts he receives credit for all sums paid to the troops and establishments on duty
under him. Though the artillery-bullocks get none of the grain, for which he pays and charges
Government, a greater portion of the whole of what he pays and charges in his accounts reaches
its legitimate destination, perhaps, than of the whole of what is paid from the Treasury at
the capital. On an average, however, I do not think that more than two- thirds of what is paid
and charged to Government reaches that destination.

I may instance the two regiments, under Thakur Sing, Tirbaydee; which are always on duty at
the palace. It is known that the officers and sipahees of those regiments do not get more than
one-half of the pay which is issued for them every month from the Treasury; the other half
is absorbed by the commandant and his patrons at Court. On everything sold in the palace, the
vender is obliged to add one-third to the price, to be paid to the person through whom it is
passed in. Without this, nothing can be sold in the palace by European or native. Not a single
animal in the King's establishments gets one- third of the food allowed for it, and charged
for; not a building is erected or repaired at less than three times the actual outlay, two-
thirds at least of the money charged going to the superintendent and his patrons.

December 23, 1849.--Halted at Sultanpoor, which is one of the healthiest stations in India,
on the right bank of the Goomtee river, upon a dry soil, among deep ravines, which drain off
the water rapidly. The bungalows are on the verge, looking down into the river, upon the level
patches of land, dividing the ravines. The water in the wells is some fifty feet below the
surface, on a level with the stream below. There are no groves within a mile of the cantonments;
and no lakes, marshes, or jungles within a great many; and the single trees in and near the
cantonments are few. The gardens are small and few; and the water is sparingly used in irrigating
them, as the expense of drawing it is very great.

There is another good site for a cantonment at Chandour, some twelve miles up the river, on
the opposite bank, and looking down upon the stream, from the verge, in the same manner. Chandour
was chosen for his cantonments by Rajah Dursun Sing when he had the contract for the district;
and it would be the best place for the head-quarters of any establishments, that any new arrangements
might require for the administration of the Sultanpoor and surrounding districts. Secrora would
be the best position for the head-quarters of those required for the administration of the
Gonda-Bahraetch, and other surrounding districts. It is central, and has always been considered
one of the healthiest places in Oude. It was long a cantonment for one of our regiments of
infantry and some guns, which were, in 1835, withdrawn, and sent to increase the force at Lucknow,
from two to three regiments of infantry. The regiment and guns at Sultanpoor were taken away
in 1837. Secrora was, for some years after our regiment and guns had been withdrawn, occupied
by a regiment and guns under Captain Barlow, one of the King of Oude's officers; but it is
now altogether deserted. Sultanpoor has been, ever since 1837, occupied by one of the two regiments
of Oude local Infantry, without any guns or cavalry of any kind. There was also a regiment
of our regular infantry at Pertabghur, three marches from Sultanpoor, on the road to Allahabad,
with a regiment of our light cavalry. The latter was withdrawn in 1815 for the Nepaul war,
and employed again under us during the Mahratta war in 1817 and 1818. It was sent back again
in 1820; but soon after, in 1821, withdrawn altogether, and we have since had no cavalry of
any kind in Oude. Seetapoor was also occupied by one of our regular regiments of infantry and
some guns till 1837, when they were withdrawn, and their place supplied by the second regiment
of Oude Local Infantry. Two engagements are as Russoolabad had been protected to apologize of estate,

Volume.
 The guns are six 6-pounders, drawn by bullocks; and two gallopers
of very small calibre, drawn by horses. They are not adapted for the duties they have to perform,
which is chiefly against mud-forts and strongholds; and four 9- pounders, two howitzers, and
two mortars would be better. They are, however, well manned and provided with bullocks, ammunition
and stores. The finest young men in Oude are glad to take service under Captain Magness; and
the standard height of his men is at present five feet ten inches. He has some few men, good
for nothing, called sufarishies, whom he is obliged to keep in on account of the persons by
whom they are recommended, eunuchs, fiddlers, and Court favourites, of all kinds. In no country
are there a body of finer looking recruits than Captain Magness now has at drill. All of the
first families in the country, and of unquestionable courage and fidelity to their salt. He
has four hundred Cavalry, of what is called the body guard, men well dressed, and of fine appearance.
These Cavalry are, however, likely soon to be taken from him, and made over to some good-for-nothing
Court favourite.* He has about seven hundred men present with his Infantry corps. His adjutant,
Yosuf Khan, speaks English well, and has travelled a good deal in England, Europe generally,
and Palestine. He is a sensible, unprejudiced man, and good soldier. Captain Magness attends
the Nazim of the district; but, unfortunately, like all the commandants of corps and public
servants of the State, he is obliged to forage for fodder and fuel. A foraging party is sent
out every day, be where they will, to take these things gratis, wherever they can find them
most conveniently. Bhoosa, grass and wood are the things which they are authorized to take,
without payment, wherever they can find them; but they, of course, take a good many other things.
The Government allows nothing to any of its troops or establishments, for these things, except
when they are in Lucknow. The consequence is, that there is hardly a good cover to any man's
house, or sufficient fodder for the cattle of any village, during the hot season and rains.

[* They were soon after taken from Captain Magness and given to Mr. Johannes; and soon after
taken from him, and made over to an eunuch, who turned out all the good men, to sell their
places to men good for nothing. They mutinied; but the King and minister supported the eunuch,
and the greater part of the men were discharged and their officers ruined.]

December 27, 1849--Halted at Pertabghur. I had a visit from many of the persons who were in
my service, when I was here with my regiment thirty years ago, as watchmen, gardeners, &c.
They continue to hold and till the lands, which they or their fathers then tilled; and the
change in them is not so great as that which has taken place within the same time among my
old native friends, who survive in the Saugor and Nerbudda districts, where the air is less
dry, and the climate less congenial to the human frame. The natives say that the air and water
of Malwa may produce as good trees and crops as those of Oude, but can never produce such good
soldiers. This, I believe, is quite true. The Sultanpoor district is included in the Banoda
division of Oude; and the people speak of the water of this division for tempering soldiers,
as we talk of the water of Damascus, for tempering sword blades. They certainly never seem
so happy as when they are fighting in earnest with swords, spears, and matchlocks. The water
of the Byswara division is considered to be very little inferior to that of Banoda, and we
get our sipahees from these two divisions almost exclusively.

Captain Magness's corps is, at present, attached to the Nazim of this district, with its guns,
and squadron of horse, as an auxiliary force. Over and above this force, he has nine regiments
of Nujeebs, detachments of other Corps, Artillery, Pioneers, &c., amounting, in all, according
to the musters and pay-drafts, to seven thousand seven hundred and seventy-eight men, for whom
thirty-seven thousand seven hundred and ninety-three rupees a-month are drawn. Of these, fifteen
hundred are dead or have deserted, or are absent on leave without pay. Their pay is all appropriated
by the commandants of corps or Court favourites. Fifteen hundred more are in attendance on
the commandants of corps, who reside at the capital, and their friends or other influential
persons about the Court, or engaged in their own trades or affairs, having been put into the
corps by influential persons at Court, to draw pay, but do no duty. Of the remaining four thousand
seven hundred and seventy-eight, one-third, or one thousand five hundred and ninety-two, are
what is called sufarishies, or men who are unfit for duty, and have been put in by influential
persons at Court, to appear at muster and draw pay. Of the remaining three thousand one hundred
and eighty-six present, there would be no chance of getting more than two-thirds, or two thousand
one hundred and twenty-four men to fight on emergency--indeed, the Nazim would think himself
exceedingly lucky if he could get one-third to do so.

Of the forty-two guns, thirteen are utterly useless on the ground; and out of the remaining
twenty-nine, there are draft bullocks for only five. But there are no stores or ammunition
for any of them; and the Nazim is obliged to purchase what powder and ball he may require in
the bazaars. None of the gun-carriages have been repaired for the last twenty years, and the
strongest of them would go to pieces after a few rounds. Very few of them would stand one round
with good powder. Five hundred rupees are allowed for fitting up the carriage and tumbril of
each gun, after certain intervals of from five to ten years; and this sum has, no doubt, been
drawn over and over for these guns, during the twenty years, within which they have had no
repairs whatever. If the local governor is permitted to draw this sum, he is sure never to
expend one farthing of it on the gun. If the person in charge of the ordnance at Lucknow draws
it, the guns and tumbrils are sent in to him, and returned with, at least, a coating of paint
and putty, but seldom with anything else. The two persons in charge of the two large parks
at Lucknow, from which the guns are furnished, Anjum-od Dowlah, and Ances-od Dowlah, a fiddler,
draw the money for the corn allowed for the draft bullocks, at the rate of three pounds per
diem for each, and distribute, or pretend to distribute it through the agents of the grain-dealers,
with whom they contract for the supply; and the district officers, under whom these draft bullocks
are employed, are never permitted to interfere. They have nothing to do but pay for the grain
allowed; and the agents, employed to feed the bullocks, do nothing but appropriate the money
for themselves and their employers. Not a grain of corn do the bullocks ever get.

The Nazim has charge of the districts of Sultanpoor, Haldeemow, Pertabghur, Jugdeespoor, and
that part of Fyzabad which is not included in the estate of Bukhtawar Sing, yielding, altogether,

At the end of that time, two sipahees came, in the month of February, 1849, from the town of
Singramow, which is ten miles from Chupra, on the bank of the Khobae rivulet. While they sat
on the border of the jungle, which extended down to the stream, watching for hogs, which commonly
come down to drink at that time in the morning, they saw there three wolf cubs and a boy come
out from the jungle, and go down together to the stream to drink. The sipahees watched them
till they had drank, and were about to return, when they rushed towards them. All four ran
towards a den in the ravines. The sipahees followed as fast as they could; but the three cubs
had got in before the sipahees could come up with them, and the boy was half way in when one
of the sipahees caught him by the hind leg, and drew him back. He seemed very angry and ferocious,
bit at them, and seized in his teeth the barrel of one of their guns, which they put forward
to keep him off, and shook it. They however secured him, brought him home, and kept him for
twenty days. They could for that time make him eat nothing but raw flesh, and they fed him
upon hares and birds. They found it difficult to provide him with sufficient food, and took
him to the bazaar in the village of Koeleepoor; and there let him go to be fed by the charitable
people of the place till he might be recognised and claimed by his parents. One market-day
a man from the village of Chupra happened to see him in the bazaar, and on his return mentioned
the circumstance to his neighbours. The poor cultivator's widow, on hearing this, asked him
to describe the boy more minutely, when she found that the boy had the mark of a scald on the
left knee, and three marks of the teeth of an animal on each side of his loins. The widow told
him that her boy when taken off had lately recovered from a scald on the left knee, and was
seized by the loins when the wolf took him off, and that the boy he had seen must be her lost
child.

She went off forthwith to the Koelee bazaar, and, in addition to the two marks above described,
discovered a third mark on his thigh, with which her child was born. She took him home to her
village, where he was recognised by all her neighbours. She kept him for two months, and all
the sporting landholders in the neighbourhood sent her game for him to feed upon. He continued
to dip his face in the water to drink, but he sucked in the water, and did not lap it up like
a dog or wolf. His body continued to smell offensively. When the mother went to her work, the
boy always ran into the jungle, and she could never get him to speak. He followed his mother
for what he could get to eat, but showed no particular affection for her; and she could never
bring herself to feel much for him; and after two months, finding him of no use to her, and
despairing of even making anything of him, she left him to the common charity of the village.
He soon after learnt to eat bread when it was given him, and ate whatever else he could get
during the day, but always went off to the jungle at night. He used to mutter something, but
could never be got to articulate any word distinctly. The front of his knees and elbows had
become hardened from going on all fours with the wolves. If any clothes are put on him, he
takes them off, and commonly tears them to pieces in doing so. He still prefers raw flesh to
cooked, and feeds on carrion whenever he can get it. The boys of the village are in the habit
of amusing themselves by catching frogs and throwing them to him; and he catches and eats them.
When a bullock dies, and the skin is removed, he goes and eats it like a village dog. The boy
is still in the village, and this is the description given of him by the mother herself, who
still lives at Chupra. She has never experienced any return of affection for him, nor has he
shown any such feeling for her. Her story is confirmed by all her neighbours, and by the head
landholders, cultivators, and shopkeepers of the village.*

[* In November, 1850, Captain Nicholetts, on leaving the cantonments of Sultanpoor, where he
commanded, ordered this boy to be sent in to me with his mother, but he got alarmed on the
way and ran to a jungle. He will no doubt find his way back soon if he lives.]

The Rajah of Hasunpoor Bundooa mentions, as a fact within his own knowledge, besides the others,
for the truth of which he vouches, that, in the year 1843, a lad came to the town of Hasunpoor,
who had evidently been brought up by wolves. He seemed to be twelve years of age when he saw
him--was very dark, and ate flesh, whether cooked or uncooked. He had short hair all over his
body when he first came, but having, for a time, as the Rajah states, eaten salt with his food,
like other human beings, the hair by degrees disappeared. He could walk, like other men, on
his legs, but could never be taught to speak. He would utter sounds like wild animals, and
could be made to understand signs very well. He used to sit at a bunneea's shop in the bazaar,
but was at last recognised by his parents, and taken off. What became of him afterwards he
knows not. The Rajah's statement regarding this lad is confirmed by all the people of the town,
but none of them know what afterwards became of him.

 In Rajpootana and Sinde no prevailing wind, I believe, comes
from any sea nearer than the Atlantic ocean; and there are but few trees to attract to the
earth the little moisture that the atmosphere contains. The rain that falls over these countries
is not, I believe, equal to more than one-third of what falls over the districts, supplied
from the Bay of Bengal, or to one-fourth of what falls in those supplied from the Gulf of Cambay.
Our own districts of the N. W. Provinces, which intervene between those north of the Ganges
and Rajpootana, have the advantage of rivers and canals; but their atmosphere is not so well
supplied with moisture from the sea, nor are they so well studded as they ought to be with
trees. The Punjab has still greater advantages from numerous rivers, flowing from the Himmalaya
chain, and is, like Egypt, in some measure independent of moisture from the atmosphere as far
as tillage is concerned; but both would, no doubt, be benefited by a greater abundance of trees.
They not only tend to convey to and retain moisture in the soil, and to purify the air for
man, by giving out oxygen and absorbing carbonic acid gas, but they are fertilizing media,
through which the atmosphere conveys to the soil most of the carbon, and much of the ammonia,
without which no soil can be fertile. It is, I believe, generally admitted that trees derive
most of their carbon from the air through their leaves, and most of their ammonia from the
soil through their roots; and that when the trees, shrubs, and plants, which form our coal-measures,
adorned the surface of the globe, the atmosphere must have contained a greater portion of carbonic
acid gas than at present. They decompose the gases, use the carbon, and give back the oxygen
to the atmosphere.

December 30, 1849.--Ten miles to Salone, over a pretty country, well studded with fine trees
and well tilled, except in large patches of oosur land, which occur on both sides of the road.
The soil, doomuteea, with a few short intervals of muteear. The Rajah of Pertabghur, and other
great landholders of the Sultanpoor division, who had been for some days travelling with me,
and the Nazim and his officers, took leave yesterday. The Nazim, Aga Allee, is a man of great
experience in the convenances of court and city life, and of some in revenue management, having
long had charge of the estates comprised in the "Hozoor Tehseel," while he resided at Lucknow.
He has good sense and an excellent temper, and his manners and deportment are courteous and
gentlemanly. The Rajah of Pertabghur is a very stout and fat man, of average understanding.
The rightful heir to the principality was Seorutun Sing, whom I have mentioned in my Rambles
and Recollections, as a gallant young landholder, fighting for his right to the succession,
while I was cantoned at Pertabghur in 1818. He continued to fight, but in vain, as the revenue
contractors were too strong for him. Gholam Hoseyn, the then Nazim, kept him down while he
lived, and Dursun Sing got him into his power by fraud, and confined him for three years in gaol.

He died soon after his release, leaving one son. Rajah Dheer Sing,* who still lives upon the
portion of land which his father inherited. He has taken up the contest for the right bequeathed
to him by his father; and his uncle, Golab Sing, the younger brother of Seorutun, a brave,
shrewd, and energetic man, has been for some days importuning me for assistance. The nearest
relations of the family told me yesterday, that they were coerced by the Government authorities
into recognising the adoption of the present Rajah, though it was contrary to all Hindoo law
and usage. Hindoos, they said, never marry into the same gote or family, and they never ought
to adopt one of the relations of their wives, or a son of a sister, or any descendant in the
female line, while there is one of the male line existing. Seoruttun Sing was the next heir
in the male line; but the Rajah, having married a young girl in his old age, adopted as his
heir to the principality her nearest relative, the present Rajah, who is of a different gote.
The desire to keep the land in the same family has given rise to singular laws and usages in
all nations in the early stages of civilization, when industry is confined almost exclusively
to agriculture, and land is almost the only property valued. Among the people of the Himmalaya
hills, as in all Sogdiana, it gave rise to polyandry; and, among the Israelites and Mahommedans,
to the marriage of many brothers in succession to the same woman.

[* Rajah Deer Sing died in April 1851, leaving a very young son under the guardianship of his
uncle, Golab Sing.]

The Rajah of Dharoopoor, who resides at Rampoor, our last halting- place, holds, as above stated,
a tract of land along the left bank of the Ganges, called the Kalakunkur, in which he has lately
built a mud-fort of reputed strength. He is a very sensible and active man of pleasing manners.
He has two grown-up sons, who were introduced to me by him yesterday. The Government authorities
complain of his want of punctuality in the payment of his revenue; and he complains, with much
more justice, of the uncertainty in the rate of the demand on the part of Government and its
officers or Court favourites, and in the character of the viceroys sent to rule over them;
but, above all, of the impossibility of getting a hearing at Court when they are wronged and
oppressed by bad viceroys. He went twice himself to Lucknow, to complain of grievous wrongs
suffered by him and his tenants from an oppressive viceroy; but, though he had some good friends
at Court, and among them Rajah Bukhtawar Sing, he was obliged to return without finding access
to the sovereign or his minister, or any one in authority over the viceroy. He told me that
all large landholders, who had any regard for their character, or desire to retain their estates,
and protect their tenants, were obliged to arm and take to their strongholds or jungles as
their only resource, when bad viceroys were sent--that if they could be assured that fair demands
only would be made, and that they would have access to authority, when they required to defend
themselves from false charges, and to complain of the wrong doings of viceroys and their agents,
none of them would be found in resistance against the Government, since all were anxious to
bequeath to their children a good name, as well as a good estate. He promised punctual payment
of his revenues to Government, and strict obedience in all things, provided that the contractor
did not enhance his demand upon him, as he now seemed disposed to do, in the shape of gratuities
to himself and Court favourites. "To be safe in Oude" he said, "it is necessary to be strong,
and prepared always to use your strength in resisting outrage and oppression, on the part of
the King's officers."

At Salone resides a holy Mahommedan, Shah Puna Ata, who is looked up to with great reverence
by both Mahommedans and Hindoos, for the sanctity of his character, and that of his ancestors,
who sat upon the same religions throne, for throne his simple mattress is considered to be.
From the time that the heir is called to the throne, he never leaves his house, but stays at
home to receive homage, and distribute blessings and food to needy travellers of all religions.
He gets from the King of Oude twelve villages, rent free, in perpetuity; and they are said
to yield him twenty-five thousand rupees a-year, with which he provides for his family, and
for needy travellers and pilgrims. This eleemosynary endowment was granted, about sixty years
ago, by the then sovereign, Asuf-od Dowlah. The lands had belonged to a family of Kumpureea
Rajpoots, who were ousted for contumacy or rebellion, I believe. He was plundered of all he
had, to the amount of some twenty thousand rupees, in 1834, during the reign of Nuseer-on Deen
Hyder, by Ehsan Hoseyn, the Nazim of Byswara and Salone, one of the sons of Sobhan Allee Khan,
the then virtual minister; but some fifteen days after, he attacked the tallookdar of Bhuderee,
and lost his place in consequence. The popular belief is, that he became insane in consequence
of the holy man's curses, and that his whole family became ruined from the same cause.

Bhuderee, which lies a few miles to the south of Salone, was then held by two gallant Rajpoot
brothers, Jugmohun Sing and Bishonath Sing, the sons of Zalim Sing. In the month of October,
A.D. 1832, Dhokul Sing got the contract of the district, and demanded from Bhuderee an increase
of ten thousand rupees in its revenue. They refused to pay this increase. At the established
rate they had always paid the Government demand punctually, and been good subjects and excellent
landlords. Vol, they all such is previously upon road. We state, "them is from mrs, whom was not distrust

I asked Rajah Hunmunt Sing, of Dharoopoor, as he was riding by my side, this morning, whether
he was not a man of bad character. He said, "No, by no means; he is a man of great possessions,
credit, and influence, and of good repute." "But does he not rob smaller proprietors of their
hereditary lands?" "If," replied the Rajah, "you estimate men's character in Oude on this principle,
you will find hardly any landholder of any rank with a good one, for they have all been long
doing the same thing--all have been augmenting their own estates by absorbing those of smaller
proprietors, by what you will call fraud, violence, and collusion, but they are not thought
the worse of for this by the Government or its officers." Nothing could be more true. Men who
augment their estates in this way, purchase the acquiescence of temporary local officers, either
by gratuities, or promises of aid, in putting down other powerful and refractory landholders;
or they purchase the patronage of Court favourites, who get their estates transferred to the
"Hozoor Tehseel," and their transgressions overlooked. Those who augment their resources in
this way, employ them in maintaining armed bands, building forts, and purchasing cannon, to
secure themselves in the possession, and to resist the Government and its officers, who might
otherwise make them pay in some proportion to their usurpations.

Benee Madho called upon me after breakfast, and gave me the little of his history that I desired
to hear. He is of the Byans Rajpoot clan, and his ancestors have been settled in Oude for about
twenty-five generations, as landholders of different grades. The tallook or estate now belongs
to him, and is considered to be a principality, to descend entire by the law of primogeniture,
to the nearest male heir, unless the lands become divided during his life-time among his sons.
Such a division has already taken place, as will be seen by the annexed note :*

[* Abdool-Sing, the tallookdar of Shunkurpoor, had three sons; first, Doorga Buksh, to whom
he gave three shares; second, Chundha Buksh, to whom he gave two shares; third, Bhowanee Buksh,
to whom he gave one and half share. The three shares of Doorga Buksh descended to his son,
Sheopersaud, who died without issue. Chunda Buksh left two sons, Ramnaraen and Gor Buksh, Ramnaraen
inherited the three shares of Sheopersaud, as well as the two shares of his father. He had
three sons, Rana Benee Madho, Nirput Sing, and Jogray Sing; Benee Madho inherited the three
shares, and one of the other two was given to Nirput Sing, and the other to Jogray Sing. Gorbuksh
Sing left one son, Sheopersaud, who gets the one and half share of Bhowanee Buksh, whose son,
Joorawun, died without issue. Benee Madho is now the head of the family; and he has more than
quadrupled his three shares by absorptions, made in the way above mentioned.]

The three and half shares held by his brothers and cousins are liable to subdivision by the
Hindoo law of inheritance, or the custom of his family and clan; but his own share must descend
undivided, unless he divides it during his lifetime, or his heirs divide it during theirs,
and consent to descend in the scale of landholders. He says that, during the five years that
Fakeer Mahommed Khan was Nazim, a quarrel subsisted between him and the tallookdar of Khujoor
Gow, Rugonath Sing, his neighbour; that Sahib Rae, the deputy of Fakeer Mahommed, who was himself
no man of business, adopted the cause of his enemy, and persuaded his master to attack and
rob him of all he had, turn him out of his estate, and make it over to Rugonath Sing. He went
to Lucknow for redress, and remained there urging his claims for fourteen months, when he got
an order from the minister, Ameen-od Dowlah, for the estate being restored to him and transferred
to the Hozoor Tehseel. He recovered his possessions, and the transfer was made; and he has
ever since lived in peace. He might have added that he has been, at the same time, diligently
employed in usurping the possessions of his weaker neighbours.*

[* Benee Madho and Rugonath Sing have since quarrelled about the title of Rana. Benee Madho
assumed the title, and Rugonath wished to do the same, but Benee Madho thought this would derogate
from his dignity. They had some fighting, but Rugonath at last gave in, and Benee Madho purchased,
from the Court a recognition of his exclusive right to the title, which is a new one in Oude.
They had each a force of five thousand brave men, besides numerous auxiliaries.]

On our road, two miles from Rae Bareilly, we passed over a bridge on the Saee river, built
by Reotee Ram, the deputy of the celebrated eunuch, Almas Allee Khan, some sixty or seventy
years ago. He at the same time planted an avenue of fine trees from Salone to Rae Bareilly,
twenty miles; and from Rae Bareilly to Dalamow, on the Ganges, south, a distance of fourteen
miles more. Many of the trees are still standing and very fine; but the greater part have been
cut down during the contests that have taken place between the Government officers and the
landholders, or between the landholders themselves. The troops in attendance upon local government
authorities have, perhaps, been the greatest enemies to this avenue, for they spare nothing
of value, either in exchange or esteem, that they have the power to take. The Government and
its officers feel no interest in such things, and the family of the planter has no longer the
means to protect the trees or repair the works.

Rae Bareilly is the head-quarters of the local authorities in the Byswara district, and is
considered to be one of the most healthy places in Oude. It is near the bank of the small river
Saee, in a fine, open plain of light soil, and must be dry at all seasons, as the drainage
is good; and there are no jheels or jungles near. It would be an excellent cantonment for a
large force, and position for large civil establishments. The town is a melancholy ruin, and
the people tell me that whatever landholder in the district quarrels with the local authorities
is sure, as his first enterprise, to sack Rae Bareilly, as there is no danger in doing it.
The inhabitants live so far from each other, and are separated by such heaps of ruins and deep
water-courses, that they can make no resistance. The high walls and buildings, all of burnt
brick, erected in the time of Shahjehan, are all gone to ruin. The plain, around the town,
is open, level, well cultivated, and beautifully studded with trees. There is a fine tank of
puckah masonry to the north-west of the town, built by the same Reotee Ram, and repaired by
some member of his family, who holds and keeps in good order the pretty garden around it. The
best place for a cantonment, courts, &c., is the plain which separates the town from the river
Saee to the south-east: they should extend along from the town to the bridge over the Saee
river. The water of this river is said to be excellent, though not quite equal to that of the
Ganges. There is good water in most of the wells, but in some it is said to be brackish. The
bridge requires repair.

January 2, 1850.--We halted at Rae Bareilly, and I inspected the bullocks belonging to the
guns of Sobha Sing's regiment and some guns belonging to the Nazim. The bullocks have been
starved, are hardly able to walk, and quite unfit for any work. Some of the carriages of the
guns are broken down, and those that are still entire are so rotten that they could not bear
a march. This regiment of Sobha Sing's was as good as any of those commanded by Captains Magness,
Bunbury, and Barlow, while commanded by the late Captain Buckley;* and the native officers
and sipahees trained under him are all still excellent, but they are not well provided. Fodder will be
legends should be doubted; and them is for captain had, who made it am on fields have cut

Gorbuksh Sing, Synbunsee, died some twenty years ago, leaving an estate, reduced from a greater
number to ninety-three villages. His nephew, Futteh Bahader, a child, was adopted by his widow,
who continued to manage the whole till she died, four years after. The heir was still a boy;
and Rugonath Sing, of Kojurgow, the head of the Synbunsee family, took advantage of his youth,
seized upon the whole ninety-three villages, and turned him out to beg subsistence among his
relatives. In this he, Rugonath Sing, was, as usual, acting in collusion with the local authorities
of the Government. He continued to possess the estate for ten years, but to reside in his fort
of Hajeepoor. Koelee Sing, a Guhlote, by caste, and a zumeendar of Bheeturgow, and its eight
dependent villages, which formed part of the estate of Futteh Bahader, went to Court at Lucknow,
and represented, that Rugonath Sing had no right whatever to the lands he held, and the Court
had better make them over to him and the other zumeendars, if they did not like to restore
them to their rightful heir. Bheeturgow and its dependent eight villages, were made over to
him; and ten sipahees, from Captain Hyder Hearsey's Regiment, were sent to establish and support
him in possession. Rugonath attacked them, killed two of the sipahees, and drove out Koelee
Sing. He repaired to Court; and Mahomed Khan was sent out, as Special Commissioner, with orders
to punish Rugonath Sing. He and Captain Hearsey attacked him in his fort of Hajeepoor, drove
him out, and restored Futteh Bahader, to twenty-four villages; and re-established Koelee Sing,
in Bheeturgow, and the eight villages dependent upon it. Futteh Bahader was poor, and was obliged
to tender the security of Benee Madho, the wealthy tallookdar of this place, for the punctual
payment of the revenue. The year before last, when a balance of revenue became due, he, the
deputy, in collusion with Gholam Allee, seized upon all the twenty-four villages.

Futteh Bahader went to seek redress at Lucknow, but had no money to pay his way at Court, while
Benee Madho had abundance, and used it freely, to secure the possession of so fine an addition
to his estate. Futteh Bahader, as his last resource, got his uncle, Bustee Sing, of the 3rd
Cavalry, whom he called his father,* to present a petition for redress to the Resident, in
April 1849. Gholam Allee was ordered to release Futteh Bahader, whom Benee Madho had confined,
and send him to Lucknow. The order was not obeyed, and it was repeated in December without
effect; but his uncle's agent, Gorbuksh, was diligent at the Residency, and the case was made
over for investigation and decision to the Ameen, Mahomed Hyat. Finding Futteh Bahader still
in confinement, with sundry members of his family, when I came here yesterday, I ordered him
to be made over to the King's wakeel, in attendance upon me, to be sent to the Court, to prosecute
his claim, and produce proofs of his right. Of his right there can be no question, and the
property of which he was robbed, in taking possession, and the rents since received, if duly
accounted for, would more than cover any balance due by Futteh Bahader. When he gave the security
of Benee Madho, for the payment of the revenue, he gave, at the same time, what is called the
Jumog of his villages to him; that is, bound his tenants to pay to him their rents at the rate
they were pledged to pay to him; and the question pending is, simply, what is fairly due to
Benee Madho, over and above what he may have collected from them. Benee Madho had before, by
the usual process of violence, fraud, and collusion, taken eighteen of the ninety-three villages,
and got one for a servant; and all the rest had, by the same process, got into the possession
of others; and Futteh Bahader had not an acre left when his uncle interposed his good offices
with the Resident.** The dogs of the village of Doolarae-kee Gurhee followed us towards camp,
and were troublesome to the horses and my elephant. I asked the principal zumeendar why they
were kept. He said they amused the children of the village, who took them out after the hares,
and by their aid and that of the sticks with which they armed themselves, they got a good many;
that all they got for food was the last mouthful of every man's dinner, which no man was sordid
enough to grudge them--that when they wished to describe a very sordid man, they said--"he
would not even throw his last mouthful (koura) to a dog!"

[* He called Bustee Sing his father, as sipahees can seek redress through the Resident, for
wrongs suffered by no others than their mothers, fathers, their children, and themselves.]

[** A punchaet was assembled at Lucknow, to decide the suit between Benee Madho and Futteh
Bahader, at the instance of the Resident: and they awarded to Benee Madho a balance due on
account of thirty thousand rupees, which Futteh Bahader has to pay before he can recover possession
of his estate.]

January 5, 1851.--Halted at Onae, in consequence of continued rain, which incommodes us, but
delights the landholders and cultivators, whose crops will greatly benefit by it. The halting
of so large a camp inconveniences them, however, much more than us; for they are called upon
to supply us with wood, grass, and straw, for which they receive little or no payment; for
the Kings people will not let us pay for these things, and pay too little themselves. Those
who attend us do not plunder along the road; but the followers of the local authorities, who
attend us, through their respective jurisdictions, do so; and sundry fields of fine carrots
and other vegetables disappear, as under a flight of locusts along the road. The camp- followers
assist them, and as our train extends from the ground we leave to that to which we are going,
for twelve or fourteen miles, it is impossible, altogether, to prevent such injuries from so
undisciplined a band. The people, however, say, they suffer much less than they would from
one-fourth of the number under a contractor marching without an European superior, and I give
compensation in flagrant cases. Captain Weston acts as our Provost Marshal. He leaves the ground
an hour or two after I do, and seizes and severely punishes any one found trespassing.

In my ride this morning I found that Nyhussa and Synbunsee are two villages distant about ten
miles from our camp, to the south-east-- that all the Byses, who give the name of Byswara to
this large district, are called Tilokchundees, from Tilokchund, the founder of the family in
Oude. He had two sons, Hurhur Deo and Prethee Chund. Hurhur Deo had two sons, one of whom,
Kurun Rae, established himself in Nyhussa, and the other, Khem Kurun, in Synbunsee. Their descendants
have taken their titles from their respective villages. Prethee Chund's descendants established
themselves in other parts, and the descendants of both bear the appellation of Tilokchundee
Byses. The Rajahs and Rows are of the same family, and are so called from their ancestors having,
at some time, had the title of Rajah and Row conferred upon them.

 It is, they say, a reprehensible departure from the spirit of their
creed, and from the simple tastes of the early Mahommedans, who laid out their superfluities
in the construction of great and durable works of ornament and utility. Certainly no event
can be more sorrowful among Mahommedans than that which is commemorated in the mohurrum by
illuminations and processions with the Tazeeas; and yet no illuminations are more brilliant,
and no processions more noisy, costly, and splendid. It is worthy of remark, that Hindoo princes
in Central and Southern India, even of the Brahmin caste, commemorate this event in the same
way; and in no part of India are these illuminations and processions more brilliant and costly.
Their object is solely to amuse the population of their capitals, and to gratify the Mahommedan
women whom they have under their protection, and their children, who must all be Mahommedans.

January 8, 1850.--Nawabgunge, eleven miles over a plain, the soil of which, near the road,
is generally very poor oosur. No fruit or ornamental trees, few shrubs, and very little grass.
Here and there, however, even near the road, may be seen a small patch of land, from which
a crop of rice has been taken this season; and the country is well cultivated all along, up
to within half a mile of the road, on both tides [sides]. Nawabgunge is situated on the new
metalled road, fifty miles long, between Lucknow and Cawnpoor, and about midway between the
two places.* It was built by the late minister, Nawab Ameen-od Dowlah, while in office, for
the accommodation of travellers, and is named after him. It is kept up at his expense for the
same purpose now that he has descended to private life. There is a small house for the accommodation
of European gentlemen and ladies, as well as a double range of buildings, between which the
road passes, for ordinary travellers, and for shopkeepers to supply them.

[* The term Gunge, signifies a range of buildings at a place of traffic, for the accommodation
of merchants, and all persons engaged in the purchase and sale of goods and for that of their
goods and of the shopkeepers who supply them.]

Some people told me, that even the worst of this oosur soil might be made to produce fair crops
under good tillage; while others denied the possibility, though all were farmers or landholders.
All, however, agreed that any but the worst might be made so by good tillage--that is, by flooding
the land by means of artificial embankments, for two or three rainy seasons, and then cross-
ploughing, manuring, and irrigating it well. All say that the soil hereabouts is liable to
become oosur, if left fallow and neglected for a few years. The oosur, certainly, seems to
prevail most near the high roads, where the peasantry have been most exposed to the rapacity
of the King's troops; and this tends to confirm the notion that tillage is necessary in certain
soils to check the tendency of the carbonates or nitrates, or their alkaline bases, to superabundance.
The abundance of the chloride of sodium in the soil, from which the superabounding carbonates
of soda are formed, seems to indicate, unequivocally, that the bed from which they are brought
to the surface by capillary attraction must at some time have been covered by salt water.

Government will not do away with the privilege without first ascertaining the views and wishes
of the military authorities. They are not favourable to the abolition, for though the honest
and hard- working sipahees may say that it is of no use to them, the idle and unscrupulous,
who consider it as a lottery in which they may sometimes draw a prize, or a means of getting
leave of absence when they are not entitled to it, will tell them that the fidelity of the
whole native army depends upon its being maintained and extended. I am of opinion, after much
consideration, and a good deal of experience in the political working of the system, that the
abolition of the privilege would be of great advantage to the native army; and it would certainly
relieve the European officers from much importunity and annoyance which they now suffer from
its enforcement. It is not uncommon for a sipahee of a regiment in Bombay to obtain leave of
absence for several times over for ten months at a time, on the pretence of having a case pending
in Oude. When his leave is about to expire, he presents a petition to the Resident, who obtains
for him from the Court an order for the local authorities to settle his claim. This order is
sent to the officer commanding his regiment. The man then makes up a piteous story of his having
spent the whole ten months in prosecuting his claim in vain, when, in reality, he has been
enjoying himself at home, and had no claim whatever to settle. The next year, or the year after,
he gets another ten months' leave, for the same purpose, and when it is about to expire, he
presents himself to the Resident, and declares that the local authorities have been changed,
and the new officers pay no regard to the King's orders. New orders are then got for the new
officers, and sent to his regiment, and the same game is played over again.

Native officers and sipahees, in the privilege of presenting petitions through the Resident,
are now restricted to their own claims and those of their wives, fathers, mothers, sons, and
daughters. They cannot petition through the Resident for the redress of wrongs suffered, or
pretended to have been suffered, by any other relations. In consequence, it has become a common
custom with them to lend or sell their names to more remote relations, or to persons not related
to them at all. The petition is made out in their own name, and the real sufferer or pretended
sufferer, who is to prosecute the claim, is named as the mookteear or attorney. A great many
bad characters have in this way deprived men of lands which their ancestors had held in undisputed
right of property for many generations or centuries; for the Court, to save themselves from
the importunity of the Residency, has often given orders for the claimant being put in possession
of the lands without due inquiry or any inquiry at all. The sipahees are, in consequence, much
dreaded by the people among whom they reside; for there really is no class of men from whom
it is more difficult to get the truth in any case. They have no fear of punishment, because
all charges against them for fraud, falsehood, or violation of the rules laid down by Government
have to be submitted either to a court-martial, composed of native officers, or to the Governor-General.
Both involve endless trouble, and it would, I fear, be impossible to get a conviction before
a court-martial so composed. No Resident will ever submit to a Governor-General the scores
of flagrant cases that every month come before him; still less will he worry unoffending and
suffering people by causing them to be summoned to give evidence before a military court.

In a recent instance (July 1851), a sipahee in a regiment stationed at Lucknow was charged
before a court-martial with three abuses of the privilege. He required no less than seventy-four
witnesses to be summoned in his defence. The Court had to wait till what could be got out of
the seventy-four appeared, and the man became an object of sympathy, because he was kept so
long in arrest. He named the first Assistant to the Resident, who has charge of the Sipahee
Petition Department, as a witness; and he was not, in consequence, permitted to attend the
Court on the part of the Resident, who preferred the charges, though he was never called or
examined by the Court on the part of the defence. The naming him, and the summoning of so many
witnesses were mere ruses on the part of the sipahee to escape. No person on the part of the
Resident was allowed to attend the Court and see that his witnesses were examined; nor had
he any means of knowing whether they were or not. He had reason to believe that the most important
were not. The sipahee was of course acquitted, as sipahees charged with such abuses of the
privilege always will be. This man's regiment was at Lucknow, and near the place where the
cause of action arose, his own village, and the Resident's office. How much more difficult
would it be to get a conviction against a sipahee whose regiment happens to be many hundred
miles off!

The transfer of their lands from the jurisdiction of the local authorities to that of the Hozoor
Tehseel is often the cause of much suffering to their copartners and neighbours. Their co-sharers
in the land often find much inconvenience from it, and apprehend that, sooner or later, the
influence of the sipahee will enable him to add their shares to his own. The village so transferred,
being removed from the observation and responsibility of the local authorities, often becomes
a safe refuge for the bad characters of the district, who thence depredate upon the country
around with impunity. Claims to villages, to which the claimant had really no right whatever,
have been successfully prosecuted by or through sipahees, for the sole purpose of having them
transferred to the Hozoor Tehseel, and made dens of thieves and highway robbers. The person
in charge of the Hozool Tehseel villages has generally a good deal of influence at Court, and
this he lends to such claimants, for a consideration, without fear or scruple, as he feels
assured that he shall be able to counteract any representations on the part of the local authorities
of the evils suffered from the holders and occupants of such villages. He never pretends to
be able to watch over or control the conduct of the holders and occupiers of the villages under
his charge, situated, as they mostly are, in remote districts. The transfer of such villages
can be justified only in districts that are held in contract, and even in them it might be
easy to provide effectually for the protection of the holders from over-exactions on the part
of the contractors.

This privilege is attended with infinite difficulty and perplexity to the Resident and Government;
and is at the same time exceedingly odious to the people and Government of Oude. Officers commanding
regiments and companies have much trouble with such petitions. Able to hear only one side of
any question, they think that the evils suffered by the sipahees are much greater and more
numerous than they really are, and grant leave to enable them to prosecute their claims to
redress more often than is necessary. Men who want leave, when they are not otherwise entitled
to it, feign wrongs which they never suffered, or greatly exaggerate such as may really have
been inflicted on them in order to obtain it; or, as I have stated, lend their names to others
and ask leave to prosecute claims with which they have really nothing whatever to do. The sipahees
and native officers of our army are little better with than they would be without the privilege;
and a great many enlist or remain in the service solely with the view of better prosecuting
their claims, and resign or desert as soon as they have effected their purpose, or find that
the privilege is no longer necessary. They make a convenience in this way of our service, and
are the most useless soldiers in our ranks. I am persuaded that we should have from Oude just
as many and as good recruits for our army without as with this privilege.

The regiments of the Gwalior Contingent get just as good recruits from Oude as those of the
Line, though they do not enjoy the privilege. I believe that those corps which did not enjoy
the privilege till within the last two years got just as good recruits from Oude as they now
do, since it has been extended to them. Till 1848 the privilege was limited to the native officers
and soldiers of our regular army, and to such as had been drafted from our regular army into
local corps up to a certain date; but in July of that year the privilege was extended to all
corps, regular and irregular, attached to the Bengal, Madras, and Bombay Presidencies, which
are paid by the British Government. The feelings and opinions of the Oude Government had not
been consulted in the origin of this privilege, nor were they now consulted in the extension
given to it.

Officers commanding regiments and companies complain that the sipahees and native officers
never get redress, whatever trouble they take to obtain it for them; and, I believe, they hardly
ever hear a sipahee or native officer acknowledge that he has had redress. A sipahee one day
came to the first Assistant, Captain Shakespear, clamouring for justice, and declared that
not the slightest notice had been taken of his petition by the Oude Government or its local
authorities. On being questioned, he admitted that no less than forty persons had been seized
and were in prison on his requisition; but he would not admit that this was any proof of the
slightest notice having been taken of his complaint. All are worried, and but few benefited
by the privilege, and the advantage of it to the army never can counterbalance all the disadvantages. Holding

 But to effect all this it would require to transfer at least twenty-five lacs of rupees
a-year from the pockets of official absorbants and Court favourites to those of efficient public
officers; and, finally, to set aside the present King, Minister, and Commander-in-Chief, and
take all the executive upon itself.

The expenditure is now about twenty lacs of rupees a-year above the income, and the excess
is paid out of the reserved treasury. This reserved treasury was first established by Saadut
Allee Khan in A.D. 1801, when he had serious thoughts of resigning the government of his country
into the hands of the Honourable Company, and retiring into private life. Up to this time he
used to drink hard, and to indulge in other pleasures, which tended to unfit him for the cares
and duties of sovereignty; but, in 1801, he made a solemn vow at the shrine of Huzrut Abbas
at Lucknow to cease from all such indulgences, and devote all his time and attention to his
public duties. This vow he kept, and no Sovereign of Oude has ever conducted the Government
with so much ability as he did for the remaining fourteen years of his life. On his death,
which took place on the 12th of July, 1814, he left in this reserved treasury the sum of fourteen
crores of rupees, or fourteen millions sterling, with all his establishments paid up, and his
just debts liquidated. When he ascended the musnud on the 21st January, 1798, he found nothing
in the Treasury, and the public establishments all much in arrears.

Out of this reserved treasure, the zukaat, or two and a-half per cent., is every year paid
to the mojtahid for distribution among the poor of the Sheea sect at Lucknow. No person of
the Sonnee sect is permitted to partake of this charity. Syuds or lineal descendants of the
Prophet are not permitted to take any part of this charity, except for the bonâ fide payment
of debt due. The mojtahid is, at the same time, the high priest and the highest judicial functionary
in the State. Being a Syud, neither he nor any member of his family can legally take any part
of this charity for themselves, except for the bonâ fide purpose of paying debts; but they
get over the difficulty by borrowing large sums before the money is given out, and appropriate
the greater part of the money to the liquidation of these debts, though they all hold large
sums in our Government securities. To his friends at Court he sends a large share, with a request
that they will do him the favour to undertake the distribution among the poor of their neighbourhood.
To prevent popular clamour, a small portion of the money given out is actually distributed
among the poor of the Sheea sect at Lucknow; but that portion is always small.

Saadut Allee's son and successor, Ghazee-od Deen Hyder, spent four crores out of the reserved
treasury over and above the whole income of the State; and when he died, on the 20th of October,
1827, he left ten crores of rupees in that treasury. His son and successor, Nusseer-od Deen
Hyder, spent nine crores and thirty lacs; and when he died, on the 7th of July, 1837, he left
only seventy lacs in the reserved treasury. His successor, Mahommed Allee Shah, died on the
16th of May, 1842, leaving in the reserved treasury thirty-five lacs of rupees, one hundred
and twenty-four thousand gold mohurs, and twenty-four lacs in our Government securities--total,
seventy-eight lacs and eighty-four thousand rupees. His son and successor, his present Majesty,
Wajid Allee Shah, is spending out of this reserved treasury, over and above the whole income
of the country, above twenty lacs of rupees a-year; and the treasury must soon become exhausted.
His public establishments, and the stipendiary members of the royal family, are, at the same
time, kept greatly in arrears.*

[* November 30, 1851.--The gold-mohurs have been all melted down, and the promissory notes
of our Government all, save four lacs, given away; and of the rupees, I believe, only three
lacs remain; so that the reserved treasury must be entirely exhausted before the end of 1851;
while the establishments and stipendiary members of the royal family are in arrears for from
one to three years. Fifty lacs of rupees would hardly suffice to pay off these arrears. The
troops on detached duty, in the provinces with local officers, are not so much in arrears as
those in and about the capital. They are paid out of the revenues as they are collected, and
their receipts sent in to the treasury. For some good or pleasing services rendered by him
to the minister this year, in the trial of offenders whom that minister wished to screen, three
lacs of rupees have been paid to the mojtahid as zukaat for distribution to the poor. My paracelsus,

[* The Sengers are almost the only class of Rajpoots in Bundelkund, and Boghilcund, Rewa, and
the Saugor territories, who used to put their female infants to death; and here, in Oude, they
are almost the only class who do not.]

Rajah Bukhtawar Sing, who was on his horse beside my elephant, said, "They are all punished
in this world, and will, no doubt, be punished still more in the next. Scarcely any of the
heads of these landed aristocracy are the legitimate sons of their predecessors; they are all
adopted, or born of women of inferior grade. The heads of families who commit or tolerate such
atrocities become leprous, blind, deaf or dumb, or are carried off in early life by some terrible
disease. Hardly any of them attain a good old age, nor can they boast of an untainted line
of ancestors like other men. If they get sons, they commonly die young. They unite themselves
to women of inferior castes for want of daughters in families of their own ranks, and there
is hardly a family among these proud Rajpoots unstained by such connections.* Even the reptile
Pausies become Rajpoots by giving their daughters to Powars and other Rajpoot families, when
by robbery and murder they have acquired wealth and landed property. The sister of Gunga Buksh,
of Kasimgunge, was married to the Rajah of Etondeea, a Powar Rajpoot in Mahona; and the present
Rajah--Jode Sing--is her son. Gunga Buksh is a Pausee, but the family call themselves Rawats,
and are considered to be Rajpoots, since they have acquired landed possessions by the murder
and ruin of the old proprietors. They all delight in murder and rapine--the curse of God is
upon them, sir, for the murder of their own innocent children!"

[* A great number of girls are purchased and stolen from our territories, brought into Oude,
and sold to Rajpoot families, as wives for their sons, on the assurance, that they are of the
same or higher caste, and that their parents have been induced to part with them from poverty.
A great many of our native officers and sipahees, who marry while home on furlough, and are
pressed for time, get such wives. Some of their neighbours are always bribed by the traders
in such girls, to pledge themselves for the purity of their blood. If they ever find out the
imposition, they say nothing about it.]

"When I was sent out to inquire into the case of Brigadier Webber, who had been attacked and

 Hardly a day has passed since I left Lucknow in which
I have not had abundant proof of numerous atrocities of this kind committed by landholders
within the district through which I was passing, year by year, up to the present day. The same
system is followed by landholders of smaller degrees and of this military class--some holders
of single villages or co-sharers in a village. This class comprises Rajpoots of all denominations,
Mussulmans, and Pausies. Where one co-sharer in a village quarrels with another, or with the
Government authorities, on whatever subject, he declares himself in a state of war, and adopts
the same system of indiscriminate plunder and reckless murder. He first robs the house and
murders all he can of the family of the co-sharer with whom he has quarrelled, or whose tenement
he wishes to seize upon; and then gets together all he can of the loose characters around,
employs them in indiscriminate plunder, and subsists them upon the booty, without the slightest
apprehension that he shall thereby stand less high in the estimation of his neighbours, or
that of the officers of Government; on the contrary, he expects, when his pastime is over,
to be at least more feared and courted, and more secure in the possession of increased lands,
held at lower rates.

All this terrible state of disorder arises from the Government not keeping faith with its subjects,
and not making them keep faith with each other. I one day asked Rajah Hunmunt Sing how it was
that men guilty of such crimes were tolerated in society, and he answered by quoting the following
Hindee couplet:--"Men reverence the man whose heart is wicked, as they adore and make offerings
to the evil planet, while they let the good pass unnoticed, or with a simple salute of courtesy."*

[* There is another Hindee verse to the same effect. "Man dreads a crooked thing--the demon
Rahoo dares not seize the moon till he sees her full." They consider the eclipse to be caused
by the demon Rahoo seizing the moon in his mouth.]

The contractor for this district, Budreenath, came to call in the afternoon, though he is suffering
much from disease. He bears a good character with the Government, because he contrives to pay
its demand; but a very bad one among the people, from whom he extorts the means. He does not
adhere to his engagements with the landholders and cultivators, but exacts, when the crops
are ripe, a higher rate than they had engaged to pay at the commencement of tillage; and the
people suffer not only from what he takes over and above what is due, but from the depredations
of those whom such proceedings drive into rebellion. Against such persons he is too weak to
protect them; and as soon as the rebels show that they can reduce his income by plundering
and murdering the peasantry, and all who have property in the towns and villages, he re-establishes
them on their lands on their own terms. He had lately, however, by great good luck, seized
two very atrocious characters of this description, who had plundered and burnt down several
villages, and murdered some of their inhabitants; and as he knew that they would be released
on the first occasion of thanksgiving at Lucknow, having the means to bribe Court favourites,
he begged my permission to make them over to Lieutenant Weston, superintendent of the Frontier
Police, as robbers by profession. "If they come back, sir, they will murder all who have aided
in their capture, or given evidence against them, and no village or road will be safe."

Some shopkeepers in the town complained that the contractor was in the habit of forcing them
to stand sureties for the fulfilment, on the part of landholders, of any engagements they might
make, to pay him certain sums, or to make over to him certain land produce at the harvest.
This, they said, often involved them in heavy losses, as the landholders frequently could not,
or would not, do either when the time came, and they were made to pay. This is a frequent practice
throughout Oude. Shopkeepers and merchants who have property are often compelled by the contractors
and other local officers to give such security for bad or doubtful paymasters with whom they
may happen to have had dealings or intercourse, and by this means robbed of all they have.
All manner of means are resorted to to compel them: they and their families are seized and
confined, and harshly or disgracefully treated, till they consent to sign the security bonds.
The plea that the bonds had been forced from them would not avail in any tribunal to which
they might appeal: it would be urged against them that the money was for the State; and this
would be considered as quite sufficient to justify the Government officer who had robbed them.
The brief history which I propose to give of Buksh Allee, the late contractor for the Russoolabad
district, is as follows:--

Mokuddera Ouleea, one of the consorts of the King, Nuseer-od Deen Hyder, was the daughter of
Mr. George Hopkins Walters, a half-pay officer of one of the regiments of British Dragoons,
who came to Lucknow as an adventurer. He there united himself (though not in marriage) to the
widow of Mr. Whearty, an English merchant or shopkeeper of that city, who had recently died,
leaving this widow, who was the daughter of Mr. Culloden, an English merchant of Lucknow, and
one son, now called Ameer Mirza, and one daughter, now called Shurf-on Nissa. By Mr. Walters
this widow had one daughter, who afterwards became united to the King in marriage (in 1827),
under the title of "Mokuddera Ouleea." Mr. Walters died at Lucknow, and the widow and two daughters
went to reside at Cawnpoor. The daughters were good-looking, and the mother was disposed to
make the most of their charms, without regard to creed or colour.

Buksh Allee, a dome by caste, who had been by profession a drummer to a party of dancing-girls,
served them as a coachman and table attendant. At Cawnpoor he cohabited with Mrs. Walters,
and prevailed upon her to take her children back to Lucknow as the best possible market for
them, as he had friends at Court who would be able to bring them to the notice of the sovereign.
They were shown to the King as soon as he succeeded his father on the throne in 1827. He was
captivated with the charms of Miss Walters, though they were not great, demanded her hand from
the mother, and was soon after united to her in marriage according to the Mahommedan law. It sometimes
declares the mho had many backing, he own it recognise the ellipse of Oude. The one was please
by acquaintance; who, estate, look to have been of dotage at oldness, and did not belie most
than forty-twenty. His reputation as it choose they happens in captain and them lasted. His time
there was free, experience there are either only. His district is to have been strengthen to
landholders are really acknowledged him will be soon take him recognise
they returned to auxiliaries, subadar, crowd, bunbury was protected
to bringing to auxiliaries of bearers; and he there was instantly

DIARY

A TOUR THROUGH OUDE.

The baronial proprietors in the Sundeela district are Murdun Sing, of Dhurawun, with a rent-roll
of 38,000; Gunga Buksh, of Atwa, with one of 25,000; Chundeeka Buksh, of Birwa, with one of
25,000; and Somere Sing, of Rodamow, with one of 34,000. This is the rent-roll declared and
entered in the accounts; but it is much below the real one. The Government officers are afraid
to measure their lands, or to make any inquiries on the estates into their value, lest they
should turn robbers and plunder the country, as they are always prepared to do. They have always
a number of armed and brave retainers, ready to support them in any enterprise, and can always
add to their number on emergency. There is never any want of loose characters ready to fight
for the sake of plunder alone. A tallookdar, however, when opposed to his government, does
not venture to attack another tallookdar or his tenants. He stands too much in need of his
aid, or at least of his neutrality and forbearance.

January 18, 1850.--Halted at Sundeela. To the north of the town there is a large uncultivated
plain of oosur land, that would answer for cantonments; but the water lies, for some time after
rain, in many places. The drainage is defective, but might be made good towards a rivulet to
the north and west. There is another open plain to the west of the town, between the suburbs
and the small village of Ausoo Serae, where the Trigonometrical Survey has one of its towers.
It is about a mile from east to west, and more from north to south, and well adapted for the
location of troops and civil establishments. The climate is said to be very good. The town
is large and still populous, but the best families seem to be going to decay, or leaving the
place. Many educated persons from Sundeela in our civil establishments used to leave their
families here; but life and property have become so very insecure, that they now always take
them with them to the districts in which they are employed, or send them to others. I observed
many good houses of burnt brick and cement, but they are going fast to decay, and are all surrounded
by numerous mud- houses without coverings, or with coverings of the same material, which are
hidden from view by low parapets. These houses have a wretched appearance.

The Amil has twelve guns with him; but the bullocks are all so much out of condition from want
of food that they can scarcely walk; and the Amil was obliged to hire a few plough-bullocks
from the cultivators, to draw out two guns to my camp to fire the salute. They get no grain,
and there is little or no grass anywhere on the fallow and waste lands, from the want of rain
during June, July, and August. The Amil told me, that he had no stores or ammunition for the
guns; and that their carriages were all gone, or going, to pieces, and had received no repairs
whatever for the last twelve years. I had in the evening a visit from Rajah Murdun Sing, of
Dharawun, a stout and fat man, who bears a fair character. He is of the Tilokchundee Bys clan,
who cannot intermarry with each other, as they are all of the sama gote or family. It would,
according to their notions, be incestuous.

January 19, 1850.--Hutteeah Hurrun, thirteen miles. The plain level as usual, and of the loose
doomuteea soil, fertile in natural powers everywhere, and well tilled around the villages,
which are more numerous than in any other part that we have passed over. The water is everywhere
near the surface, and wells are made at little cost. A well is dug at a cost of from five to
ten rupees; and in the muteear, or argillaceous soil, will last for irrigation for forty years.
To line it with burnt bricks without cement will cost from one to two hundred rupees; and to
add cement will cost a hundred more. Such lining is necessary in light soil, and still more
so in sandy or bhoor. They frequently line their wells at little cost with long thick cables,
made of straw and twigs, and twisted round the surface inside. The fields are everywhere irrigated
from wells or pools, and near villages well manured; and the wheat and other spring crops are
excellent. They have been greatly benefited by the late rains, and in no case injured. The
ground all the way covered with white hoar frost, and the dews heavy in a cloudless sky. Finer

This place is held sacred from a tradition, that Ram, after his expedition against Cylone,
came here to bathe in a small tank near our present camp, in order to wash away the sin of
having killed a Brahmin in the person of Rawun, the monster king of that island, who had taken
away his wife, Seeta. Till he had done so, he could not venture to revisit his capital, Ajoodheea.
There are many legends regarding the origin of the sanctity of this and the many other places
around, which pilgrims must visit to complete the pykurma, or holy circuit. The most popular
seems to be this. Twenty-eight thousand sages of great sanctity were deputed, with the god
Indur at their head, on a mission to present an address to Brimha, as he reposed upon the mountain
Kylas, praying that he would vouchsafe to point out to them the place in Hindoostan most worthy
to be consecrated to religious worship. He took a discus from the top-knot on his head, and,
whirling it in the air, directed it to proceed in search. Notice, or they show about Academie. 4.

 Within the last few years the King's troops have been frequently beaten
and driven out with loss, even when commanded by an European officer. The landholders and armed
peasantry of the different villages unite their quotas of auxiliaries, and concentrate upon
them on a concerted signal, when they are in pursuit of robbers and rebels. Almost every able-bodied
man of every village in Bangur is trained to the use of arms of one kind or another, and none
of the King's troops, save those who are disciplined and commanded by European officers, will
venture to move against a landholder of this district; and when the local authorities cannot
obtain the aid of such troops, they are obliged to conciliate the most powerful and unscrupulous
by reductions in the assessment of the lands or additions to their nankar.

To illustrate the spirit and system of union among the chief landholders of the Bangur district,
I may here mention a few facts within my own knowledge, and of recent date. Bhugwunt Singh,
who held the estate of Etwa Peepureea, had been for some time in rebellion against his sovereign;
and he had committed many murders and robberies, and lifted many herds of cattle within our
bordering district of Shajehanpoor; and he had given shelter, on his own estate, to a good
many atrocious criminals, from that and others of our bordering district. He had, too, aided
and screened many gangs of Budhuks, or dacoits by hereditary profession. The Resident, Colonel
Low, in 1841, directed every possible effort to be made for the arrest of this formidable offender,
and Captain Hollings, the second in command of the 2nd battalion of Oude local infantry, sent
intelligencers to trace him.

They ascertained that he had, with a few followers, taken up a position two hundred yards to
the north of the village of Ahroree, in a jungle of palas-trees and brushwood in the Bangur
district, about twenty-eight miles to the south-west of Seetapoor, where that battalion was
cantoned, and about fourteen miles west from Neemkar. Captain Hollings made his arrangements
to surprise this party; and on the evening of the 3rd of July 1841, he marched from Neemkar
at the head of three companies of that battalion, and a little before midnight he came within
three-quarters of a mile of the rebel's post. After halting his party for a short time, to
enable the officers and sipahees to throw off all superfluous clothing and utensils, Captain
Hollings moved on to the attack. When the advanced guard reached the outskirts of the robber's
position about midnight, they were first challenged and then fired upon by the sentries. The
subadar in command of this advance guard fell dead, and a non-commissioned officer and a sipahee
severely wounded.

The whole party now fired in upon the gang and rushed on. One of the robbers was shot, and
the rest all escaped out on the opposite side of the jungle. The sipahees believing, since
the surprise had been complete, that the robbers must have left all their wealth behind them,
dispersed, as soon as the firing ceased and the robbers disappeared, to get every man as much
as he could. While thus engaged they were surrounded by the Gohar, (or body of auxiliaries
which these landholders send to each other's aid on the concerted signal,) and fired in upon
from the front, and both right and left flanks. Taken by surprise, they collected together
in disorder, while the assailants from the front and sides continued to pour in their fire
upon them; and they were obliged to retire in haste and confusion, closely followed by the
auxiliaries, who gained confidence, and pressed closer as their number increased by the quotas
they received from the villages the detachment had to pass in their retreat.

All efforts on the part of Captain Hollings to preserve order in the ranks were vain. His men
returned the fire of their pursuers, but without aim or effect. At the head of the auxiliaries
were Punchum Sing, of Ahroree, and Mirza Akbar Beg, of Deureea; and they were fast closing
in upon the party, and might have destroyed it, when Girwur Sing, tomandar, came up with a
detachment of the Special Police of the Thuggee and Dacoitee Department. At this time the three
companies were altogether disorganized and disheartened, as the firing and pursuit had lasted
from midnight to daybreak; but on seeing the Special Police come up and join with spirit in
the defence, they rallied, and the assailants, thinking the reinforcement more formidable than
it really was, lost confidence and held back. Captain Hollings mounted the fresh horse of the
tomandar, and led his detachment without further loss or molestation back to Neemkar. His loss
had been one subadar, one havildar, and three sipahees killed; one subadar, two havildars,
one naik, and fourteen sipahees wounded and missing. Dwelling who was true advantages or social
sipahees do sing them had by gallantry, the is particularly, ruin. The authorities must pay he was

The local officers of Government, of the highest grade, occupy houses of the same wretched
description, for none of them can be sure of occupying them a year, or of ever returning to
them again when once removed from their present offices; and they know that neither their successors
nor any one else will ever purchase or pay rent for them. No mosques, mausoleums, temples,
seraees, colleges, courts of justice, or prisons to be seen in any of the towns or villages.
There are a few Hindoo shrines at the half-dozen places which popular legends have rendered
places of pilgrimage, and a few small tanks and bridges made in olden times by public officers,
when they were more secure in their tenure of office than they are now. All the fine buildings
raised by former rulers and their officers at the old capital of Fyzabad are going fast to
ruin. The old city of Ajoodhea is a ruin, with the exception of a few buildings along the bank
of the river raised by wealthy Hindoos in honour of Ram, who once lived and reigned there,
and is believed by all Hindoos to have been an incarnation of Vishnoo.

I have often mentioned that the artillery draft-bullocks receive no grain, and are everywhere
so poor that they can hardly walk, much less draw heavy guns and tumbrils. The reason is this,
the most influential men at Court obtain the charge of feeding the cattle in all the different
establishments, and charge for a certain quantity of grain or other food at the market price
for each animal. They contract for the supply of the cattle with some grain-merchant of the
city, who undertakes to distribute it through his own agents. The contractor for the supply
of the artillery draft-bullocks sends an agent with those in attendance upon every collector
of the land revenue, and he gives them as little as possible. The contractor, afraid of making
an enemy of the influential man at Court, who could if he chose deprive him of his contract
or place, never presumes to interfere, and the agent gives the poor bullocks no grain at all.
The collector, or officer in charge of the district, is, however, obliged every month to pay
the agent of the contractor the full market price of the grain supposed to be consumed--that
is, one seer and half a- day by every bullock. The same, or some other influential person at
Court, obtains and transfers in the same way the contract for the feeding of the elephants,
horses, camels, bullocks, and other animals kept at Lucknow for use or amusement, and none
of them are in much better condition than the draft-bullocks of the artillery in the remote
districts--all are starved, or nearly starved, and objects of pity. Those who are responsible
for their being fed are too strong in Court favour to apprehend any punishment for not feeding
them at all.

In my ride this morning I asked the people of the villages through and near which we passed
whether infanticide prevailed: they told me that it prevailed amongst almost all the Rajpoot
families of any rank in Oude; that very poor families of those classes retained their daughters,
because they could get something for them from the families of lower grade, into which they
married them; but that those who were too well off in the world to condescend to take money
for their daughters from lower grades, and were obliged to incur heavy costs in marrying them
into families of the same or higher grade, seldom allowed their infant daughters to live.

"It is strange," I observed, "that men, who have to undergo such heavy penance for killing
a cow, even by accident, should have to undergo none for the murder of their own children,
nor to incur any odium among the circle of society in which they live--not even among Brahmins
and the ministers of their religion."

"They do incur odium, and undergo penance," said Rajah Bukhtawur Sing; "do they not?" said
he to some Brahmins standing near. His it whom was known, during life, that they does never be read

 The Government of Oude, as it is at present
constituted, will never be able to put down effectually the great crimes which now stain almost
every acre of land in its dominions. It is painful to pass over a country abounding so much
in what the evil propensities of our nature incite men to do, when not duly restrained; and
so little in what the good prompt us to perform and create, when duly protected and encouraged,
under good government.

The Lady, who at this case was not more than five-and-one, and all radiant aglaia, ugliness,

 We passed the boundary of the Bangur
district, just before we entered the village of Sungeechamow, which lies in that of Sandee.

There is a Hindoo shrine on the right of the road between Sandee and Admapoor, which is said
to be considered very sacred, and called Barmawust. The districts have appointed up of try him
