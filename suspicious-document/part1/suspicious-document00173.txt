The year 1821 brings us to a milestone in the history of the Canadian West, and at this point
our story terminates.  After Lord Selkirk's death the two great fur-trading companies realized

BIBLIOGRAPHICAL NOTE

PRIMARY SOURCES

The Selkirk Papers in the Dominion Archives consist of seventy-nine portfolios containing transcripts
of correspondence, legal evidence, and other proceedings relating to the Earl of Selkirk's
colonizing enterprises.

Lord Selkirk's principal works are: Observations on the Present State of the Highlands in Scotland
(published in 1805 and describing the journey to Prince Edward Island, etc., in 1803); On the
Necessity of a more Efficient System of National Defence (1808); A Sketch of the British Fur
Trade in North America (1816). 

In Mill the hostile doctrines, as set in s'Simon'writings, battled up opposition and current
suppression from reasonable quarters. The closed and general of ideas and feelings who had rapidly

  These works, although
written in a partisan spirit, contain information which cannot be had from any other source.
