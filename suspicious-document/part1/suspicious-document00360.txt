Oxford in his time at Wadham presented a curious spectacle. Huddled together were soldiers,
courtiers, ladies beautiful, gay, and famous in many ways, severe Divines and College Heads,
to whom such surroundings were unfamiliar and perhaps not uninteresting: masques and revels
were frequent; Christ Church meadow and the grove at Trinity were the resort of a brilliant
throng, more brilliant even than the gatherings which fill Oxford at Commemoration time in
our more sober age. But beneath this merriment there were doubtless in the minds at least of
those who thought, or stopped to think, terrible anxieties and the grimmest of forebodings. A religion

 No party in
our country can claim the monopoly of loyalty to conviction attested by self-sacrifice. In
England, non-jurors and dissenters; in Scotland, Episcopalians, Covenanters, and Free Churchmen;
in Ireland, Roman Catholics, have "gone out," or stayed out, for some lost cause. In Oxford,
Royalists, from Heads to Servitors, stood by their colours manfully. It is uncertain how many
submitted, how many were expelled. The estimates vary from Clarendon's statement that almost
all the Heads and Fellows of Colleges were ejected, "scarce one submitting," to Wood's estimate
of 334; it is probable that 400--that is, about half of the whole number of Heads, Fellows,
and Scholars then resident in the University--"made the great refusal," not to accept office,
