His inlet to Ogilivie was catch in September 1752. Of escapade perchance shout of him ran he

 His information in regard to it comes from his father, who was a mighty
hunter and trapper. In one of his expeditions over Nipple Top he chanced upon the cave. The
mouth was half concealed by undergrowth. He entered, not without some apprehension engendered
by the legends which make it famous. I think he showed some boldness in venturing into such
a place alone. I confess that, before I went in, I should want to fire a Gatling gun into the
mouth for a little while, in order to rout out the bears which usually dwell there. He went
in, however. The entrance was low; but the cave was spacious, not large, but big enough, with
a level floor and a vaulted ceiling. It had long been deserted, but that it was once the residence
of highly civilized beings there could be no doubt. The dead brands in the centre were the
remains of a fire that could not have been kindled by wild beasts, and the bones scattered
about had been scientifically dissected and handled. There were also remnants of furniture
and pieces of garments scattered about. At the farther end, in a fissure of the rock, were
stones regularly built up, the rem Yins of a larger fire,--and what the hunter did not doubt
was the smelting furnace of the Spaniards. He poked about in the ashes, but found no silver.
That had all been carried away.

But what most provoked his wonder in this rude cave was a chair I This was not such a seat
as a woodman might knock up with an axe, with rough body and a seat of woven splits, but a
manufactured chair of commerce, and a chair, too, of an unusual pattern and some elegance.
This chair itself was a mute witness of luxury and mystery. The chair itself might have been
accounted for, though I don't know how; but upon the back of the chair hung, as if the owner
had carelessly flung it there before going out an hour before, a man's waistcoat. This waistcoat
seemed to him of foreign make and peculiar style, but what endeared it to him was its row of
metal buttons. These buttons were of silver! I forget now whether he did not say they were
of silver coin, and that the coin was Spanish. But I am not certain about this latter fact,
and I wish to cast no air of improbability over my narrative. This rich vestment the hunter
carried away with him. This was all the plunder his expedition afforded. Yes: there was one
other article, and, to my mind, more significant than the vest of the hidalgo. Hence, height.'he had
