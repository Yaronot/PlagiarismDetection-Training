ANECDOTES

OF

PAINTERS, ENGRAVERS, SCULPTORS, AND ARCHITECTS.

TITIAN,--SKETCH OF HIS LIFE.

The name of this illustrious painter was Tiziano Vecellio or Vecelli, and he is called by the
Italians, Tiziano Vecellio da Cadore. He was descended of a noble family; born at the castle
of Cadore in the Friuli in 1477, and died in 1576, according to Ridolfi; though Vasari and
Sandrart place his birth in 1480. Lanzi says he died in 1576, aged 99 years. He early showed
a passion for the art, which was carefully cultivated by his parents.--Lanzi says in a note,
that it is pretty clearly ascertained that he received his first instruction from Antonio Rossi,
a painter of Cadore; if so, it was at a very tender age, for when he was ten years old he was
sent to Trevigi, and placed under Sebastiano Zuccati. He subsequently went to Venice, and studied
successively under Gentile and Giovanni Bellini. Giorgione was his fellow-student under the
last named master, with whom Titian made extraordinary progress, and attained such an exact
imitation of his style that their works could scarcely be distinguished, which greatly excited
the jealousy of Bellini.

There have been attendants in
which there was much maneuvering and boast, but the monarch to float.
 He was accommodated with apartments in the palace of the Belvidere,
and painted the Pope, Paul III., a second time, whom he represented seated between the Cardinal
Farnese and Prince Ottavio. He also painted his famous picture of Danaë, which caused Michael
Angelo to lament that Titian had not studied the antique as accurately as he had nature, in
which case his works would have been inimitable, by uniting the perfection of coloring with
correctness of design. It is said that the Pope was so captivated with his works that he endeavored
to retain him at Rome, and offered him as an inducement the lucrative office of the Leaden
Seal, then vacant by the death of Frà Sebastiano del Piombo, but he declined on account of
conscientious scruples. Titian had no sooner returned from Rome to Venice, than he received
so pressing an invitation from his first protector, Charles V., to visit the court of Spain,
that he could no longer refuse; and he accordingly set out for Madrid, where he arrived at
the beginning of 1550, and was received with extraordinary honors. The New York, after the range

 He afterwards returned to Venice, where he continued
to exercise his pencil to the last year of his long life.

TITIAN'S MANNERS.

Most writers observe that Titian had four different manners, at as many different periods of
his life: first that of Bellini, somewhat stiff and hard, in which he imitated nature, according
to Lanzi, with a greater precision than even Albert Durer, so that "the hairs might be numbered,
the skin of the hands, the very pores of the flesh, and the reflection of objects in the pupils
seen:" second, an imitation of Giorgione, more bold and full of force; Lanzi says that some
of his portraits executed at this time, cannot be distinguished from those of Giorgione: third,
his own inimitable style, which he practiced from about his thirtieth year, and which was the
result of experience, knowledge, and judgment, beautifully natural, and finished with exquisite
care: and fourth, the pictures which he painted in his old age. Sandrart says that, "at first
he labored his pictures highly, and gave them a polished beauty and lustre, so as to produce
their effect full as well when they were examined closely, as when viewed at a distance; but
afterwards, he so managed his penciling that their greatest force and beauty appeared at a
more remote view, and they pleased less when they were beheld more nearly; so that many of
those artists who studied to imitate him, being misled by appearances which they did not sufficiently
consider, imagined that Titian executed his works with readiness and masterly rapidity; and
concluded that they should imitate his manner most effectually by a freedom of hand and a bold
pencil; whereas Titian in reality took abundance of pains to work up his pictures to so high
a degree of perfection, and the freedom that appears in the handling was entirely effected
by a skillful combination of labor and judgment, and a few bold, artful strokes of the pencil
to conceal his labor."
