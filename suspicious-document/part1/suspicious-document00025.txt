I had been through the culture-seeking stage, and knew my Henry James; so I could read between
the lines of Sylvia's experiences. I figured her as a person walking on volcanic ground, not
knowing her peril, but vaguely disquieted by a smell of sulphur in the air. And once in a while
a crack would open in the ground! There was the Duke of Something in Rome, for example, a melancholy
young man, with whom she had coquetted, as she did, in her merry fashion, with every man she
met. Being married, she had taken it for granted that she might be as winsome as she chose;
but the young Italian had misunderstood the game, and had whispered words of serious import,
which had so horrified Sylvia that she flew to her husband and told him the story--begging
him incidentally not to horse-whip the fellow. In reply it had to be explained to her she had
laid herself liable to the misadventure. The ladies of the Italian aristocracy were severe
and formal, and Sylvia had no right to expect an ardent young duke to understand her native
wildness. 

11. Something of that sort was always happening--something in each country to bewilder her
afresh, and to make it necessary for her husband to remind her of the proprieties. In France,
a cousin of van Tuiver's had married a marquis, and they had visited the chateau. The family
was Catholic, of the very oldest and strictest, and the brother-in-law, a prelate of high degree,
had invited the guests to be shown through his cathedral. "Imagine my bewilderment!" said Sylvia.
"I thought I was going to meet a church dignitary, grave and reverent; but here was a wit,
a man of the world. Such speeches you never heard! I was ravished by the grandeur of the building,
and I said: 'If I had seen this, I would have come to you to be married.' 'Madame is an American,'
he replied. 'Come the next time!' When I objected that I was not a Catholic, he said: 'Your
beauty is its own religion!' When I protested that he would be doing me too great an honour,
'Madame,' said he, 'the honneur would be all to the church!' And because I was shocked at all
this, I was considered to be a provincial person!"

Then they had come to London, a dismal, damp city where you "never saw the sun, and when you
did see it it looked like a poached egg"; where you had to learn to eat fish with the help
of a knife, and where you might speak of bitches, but must never on any account speak of your
stomach. When i repay anybody of boots who bore inside then be especially as out, or not of swabbing aperture

12. I did not hear these stories all at once. I have put them together here because they make
a little picture of her honeymoon, and also because they show how, without meaning it, she
was giving me an account of her husband. 

There had been even fewer adventures in the life of young Douglas van Tuiver than in the life
of the Honourable Reginald Annersley. When one heard the details of the up-bringing of this
"millionaire baby," one was able to forgive him for being self-centred. He had grown into a
man who lived to fulfil his social duties, and he had taken to wife a girl who was reckless,
high-spirited, with a streak of almost savage pride in her. 

Sylvia's was the true aristocratic attitude towards the rest of the world. It could never have
occurred to her to imagine that anywhere upon the whole earth there were people superior to
the Castlemans of Castleman County. If you had been ignorant enough to suggest such an idea,
you would have seen her eyes flash and her nostrils quiver; you would have been enveloped in
a net of bewilderment and transfixed with a trident of mockery and scorn. That was what she
had done in her husband-hunt. The trouble was that van Tuiver was not clever enough to realise
this, and to trust her prowess against other beasts in the social jungle. 

Strange to me were such inside glimpses into the life of these two favourites of the gods!
I never grew weary of speculating about them, and the mystery of their alliance. How had Sylvia
come to make this marriage? She was not happy with him; keen psychologist that she was, she
must have foreseen that she would not be happy with him. Had she deliberately sacrificed herself,
because of the good she imagined she could do to her family? 

I was beginning to believe this. Irritated as she was by the solemn snobberies of van Tuiver's
world, it was none the less true that she believed in money; she believed in it with a faith
which appalled me as I came to realise it. Everybody had to have money; the social graces,
the aristocratic virtues were impossible without it. The rich needed it--even the poor needed
it! Could it be that the proud Castlemans of Castleman County had needed it also? 

If that guess at her inmost soul was correct, then what a drama was her meeting with me! A
person who despised money, who had proven it by grim deeds--and this a person of her own money-worshipping
sex! What was the meaning of this phenomenon--this new religion that was challenging the priesthood
of Mammon? So some Roman consul's daughter might have sat in her father's palace, and questioned
in wonder a Christian slave woman, destined ere long to face the lions in the arena. 

The exactness of this simile was not altered by the fact that in this case the slave woman
was an agnostic, while the patrician girl had been brought up in the creed of Christ. Sylvia
had long since begun to question the formulas of a church whose very pews were rented, and
whose existence, she declared, had to be justified by charity to the poor. As we sat and talked,
she knew this one thing quite definitely--that I had a religion, and she had none. That was
the reason for the excitement which possessed her. 

Nor was that fact ever out of my own mind for a moment. As she sat there in her sun-flooded
morning-room, clad in an exquisite embroidered robe of pink Japanese silk, she was such a lovely
thing that I was ready to cry out for joy of her; and yet there was something within me, grim
and relentless, that sat on guard, warning me that she was of a different faith from mine,
and that between those two faiths there could be no compromise. Some day she must find out
what I thought of her husband's wealth, and the work it was doing in the world! Some day she
must hear my real opinion of the religion of motor-cars and hand-woven carpets! 

13. Nor was the day so very far off. She sat opposite me, leaning forward in her eagerness,
declaring: "You must help to educate me. I shall never rest until I'm of some real use in the
world." 

"What have you thought of doing?" I inquired. 

"I don't know yet. My husband has an aunt who's interested in a day-nursery for the children
of working-women. I thought I might help this, but my husband says it does no good whatever--it
only makes paupers of the poor. Do you think so?" 

"I think more than that," I replied. "It sets women free to compete with men, and beat down
men's wages." 

"Oh, what a puzzle!" she exclaimed, and then: "Is there any way of helping the poor that wouldn't
be open to the same objection?" 

That brought us once more to the subject I had put aside at our last meeting. She had not forgotten
it, and asked again for an explanation. What did I mean by the competitive wage system? 

My purpose in this writing is to tell the story of Sylvia Castleman's life, to show, not merely
what she was, but what she became. I have to make real to you a process of growth in her soul,
and at this moment the important event is her discovery of the class-struggle and her reaction
to it. You may say, perhaps, that you are not interested in the class-struggle, but you cannot
alter the fact that you live in an age when millions of people are having the course of their
lives changed by the discovery of it. Here, for instance, is a girl who has been taught to
keep her promises, and has promised to love, honour and obey a man; she is to find the task
more difficult, because she comes to understand the competitive wage-system while he does not
understand it and does not wish to. If that seems to you strange material out of which to make
a domestic drama, I can only tell you that you have missed some of the vital facts of your
own time. 

I gave her a little lesson in elementary economics. I showed her how, when a capitalist needed
labour, he bought it in the open market, like any other commodity. He did not think about the
human side of it, he paid the market-price, which came to be what the labourer had to have
in order to live. No labourer could get more, because others would take less. 

"If that be true," I continued, "one of the things that follows is the futility of charity.
Whatever you do for the wage-worker on a general scale comes sooner or later out of his wages.
If you take care of his children all day or part of the day, he can work for less; if he doesn't
discover that someone else does, and underbids him and takes his place. If you feed his children
at school, if you bury him free, if you insure his life, or even give him a dinner on Christmas
Day, you simply enable his landlord to charge him more, or his employer to pay him less." 

Sylvia sat for a while in thought, and then asked: "What can be done about such a fact?"
