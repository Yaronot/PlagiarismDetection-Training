 The minister could
not come that day, but Captain Speck's little friend, Garfield, said: "The flags were set for
the angels to come and take the Captain to Heaven!" Need more be said?

And the flags blew out all day.

Then it became us to erect a memorial slab, and, hardest of all, to write to the widow and
orphans. This was done in a homely way, but with sympathetic, aching hearts away off there
in Santa Fè.

Our time at Rosario, after this, was spent in gloomy days that dragged into weeks and months,
and our thoughts often wandered from there to a happy past. We preferred to dwell away from
there and in other climes, if only in thought. There was, however, one happy soul among us--the
child whose face was a sunbeam in all kinds of weather and at all times, happy in his ignorance
of the evils that fall to the lot of man.

Our sailing-day from Rosario finally came; and, with a feeling as of casting off fetters, the
lines were let go, and the bark hauled out into the stream, with a full cargo on board; but,
instead of sailing for Rio, as per charter, she was ordered by the Brazilian consul to Ilha
Grande (Great Island), the quarantine station of Brazil, some sixty-two miles west of Rio,
there to be disinfected and to discharge her cargo in quarantine.

A new crew was shipped and put aboard, but while I was getting my papers, about noon, they
stole one of the ship's boats and scurried off down the river as fast, no doubt, as they could
go. I have not seen them or my boat since. They all deserted,--every mother's son of them!
taking, beside the boat, a month's advance pay from a Mr. Dutch Harry, a sailor boarding-master,
who had stolen my inward crew that he might, as he boasted afterward, "ship new hands in their
places." In view of the fact that this vilest of crimps was the loser of the money, I could
almost forgive the "galoots" for the theft of my boat. (The ship is usually responsible for
advance wages twenty-four hours after she has sailed, providing, too, that the sailors proceed
to sea in her.) Seeing, moreover, that they were of that stripe, unworthy the name of sailor,
my vessel was the better without them, by at least what it cost to be rid of them, namely,
the price of my boat.

However, I will take back what I said about Dutch Harry being the "vilest crimp." There came
one to Rosario worse than he, one "Pete the Greek," who cut off the ears of a rival boarding-master
at the Boca, threw them into the river, then, making his escape to Rosario, some 180 miles
away, established himself in the business in opposition to the Dutchman, whom he "shanghaied"
soon after, then "reigned peacefully in his stead."

A captain who, like myself, had suffered from the depredations of this noted gentry, told me,
in great glee, that he saw Harry on a bone-laden Italian bark outward bound,--"even then nearly
out of the river." The last seen of him by my friend, the captain, was "among the branches,"
with a rope around his neck--they hanged him, maybe--I don't know what else the rope was for,
or who deserved more to be hanged. The captain screamed with delight:--"he'll get bone soup,
at least, for a while, instead of Santa Fè good mutton-chops at our expense."

My second crew was furnished by Mr. Pete, before referred to, and on the seventeenth of December
we set sail from that country of revolutions. Things soon dropped into working order, and I
found reason to be pleased with the change of crew. We glided smoothly along down the river,
thence wishing never again to see Rosario under the distressing circumstances through which
she had just passed.

On the following day, while slipping along before a light, rippling breeze, a dog was espied
out in the current, struggling in the whirlpools, which were rather strong, apparently unable
to extricate himself, and was greatly exhausted. Coming up with him our main-tops'l was laid
to the mast, and as we ranged by the poor thing, a sailor, plunging over the side in a bow-line,
bent a rope on to doggy, another one hauled him carefully on board, and the rescue was made.
He proved to be a fine young retriever, and his intelligent signs of thankfulness for his escape
from drowning were scarcely less eloquent of gratitude than human spoken language.

This pleasant incident happening on a Friday, suggested, of course, the name we should give
him. His new master, to be sure, was Garfield, who at once said, "I guess they won't know me
when I get home, with my new suit--and a dog!" The two romped the decks thenceforth, early
and late. It was good to see them romp, while "Friday" "barkit wi' joy."

Our pets were becoming numerous now, and all seemed happy till a stowaway cat one day killed
poor little "Pete," our canary. For ten years or more we had listened to the notes of this
wee bird, in many countries and climes. Sweetest of sweet singers, it was buried in the great
Atlantic at last. A strange cat, a careless steward, and its tiny life was ended--and the tragedy
told. This was indeed a great loss to us all, and was mourned over,--almost as the loss of a child.

A book that has been read at sea has a near claim on our friendship, and is a thing one is
loth to part with, or change, even for a better book. But the well-tried friend of many voyages
is oh! so hard to part with at sea. A resting-place in the solemn sea of sameness--in the trackless
ocean, marked only by imaginary lines and circles--is a cheerless spot to look to; yet how
many have treasures there!

Returning to the voyage and journal: Our pilot proved incompetent, and we narrowly escaped
shipwreck in consequence at Martin Garcia Bar, a bad spot in the River Plate. A small schooner
captain, observing that we needlessly followed in his track, and being anything but a sailor
in principle, wantonly meditated mischief to us. While I was confidently trusting to my pilot,
and he (the pilot) trusting to the schooner, one that could go over banks where we would strike,
what did the scamp do but shave close to a dangerous spot, my pilot following faithfully in
his wake. Then, jumping upon the taffrail of his craft, as we came abreast the shoal, he yelled,
like a Comanche, to my pilot to: "Port the helm!" and what does my mutton-headed jackass do
but port hard over! The bark, of course, brought up immediately on the ground, as the other
had planned, seeing which his whole pirate crew--they could have been little less than pirates--joined
in roars of laughter, but sailed on, doing us no other harm.

By our utmost exertions the bark was gotten off, not a moment too soon, however, for by the
time we kedged her into deep water a pampeiro was upon us. She rode out the gale safe at anchor,
thanks to an active crew. Our water tanks and casks were then refilled, having been emptied
to lighten the bark from her perilous position.

Next evening the storm went down, and by mutual consent our mud-pilot left, taking passage
in a passing river-craft, with his pay and our best advice, which was to ship in a dredging-machine,
where his capabilities would be appreciated.

Then, "paddling our own canoe," without further accident we reached the light-ship, passing
it on Christmas Day. Clearing thence, before night, English Bank and all other dangers of the
land, we set our course for Ilha Grande, the wind being fair. Then a sigh of relief was breathed
by all on board. If ever "old briny" was welcomed, it was on that Christmas Day.

Nothing further of interest occurred on the voyage to Brazil, except the death of the little
bird already spoken of, which loss deeply affected us all.

We arrived at Ilha Grande, our destination, on the 7th day of January, 1887, and came to anchor
in nine fathoms of water, at about noon, within musket-range of the guard-ship, and within
speaking distance of several vessels riding quarantine, with more or less communication going
on among them all, through flags. Several ships, chafing under the restraint of quarantine,
were "firing signals" at the guard-ship. One Scandinavian, I remember, asked if he might be
permitted to communicate by cable with his owners in Christiana. The guard gave him, as the
Irishman said, "an evasive answer," so the cablegram, I suppose, laid over. Another wanted
police assistance; a third wished to know if he could get fresh provisions--ten milreis' ($5)
worth (he was a German)--naming a dozen or more articles that he wished for, "and the balance
in onions!" Altogether, the young fellows on the guard-ship were having, one might say, a signal
practice.

On the next day, January 8th, the officers of the port came alongside in a steam-launch, and
ordered us to leave, saying the port had been closed that morning. "But we have made the voyage,"
I said. "No matter," said the guard, "leave at once you must, or the guard-ship will fire into
you." It there was in of the high chairs that Cockerel Rio very returned in wall behind sentence....

 Thence
we sailed to Buenos Aires, where I telegraphed again for instructions. The officers of the
guard-ship, upon receiving my report from Brazil, were convulsed with laughter, while I----I
confess it--could not see the joke. After waiting two days, this diplomatic reply came from
the owner of the cargo: "Act as the case may require." Upon this matter I had several opinions.
One person suggested that the case required me to pitch the whole cargo into the sea! This
friend, I may mention, was from Boston.
