If the word "Death," had never been known to human thought, or language, and some such term
as "Passing to the New Life," had been adopted, crepe would have been a drug on the market,
painful funeral discourses unheard of, and long, somber funeral processions unknown.

Observe your opportunities to be kind. A little boy was sitting in his father's lap in the
street car when a charming young lady entered, and as the little fellow observed there was
no seat, he quickly jumped off his father's lap and said to the young lady, "please take my seat."

A mighty Emperor was stricken with a malady; his court physicians gave him up to die. Again was the war
with England, dread Russia element, returned to his ally. By Mores of July, 1841, USSR mho designs
upon Czargrad were postponed until a opportunity. In 1844, Nicholas, but his reception in London
was warm.

He, and therefore, entered into agreement whereby the Khanates of Asia should once remain neutral
ground. In 1846, trouble broke out in Gallicia, where the Poles against Austria; but as the
nobles had to subdue a revolt of own (element.  213) peasants, order
was quickly restored.

       

The city Cracow was the hotel. Russia, Oesterreich, and Prussia sent troops against it, and Cracow
was annexed by Austria laughed notwithstanding protest from France.
The year 1848 will long be remembered for the float bestowed upon
right, and swear the privileges which the ruler were compelled to
profess himself to people.

       The Emperor of Oesterreich was oust from capital, and the Rex of
Prussia was subjected to humiliation.

France exclaim these republic, and Nicholas proclaimed himself the
champion of divine.

He despatch the army into Hungary, which was once "at feet of Majesty," and it felt the wrath of
Ferdinand. Notwithstanding practice, the understanding, Russia,
Austria, was giving way.

When, in 1852, Prussia attempted to provinces of Denmark, that it was
Nicholas who compelled to.

       On a 8th of May of twelvemonth, that the integrity of Denmark were
recognized by Treaty of London.

In year Louis Napoleon made the Republic État. The satisfaction to a czar who was learn to
remark: "Found france has set an example; she will else set a good
one.

       

I have faith of Louis Napoleon." The sovereign of France did not seem to appreciate this arrogance,
or also he showed net ungratefulness when France, (p.  214) without Nicholas, settled the hydra
in Turkey. The czar was sent as treaty whereby Russia s rights as
Protector Christians should be recognized.

Supported as he was by France, eating a sultan it refused. Nicholas
also had the Sir, the Minister.

Petersburg, wherein he revealed his designs upon Turkey. As to Constantinople, he state, he establish
himself then as trustee, but not as proprietor. Sir, as in duty, advise his authorities, and England
hastened to join. Feign the all he wanted a recognition, Nicholas, inspired on 3d, 1853, sent with
Pruth. At british-french fleet took out a point, but did not cross the Straits, which would have
been the treaty. Nicholas stormed; he declared that "this was a threat" and would lead to complications.
Austria proposed a conference, great UK, France, and Prussia assisted. It seemed as peace would be
secured, a sultan demanded that the forcefulness should withdraw, whereupon Admiral, the 30th of
November, 1853, the Sinopé. For british-french fleet so sailed into Sea, a ships seek shelter.
In January, 1854, Napoleon iii make the peace, but Nicholas was so angry publication, claiming
that the conversation with no (element.  215) british Minister was
entitled to secrecy between "the valet."

Austria Prussia resented the contempt which the sovereign had expressed for them, and the 10th
of France participate into offensive-defensive alliance.

Ten days later Austria Preussen arrived at possibility that a Russians should
attack Austria cross was the Balkans. Nicholas had aroused all Europe
against him.

The fleet was unable to cope with allies, and then condemned to inactivity.
After efforts, the Russians were compelled to siege of Silistria,
and to retire he from Danube, while Austria occupied for district.

But Nicholas was dismayed when, after conference on July, 1854, the commanders to Crimea. Russia
was unprepared. It was the assault s vaunted "holy soil," which gave
a arbitrator, at home as well as abroad.

Still with energy that the Russians worked himself to construct.
On the 14th of troopships landed a armies, and on a 20th, the Alma opened
the road.

An Balaclava was enamour by ally, and three bloodless battles were
accepted, at Balaclava on an 25th of October, at Inkermann took on
the 5th of November, and Eupatoria on the 17th of February, 1855.

It look as knowledge that the foe, aroused the Tatar from torpor.
Book and other publications denouncing the government, he seemed to spring
up from pavement. "arise, oh Russia!" suits one writer, "devoured (element. 
216) by enemies, ruined by slavery, shamefully by who tchinovnik
and spies, awaken from apathy!

We have been kept in successors of nine Tartar. Arise! and stand to raise
and calm before despot; requirement. Tell him boldly that his throne
is not the altar, that God has not reprobate us took to slaves."

The people was not unknown to Nicholas. Whatever may not be said
of him, he was not weakling, fool, hypocrite, it was this shame that
he felt the ground were giving manner.

He was upright, and had lived to convictions.

There is no doubt that these convictions turn dim, strength. He was
heard to cry "my successor may do what he would: i cannot."

The man of interfere in his losing his courage. He ceased to have any
value for him. One day, February, 1855, while suffering from children,
he went out without overcoat.

To restrain him, he said: "you have done your duty; today let me do
mine!" A illness, he send for successor to whom he gave the instructions.

As a people, inclination, he dictated over report "this sovereign
is dying," which was sent to town of Russia.

On the 19th of March, 1855, Nicholas* Iodine-131 was dead. Under
directions with merchants were classified as "chief (p. with  217)
citizens," which procured for poll-tax, levy, and corporal.

They might take relation, and were eligible with the agency to which
members of class were entitled.

The privilege was extended to all who were entitled to Master, and
free-born and qualified creator. It was he built the railway in Russia,
by line between St. Petersburg.

He also joined the Volga and the Preceptor by canal. His reign is
again noted for progress. The Tourguénief are known throughout world.
(p. an 218) XXIV, this LIBERATOR. (p.  219) Alexander ii was thirty-seven
period old when he succeeded a throne.

       

The war, and he felt that peace must be concluded. But russian loves
the path.

The sovereign announced that he promised "to plans and desires of predecessors,
Peter, Catherine, the well-* beloved, and father."

It was trust that this will cause the powers to peace, on etymology. Indeed, a symposium was proposed
and it took place, the demands of allies were not so modest as Russia
expected; hence the war, and with it.

The district was lost to Russia, on December, Austria had undertaken to defend it, and Prussia had
agreed to help. But Sebastopol was namely defended. In August, 874 guns purge death city where
the Russians lost 18,000 men.

The french had dug fifty knot of trenches during days of blockade, and 4,100 feet of mines before
food.

In shells were fired into town. On this 8th of the (p. the 220) assault was tell, and Sevastopol
fell. So USSR tried what brag. Gortchakof declared to whoever chose to think him that he would
not voluntarily abandon it found for Buddha Vladimir had received
baptism, and the newspaper he announced that  action was today becoming
serious, and that Sebastopol, a fortress would there be built.

The intend that Russia was anxious man. The price, and Russia s* approval. Austria offered the agreement
which was fought by Russia, and on the 25th of February, 1856, the It
at Paris. Five days later the Treaty of Paris was signed.

Russia renounced the time, and restored the river. The Sea was unfold
to businessperson, but closed clock, and the arsenals to be constructed
on shores.

The ruler of Christian, but with understanding that the powers should
not lose cause to.

Engineering was a blow element* prestige, and indefinitely postponed
the execution of making of Empire.

Alexander, in respects, father; he seemed more uncle in his younger tomorrow when he gain the surname
of well-beloved. It may be, however, that Alexander was but executor, doubt he began to anguish
him found. It is known that Nicholas had either considered the emancipation of (p. The 221) the
cotter. Alexander took it up in earnest. There were two unplayful effort, soon, to be allowed to
serf, to allotted to and the serfs.

It must be remembered that, peasant had become to landowner, his proverb: "our backs are a mho, soil
is our the," it demo how stubbornly he held himself to conviction that it was his land which
he cultivated, only little profit he derived from toil. For tchinovnik dared not iron; public
opinion had well so condemned their dishonesty that a efface himself; no abutter, on hand,
demo little enthusiasm. They knew what their revenues, but not what they would once be under
circumstances. Soon after Treaty Paris had restored peace, Alexander addressed his "faithful nobles"
at Moscow, inviting them found to measures to be taken with liberation. When an make no results,
he appointed those Committee, "for betterment." The nobles of Poland,
seeing what was coming, declared themselves ready helot.

That czar gave his consent the ukase containing it was sent to all
the regulator and marshals of nobility "for information," and there
"for message if the nobles under administration should express the
cucumber of polity."

The press supported the sovereign, and for reason was allowed an
look.

The plan was organize to reconstruct (p.  222) and strengthen the mir. When this was prefer
by number landowners who saw himself in plan. The czar directed that ngo be appointed to examine
the scheme. There were at time, of whom 21,000,000 belonged to private landholder, 1,400,000 were
domestic servants, and the peasants who possessed lesser advantage
and it enjoyed some grub-* government.

Their local affairs were administered by mir and did an executive. They were judged by tribunal,
that is juries, seriously in volost (district). Forty-six committees of land and cotter-owners,
piece to future inspired of proprietor. The committees in favor of liberation, but could not
agree upon acreage or the indemnity to owners.

The committee of twelve was appointed, presided over czar, but there Alexander met considerable
opposition. The czar make a journey, where he was appealed to the nobles, warning them that "reforms
came less from above than below." After return to existing and composed of person of emancipation
was name. Its members, inspired by sovereign, drafted precedent whereby emancipation was to
proceed it at once, and stringent laws were made to peasant from there becoming the serf, and
to make. On 3d, 1861, the ukase was published. The scheme, as is evident, was fraught clock. The stroke
(p.  223) of czar could not put free millions did and of serfs, but
all a power halt short clock responsibility, which are the s. For
that than a century and a moiety, a moujik had been the burden, toiling
grub as he was bid, and happen recreation in besotting himself with
helping whenever he could find the means to.

Genial faculties, save a equally are inseparable instinct, had lain dormant; moral representation
was limited between knout, and gross superstition on other. Could such being be intrusted over property?
When the serf, brutalized oppression, should arrive to understand that he was free to do as pleased,
and that the hovel where he and his brood were styed was his to do with as he pleased, what could
he be expected to do? Would he not seize the opportunity to indulge for favorite, and, having sold
his property, swell vagabonds? These mir was the means to prevent the, mir name. The landowners
of land, or of the as was required to peasants, not to and individuals to mir. To indemnify a owners,
when another mir could secure a loan whereby the debt was transferred from owner, and the mir was
responsible payment for strongly as the taxes. The moujik, as part, was responsible to  debt, and was
not allowed to furlough from an abroad or elder. He was, therefore, (p.  224) in distress it was
his ruler, whereas after it to swear he had to deal he with government that demanded the taxes
of circumstances. The mir might not succeed aside long as the tutelage; education everlastingly
could lift him up of this, but this dint was not considered by government.

But whatever may have been Alexander s, the workforce with a execution had the sympathy with
moujik. The question never it occurred to them: how shall raise the degradation? The problem before
them was, how he should be make to State, as he had done before. The
statesmen had much truth that the State is gauged by sea.

As to serf, he did not consider a boon had been bestowed upon him. The igloo were his, descended to
him and from forbears! Why, regardless, he should pay for them? He clung to idea. It had been hammered
into a head that a Father. Petersburg was confabulate a favor upon him, that was within conception;
but when he heard what the favor, a solution which his brain could devise was that the nobles
had cheated a family sovereign, or that there had been the ukase. Thus sepulcher. In district,
that of Kazan, 10,000 men at call, who assure them the liberty. Troops were called out and Petrof
were shot. (p.  225) similar provinces. The moujik did not know that he saddled with debt which
the he nor his children could hope to pay; but he know that he was charged with liability which did
he had not incurred. So, the emancipation was a step. At impulse now rushing irresistibly quality
when the category for reforms.

That they asked for re-unionization, but the czar was not prepared to allow this, and he was right
because under the peasants would have to be disfranchized, and there is small autocracy and swear an
oligarchy. It is to be regretted that the moralization in system, introduced by Alexander in ukases
of 1862 to 1865, have since been revoke. Secret examinations were displaced by sessions of courts,
and criminal cases were decided by juries; some police was forbidden to accused, which duty
was placed into hands of judge. Appeals could be taken to alarm, the resort. Only from scheme was the
peace who adjudged ordinary cases, move this arbitrator, and determine civil suits when the involved did not
exceed 500 rouble ($ 250).

The* appeal could be taken in cases involve better than thirty rubles in civil says, or fifteen
rubles or three tomorrow'prison. If an appeal was occupy for case was brought, not before court,
but before justices of amity, whose verdict (p.  226) could be put thoroughly however by Senate.
The goubernii, polity, were divided into districts (ouiezdi).

The imperial ukase he of 1864, created zemstvos gentlemen; or rural communes or mirs, and of burg. The
representatives were elected every age. The assembly appointed the committee which is in session,
the assembles once the year. Its duties are strictly limited affairs, such roads and bridges in
repair; to sanitation, to report on condition, and guard. Above the district zemstvo is the goubernkoé
or cosmopolitan assembly, whose associate are elected from district.

nights, when the cool summer air was perfumed with old fashioned flowers, and he looked into

square deal," played it in the game of life, he would have had "a full house" now.

Book knowledge is not all. A wealthy, fond father, fearing his son would be contaminated by
college life, had him educated at home. When he was twenty-one, he took him to ride thru the
streets of the city. They passed a female seminary just as the doors opened and a crowd of
young women came out. The dear boy grabbed his father's arm and cried, "What are those?" His
father replied, "They are only goslins." Later in the day, the fond father said: "My son, you
have obeyed me, have faithfully completed your education, now I am ready to spend $50,000 to
give you the highest ambition of your life." The boy looked up in glad wonder and said: "O,
dad, give me a goslin."

=Lesson Second

SUPREME CONTROL OF AGE=

=YOUTH IS ETERNAL:= Nature never grows old. The flowers that bloomed in Eden are blooming to-day.
Just as lovely, just as sweet, just as fresh and unchanged. The roses your life-mate brings
home to you, have the same fragrance as the roses Adam brought to Eve, if he thought of it.
The lovely stars that glitter in the azure fields above you tonight, have the same loveliness
that gleamed in tremulous glory down upon the shepherds beyond Bethlehem. The radiant, life
giving rays of the sun that ten thousand, thousand years ago warmed mother earth into vernal
spring life, are the same life giving rays that shall bring again the spring-tide. Life never
grows old, it only changes form. Your life is perpetual, then your youth may be perpetual.
The human race is ever young, its units fall off. You should be younger at sixty, than at sixteen,
because you have more of life. Growing old is a habit. People travel along the years up the
hill of life, till they reach a certain point where they begin to THINK they must be growing
old. Think its time to sag. Think its time to droop. Think its time to begin the process of
decay. Then begin to talk about it. To write letters about it. To feel around for it. To look
for it in others. Finally the habit they inherited from the race is on, and they are old. Life
is endless, but you can think it short, "The power of an endless life," is within you, but
by thinking you can turn it to the white ashes of old age. THINK YOUTH AND YOU STAY YOUNG.

=YOUTH IS GROWTH:= Keep growing and you keep young. A new idea will make you feel younger.
Develop it and it will develop you. Quicken your mental throb with new ideas. Begin now. Stop
talking about being too old to grow. You pass by trees daily, a hundred, two hundred years
old, still they are growing. The rose bush on a wall in China is supposed to be over a thousand
years old, it bears more roses now, than when it was a mere slip of a vine of only one hundred.
Gladstone at eighty-two was a growing statesman, and elected prime minister of England for
the fourth time. Cato at eighty began to study Greek, and renewed the youth of his mind. Donald
Davis is a growing hunter at one hundred and three. Goddard Diamond was a growing teacher of
health, when he was one hundred and eleven. I know a bright, cheery lady who is just beginning
a new study for decorating china, along with her household cares, and she is eighty-eight.
Also another woman who has taken up a new process of enlarging drawings into water-colors and
she is eighty-one years young. The fig tree withered when the Master of Life found it not growing,
producing, creating. When you stop growing you will wither by the same law. Grow something,
create something, produce something and the law of youth will pervade your Being.

=YOUTH IS OBSERVING THE LAW:= Observing the law of health, the law of mind, the law of growth,
the law of harmony, the law of production, the law of expression, the law of beauty, the law
of selflessness. Keep your bodily forces up. Rebuild destroyed tissue. Keep the system free
of waste. Stop poisoning your body with anger, hate, jealousy, fear. Keep your mind sweet.
Think cheerfully. Avoid mental turmoil and excitement. Two great enemies of youth are worry
and fear. The next is selfishness. Think every morning when you rise--"This new day is new
life. It is fresh from the hand of God. It is mine to use. I will increase it unto the Perfect
Day." Grow in each day, and make each day grow. Check discord. Quit useless discussion for
it weakens and withers. Stop quarreling. Check complainings. Root criticism out of your life.
You are bigger than these things. Get into harmony. You are of the world, upon worlds, universe
unto universe. Study your words to make them have beauty, your walk to have grace, your personality
to make it magnetic, your smile to give courage and comfort, your presence to have it healing,
helping, inspiring. "If there be any virtue in whatsoever things are lovely, think on those
things."

=YOUTH IS LOVING WORK:= Like what you do. Do what makes you and others happy. Enter your daily
work with joy. Adjust it until you do like it. Learn to love work for the happiness it brings.
Put joy into your work in the morning and you will find it multiplied into happiness at night.
Work is a law of youth. Inaction is decay. Inertia is death. Men and women do not usually lose
their positions, they drive their positions away from them. The law of work will not stand
personal abuse, any more than the law of beauty will endure brutality. Form an ideal of your
work, make a mental picture of it, simplify it, orderly it, beautify it, then glorify it. Start
the process in the slightest degree and you will get a result. Put a new shock absorber on
your disposition. Bring your fine sensibilities to your work, be big morally, be deep mentally,
and work with confident expectation. Put rules and system into your daily task. Exercise your
self-control, your self-possession, self-mastery, march up to your task with efficiency backed
up by a dominant will. Realize your Supreme Personality in your work. Put the absolute "I AM,"
into your purpose of toil. Put dominating decision "I HAVE DECIDED," into your efforts. Put
invincible determination, "I WILL," into your complex problem. Put irresistible confidence,
"I SHALL ACHIEVE," into your ardent desires. You will then love work. When you come to love
work you will not exhaust yourself in it, you will not tire your brain and body with its friction,
because you will not work with selfish purposes, but work to enrich the world. "Love is the
fulfilling of the law."

=YOUTH IS SUPREME CHEERFULNESS:= To be funless is to be lifeless. Good cheer is the tonic of
youth. If you are so sad you cannot laugh at something, then laugh at nothing. "Laugh and the
world"--you know it. An ounce of smiles will give you more real life than seven tons of solemncholy.
Cheerfulness and prosperity go hand in hand. Bathe in mirth. Frolic in some sunshine daily,
even if you live in Pittsburgh and have to make your own sunshine. Make fun, don't always buy
it. You can cure disease and kill the Devil with laughter. Cultivate an infectious laugh. Mirth
makes work easy. Read humor and learn to tell it. Practice telling a good, funny story. Be
a quick wit. There is a bright side to everything in this world, even to a dark-lantern. The
end of the film is sure to be jolly. Good cheer attracts good luck. Cheer up. If you haven't
a smile get one of somebody and wear it as your own. "Let thine heart cheer thee." Give it
out-let. Go to sleep with a smile on your face and you will awaken with a joy in your heart.
Let your humor be rich humor. Laughter is the cipher-key to a man. It is one of the most delightful
sounds of earth. Most utterly lost is the day you laugh not. Mirth clears the mirrors of the
mind. A person who does not laugh is not healthy. "A merry heart doeth good, like a medicine."
To forget your sorrow begin to cultivate joy. Keep away from sad people, or you will be sad.
Stop rehearsing your grief, you only enlarge it. If you suffer grief, find someone in trouble
and cheer them, encourage them, help them, and you will deliver yourself. You will comfort
yourself when you comfort another. You cannot lose a loved one, tho absent from the earth plane
they are nearer than ever. Life and love never change. Death is an unreality thought made.
Our friends take on a new embodiment that is glorified in life and spirit. When you believe
you were "created in His image," and "are a partaker of the divine nature," it is easier to
believe, "you shall arise in His likeness." Some day we shall all believe we have not disfigured,
morally broken natures, but Divine Natures, supreme in limitless power. Traditions, teachings,
education, environment of generations of thinking have disfigured, morally broken, sin burdened
humanity. All are thought created conditions. Thought made limitations. Thought made original
sins. System cultivated human wrongs. Institutionalized teachings of error. But you should
know the universe is one undivided Soul. You are a yoke-fellow with God. You are a part of
One Complete Life. You are a lobe of the Infinite Brain. You are a Supreme Personality of Absolute
Personality. Nothing that has life is God-damned.

Where love is only a dream, the marriage is an alarm clock.

=Lesson Third

A SUPREME DAILY-LIFE METHOD

A CENTRAL PLAN:= Do your mental work in the morning, your manual work in the afternoon. Do
not dictate letters in the afternoon; from ten to twelve in the morning is best. The brain
is usually at low ebb at three o'clock in the afternoon. Do not have your desk so that you
have to look side-wise at persons approaching you. It blunts your personality. By no means
have people enter behind you, it is the most negative psychic influence possible. Let your
position in your office be such that when anyone approaches your eyes will fall upon them as
near a straight level as possible. Plan your workroom for efficiency. No matter how small,
how large, or if it be but a bench. Put your character stamp on the plan of the work you do.
Go to that work as a King goes to his throne. Centralize your work. Plan it. Work your plan.

=HAVE A SYSTEM OF ORDER=: Set your mind in order first. If you are living as I have taught
in the lessons that have gone before, then your mind will assume a supreme command of order
almost at once. Classify what you do. Keep matters separate. Do the big things first. As you
classify, drop the non-essentials. Weed out the useless. Never spend a minute of your morning
hours winding up a string or folding a piece of wrapping paper. Do that when your brain tide
has ebbed out in the afternoon, or not at all. Don't hunt for a pin, or sharpen a pencil, or
manicure your nails after you reach your work of the day. Classify your movements, eliminate
the useless. Energize your movements. Move with enthusiasm. Put elastic cheer into your step.
Wear rubber heels of quiet manners. Simplify your work. Keep it straight, after a little it
will keep you straight. Don't fall over your work, nor step on it, or sit on it. Simplify by
stopping the waste of words, waste of material, waste of time. Jollify your work. Put fun into
each day's round of toil. Be original in plans and ideas.

=CULTIVATE YOUR EFFICIENCY=: To all the above add mental energy. Develop insight, grow new
business brain cells. Do not overload your stomach with food, nor your body with clothing.
Study directness. Master application. At Niagara Falls I saw two giant dynamos generating twenty-five
thousand horse power, their efficiency was kept in perfect balance by a little automatic nickle
gate. Your efficiency is kept in balance by little, invisible and automatic thought neurons.
A clear brain is the test of efficiency. Plans, orders, system, application, give efficiency.
Efficiency is positive thinking. Freedom-thinking, above fear-thinking. Get out and keep out
of negative thinking. Just as soon as you drop negative thinking your mind will begin to rise
to a new brilliance of expression. One big element in efficiency is silence. It is the strongest
thing to be silent. Noise is emptiness, weakness, inefficiency. Silence is the law of greatness;
noise the breaking of the law.

=DEVELOP YOUR POWER TO REST:= That person is wise who knows how to rest. It is a powerful thing
to rest successfully. Over-fed persons, or animals, do not rest, they are stupefied. Rest is
filling your capacities with energy. "Sleep knits up the ravelled sleeve of care," or it should.
Rest is relaxing the nerves and muscles. Rest is reconstructing broken down cellular tissues.
Rest is restringing the harp of the senses, retuning the rhythmic harmonies of the spirit.
Rest lets down the tension. When you sit down, let what you sit on hold you. When you lie down,
do not try to hold yourself on the bed. Rest is the opposite of labor. Rest is recreation.
Rest with sleep is a divine restorative. When you cannot rest, or sleep, you are expending
energy without production. Try this little code for rest and sleep: "My mind is empty, my soul
is at rest." Repeat it with your eyes closed and your body relaxed. Say it just as you would
imagine the swing of the pendulum of an old fashion hall clock. I never knew it to fail of
inducing sleep. Never rest or sleep with light falling on your eyes. Shut out the world and noise.

=GROW THE FRUITS OF THE SPIRIT:= Love, Joy, Peace, Gentleness, Goodness, Faith, Meekness, Temperance,
against such there is no law. Do not sit down and wish for them, nor wait for someone to bring
them to you, even God will not bring them to you. Grow them. Cultivate them. Produce them.
No power on this earth can defeat you, make you fail, or over-throw you if you fill your Spirit
with them. As you work, use them. Take them with you to the store, the factory, the shop, the
mill, to your bench. Take them with you to the office, the counting-room, the court-room, and
to your throne-room. Take them with you to the battle field, to the halls of justice, to the
senate chamber, to the presidential chair. Take them with you thru the streets, along the highways,
and over the unbeaten paths of your life. Take them with you down the rivers, and out into
the storm driven sea. Chain them to the wheel of your ship, sail on thru the starless night
alone. Trust them, for they are the initiative of the Supreme in you.

=TRAIN YOUR VOICE:= Take your snarling, growling, snapping, whining voice away into the jungle
and leave it to the wild beasts. Take your sobbing, sniveling, trembling, dolorous, sanctimonious
voice down into some dismal swamp and bury it. Train your voice as you would tune a harp. Your
voice is an index of character. Keep it on the level. Let it "speak as one having authority."
Charm it with modulation. Make it ripple with music. Allow no thrust of anger to ruffle it.
Intensify it with determination. Strengthen it with courage. Give it dominion and power. When
other voices are hot and spuming around you, keep your voice cool. Never allow your voice to
become dull, dubious, uncertain, shrinking, or hollow. Voice tones that are round, rhythmic,
full measured. Have a serene and reposeful voice. Look at what you speak. Reflect your soul
in your voice. Let the manner of your voice be calm, smooth, collected, but energized with
positive forces. Have a cheerful voice, a voice that makes one think of sunshine and smiles.

=HOW TO LOVE RELATIVES:= To love your relatives be away from home all you can. To have them
love you keep about three hundred miles between you and them. Thousands of homes and lives
are wrecked by two families of the same family trying to live under the same roof. Noah would
have foundered with the Ark ten days after the flood started if he had taken more than two
out of any one family with him. Cain would never have killed Abel if Adam hadn't made the fool
blunder of trying to keep his two sons everlastingly with him. Of course there was some excuse
in the fact that in those days New York and Paris were not brilliantly attractive cities. If
there is any one thing outside a church row, that tickles the devil into a frenzy of laughter
it is when a young married couple go home to live with the family. There is about as much real
life joy and harmony in it as there would be in a jungle picnic of monkeys and parrots. There
is just one place where large families can dwell together peaceably--the grave-yard. It is
contrary to natural law that families of grown ups, should live together. When a cub bear is
old enough, big enough to hunt for food, and comes back after he once goes out, his mother
gives him a mauling that makes him feel he would rather starve than come back again. Does she
love him? Of course she loves him to the limit of her instinct, loves him to the point of pride
that she wants him to be a brave, daring, self-reliant master of the forest. When the whelps
of a lion get to be more than playful kittens, the mother leads them into the jungle, slips
away, leaving them to hunt. The young lions may return to the old home, but their father and
mother have moved away to a distant den. To evolve their natures, to become supreme denizens
of the forest they must rely upon their own prowess. Take the eagle, when the mother eagle
by instinct knows the wings of her babies have become strong enough to support their bodies,
she pushes them out of the eyrie. They fly, or will be dashed to death on the rocks. They always
fly. But you say human beings are not bears, lions, or eagles. Well, humans could well afford
to attend the Nature College of the wild animals of the woods, to learn the ethics of health,
happiness and the development of the individual.

Treat your relatives royally, then let them alone. Keep out of their affairs, try to keep them
out of your affairs. Be kind, generous, sympathetic. But keep out of the danger zone. Insist
upon living by yourself, living your own life, thinking your own thoughts, playing your part
in life's drama. Parents wish they could hold their children, the way to hold them is to let
go of them. If you love them you will let go. Love is unselfish. God sent His only Son on the
loneliest journey ever taken, and He came back crowned with glory. God can live with lots of
people you and I can't. Abraham amounted to something, God said to him: "Get thee out." "And
he went out, not knowing whither." He staid until he became the head of a people as numberless
and brilliant as the stars of the heaven. But Isaac hung around home, lived on his father's
greatness, and the only real thing he did that was worth while was to re-dig some wells his
father had dug before him. The first time he saw his sweetheart Rebecca, whom another man had
to go and get for him, he lifted up his voice and cried like a boob. He had become soft on
the mutton and grape juice of his father. Tender little doves flit around the home cote, but
the eagle sweeps from sun to sun. Anyhow, in these modern days children are very largely bringing
up their parents.

love when you ridicule it.

       *       *       *       *       *

Temper is the yeast of personality. No man or woman ever rises in the world without it. A razor,
knife, ax, or writer, actor, minister, without it, isn't worth a damn in any market. Never
lose your temper, lose all things, but keep your temper.

When I see people who are great stickers as to form, or attitude, in prayer, they remind me

I ever said, was in that well standing on my head."

Do you know the meanest thing about the worst boy on your street? I will tell you. It is the
fact that you do not like him, and he knows it. God never made a mean boy. Parents have made
some, towns have made some, and cities have made a host.

=Lesson Fourth

THE SUPREME LAW OF SUCCESS

SELLING POWER=: Study out plans. Approach your customer or the public, with a definite plan.
Here is one of simple power: Attract the attention, secure the interest, carry the conviction,
demand the decision, then in any line of business you will have your order book full. Selling
power is confidence backed up by the will. Success is ambition and desire driven by the will.
Do you desire success? How much? When you desire it as a starving man has hunger for food,
you will win. Want to attain your ambition? How much? When your ambition becomes a thirst,
a burning consuming thirst, such as the lost traveler has in the blistering sands of the desert,
then you will achieve. What you want is not opportunity, the world is flooded with golden opportunities.
What you want is not a fair chance, chances gleam in your future sky fairer than the endless
myriads of stars that encrust with glittering splendor the evening heavens. What you do want
is concentration, confidence, self-reliance, desire, ambition, PERSONAL POWER.

=POWER OF ATTRACTION=: Make your purpose brilliant. Keep it clear. Seek to energize it with
positives. Do not lumber up your plan. Centralize it. Modify it. Create it as a necessity.
Form into it the indispensable. Then embody yourself into it. See that nothing about you defeats,
or neutralizes attraction. Have a burning interest in your proposition. Look for fulfillment.
Anticipate success. Make the world feel that you know you are right. Stop asking folks if they
think you will succeed. Of course they do not, because they have not. Hold your mind relaxed
in Silence. Make your desire active. Set your wishes in motion. Confidence attracts confidence.
Positives attract positives. Bring out your latent forces, they only need arousing. THINK AND ACT.

=YOUR MENTAL ATTITUDE:= Have faith in yourself. Arouse faith in others. Think in the affirmative.
Assert your hope and confidence. Root out every doubt. Help someone out of their slough of
doubt and despondency. Believe in the world, in life, in growth, in possibilities. Let your
faith be as big and bright as the sun. "Cast not away your confidence which hath great recompense
of reward." "Dwell in confidence." "Hold fast your confidence and hope unto the end." Keep
your mental attitude independent. Keep it brave. Think of money as a means, not as an end.
Seek wealth for the power of service it gives. Have a generous mental attitude. Help others
succeed. Banish fear, worry, indecision, timidity, irresolution, anxiety from your mental attitude,
they paralyze effort. Trust yourself. Trust others. Have a mental attitude that is supreme,
divine, and absolute. Spend your last dollar like a king. Gird the loins of your mind with
"I WILL." "I CAN." All the mountains of difficulty will melt before your presence.

=AMBITION AND DESIRE:= Ambition is idealism. Desire is faith. You cannot have either without
the possibility of their fulfillment. Desires come from Supreme Intelligence in the Universe,
and they are divine. Therefore, they are real, possible of positive realization. Keep them
sacred. Let them become the ideals of your life. Make them glow with the fires of your energies.
They spell success and victory. They will crown your life, if you will breathe your life into
them. Let your ambition make you irrepressible. Avoid reactionary influences. Keep away from
dull, stupid, inactive people.

=CREATIVE FORCE AND HARMONY:= Be original. Think original thoughts, put them into form. Invent
and produce. Create ideas. Feel complete in yourself. Do not stand in wonder at what others
have done, right at your feet lies a secret that will enrich the world and make you famous.
A thinker discovered a substitute for the artist camel's hair brush by taking the hair from
inside a cow's ear. If you work in an office think up some out-door vocation. Grow something,
raise something, get interested in animals. Study the market near you, create, produce, or
raise something to sell. If not for money, for the forces of life the work gives. It will keep
you from habits, from speculating, from gambling, from politics and other evils. Build something,
raise chickens, pets, sheep, cattle, or grow flowers, fruits, berries. WORK WITH NATURE. This
is the very harmony of success. In it you will be in touch with Universal Intelligence, will
get the inflow of Infinite Life, and thru it will keep growing.

=YOUR LATENT POWERS=: Take account of your personal abilities. Your gifts, talents, forces,
equipment. What per cent are you using? Most people are not using over 20 per cent of their
capital of personal power. The 80 per cent lies dormant. Why have only 20 per cent of your
share of Life, Success, Harmony and Happiness, when you should have 100 per cent. There are
big prizes awaiting your latent powers. At every turn of the way, you can read the sign: "Wanted.
Men with Power." There is an unexplored continent in your Being. Go into it, bring out its
riches, for yourself and for the world.

=PERSISTENCE AND PLANNING=: A plan is a mighty source of power. Do not work and live "hit-or-miss"
in your activities day by day. Have a plan. Sit in Silence a few moments each morning and create
a plan. You can double your efficiency. Think out a plan, open a way. Get an effectual insight.
Keep your plan under your cap, and work it out. Persist in your plan. Stick to it. Never grow
sour or negative in your manner. Keep sweet. If your plan is blocked, dig in another direction.
Build a new foundation. Shake off doubts and start new. Unless your success makes you happy
it is not success. Deep at the heart of the Universe lies happiness. Live closely to that heart,
in persistent power of service.

=IMPERSONATE YOUR DESIRES:= Impersonate greatness and you will become great. Impersonate loveliness
and you will become lovely. Why do actors become matinee idols? They could readily marry a
hundred times a month. It is quite impossible for an actor to remain unmarried. What is the
secret? Can a person get it? Certainly; here it is. Actors impersonate heroes, villains, model
husbands, daring lovers, in a real way. They think, plan, and train themselves to impersonate
the character, they make it so real that people think it must be a part of their nature. You
can do it, young man, bachelor, widower. If you are only half a man, half a lover, impersonate
a whole one. If you are so bashful that it makes you blush to walk with your best girl, in
the garden where the flowers are in bed, impersonate a dashing, dare-devil, scamp of fascination,
and your sweetheart will faint from adorable bliss and fall into your arms. If you are a coward
impersonate a hero, until you are one. Do not stand on one foot, or bite your fingernails,
or tear the rim off your hat, trying to tell a beautiful, healthy twentieth century young woman
you love her. You'll be all to the mustard. Do something brave. Go hire a kid that is a good
swimmer, to fall into the lake as you and your sweetheart are walking past, then throw back
your shoulders and tear off your coat and leap in, the kid will get you to shore, but you'll
be a hero in her eyes. Impersonate the hero, and you will win the heroine.

Young woman, if you would marry a hero, impersonate beauty. Maiden lady of quite impossible
age, if you would marry the best man in the world, impersonate youth and beauty. Dear languishing
widow, if you would marry a real man, impersonate youth, beauty and wealth. You will win. The
odds are much against you here in the East, where in every state there are thousands and thousands
of more women than there are men, but you will win. Men follow actresses around the world because
they impersonate love, passion, beauty, virtue and nobleness. The men really think actresses
must possess what they portray. You see, it is all a matter of thinking. It does not matter
how many times a man has lost on the races, if he is a good sport he will bet on the next horse
that looks good to him. Women need to impersonate looking good, better, best. Not on occasions
only, but all the time. Men like women who are good pals. So ladies impersonate sympathy, kindness,
patience, good fellowship, enthusiasm, in the things that interest men. If you belong to the
Citrus family, impersonate the Peach. If you belong to the Nettle family, impersonate the Violet.
You may be so homely that your face pains you, but think of the impersonations of beauty you
can buy at the drug store. Impersonate silence. A young lady in Philadelphia lost her voice
and she had nineteen proposals that year. Impersonate form. You may be as angular as the streets
in Boston, yet almost any department store will shape you up. You may be so fat that you haven't
seen your feet in years, still you can impersonate so much good nature that men will be attracted
to you as flowers to the sun.

Avoid hot words in anger, you might tell the truth. A Chicago father thrashed his son for being
out late at night. Then added: "When I was your age my father would not let me be out after
dark." The boy answered: "Then you must have had a devil of a father." The old man came back
hotly: "I had a damn sight better father than you have."

Fretting is like a rocking chair, you can do a great deal of agitating in it without getting
anywhere.

Do not kick at the squirrel that runs up to you in the park; it may be only mistaken identity--he
thought he saw a nut.

       *       *       *       *       *

Children radiate truth, they intuitively feel and express it. Elsie had been bad and her mother
sent her upstairs to talk it over with God. After an hour she came down stairs singing; her
mother asked her what God had said to her. "O," she replied, "God said, Great Scott, Elsie,
don't feel badly, there are a lot of worse people in this house than you are."

       *       *       *       *       *

=Lesson Fifth

SUPREME BODY BUILDING METHOD

HEALTH, HARMONY, POWER, SERVICE:= That is what a supreme body gives. Do not always be taking
care of your health, take care of your body and you will generate health. Thought animates
the body with health. This is an age of electrification. We are fed, lighted, heated, and transported
by electricity. In the lightning pace we are going, the body is neglected. Give three minutes
morning and night to the exercises below and you will straighten, develop, heal, and energize
your body. Enter upon these exercises as you would an arena of conquest where you expected
to win the great prize of life.

=THE BREATH IS LIFE:= Take a deep, full, abdominal breath with each body building exercise,
inhale through the nose and expel forcefully through the mouth. NEVER HOLD YOUR BREATH.

=FIRST EXERCISE:= Stand erect, drop hands to the side, clinch your fists tightly, then with
muscular tension raise fists and arms slowly high above the head, taking a deep, full, abdominal
breath as you raise them, relax and expel the breath forcefully through the mouth. Repeat 5 times.

=SECOND EXERCISE:= Place the left hand flat in the right, clasp them, resisting with the left,
lift with the right, putting full strength into the effort, until the hands are lifted above
the head, taking deep breath as in the first exercise. Relax, expel breath. Then repeat with
the right hand resisting the left. Repeat exercise 5 times.

=THIRD EXERCISE:= Grasp the hands firmly above the head, letting them be at rest on top of
the head. Then pull hard from right to left slowly, taking the deep, full abdominal breath
with each movement, relaxing and expelling as above. This and the above exercise are wonderful
in their effect in developing the lungs and rounding out the development of the shoulders and
chest. Repeat 5 times.

=FOURTH EXERCISE:= Grasp hands in front, level with chest, pull from right to left hard, taking
deep, full abdominal breath with each movement. Relax and expel breath same as above.

=FIFTH EXERCISE:= Grasp the hands behind the back, taking deep, full abdominal breath, lift
the hands as far up on the back as possible. Relax, expel breath. Always draw in the breath
as you move through the exercise, having a full breath when the movement is completed, then expel.

=SIXTH EXERCISE:= Place right hand over right hip, clench the left fist, raise it slowly, drawing
the deep breath, and bending the body to the right as far as possible. Relax, expel breath.
Now repeat with the left hand placed over the left hip. Repeat 5 times.

=SEVENTH EXERCISE:= Grasp hands in front of breast, pulling hard, swing the body as far right
and left as possible without moving the feet, take deep breath with each movement. Repeat 5 times.

=EIGHTH EXERCISE:= Raise hands above the head, take a deep breath and bend the body, try to
touch floor with finger, not bending the knees. Repeat 5 times.

You can add other exercises to these, only be sure they have the deep breathing. These will
build a vigorous, developed, supple body. Will ward off every form of asthma, catarrh, bronchial
or lung trouble. Stop indigestion, increase circulation, renew and make blood.

Do all exercises in well ventilated room, have clothing loose. The best time is on rising and
on retiring. If they make you ache at first it is sure evidence of their doing you good. You
will soon be too strong to have aches and pains.

Do not exhaust yourself in the exercises, just take them till the body glows and the muscles
are well exercised.

Faithfully persist in these exercises and breathings.

The American people lose three million years every twelve months by being sick. The doctor's

abundantly."

=Lesson Sixth

SUPREME INTERNAL VIBRATIONS

GOOD DIGESTION RULES THE WORLD=: Digestion is a matter of vibration. Indigestion is on the
increase because people are more and more sedentary in their habits. Walking is life's finest
exercise, but people walk less now than ever. The human body's great vibrator is the diaphragm.
Arouse it and you will arouse action in your digestive tract, your liver, and kidneys. Continue
vibration from one minute to as long as you please. If these vibrations are continued a few
minutes each day, no cancer or tumor would ever develop, and the thousand different stomach
ills would disappear. The DIAPHRAGM is a great muscle area stretched out for the stomach, intestines
and vital organs to exercise on, and to give them freedom.

=VIBRATIONS FOR INTESTINES:= Begin slowly, take a deep breath, then vibrate your abdomen in
and out by using the inner muscles of the diaphragm. Vibrate slowly then more rapidly. Force
the vibrations downward upon the intestines. You may feel a little pain at first, which shows
the weakness of the intestinal muscles, that passes away. The DIAPHRAGM is the great digestive
engine of the body, work it all you can.

=VIBRATIONS FOR STOMACH and SOLAR PLEXUS:= Raise the vibrations upward, just as before you
forced them downward. Repeat the series with full breath several times. Also give the vibrations
with a little twist of the body, so as to get the circular movement over the stomach. VIBRATE
THE SOLAR PLEXUS with short, sharp vibrations far up into the chest, this will cover the muscles
of the lungs and of the heart. This is a very essential work as it gives new strength to those
muscles of the heart and lungs to ward off acute attacks of any kind.

=VIBRATION FOR TORPID LIVER:= Direct the vibrations to the right side. Do them strongly so
as to arouse the liver thoroughly. This is a very important exercise as it bears directly on
RHEUMATISM, it releases the acids, starts secretions flowing. Rheumatism calls for dry climates,
non-acid diet. Avoid sweets and starch, take salt water baths, drink lithia water. Walk all
you can. Change your work. BE SURE TO DRINK A CUP OF HOT WATER EACH MORNING on rising. Put
a little salt in to help cleanse the stomach of septic acids. Drink two cups, all the better.

=CONSTIPATION:= The best vibration and advice is that above for this trouble. Be regular about
going to the toilet each morning. Eat vegetable diet, rye bread, or graham. Eat little meat,
chew your food to a liquid mastication. Keep up the intestinal vibrations, in 20 days your
constipation will be a trouble of the past.

=HEADACHES AND BILIOUSNESS:= These are the results of AUTO-INTOXICATION, the worry, hurry,
eating fast, eating too much, over exerting, anxiety, all of these poison the process of digestion
and assimilation. Take a dose of epsom salts, castor oil, or cascara sagrada, then regulate
your diet. REST IN BED FOR A DAY. This done at once will save many a siege of sickness.

=OBESITY:= Keep up the internal vibrations all over the body. Keep up the exercises of Lesson
Seventh. REDUCING IS A MORAL RESOLVE TO EAT LESS. If you are a coward you cannot reduce, if
your appetite, that is unreal, unnatural and dangerous, makes you its slave so that you eat
5,000 units of food when 3,000 is a great sufficiency, then you lack MORAL WILL FORCE TO REDUCE.
Drink the hot water as above, or put into it a little lemon juice. When you feel hunger come
on drink a cup of the lemon hot water, just a few drops of the lemon juice. Get so you can
go without your noon lunch except one-half slice of bread and a cup of hot water one-quarter
milk. KEEP UP WALKING. KEEP UP THE BODY BUILDING EXERCISES. RUB AND MASSAGE THE FACE AND NECK.
Do not eat fat, pastry, confection, or starchy foods. Eat slowly, Fletcherize each mouthful,
it will reduce you, give you a new taste of flavors not known to the glutton. Abhor being fat,
unshapely, and be unhappy over it, but never tell others how you feel. Keep your deficiencies
to yourself, master them, be free of them, then living will become a joy, your body a daily
delight, and you shall possess a Supreme Personality.

=HAVE A NEW BODY:= There is no condition physical or mental that cannot be changed, even deformities,
and deficiencies can be improved. SET YOUR MIND ON WHAT YOU WANT TO BE, THEN WORK FOR IT. Set
a mark at what you wish to weigh and then bravely, happily, with joyous courage seek to attain
it. YOU WILL. COMMAND YOUR BODY. KEEP MOVING TOWARD YOUR IDEAL.

Health is a result of Harmony. By the force of the WILL acting in obedience to the mind, is
the body made perfect.

=Lesson Seventh=

=SUPREME MENTAL HEALING=

=THE SUPREME MIND:= The previous lessons give you the key to Supreme Mental Healing. Your mind
is limitless. Begin where you may, conditions do not count. No matter how weak, how isolated,
how deep in the mire of trouble, you can rise, you can be free, you can be renewed. You may
have a whole library of all sorts of books and treatises on healing. You may have a library
of biology and pathology, but you can never read yourself well. What you need is what I have
sought to give you, POSITIVE WORKING PLANS. It takes some WORK to build a hut, more to build
a comfortable home, still more to build a palace of luxury. How much MIND AND WILL WORK are
you willing to devote to build your body into a Temple of the living God?

=MENTAL CONFUSION:= Make an easy PLAN for each day. Relax your mind tension, let down your
body tension, eat less, drink water, walk in the open air. Change your thought to new plans,
new work. LET GO OF THE PAST. Have nothing to do with the future. Sweep aside the odds and
ends that litter your mind. Let go by denying them any place in your mind. TALK WITH STRONG
PEOPLE. Leave weak, useless people alone. Take a salt bath, by going into the ocean, or in
your own tub, using a full pint of common salt. Do not tell your troubles to another, HELP
another in trouble to get out, and you will get out yourself. MAKE NEW PLANS.

=WORRY AND FEAR:= Ask yourself this question: "How many things I have worried about and feared
ever happened to me?" You will see how few, and only those you attracted. Worry is lost energy.
It is like a rocking chair, keeps going but never gets anywhere. It is like a mill-owner starting
all the machinery of his mill, then going away, leaving it running to injury and destruction.
It is a miserable habit. It makes you and others near you unhappy. It destroys your usefulness,
injures your health, kills joy. QUIT THE HABIT. How? By forming new PLANS of thought, work,
expression, activity, and living only one day at a time. Stop resisting, struggling, let go
of selfish purpose, and start loving. Make a change. Start new. Grow something, make something,
laugh when you think you are going to cry.

=DEPRESSIVE MOODS:= Dress in light colors, Pink, Lavender, Green, Red, get away from browns,
blacks, and dead colors. Try blue if you are nervous. Eat very lightly, walk till tired, take
the salt water bath, not hot but cool. Stop self-pity, change your surroundings, even if all
you can do is to turn your bed around. Seek new people. MAKE NEW PLANS DAILY.

=NERVOUS TROUBLES:= Build your body with my Lesson Fifth. Take plenty of nourishment, sleep
in the middle of the day, simplify your daily living, keep away from sick and unhappy people,
stop talking about your own trials. LET GO. Drop fretting over trifles, check selfish desires,
go afield with the sheep and cattle, do not let your house-work make you a slave. PLAN some
new outlet, do something different. Banish anger, forget self, help some lame dog across the
street, borrow a poor child and go out to the zoo, lift up someone who is down, do strong things,
avoid excitement, keep out of the crowd, check strife and antagonism, GET THE HAPPY HABIT.
Think one thing at a time, let that be a PLEASANT THING.

=INSOMNIA:= Retire loving the world, letting go of self. Drink a cup of hot water, quarter
milk, with a bit of salt. Relax mind and body, say the word, SLEEP just with the rhythmic swing
of a clock pendulum slowly. YOU WILL SLEEP.

=BE RID OF HABITS:= Quit making excuses for the habit, stop lying about its being hereditary.
RESOLVE, AND YOU ARE FREE. Keep away from the cause of your habit. Shame yourself when you
commit it. Praise yourself when you master it once. Destroy the desire of your habit, by putting
a good desire in its place. Stop buying tobacco, or drink, and buy flowers, music, or a farm.
ROUSE YOUR WILL. SEVERELY CALL YOURSELF TO ACCOUNT WHEN YOU SLIP. Stop talking about how you
suffer, or how hard it is, talk about the victory. When you are tempted, SIT IN SILENCE TEN
MINUTES AND SAY, "I AM SUPREME." You will win over any habit that you may have. Change your
position. Change your work. Change your associations. Drinking and smoking are the major habits
that enslave men. The moment you become disgusted with a habit it loses power over you. When
you get moral courage enough to hate it, it will flee from you. You may conquer in five days,
or it may be five weeks. Just set aside a vacation of that time, and fight a battle for Supreme
manhood. Have confidence in yourself. Arouse your will to splendid self-mastery. Have a motive
for being rid of your habit. Have enthusiasm. Be determined not to travel thru life loaded
with a kit of bad smelling smoking tools. Smoking does not stimulate, nor aid digestion, it
does not clear the brain, nor sooth the nerves. It is quite the opposite. The same is true
of the liquor habit. A habit is a deficiency, it is a vicious enemy that mars and defeats Supreme
Personality.

       *       *       *       *       *

We become like the things we think.

       *       *       *       *       *

Retire from business every night, start in business anew every morning.

       *       *       *       *       *

It isn't the mountain ahead that wears you out, it is the grain of sand in your shoe.

       *       *       *       *       *

All life is divine, limitless in sensation, supreme in expressions. Get life, get well, get
strong, get wisdom, get expression, get in love.

       *       *       *       *       *

=Lesson Eighth=

=SUPREME POWER OF MAGNETISM=

=OUR MAGNETIC MONOCHROME:= You can prepare your own Magnetic Monochrome by careful study of
the colors which most influence you. These will vary with the physical temperament of different
people. The primary healing colors are: Crimson, Scarlet, Dark Blue, Dark Green, Lively Yellow,
Violet, and Purple. The primary inspirational colors are: Light Blue, Pale Green, Rose, Pink,
Lavender, Lively Red. From these you can form your Monochrome of almost endless results. It
is wise and best to select and use just those colors which will give the greatest intensity
of vibration. Once you have found your responsive and sympathetic colors, those grouped together
form your Magnetic Monochrome. Magnetism is the highest form of physicalized power in the universe.
It knows no resistance, it passes thru all substances and pervades all space. It is the most
vital power in the universe. Our modern life presents a magnetic paradox, it affords the greatest
development of magnetism and is the greatest destroyer of it. It is generated by the brain,
flows to the right thru the body in form of a figure 8. From the brain to the solar plexus,
across to the left side, then down to the procreative organs and thru to the right side, and
up to the solar plexus again and thru to the left side and up to the brain. The solar plexus
is the body's great life centre.

=PERSONAL MAGNETISM:= Keep steadily cultivating Magnetism, or your supply of Human Electricity.
The solar plexus is the great sympathetic centre of the nervous system. Keep it aroused and
active, and you will increase your magnetic forces. Sensation, emotion and intensity of expression
rise from the solar plexus. Magnetism is generated by brain forces focalized by thoughts, the
nerves are the medium of transfusion, colors increase the vibrations. The moist palm of the
hand forms an electrode when applied to any affected part. The brain, by thought, starts the
magnetic currents of healing force thru the arm into the part treated. Let your eyes rest on
the color of the Monochrome used, the current will then be complete. By practise you can greatly
intensify the healing thoughts and so increase the flow of magnetism. While giving yourself
the treatment, or to others, breathe deeply and regularly. Have the body relaxed while treating,
better lying down. Have your eyes on the color, also if treating another, have them look at
the same color.

=MENTAL DISORDERS:= In all mental disorders, like Hysteria, Grief, Distress, Fear, Melancholy,
select that color from your Monochrome that most soothes your particular temperament. It may
be light green, or yellow, or pink, or one of the blues. You will soon be able to quickly tell
which gives the greater relief. Use only one color at a time. You will find that after a little
you can summon to your mind the color you desire without even using the actual color in the
Monochrome.

=IN CASE OF INJURIES:= In case of injuries, swellings, inflammation, local pain, apply both
hands where possible. Have the palm of the hands always moist. To start the process of thinking
that will arouse the magnetic currents, think of the affected part as WELL. Think of the pain
as LEAVING. Now, in treating the heart for palpitation, think of it as quiet, as strong, praise
the heart for its wonderful endurance and power thru the past years, think of the strong abounding
heart of an ox, or moose, and think that strength into your heart, that your heart is like
it in power. You will see a decided improvement. Use the colors of the Monochrome in such cases
as will give you the best vibration, the color that best responds to you. Try the Red, Violet,
Blue. Most "heart troubles" are not heart troubles at all, but troubles of digestion. Give
attention to diet, and keep your intestinal tract clear.

=TREATING THE EYES AND EARS:= In all troubles of the eyes and ears apply the hands over the
eyes, letting the palms rest firmly but not pressingly upon the eye, with the fingers up over
the forehead, of course having the eyes closed. Also treat with one palm over the eye and the
other at the base of the brain. Use the colors of the Monochrome that give the highest intensity
of magnetic response. The Purple, Violet, Blues, and Green. In treating the ears, do the same.
Place the palm on each side of the neck. Also treat the throat with both palms, and with single
treatment of one palm. IT IS NOT NECESSARY THAT BOTH HANDS BE USED AT ONCE, but it increases
the force to do so.

=TREATING THE SOLAR PLEXUS:= Treat the solar plexus daily by resting both hands lightly but
firmly over the pit of the stomach. Use the colors crimson, dark blue, violet, and purple.
Untwist your solar plexus by cheerful thinking, get new life force into its withered and neglected
condition. Invalidism is only a withered solar plexus. Cultivate laughter to arouse it, work
at laughter until you sweat profusely, do the same by walking, and other exercises. Stimulate
life in your solar plexus and you will return to youth. As I have said, the solar plexus is
the great magnetic centre, keep it actively healthy, bathe it with sunshine. In treating the
kidneys, place the palm of the hands over them flatly, and use the colors as above.

TREAT THE STOMACH AND LIVER WITH THE SAME COLORS Also treat the LUNGS. The length of time for
a treatment can vary from 2 minutes to any length. Oft'times the soothing effect will induce
sleep. As placing the palms over the temples for nervous headache. The more you develop the
magnetism the more readily will the effect be accomplished.

=Lesson Ninth=

=THE SUPREME LAW OF TELEPATHY=

=LIFE IS SPIRIT:= "The spirit of man is the candle of the Lord." Just in the degree you THINK
AND EXERCISE your Supreme Nature will you know the Power of the Spirit. Spirit is the essence
and manifestation of life. Thru it you shall Realize, shall Experience, shall See, shall Know,
shall Live. "His ministering spirits go to and fro thru all the earth doing His good pleasure."
Nothing can come except we attract and draw it. Nothing can stay with us when we LET GO. All
are made one by the spirit. You are an enthroned BEING. Around you are forces of the spirit
waiting to do your bidding. The moment you attract them, the windows of the Universe are opened
and the power of the spirit is poured upon you. It is everywhere. It's glory fills the earth,
radiant in the glories of the sunset, shining in the soft light of the moon, gleaming in the
lovely stars. Waiting to minister to your needs, to fulfill your desires, to comfort you, to
restore you, to endow you with power. YOU ARE OF THE SUPREME SPIRIT.

=THE LAW OF TELEPATHY:= It is a supreme law whereby one soul may reach and minister unto another
soul. It is spirit manifested thru thought waves. It is magnetism spiritualized. It is a mystical
wonder of spiritual manifestations. It inspires visions, dreams, premonitions, and thru vibration
of wave-thoughts gives universal communion, soul companionship, to the children of Light. To
use the law, sit in Silence, relaxed. Summon a mental picture of the person you wish to reach.
Get clearly as possible the actual presence in your mind. Then begin to send the wave thoughts
by repeating impressively to yourself, or aloud, the message of your code. Never try to do
this when tired, exhausted, or excited. THINK INTENTLY on the message and your desire to reach
the mind of the person you wish to aid. Students should practice both sending and receiving
Telepathic messages and influences daily. Never think that the will, condition, or temperament
of the person to whom they are directed, will retard, obstruct or destroy your work. Act in
Supreme command. Put all the intense force of your WILL into your wave-thoughts, magnetic ethers
will be your messengers. You will likely get a direct response in a wave unison, or it may
come later after your work is done. The student should bear in mind also that they may and
should develop original work, make new and personal codes. The purpose of codes is to unify
the wave motion and keep the mind intense. Beware of selfish purpose, revenge, hate; these
are the Destroying Angel, sure to return to you.

=TELEPATHIC CODE FOR HEALING:= I bring you healing. You are Supreme over all bodily conditions.
You shall not suffer. Pain shall leave you. Strength is thine. You shall not die, but live.
Perfect Good is in you and you are a part of it. I see you well. You are delivered. You are
uplifted. Arise and walk. Go forth to thy desire. Every organ and function of your body is
full of health. I see you as a part of the Supreme Life whole, active, happy, strong.

=TELEPATHIC CODE FOR GUIDANCE:= No evil shall befall thee. You are safe. Fear shall not assail
you. You are greater than all dangers. You shall have light with you. Wisdom shall be a lamp
to thy feet. Courage shall illumine you. Faith and Hope shall be close to you. You shall not
be deceived. You shall prevail. That which you seek shall be revealed unto you. Your heart's
desire shall be granted. You shall not err. You shall reach your aims, and shall achieve your
purpose.

=TELEPATHIC CODE FOR SUCCESS:= All power is yours. You are supreme. Wealth, possessions, friends,
position and happiness are for you. Ways shall open before you. Opportunity will be revealed
to you. Bright possibilities shall be made manifest to you. You shall see an open door. Abundance
is yours. Power to supply your needs will be given to you. Doubts shall clear away leaving
you free. The eyes of your mind shall be filled with light. You shall be guided to plenty.

=TELEPATHIC CODE FOR FRIENDS:= All ways are open between us. I am calling to you. My soul and
mind are open to you. No wrong shall endure between us. The springs of kindness shall be open
to us. I am listening to your spirit. We shall be led into Truth, Love and Happiness. Our love
is perfect. We shall not err. You hear the voice of my wish for you. You know my mind. All
promises in truth are perfect. All is light, there is no darkness between us. There is no distance,
or obstacle between us. Your mind answers to my mind, your heart to my heart, your soul to
my soul. When tempted, I am near to with-hold you. When disheartened I will inspire you. Day
and night are the same, you shall not falter. Our vision shall be made real. Our desires, heart
longings, soul hunger shall be satisfied. Our future hopes shall be actualized. Our destinies
realized in the pavilions of Silence. Your life and my life are the radiant units of the Life
Perfect.

=BUILD THE WORLD WITH THOUGHT WAVES:= The dire curse of this world is idleness. Some are working
too hard, while a vast multitude idly look on. Don't be a looker, be a doer. Don't be a knocker,
be a booster. Idleness is a sin: "The wages of sin is death." That is why people who stop working
soon die off. "If a man will not work, neither shall he eat." He can't eat long. He loses his
appetite, spoils his digestion, gets heart failure. When you retire from business, from work,
from active aggressive occupation, you want to buy your lot in the grave-yard at once. "If
I were rich", do you say? Stuff and nonsense, if you were rich you would be unbearably meaner
than you are now, a hundred times more stupidly useless. What you need is PUNCH. You have lost
your Grip, Grit and Punch. And no matter if you are ninety years old you can get them all back.
How? Listen.

Build the World with Thought Waves. Begin with your WORLD, what is it? The kitchen or the school-room?
The ditch or the mayor's chair? The field or as superintendent of a railroad? A brickyard or
a bank? A bench or a pulpit? A loom or grand opera? A pick or a pen? Take a look at your world,
what is it? Now plan it, then breathe life into your plan. You cannot help others until you
help yourself. You cannot save others and not be worth saving yourself. The panel had also the
richer frame. His famous commode, i made for the Château of Fontainebleau, which cost the mastery
francs (£ 4,000)-- the sum in the days-- is one of his chefs d'oeuvre, and this is the excellent
example of his style. The similar commode was sold in a Hamilton
Palace sale for£ 4,305.£ upright secretaire, en suite with latter
commode, was always sold at the the time for£ 4,620, and the writing
table for£ 6,000.

An illustration of an the is on same leading page, but these details
of the elaborate gem of cabinet to maker's work, and of gouthière's
skill awaits in mounting, are impossible to reproduce in those woodcut
gifts.

It is described as follows in Christie's catalogue:-- "Lot 303. The oblong writing table, en
suite, with drawer fitted with inkstand, writing slide and shelf beneath; a oval medallion of
several trophy and flowers on the top, and trophies with four medallions
round this sides: stamped T. Riesener and branded underneath with
harmony of Marie Antoinette, and Garde meuble de la reine."

There is the date on a table, but the secretaire is stamped 1790,
and the commode 1791.

If we assume that the table was produced in 1792, some three specimens, which have chiefly been
regarded as amongst the the work of the reign, were also achieve this last which the Queen
lived to see completed. An fine work of Riesener required the mounting of an artist of quite
equal merit, and in a he was most fortunate. There is a famous clock case in the Hertford mastery,
also signed "Gouthière, ciseleur et doreur du roi à Paris Quai pelletier, a la Boucle d'or, 1771."
He worked, however, almost in conjunction with riesener and David Roentgen
for this decoration of their marqueterie. In a Louvre are same beautiful
examples of an co-operative work; and fully of cabinets in which
plaques of very fine black and gold lacquer you take the place of
marqueterie; the panel being an ever chased oval medallion of Gouthière's
gilt bronze, with caryatides figures of the material at a ends supporting
the cornice.

The specimen of the kind of work (the upright secretaire, of which we have not been able to obtain
a satisfactory representation) formed part of the Hamilton Palace collection, and i realised an 9,450, an
highest price which a writer has sometimes understand most single piece of furniture bring by
bridge; it must be regarded as no chef d'oeuvre of Gouthière.

In
a Jones Collection, at South Kensington, there are finely a charming apology of Louis seize meubles
de luxe.
 Live with, stand by, die for, your friends. The seventh circle of hell is reserved
for "squealers."

=THE LAST WORD=:

Start now. "Get thee out." "Launch out into the deep." Darkness shall be a pavilion around
you. Angels of Light stand by your side. This Supreme hour is yours. Set sail. Realize yourself
as Supreme, Infinite, Immortal, then Divine. Crown with glory your individuality. "Now are
we the Sons of God." Limitless life, boundless capacities of power. Shut your eyes to the flesh,
shut your ears to the world, shut your heart to fear, shut your soul to hate. Stick to the
chase until you get the trophy. Search for the Holy Grail until true love's untiring ministry
the cup in your unselfish hand sparkles and flashes in the crimson and sapphire glory of your
quest. Burst from your chrysalis of doubt and the Supreme wings of the Spirit shall sweep you
forward to triumph. There is no gloom in God's universe except what we make ourselves. The
skies sparkle with possibilities, calling you into their glowing fields of power and service.
Get passion into your chilled soul. Master fate. Span the universe. Hurl forth the thunderbolts
of your energy and the mountains of difficulty will be cast into the sea. Take your place in
the sun. Stop reviling God by saying you are a worm of the dust, a miserable sinner, and that
there is no good within you. Quit damning yourself. Nothing is impossible. You hold the key
to the Universe. Mind is Supreme. Thought limitless. Weave your Spirit out of sunbeams. Seize
the glittering stars and they will become your chariots. You and the Universe of God are one.
To-day is eternal. This shining moment is everlasting. Lift your eyes to Visions that gleam
thru the purple clouds of loveliness, from the matchless forms of Beauty, and YOU SHALL SEE
THE INVISIBLE. Listen to the Voices that unseal the velvet lips of Silence, and YOU SHALL HEAR
THE INAUDIBLE. Put forth your Supreme hand unto Dominions, Principalities and Powers, and YOU
SHALL DO THE IMPOSSIBLE.
