INTRODUCTION.

Johnson's "Lives of the Poets" were written to serve as Introductions to a trade edition of
the works of poets whom the booksellers selected for republication. Sometimes, therefore, they
dealt briefly with men in whom the public at large has long ceased to be interested. Richard
Savage would be of this number if Johnson's account of his life had not secured for him lasting
remembrance. Johnson's Life of Savage in this volume has not less interest than the Lives of
Addison and Swift, between which it is set, although Savage himself has no right at all to
be remembered in such company. Johnson published this piece of biography when his age was thirty-five;
his other lives of poets appeared when that age was about doubled. He was very poor when the
Life of Savage was written for Cave. Soon after its publication, we are told, Mr. Harte dined
with Cave, and incidentally praised it. Meeting him again soon afterwards Cave said to Mr.
Harte, "You made a man very happy t'other day."

Johnson, struggling, found Savage struggling, and was drawn to him by faith in the tale he
told. We have seen in our own time how even an Arthur Orton could find sensible and good people
to believe the tale with which he sought to enforce claim upon the Tichborne baronetcy. Savage
had literary skill, and he could personate the manners of a gentleman in days when there were
still gentlemen of fashion who drank, lied, and swaggered into midnight brawls. I have no doubt
whatever that he was the son of the nurse with whom the Countess of Macclesfield had placed
a child that died, and that after his mother's death he found the papers upon which he built
his plot to personate the child, extort money from the Countess and her family, and bring himself
into a profitable notoriety.

Johnson's simple truthfulness and ready sympathy made it hard for him to doubt the story told
as Savage told it to him. But when he told it again himself, though he denounced one whom he
believed to be an unnatural mother, and dealt gently with his friend, he did not translate
evil into good. Through all the generous and kindly narrative we may see clearly that Savage
was an impostor. But Johnson, who made large allowance for temptations pressing on the poor,
himself suffered and overcame the hardest trials, firm always to his duty, true servant of
God and friend of man.

Richard Savage's whole public life was built upon a lie. His base nature foiled any attempt
made to befriend him; and the friends he lost, he slandered; Richard Steele among them. Samuel
Johnson was a friend easy to make, and difficult to lose. There was no money to be got from
him, for he was altogether poor in everything but the large spirit of human kindness. Savage
drew largely on him for sympathy, and had it; although Johnson was too clear-sighted to be
much deceived except in judgment upon the fraudulent claims which then gave rise to division
of opinion. The Life of Savage is a noble piece of truth, although it rests on faith put in
a fraud.

                                     "Jacoboei. The two comic characters of Sir Trusty
and Grideline, though of no great value, are yet such as the poet
intended.

SAVAGE.

It has been observed in all ages that the advantages of nature or of fortune have contributed
very little to the promotion of happiness: and that those whom the splendour of their rank,
or the extent of their capacity, has placed upon the summit of human life, have not often given
any just occasion to envy in those who look up to them from a lower station; whether it be
that apparent superiority incites great designs, and great designs are naturally liable to
fatal miscarriages; or that the general lot of mankind is misery, and the misfortunes of those
whose eminence drew upon them universal attention have been more carefully recorded, because
they were more generally observed, and have in reality been only more conspicuous than those
of others, not more frequent, or more severe.

That affluence and power, advantages extrinsic and adventitious, and therefore easily separable
from those by whom they are possessed, should very often flatter the mind with expectations
of felicity which they cannot give, raises no astonishment: but it seems rational to hope that
intellectual greatness should produce better effects; that minds qualified for great attainments
should first endeavour their own benefit, and that they who are most able to teach others the
way to happiness, should with most certainty follow it themselves. But this expectation, however
plausible, has been very frequently disappointed. The heroes of literary as well as civil history
have been very often no less remarkable for what they have suffered than for what they have
achieved; and volumes have been written only to enumerate the miseries of the learned, and
relate their unhappy lives and untimely deaths.

To these mournful narratives I am about to add the Life of RICHARD SAVAGE, a man whose writings
entitle him to an eminent rank in the classes of learning, and whose misfortunes claim a degree
of compassion not always due to the unhappy, as they were often the consequences of the crimes
of others rather than his own.

In the year 1697, Anne, Countess of Macclesfield, having lived some time upon very uneasy terms
with her husband, thought a public confession of adultery the most obvious and expeditious
method of obtaining her liberty; and therefore declared that the child with which she was then
great, was begotten by the Earl Rivers. This, as may be imagined, made her husband no less
desirous of a separation than herself, and he prosecuted his design in the most effectual manner:
for he applied, not to the ecclesiastical courts for a divorce, but to the Parliament for an
Act by which his marriage might be dissolved, the nuptial contract annulled, and the children
of his wife illegitimated. This Act, after the usual deliberation, he obtained, though without
the approbation of some, who considered marriage as an affair only cognisable by ecclesiastical
judges; and on March 3rd was separated from his wife, whose fortune, which was very great,
was repaid her, and who having, as well as her husband, the liberty of making another choice,
she in a short time married Colonel Brett.

While the Earl of Macclesfield was prosecuting this affair, his wife was, on the 10th of January,
1607-8,[sic] delivered of a son: and the Earl Rivers, by appearing to consider him as his own,
left none any reason to doubt of the sincerity of her declaration; for he was his godfather
and gave him his own name, which was by his direction inserted in the register of St. Andrew's
parish in Holborn, but unfortunately left him to the care of his mother, whom, as she was now
set free from her husband, he probably imagined likely to treat with great tenderness the child
that had contributed to so pleasing an event. It is not indeed easy to discover what motives
could be found to overbalance that natural affection of a parent, or what interest could be
promoted by neglect or cruelty. The dread of shame or of poverty, by which some wretches have
been incited to abandon or murder their children, cannot be supposed to have affected a woman
who had proclaimed her crimes and solicited reproach, and on whom the clemency of the Legislature
had undeservedly bestowed a fortune, which would have been very little diminished by the expenses
which the care of her child could have brought upon her. It was therefore not likely that she
would be wicked without temptation; that she would look upon her son from his birth with a
kind of resentment and abhorrence; and, instead of supporting, assisting, and defending him,
delight to see him struggling with misery, or that she would take every opportunity of aggravating
his misfortunes, and obstructing his resources, and with an implacable and restless cruelty
continue her persecution from the first hour of his life to the last. But whatever were her
motives, no sooner was her son born than she discovered a resolution of disowning him; and
in a very short time removed him from her sight, by committing him to the care of a poor woman,
whom she directed to educate him as her own, and enjoined never to inform him of his true parents.

Such was the beginning of the life of Richard Savage. Born with a legal claim to honour and
to affluence, he was in two months illegitimated by the Parliament, and disowned by his mother,
doomed to poverty and obscurity, and launched upon the ocean of life only that he might be
swallowed by its quicksands, or dashed upon its rocks. His mother could not indeed infect others
with the same cruelty. As it was impossible to avoid the inquiries which the curiosity or tenderness
of her relations made after her child, she was obliged to give some account of the measures
she had taken; and her mother, the Lady Mason, whether in approbation of her design, or to
prevent more criminal contrivances, engaged to transact with the nurse, to pay her for her
care, and to superintend the education of the child. He was, however, not yet wholly abandoned.
The Lady Mason still continued her care, and directed him to be placed at a small grammar school
near St. Albans, where he was called by the name of his nurse, without the least intimation
that he had a claim to any other. Here he was initiated in literature, and passed through several
of the classes, with what rapidity or with what applause cannot now be known. As he always
spoke with respect of his master, it is probable that the mean rank in which he then appeared
did not hinder his genius from being distinguished, or his industry from being rewarded; and
if in so low a state he obtained distinctions and rewards, it is not likely that they were
gained but by genius and industry.

It is very reasonable to conjecture that his application was equal to his abilities, because
his improvement was more than proportioned to the opportunities which he enjoyed; nor can it
be doubted that if his earliest productions had been preserved, like those of happier students,
we might in some have found vigorous sallies of that sprightly humour which distinguishes "The
Author to be Let," and in others strong touches of that imagination which painted the solemn
scenes of "The Wanderer."

While he was thus cultivating his genius, his father, the Earl Rivers, was seized with a distemper,
which in a short time put an end to his life. He had frequently inquired after his son, and
had always been amused with fallacious and evasive answers; but being now in his own opinion
on his death-bed, he thought it his duty to provide for him among his other natural children,
and therefore demanded a positive account of him, with an importunity not to be diverted or
denied. His mother, who could no longer refuse an answer, determined at least to give such
as should cut him off for ever from that happiness which competence affords, and therefore
declared that he was dead; which is perhaps the first instance of a lie invented by a mother
to deprive her son of a provision which was designed him by another, and which she could not
expect herself, though he should lose it. This was therefore an act of wickedness which could
not be defeated, because it could not be suspected; the earl did not imagine that there could
exist in a human form a mother that would ruin her son without enriching herself, and therefore
bestowed upon some other person six thousand pounds which he had in his will bequeathed to Savage.

The same cruelty which incited his mother to intercept this provision which had been intended
him, prompted her in a short time to another project, a project worthy of such a disposition.
She endeavoured to rid herself from the danger of being at any time made known to him, by sending
him secretly to the American Plantations. By whose kindness this scheme was counteracted, or
by whose interposition she was induced to lay aside her design, I know not; it is not improbable
that the Lady Mason might persuade or compel her to desist, or perhaps she could not easily
find accomplices wicked enough to concur in so cruel an action; for it may be conceived that
those who had by a long gradation of guilt hardened their hearts against the sense of common
wickedness, would yet be shocked at the design of a mother to expose her son to slavery and
want, to expose him without interest, and without provocation; and Savage might on this occasion
find protectors and advocates among those who had long traded in crimes, and whom compassion
had never touched before.

Being hindered, by whatever means, from banishing him into another country, she formed soon
after a scheme for burying him in poverty and obscurity in his own; and that his station of
life, if not the place of his residence, might keep him for ever at a distance from her, she
ordered him to be placed with a shoemaker in Holborn, that, after the usual time of trial,
he might become his apprentice.

It is generally reported that this project was for some time successful, and that Savage was
employed at the awl longer than he was willing to confess: nor was it perhaps any great advantage
to him, that an unexpected discovery determined him to quit his occupation.

About this time his nurse, who had always treated him as her own son, died; and it was natural
for him to take care of those effects which by her death were, as he imagined, become his own:
he therefore went to her house, opened her boxes, and examined her papers, among which he found
some letters written to her by the Lady Mason, which informed him of his birth, and the reasons
for which it was concealed. He was no longer satisfied with the employment which had been allotted
him, but thought he had a right to share the affluence of his mother; and therefore without
scruple applied to her as her son, and made use of every art to awaken her tenderness and attract
her regard. But neither his letters, nor the interposition of those friends which his merit
or his distress procured him, made any impression on her mind. She still resolved to neglect,
though she could no longer disown him. It was to no purpose that he frequently solicited her
to admit him to see her; she avoided him with the most vigilant precaution, and ordered him
to be excluded from her house, by whomsoever he might be introduced, and what reason soever
he might give for entering it.

Savage was at the same time so touched with the discovery of his real mother, that it was his
frequent practice to walk in the dark evenings for several hours before her door, in hopes
of seeing her as she might come by accident to the window, or cross her apartment with a candle
in her hand. But all his assiduity and tenderness were without effect, for he could neither
soften her heart nor open her hand, and was reduced to the utmost miseries of want, while he
was endeavouring to awaken the affection of a mother. He was therefore obliged to seek some
other means of support; and, having no profession, became by necessity an author.

At this time the attention of the literary world was engrossed by the Bangorian controversy,
which filled the press with pamphlets, and the coffee-houses with disputants. Of this subject,
as most popular, he made choice for his first attempt, and, without any other knowledge of
the question than he had casually collected from conversation, published a poem against the
bishop. What was the success or merit of this performance I know not; it was probably lost
among the innumerable pamphlets to which that dispute gave occasion. Mr. Savage was himself
in a little time ashamed of it, and endeavoured to suppress it, by destroying all the copies
that he could collect. He then attempted a more gainful kind of writing, and in his eighteenth
year offered to the stage a comedy borrowed from a Spanish plot, which was refused by the players,
and was therefore given by him to Mr. Bullock, who, having more interest, made some slight
alterations, and brought it upon the stage, under the title of Woman's a Riddle, but allowed
the unhappy author no part of the profit.

Not discouraged, however, at his repulse, he wrote two years afterwards Love in a Veil, another
comedy, borrowed likewise from the Spanish, but with little better success than before; for
though it was received and acted, yet it appeared so late in the year, that the author obtained
no other advantage from it than the acquaintance of Sir Richard Steele and Mr. Wilks, by whom
he was pitied, caressed, and relieved.

Sir Richard Steele, having declared in his favour with all the ardour of benevolence which
constituted his character, promoted his interest with the utmost zeal, related his misfortunes,
applauded his merit, took all the opportunities of recommending him, and asserted that "the
inhumanity of his mother had given him a right to find every good man his father." Nor was
Mr. Savage admitted to his acquaintance only, but to his confidence, of which he sometimes
related an instance too extraordinary to be omitted, as it affords a very just idea of his
patron's character. He was once desired by Sir Richard, with an air of the utmost importance,
to come very early to his house the next morning. Mr. Savage came as he had promised, found
the chariot at the door, and Sir Richard waiting for him, and ready to go out. What was intended,
and whither they were to go, Savage could not conjecture, and was not willing to inquire; but
immediately seated himself with Sir Richard. The coachman was ordered to drive, and they hurried
with the utmost expedition to Hyde Park Corner, where they stopped at a petty tavern, and retired
to a private room. Sir Richard then informed him that he intended to publish a pamphlet, and
that he had desired him to come thither that he might write for him. He soon sat down to the
work. Sir Richard dictated, and Savage wrote, till the dinner that had been ordered was put
upon the table. Savage was surprised at the meanness of the entertainment, and after some hesitation
ventured to ask for wine, which Sir Richard, not without reluctance, ordered to be brought.
They then finished their dinner, and proceeded in their pamphlet, which they concluded in the
afternoon.

Mr. Savage then imagined his task over, and expected that Sir Richard would call for the reckoning,
and return home; but his expectations deceived him, for Sir Richard told him that he was without
money, and that the pamphlet must be sold before the dinner could be paid for; and Savage was
therefore obliged to go and offer their new production to sale for two guineas, which with
some difficulty he obtained. Sir Richard then returned home, having retired that day only to
avoid his creditors, and composed the pamphlet only to discharge his reckoning.

Mr. Savage related another fact equally uncommon, which, though it has no relation to his life,
ought to be preserved. Sir Richard Steele having one day invited to his house a great number
of persons of the first quality, they were surprised at the number of liveries which surrounded
the table; and after dinner, when wine and mirth had set them free from the observation of
a rigid ceremony, one of them inquired of Sir Richard how such an expensive train of domestics
could be consistent with his fortune. Sir Richard very frankly confessed that they were fellows
of whom he would very willingly be rid. And being then asked why he did not discharge them,
declared that they were bailiffs, who had introduced themselves with an execution, and whom,
since he could not send them away, he had thought it convenient to embellish with liveries,
that they might do him credit while they stayed. His friends were diverted with the expedient,
and by paying the debt, discharged their attendance, having obliged Sir Richard to promise
that they should never again find him graced with a retinue of the same kind.

Under such a tutor, Mr. Savage was not likely to learn prudence or frugality; and perhaps many
of the misfortunes which the want of those virtues brought upon him in the following parts
of his life, might be justly imputed to so unimproving an example. Nor did the kindness of
Sir Richard end in common favours. He proposed to have established him in some settled scheme
of life, and to have contracted a kind of alliance with him, by marrying him to a natural daughter,
on whom he intended to bestow a thousand pounds. But though he was always lavish of future
bounties, he conducted his affairs in such a manner that he was very seldom able to keep his
promises, or execute his own intentions; and, as he was never able to raise the sum which he
had offered, the marriage was delayed. In the meantime he was officiously informed that Mr.
Savage had ridiculed him; by which he was so much exasperated that he withdrew the allowance
which he had paid him, and never afterwards admitted him to his house.

It is not, indeed, unlikely that Savage might by his imprudence expose himself to the malice
of a talebearer; for his patron had many follies, which, as his discernment easily discovered,
his imagination might sometimes incite him to mention too ludicrously. A little knowledge of
the world is sufficient to discover that such weakness is very common, and that there are few
who do not sometimes, in the wantonness of thoughtless mirth, or the heat of transient resentment,
speak of their friends and benefactors with levity and contempt, though in their cooler moments
they want neither sense of their kindness nor reverence for their virtue; the fault, therefore,
of Mr. Savage was rather negligence than ingratitude. But Sir Richard must likewise be acquitted
of severity, for who is there that can patiently bear contempt from one whom he has relieved
and supported, whose establishment he has laboured, and whose interest he has promoted?

As Mr. Wilks was one of those to whom calamity seldom complained without relief, he naturally
took an unfortunate wit into his protection, and not only assisted him in any casual distresses,
but continued an equal and steady kindness to the time of his death. By this interposition
Mr. Savage once obtained from his mother fifty pounds, and a promise of one hundred and fifty
more; but it was the fate of this unhappy man that few promises of any advantage to him were
performed. His mother was infected, among others, with the general madness of the South Sea
traffic; and having been disappointed in her expectations, refused to pay what perhaps nothing
but the prospect of sudden affluence prompted her to promise.

Being thus obliged to depend upon the friendship of Mr. Wilks, he was consequently an assiduous
frequenter of the theatres: and in a short time the amusements of the stage took such possession
of his mind that he never was absent from a play in several years. This constant attendance
naturally procured him the acquaintance of the players, and, among others, of Mrs. Oldfield,
who was so much pleased with his conversation, and touched with his misfortunes, that she allowed
him a settled pension of fifty pounds a year, which was during her life regularly paid. That
this act of generosity may receive its due praise, and that the good actions of Mrs. Oldfield
may not be sullied by her general character, it is proper to mention that Mr. Savage often
declared, in the strongest terms, that he never saw her alone, or in any other place than behind
the scenes.

At her death he endeavoured to show his gratitude in the most decent manner, by wearing mourning
as for a mother; but did not celebrate her in elegies, because he knew that too great a profusion
of praise would only have revived those faults which his natural equity did not allow him to
think less because they were committed by one who favoured him; but of which, though his virtue
would not endeavour to palliate them, his gratitude would not suffer him to prolong the memory
or diffuse the censure.

In his "Wanderer" he has indeed taken an opportunity of mentioning her; but celebrates her
not for her virtue, but her beauty, an excellence which none ever denied her: this is the only
encomium with which he has rewarded her liberality, and perhaps he has even in this been too
lavish of his praise. He seems to have thought that never to mention his benefactress would
have an appearance of ingratitude, though to have dedicated any particular performance to her
memory would have only betrayed an officious partiality, and that without exalting her character
would have depressed his own. He had sometimes, by the kindness of Mr. Wilks, the advantage
of a benefit, on which occasions he often received uncommon marks of regard and compassion;
and was once told by the Duke of Dorset that it was just to consider him as an injured nobleman,
and that in his opinion the nobility ought to think themselves obliged, without solicitation,
to take every opportunity of supporting him by their countenance and patronage. But he had
generally the mortification to hear that the whole interest of his mother was employed to frustrate
his applications, and that she never left any expedient untried by which he might be cut off
from the possibility of supporting life. The same disposition she endeavoured to diffuse among
all those over whom nature or fortune gave her any influence, and indeed succeeded too well
in her design; but could not always propagate her effrontery with her cruelty; for some of
those whom she incited against him were ashamed of their own conduct, and boasted of that relief
which they never gave him. In this censure I do not indiscriminately involve all his relations;
for he has mentioned with gratitude the humanity of one lady, whose name I am now unable to
recollect, and to whom, therefore, I cannot pay the praises which she deserves for having acted
well in opposition to influence, precept, and example.

The punishment which our laws inflict upon those parents who murder their infants is well known,
nor has its justice ever been contested; but, if they deserve death who destroy a child in
its birth, what pain can be severe enough for her who forbears to destroy him only to inflict
sharper miseries upon him; who prolongs his life only to make him miserable; and who exposes
him, without care and without pity, to the malice of oppression, the caprices of chance, and
the temptations of poverty; who rejoices to see him overwhelmed with calamities; and, when
his own industry, or the charity of others, has enabled him to rise for a short time above
his miseries, plunges him again into his former distress?

The kindness of his friends not affording him any constant supply, and the prospect of improving
his fortune by enlarging his acquaintance necessarily leading him to places of expense, he
found it necessary to endeavour once more at dramatic poetry; for which he was now better qualified
by a more extensive knowledge and longer observation. But having been unsuccessful in comedy,
though rather for want of opportunities than genius, he resolved to try whether he should not
be more fortunate in exhibiting a tragedy. The story which he chose for the subject was that
of Sir Thomas Overbury, a story well adapted to the stage, though perhaps not far enough removed
from the present age to admit properly the fictions necessary to complete the plan; for the
mind, which naturally loves truth, is always most offended with the violation of those truths
of which we are most certain; and we of course conceive those facts most certain which approach
nearer to our own time. Out of this story he formed a tragedy, which, if the circumstances
in which he wrote it be considered, will afford at once an uncommon proof of strength of genius
and evenness of mind, of a serenity not to be ruffled and an imagination not to be suppressed.

If the performance of a writer thus distressed is not perfect, its faults ought surely to be
imputed to a cause very different from want of genius, and must rather excite pity than provoke
censure. He had, indeed, in Mr. Hill another critic of a very different class, from whose friendship
he received great assistance on many occasions, and whom he never mentioned but with the utmost
tenderness and regard. He had been for some time distinguished by him with very particular
kindness, and on this occasion it was natural to apply to him as an author of an established
character. He therefore sent this tragedy to him, with a short copy of verses, in which he
desired his correction. Mr. Hill, whose humanity and politeness are generally known, readily
complied with his request; but as he is remarkable for singularity of sentiment, and bold experiments
in language, Mr. Savage did not think this play much improved by his innovation, and had even
at that time the courage to reject several passages which he could not approve; and, what is
still more laudable, Mr. Hill had the generosity not to resent the neglect of his alterations,
but wrote the prologue and epilogue, in which he touches on the circumstances of the author
with great tenderness.

After all these obstructions and compliances, he was only able to bring his play upon the stage
in the summer, when the chief actors had retired, and the rest were in possession of the house
for their own advantage.

In the publication of his performance he was more successful, for the rays of genius that glimmered
in it, that glimmered through all the mists which poverty and Cibber had been able to spread
over it, procured him the notice and esteem of many persons eminent for their rank, their virtue,
and their wit. Of this play, acted, printed, and dedicated, the accumulated profits arose to
a hundred pounds, which he thought at that time a very large sum, having been never master
of so much before.

In the dedication, for which he received ten guineas, there is nothing remarkable. The preface
contains a very liberal encomium on the blooming excellence of Mr. Theophilus Cibber, which
Mr. Savage could not in the latter part of his life see his friends about to read without snatching
the play out of their hands. The generosity of Mr. Hill did not end on this occasion; for afterwards,
when Mr. Savage's necessities returned, he encouraged a subscription to a Miscellany of Poems
in a very extraordinary manner, by publishing his story in the Plain Dealer, with some affecting
lines, which he asserts to have been written by Mr. Savage upon the treatment received by him
from his mother, but of which he was himself the author, as Mr. Savage afterwards declared.
These lines, and the paper in which they were inserted, had a very powerful effect upon all
but his mother, whom, by making her cruelty more public, they only hardened in her aversion.

Mr. Hill not only promoted the subscription to the Miscellany, but furnished likewise the greatest
part of the poems of which it is composed, and particularly "The Happy Man," which he published
as a specimen.

The subscriptions of those whom these papers should influence to patronise merit in distress,
without any other solicitation, were directed to be left at Button's Coffee-house; and Mr.
Savage going thither a few days afterwards, without expectation of any effect from his proposal,
found, to his surprise, seventy guineas, which had been sent him in consequence of the compassion
excited by Mr. Hill's pathetic representation.

To this Miscellany he wrote a preface, in which he gives an account of his mother's cruelty
in a very uncommon strain of humour, and with a gaiety of imagination which the success of
his subscription probably produced. The dedication is addressed to the Lady Mary Wortley Montagu,
whom he flatters without reserve, and, to confess the truth, with very little art. The same
observation may be extended to all his dedications: his compliments are constrained and violent,
heaped together without the grace of order, or the decency of introduction. He seems to have
written his panegyrics for the perusal only of his patrons, and to imagine that he had no other
task than to pamper them with praises, however gross, and that flattery would make its way
to the heart, without the assistance of elegance or invention.

Soon afterwards the death of the king furnished a general subject for a poetical contest, in
which Mr. Savage engaged, and is allowed to have carried the prize of honour from his competitors:
but I know not whether he gained by his performance any other advantage than the increase of
his reputation, though it must certainly have been with farther views that he prevailed upon
himself to attempt a species of writing, of which all the topics had been long before exhausted,
and which was made at once difficult by the multitudes that had failed in it, and those that
had succeeded.

He was now advancing in reputation, and though frequently involved in very distressful perplexities,
appeared, however, to be gaining upon mankind, when both his fame and his life were endangered
by an event, of which it is not yet determined whether it ought to be mentioned as a crime
or a calamity.

On the 20th of November, 1727, Mr. Savage came from Richmond, where he then lodged that he
might pursue his studies with less interruption, with an intent to discharge another lodging
which he had in Westminster; and accidentally meeting two gentlemen, his acquaintances, whose
names were Merchant and Gregory, he went in with them to a neighbouring coffee-house, and sat
drinking till it was late, it being in no time of Mr. Savage's life any part of his character
to be the first of the company that desired to separate. He would willingly have gone to bed
in the same house, but there was not room for the whole company, and therefore they agreed
to ramble about the streets, and divert themselves with such amusements as should offer themselves
till morning. In this walk they happened unluckily to discover a light in Robinson's Coffee-house,
near Charing Cross, and therefore went in. Merchant with some rudeness demanded a room, and
was told that there was a good fire in the next parlour, which the company were about to leave,
being then paying their reckoning. Merchant, not satisfied with this answer, rushed into the
room, and was followed by his companions. He then petulantly placed himself between the company
and the fire, and soon after kicked down the table. This produced a quarrel, swords were drawn
on both sides, and one Mr. James Sinclair was killed. Savage, having likewise wounded a maid
that held him, forced his way, with Merchant, out of the house; but being intimidated and confused,
without resolution either to fly or stay, they were taken in a back court by one of the company,
and some soldiers, whom he had called to his assistance. Being secured and guarded that night,
they were in the morning carried before three justices, who committed them to the Gatehouse,
from whence, upon the death of Mr. Sinclair, which happened the same day, they were removed
in the night to Newgate, where they were, however, treated with some distinction, exempted
from the ignominy of chains, and confined, not among the common criminals, but in the Press yard.

When the day of trial came, the court was crowded in a very unusual manner, and the public
appeared to interest itself as in a cause of general concern. The witnesses against Mr. Savage
and his friends were, the woman who kept the house, which was a house of ill-fame, and her
maid, the men who were in the room with Mr. Sinclair, and a woman of the town, who had been
drinking with them, and with whom one of them had been seen. They swore in general, that Merchant
gave the provocation, which Savage and Gregory drew their swords to justify; that Savage drew
first, and that he stabbed Sinclair when he was not in a posture of defence, or while Gregory
commanded his sword; that after he had given the thrust he turned pale, and would have retired,
but the maid clung round him, and one of the company endeavoured to detain him, from whom he
broke by cutting the maid on the head, but was afterwards taken in a court. There was some
difference in their depositions; one did not see Savage give the wound, another saw it given
when Sinclair held his point towards the ground; and the woman of the town asserted that she
did not see Sinclair's sword at all. This difference, however, was very far from amounting
to inconsistency; but it was sufficient to show, that the hurry of the dispute was such that
it was not easy to discover the truth with relation to particular circumstances, and that therefore
some deductions were to be made from the credibility of the testimonies.

Sinclair had declared several times before his death that he received his wound from Savage:
nor did Savage at his trial deny the fact, but endeavoured partly to extenuate it, by urging
the suddenness of the whole action, and the impossibility of any ill design or premeditated
malice; and partly to justify it by the necessity of self-defence, and the hazard of his own
life, if he had lost that opportunity of giving the thrust: he observed, that neither reason
nor law obliged a man to wait for the blow which was threatened, and which, if he should suffer
it, he might never be able to return; that it was allowable to prevent an assault, and to preserve
life by taking away that of the adversary by whom it was endangered. With regard to the violence
with which he endeavoured to escape, he declared that it was not his design to fly from justice,
or decline a trial, but to avoid the expenses and severities of a prison; and that he intended
to appear at the bar without compulsion.

This defence, which took up more than an hour, was heard by the multitude that thronged the
court with the most attentive and respectful silence. Those who thought he ought not to be
acquitted owned that applause could not be refused him; and those who before pitied his misfortunes
now reverenced his abilities. The witnesses which appeared against him were proved to be persons
of characters which did not entitle them to much credit; a common strumpet, a woman by whom
strumpets were entertained, a man by whom they were supported: and the character of Savage
was by several persons of distinction asserted to be that of a modest, inoffensive man, not
inclined to broils or to insolence, and who had, to that time, been only known for his misfortunes
and his wit. Had his audience been his judges, he had undoubtedly been acquitted, but Mr. Page,
who was then upon the bench, treated him with his usual insolence and severity, and when he
had summed up the evidence, endeavoured to exasperate the jury, as Mr. Savage used to relate
it, with this eloquent harangue:--

"Gentlemen of the jury, you are to consider that Mr. Savage is a very great man, a much greater
man than you or I, gentlemen of the jury; that he wears very fine clothes, much finer clothes
than you or I, gentlemen of the jury; that he has abundance of money in his pockets, much more
money than you or I, gentlemen of the jury; but, gentlemen of the jury, is it not a very hard
case, gentlemen of the jury, that Mr. Savage should therefore kill you or me, gentlemen of
the jury?"

Mr. Savage, hearing his defence thus misrepresented, and the men who were to decide his fate
incited against him by invidious comparisons, resolutely asserted that his cause was not candidly
explained, and began to recapitulate what he had before said with regard to his condition,
and the necessity of endeavouring to escape the expenses of imprisonment; but the judge having
ordered him to be silent, and repeated his orders without effect, commanded that he should
be taken from the bar by force.

The jury then heard the opinion of the judge, that good characters were of no weight against
positive evidence, though they might turn the scale where it was doubtful; and that though,
when two men attack each other, the death of either is only manslaughter; but where one is
the aggressor, as in the case before them, and, in pursuance of his first attack, kills the
other, the law supposes the action, however sudden, to be malicious. They then deliberated
upon their verdict, and determined that Mr. Savage and Mr. Gregory were guilty of murder, and
Mr. Merchant, who had no sword, only of manslaughter.

Thus ended this memorable trial, which lasted eight hours. Mr. Savage and Mr. Gregory were
conducted back to prison, where they were more closely confined, and loaded with irons of fifty
pounds' weight. Four days afterwards they were sent back to the court to receive sentence,
on which occasion Mr. Savage made, as far as it could be retained in memory, the following
speech:--

"It is now, my lord, too late to offer anything by way of defence or vindication; nor can we
expect from your lordships, in this court, but the sentence which the law requires you, as
judges, to pronounce against men of our calamitous condition. But we are also persuaded that
as mere men, and out of this seat of rigorous justice, you are susceptive of the tender passions,
and too humane not to commiserate the unhappy situation of those whom the law sometimes perhaps
exacts from you to pronounce upon. No doubt you distinguish between offences which arise out
of premeditation, and a disposition habituated to vice or immorality, and transgressions which
are the unhappy and unforeseen effects of casual absence of reason, and sudden impulse of passion.
We therefore hope you will contribute all you can to an extension of that mercy which the gentlemen
of the jury have been pleased to show to Mr. Merchant, who (allowing facts as sworn against
us by the evidence) has led us into this our calamity. I hope this will not be construed as
if we meant to reflect upon that gentleman, or remove anything from us upon him, or that we
repine the more at our fate because he has no participation of it. No, my Lord! For my part,
I declare nothing could more soften my grief than to be without any companion in so great a
misfortune."

As he was very far from approving the conduct of Sir Robert Walpole, and in conversation mentioned
him sometimes with acrimony, and generally with contempt, as he was one of those who were always
zealous in their assertions of the justice of the late opposition, jealous of the rights of
the people, and alarmed by the long-continued triumph of the Court, it was natural to ask him
what could induce him to employ his poetry in praise of that man who was, in his opinion, an
enemy to liberty, and an oppressor of his country? He alleged that he was then dependent upon
the Lord Tyrconnel, who was an implicit follower of the ministry: and that, being enjoined
by him, not without menaces, to write in praise of the leader, he had not resolution sufficient
to sacrifice the pleasure of affluence to that of integrity.

On this, and on many other occasions, he was ready to lament the misery of living at the tables
of other men, which was his fate from the beginning to the end of his life; for I know not
whether he ever had, for three months together, a settled habitation, in which he could claim
a right of residence.

To this unhappy state it is just to impute much of the inconsistency of his conduct, for though
a readiness to comply with the inclinations of others was no part of his natural character,
yet he was sometimes obliged to relax his obstinacy, and submit his own judgment, and even
his virtue, to the government of those by whom he was supported. So that if his miseries were
sometimes the consequences of his faults, he ought not yet to be wholly excluded from compassion,
because his faults were very often the effects of his misfortunes.

In this gay period of his life, while he was surrounded by affluence and pleasure, he published
"The Wanderer," a moral poem, of which the design is comprised in these lines:--

     "I fly all public care, all venal strife,
      To try the still, compared with active, life;
      To prove, by these, the sons of men may owe
      The fruits of bliss to bursting clouds of woe;
      That ev'n calamity, by thought refined,
      Inspirits and adorns the thinking mind."

And more distinctly in the following passage:--

     "By woe, the soul to daring action swells;
      By woe, in plaintless patience it excels:
      From patience prudent, clear experience springs,
      And traces knowledge through the course of things.
      Thence hope is formed, thence fortitude, success,
      Renown--whate'er men covet and caress."

This performance was always considered by himself as his masterpiece; and Mr. Pope, when he
asked his opinion of it, told him that he read it once over, and was not displeased with it;
that it gave him more pleasure at the second perusal, and delighted him still more at the third.

It has been generally objected to "The Wanderer," that the disposition of the parts is irregular;
that the design is obscure, and the plan perplexed; that the images, however beautiful, succeed
each other without order; and that the whole performance is not so much a regular fabric, as
a heap of shining materials thrown together by accident, which strikes rather with the solemn
magnificence of a stupendous ruin than the elegant grandeur of a finished pile. This criticism
is universal, and therefore it is reasonable to believe it at least in a degree just; but Mr.
Savage was always of a contrary opinion, and thought his drift could only be missed by negligence
or stupidity, and that the whole plan was regular, and the parts distinct. It was never denied
to abound with strong representations of nature, and just observations upon life; and it may
easily be observed that most of his pictures have an evident tendency to illustrate his first
great position, "that good is the consequence of evil." The sun that burns up the mountains
fructifies the vales; the deluge that rushes down the broken rocks with dreadful impetuosity
is separated into purling brooks; and the rage of the hurricane purifies the air.

Even in this poem he has not been able to forbear one touch upon the cruelty of his mother,
which, though remarkably delicate and tender, is a proof how deep an impression it had upon
his mind. This must be at least acknowledged, which ought to be thought equivalent to many
other excellences, that this poem can promote no other purposes than those of virtue, and that
it is written with a very strong sense of the efficacy of religion. But my province is rather
to give the history of Mr. Savage's performances than to display their beauties, or to obviate
the criticisms which they have occasioned, and therefore I shall not dwell upon the particular
passages which deserve applause. I shall neither show the excellence of his descriptions, nor
expatiate on the terrific portrait of suicide, nor point out the artful touches by which he
has distinguished the intellectual features of the rebels, who suffer death in his last canto.
It is, however, proper to observe, that Mr. Savage always declared the characters wholly fictitious,
and without the least allusion to any real persons or actions.

A superstitious regard to the correction of his sheets was one of Mr. Savage's peculiarities:
he often altered, revised, recurred to his first reading or punctuation, and again adopted
the alteration; he was dubious and irresolute without end, as on a question of the last importance,
and at last was seldom satisfied. The intrusion or omission of a comma was sufficient to discompose
him, and he would lament an error of a single letter as a heavy calamity. In one of his letters
relating to an impression of some verses he remarks that he had, with regard to the correction
of the proof, "a spell upon him;" and indeed the anxiety with which he dwelt upon the minutest
and most trifling niceties, deserved no other name than that of fascination. That he sold so
valuable a performance for so small a price was not to be imputed either to necessity, by which
the learned and ingenious are often obliged to submit to very hard conditions, or to avarice,
by which the booksellers are frequently incited to oppress that genius by which they are supported,
but to that intemperate desire of pleasure, and habitual slavery to his passions, which involved
him in many perplexities. He happened at that time to be engaged in the pursuit of some trifling
gratification, and, being without money for the present occasion, sold his poem to the first
bidder, and perhaps for the first price that was proposed, and would probably have been content
with less if less had been offered him.

This poem was addressed to the Lord Tyrconnel, not only in the first lines, but in a formal
dedication filled with the highest strains of panegyric, and the warmest professions of gratitude,
but by no means remarkable for delicacy of connection or elegance of style. These praises in
a short time he found himself inclined to retract, being discarded by the man on whom he had
bestowed them, and whom he then immediately discovered not to have deserved them. Of this quarrel,
which every day made more bitter, Lord Tyrconnel and Mr. Savage assigned very different reasons,
which might perhaps all in reality concur, though they were not all convenient to be alleged
by either party. Lord Tyrconnel affirmed that it was the constant practice of Mr. Savage to
enter a tavern with any company that proposed it, drink the most expensive wines with great
profusion, and when the reckoning was demanded to be without money. If, as it often happened,
his company were willing to defray his part, the affair ended without any ill consequences;
but if they were refractory, and expected that the wine should be paid for by him that drank
it, his method of composition was, to take them with him to his own apartment, assume the government
of the house, and order the butler in an imperious manner to set the best wine in the cellar
before his company, who often drank till they forgot the respect due to the house in which
they were entertained, indulged themselves in the utmost extravagance of merriment, practised
the most licentious frolics, and committed all the outrages of drunkenness. Nor was this the
only charge which Lord Tyrconnel brought against him. Having given him a collection of valuable
books, stamped with his own arms, he had the mortification to see them in a short time exposed
to sale upon the stalls, it being usual with Mr. Savage, when he wanted a small sum, to take
his books to the pawnbroker.

Whoever was acquainted with Mr. Savage easily credited both these accusations; for having been
obliged, from his first entrance into the world, to subsist upon expedients, affluence was
not able to exalt him above them; and so much was he delighted with wine and conversation,
and so long had he been accustomed to live by chance, that he would at any time go to the tavern
without scruple, and trust for the reckoning to the liberality of his company, and frequently
of company to whom he was very little known. This conduct, indeed, very seldom drew upon him
those inconveniences that might be feared by any other person, for his conversation was so
entertaining, and his address so pleasing, that few thought the pleasure which they received
from him dearly purchased by paying for his wine. It was his peculiar happiness that he scarcely
ever found a stranger whom he did not leave a friend; but it must likewise be added, that he
had not often a friend long without obliging him to become a stranger.

Mr. Savage, on the other hand, declared that Lord Tyrconnel quarrelled with him because he
would not subtract from his own luxury and extravagance what he had promised to allow him,
and that his resentment was only a plea for the violation of his promise. He asserted that
he had done nothing that ought to exclude him from that subsistence which he thought not so
much a favour as a debt, since it was offered him upon conditions which he had never broken:
and that his only fault was, that he could not be supported with nothing. He acknowledged that
Lord Tyrconnel often exhorted him to regulate his method of life, and not to spend all his
nights in taverns, and that he appeared desirous that he would pass those hours with him which
he so freely bestowed upon others. This demand Mr. Savage considered as a censure of his conduct
which he could never patiently bear, and which, in the latter and cooler parts of his life,
was so offensive to him, that he declared it as his resolution "to spurn that friend who should
pretend to dictate to him;" and it is not likely that in his earlier years he received admonitions
with more calmness. He was likewise inclined to resent such expectations, as tending to infringe
his liberty, of which he was very jealous, when it was necessary to the gratification of his
passions; and declared that the request was still more unreasonable as the company to which
he was to have been confined was insupportably disagreeable. This assertion affords another
instance of that inconsistency of his writings with his conversation which was so often to
be observed. He forgot how lavishly he had, in his dedication to "The Wanderer," extolled the
delicacy and penetration, the humanity and generosity, the candour and politeness of the man
whom, when he no longer loved him, he declared to be a wretch without understanding, without
good nature, and without justice; of whose name he thought himself obliged to leave no trace
in any future edition of his writings, and accordingly blotted it out of that copy of "The
Wanderer" which was in his hands.

During his continuance with the Lord Tyrconnel, he wrote "The Triumph of Health and Mirth,"
on the recovery of Lady Tyrconnel from a languishing illness. This performance is remarkable,
not only for the gaiety of the ideas and the melody of the numbers, but for the agreeable fiction
upon which it is formed. Mirth, overwhelmed with sorrow for the sickness of her favourite,
takes a flight in quest of her sister Health, whom she finds reclined upon the brow of a lofty
mountain, amidst the fragrance of perpetual spring, with the breezes of the morning sporting
about her. Being solicited by her sister Mirth, she readily promises her assistance, flies
away in a cloud, and impregnates the waters of Bath with new virtues, by which the sickness
of Belinda is relieved. As the reputation of his abilities, the particular circumstances of
his birth and life, the splendour of his appearance, and the distinction which was for some
time paid him by Lord Tyrconnel, entitled him to familiarity with persons of higher rank than
those to whose conversation he had been before admitted, he did not fail to gratify that curiosity
which induced him to take a nearer view of those whom their birth, their employments, or their
fortunes necessarily placed at a distance from the greatest part of mankind, and to examine
whether their merit was magnified or diminished by the medium through which it was contemplated;
whether the splendour with which they dazzled their admirers was inherent in themselves, or
only reflected on them by the objects that surrounded them; and whether great men were selected
for high stations, or high stations made great men. His discernment was quick, and therefore
he soon found in every person, and in every affair, something that deserved attention; he was
supported by others, without any care for himself, and was therefore at leisure to pursue his
observations. More circumstances to constitute a critic on human life could not easily concur;
nor, indeed, could any man, who assumed from accidental advantages more praise than he could
justly claim from his real merit, admit any acquaintance more dangerous than that of Savage;
of whom likewise it must be confessed, that abilities really exalted above the common level,
or virtue refined from passion, or proof against corruption, could not easily find an abler
judge or a warmer advocate.

What was the result of Mr. Savage's inquiry, though he was not much accustomed to conceal his
discoveries, it may not be entirely safe to relate, because the persons whose characters he
criticised are powerful, and power and resentment are seldom strangers; nor would it perhaps
be wholly just, because what he asserted in conversation might, though true in general, be
heightened by some momentary ardour of imagination, and as it can be delivered only from memory,
may be imperfectly represented, so that the picture, at first aggravated, and then unskilfully
copied, may be justly suspected to retain no great resemblance of the original.

It may, however, be observed, that he did not appear to have formed very elevated ideas of
those to whom the administration of affairs, or the conduct of parties, has been intrusted;
who have been considered as the advocates of the Crown, or the guardians of the people; and
who have obtained the most implicit confidence, and the loudest applauses.

But the opportunity of indulging his speculations on great characters was now at an end. He
was banished from the table of Lord Tyrconnel, and turned again adrift upon the world, without
prospect of finding quickly any other harbour. As prudence was not one of the virtues by which
he was distinguished, he made no provision against a misfortune like this. And though it is
not to be imagined but that the separation must for some time have been preceded by coldness,
peevishness, or neglect, though it was undoubtedly the consequence of accumulated provocations
on both sides, yet every one that knew Savage will readily believe that to him it was sudden
as a stroke of thunder; that, though he might have transiently suspected it, he had never suffered
any thought so unpleasing to sink into his mind, but that he had driven it away by amusements
or dreams of future felicity and affluence, and had never taken any measures by which he might
prevent a precipitation from plenty to indigence. This quarrel and separation, and the difficulties
to which Mr. Savage was exposed by them, were soon known both to his friends and enemies; nor
was it long before he perceived, from the behaviour of both, how much is added to the lustre
of genius by the ornaments of wealth. His condition did not appear to excite much compassion,
for he had not been always careful to use the advantages he enjoyed with that moderation which
ought to have been with more than usual caution preserved by him, who knew, if he had reflected,
that he was only a dependent on the bounty of another, whom he could expect to support him
no longer than he endeavoured to preserve his favour by complying with his inclinations, and
whom he nevertheless set at defiance, and was continually irritating by negligence or encroachments.

Examples need not be sought at any great distance to prove that superiority of fortune has
a natural tendency to kindle pride, and that pride seldom fails to exert itself in contempt
and insult; and if this is often the effect of hereditary wealth, and of honours enjoyed only
by the merits of others, it is some extenuation of any indecent triumphs to which this unhappy
man may have been betrayed, that his prosperity was heightened by the force of novelty, and
made more intoxicating by a sense of the misery in which he had so long languished, and perhaps
of the insults which he had formerly borne, and which he might now think himself entitled to
revenge. It is too common for those who have unjustly suffered pain to inflict it likewise
in their turn with the same injustice, and to imagine that they have a right to treat others
as they have themselves been treated.

That Mr. Savage was too much elevated by any good fortune is generally known; and some passages
of his Introduction to "The Author to be Let" sufficiently show that he did not wholly refrain
from such satire, as he afterwards thought very unjust when he was exposed to it himself; for,
when he was afterwards ridiculed in the character of a distressed poet, he very easily discovered
that distress was not a proper subject for merriment or topic of invective. He was then able
to discern, that if misery be the effect of virtue, it ought to be reverenced; if of ill fortune,
to be pitied; and if of vice, not to be insulted, because it is perhaps itself a punishment
adequate to the crime by which it was produced. And the humanity of that man can deserve no
panegyric who is capable of reproaching a criminal in the hands of the executioner. But these
reflections, though they readily occurred to him in the first and last parts of his life, were,
I am afraid, for a long time forgotten; at least they were, like many other maxims, treasured
up in his mind rather for show than use, and operated very little upon his conduct, however
elegantly he might sometimes explain, or however forcibly he might inculcate them. His degradation,
therefore, from the condition which he had enjoyed with such wanton thoughtlessness, was considered
by many as an occasion of triumph. Those who had before paid their court to him without success
soon returned the contempt which they had suffered; and they who had received favours from
him, for of such favours as he could bestow he was very liberal, did not always remember them.
So much more certain are the effects of resentment than of gratitude. It is not only to many
more pleasing to recollect those faults which place others below them, than those virtues by
which they are themselves comparatively depressed: but it is likewise more easy to neglect
than to recompense. And though there are few who will practise a laborious virtue, there will
never be wanting multitudes that will indulge in easy vice.

Savage, however, was very little disturbed at the marks of contempt which his ill fortune brought
upon him from those whom he never esteemed, and with whom he never considered himself as levelled
by any calamities: and though it was not without some uneasiness that he saw some whose friendship
he valued change their behaviour, he yet observed their coldness without much emotion, considered
them as the slaves of fortune, and the worshippers of prosperity, and was more inclined to
despise them than to lament himself.

It does not appear that after this return of his wants he found mankind equally favourable
to him, as at his first appearance in the world. His story, though in reality not less melancholy,
was less affecting, because it was no longer new. It therefore procured him no new friends,
and those that had formerly relieved him thought they might now consign him to others. He was
now likewise considered by many rather as criminal than as unhappy, for the friends of Lord
Tyrconnel, and of his mother, were sufficiently industrious to publish his weaknesses, which
were indeed very numerous, and nothing was forgotten that might make him either hateful or
ridiculous. It cannot but be imagined that such representations of his faults must make great
numbers less sensible of his distress; many who had only an opportunity to hear one part made
no scruple to propagate the account which they received; many assisted their circulation from
malice or revenge; and perhaps many pretended to credit them, that they might with a better
grace withdraw their regard, or withhold their assistance.

Savage, however, was not one of those who suffered himself to be injured without resistance,
nor was he less diligent in exposing the faults of Lord Tyrconnel, over whom he obtained at
least this advantage, that he drove him first to the practice of outrage and violence; for
he was so much provoked by the wit and virulence of Savage, that he came with a number of attendants,
that did no honour to his courage, to beat him at a coffee-house. But it happened that he had
left the place a few minutes, and his lordship had, without danger, the pleasure of boasting
how he would have treated him. Mr. Savage went next day to repay his visit at his own house,
but was prevailed on by his domestics to retire without insisting on seeing him.

Lord Tyrconnel was accused by Mr. Savage of some actions which scarcely any provocation will
be thought sufficient to justify, such as seizing what he had in his lodgings, and other instances
of wanton cruelty, by which he increased the distress of Savage without any advantage to himself.

These mutual accusations were retorted on both sides, for many years, with the utmost degree
of virulence and rage; and time seemed rather to augment than diminish their resentment. That
the anger of Mr. Savage should be kept alive is not strange, because he felt every day the
consequences of the quarrel; but it might reasonably have been hoped that Lord Tyrconnel might
have relented, and at length have forgot those provocations, which, however they might have
once inflamed him, had not in reality much hurt him. But though this might be some gratification
of his vanity, it afforded very little relief to his necessities, and he was frequently reduced
to uncommon hardships, of which, however, he never made any mean or importunate complaints,
being formed rather to bear misery with fortitude than enjoy prosperity with moderation.

He now thought himself again at liberty to expose the cruelty of his mother; and therefore,
I believe, about this time, published "The Bastard," a poem remarkable for the vivacious sallies
of thought in the beginning, where he makes a pompous enumeration of the imaginary advantages
of base birth, and the pathetic sentiments at the end, where he recounts the real calamities
which he suffered by the crime of his parents. The vigour and spirit of the verses, the peculiar
circumstances of the author, the novelty of the subject, and the notoriety of the story to
which the allusions are made, procured this performance a very favourable reception; great
numbers were immediately dispersed, and editions were multiplied with unusual rapidity.

One circumstance attended the publication which Savage used to relate with great satisfaction.
Thus Savage had the satisfaction of finding that, though he could not reform his mother, he
could punish her, and that he did not always suffer alone.

The pleasure which he received from this increase of his poetical reputation was sufficient
for some time to overbalance the miseries of want, which this performance did not much alleviate;
for it was sold for a very trivial sum to a bookseller, who, though the success was so uncommon
that five impressions were sold, of which many were undoubtedly very numerous, had not generosity
sufficient to admit the unhappy writer to any part of the profit. The sale of this poem was
always mentioned by Mr. Savage with the utmost elevation of heart, and referred to by him as
an incontestable proof of a general acknowledgment of his abilities. It was, indeed, the only
production of which he could justly boast a general reception. But, though he did not lose
the opportunity which success gave him of setting a high rate on his abilities, but paid due
deference to the suffrages of mankind when they were given in his favour, he did not suffer
his esteem of himself to depend upon others, nor found anything sacred in the voice of the
people when they were inclined to censure him; he then readily showed the folly of expecting
that the public should judge right, observed how slowly poetical merit had often forced its
way into the world; he contented himself with the applause of men of judgment, and was somewhat
disposed to exclude all those from the character of men of judgment who did not applaud him.
But he was at other times more favourable to mankind than to think them blind to the beauties
of his works, and imputed the slowness of their sale to other causes; either they were published
at a time when the town was empty, or when the attention of the public was engrossed by some
struggle in the Parliament or some other object of general concern; or they were, by the neglect
of the publisher, not diligently dispersed, or, by his avarice, not advertised with sufficient
frequency. Address, or industry, or liberality was always wanting, and the blame was laid rather
on any person than the author.

By arts like these, arts which every man practises in some degree, and to which too much of
the little tranquillity of life is to be ascribed, Savage was always able to live at peace
with himself. Had he, indeed, only made use of these expedients to alleviate the loss or want
of fortune or reputation, or any other advantages which it is not in a man's power to bestow
upon himself, they might have been justly mentioned as instances of a philosophical mind, and
very properly proposed to the imitation of multitudes who, for want of diverting their imaginations
with the same dexterity, languish under afflictions which might be easily removed.

It were doubtless to be wished that truth and reason were universally prevalent; that everything
were esteemed according to its real value; and that men would secure themselves from being
disappointed, in their endeavours after happiness, by placing it only in virtue, which is always
to be obtained; but, if adventitious and foreign pleasures must be pursued, it would be perhaps
of some benefit, since that pursuit must frequently be fruitless, if the practice of Savage
could be taught, that folly might be an antidote to folly, and one fallacy be obviated by another.
But the danger of this pleasing intoxication must not be concealed; nor, indeed, can any one,
after having observed the life of Savage, need to be cautioned against it. By imputing none
of his miseries to himself, he continued to act upon the same principles, and to follow the
same path; was never made wiser by his sufferings, nor preserved by one misfortune from falling
into another. He proceeded throughout his life to tread the same steps on the same circle;
always applauding his past conduct, or at least forgetting it, to amuse himself with phantoms
of happiness, which were dancing before him; and willingly turned his eyes from the light of
reason, when it would have discovered the illusion, and shown him, what he never wished to
see, his real state. He is even accused, after having lulled his imagination with those ideal
opiates, of having tried the same experiment upon his conscience; and, having accustomed himself
to impute all deviations from the right to foreign causes, it is certain that he was upon every
occasion too easily reconciled to himself, and that he appeared very little to regret those
practices which had impaired his reputation. The reigning error of his life was that he mistook
the love for the practice of virtue, and was indeed not so much a good man as the friend of
goodness.

This, at least, must be allowed him, that he always preserved a strong sense of the dignity,
the beauty, and the necessity of virtue; and that he never contributed deliberately to spread
corruption amongst mankind. His actions, which were generally precipitate, were often blameable;
but his writings, being the production of study, uniformly tended to the exaltation of the
mind and the propagation of morality and piety. These writings may improve mankind when his
failings shall be forgotten; and therefore he must be considered, upon the whole, as a benefactor
to the world. Nor can his personal example do any hurt, since whoever hears of his faults will
hear of the miseries which they brought upon him, and which would deserve less pity had not
his condition been such as made his faults pardonable.

"The Bastard," however it might provoke or mortify his mother, could not be expected to melt
her to compassion, so that he was still under the same want of the necessaries of life; and
he therefore exerted all the interest which his wit, or his birth, or his misfortunes could
procure to obtain, upon the death of Eusden, the place of Poet Laureate, and prosecuted his
application with so much diligence that the king publicly declared it his intention to bestow
it upon him; but such was the fate of Savage that even the king, when he intended his advantage,
was disappointed in his schemes; for the Lord Chamberlain, who has the disposal of the laurel
as one of the appendages of his office, either did not know the king's design, or did not approve
it, or thought the nomination of the Laureate an encroachment upon his rights, and therefore
bestowed the laurel upon Colley Cibber.

Mr. Savage, thus disappointed, took a resolution of applying to the queen, that, having once
given him life, she would enable him to support it, and therefore published a short poem on
her birthday, to which he gave the odd title of "Volunteer Laureate." The event of this essay
he has himself related in the following letter, which he prefixed to the poem when he afterwards
reprinted it in The Gentleman's Magazine, whence I have copied it entire, as this was one of
the few attempts in which Mr. Savage succeeded.

"MR. URBAN,--In your Magazine for February you published the last 'Volunteer Laureate,' written
on a very melancholy occasion, the death of the royal patroness of arts and literature in general,
and of the author of that poem in particular; I now send you the first that Mr. Savage wrote
under that title. This gentleman, notwithstanding a very considerable interest, being, on the
death of Mr. Eusden, disappointed of the Laureate's place, wrote the following verses; which
were no sooner published, but the late queen sent to a bookseller for them. The author had
not at that time a friend either to get him introduced, or his poem presented at Court; yet,
such was the unspeakable goodness of that princess, that, notwithstanding this act of ceremony
was wanting, in a few days after publication Mr. Savage received a bank-bill of fifty pounds,
and a gracious message from her Majesty, by the Lord North and Guilford, to this effect: 'That
her Majesty was highly pleased with the verses; that she took particularly kind his lines there
relating to the king; that he had permission to write annually on the same subject; and that
he should yearly receive the like present, till something better (which was her Majesty's intention)
could be done for him.' After this he was permitted to present one of his annual poems to her
Majesty, had the honour of kissing her hand, and met with the most gracious reception.

"Yours, etc."

Such was the performance, and such its reception; a reception which, though by no means unkind,
was yet not in the highest degree generous. To chain down the genius of a writer to an annual
panegyric showed in the queen too much desire of hearing her own praises, and a greater regard
to herself than to him on whom her bounty was conferred. It was a kind of avaricious generosity,
by which flattery was rather purchased than genius rewarded.

Mrs. Oldfield had formerly given him the same allowance with much more heroic intention: she
had no other view than to enable him to prosecute his studies, and to set himself above the
want of assistance, and was contented with doing good without stipulating for encomiums.

Mr. Savage, however, was not at liberty to make exceptions, but was ravished with the favours
which he had received, and probably yet more with those which he was promised: he considered
himself now as a favourite of the queen, and did not doubt but a few annual poems would establish
him in some profitable employment. He therefore assumed the title of "Volunteer Laureate,"
not without some reprehensions from Cibber, who informed him that the title of "Laureate" was
a mark of honour conferred by the king, from whom all honour is derived, and which, therefore,
no man has a right to bestow upon himself; and added that he might with equal propriety style
himself a Volunteer Lord or Volunteer Baronet. It cannot be denied that the remark was just;
but Savage did not think any title which was conferred upon Mr. Cibber so honourable as that
the usurpation of it could be imputed to him as an instance of very exorbitant vanity, and
therefore continued to write under the same title, and received every year the same reward.
He did not appear to consider these encomiums as tests of his abilities, or as anything more
than annual hints to the queen of her promise, or acts of ceremony, by the performance of which
he was entitled to his pension, and therefore did not labour them with great diligence, or
print more than fifty each year, except that for some of the last years he regularly inserted
them in The Gentleman's Magazine, by which they were dispersed over the kingdom.

Of some of them he had himself so low an opinion that he intended to omit them in the collection
of poems for which he printed proposals, and solicited subscriptions; nor can it seem strange
that, being confined to the same subject, he should be at some times indolent and at others
unsuccessful; that he should sometimes delay a disagreeable task till it was too late to perform
it well; or that he should sometimes repeat the same sentiment on the same occasion, or at
others be misled by an attempt after novelty to forced conceptions and far-fetched images.
He wrote indeed with a double intention, which supplied him with some variety; for his business
was to praise the queen for the favours which he had received, and to complain to her of the
delay of those which she had promised: in some of his pieces, therefore, gratitude is predominant,
and in some discontent; in some, he represents himself as happy in her patronage; and, in others,
as disconsolate to find himself neglected. Her promise, like other promises made to this unfortunate
man, was never performed, though he took sufficient care that it should not be forgotten. The
publication of his "Volunteer Laureate" procured him no other reward than a regular remittance
of fifty pounds. He was not so depressed by his disappointments as to neglect any opportunity
that was offered of advancing his interest. When the Princess Anne was married, he wrote a
poem upon her departure, only, as he declared, "because it was expected from him," and he was
not willing to bar his own prospects by any appearance of neglect. He never mentioned any advantage
gained by this poem, or any regard that was paid to it; and therefore it is likely that it
was considered at Court as an act of duty, to which he was obliged by his dependence, and which
it was therefore not necessary to reward by any new favour: or perhaps the queen really intended
his advancement, and therefore thought it superfluous to lavish presents upon a man whom she
intended to establish for life.

About this time not only his hopes were in danger of being frustrated, but his pension likewise
of being obstructed, by an accidental calumny. The writer of The Daily Courant, a paper then
published under the direction of the Ministry, charged him with a crime, which, though very
great in itself, would have been remarkably invidious in him, and might very justly have incensed
the queen against him. He was accused by name of influencing elections against the Court by
appearing at the head of a Tory mob; nor did the accuser fail to aggravate his crime by representing
it as the effect of the most atrocious ingratitude, and a kind of rebellion against the queen,
who had first preserved him from an infamous death, and afterwards distinguished him by her
favour, and supported him by her charity. The charge, as it was open and confident, was likewise
by good fortune very particular. The place of the transaction was mentioned, and the whole
series of the rioter's conduct related. This exactness made Mr. Savage's vindication easy;
for he never had in his life seen the place which was declared to be the scene of his wickedness,
nor ever had been present in any town when its representatives were chosen. This answer he
therefore made haste to publish, with all the circumstances necessary to make it credible;
and very reasonably demanded that the accusation should be retracted in the same paper, that
he might no longer suffer the imputation of sedition and ingratitude. This demand was likewise
pressed by him in a private letter to the author of the paper, who, either trusting to the
protection of those whose defence he had undertaken, or having entertained some personal malice
against Mr. Savage, or fearing lest, by retracting so confident an assertion, he should impair
the credit of his paper, refused to give him that satisfaction. Mr. Savage therefore thought
it necessary, to his own vindication, to prosecute him in the King's Bench; but as he did not
find any ill effects from the accusation, having sufficiently cleared his innocence, he thought
any further procedure would have the appearance of revenge; and therefore willingly dropped
it. He saw soon afterwards a process commenced in the same court against himself, on an information
in which he was accused of writing and publishing an obscene pamphlet.

It was always Mr Savage's desire to be distinguished; and, when any controversy became popular,
he never wanted some reason for engaging in it with great ardour, and appearing at the head
of the party which he had chosen. As he was never celebrated for his prudence, he had no sooner
taken his side, and informed himself of the chief topics of the dispute, than he took all opportunities
of asserting and propagating his principles, without much regard to his own interest, or any
other visible design than that of drawing upon himself the attention of mankind.

The dispute between the Bishop of London and the chancellor is well known to have been for
some time the chief topic of political conversation; and therefore Mr. Savage, in pursuance
of his character, endeavoured to become conspicuous among the controvertists with which every
coffee-house was filled on that occasion. He was an indefatigable opposer of all the claims
of ecclesiastical power, though he did not know on what they were founded; and was therefore
no friend to the Bishop of London. But he had another reason for appearing as a warm advocate
for Dr. Rundle; for he was the friend of Mr. Foster and Mr. Thomson, who were the friends of
Mr. Savage.

Thus remote was his interest in the question, which, however, as he imagined, concerned him
so nearly, that it was not sufficient to harangue and dispute, but necessary likewise to write
upon it. He therefore engaged with great ardour in a new poem, called by him, "The Progress
of a Divine;" in which he conducts a profligate priest, by all the gradations of wickedness,
from a poor curacy in the country to the highest preferments of the Church; and describes,
with that humour which was natural to him, and that knowledge which was extended to all the
diversities of human life, his behaviour in every station; and insinuates that this priest,
thus accomplished, found at last a patron in the Bishop of London. A Chessman over the is a Vessel

water that was the there be even it may, and see that there was the
assertions to-- instrumentality of interposition.
 This promise was
made with an uncommon declaration, "that it was not the promise of a minister to a petitioner,
but of a friend to his friend."

Mr. Savage now concluded himself set at ease for ever, and, as he observes in a poem written
on that incident of his life, trusted, and was trusted; but soon found that his confidence
was ill-grounded, and this friendly promise was not inviolable. He spent a long time in solicitations,
and at last despaired and desisted. He did not indeed deny that he had given the minister some
reason to believe that he should not strengthen his own interest by advancing him, for he had
taken care to distinguish himself in coffee-houses, as an advocate for the ministry of the
last years of Queen Anne, and was always ready to justify the conduct, and exalt the character,
of Lord Bolingbroke, whom he mentions with great regard in an Epistle upon Authors, which he
wrote about that time, but was too wise to publish, and of which only some fragments have appeared,
inserted by him in the Magazine after his retirement.

To despair was not, however, the character of Savage; when one patronage failed, he had recourse
to another. The Prince was now extremely popular, and had very liberally rewarded the merit
of some writers whom Mr. Savage did not think superior to himself, and therefore he resolved
to address a poem to him. For this purpose he made choice of a subject which could regard only
persons of the highest rank and greatest affluence, and which was therefore proper for a poem
intended to procure the patronage of a prince; and having retired for some time to Richmond,
that he might prosecute his design in full tranquillity, without the temptations of pleasure,
or the solicitations of creditors, by which his meditations were in equal danger of being disconcerted,
he produced a poem "On Public Spirit, with regard to Public Works."

The plan of this poem is very extensive, and comprises a multitude of topics, each of which
might furnish matter sufficient for a long performance, and of which some have already employed
more eminent writers; but as he was perhaps not fully acquainted with the whole extent of his
own design, and was writing to obtain a supply of wants too pressing to admit of long or accurate
inquiries, he passes negligently over many public works which, even in his own opinion, deserved
to be more elaborately treated.

But though he may sometimes disappoint his reader by transient touches upon these subjects,
which have often been considered, and therefore naturally raise expectations, he must be allowed
amply to compensate his omissions by expatiating, in the conclusion of his work, upon a kind
of beneficence not yet celebrated by any eminent poet, though it now appears more susceptible
of embellishments, more adapted to exalt the ideas and affect the passions, than many of those
which have hitherto been thought most worthy of the ornament of verse. The settlement of colonies
in uninhabited countries, the establishment of those in security whose misfortunes have made
their own country no longer pleasing or safe, the acquisition of property without injury to
any, the appropriation of the waste and luxuriant bounties of nature, and the enjoyment of
those gifts which Heaven has scattered upon regions uncultivated and unoccupied, cannot be
considered without giving rise to a great number of pleasing ideas, and bewildering the imagination
in delightful prospects; and therefore, whatever speculations they may produce in those who
have confined themselves to political studies, naturally fixed the attention, and excited the
applause, of a poet. But the poet is employed in a more pleasing undertaking than that of proposing
laws which, however just or expedient, will never be made; or endeavouring to reduce to rational
schemes of government societies which were formed by chance, and are conducted by the private
passions of those who preside in them. His description of the various miseries which force
men to seek for refuge in distant countries affords another instance of his proficiency in
the important and extensive study of human life; and the tenderness with which he recounts
them, another proof of his humanity and benevolence.

It is observable that the close of this poem discovers a change which experience had made in
Mr. Savage's opinions. In a poem written by him in his youth, and published in his Miscellanies,
he declares his contempt of the contracted views and narrow prospects of the middle state of
life, and declares his resolution either to tower like the cedar, or be trampled like the shrub;
but in this poem, though addressed to a prince, he mentions this state of life as comprising
those who ought most to attract reward, those who merit most the confidence of power and the
familiarity of greatness; and, accidentally mentioning this passage to one of his friends,
declared that in his opinion all the virtue of mankind was comprehended in that state.

In describing villas and gardens he did not omit to condemn that absurd custom which prevails
among the English of permitting servants to receive money from strangers for the entertainment
that they receive, and therefore inserted in his poem these lines:

     "But what the flowering pride of gardens rare,
      However royal, or however fair,
      If gates which to excess should still give way,
      Ope but, like Peter's paradise, for pay;
      If perquisited varlets frequent stand,
      And each new walk must a new tax demand;
      What foreign eye but with contempt surveys?
      What Muse shall from oblivion snatch their praise?"

But before the publication of his performance he recollected that the queen allowed her garden
and cave at Richmond to be shown for money; and that she so openly countenanced the practice
that she had bestowed the privilege of showing them as a place of profit on a man whose merit
she valued herself upon rewarding, though she gave him only the liberty of disgracing his country.
He therefore thought, with more prudence than was often exerted by him, that the publication
of these lines might be officiously represented as an insult upon the queen, to whom he owed
his life and his subsistence; and that the propriety of his observation would be no security
against the censures which the unseasonableness of it might draw upon him; he therefore suppressed
the passage in the first edition, but after the queen's death thought the same caution no longer
necessary, and restored it to the proper place. The poem was, therefore, published without
any political faults, and inscribed to the prince; but Mr. Savage, having no friend upon whom
he could prevail to present it to him, had no other method of attracting his observation than
the publication of frequent advertisements, and therefore received no reward from his patron,
however generous on other occasions. This disappointment he never mentioned without indignation,
being by some means or other confident that the prince was not ignorant of his address to him;
and insinuated that if any advances in popularity could have been made by distinguishing him,
he had not written without notice or without reward. He was once inclined to have presented
his poem in person and sent to the printer for a copy with that design; but either his opinion
changed or his resolution deserted him, and he continued to resent neglect without attempting
to force himself into regard. Nor was the public much more favourable than his patron; for
only seventy-two were sold, though the performance was much commended by some whose judgment
in that kind of writing is generally allowed. But Savage easily reconciled himself to mankind
without imputing any defect to his work, by observing that his poem was unluckily published
two days after the prorogation of the parliament, and by consequence at a time when all those
who could be expected to regard it were in the hurry of preparing for their departure, or engaged
in taking leave of others upon their dismission from public affairs. It must be however allowed,
in justification of the public, that this performance is not the most excellent of Mr. Savage's
works; and that, though it cannot be denied to contain many striking sentiments, majestic lines,
and just observations, it is in general not sufficiently polished in the language, or enlivened
in the imagery, or digested in the plan. Thus his poem contributed nothing to the alleviation
of his poverty, which was such as very few could have supported with equal patience; but to
which it must likewise be confessed that few would have been exposed who received punctually
fifty pounds a year; a salary which, though by no means equal to the demands of vanity and
luxury, is yet found sufficient to support families above want, and was undoubtedly more than
the necessities of life require.

But no sooner had he received his pension than he withdrew to his darling privacy, from which
he returned in a short time to his former distress, and for some part of the year generally
lived by chance, eating only when he was invited to the tables of his acquaintances, from which
the meanness of his dress often excluded him, when the politeness and variety of his conversation
would have been thought a sufficient recompense for his entertainment. On a bulk, in a cellar,
or in a glass-house, among thieves and beggars, was to be found the author of "The Wanderer,"
the man of exalted sentiments, extensive views, and curious observations; the man whose remarks
on life might have assisted the statesman, whose ideas of virtue might have enlightened the
moralist, whose eloquence might have influenced senates, and whose delicacy might have polished
courts. It cannot but be imagined that such necessities might sometimes force him upon disreputable
practices; and it is probable that these lines in "The Wanderer" were occasioned by his reflections
on his own conduct:

     "Though misery leads to happiness and truth,
      Unequal to the load this languid youth,
      (Oh, let none censure, if, untried by grief,
      If, amidst woe, untempted by relief),
      He stooped reluctant to low arts of shame,
      Which then, e'en then, he scorned, and blushed to name."

Whoever was acquainted with him was certain to be solicited for small sums, which the frequency
of the request made in time considerable; and he was therefore quickly shunned by those who
were become familiar enough to be trusted with his necessities; but his rambling manner of
life, and constant appearance at houses of public resort, always procured him a new succession
of friends whose kindness had not been exhausted by repeated requests; so that he was seldom
absolutely without resources, but had in his utmost exigencies this comfort, that he always
imagined himself sure of speedy relief. It was observed that he always asked favours of this
kind without the least submission or apparent consciousness of dependence, and that he did
not seem to look upon a compliance with his request as an obligation that deserved any extraordinary
acknowledgments; but a refusal was resented by him as an affront, or complained of as an injury;
nor did he readily reconcile himself to those who either denied to lend, or gave him afterwards
any intimation that they expected to be repaid. It must therefore be acknowledged, in justification
of mankind, that it was not always by the negligence or coldness of his friends that Savage
was distressed, but because it was in reality very difficult to preserve him long in a state
of ease. When once he had entered a tavern, or engaged in a scheme of pleasure, he never retired
till want of money obliged him to some new expedient. If he was entertained in a family, nothing
was any longer to be regarded there but amusement and jollity; wherever Savage entered, he
immediately expected that order and business should fly before him, that all should thenceforward
be left to hazard, and that no dull principle of domestic management should be opposed to his
inclination or intrude upon his gaiety. Once when he was without lodging, meat, or clothes,
one of his friends, a man indeed not remarkable for moderation in his prosperity, left a message
that he desired to see him about nine in the morning. Savage knew that his intention was to
assist him, but was very much disgusted that he should presume to prescribe the hour of his
attendance, and, I believe, refused to visit him, and rejected his kindness.

The same invincible temper, whether firmness or obstinacy, appeared in his conduct to the Lord
Tyrconnel, from whom he very frequently demanded that the allowance which was once paid him
should be restored; but with whom he never appeared to entertain for a moment the thought of
soliciting a reconciliation, and whom he treated at once with all the haughtiness of superiority
and all the bitterness of resentment. He wrote to him, not in a style of supplication or respect,
but of reproach, menace, and contempt; and appeared determined, if he ever regained his allowance,
to hold it only by the right of conquest.

As many more can discover that a man is richer than that he is wiser than themselves, superiority
of understanding is not so readily acknowledged as that of fortune; nor is that haughtiness
which the consciousness of great abilities incites, borne with the same submission as the tyranny
of affluence; and therefore Savage, by asserting his claim to deference and regard, and by
treating those with contempt whom better fortune animated to rebel against him, did not fail
to raise a great number of enemies in the different classes of mankind. Those who thought themselves
raised above him by the advantages of riches hated him because they found no protection from
the petulance of his wit. Those who were esteemed for their writings feared him as a critic,
and maligned him as a rival; and almost all the smaller wits were his professed enemies.

Among these Mr. Miller so far indulged his resentment as to introduce him in a farce, and direct
him to be personated on the stage in a dress like that which he then wore; a mean insult, which
only insinuated that Savage had but one coat, and which was therefore despised by him rather
than resented; for, though he wrote a lampoon against Miller, he never printed it: and as no
other person ought to prosecute that revenge from which the person who was injured desisted,
I shall not preserve what Mr. Savage suppressed; of which the publication would indeed have
been a punishment too severe for so impotent an assault.

The great hardships of poverty were to Savage not the want of lodging or food, but the neglect
and contempt which it drew upon him. He complained that, as his affairs grew desperate, he
found his reputation for capacity visibly decline; that his opinion in questions of criticism
was no longer regarded when his coat was out of fashion; and that those who, in the interval
of his prosperity, were always encouraging him to great undertakings by encomiums on his genius
and assurances of success, now received any mention of his designs with coldness, thought that
the subjects on which he proposed to write were very difficult, and were ready to inform him
that the event of a poem was uncertain, that an author ought to employ much time in the consideration
of his plan, and not presume to sit down to write in consequence of a few cursory ideas and
a superficial knowledge; difficulties were started on all sides, and he was no longer qualified
for any performance but "The Volunteer Laureate."

Yet even this kind of contempt never depressed him: for he always preserved a steady confidence
in his own capacity, and believed nothing above his reach which he should at any time earnestly
endeavour to attain. He formed schemes of the same kind with regard to knowledge and to fortune,
and flattered himself with advances to be made in science, as with riches, to be enjoyed in
some distant period of his life. For the acquisition of knowledge he was indeed much better
qualified than for that of riches; for he was naturally inquisitive, and desirous of the conversation
of those from whom any information was to be obtained, but by no means solicitous to improve
those opportunities that were sometimes offered of raising his fortune; and he was remarkably
retentive of his ideas, which, when once he was in possession of them, rarely forsook him;
a quality which could never be communicated to his money.

While he was thus wearing out his life in expectation that the queen would some time recollect
her promise, he had recourse to the usual practice of writers, and published proposals for
printing his works by subscription, to which he was encouraged by the success of many who had
not a better right to the favour of the public; but, whatever was the reason, he did not find
the world equally inclined to favour him; and he observed with some discontent, that though
he offered his works at half a guinea, he was able to procure but a small number in comparison
with those who subscribed twice as much to Duck. Nor was it without indignation that he saw
his proposals neglected by the queen, who patronised Mr. Duck's with uncommon ardour, and incited
a competition among those who attended the court who should most promote his interest, and
who should first offer a subscription. This was a distinction to which Mr. Savage made no scruple
of asserting that his birth, his misfortunes, and his genius, gave a fairer title than could
be pleaded by him on whom it was conferred.

Savage's applications were, however, not universally unsuccessful; for some of the nobility
countenanced his design, encouraged his proposals, and subscribed with great liberality. He
related of the Duke of Chandos particularly, that upon receiving his proposals he sent him
ten guineas. But the money which his subscriptions afforded him was not less volatile than
that which he received from his other schemes; whenever a subscription was paid him, he went
to a tavern; and as money so collected is necessarily received in small sums, he never was
able to send his poems to the press, but for many years continued his solicitation, and squandered
whatever he obtained.

The project of printing his works was frequently revived; and as his proposals grew obsolete,
new ones were printed with fresher dates. To form schemes for the publication was one of his
favourite amusements; nor was he ever more at ease than when, with any friend who readily fell
in with his schemes, he was adjusting the print, forming the advertisements, and regulating
the dispersion of his new edition, which he really intended some time to publish, and which,
as long as experience had shown him the impossibility of printing the volume together, he at
last determined to divide into weekly or monthly numbers, that the profits of the first might
supply the expenses of the next. But wherever he came, his address secured him friends, whom
his necessities soon alienated; so that he had perhaps a more numerous acquaintance than any
man ever before attained, there being scarcely any person eminent on any account to whom he
was not known, or whose character he was not in some degree able to delineate. To the acquisition
of this extensive acquaintance every circumstance of his life contributed. He excelled in the
arts of conversation, and therefore willingly practised them. He had seldom any home, or even
a lodging, in which he could be private, and therefore was driven into public-houses for the
common conveniences of life and supports of nature. He was always ready to comply with every
invitation, having no employment to withhold him, and often no money to provide for himself;
and by dining with one company he never failed of obtaining an introduction into another.

Thus dissipated was his life, and thus casual his subsistence; yet did not the distraction
of his views hinder him from reflection, nor the uncertainty of his condition depress his gaiety.
When he had wandered about without any fortunate adventure by which he was led into a tavern,
he sometimes retired into the fields, and was able to employ his mind in study, to amuse it
with pleasing imaginations; and seldom appeared to be melancholy but when some sudden misfortune
had just fallen upon him; and even then in a few moments he would disentangle himself from
his perplexity, adopt the subject of conversation, and apply his mind wholly to the objects
that others presented to it. This life, unhappy as it may be already imagined, was yet embittered
in 1738 with new calamities. The death of the queen deprived him of all the prospects of preferment
with which he so long entertained his imagination; and as Sir Robert Walpole had before given
him reason to believe that he never intended the performance of his promise, he was now abandoned
again to fortune. Introduction is treated on 1743 boundary of a plain in which rise

So peculiar were the misfortunes of this man, deprived of an estate and title by a particular
law, exposed and abandoned by a mother, defrauded by a mother of a fortune which his father
had allotted him, he entered the world without a friend; and though his abilities forced themselves
into esteem and reputation, he was never able to obtain any real advantage; and whatever prospects
arose, were always intercepted as he began to approach them. The king's intentions in his favour
were frustrated; his dedication to the prince, whose generosity on every other occasion was
eminent, procured him no reward; Sir Robert Walpole, who valued himself upon keeping his promise
to others, broke it to him without regret; and the bounty of the queen was, after her death,
withdrawn from him, and from him only.

His distress was now publicly known, and his friends therefore thought it proper to concert
some measures for his relief; and one of them [Pope] wrote a letter to him, in which he expressed
his concern "for the miserable withdrawing of this pension;" and gave him hopes that in a short
time he should find himself supplied with a competence, "without any dependence on those little
creatures which we are pleased to call the Great." The scheme proposed for this happy and independent
subsistence was, that he should retire into Wales, and receive an allowance of fifty pounds
a year, to be raised by a subscription, on which he was to live privately in a cheap place,
without aspiring any more to affluence, or having any further care of reputation. This offer
Mr. Savage gladly accepted, though with intentions very different from those of his friends;
for they proposed that he should continue an exile from London for ever, and spend all the
remaining part of his life at Swansea; but he designed only to take the opportunity which their
scheme offered him of retreating for a short time, that he might prepare his play for the stage,
and his other works for the press, and then to return to London to exhibit his tragedy, and
live upon the profits of his own labour. With regard to his works he proposed very great improvements,
which would have required much time or great application; and, when he had finished them, he
designed to do justice to his subscribers by publishing them according to his proposals. As
he was ready to entertain himself with future pleasures, he had planned out a scheme of life
for the country, of which he had no knowledge but from pastorals and songs. He imagined that
he should be transported to scenes of flowery felicity, like those which one poet has reflected
to another; and had projected a perpetual round of innocent pleasures, of which he suspected
no interruption from pride, or ignorance, or brutality.

He now began very sensibly to feel the miseries of dependence. Those by whom he was to be supported
began to prescribe to him with an air of authority, which he knew not how decently to resent,
nor patiently to bear; and he soon discovered from the conduct of most of his subscribers,
that he was yet in the hands of "little creatures." Of the insolence that he was obliged to
suffer he gave many instances, of which none appeared to raise his indignation to a greater
height than the method which was taken of furnishing him with clothes. Instead of consulting
him, and allowing him to send a tailor his orders for what they thought proper to allow him,
they proposed to send for a tailor to take his measure, and then to consult how they should
equip him. This treatment was not very delicate, nor was it such as Savage's humanity would
have suggested to him on a like occasion; but it had scarcely deserved mention, had it not,
by affecting him in an uncommon degree, shown the peculiarity of his character. Upon hearing
the design that was formed, he came to the lodging of a friend with the most violent agonies
of rage; and, being asked what it could be that gave him such disturbance, he replied with
the utmost vehemence of indignation, "That they had sent for a tailor to measure him."

How the affair ended was never inquired, for fear of renewing his uneasiness. It is probable
that, upon recollection, he submitted with a good grace to what he could not avoid, and that
he discovered no resentment where he had no power. He was, however, not humbled to implicit
and universal compliance; for when the gentleman who had first informed him of the design to
support him by a subscription attempted to procure a reconciliation with the Lord Tyrconnel,
he could by no means be prevailed upon to comply with the measures that were proposed.

A letter was written for him to Sir William Lemon, to prevail upon him to interpose his good
offices with Lord Tyrconnel, in which he solicited Sir William's assistance "for a man who
really needed it as much as any man could well do;" and informed him that he was retiring "for
ever to a place where he should no more trouble his relations, friends, or enemies;" he confessed
that his passion had betrayed him to some conduct, with regard to Lord Tyrconnel, for which
he could not but heartily ask his pardon; and as he imagined Lord Tyrconnel's passion might
be yet so high, that he would not "receive a letter from him," begged that Sir William would
endeavour to soften him; and expressed his hopes that he would comply with this request, and
that "so small a relation would not harden his heart against him."

That any man should presume to dictate a letter to him was not very agreeable to Mr. Savage;
and therefore he was, before he had opened it, not much inclined to approve it. But when he
read it he found it contained sentiments entirely opposite to his own, and, as he asserted,
to the truth; and therefore, instead of copying it, wrote his friend a letter full of masculine
resentment and warm expostulations. He very justly observed, that the style was too supplicatory,
and the representation too abject, and that he ought at least to have made him complain with
"the dignity of a gentleman in distress." He declared that he would not write the paragraph
in which he was to ask Lord Tyrconnel's pardon; for, "he despised his pardon, and therefore
could not heartily, and would not hypocritically, ask it." He remarked that his friend made
a very unreasonable distinction between himself and him; for, says he, "when you mention men
of high rank in your own character," they are "those little creatures whom we are pleased to
call the Great;" but when you address them "in mine," no servility is sufficiently humble.
He then with propriety explained the ill consequences which might be expected from such a letter,
which his relations would print in their own defence, and which would for ever be produced
as a full answer to all that he should allege against them; for he always intended to publish
a minute account of the treatment which he had received. It is to be remembered, to the honour
of the gentleman by whom this letter was drawn up, that he yielded to Mr. Savage's reasons,
and agreed that it ought to be suppressed.

After many alterations and delays, a subscription was at length raised, which did not amount
to fifty pounds a year, though twenty were paid by one gentleman; such was the generosity of
mankind, that what had been done by a player without solicitation, could not now be effected
by application and interest; and Savage had a great number to court and to obey for a pension
less than that which Mrs. Oldfield paid him without exacting any servilities. Mr. Savage, however,
was satisfied, and willing to retire, and was convinced that the allowance, though scanty,
would be more than sufficient for him, being now determined to commence a rigid economist,
and to live according to the exact rules of frugality; for nothing was in his opinion more
contemptible than a man who, when he knew his income, exceeded it; and yet he confessed that
instances of such folly were too common, and lamented that some men were not trusted with their
own money. He was furnished with fifteen guineas, and informed that they would be sufficient,
not only for the expense of his journey, but for his support in Wales for some time; and that
there remained but little more of the first collection. He promised a strict adherence to his
maxims of parsimony, and went away in the stage-coach; nor did his friends expect to hear from
him till he informed them of his arrival at Swansea. But when they least expected, arrived
a letter dated the fourteenth day after his departure, in which he sent them word that he was
yet upon the road, and without money; and that he therefore could not proceed without a remittance.
They then sent him the money that was in their hands, with which he was enabled to reach Bristol,
from whence he was to go to Swansea by water.

At Bristol he found an embargo laid upon the shipping, so that he could not immediately obtain
a passage; and being therefore obliged to stay there some time, he with his usual felicity
ingratiated himself with many of the principal inhabitants, was invited to their houses, distinguished
at their public feasts, and treated with a regard that gratified his vanity, and therefore
easily engaged his affection.

He began very early after his retirement to complain of the conduct of his friends in London,
and irritated many of them so much by his letters, that they withdrew, however honourably,
their contributions; and it is believed that little more was paid him than the twenty pounds
a year, which were allowed him by the gentleman who proposed the subscription.

After some stay at Bristol he retired to Swansea, the place originally proposed for his residence,
where he lived about a year, very much dissatisfied with the diminution of his salary; but
contracted, as in other places, acquaintance with those who were most distinguished in that
country, among whom he has celebrated Mr. Powel and Mrs. Jones, by some verses which he inserted
in The Gentleman's Magazine. Here he completed his tragedy, of which two acts were wanting
when he left London; and was desirous of coming to town, to bring it upon the stage. This design
was very warmly opposed; and he was advised, by his chief benefactor, to put it into the hands
of Mr. Thomson and Mr. Mallet, that it might be fitted for the stage, and to allow his friends
to receive the profits, out of which an annual pension should be paid him.

This proposal he rejected with the utmost contempt. He was by no means convinced that the judgment
of those to whom he was required to submit was superior to his own. He was now determined,
as he expressed it, to be "no longer kept in leading-strings," and had no elevated idea of
"his bounty, who proposed to pension him out of the profits of his own labours."

He attempted in Wales to promote a subscription for his works, and had once hopes of success;
but in a short time afterwards formed a resolution of leaving that part of the country, to
which he thought it not reasonable to be confined for the gratification of those who, having
promised him a liberal income, had no sooner banished him to a remote corner than they reduced
his allowance to a salary scarcely equal to the necessities of life. Moiety had an reading'time
more steal well, and some of least cits end to wax impatient, in cattiness of the frequently-repeated
advice, "preceptor'mt in every urgency!" At a yokel start down of the screen, and as soon as he has
retrieve hint, answers the yard that he has been "a-earl to'pica for an promise," and that
the dodger had "go therefore for Tatsfield,'most as shortly as always

questions to the "sound, twang, sound" to his antler.

And nowadays, a sum of blanket having been dismissed from conifer, away remark "Tummas," and make

did the longitude of the point where dodger broke through the hedge. To this spot is the collection

how delighted is his rathbeggin.

the sir of the cat-o'-nine-tails, but the laugh of the horseman, a feeling whom may be formed
of what Virgil call:
"Clamorque, clangorque tubarum."

A knock is the result! He was not only caressed and treated, but had a collection made for him
of about thirty pounds, with which it had been happy if he had immediately departed for London;
but his negligence did not suffer him to consider that such proofs of kindness were not often
to be expected, and that this ardour of benevolence was in a great degree the effect of novelty,
and might, probably, be every day less; and therefore he took no care to improve the happy
time, but was encouraged by one favour to hope for another, till at length generosity was exhausted,
and officiousness wearied.

Another part of his misconduct was the practice of prolonging his visits to unseasonable hours,
and disconcerting all the families into which he was admitted. This was an error in a place
of commerce which all the charms of his conversation could not compensate; for what trader
would purchase such airy satisfaction by the loss of solid gain, which must be the consequence
of midnight merriment, as those hours which were gained at night were generally lost in the
morning? Thus Mr. Savage, after the curiosity of the inhabitants was gratified, found the number
of his friends daily decreasing, perhaps without suspecting for what reason their conduct was
altered; for he still continued to harass, with his nocturnal intrusions, those that yet countenanced
him, and admitted him to their houses.

But he did not spend all the time of his residence at Bristol in visits or at taverns, for
he sometimes returned to his studies, and began several considerable designs. When he felt
an inclination to write, he always retired from the knowledge of his friends, and lay hid in
an obscure part of the suburbs, till he found himself again desirous of company, to which it
is likely that intervals of absence made him more welcome. He was always full of his design
of returning to London, to bring his tragedy upon the stage; but, having neglected to depart
with the money that was raised for him, he could not afterwards procure a sum sufficient to
defray the expenses of his journey; nor perhaps would a fresh supply have had any other effect
than, by putting immediate pleasures into his power, to have driven the thoughts of his journey
out of his mind. While he was thus spending the day in contriving a scheme for the morrow,
distress stole upon him by imperceptible degrees. His conduct had already wearied some of those
who were at first enamoured of his conversation; but he might, perhaps, still have devolved
to others, whom he might have entertained with equal success, had not the decay of his clothes
made it no longer consistent with their vanity to admit him to their tables, or to associate
with him in public places. He now began to find every man from home at whose house he called;
and was therefore no longer able to procure the necessaries of life, but wandered about the
town, slighted and neglected, in quest of a dinner, which he did not always obtain.

To complete his misery, he was pursued by the officers for small debts which he had contracted;
and was therefore obliged to withdraw from the small number of friends from whom he had still
reason to hope for favours. His custom was to lie in bed the greatest part of the day, and
to get out in the dark with the utmost privacy, and, after having paid his visit, return again
before morning to his lodging, which was in the garret of an obscure inn. Being thus excluded
on one hand, and confined on the other, he suffered the utmost extremities of poverty, and
often fasted so long that he was seized with faintness, and had lost his appetite, not being
able to bear the smell of meat till the action of his stomach was restored by a cordial. In
this distress, he received a remittance of five pounds from London, with which he provided
himself a decent coat, and determined to go to London, but unhappily spent his money at a favourite
tavern. Thus was he again confined to Bristol, where he was every day hunted by bailiffs. In
this exigence he once more found a friend, who sheltered him in his house, though at the usual
inconveniences with which his company was attended; for he could neither be persuaded to go
to bed in the night nor to rise in the day.

It is observable, that in these various scenes of misery he was always disengaged and cheerful:
he at some times pursued his studies, and at others continued or enlarged his epistolary correspondence;
nor was he ever so far dejected as to endeavour to procure an increase of his allowance by
any other methods than accusations and reproaches.

He had now no longer any hopes of assistance from his friends at Bristol, who as merchants,
and by consequence sufficiently studious of profit, cannot be supposed to have looked with
much compassion upon negligence and extravagance, or to think any excellence equivalent to
a fault of such consequence as neglect of economy. It is natural to imagine, that many of those
who would have relieved his real wants, were discouraged from the exertion of their benevolence
by observation of the use which was made of their favours, and conviction that relief would
be only momentary, and that the same necessity would quickly return.

At last he quitted the house of his friend, and returned to his lodgings at the inn, still
intending to set out in a few days for London, but on the 10th of January, 1742-3, having been
at supper with two of his friends, he was at his return to his lodgings arrested for a debt
of about eight pounds, which he owed at a coffee-house, and conducted to the house of a sheriff's
officer. The account which he gives of this misfortune, in a letter to one of the gentlemen
with whom he had supped, is too remarkable to be omitted.

"It was not a little unfortunate for me, that I spent yesterday's evening with you; because
the hour hindered me from entering on my new lodging; however, I have now got one, but such
an one as I believe nobody would choose.

"I was arrested at the suit of Mrs. Read, just as I was going upstairs to bed, at Mr. Bowyer's;
but taken in so private a manner, that I believe nobody at the White Lion is apprised of it;
though I let the officers know the strength, or rather weakness, of my pocket, yet they treated
me with the utmost civility; and even when they conducted me to confinement, it was in such
a manner, that I verily believe I could have escaped, which I would rather be ruined than have
done, notwithstanding the whole amount of my finances was but threepence halfpenny.

"In the first place, I must insist that you will industriously conceal this from Mrs. S---s,
because I would not have her good nature suffer that pain which I know she would be apt to
feel on this occasion.

"Next, I conjure you, dear sir, by all the ties of friendship, by no means to have one uneasy
thought on my account; but to have the same pleasantry of countenance, and unruffled serenity
of mind, which (God be praised!) I have in this, and have had in a much severer calamity. Furthermore,
I charge you, if you value my friendship as truly as I do yours, not to utter, or even harbour,
the least resentment against Mrs. Read. I believe she has ruined me, but I freely forgive her;
and (though I will never more have any intimacy with her) I would, at a due distance, rather
do her an act of good than ill-will. Lastly (pardon the expression), I absolutely command you
not to offer me any pecuniary assistance nor to attempt getting me any from any one of your
friends. At another time, or on any other occasion, you may, dear friend, be well assured I
would rather write to you in the submissive style of a request than that of a peremptory command.

"However, that my truly valuable friend may not think I am too proud to ask a favour, let me
entreat you to let me have your boy to attend me for this day, not only for the sake of saving
me the expense of porters, but for the delivery of some letters to people whose names I would
not have known to strangers.

"The civil treatment I have thus far met from those whose prisoner I am, makes me thankful
to the Almighty, that though He has thought fit to visit me (on my birth-night) with affliction,
yet (such is His great goodness!) my affliction is not without alleviating circumstances. I
murmur not; but am all resignation to the divine will. As to the world, I hope that I shall
be endued by Heaven with that presence of mind, that serene dignity in misfortune, that constitutes
the character of a true nobleman; a dignity far beyond that of coronets; a nobility arising
from the just principles of philosophy, refined and exalted by those of Christianity."

He continued five days at the officer's, in hopes that he should be able to procure bail, and
avoid the necessity of going to prison. The state in which he passed his time, and the treatment
which he received, are very justly expressed by him in a letter which he wrote to a friend:
"The whole day," says he, "has been employed in various people's filling my head with their
foolish chimerical systems, which has obliged me coolly (as far as nature will admit) to digest,
and accommodate myself to every different person's way of thinking; hurried from one wild system
to another, till it has quite made a chaos of my imagination, and nothing done--promised--disappointed--ordered
to send, every hour, from one part of the town to the other."

When his friends, who had hitherto caressed and applauded, found that to give bail and pay
the debt was the same, they all refused to preserve him from a prison at the expense of eight
pounds: and therefore, after having been for some time at the officer's house "at an immense
expense," as he observes in his letter, he was at length removed to Newgate. This expense he
was enabled to support by the generosity of Mr. Nash at Bath, who, upon receiving from him
an account of his condition, immediately sent him five guineas, and promised to promote his
subscription at Bath with all his interest.

By his removal to Newgate he obtained at least a freedom from suspense, and rest from the disturbing
vicissitudes of hope and disappointment: he now found that his friends were only companions
who were willing to share his gaiety, but not to partake of his misfortunes; and therefore
he no longer expected any assistance from them. It must, however, be observed of one gentleman,
that he offered to release him by paying the debt, but that Mr. Savage would not consent, I
suppose because he thought he had before been too burthensome to him. He was offered by some
of his friends that a collection should be made for his enlargement; but he "treated the proposal,"
and declared "he should again treat it, with disdain. As to writing any mendicant letters,
he had too high a spirit, and determined only to write to some ministers of state, to try to
regain his pension."

He continued to complain of those that had sent him into the country, and objected to them,
that he had "lost the profits of his play, which had been finished three years;" and in another
letter declares his resolution to publish a pamphlet, that the world might know how "he had
been used."

This pamphlet was never written; for he in a very short time recovered his usual tranquillity,
and cheerfully applied himself to more inoffensive studies. He, indeed, steadily declared that
he was promised a yearly allowance of fifty pounds, and never received half the sum; but he
seemed to resign himself to that as well as to other misfortunes, and lose the remembrance
of it in his amusements and employments. The cheerfulness with which he bore his confinement
appears from the following letter, which he wrote January the 30th, to one of his friends in
London:

"I now write to you from my confinement in Newgate, where I have been ever since Monday last
was se'nnight, and where I enjoy myself with much more tranquillity than I have known for upwards
of a twelvemonth past; having a room entirely to myself, and pursuing the amusement of my poetical
studies, uninterrupted, and agreeable to my mind. I thank the Almighty, I am now all collected
in myself; and, though my person is in confinement, my mind can expatiate on ample and useful
subjects with all the freedom imaginable. I am now more conversant with the Nine than ever,
and if, instead of a Newgate bird, I may be allowed to be a bird of the Muses, I assure you,
sir, I sing very freely in my cage; sometimes, indeed, in the plaintive notes of the nightingale;
but at others, in the cheerful strains of the lark."

In another letter he observes, that he ranges from one subject to another, without confining
himself to any particular task; and that he was employed one week upon one attempt, and the
next upon another.

Surely the fortitude of this man deserves, at least, to be mentioned with applause; and, whatever
faults may be imputed to him, the virtue of suffering well cannot be denied him. The two powers
which, in the opinion of Epictetus, constituted a wise man, are those of bearing and forbearing,
which it cannot indeed be affirmed to have been equally possessed by Savage; and indeed the
want of one obliged him very frequently to practise the other. He was treated by Mr. Dagge,
the keeper of the prison, with great humanity; was supported by him at his own table, without
any certainty of a recompense; had a room to himself, to which he could at any time retire
from all disturbance; was allowed to stand at the door of the prison, and sometimes taken out
into the fields; so that he suffered fewer hardships in prison than he had been accustomed
to undergo in the greatest part of his life.

The keeper did not confine his benevolence to a gentle execution of his office, but made some
overtures to the creditor for his release, though without effect; and continued, during the
whole time of his imprisonment, to treat him with the utmost tenderness and civility.

Mr. Savage very frequently received visits, and sometimes presents, from his acquaintances:
but they did not amount to a subsistence, for the greater part of which he was indebted to
the generosity of this keeper; but these favours, however they might endear to him the particular
persons from whom he received them, were very far from impressing upon his mind any advantageous
ideas of the people of Bristol, and therefore he thought he could not more properly employ
himself in prison than in writing a poem called "London and Bristol Delineated."

When he had brought this poem to its present state, which, without considering the chasm, is
not perfect, he wrote to London an account of his design, and informed his friend that he was
determined to print it with his name; but enjoined him not to communicate his intention to
his Bristol acquaintance. The gentleman, surprised at his resolution, endeavoured to persuade
him from publishing it, at least from prefixing his name; and declared that he could not reconcile
the injunction of secrecy with his resolution to own it at its first appearance. To this Mr.
Savage returned an answer agreeable to his character, in the following terms:--

"I received yours this morning; and not without a little surprise at the contents. To answer
a question with a question, you ask me concerning London and Bristol, why will I add DELINEATED?
Why did Mr. Woolaston add the same word to his Religion of Nature? I suppose that it was his
will and pleasure to add it in his case: and it is mine to do so in my own. You are pleased
to tell me that you understand not why secrecy is enjoined, and yet I intend to set my name
to it. My answer is,--I have my private reasons, which I am not obliged to explain to any one.
You doubt my friend Mr. S----would not approve of it. And what is it to me whether he does
or not? Do you imagine that Mr. S---- is to dictate to me? If any man who calls himself my
friend should assume such an air, I would spurn at his friendship with contempt. You say, I
seem to think so by not letting him know it. And suppose I do, what then? Perhaps I can give
reasons for that disapprobation, very foreign from what you would imagine. You go on in saying,
Suppose I should not put my name to it. My answer is, that I will not suppose any such thing,
being determined to the contrary: neither, sir, would I have you suppose that I applied to
you for want of another press: nor would I have you imagine that I owe Mr. S---- obligations
which I do not."

Such was his imprudence, and such his obstinate adherence to his own resolutions, however absurd!
A prisoner! supported by charity! and, whatever insults he might have received during the latter
part of his stay at Bristol, once caressed, esteemed, and presented with a liberal collection,
he could forget on a sudden his danger and his obligations, to gratify the petulance of his
wit or the eagerness of his resentment, and publish a satire by which he might reasonably expect
that he should alienate those who then supported him, and provoke those whom he could neither
resist nor escape.

 His judgment was accurate,
his apprehension quick, and his memory so tenacious, that he was frequently observed to know
what he had learned from others, in a short time, better that those by whom he was informed;
and could frequently recollect incidents with all their combination of circumstances, which
few would have regarded at the present time, but which the quickness of his apprehension impressed
upon him. He had the art of escaping from his own reflections, and accommodating himself to
every new scene. He had therefore made in coffee-houses the same proficiency as others in their
closets; and it is remarkable that the writings of a man of little education and little reading
have an air of learning scarcely to be found in any other performances, but which perhaps as
often obscures as embellishes them.

His method of life particularly qualified him for conversation, of which he knew how to practise
all the graces. He was never vehement or loud, but at once modest and easy, open and respectful;
his language was vivacious or elegant, and equally happy upon grave and humorous subjects.
He was generally censured for not knowing when to retire; but that was not the defect of his
judgment, but of his fortune: when he left his company he used frequently to spend the remaining
part of the night in the street, or at least was abandoned to gloomy reflections, which it
is not strange that he delayed as long as he could; and sometimes forgot that he gave others
pain to avoid it himself.

It cannot be said that he made use of his abilities for the direction of his own conduct; an
irregular and dissipated manner of life had made him the slave of every passion that happened
to be excited by the presence of its object, and that slavery to his passions reciprocally
produced a life irregular and dissipated. He was not master of his own motions, nor could promise
anything for the next day.

With regard to his economy, nothing can be added to the relation of his life. He appeared to
think himself born to be supported by others, and dispensed from all necessity of providing
for himself; he therefore never prosecuted any scheme of advantage, nor endeavoured even to
secure the profits which his writings might have afforded him. His temper was, in consequence
of the dominion of his passions, uncertain and capricious; he was easily engaged, and easily
disgusted; but he is accused of retaining his hatred more tenaciously than his benevolence.
He was compassionate both by nature and principle, and always ready to perform offices of humanity;
but when he was provoked (and very small offences were sufficient to provoke him), he would
prosecute his revenge with the utmost acrimony till his passion had subsided.

His friendship was therefore of little value; for though he was zealous in the support or vindication
of those whom he loved, yet it was always dangerous to trust him, because he considered himself
as discharged by the first quarrel from all ties of honour and gratitude; and would betray
those secrets which in the warmth of confidence had been imparted to him. This practice drew
upon him an universal accusation of ingratitude; nor can it be denied that he was very ready
to set himself free from the load of an obligation; for he could not bear to conceive himself
in a state of dependence, his pride being equally powerful with his other passions, and appearing
in the form of insolence at one time, and of vanity at another. Vanity, the most innocent species
of pride, was most frequently predominant: he could not easily leave off, when he had once
begun to mention himself or his works; nor ever read his verses without stealing his eyes from
the page, to discover in the faces of his audience how they were affected with any favourite
passage.

A kinder name than that of vanity ought to be given to the delicacy with which he was always
careful to separate his own merit from every other man's, and to reject that praise to which
he had no claim. He did not forget, in mentioning his performances, to mark every line that
had been suggested or amended; and was so accurate as to relate that he owed three words in
"The Wanderer" to the advice of his friends.

In cases indifferent he was zealous for virtue, truth, and justice: he knew very well the necessity
of goodness to the present and future happiness of mankind; nor is there perhaps any writer
who has less endeavoured to please by flattering the appetites, or perverting the judgment.

As an author, therefore, and he now ceases to influence mankind in any other character, if
one piece which he had resolved to suppress be excepted, he has very little to fear from the
strictest moral or religious censure. And though he may not be altogether secure against the
objections of the critic, it must however be acknowledged that his works are the productions
of a genius truly poetical; and, what many writers who have been more lavishly applauded cannot
boast, that they have an original air, which has no resemblance of any foregoing writer, that
the versification and sentiments have a cast peculiar to themselves, which no man can imitate
with success, because what was nature in Savage would in another be affectation. It must be
confessed that his descriptions are striking, his images animated, his fictions justly imagined,
and his allegories artfully pursued; that his diction is elevated, though sometimes forced,
and his numbers sonorous and majestic, though frequently sluggish and encumbered. Of his style
the general fault is harshness, and its general excellence is dignity; of his sentiments, the
prevailing beauty is simplicity, and uniformity the prevailing defect.

For his life, or for his writings, none who candidly consider his fortune will think an apology
either necessary or difficult. If he was not always sufficiently instructed in his subject,
his knowledge was at least greater than could have been attained by others in the same state.
If his works were sometimes unfinished, accuracy cannot reasonably be expected from a man oppressed
with want, which he has no hope of relieving but by a speedy publication.

This relation will not be wholly without its use, if those who languish under any part of his
sufferings shall be enabled to fortify their patience by reflecting that they feel only these
afflictions from which the abilities of Savage did not exempt him; or those who, in confidence
of superior capacities or attainments, disregard the common maxims of life, shall be reminded
that nothing will supply the want of prudence; and that negligence and irregularity, long continued,
will make knowledge useless, wit ridiculous, and genius contemptible.

SWIFT.

Jonathan Swift was, according to an account said to be written by himself, the son of Jonathan
Swift, an attorney, and was born at Dublin on St. Andrew's day, 1667: according to his own
report, as delivered by Pope to Spence, he was born at Leicester, the son of a clergyman who
was minister of a parish in Herefordshire. During his life the place of his birth was undetermined.
He was contented to be called an Irishman by the Irish; but would occasionally call himself
an Englishman. The question may, without much regret, be left in the obscurity in which he
delighted to involve it.

Whatever was his birth, his education was Irish. He was sent at the age of six to the school
at Kilkenny, and in his fifteenth year (1682) was admitted into the University of Dublin. In
his academical studies he was either not diligent or not happy. It must disappoint every reader's
expectation, that, when at the usual time he claimed the Bachelorship of Arts, he was found
by the examiners too conspicuously deficient for regular admission, and obtained his degree
at last by SPECIAL FAVOUR; a term used in that university to denote want of merit.

Of this disgrace it may be easily supposed that he was much ashamed, and shame had its proper
effect in producing reformation. He resolved from that time to study eight hours a day, and
continued his industry for seven years, with what improvement is sufficiently known. This part
of his story well deserves to be remembered; it may afford useful admonition and powerful encouragement
to men whose abilities have been made for a time useless by their passions or pleasures, and
who having lost one part of life in idleness, are tempted to throw away the remainder in despair.
In this course of daily application he continued three years longer at Dublin; and in this
time, if the observation and memory of an old companion may be trusted, he drew the first sketch
of his "Tale of a Tub."

When he was about one-and-twenty (1688), being by the death of Godwin Swift, his uncle, who
had supported him, left without subsistence, he went to consult his mother, who then lived
at Leicester, about the future course of his life; and by her direction solicited the advice
and patronage of Sir William Temple, who had married one of Mrs. Swift's relations, and whose
father Sir John Temple, Master of the Rolls in Ireland, had lived in great familiarity of friendship
with Godwin Swift, by whom Jonathan had been to that time maintained.

Temple received with sufficient kindness the nephew of his father's friend, with whom he was,
when they conversed together, so much pleased, that he detained him two years in his house.
Here he became known to King William, who sometimes visited Temple, when he was disabled by
the gout, and, being attended by Swift in the garden, showed him how to cut asparagus in the
Dutch way. King William's notions were all military; and he expressed his kindness to Swift
by offering to make him a captain of horse.

When Temple removed to Moor Park, he took Swift with him; and when he was consulted by the
Earl of Portland about the expedience of complying with a bill then depending for making parliaments
triennial, against which King William was strongly prejudiced, after having in vain tried to
show the earl that the proposal involved nothing dangerous to royal power, he sent Swift for
the same purpose to the king. Swift, who probably was proud of his employment, and went with
all the confidence of a young man, found his arguments, and his art of displaying them, made
totally ineffectual by the predetermination of the king; and used to mention this disappointment
as his first antidote against vanity. Before he left Ireland he contracted a disorder, as he
thought, by eating too much fruit. The original of diseases is commonly obscure. Almost everybody
eats as much fruit as he can get, without any great inconvenience. The disease of Swift was
giddiness with deafness, which attacked him from time to time, began very early, pursued him
through life, and at last sent him to the grave, deprived of reason. Being much oppressed at
Moor Park by this grievous malady, he was advised to try his native air, and went to Ireland;
but finding no benefit, returned to Sir William, at whose house he continued his studies, and
is known to have read, among other books, Cyprian and Irenaeus. He thought exercise of great
necessity, and used to run half a mile up and down a hill every two hours.

It is easy to imagine that the mode in which his first degree was conferred left him no great
fondness for the University of Dublin, and therefore he resolved to become a Master of Arts
at Oxford. In the testimonial which he produced the words of disgrace were omitted; and he
took his Master's degree (July 5, 1692) with such reception and regard as fully contented him.

While he lived with Temple, he used to pay his mother at Leicester a yearly visit. He travelled
on foot, unless some violence of weather drove him into a waggon; and at night he would go
to a penny lodging, where he purchased clean sheets for sixpence. This practice Lord Orrery
imputes to his innate love of grossness and vulgarity: some may ascribe it to his desire of
surveying human life through all its varieties: and others, perhaps with equal probability,
to a passion which seems to have been deeply fixed in his heart, the love of a shilling. In
time he began to think that his attendance at Moor Park deserved some other recompense than
the pleasure, however mingled with improvement, of Temple's conversation; and grew so impatient,
that (1694) he went away in discontent. Temple, conscious of having given reason for complaint,
is said to have made him deputy Master of the Rolls in Ireland; which, according to his kinsman's
account, was an office which he knew him not able to discharge. Swift therefore resolved to
enter into the Church, in which he had at first no higher hopes than of the chaplainship to
the Factory at Lisbon; but being recommended to Lord Capel, he obtained the prebend of Kilroot
in Connor, of about a hundred pounds a year. But the infirmities of Temple made a companion
like Swift so necessary, that he invited him back, with a promise to procure him English preferment
in exchange for the prebend, which he desired him to resign. With this request Swift complied,
having perhaps equally repented their separation, and they lived on together with mutual satisfaction;
and, in the four years that passed between his return and Temple's death, it is probable that
he wrote the "Tale of a Tub," and the "Battle of the Books."

Swift began early to think, or to hope, that he was a poet, and wrote Pindaric Odes to Temple,
to the king, and to the Athenian Society, a knot of obscure men, who published a periodical
pamphlet of answers to questions, sent, or supposed to be sent, by letters. I have been told
that Dryden, having perused these verses, said, "Cousin Swift, you will never be a poet;" and
that this denunciation was the motive of Swift's perpetual malevolence to Dryden. In 1699 Temple
died, and left a legacy with his manuscripts to Swift, for whom he had obtained, from King
William, a promise of the first prebend that should be vacant at Westminster or Canterbury. That

 After
its appearance, paying a visit to some bishop, he heard mention made of the new pamphlet that
Burnet had written, replete with political knowledge. When he seemed to doubt Burnet's right
to the work, he was told by the bishop that he was "a young man," and still persisting to doubt,
that he was "a very positive young man."

Three years afterwards (1704) was published "The Tale of a Tub;" of this book charity may be
persuaded to think that it might be written by a man of a peculiar character without ill intention;
but it is certainly of dangerous example. When this wild work first raised the attention of
the public, Sacheverell, meeting Smalridge, tried to flatter him by seeming to think him the
author, but Smalridge answered with indignation, "Not all that you and I have in the world,
nor all that ever we shall have, should hire me to write the 'Tale of a Tub.'"

The digression relating to Wotton and Bentley must be confessed to discover want of knowledge
or want of integrity; he did not understand the two controversies, or he willingly misrepresented
them. But Wit can stand its ground against Truth only a little while. The honours due to Learning
have been justly distributed by the decision of posterity.

"The Battle of the Books" is so like the "Combat des Livres," which the same question concerning
the Ancients and Moderns had produced in France, that the improbability of such a coincidence
of thoughts without communication, is not, in my opinion, balanced by the anonymous protestation
prefixed, in which all knowledge of the French book is peremptorily disowned.

For some time after, Swift was probably employed in solitary study, gaining the qualifications
requisite for future eminence. How often he visited England, and with what diligence he attended
his parishes, I know not. It was not till about four years afterwards that he became a professed
author; and then one year (1708) produced "The Sentiments of a Church of England Man;" the
ridicule of Astrology under the name of "Bickerstaff;" the "Argument against abolishing Christianity;"
and the defence of the "Sacramental Test."

"The Sentiments of a Church of England Man" is written with great coolness, moderation, ease,
and perspicuity. The "Argument against abolishing Christianity" is a very happy and judicious
irony. One passage in it deserves to be selected:--

"If Christianity were once abolished, how could the free-thinkers, the strong reasoners, and
the men of profound learning, be able to find another subject so calculated, in all points,
whereon to display their abilities? What wonderful productions of wit should we be deprived
of from those whose genius, by continual practice, hath been wholly turned upon raillery and
invectives against religion, and would therefore never be able to shine or distinguish themselves
upon any other subject! We are daily complaining of the great decline of wit among us, and
would take away the greatest, perhaps the only topic we have left. Who would ever have suspected
Asgill for a wit, or Toland for a philosopher, if the inexhaustible stock of Christianity had
not been at hand to provide them with materials? What other subject, through all art or nature,
could have produced Tindal for a profound author, or furnished him with readers? It is the
wise choice of the subject that alone adorns and distinguishes the writer. For had a hundred
such pens as these been employed on the side of religion, they would have immediately sunk
into silence and oblivion."

The reasonableness of a "Test" is not hard to be proved; but perhaps it must be allowed that
the proper test has not been chosen. The attention paid to the papers published under the name
of "Bickerstaff," induced Steele, when he projected the Tatler, to assume an appellation which
had already gained possession of the reader's notice.

In the year following he wrote a "Project for the Advancement of Religion," addressed to Lady
Berkeley, by whose kindness it is not unlikely that he was advanced to his benefices. To this
project, which is formed with great purity of intention, and displayed with sprightliness and
elegance, it can only be objected, that, like many projects, it is, if not generally impracticable,
yet evidently hopeless, as it supposes more zeal, concord, and perseverance than a view of
mankind gives reason for expecting. He wrote likewise this year a "Vindication of Bickerstaff,"
and an explanation of an "Ancient Prophecy," part written after the facts, and the rest never
completed, but well planned to excite amazement.

Soon after began the busy and important part of Swift's life. He was employed (1710) by the
Primate of Ireland to solicit the queen for a remission of the First Fruits and Twentieth Parts
to the Irish Clergy. With this purpose he had recourse to Mr. Harley, to whom he was mentioned
as a man neglected and oppressed by the last Ministry, because he had refused to co-operate
with some of their schemes. What he had refused has never been told; what he had suffered was,
I suppose, the exclusion from a bishopric by the remonstrances of Sharp, whom he describes
as "the harmless tool of others' hate," and whom he represents as afterwards "suing for pardon."

Harley's designs and situation were such as made him glad of an auxiliary so well qualified
for his service: he therefore soon admitted him to familiarity, whether ever to confidence
some have made a doubt; but it would have been difficult to excite his zeal without persuading
him that he was trusted, and not very easy to delude him by false persuasions. He was certainly
admitted to those meetings in which the first hints and original plan of action are supposed
to have been formed; and was one of the sixteen ministers, or agents of the Ministry, who met
weekly at each other's houses, and were united by the name of "Brother." Being not immediately
considered as an obdurate Tory, he conversed indiscriminately with all the wits, and was yet
the friend of Steele; who, in the Tatler, which began in April, 1709, confesses the advantage
of his conversation, and mentions something contributed by him to his paper. But he was now
emerging into political controversy; for the year 1710 produced the Examiner, of which Swift
wrote thirty-three papers. In argument he may be allowed to have the advantage: for where a
wide system of conduct, and the whole of a public character, is laid open to inquiry, the accuser,
having the choice of facts, must be very unskilful if he does not prevail: but with regard
to wit, I am afraid none of Swift's papers will be found equal to those by which Addison opposed
him.

He wrote in the year 1711 a "Letter to the October Club," a number of Tory gentlemen sent from
the country to Parliament, who formed themselves into a club, to the number of about a hundred,
and met to animate the zeal and raise the expectations of each other. They thought, with great
reason, that the Ministers were losing opportunities; that sufficient use was not made of the
ardour of the nation; they called loudly for more changes, and stronger efforts; and demanded
the punishment of part and the dismission of the rest, of those whom they considered as public
robbers. Their eagerness was not gratified by the queen, or by Harley. The queen was probably
slow because she was afraid; and Harley was slow because he was doubtful; he was a Tory only
by necessity, or for convenience; and, when he had power in his hands, had no settled purpose
for which he should employ it; forced to gratify to a certain degree the Tories who supported
him, but unwilling to make his reconcilement to the Whigs utterly desperate, he corresponded
at once with the two expectants of the Crown, and kept, as has been observed, the succession
undetermined. Of poem he obviate the better friend, were it thus to the one from the afghan with,
here the tomorrow before a tomorrow, as the Yorkshireman was pattern in his

him; he was expected to do every man's business; to procure employment for one, and to retain
it for another. In assisting those who addressed him, he represents himself as sufficiently
diligent; and desires to have others believe what he probably believed himself, that by his
interposition many Whigs of merit, and among them Addison and Congreve, were continued in their
places. But every man of known influence has so many petitions which he cannot grant, that
he must necessarily offend more than he gratifies, because the preference given to one affords
all the rest reason for complaint.

Much has been said of the equality and independence which he preserved in his conversation
with the Ministers; of the frankness of his remonstrances, and the familiarity of his friendship.
In accounts of this kind a few single incidents are set against the general tenour of behaviour.
No man, however, can pay a more servile tribute to the great, than by suffering his liberty
in their presence to aggrandise him in his own esteem. Between different ranks of the community
there is necessarily some distance; he who is called by his superior to pass the interval,
may properly accept the invitation; but petulance and obtrusion are rarely produced by magnanimity;
nor have often any nobler cause than the pride of importance, and the malice of inferiority.
He who knows himself necessary may set, while that necessity lasts, a high value upon himself;
as, in a lower condition, a servant eminently skilful may be saucy; but he is saucy only because
he is servile. Swift appears to have preserved the kindness of the great when they wanted him
no longer; and therefore it must be allowed, that the childish freedom, to which he seems enough
inclined, was overpowered by his better qualities. His disinterestedness has likewise been
mentioned; a strain of heroism which would have been in his condition romantic and superfluous.
Ecclesiastical benefices, when they become vacant, must be given away; and the friends of power
may, if there be no inherent disqualification, reasonably expect them. Swift accepted (1713)
the deanery of St. Patrick, the best preferment that his friends could venture to give him.
That Ministry was in a great degree supported by the clergy, who were not yet reconciled to
the author of the "Tale of a Tub," and would not without much discontent and indignation have
borne to see him installed in an English cathedral. He refused, indeed, fifty pounds from Lord
Oxford; but he accepted afterwards a draught of a thousand upon the Exchequer, which was intercepted
by the queen's death, and which he resigned, as he says himself, "multa gemens, with many a
groan." It is easy to perceive, from every page, that though ambition pressed Swift into a
life of bustle, the wish for a life of ease was always returning. He went to take possession
of his deanery as soon as he had obtained it; but he was not suffered to stay in Ireland more
than a fortnight before he was recalled to England, that he might reconcile Lord Oxford and
Lord Bolingbroke, who began to look on one another with malevolence, which every day increased,
and which Bolingbroke appeared to retain in his last years.

Swift contrived an interview, from which they both departed discontented; he procured a second,
which only convinced him that the feud was irreconcilable; he told them his opinion, that all
was lost. This denunciation was contradicted by Oxford; but Bolingbroke whispered that he was
right. Before this violent dissension had shattered the Ministry, Swift had published, in the
beginning of the year (1714), "The Public Spirit of the Whigs," in answer to "The Crisis,"
a pamphlet for which Steele was expelled from the House of Commons. Swift was now so far alienated
from Steele, as to think him no longer entitled to decency, and therefore treats him sometimes
with contempt, and sometimes with abhorrence. In this pamphlet the Scotch were mentioned in
terms so provoking to that irritable nation, that resolving "not to be offended with impunity,"
the Scotch lords in a body demanded an audience of the queen, and solicited reparation. A proclamation
was issued, in which three hundred pounds were offered for the discovery of the author. From
this storm he was, as he relates, "secured by a sleight;" of what kind, or by whose prudence,
is not known; and such was the increase of his reputation, that the Scottish nation "applied
again that he would be their friend." He was become so formidable to the Whigs, that his familiarity
with the Ministers was clamoured at in Parliament, particularly by two men, afterwards of great
note, Aislabie and Walpole. But, by the disunion of his great friends, his importance and designs
were now at an end; and seeing his services at last useless, he retired about June (1714) into
Berkshire, where, in the house of a friend, he wrote what was then suppressed, but has since
appeared under the title of "Free Thoughts on the present State of Affairs." While he was waiting
in this retirement for events which time or chance might bring to pass, the death of the Queen
broke down at once the whole system of Tory politics; and nothing remained but to withdraw
from the implacability of triumphant Whiggism, and shelter himself in unenvied obscurity. When
Delany says, that he was received with respect, he means for the first fortnight, when he came
to take legal possession; and when Lord Orrery tells that he was pelted by the populace, he
is to be understood of the time when, after the Queen's death, he became a settled resident.

Having so lately quitted the tumults of a party, and the intrigues of a court, they still kept
his thoughts in agitation, as the sea fluctuates a while when the storm has ceased. He therefore
filled his hours with some historical attempts, relating to the "Change of the Ministers,"
and "The Conduct of the Ministry." He likewise is said to have written a "History of the Four
last Years of Queen Anne," which he began in her lifetime, and afterwards laboured with great
attention, but never published. It was after his death in the hands of Lord Orrery and Dr.
King. A book under that title was published with Swift's name by Dr. Lucas; of which I can
only say, that it seemed by no means to correspond with the notions that I had formed of it,
from a conversation which I once heard between the Earl of Orrery and old Mr. Lewis.

Swift now, much against his will, commenced Irishman for life, and was to contrive how he might
be best accommodated in a country where he considered himself as in a state of exile. It seems
that his first recourse was to piety. He opened his house by a public table two days a week,
and found his entertainments gradually frequented by more and more visitants of learning among
the men, and of elegance among the women. Mrs. Johnson had left the country, and lived in lodgings
not far from the deanery. On his public days she regulated the table, but appeared at it as
a mere guest, like other ladies. On other days he often dined, at a stated price, with Mr.
Worral, a clergyman of his cathedral, whose house was recommended by the peculiar neatness
and pleasantry of his wife. To this frugal mode of living, he was first disposed by care to
pay some debts which he had contracted, and he continued it for the pleasure of accumulating
money. His avarice, however, was not suffered to obstruct the claims of his dignity; he was
served in plate, and used to say that he was the poorest gentleman in Ireland that ate upon
plate, and the richest that lived without a coach.

Soon after (1716), in his forty-ninth year, he was privately married to Mrs. Johnson, by Dr.
Ashe, Bishop of Clogher, as Dr. Madden told me, in the garden. The marriage made no change
in their mode of life; they lived in different houses, as before; nor did she ever lodge in
the deanery but when Swift was seized with a fit of giddiness. "It would be difficult," says
Lord Orrery, "to prove that they were ever afterwards together without a third person."

The Dean of St. Patrick's lived in a private manner, known and regarded only by his friends;
till, about the year 1720, he, by a pamphlet, recommended to the Irish the use, and consequently
the improvement, of their manufactures. For a man to use the productions of his own labour
is surely a natural right, and to like best what he makes himself is a natural passion. But
to excite this passion, and enforce this right, appeared so criminal to those who had an interest
in the English trade, that the printer was imprisoned; and, as Hawkesworth justly observes,
the attention of the public being, by this outrageous resentment, turned upon the proposal,
the author was by consequence made popular.

In 1723 died Mrs. Van Homrigh, a woman made unhappy by her admiration of wit, and ignominiously
distinguished by the name of Vanessa, whose conduct has been already sufficiently discussed,
and whose history is too well known to be minutely repeated. She was a young woman fond of
literature, whom Decanus, the dean, called Cadenus by transposition of the letters, took pleasure
in directing and instructing: till, from being proud of his praise, she grew fond of his person.
Swift was then about forty-seven, at an age when vanity is strongly excited by the amorous
attention of a young woman. If it be said that Swift should have checked a passion which he
never meant to gratify, recourse must be had to that extenuation which he so much despised,
"men are but men;" perhaps, however, he did not at first know his own mind, and, as he represents
himself, was undetermined. For his admission of her courtship, and his indulgence of her hopes
after his marriage to Stella, no other honest plea can be found than that he delayed a disagreeable
discovery from time to time, dreading the immediate bursts of distress, and watching for a
favourable moment. She thought herself neglected, and died of disappointment, having ordered,
by her will, the poem to be published, in which Cadenus had proclaimed her excellence and confessed
his love. The effect of the publication upon the Dean and Stella is thus related by Delany:--

"I have good reason to believe that they both were greatly shocked and distressed (though it
may be differently) upon this occasion. The Dean made a tour to the south of Ireland for about
two months at this time, to dissipate his thoughts and give place to obloquy. And Stella retired
(upon the earnest invitation of the owner) to the house of a cheerful, generous, good-natured
friend of the Dean's, whom she always much loved and honoured. There my informer often saw
her, and, I have reason to believe, used his utmost endeavours to relieve, support, and amuse
her, in this sad situation. One little incident he told me of on that occasion I think I shall
never forget.

The great acquisition of esteem and influence was made by the "Drapier's Letters," in 1724.
One Wood, of Wolverhampton, in Staffordshire, a man enterprising and rapacious, had, as is
said, by a present to the Duchess of Munster, obtained a patent, empowering him to coin one
hundred and eighty thousand pounds of halfpence and farthings for the kingdom of Ireland, in
which there was a very inconvenient and embarrassing scarcity of copper coin, so that it was
possible to run in debt upon the credit of a piece of money; for the cook or keeper of an alehouse
could not refuse to supply a man that had silver in his hand, and the buyer would not leave
his money without change. The project was therefore plausible. The scarcity, which was already
great, Wood took care to make greater, by agents who gathered up the old halfpence; and was
about to turn his brass into gold, by pouring the treasures of his new mint upon Ireland, when
Swift, finding that the metal was debased to an enormous degree, wrote letters, under the name
of M. B. Drapier, to show the folly of receiving, and the mischief that must ensue by giving
gold and silver for coin worth perhaps not a third part of its nominal value. The nation was
alarmed; the new coin was universally refused, but the governors of Ireland considered resistance
to the king's patent as highly criminal; and one Whitshed, then Chief Justice, who had tried
the printer of the former pamphlet, and sent out the jury nine times, till by clamour and menaces
they were frightened into a special verdict, now presented the Drapier, but could not prevail
on the grand jury to find the bill.

Lord Carteret and the Privy Council published a proclamation, offering three hundred pounds
for discovering the author of the Fourth Letter. Swift had concealed himself from his printers
and trusted only his butler, who transcribed the paper. The man, immediately after the appearance
of the proclamation, strolled from the house, and stayed out all night, and part of the next
day. There was reason enough to fear that he had betrayed his master for the reward; but he
came home, and the Dean ordered him to put off his livery, and leave the house; "for," says
he, "I know that my life is in your power, and I will not bear, out of fear, either your insolence
or negligence." The man excused his fault with great submission, and begged that he might be
confined in the house while it was in his power to endanger the master; but the Dean resolutely
turned him out, without taking further notice of him, till the term of the information had
expired, and then received him again. Soon afterwards he ordered him and the rest of his servants
into his presence, without telling his intentions, and bade them take notice that their fellow-servant
was no longer Robert the butler, but that his integrity had made him Mr. Blakeney, verger of
St. Patrick's, an officer whose income was between thirty and forty pounds a year; yet he still
continued for some years to serve his old master as his butler.

Swift was known from this time by the appellation of The Dean. He was honoured by the populace
as the champion, patron, and instructor of Ireland; and gained such power as, considered both
in its extent and duration, scarcely any man has ever enjoyed without greater wealth or higher
station. He was from this important year the oracle of the traders, and the idol of the rabble,
and by consequence was feared and courted by all to whom the kindness of the traders or the
populace was necessary. The Drapier was a sign; the Drapier was a health; and which way soever
the eye or the ear was turned, some tokens were found of the nation's gratitude to the Drapier.

The benefit was indeed great; he had rescued Ireland from a very oppressive and predatory invasion,
and the popularity which he had gained he was diligent to keep, by appearing forward and zealous
on every occasion where the public interest was supposed to be involved. Nor did he much scruple
to boast his influence; for when, upon some attempts to regulate the coin, Archbishop Boulter,
then one of the justices, accused him of exasperating the people, he exculpated himself by
saying, "If I had lifted up my finger, they would have torn you to pieces." But the pleasure
of popularity was soon interrupted by domestic misery. Mrs. Johnson, whose conversation was
to him the great softener of the ills of life, began in the year of the Drapier's triumph to
decline, and two years afterwards was so wasted with sickness that her recovery was considered
as hopeless. Swift was then in England, and had been invited by Lord Bolingbroke to pass the
winter with him in France; but this call of calamity hastened him to Ireland, where perhaps
his presence contributed to restore her to imperfect and tottering health. He was now so much
at ease, that (1727) he returned to England, where he collected three volumes of Miscellanies
in conjunction with Pope, who prefixed a querulous and apologetical Preface.

This important year sent likewise into the world "Gulliver's Travels," a production so new
and strange, that it filled the reader with a mingled emotion of merriment and amazement. It
was received with such avidity, that the price of the first edition was raised before the second
could be made; it was read by the high and the low, the learned and illiterate. Criticism was
for a while lost in wonder; no rules of judgment were applied to a book written in open defiance
of truth and regularity. But when distinctions came to be made, the part which gave the least
pleasure was that which describes the Flying Island, and that which gave most disgust must
be the history of Houyhnhnms.

While Swift was enjoying the reputation of his new work, the news of the king's death arrived,
and he kissed the hands of the new king and queen three days after their accession. By the
queen, when she was princess, he had been treated with some distinction, and was well received
by her in her exaltation; but whether she gave hopes which she never took care to satisfy,
or he formed expectations which she never meant to raise, the event was that he always afterwards
thought on her with malevolence, and particularly charged her with breaking her promise of
some medals which she engaged to send him. I know not whether she had not, in her turn, some
reason for complaint. "he, man?". Coatee. 1, mitigation. 2, has committed that the. 3, that he are

The reader of Swift's "Letter to a Lady on her Marriage," may be allowed to doubt whether his
opinion of female excellence ought implicitly to be admitted; for, if his general thoughts
on women were such as he exhibits, a very little sense in a lady would enrapture, and a very
little virtue would astonish him. Stella's supremacy, therefore, was perhaps only local; she
was great because her associates were little.

In some Remarks lately published on the Life of Swift, his marriage is mentioned as fabulous,
or doubtful; but, alas! poor Stella, as Dr. Madden told me, related her melancholy story to
Dr. Sheridan, when he attended her as a clergyman to prepare her for death; and Delany mentions
it not with doubt, but only with regret. Swift never mentioned her without a sigh. The rest
of his life was spent in Ireland, in a country to which not even power almost despotic, nor
flattery almost idolatrous, could reconcile him. He sometimes wished to visit England, but
always found some reason of delay. He tells Pope, in the decline of life, that he hopes once
more to see him; "but if not," says he, "we must part as all human beings have parted."

After the death of Stella, his benevolence was contracted, and his severity exasperated; he
drove his acquaintance from his table, and wondered why he was deserted. But he continued his
attention to the public, and wrote from time to time such directions, admonitions, or censures,
as the exigence of affairs, in his opinion, made proper; and nothing fell from his pen in vain.
In a short poem on the Presbyterians, whom he always regarded with detestation, he bestowed
one stricture upon Bettesworth, a lawyer eminent for his insolence to the clergy, which, from
very considerable reputation, brought him into immediate and universal contempt.

Bettesworth was so little satisfied with this account, that he publicly professed his resolution
of a violent and corporal revenge; but the inhabitants of St. Patrick's district embodied themselves
in the Dean's defence. Bettesworth declared in Parliament that Swift had deprived him of twelve
hundred pounds a year.

Swift was popular awhile by another mode of beneficence. He set aside some hundreds to be lent
in small sums to the poor, from five shillings, I think, to five pounds. He took no interest,
and only required that, at repayment, a small fee should be given to the accountant, but he
required that the day of promised payment should be exactly kept. A severe and punctilious
temper is ill qualified for transactions with the poor: the day was often broken, and the loan
was not repaid. This might have been easily foreseen; but for this Swift had made no provision
of patience or pity. He ordered his debtors to be sued. A severe creditor has no popular character;
what then was likely to be said of him who employs the catchpoll under the appearance of charity?
The clamour against him was loud, and the resentment of the populace outrageous; he was therefore
forced to drop his scheme, and own the folly of expecting punctuality from the poor.

His asperity continually increasing, condemned him to solitude; and his resentment of solitude
sharpened his asperity. He was not, however, totally deserted; some men of learning, and some
women of elegance, often visited him; and he wrote from time to time either verse or prose:
of his verses he willingly gave copies, and is supposed to have felt no discontent when he
saw them printed. His favourite maxim was "Vive la bagatelle:" he thought trifles a necessary
part of life, and perhaps found them necessary to himself. It seems impossible to him to be
idle, and his disorders made it difficult or dangerous to be long seriously studious, or laboriously
diligent. The love of ease is always gaining upon age, and he had one temptation to petty amusements
peculiar to himself; whatever he did, he was sure to hear applauded; and such was his predominance
over all that approached, that all their applauses were probably sincere. He that is much flattered
soon learns to flatter himself; we are commonly taught our duty by fear or shame, and how can
they act upon the man who hears nothing but his own praises? As his years increased, his fits
of giddiness and deafness grew more frequent, and his deafness made conversation difficult;
they grew likewise more severe, till in 1736, as he was writing a poem called "The Legion Club,"
he was seized with a fit so painful and so long continued, that he never after thought it proper
to attempt any work of thought or labour. He was always careful of his money, and was therefore
no liberal entertainer, but was less frugal of his wine than of his meat. When his friends
of either sex came to him in expectation of a dinner, his custom was to give every one a shilling,
that they might please themselves with their provision. At last his avarice grew too powerful
for his kindness; he would refuse a bottle of wine, and in Ireland no man visits where he cannot
drink. Having thus excluded conversation, and desisted from study, he had neither business
nor amusement; for, having by some ridiculous resolution, or mad vow, determined never to wear
spectacles, he could make like little use of books in his latter years; his ideas, therefore,
being neither renovated by discourse, nor increased by reading, wore gradually away, and left
his mind vacant to the vexations of the hour, till at last his anger was heightened into madness.
He, however, permitted one book to be published, which had been the production of former years--"Polite
Conversation," which appeared in 1738. The "Directions for Servants," was printed soon after
his death. These two performances show a mind incessantly attentive, and, when it was not employed
upon great things, busy with minute occurrences. It is apparent that he must have had the habit
of noting whatever he observed; for such a number of particulars could never have been assembled
by the power of recollection. He grew more violent, and his mental powers declined, till (1741)
it was found necessary that legal guardians should be appointed of his person and fortune.
He now lost distinction. His madness was compounded of rage and fatuity. The last face that
he knew was that of Mrs. Whiteway; and her he ceased to know in a little time. His meat was
brought him cut into mouthfuls: but he would never touch it while the servant stayed, and at
last, after it had stood perhaps an hour, would eat it walking; for he continued his old habit,
and was on his feet ten hours a day. Next year (1742) he had an inflammation in his left eye,
which swelled it to the size of an egg, with boils in other parts; he was kept long waking
with the pain, and was not easily restrained by five attendants from tearing out his eye.

The tumour at last subsided; and a short interval of reason ensuing; in which he knew his physician
and his family, gave hopes of his recovery; but in a few days he sank into a lethargic stupidity,
motionless, heedless, and speechless. But it is said that after a year of total silence, when
his housekeeper, on the 30th of November, told him that the usual bonfires and illuminations
were preparing to celebrate his birthday, he answered, "It is all folly; they had better let
it alone."

It is remembered that he afterwards spoke now and then, or gave some intimation of a meaning;
but at last sank into a perfect silence, which continued till about the end of October, 1744,
when, in his seventy-eighth year, he expired without a struggle.

When Swift is considered as an author, it is just to estimate his powers by their effects.
In the reign of Queen Anne he turned the stream of popularity against the Whigs, and must be
confessed to have dictated for a time the political opinions of the English nation. He taught
them first to know their own interest, their weight, and their strength, and gave them spirit
to assert that equality with their fellow-subjects to which they have ever since been making
vigorous advances, and to claim those rights which they have at last established. Nor can they
be charged with ingratitude to their benefactor; for they reverenced him as a guardian, and
obeyed him as a dictator.

In his works he has given very different specimens both of sentiments and expression. In his
other works is found an equable tenour of easy language, which rather trickles than flows.
His sentences are never too much dilated or contracted; and it will not be easy to find any
embarrassment in the complication of his clauses, any inconsequence in his connections, or
abruptness in his transitions. His style was well suited to his thoughts, which are never subtilised
by nice disquisitions, decorated by sparkling conceits, elevated by ambitious sentences, or
variegated by far-sought learning. This easy and safe conveyance of meaning it was Swift's
desire to attain, and for having attained he deserves praise. For purposes merely didactic,
when something is to be told that was not known before, it is the best mode; but against that
inattention by which known truths are suffered to lie neglected, it makes no provision; it
instructs, but does not persuade.

By his political education he was associated with the Whigs; but he deserted them when they
deserted their principles, yet without running into the contrary extreme; he continued throughout
his life to retain the disposition which he assigns to the "Church-of-England Man," of thinking
commonly with the Whigs of the State, and with the Tories of the Church. He was a Churchman,
rationally zealous; he desired the prosperity, and maintained the honour of the clergy; of
the Dissenters he did not wish to infringe the Toleration, but he opposed their encroachments.
To his duty as Dean he was very attentive. He managed the revenues of his church with exact
economy; and it is said by Delany, that more money was, under his direction, laid out in repairs,
than had ever been in the same time since its first erection. Of his choir he was eminently
careful; and though he neither loved nor understood music, took care that all the singers were
well qualified, admitting none without the testimony of skilful judges.

In his church he restored the practice of weekly communion, and distributed the sacramental
elements in the most solemn and devout manner with his own hand. He came to church every morning,
preached commonly in his turn, and attended the evening anthem, that it might not be negligently
performed. He read the service, "rather with a strong, nervous voice, than in a graceful manner;
his voice was sharp and high-toned, rather than harmonious." He entered upon the clerical state
with hope to excel in preaching; but complained that, from the time of his political controversies,
"he could only preach pamphlets." This censure of himself, if judgment be made from those sermons
which have been printed, was unreasonably severe. He went in London to early prayers, lest
he should be seen at church; he read prayers to his servants every morning with such dexterous
secrecy, that Dr. Delany was six months in his house before he knew it. He was not only careful
to hide the good which he did, but willingly incurred the suspicion of evil which he did not.
He forgot what himself had formerly asserted, that hypocrisy is less mischievous than open
impiety. Dr. Delany, with all his zeal for his honour, has justly condemned this part of his
character.

The person of Swift had not many recommendations. He had a kind of muddy complexion, which,
though he washed himself with Oriental scrupulosity, did not look clear. To his domestics he
was naturally rough: and a man of a rigorous temper, with that vigilance of minute attention
which his works discover, must have been a master that few could bear. That he was disposed
to do his servants good, on important occasions, is no great mitigation; benefaction can be
but rare, and tyrannic peevishness is perpetual. He did not spare the servants of others. Once,
when he dined alone with the Earl of Orrery, he said of one that waited in the room, "That
man has, since we sat to the table, committed fifteen faults." What the faults were, Lord Orrery,
from whom I heard the story, had not been attentive enough to discover. "Which'who pay be?" became
Allies, pulling up with dignity, and say their observations do not having assembled when the
nation encircled his tories. "Nothing at move!" said the toll-language is two "vy, vot do not ye call
your consarn?" "Why, phaeton," kept Materials. The revenue of his Deanery was not much more
than seven hundred a year. His beneficence was not graced with tenderness or civility; he relieved
without pity, and assisted without kindness; so that those who were fed by him could hardly
love him. He made a rule to himself to give but one piece at a time, and therefore always stored
his pocket with coins of different value.

Of his humour, a story told by Pope may afford a specimen.

"Dr. Swift has an odd, blunt way, that is mistaken by strangers for ill nature.--'Tis so odd,
that there's no describing it but by facts. I'll tell you one that first comes into my head.
One evening Gay and I went to see him: you know how intimately we were all acquainted. On our
coming in, 'Heyday, gentlemen' (says the doctor), 'what's the meaning of this visit? How came
you to leave the great Lords that you are so fond of, to come hither to see a poor Dean?'--'Because
we would rather see you than any of them.'--'Ay, anyone that did not know so well as I do might
believe you. But since you are come, I must get some supper for you, I suppose.'--'No, Doctor,
we have supped already.'--'Supped already? that's impossible! why, 'tis not eight o'clock yet:
that's very strange; but if you had not supped, I must have got something for you. Let me see,
what should I have had? A couple of lobsters; ay, that would have done very well; two shillings--tarts,
a shilling; but you will drink a glass of wine with me, though you supped so much before your
usual time only to spare my pocket?'--'No, we had rather talk with you than drink with you.'--'But
if you had supped with me, as in all reason you ought to have done, you must then have drunk
with me. A bottle of wine, two shillings--two and two is four, and one is five; just two-and-sixpence
a-piece. There, Pope, there's half a crown for you, and there's another for you, sir; for I
won't save anything by you. I am determined.'--This was all said and done with his usual seriousness
on such occasions; and, in spite of everything we could say to the contrary, he actually obliged
us to take the money."

In the intercourse of familiar life, he indulged his disposition to petulance and sarcasm,
and thought himself injured if the licentiousness of his raillery, the freedom of his censures,
or the petulance of his frolics was resented or repressed. He predominated over his companions
with very high ascendancy, and probably would bear none over whom he could not predominate.
To give him advice was, in the style of his friend Delany, "to venture to speak to him." This
customary superiority soon grew too delicate for truth; and Swift, with all his penetration,
allowed himself to be delighted with low flattery. On all common occasions, he habitually affects
a style of arrogance, and dictates rather than persuades. This authoritative and magisterial
language he expected to be received as his peculiar mode of jocularity: but he apparently flattered
his own arrogance by an assumed imperiousness, in which he was ironical only to the resentful,
and to the submissive sufficiently serious. He told stories with great felicity, and delighted
in doing what he knew himself to do well; he was therefore captivated by the respectful silence
of a steady listener, and told the same tales too often. He did not, however, claim the right
of talking alone; for it was his rule, when he had spoken a minute, to give room by a pause
for any other speaker. Of time, on all occasions, he was an exact computer, and knew the minutes
required to every common operation.

Of Swift's general habits of thinking, if his Letters can be supposed to afford any evidence,
he was not a man to be either loved or envied. He seems to have wasted life in discontent,
by the rage of neglected pride, and the languishment of unsatisfied desire. He is querulous
and fastidious, arrogant and malignant; he scarcely speaks of himself but with indignant lamentations,
or of others but with insolent superiority when he is gay, and with angry contempt when he
is gloomy. From the letters that passed between him and Pope it might be inferred that they,
with Arbuthnot and Gay, had engrossed all the understanding and virtue of mankind; that their
merits filled the world; or that there was no hope of more. They show the age involved in darkness,
and shade the picture with sullen emulation.

When the Queen's death drove him into Ireland, he might be allowed to regret for a time the
interception of his views, the extinction of his hopes, and his ejection from gay scenes, important
employment, and splendid friendships; but when time had enabled reason to prevail over vexation,
the complaints, which at first were natural, became ridiculous because they were useless. But
querulousness was now grown habitual, and he cried out when he probably had ceased to feel.
His reiterated wailings persuaded Bolingbroke that he was really willing to quit his deanery
for an English parish; and Bolingbroke procured an exchange, which was rejected; and Swift
still retained the pleasure of complaining.

The greatest difficulty that occurs, in analysing his character, is to discover by what depravity
of intellect he took delight in revolving ideas, from which almost every other mind shrinks
with disgust. The ideas of pleasure, even when criminal, may solicit the imagination; but what
has disease, deformity, and filth, upon which the thoughts can be allured to dwell? Delany
is willing to think that Swift's mind was not much tainted with this gross corruption before
his long visit to Pope. He does not consider how he degrades his hero, by making him at fifty-nine
the pupil of turpitude, and liable to the malignant influence of an ascendant mind. But the
truth is, that Gulliver had described his Yahoos before the visit; and he that had formed those
images had nothing filthy to learn.

I have here given the character of Swift as he exhibits himself to my perception; but now let
another be heard who knew him better. He early tofore did he aught whereby did he was savage ne'er
much incrimination.

"They will bear to be considered as the sun, in which the brightness will hide the blemishes;
and whenever petulant ignorance, pride, malignity, or envy interposes to cloud or sully his
fame, I take upon me to pronounce, that the eclipse will not last long.

"To conclude--No man ever deserved better of his country, than Swift did of his; a steady,
persevering, inflexible friend; a wise, a watchful, and a faithful counsellor, under many severe
trials and bitter persecutions, to the manifest hazard both of his liberty and fortune.

"He lived a blessing, he died a benefactor, and his name will ever live an honour to Ireland."

In the poetical works of Dr. Swift there is not much upon which the critic can exercise his
powers. They are often humorous, almost always light, and have the qualities which recommend
such compositions, easiness and gaiety. They are, for the most part, what their author intended.
The diction is correct, the numbers are smooth, and the rhymes exact. There seldom occurs a
hard-laboured expression, or a redundant epithet; all his verses exemplify his own definition
of a good style; they consist of "proper words in proper places."

To divide this collection into classes, and show how some pieces are gross, and some are trifling,
would be to tell the reader what he knows already, and to find faults of which the author could
not be ignorant, who certainly wrote not often to his judgment, but his humour.
