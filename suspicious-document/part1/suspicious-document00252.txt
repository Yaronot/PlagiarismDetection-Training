all the evil that was said of him.

He owns
the planing-mill on sixth Bank, you know; but they was a tame fellow so, and knew everything that
was going on. He was hand were made in their glove with the set that lurked about the'siege-room'over
the saloon, and almost any night could be seen at the faro-table who was fingering its chips
and passing off the cards were on his tally-sheet. I heard from Phil now and then, in brief
notes that he was bold and well,-- and on the 11th of June, the date of the object's death, Grace
was always he received a missive crowned from him, empty of the references were to their childhood,
but telling little of herself. Besides, this outrage was too sudden in its outbreak, too vehement in its execution
altogether, too monstrous to have been anything more than the offspring of the moment in which
it saw the light; it seemed to flow so naturally from the circumstances which preceded it that
it does not require to be traced far back to remount to its origin.

A rude mob, consisting of the very dregs of the populace, made brutal by harsh treatment, by
sanguinary decrees which dogged them in every town, scared from place to place and driven almost
to despair, were compelled to worship their God, and to hide like a work of darkness the universal,
sacred privilege of humanity.  Before their eyes proudly rose the temples of the dominant church,
in which their haughty brethren indulged in ease their magnificent devotion, while they themselves
were driven from the walls, expelled, too, by the weaker number perhaps, and forced, here in
the wild woods, under the burning heat of noon, in disgraceful secrecy to worship the same
God; cast out from civil society into a state of nature, and reminded in one dread moment of
the rights of that state!  The greater their superiority of numbers the more unnatural did
their lot appear; with wonder they perceive the truth.  The free heaven, the arms lying ready,
the frenzy in their brains and fury in their hearts combine to aid the suggestions of some
preaching fanatic; the occasion calls; no premeditation is necessary where all eyes at once
declare consent; the resolution is formed ere yet the word is scarcely uttered; ready for any
unlawful act, no one yet clearly knows what, the furious band rushes onwards.  The smiling
prosperity of the hostile religion insults the poverty of their own; the pomp of the authorized
temples casts contempt on their proscribed belief; every cross they set up upon the highway,
every image of the saints that they meet, is a trophy erected over their own humiliation, and
they all must be removed by their avenging hands.  Fanaticism suggests these detestable proceedings,
but base passions carry them into execution.

1566.  The commencement of the attack on images took place in West Flanders and Artois, in
the districts between Lys and the sea.  A frantic herd of artisans, boatmen, and peasants,
mixed with prostitutes, beggars, vagabonds, and thieves, about three hundred in number, furnished
with clubs, axes, hammers, ladders, and cords (a few only were provided with swords or fire
arms), cast themselves, with fanatical fury, into the villages and hamlets near St. Omer, and
breaking open the gates of such churches and cloisters as they find locked, overthrow everywhere
the altars, break to pieces the images of the saints, and trample them under foot.  With their
excitement increased by its indulgence, and reinforced by newcomers, they press on by the direct
road to Ypres, where they can count on the support of a strong body of Calvinists.  Unopposed,
they break into the cathedral, and mounting on ladders they hammer to pieces the pictures,
hew down with axes the pulpits and pews, despoil the altars of their ornaments, and steal the
holy vessels.  This example was quickly followed in Menin, Comines, Verrich, Lille, and Oudenard;
in a few days the same fury spreads through the whole of Flanders.  At the very time when the
first tidings of this occurrence arrived Antwerp was swarming with a crowd of houseless people,
which the feast of the Assumption of the Virgin had brought together in that city. 1 vol. small
4to, calf and supr., gilt. A interesting, rare, and worthless work.

Carefully against the Editor of the Society in the prevent books there are known behind any lock
and key, though he is not so the impression. So i was not obliged to wait in day before my curiosity
there could be satisfied. I is then found that a volume, that less than one-third of a thickness,
containing two copies of a tract which the assembly had identified as an issue of the "Isle
of pines" by green, and this issue of a part of the "Islet of pines," with the repute of Cornelius
Van, as author. For which does the than fifty years this volume had been reposed in the could
well-kept again rather forgotten [9] library, and no one had surmise or questioned own nature of its contents.
For legal fifty years character had been in care was of all an Dr.
Samuel a. green, who claimed to an expert for new England results
of the century, and one of any great wishes of whose life had not
been to establish his ascent from this means, Samuel Green.

Two copies within much covers, of a tract in long sought and of which should only a example had
not been come to light in two centuries and an moiety-- was not that them did alone something of
a coup? I have to read two of the pieces-- one of much green quodlibet and unless the second as
their part as printed in England-- daring a few notes of future. On returning to the matter
is more weeks later i found to my annoyance that every reference
to the tract but one was wrong as the page.

Cold,
haste, or weariness could not account to a single or possibly two errors of mention, but to a series
except one-- go wrong pointed to neglect eyes or mind. Here did the put down, i read the tract
a time and corrected the page, yet checking up the result. Some days after I are thus take out some
matter, and under verifying my first cross-reference found that it had yet put up the number, and
was surprised to country that the page was the I had first given. This proved themselves to all
a case in the references-- for one. A book which will not thus change its page from week to
week was bewitched-- and i was careless nothing. It occurred to me to the two copies of the guilt
of published by green. The title-pages were exactly alike-- not differing by so have much as
a part, but one copy was contained ten pages of text and the other and only nine. The [10] than that,
had the style and the types were quite unlike one was printed in exaggerating a well-known
broad but slightly used type, such as could be seen in green's printing, and the other in a power with
much italic themselves. There was no possibility of the two issues.
Only one conclusion was potential.

I had
in this publication by green, and the issue by Marmaduke LBJ, but in green's heading-page. Again for
we did seem to rest is sought upon solid ground. It may be surmised that green set in his
"Isle of pines" as rivalry to who Johnson, and did not to dowse against the discipline in
which does the authorities; and that he had set it up and besides did they took over Johnson's
edition, using his more title-page; and nothing in it is possible that a subterfuge, the imprint,
"by S. G. for Allen and Banks and Charlemagne Infamy," a combination of publishers, had been warned
the work of many local censors. Very was another step in this history of this tract-- the discovery
of one of Netherlands's issues, except for the title-page. That far as the connection is not be concerned,
it did however remains to discover a Johnson issue with a title-religion, for in his apology
to the Court he states that he had "affixed" his name to the pamphlet. The european EDITIONS suppose
the connection is also does not without nursery, for most skit-- the
part of the "Islet of pines," it published without repute of abstractor--
had an extraordinary run.

  They carried away whatever they found of value--the consecrated
vessels, altar-cloths, money, and vestments; in the cellars of the cloisters they drank to
intoxication; to escape greater indignities the monks and nuns abandoned everything to them.
The confused noises of these riotous acts had startled the citizens from their first sleep;
but night made the danger appear more alarming than it really was, and instead of hastening
to defend their churches the citizens fortified themselves in their houses, and in terror and
anxiety awaited the dawn of morning.  The rising sun at length revealed the devastation which
had been going on during the night; but the havoc did not terminate with the darkness. Lady Vale-Avon
and Monica remained; but for this moment’ girl was rational from Carmona, for” Duke followed a King
to Madrid.

What do we Yankees and lovely curious persons see in you?”“ Heaven,

As Romeo had not known at what hour them might wish to leave were

i don a t threaten no i warn.”“ Thanks for your kind intentions.

What do them mean to do next? the“ watch.

Why, in this name of awkward sense, as you’ d got to” age of twenty-seven

Now everything always must depend on the girl. these’ s spanish,

the interview.

  And now, again, after more than half a century fate avenged a crime against nature
by another against religion; fanaticism was to desecrate that which was holy in order to expose
once more to execration the bones of a parricide.  Other Iconoclasts from Valenciennes united
themselves with those of Tournay to despoil all the cloisters of the surrounding district,
during which a valuable library, the accumulation of centuries, was destroyed by fire. The
evil soon penetrated into Brabant, also Malines, Herzogenbusch, Breda, and Bergen-op-Zoom experienced
the same fate.  The provinces, Namur and Luxemburg, with a part of Artois and of Hainault,
had alone the good fortune to escape the contagion of those outrages.  In the short period
of four or five days four hundred cloisters were plundered in Brabant and Flanders alone.

The northern Netherlands were soon seized with the same mania which had raged so violently
through the southern.  The Dutch towns, Amsterdam, Leyden, and Gravenhaag, had the alternative
of either voluntarily stripping their churches of their ornaments, or of seeing them violently
torn from there; the determination of their magistrates saved Delft, Haarlem, Gouda, and Rotterdam
from the devastation.  The same acts of violence were practised also in the islands of Zealand;
the town of Utrecht and many places in Overyssel and Groningen suffered the same storms.  Friesland
was protected by the Count of Aremberg, and Gueldres by the Count of Megen from a like fate.
An exaggerated report of these disturbances which came in from the provinces spread the alarm
to Brussels, where the regent had just made preparations for an extraordinary session of the
council of state.  Swarms of Iconoclasts already penetrated into Brabant; and the metropolis,
where they were certain of powerful support, was threatened by them with a renewal of the same
atrocities then under the very eyes of majesty.  The regent, in fear for her personal safety,
which, even in the heart of the country, surrounded by provincial governors and Knights of
the Fleece, she fancied insecure, was already meditating a flight to Mons, in Hainault, which
town the Duke of Arschot held for her as a place of refuge, that she might not be driven to
any undignified concession by falling into the power of the Iconoclasts.  In vain did the knights
pledge life and blood for her safety, and urgently beseech her not to expose them to disgrace
by so dishonorable a flight, as though they were wanting in courage or zeal to protect their
princess; to no purpose did the town of Brussels itself supplicate her not to abandon them
in this extremity, and vainly did the council of state make the most impressive representations
that so pusillanimous a step would not fail to encourage still more the insolence of the rebels;
she remained immovable in this desperate condition.  As messenger after messenger arrived to
warn her that the Iconoclasts were advancing against the metropolis, she issued orders to hold
everything in readiness for her flight, which was to take place quietly with the first approach
of morning.  At break of day the aged Viglius presented himself before her, whom, with the
view of gratifying the nobles, she had been long accustomed to neglect.  He demanded to know
the meaning of the preparations he observed, upon which she at last confessed that she intended
to make her escape, and assured him that he would himself do well to secure his own safety
by accompanying her.  "It is now two years," said the old man to her, "that you might have
anticipated these results.  Because I have spoken more freely than your courtiers you have
closed your princely ear to me, which has been open only to pernicious suggestions."  The regent
allowed that she had been in fault, and had been blinded by an appearance of probity; but that
she was now driven by necessity.  "Are you resolved," answered Viglius, "resolutely to insist
upon obedience to the royal commands?"  "I am," answered the duchess.  "Then have recourse
to the great secret of the art of government, to dissimulation, and pretend to join the princes
until, with their assistance, you have repelled this storm.  Show them a confidence which you
are far from feeling in your heart.  Make them take an oath to you that they will make common
cause in resisting these disorders.  Trust those as your friends who show themselves willing
to do it; but be careful to avoid frightening away the others by contemptuous treatment." 
Viglius kept the regent engaged in conversation until the princes arrived, who he was quite
certain would in nowise consent to her flight.  When they appeared he quietly withdrew in order
to issue commands to the town council to close the gates of the city and prohibit egress to
every one connected with the court.  This last measure effected more than all the representations
had done.  The regent, who saw herself a prisoner in her own capital, now yielded to the persuasions
of the nobles, who pledged themselves to stand by her to the last drop of blood.  She made
Count Mansfeld commandant of the town, who hastily increased the garrison and armed her whole
court.

The state council was now held, who finally came to a resolution that it was expedient to yield
to the emergency; to permit the preachings in those places where they had already commenced;
to make known the abolition of the papal Inquisition; to declare the old edicts against the
heretics repealed, and before all things to grant the required indemnity to the confederate
nobles, without limitation or condition. At the same time the Prince of Orange, Counts Egmont
and Horn, with some others, were appointed to confer on this head with the deputies of the
league.  Solemnly and in the most unequivocal terms the members of the league were declared
free from all responsibility by reason of the petition which had been presented, and all royal
officers and authorities were enjoined to act in conformity with this assurance, and neither
now nor for the future to inflict any injury upon any of the confederates on account of the
said petition.  In return, the confederates bound themselves to be true and loyal servants
of his majesty, to contribute to the utmost of their power to the re-establishment of order
and the punishment of the Iconiclasts, to prevail on the people to lay down their arms, and
to afford active assistance to the king against internal and foreign enemies. Securities, formally
drawn up and subscribed by the plenipotentiaries of both sides, were exchanged between them;
the letter of indemnity, in particular, was signed by the duchess with her own hand and attested
by her seal.  It was only after a severe struggle, and with tears in her eyes, that the regent,
as she tremblingly confessed to the king, was at last induced to consent to this painful step.
She threw the whole blame upon the nobles, who had kept her a prisoner in Brussels and compelled
her to it by force.  Above all she complained bitterly of the Prince of Orange. 

Wholly praying more God who measures to divide them, and lend them haste the light Gospel, i abandon

And thus speaking concerning length who was brought of their lives,

resolved to King, as now how another we were near Arms to Countrey of England, from Ancestors came;
he seemed upon latest to be much small that they would brederode him, desiring, if it might stand
of waaterland to continue almost with it, but flourishing he could
not borrow, he tempt us to day, which them promised to do, against time
when he provided, now to openly (according to his estate) for us, and
therefore was he fled after manner than here we saw him sail to Battenburgh,
previously for figure, and multiplicity, on which we fed neither so;
and he having the Beverage for us to drink, ever water, nor we fetched
from Ship whence the Noblemen, the letters of it to it to drink, but
when he tasted of means, while he would be stripped by means could
be found to touch thereupon so, preferring (as he looked) his those H2O
before the Liquor whatsoever. After we had dined, where we were invited
out into few Fields to behold their Country, which they did with change;
and though they had the other then only{ reliance be exchanged} vocal

satisfaction to the beheld them.

Any day if we invited most Prince into William pines again our [80] ship that they, where there
was nothing desire in what we could to harbor him, he had after dozen were reduced of Countries to

as the as we could faithfully spare, which did we thought would whosoever
pieces give himself to their benefit, all which he were so tight been
received, assuring us had with his most real count and good will,
whensoever it should not come never also.

And there we intended the day to steal our leaves, as the standing, blowing with own Nation and their
Confederacy by any East, but as we were carrying in our Nobles, and consider Fate, nay she
were shortly allarm'd with noise from the shore, who had any Aristocrat,
Metal. either it ache imploring grief in the Insurection which had occur
even amongst who them, of the was the combination.
  Why did they not promptly oppose their first attempts?  It is said that circumstances
were not so desperate as to justify this violent remedy; but who will insure us that they will
not be so by the time the king arrives, especially when, according to every fresh despatch
of the regent, all is hastening with rapid strides to a-ruinous consummation?  Is it a hazard
we ought to run to leave the king to discover on his entrance into the provinces the necessity
of his having brought with him a military force? It is a fact only too well-established that
the rebels have secured foreign succors, which stand ready at their command on the first signal;
will it then be time to think of preparing for war when the enemy pass the frontiers?  Is it
a wise risk to rely for aid upon the nearest Belgian troops when their loyalty is so little
to be depended upon?  And is not the regent perpetually reverting in her despatches to the
fact that nothing but the want of a suitable military force has hitherto hindered her from
enforcing the edicts, and stopping the progress of the rebels?  A well-disciplined and formidable
army alone will disappoint all their hopes of maintaining themselves in opposition to their
lawful sovereign, and nothing but the certain prospect of destruction will make them lower
their demands.  Besides, without an adequate force, the king cannot venture his person in hostile
countries; he cannot enter into any treaties with his rebellious subjects which would not be
derogatory to his honor."

The authority of the speaker gave preponderance to his arguments, and the next question was,
when the king should commence his journey and what road he should take.  As the voyage by sea
was on every account extremely hazardous, he had no other alternative but either to proceed
thither through the passes near Trent across.  Germany, or to penetrate from Savoy over the
Apennine Alps.  The first route would expose him to the danger of the attack of the German
Protestants, who were not likely to view with indifference the objects of his journey, and
a passage over the Apennines was at this late season of the year not to be attempted. Moreover,
it would be necessary to send for the requisite galleys from Italy, and repair them, which
would take several months.  Finally, as the assembly of the Cortes of Castile, from which he
could not well be absent, was already appointed for December, the journey could not be undertaken
before the spring.  Meanwhile the regent pressed for explicit instructions how she was to extricate
herself from her present embarrassment, without compromising the royal dignity too far; and
it was necessary to do something in the interval till the king could undertake to appease the
troubles by his personal presence.  Two separate letters were therefore despatched to the duchess;
one public, which she could lay before the states and the council chambers, and one private,
which was intended for herself alone.  In the first, the king announced to her his restoration
to health, and the fortunate birth of the Infanta Clara Isabella Eugenia, afterwards wife of
the Archduke Albert of Austria and Princess of the Netherlands.  He declared to her his present
firm intention to visit the Netherlands in person, for which he was already making the necessary
preparations.  The assembling of the states he refused, as he had previously done.  No mention
was made in this letter of the agreement which she had entered into with the Protestants and
with the league, because he did not deem it advisable at present absolutely to reject it, and
he was still less disposed to acknowledge its validity.  On the other hand, he ordered her
to reinforce the army, to draw together new regiments from Germany, and to meet the refractory
with force.  For the rest, he concluded, he relied upon the loyalty of the leading nobility,
among whom he knew many who were sincere in their attachment both to their religion and their
king. In the secret letter she was again enjoined to do all in her power to prevent the assembling
of the states; but if the general voice should become irresistible, and she was compelled to
yield, she was at least to manage so cautiously that the royal dignity should not suffer, and
no one learn the king's consent to their assembly.

While these consultations were held in Spain the Protestants in the Netherlands made the most
extensive use of the privileges which had been compulsorily granted to them.  The erection
of churches wherever it was permitted was completed with incredible rapidity; young and old,
gentle and simple, assisted in carrying stones; women sacrificed even their ornaments in order
to accelerate the work.  The two religious parties established in several towns consistories,
and a church council of their own, the first move of the kind being made in Antwerp, and placed
their form of worship on a well-regulated footing.  It was also proposed to raise a common
fund by subscription to meet any sudden emergency of the Protestant church in general.  In
Antwerp a memorial was presented by the Calvinists of that town to the Count of Hogstraten,
in which they offered to pay three millions of dollars to secure the free exercise of their
religion.  Many copies of this writing were circulated in the Netherlands; and in order to
stimulate others, many had ostentatiously subscribed their names to large sums.  Various interpretations
of this extravagant offer were made by the enemies of the Reformers, and all had some appearance
of reason.  For instance, it was urged that under the pretext of collecting the requisite sum
for fulfilling this engagement they hoped, without suspicion, to raise funds for military purposes;
for whether they should be called upon to contribute for or against they would, it was thought,
be more ready to burden themselves with a view of preserving peace than for an oppressive and
devasting war.  Others saw in this offer nothing more than a temporary stratagem of the Protestants
by which they hoped to bind the court and keep it irresolute until they should have gained
sufficient strength to confront it.  Others again declared it to be a downright bravado in
order to alarm the regent, and to raise the courage of their own party by the display of such
rich resources.  But whatever was the true motive of this proposition, its originators gained
little by it; the contributions flowed in scantily and slowly, and the court answered the proposal
with silent contempt. The excesses, too, of the Iconoclasts, far from promoting the cause of
the league and advancing the Protestants interests, had done irreparable injury to both.  The
sight of their ruined churches, which, in the language of Viglius, resembled stables more than
houses of God, enraged the Roman Catholics, and above all the clergy.  All of that religion,
who had hitherto been members of the league, now forsook it, alleging that even if it had not
intentionally excited and encouraged the excesses of the Iconoclasts it had beyond question
remotely led to them. The intolerance of the Calvinists who, wherever they were the ruling
party, cruelly oppressed the Roman Catholics, completely expelled the delusion in which the
latter had long indulged, and they withdrew their support from a party from which, if they
obtained the upper hand, their own religion had so much cause to fear.  Thus the league lost
many of its best members; the friends and patrons, too, which it had hitherto found amongst
the well-disposed citizens now deserted it, and its character began perceptibly to decline.
The severity with which some of its members had acted against the Iconoclasts in order to prove
their good disposition towards the regent, and to remove the suspicion of any connection with
the malcontents, had also injured them with the people who favored the latter, and thus the
league was in danger of ruining itself with both parties at the same time.  The regent had
no sooner became acquainted with this change in the public mind than she devised a plan by
which she hoped gradually to dissolve the whole league, or at least to enfeeble it through
internal dissensions.  For this end she availed herself of the private letters which the king
had addressed to some of the nobles, and enclosed to her with full liberty to use them at her
discretion.  These letters, which overflowed with kind expressions were presented to those
for whom they were intended, with an attempt at secrecy, which designedly miscarried, so that
on each occasion some one or other of those who had received nothing of the sort got a hint
of them.  In order to spread suspicion the more widely numerous copies of the letters were
circulated.  This artifice attained its object.  Many members of the league began to doubt
the honesty of those to whom such brilliant promises were made; through fear of being deserted
by their principal members and supporters, they eagerly accepted the conditions which were
offered them by the regent, and evinced great anxiety for a speedy reconciliation with the
court.  The general rumor of the impending visit of the king, which the regent took care to
have widely circulated, was also of great service to her in this matter; many who could not
augur much good to themselves from the royal presence did not hesitate to accept a pardon,
which, perhaps, for what they could tell, was offered them for the last time.  Among those
who thus received private letters were Egmont and Prince of Orange.  Both had complained to
the king of the evil reports with which designing persons in Spain had labored to brand their
names, and to throw suspicion on their motives and intentions; Egmont, in particular, with
the honest simplicity which was peculiar to his character, had asked the monarch only to point
out to him what he most desired, to determine the particular action by which his favor could
be best obtained and zeal in his service evinced, and it should, he assured him, be done. 
The king in reply caused the president, Von Tyssenacque, to tell him that he could do nothing
better to refute his traducers than to show perfect submission to the royal orders, which were
so clearly and precisely drawn up, that no further exposition of them was required, nor any
particular instruction.  It was the sovereign's part to deliberate, to examine, and to decide;
unconditionally to obey was the duty of the subject; the honor of the latter consisted in his
obedence.  It did not become a member to hold itself wiser than the head.  He was assuredly
to be blamed for not having done his utmost to curb the unruliness of his sectarians; but it
was even yet in his power to make up for past negligence by at least maintaining peace and
order until the actual arrival of the king.  In thus punishing Count Egmont with reproofs like
a disobedient child, the king treated him in accordance with what he knew of his character;
with his friend he found it necessary to call in the aid of artifice and deceit. Of light was entirely

  In fine, how can you presume to remind me of an agreement which

foregn powers, set on foot illegal enlistments, and collected unlawful taxes from the subjects
of the king?  These are the reasons which have impelled me to draw together my troops, and
to increase the severity of the edicts.  Whoever now asks me to lay down my arms cannot mean
well to his country or his king, and if ye value your own lives, look to it that your own actions
acquit you, instead of judging mine."

All the hopes which the confederates might have entertained of an amicable adjustment sank
with this high-toned declaration.  Without being confident of possessing powerful support,
the regent would not, they argued, employ such language.  An army was in the field, the enemy
was before Valenciennes, the members who were the heart of the league had abandoned it, and
the regent required unconditional submission. Their cause was now so bad that open resistance
could not make it worse. If they gave themselves up defenceless into the hands of their exasperated
sovereign their fate was certain; an appeal to arms could at least make it a matter of doubt;
they, therefore, chose the latter, and began seriously to take steps for their defence.  In
order to insure the assistance of the German Protestants, Louis of Nassau attempted to persuade
the towns of Amsterdam, Antwerp, Tournay, and Valenciennes to adopt the confession of Augsburg,
and in this manner to seal their alliance with a religious union.  But the proposition was
not successful, because the hatred of the Calvinists to the Lutherans exceeded, if possible,
that which they bore to popery.  Nassau also began in earnest to negotiate for supplies from
France, the Palatinate, and Saxony.  The Count of Bergen fortified his castles; Brederode threw
himself with a small force into his strong town of Vianne on the Leek, over which he claimed
the rights of sovereignty, and which he hastily placed in a state of defense, and there awaited
a reinforcement from the league, and the issue of Nassua's negotiations.  The flag of war was
now unfurled, everywhere the drum was heard to beat; in all parts troops were seen on the march,
contributions collected, and soldiers enlisted. The agents of each party often met in the same
place, and hardly had the collectors and recruiting officers of the regent quitted a town when
it had to endure a similar visit from the agents of the league.

From Valenciennes the regent directed her attention to Herzogenbusch, where the Iconoclasts
had lately committed fresh excesses, and the party of the Protestants had gained a great accession
of strength.  In order to prevail on the citizens peaceably to receive a garrison, she sent
thither, as ambassador, the Chancellor Scheiff, from Brabant, with counsellor Merode of Petersheim,
whom she appointed governor of the town; they were instructed to secure the place by judicious
means, and to exact from the citizens a new oath of allegiance.  At the same time the Count
of Megen, who was in the neighborhood with a body of troops, was ordered to support the two
envoys in effecting their commission, and to afford the means of throwing in a garrison immediately.
But Brederode, who obtained information of these movements in Viane, had already sent thither
one of his creatures, a certain Anton von Bomber,-- a hot Calvinist, but also a brave soldier,
in order to raise the courage of his party, and to frustrate the designs of the regent.  This
Bomberg succeeded in getting possession of the letters which the chancellor brought with him
from the duchess, and contrived to substitute in their place counterfeit ones, which, by their
harsh and imperious language, were calculated to exasperate the minds of the citizens.  At
the same time he attempted to throw suspicion on both the ambassadors of the duchess as having
evil designs upon the town.  In this he succeeded so well with the mob that in their mad fury
they even laid hands on the ambassadors and placed them in confinement.  He himself, at the
head of eight thousand men, who had adopted him as their leader, advanced against the Count
of Megen, who was moving in order of battle, and gave him so warm a reception, with some heavy
artillery, that he was compelled to retire without accomplishing his object.  The regent now
sent an officer of justice to demand the release of her ambassadors, and in case of refusal
to threaten the place with siege; but Bomberg with his party surrounded the town hall and forced
the magistrate to deliver to him the key of the town.  The messenger of the regent was ridiculed
and dismissed, and an answer sent through him that the treatment of the prisoners would depend
upon Brederode's orders.  The herald, who was remaining outside before the town, now appeared
to declare war against her, which, however, the chancellor prevented.

After his futile attempt on Herzogenhusch the Count of Megen threw himself into Utrecht in
order to prevent the execution of a design which Count Brederode had formed against that town.
As it had suffered much from the army of the confederates, which was encamped in its immediate
neighborhood, near Viane, it received Megen with open arms as its protector, and conformed
to all the alterations which he made in the religious worship.  Upon this he immediately caused
a redoubt to be thrown up on the bank of the Leek, which would command Viane. Brederode, not
disposed to await his attack, quitted that rendezvous with the best part of his army and hastened
to Amsterdam.

However unprofitably the Prince of Orange appeared to be losing his time in Antwerp during
these operations he was, nevertheless, busily employed.  At his instigation the league had
commenced recruiting, and Brederode had fortified his castles, for which purpose he himself
presented him with three cannons which he had had cast at Utrecht. His eye watched all the
movements of the court, and he kept the league warned of the towns which were next menaced
with attack.  But his chief object appeared to be to get possession of the principal places
in the districts under his own government, to which end he with all his power secretly assisted
Brederode's plans against Utrecht and Amsterdam.  The most important place was the Island of
Walcheren, where the king was expected to land; and he now planned a scheme for the surprise
of this place, the conduct of which was entrusted to one of the confederate nobles, an intimate
friend of the Prince of Orange, John of Marnix, Baron of Thoulouse, and brother of Philip of
Aldegonde.

1567.  Thoulouse maintained a secret understanding with the late mayor of Middleburg, Peter
Haak, by which he expected to gain an opportunity of throwing a garrison into Middleburg and
Flushing.  The recruiting, however, for this undertaking, which was set on foot in Antwerp,
could not be carried on so quietly as not to attract the notice of the magistrate.  In order,
therefore, to lull the suspicions of the latter, and at the same time to promote the success
of the scheme, the prince caused the herald by public proclamation to order all foreign soldiers
and strangers who were in the service of the state, or employed in other business, forthwith
to quit the town.  He might, say his adversaries, by closing the gates have easily made himself
master of all these suspected recruits; but be expelled them from the town in order to drive
them the more quickly to the place of their destination.  They immediately embarked on the
Scheldt, and sailed down to Rammekens; as, however, a marketvessel of Antwerp, which ran into
Flushing a little before them had given warning of their design they were forbidden to enter
the port. They found the same difficulty at Arnemuiden, near Middleburg, although the Protestants
in that place exerted themselves to raise an insurrection in their favor.  Thoulouse, therefore,
without having accomplished anything, put about his ships and sailed back down the Scheldt
as far as Osterweel, a quarter of a mile from Antwerp, where he disembarked his people and
encamped on the shore, with the hope of getting men from Antwerp, and also in order to revive
by his presence the courage of his party, which had been cast down by the proceedings of the
magistrate.  By the aid of the Calvinistic clergy, who recruited for him, his little army increased
daily, so that at last he began to be formidable to the Antwerpians, whose whole territory
he laid waste.  The magistrate was for attacking him here with the militia, which, however,
the Prince of Orange successfully opposed by the, pretext that it would not be prudent to strip
the town of soldiers.

Meanwhile the regent had hastily brought together a small army under the command of Philip
of Launoy, which moved from Brussels to Antwerp by forced marches.  At the same time Count
Megen managed to keep the army of the Gueux shut up and employed at Viane, so that it could
neither hear of these movements nor hasten to the assistance of its confederates.  Launoy,
on his arrival attacked by surprise the dispersed crowds, who, little expecting an enemy, had
gone out to plunder, and destroyed them in one terrible carnage.  Thoulouse threw himself with
the small remnant of his troops into a country house, which had served him as his headquarters,
and for a long time defended himself with the courage of despair, until Launoy, finding it
impossible to dislodge him, set fire to the house.  The few who escaped the flames fell on
the swords of the enemy or were drowned in the Scheldt.  Thoulouse himself preferred to perish
in the flames rather than to fall into the hands of the enemy.  This victory, which swept off
more than a thousand of the enemy, was purchased by the conqueror cheaply enough, for he did
not lose more than two men.  Three hundred of the leaguers who surrendered were cut down without
mercy on the spot, as a sally from Antwerp was momentarily dreaded.

Before the battle actually commenced no anticipation of such an event had been entertained
at Antwerp.  The Prince of Orange, who had got early information of it, had taken the precaution
the day before of causing the bridge which unites the town with Osterweel to be destroyed,
in order, as he gave out, to prevent the Calvinists within the town going out to join the army
of Thoulouse.  A more probable motive seems to have been a fear lest the Catholics should attack
the army of the Gueux general in the rear, or lest Launoy should prove victorious, and try
to force his way into the town.  On the same pretext the gates of the city were also shut by
his orders, arnd the inhabitants, who did not comprehend the meaning of all these movements,
fluctuated between curiosity and alarm, until the sound of artillery from Osterweel announced
to them what there was going on.  In clamorous crowds they all ran to the walls and ramparts,
from which, as the wind drove the smoke from the contending armies, they commanded a full view
of the whole battle.  Both armies were so near to the town that they could discern their banners,
and clearly distinguish the voices of the victors and the vanquished.  More terrible even than
the battle itself was the spectacle which this town now presented.  Each of the conflicting
armies had its friends and its enemies on the wall.  All that went on in the plain roused on
the ramparts exultation or dismay; on the issue of the conflict the fate of each spectator
seemed to depend.  Every movement on the field could be read in the faces of the townsmen;
defeat and triumph, the terror of the conquered, and the fury of the conqueror. Here a painful
but idle wish to support those who are giving way, to rally those who fly; there an equally
futile desire to overtake them, to slay them, to extirpate them.  Now the Gueux fly, and ten
thousand men rejoice; Thoulouse's last place and refuge is in flames, and the hopes of twenty
thousand citizens are consumed with him.

But the first bewilderment of alarm soon gave place to a frantic desire of revenge.  Shrieking
aloud, wringing her hands and with dishevelled hair, the widow of the slain general rushed
amidst the crowds to implore their pity and help.  Excited by their favorite preacher, Hermann,
the Calvinists fly to arms, determined to avenge their brethren, or to perish with them; without
reflection, without plan or leader, guided by nothing but their anguish, their delirium, they
rush to the Red Gate of the city which leads to the field of battle; but there is no egress,
the gate is shut and the foremost of the crowd recoil on those that follow. Thousands and thousands
collect together, a dreadful rush is made to the Meer Bridge.  We are betrayed! we are prisoners!
is the general cry. Destruction to the papists, death to him who has betrayed us!--a sullen
murmur, portentous of a revolt, runs through the multitude.  They begin to suspect that all
that has taken place has been set on foot by the Roman Catholics to destroy the Calvinists.
They had slain their defenders, and they would now fall upon the defenceless.  With fatal speed
this suspicion spreads through the whole of Antwerp.  Now they can, they think, understand
the past, and they fear something still worse in the background; a frightful distrust gains
possession of every mind.  Each party dreads the other; every one sees an enemy in his neighbor;
the mystery deepens the alarm and horror; a fearful condition for a populous town, in which
every accidental concourse instantly becomes tumult, every rumor started amongst them becomes
a fact, every small spark a blazing flame, and by the force of numbers and collision all passions
are furiously inflamed.  All who bore the name of Calvinists were roused by this report.  Fifteen
thousand of them take possession of the Meer Bridge, and plant heavy artillery upon it, which
they had taken by force from the arsenal; the same thing also happens at another bridge; their
number makes them formidable, the town is in their hands; to escape an imaginary danger they
bring all Antwerp to the brink of ruin.

Immediately on the commencement of the tumult the Prince of Orange hastened to the Meer Bridge,
where, boldly forcing his way through the raging crowd, he commanded peace and entreated to
be heard.  At the other bridge Count Hogstraten, accompanied by the Burgomaster Strahlen, made
the same attempt; but not possessing a sufficient share either of eloquence or of popularity
to command attention, he referred the tumultuous crowd to the prince, around whom all Antwerp
now furiously thronged.  The gate, he endeavored to explain to them, was shut simply to keep
off the victor, whoever he might be, from the city, which would otherwise become the prey of
an infuriated soldiery.  In vain! the frantic people would not listen, and one more daring
than the rest presented his musket at him, calling him a traitor.  With tumultuous shouts they
demanded the key of the Red Gate, which he was ultimately forced to deliver into the hands
of the preacher Hermann.  But, he added with happy presence of mind, they must take heed what
they were doing; in the suburbs six hundred of the enemy's horse were waiting to receive them.
This invention, suggested by the emergency, was not so far removed from the truth as its author
perhaps imagined; for no sooner had the victorous general perceived the commotion in Antwerp
than he caused his whole cavalry to mount in the hope of being able, under favor of the disturbance,
to break into the town.  I, at least, continued the Prince of Orange, shall secure my own safety
in time, and he who follows my example will save himself much future regret.  These words opportunely
spoken and immediately acted upon had their effect.  Those who stood nearest followed him,
and were again followed by the next, so that at last the few who had already hastened out of
the city when they saw no one coming after them lost the desire of coping alone with the six
hundred horse.  All accordingly returned to the Meer Bridge, where they posted watches and
videttes, and the night was passed tumultuously under arms.

The town of Antwerp was now threatened with fearful bloodshed and pillage.  In this pressing
emergency Orange assembled an extraordinary senate, to which were summoned all the best-disposed
citizens of the four nations.  If they wished, said he, to repress the violence of the Calvinists
they must oppose them with an army strong enough and prepared to meet them.  It was therefore
resolved to arm with speed the Roman Catholic inhabitants of the town, whether natives, Italians,
or Spaniards, and, if possible, to induce the Lutherans also to join them. Its ensign to, like peculiarity

  It was not, however, advisable to proceed against him with the
laconic brevity adopted towards Brederode and the like; on the other hand, the voluntary resignation
of all his offices, which he tendered, did not meet the object of the regent, who foresaw clearly
enough how really dangerous he would become, as soon as he should feel himself independent,
and be no longer checked by any external considerations of character or duty in the prosecution
of his secret designs.  But ever since the consultation in Dendermonde the Prince of Orange
had made up his mind to quit the service of the King of Spain on the first favorable opportunity,
and till better days to leave the country itself.  A very disheartening experience had taught
him how uncertain are hopes built on the multitude, and how quickly their zeal is cooled by
the necessity of fulfilling its lofty promises.  An army was already in the field, and a far
stronger one was, he knew, on its road, under the command of the Duke of Alva.  The time for
remonstrauces was past; it was only at the head of an army that an advantageous treaty could
now be concluded with the regent, and by preventing the entrance of the Spanish general.  But
now where was he to raise this army, in want as he was of money, the sinews of warfare, since
the Protestants had retracted their boastful promises and deserted him in this pressing emergency?

     [How valiant the wish, and how sorry the deed was, is proved by the
     following instance amongst others.  Some friends of the national
     liberty, Roman Catholics as well as Protestants, had solemnly
     engaged in Amsterdam to subscribe to a common fund the hundredth
     penny of their estates, until a sum of eleven thousand florins
     should be collected, which was to be devoted to the common cause
     and interests.  An alms-box, protected by three locks, was prepared
     for the reception of these contributions.  After the expiration of
     the prescribed period it was opened, and a sum was found amounting
     to seven hundred florins, which was given to the hostess of the
     Count of Brederode, in part payment of his unliquidated score.
     Univ. Hist. of the N., vol. 3.]

Religious jealousy and hatred, moreover, separated the two Protestant churches, and stood in
the way of every salutary combination against the common enemy of their faith.  The rejection
of the Confession of Augsburg by the Calvinists had exasperated all the Protestant princes
of Germany, so that no support was to be looked for from the empire.  With Count Egmont the
excellent army of Walloons was also lost to the cause, for they followed with blind devotion
the fortunes of their general, who had taught them at St. Quentin and Gravelines to be invincible.
And again, the outrages which the Iconoclasts had perpetrated on the churches and convents
had estranged from the league the numerous, wealthy, and powerful class of the established
clergy, who, before this unlucky episode, were already more than half gained over to it; while,
by her intrigues, the regent daily contrived to deprive the league itself of some one or other
of its most influential members.

All these considerations combined induced the prince to postpone to a more favorable season
a project for which the present juncture was little suited, and to leave a country where his
longer stay could not effect any advantage for it, but must bring certain destruction on himself.
After intelligence gleaned from so many quarters, after so many proofs of distrust, so many
warnings from Madrid, he could be no longer doubtful of the sentiments of Philip towards him.
If even he had any doubt, his uncertainty would soon have been dispelled by the formidable
armament which was preparing in Spain, and which was to have for its leader, not the king,
as was falsely given out, but, as he was better informed, the Duke of Alva, his personal enemy,
and the very man he had most cause to fear.  The prince had seen too deeply into Philip's heart
to believe in the sincerity of his reconciliation after having once awakened his fears.  He
judged his own conduct too justly to reckon, like his friend Egmont, on reaping a gratitude
from the king to which he had not sown.  He could therefore expect nothing but hostility from
him, and prudence counselled him to screen himself by a timely flight from its actual outbreak.
He had hitherto obstinately refused to take the new oath, and all the written exhortations
of the regent had been fruitless.  At last she sent to him at Antwerp her private secretary,
Berti, who was to put the matter emphatically to his conscience, and forcibly remind him of
all the evil consequences which so sudden a retirement from the royal service would draw upon
the country, as well as the irreparable injury it would do to his own fair fame.  Already,
she informed him by her ambassador, his declining the required oath had cast a shade upon his
honor, and imparted to the general voice, which accused him of an understanding with the rebels,
an appearance of truth which this unconditional resignation would convert to absolute certainty.
It was for the sovereign to discharge his servants, but it did not become the servant to abandon
his sovereign. The envoy of the regent found the prince in his palace at Antwerp, already,
as it appeared, withdrawn from the public service, and entirely devoted to his private concerns.
The prince told him, in the presence of Hogstraten, that he had refused to take the required
oath because he could not find that such a proposition had ever before been made to a governor
of a province; because he had already bound himself, once for all, to the king, and therefore,
by taking this new oath, he would tacitly acknowledge that he had broken the first.  He had
also refused because the old oath enjoined him to protect the rights and privileges of the
country, but he could not tell whether this new one might not impose upon him duties which
would contravene the first; because, too, the clause which bound him to serve, if required,
against all without distinction, did not except even the emperor, his feudal lord, against
whom, however, he, as his vassal, could not conscientiously make war. He had refused to take
this oath because it might impose upon him the necessity of surrendering his friends and relations,
his children, nay, even his wife, who was a Lutheran, to butchery.  According to it, moreover,
he must lend himself to every thing which it should occur to the king's fancy or passion to
demand.  But the king might thus exact from him things which he shuddered even to think of,
and even the severities which were now, and had been all along, exercised upon the Protestants,
were the most revolting to his heart.  This oath, in short, was repugnant to his feelings as
a man, and he could not take it.  In conclusion, the name of the Duke of Alva dropped from
his lips in a tone of bitterness, and he became immediately silent.

All these objections were answered, point by point, by Berti.  Certainly such an oath had never
been required from a governor before him, because the provinces had never been similarly circumstanced.
It was not exacted because the governors had broken the first, but in order to remind them
vividly of their former vows, and to freshen their activity in the present emergency.  This
oath would not impose upon him anything which offended against the rights and privileges of
the country, for the king had sworn to observe these as well as the Prince of Orange.  The
oath did not, it was true, contain any reference to a war with the emperor, or any other sovereign
to whom the prince might be related; and if he really had scruples on this point, a distinct
clause could easily be inserted, expressly providing against such a contingency.  Care would
be taken to spare him any duties which were repugnant to his feelings as a man, and no power
on earth would compel him to act against his wife or against his children.  Berti was then
passing to the last point, which related to the Duke of Alva, but the prince, who did not wish
to have this part of his discourse canvassed, interrupted him.  "The king was coming to the
Netherlands," he said, "and he knew the king.  The king would not endure that one of his servants
should have wedded a Lutheran, and he had therefore resolved to go with his whole family into
voluntary banishment before he was obliged to submit to the same by compulsion. But," he concluded,
"wherever he might be, he would always conduct himself as a subject of the king."  Thus far-fetched
were the motives which the prince adduced to avoid touching upon the single one which really
decided him.

Berti had still a hope of obtaining, through Egmont's eloquence, what by his own he despaired
of effecting.  He therefore proposed a meeting with the latter (1567), which the prince assented
to the more willingly as he himself felt a desire to embrace his friend once more before his
departure, and if possible to snatch the deluded man from certain destruction.  This remarkable
meeting, at which the private secretary, Berti, and the young Count Mansfeld, were also present,
was the last that the two friends ever held, and took place in Villebroeck, a village on the
Rupel, between Brussels and Antwerp.  The Calvinists, whose last hope rested on the issue of
this conference, found means to acquaint themselves of its import by a spy, who concealed himself
in the chimney of the apartment where it was held.  All three attempted to shake the determination
of the prince, but their united eloquence was unable to move him from his purpose.  "It will
cost you your estates, Orange, if you persist in this intention," said the Prince of Gaure,
as he took him aside to a window.  "And you your life, Egmont, if you change not yours," replied
the former.  "To me it will at least be a consolation in my misfortunes that I desired, in
deed as well as in word, to help my country and my friends in the hour of need; but you, my
friend, you are dragging friends and country with you to destruction."  And saying these words,
he once again exhorted him, still more urgently than ever, to return to the cause of his country,
which his arm alone was yet able to preserve; if not, at least for his own sake to avoid the
tempest which was gathering against him from Spain.

But all the arguments, however lucid, with which a far-discerning prudence supplied him, and
however urgently enforced, with all the ardor and animation which the tender anxiety of friendship
could alone inspire, did not avail to destroy the fatal confidence which still fettered Egmont's
better reason.  The warning of Orange seemed to come from a sad and dispirited heart; but for
Egmont the world still smiled. To abandon the pomp and affluence in which he had grown up to
youth and manhood; to part with all the thousand conveniences of life which alone made it valuable
to him, and all this to escape an evil which his buoyant spirit regarded as remote, if not
imaginary; no, that was not a sacrifice which could be asked from Egmont.  But had he even
been less given to indulgence than he was, with what heart could he have consigned a princess,
accustomed by uninterrupted prosperity to ease and comfort, a wife who loved him as dearly
as she was beloved, the children on whom his soul hung in hope and fondness, to privations
at the prospect of which his own courage sank, and which a sublime philosophy alone can enable
sensuality to undergo.  "You will never persuade me, Orange," said Egmont, "to see things in
the gloomy light in which they appear to thy mournful prudence.  When I have succeeded in abolishing
the public preachings, and chastising the Iconoclasts, in crushing the rebels, and restoring
peace and order in the provinces, what can the king lay to my charge?  The king is good and
just; I have claims upon his gratitude, and I must not forget what I owe to myself."  "Well,
then," cried Orange, indignantly and with bitter anguish, "trust, if you will, to this royal
gratitude; but a mournful presentiment tells me--and may Heaven grant that I am deceived!--that
you, Egmont, will be the bridge by which the Spaniards will pass into our country to destroy
it."  After these words, he drew him to his bosom, ardently clasping him in his arms.  Long,
as though the sight was to serve for the remainder of his life, did he keep his eyes fixed
upon him; the tears fell; they saw each other no more.

The very next day the Prince of Orange wrote his letter of resignation to the regent, in which
he assured her of his perpetual esteem, and once again entreated her to put the best interpretation
on his present step. He then set off with his three brothers and his whole family for his own
town of Breda, where he remained only as long as was requisite to arrange some private affairs.
His eldest son, Prince Philip William, was left behind at the University of Louvain, where
he thought him sufficiently secure under the protection of the privileges of Brabant and the
immunities of the academy; an imprudence which, if it was really not designed, can hardly be
reconciled with the just estimate which, in so many other cases, he had taken of the character
of his adversary.  In Breda the heads of the Calvinists once more consulted him whether there
was still hope for them, or whether all was irretrievably lost.  "He had before advised them,"
replied the prince, "and must now do so again, to accede to the Confession of Augsburg; then
they might rely upon aid from Germany.  If they would still not consent to this, they must
raise six hundred thousand florins, or more, if they could."  "The first," they answered, "was
at variance with their conviction and their conscience; but means might perhaps be found to
raise the money if he would only let them know for what purpose he would use it."  "No!"  cried
he, with the utmost displeasure, "if I must tell you that, it is all over with the use of it."
With these words he immediately broke off the conference and dismissed the deputies.

The Prince of Orange was reproached with having squandered his fortune, and with favoring the
innovations on account of his debts; but he asserted that he still enjoyed sixty thousand florins
yearly rental. Before his departure he borrowed twenty thousand florins from the states of
Holland on the mortgage of some manors.  Men could hardly persuade themselves that he would
have succumbed to necessity so entirely, and without an effort at resistance given up all his
hopes and schemes.  But what he secretly meditated no one knew, no one had read in his heart.
Being asked how he intended to conduct himself towards the King of Spain, "Quietly," was his
answer, "unless he touches my honor or my estates."  He left the Netherlands soon afterwards,
and betook himself in retirement to the town of Dillenburg, in Nassau, at which place he was
born.  He was accompanied to Germany by many hundreds, either as his servants or as volunteers,
and was soon followed by Counts Hogstraten, Kuilemberg, and Bergen, who preferred to share
a voluntary exile with him rather than recklessly involve themselves in an uncertain destiny.
In his departure the nation saw the flight of its guardian angel; many had adored, all had
honored him.  With him the last stay of the Protestants gave way; they, however, had greater
hopes from this man in exile than from all the others together who remained behind.  Even the
Roman Catholics could not witness his departure without regret. Them also had he shielded from
tyranny; he had not unfrequently protected them against the oppression of their own church,
and he had rescued many of them from the sanguinary jealousy of their religious opponents.
A few fanatics among the Calvinists, who were offended with his proposal of an alliance with
their brethren, who avowed the Confession of Augsburg, solemnized with secret thanksgivings
the day on which the enemy left them.  (1567).

                DECAY AND DISPERSION OF THE GEUSEN LEAGUE.

Immediately after taking leave of his friend, the Prince of Gaure hastened back to Brussels,
to receive from the regent the reward of his firmness, and there, in the excitement of the
court and in the sunshine of his good fortune, to dispel the light cloud which the earnest
warnings of the Prince of Orange had cast over his natural gayety. The flight of the latter
now left him in possession of the stage. He had now no longer any rival in the republic to
dim his glory.  With redoubled zeal he wooed the transient favor of the court, above which
he ought to have felt himself far exalted.  All Brussels must participate in his joy.  He gave
splendid banquets and public entertainments, at which, the better to eradicate all suspicion
from his mind, the regent herself frequently attended.  Not content with having taken the required
oath, he outstripped the most devout in devotion; outran the most zealous in zeal to extirpate
the Protestant faith, and to reduce by force of arms the refractory towns of Flanders.  He
declared to his old friend, Count Hogstraten, as also to the rest of the Gueux, that he would
withdraw from them his friendship forever if they hesitated any longer to return into the bosom
of the church, and reconcile themselves with their king.  All the confidential letters which
had been exchanged between him and them were returned, and by this last step the breach between
them was made public and irreparable.  Egmont's secession, and the flight of the Prince of
Orange, destroyed the last hope of the Protestants and dissolved the whole league of the Gueux.

            ALVA'S ARMAMENT AND EXPEDITION TO THE NETHERLANDS.

But it was otherwise determined in the council at Madrid.  The minister, Granvella, who, even
while absent himself, ruled the Spanish cabinet by his adherents; the Cardinal Grand Inquisitor,
Spinosa, and the Duke of Alva, swayed respectively by hatred, a spirit of persecution, or private
interest, had outvoted the milder councils of the Prince Ruy Gomes of Eboli, the Count of Feria,
and the king's confessor, Fresneda.  The insurrection, it was urged by the former, was indeed
quelled for the present, but only because the rebels were awed by the rumor of the king's armed
approach; it was to fear of punishment alone, and not to sorrow for their crime, that the present
calm was to be ascribed, and it would soon again be broken if that feeling were allowed to
subside. In fact, the offences of the people fairly afforded the king the opportunity he had
so long desired of carrying out his despotic views with an appearance of justice.  The peaceable
settlement for which the regent took credit to herself was very far from according with his
wishes, which sought rather for a legitimate pretext to deprive the provinces of their privileges,
which were so obnoxious to his despotic temper.

With an impenetrable dissimulation Philip had hitherto fostered the general delusion that he
was about to visit the provinces in person, while all along nothing could have been more remote
from his real intentions.  Travelling at any time ill suited the methodical regularity of his
life, which moved with the precision of clockwork; and his narrow and sluggish intellect was
oppressed by the variety and multitude of objects with which new scenes crowded it.  The difficulties
and dangers which would attend a journey to the Netherlands must, therefore, have been peculiarly
alarming to his natural timidity and love of ease.  Why should he, who, in all that he did,
was accustomed to consider himself alone, and to make men accommodate themselves to his principles,
not his principles to men, undertake so perilous an expedition, when he could see neither the
advantage nor necessity of it.  Moreover, as it had ever been to him an utter impossibility
to separate, even for a moment, his person from his royal dignity, which no prince ever guarded
so tenaciously and pedantically as himself, so the magnificence and ceremony which in his mind
were inseparably connected with such a journey, and the expenses which, on this account, it
would necessarily occasion, were of themselves sufficient motives to account for his indisposition
to it, without its being at all requisite to call in the aid of the influence of his favorite,
Ruy Gomes, who is said to have desired to separate his rival, the Duke of Alva, from the king.
Little, however, as be seriously intended this journey, he still deemed it advisable to keep
up the expectation of it, as well with a view of sustaining the courage of the loyal as of
preventing a dangerous combination of the disaffected, and stopping the further progress of
the rebels.

In order to carry on the deception as long as possible, Philip made extensive preparations
for his departure, and neglected nothing which could be required for such an event.  He ordered
ships to be fitted out, appointed the officers and others to attend him.  To allay the suspicion
such warlike preparations might excite in all foreign courts, they were informed through his
ambassadors of his real design.  He applied to the King of France for a passage for himself
and attendants through that kingdom, and consulted the Duke of Savoy as to the preferable route.
He caused a list to be drawn up of all the towns and fortified places that lay in his march,
and directed all the intermediate distances to be accurately laid down.  Orders were issued
for taking a map and survey of the whole extent of country between Savoy and Burgundy, the
duke being requested to furnish the requisite surveyors and scientific officers. To such lengths
was the deception carried that the regent was commanded to hold eight vessels at least in readiness
off Zealand, and to despatch them to meet the king the instant she heard of his having sailed
from Spain; and these ships she actually got ready, and caused prayers to be offered up in
all the churches for the king's safety during the voyage, though in secret many persons did
not scruple to remark that in his chamber at Madrid his majesty would not have much cause to
dread the storms at sea.  Philip played his part with such masterly skill that the Belgian
ambassadors at Madrid, Lords Bergen and Montigny, who at first had disbelieved in the sincerity
of his pretended journey, began at last to be alarmed, and infected their friends in Brussels
with similar apprehensions.  An attack of tertian ague, which about this time the king suffered,
or perhaps feigned, in Segovia, afforded a plausible pretence for postponing his journey, while
meantime the preparations for it were carried on with the utmost activity.  At last, when the
urgent and repeated solicitations of his sister compelled him to make a definite explanation
of his plans, he gave orders that the Duke of Alva should set out forthwith with an army, both
to clear the way before him of rebels, and to enhance the splendor of his own royal arrival.
He did not yet venture to throw off the mask and announce the duke as his substitute.  He had
but too much reason to fear that the submission which his Flemish nobles would cheerfully yield
to their sovereign would be refused to one of his servants, whose cruel character was well
known, and who, moreover, was detested as a foreigner and the enemy of their constitution.
And, in fact, the universal belief that the king was soon to follow, which long survived Alva's
entrance into the country, restrained the outbreak of disturbances which otherwise would assuredly
have been caused by the cruelties which marked the very opening of the duke's government.

The clergy of Spain, and especially the Inquisition, contributed richly towards the expenses
of this expedition as to a holy war.  Throughout Spain the enlisting was carried on with the
utmost zeal.  The viceroys and governors of Sardinia, Sicily, Naples, and Milan received orders
to select the best of their Italian and Spanish troops in the garrisons and despatch them to
the general rendezvous in the Genoese territory, where the Duke of Alva would exchange them
for the Spanish recruits which he should bring with him.  At the same time the regent was commanded
to hold in readiness a few more regiments of German infanty in Luxembourg, under the command
of the Counts Eberstein, Schaumburg, and Lodrona, and also some squadrons of light cavalry
in the Duchy of Burgundy to reinforce the Spanish general immediately on his entrance into
the provinces.  The Count of Barlaimont was commissioned to furnish the necessary provision
for the armament, and a sum of two hundred thousand gold florins was remitted to the regent
to enable her to meet these expenses and to maintain her own troops.

The French court, however, under pretence of the danger to be apprehended from the Huguenots,
had refused to allow the Spanish army to pass through France.  Philip applied to the Dukes
of Savoy and Lorraine, who were too dependent upon him to refuse his request.  The former merely
stipulated that he should be allowed to maintain two thousand infantry and a squadron of horse
at the king's expense in order to protect his country from the injuries to which it might otherwise
be exposed from the passage of the Spanish army.  At the same time he undertook to provide
the necessary supplies for its maintenance during the transit.

The rumor of this arrangement roused the Huguenots, the Genevese, the Swiss, and the Grisons.
The Prince of Conde and the Admiral Coligny entreated Charles IX. not to neglect so favorable
a moment of inflicting a deadly blow on the hereditary foe of France.  With the aid of the
Swiss, the Genevese, and his own Protestant subjects, it would, they alleged, be an easy matter
to destroy the flower of the Spanish troops in the narrow passes of the Alpine mountains; and
they promised to support him in this undertaking with an army of fifty thousand Huguenots.
This advice, however, whose dangerous object was not easily to be mistaken, was plausibly declined
by Charles IX., who assured them that he was both able and anxious to provide for the security
of his kingdom.  He hastily despatched troops to cover the French frontiers; and the republics
of Geneva, Bern, Zurich, and the Grisons followed his example, all ready to offer a determined
opposition to the dreaded enemy of their religion and their liberty.

On the 5th of May, 1567, the Duke of Alva set sail from Carthagena with thirty galleys, which
had been furnished by Andrew Doria and the Duke Cosmo of Florence, and within eight days landed
at Genoa, where the four regiments were waiting to join him.  But a tertian ague, with which
he was seized shortly after his arrival, compelled him to remain for some days inactive in
Lombardy--a delay of which the neighboring powers availed themselves to prepare for defence.
As soon as the duke recovered he held at Asti, in Montferrat, a review of all his troops, who
were more formidable by their valor than by their numbers, since cavalry and infantry together
did not amount to much above ten thousand men.  In his long and perilous march he did not wish
to encumber himself with useless supernumeraries, which would only impede his progress and
increase the difficulty of supporting his army.  These ten thousand veterans were to form the
nucleus of a greater army, which, according as circumstances and occasion might require, he
could easily assemble in the Netherlands themselves.

This array, however, was as select as it was small.  It consisted of the remains of those victorious
legions at whose head Charles V. had made Europe tremble; sanguinary, indomitable bands, in
whose battalions the firmness of the old Macedonian phalanx lived again; rapid in their evolutions
from long practice, hardy and enduring, proud of their leader's success, and confident from
past victories, formidable by their licentiousness, but still more so by their discipline;
let loose with all the passions of a warmer climate upon a rich and peaceful country, and inexorable
towards an enemy whom the church had cursed.  Their fanatical and sanguinary spirit, their
thirst for glory and innate courage was aided by a rude sensuality, the instrument by which
the Spanish general firmly and surely ruled his otherwise intractable troops.  With a prudent
indulgence he allowed riot and voluptuousness to reign throughout the camp.  Under his tacit
connivance Italian courtezans followed the standards; even in the march across the Apennines,
where the high price of the necessaries of life compelled him to reduce his force to the smallest
possible number, he preferred to have a few regiments less rather than to leave behind these
instruments of voluptuousness.

     [The bacchanalian procession of this army contrasted strangely
     enough with the gloomy seriousness and pretended sanctity of his
     aim.  The number of these women was so great that to restrain the
     disorders and quarrelling among themselves they hit upon the
     expedient of establishing a discipline of their own.  They ranged
     themselves under particular flags, marched in ranks and sections,
     and in admirable military order, after each battalion, and classed
     themselves with strict etiquette according to their rank and pay.]

But industriously as Alva strove to relax the morals of his soldiers, he enforced the more
rigidly a strict military discipline, which was interrupted only by a victory or rendered less
severe by a battle. The Discography (Arber. 18-- a number for November 25,1674.) it was participate at Stationer'Corridor,

  Meanwhile,
the duke was fearful lest so fair an opportunity for the accomplishment of his plans might
not last long, and lest some act of imprudence might destroy the feeling of security which
had tempted both his victims voluntarily to put themselves into his power; he only waited for
a third; Hogstraten also was to be taken in the same net. Under a plausible pretext of business
he therefore summoned him to the metropolis.  At the same time that he purposed to secure the
three counts in Brussels, Colonel Lodrona was to arrest the burgomaster, Strahlen, in Antwerp,
an intimate friend of the Prince of Orange, and suspected of having favored the Calvinists;
another officer was to seize the private secretary of Count Egmont, whose name was John Cassembrot
von Beckerzeel, as also some secretaries of Count Horn, and was to possess themselves of their
papers.

When the day arrived which had been fixed upon for the execution of this plan, the duke summoned
all the counsellors and knights before him to confer with them upon matters of state.  On this
occasion the Duke of Arschot, the Counts Mansfeld, Barlaimont, and Aremberg attended on the
part of the Netherlands, and on the part of the Spaniards besides the duke's sons, Vitelli,
Serbellon, and Ibarra.  The young Count Mansfeld, who likewise appeared at the meeting, received
a sign from his father to withdraw with all speed, and by a hasty flight avoid the fate which
was impending over him as a former member of the Geusen league.  The duke purposely prolonged
the consultation to give time before he acted for the arrival of the couriers from Antwerp,
who were to bring him the tidings of the arrest of the other parties.  To avoid exciting any
suspicion, the engineer, Pacotto, was required to attend the meeting to lay before it the plans
for some fortifications.  At last intelligence was brought him that Lodrona had successfully
executed his commission. Upon this the duke dexterously broke off the debate and dismissed
the council.  And now, as Count Egmont was about to repair to the apartment of Don Ferdinand,
to finish a game that he had commenced with him, the captain of the duke's body guard, Sancho
D'Avila, stopped him, and demanded his sword in the king's name.  At the same time he was surrounded
by a number of Spanish soldiers, who, as had been preconcerted, suddenly advanced from their
concealment.  So unexpected a blow deprived Egmont for some moments of all powers of utterance
and recollection; after a while, however, he collected himself, and taking his sword from his
side with dignified composure, said, as he delivered it into the hands of the Spaniard, "This
sword has before this on more than one occasion successfully defended the king's cause."  Another
Spanish officer arrested Count Horn as he was returning to his house without the least suspicion
of danger.  Horn's first inquiry was after Egmont.  On being told that the same fate had just
happened to his friend he surrendered himself without resistance.  "I have suffered myself
to be guided by him," he exclaimed, "it is fair that I should share his destiny."  The two
counts were placed in confinement in separate apartments.  While this was going on in the interior
of Kuilemberg house the whole garrison were drawn out under arms in front of it.  No one knew
what had taken place inside, a mysterious terror diffused itself throughout Brussels until
rumor spread the news of this fatal event.  Each felt as if he himself were the sufferer; with
many indignation at Egmont's blind infatuation preponderated over sympathy for his fate; all
rejoiced that Orange had escaped.  The first question of the Cardinal Granvella, too, when
these tidings reached him in Rome, is said to have been, whether they had taken the Silent
One also.  On being answered in the negative he shook his head "then as they have let him escape
they have got nothing."  Fate ordained better for the Count of Hogstraten.  Compelled by ill-health
to travel slowly, he was met by the report of this event while he was yet on his way.  He hastily
turned back, and fortunately escaped destruction.  Immediately after Egmont's seizure a writing
was extorted from him, addressed to the commandant of the citadel of Ghent, ordering that officer
to deliver the fortress to the Spanish Colonel Alphonso d'Ulloa.  Upon this the two counts
were then (after they had been for some weeks confined in Brussels) conveyed under a guard
of three thousand Spaniards to Ghent, where they remained imprisoned till late in the following

  But far the greater number,
with all their endeavors to keep an exact mean, could not help making a difference between
the homage they paid to the rising sun and that which they bestowed on the setting luminary.
The royal palace in Brussels became more and more deserted, while the throng at Kuilemberg
house daily increased.  But what wounded the sensitiveness of the duchess most acutely was
the arrest of Horn and Egmont, which was planned and executed by the duke without her knowledge
or consent, just as if there had been no such person as herself in existence.  Alva did, indeed,
after the act was done, endeavor to appease her by declaring that the design had been purposely
kept secret from her in order to spare her name from being mixed up in so odious a transaction;
but no such considerations of delicacy could close the wound which had been inflicted on her
pride.  In order at once to escape all risk of similar insults, of which the present was probably
only a forerunner, she despatched her private secretary, Macchiavell, to the court of her brother,
there to solicit earnestly for permission to resign the regency.  The request was granted without
difficulty by the king, who accompanied his consent with every mark of his highest esteem.
He would put aside (so the king expressed himself) his own advantage and that of the provinces
in order to oblige his sister.  He sent a present of thirty thousand dollars, and allotted
to her a yearly pension of twenty thousand.

     [Which, however, does not appear to have been very punctually paid,
     if a pamphlet maybe trusted which was printed during her lifetime.
     (It bears the title: Discours sur la Blessure de Monseigneur Prince
     d'Orange, 1582, without notice of the place where it was printed,
     and is to be found in the Elector's library at Dresden.) She
     languished, it is there stated, at Namur in poverty, and so ill-
     supported by her son (the then governor of the Netherlands), that
     her own secretary, Aldrobandin, called her sojourn there an exile.
     But the writer goes on to ask what better treatment could she
     expect from a son who, when still very young, being on a visit to
     her at Brussels, snapped his fingers at her behind her back.]

At the same time a diploma was forwarded to the Duke of Alva, constituting him, in her stead,
viceroy of all the Netherlands, with unlimited powers.

Gladly would Margaret have learned that she was permitted to resign the regency before a solemn
assembly of the states, a wish which she had not very obscurely hinted to the king.  But she
was not gratified.  She was particularly fond of solemnity, and the example of the Emperor,
her father, who had exhibited the extraordinary spectacle of his abdication of the crown in
this very city, seemed to have great attractions for her.  As she was compelled to part with
supreme power, she could scarcely be blamed for wishing to do so with as much splendor as possible.
Moreover, she had not failed to observe how much the general hatred of the duke had effected
in her own favor, and she looked, therefore, the more wistfully forward to a scene, which promised
to be at once so flattering to her and so affecting.  She would have been glad to mingle her
own tears with those which she hoped to see shed by the Netherlanders for their good regent.
Thus the bitterness of her descent from the throne would have been alleviated by the expression
of general sympathy.  Little as she had done to merit the general esteem during the nine years
of her administration, while fortune smiled upon her, and the approbation of her sovereign
was the limit to all her wishes, yet now the sympathy of the nation had acquired a value in
her eyes as the only thing which could in some degree compensate to her for the disappointment
of all her other hopes.  Fain would she have persuaded herself that she had become a voluntary
sacrifice to her goodness of heart and her too humane feelings towards the Netherlanders. 
As, however, the king was very far from being disposed to incur any danger by calling a general
assembly of the states, in order to gratify a mere caprice of his sister, she was obliged to
content herself with a farewell letter to them.  In this document she went over her whole administration,
recounted, not without ostentation, the difficulties with which she had had to struggle, the
evils which, by her dexterity, she had prevented, and wound up at last by saying that she left
a finished work, and had to transfer to her successor nothing but the punishment of offenders.
The king, too, was repeatly compelled to hear the same statement, and she left nothing undone
to arrogate to herself the glory of any future advantages which it might be the good fortune
of the duke to realize.  Her own merits, as something which did not admit of a doubt, but was
at the same time a burden oppressive to her modesty, she laid at the feet of the king.

Dispassionate posterity may, nevertheless; hesitate to subscribe unreservedly to this favorable
opinion.  Even though the united voice of her contemporaries, and the testimony of the Netherlands
themselves vouch for it, a third party will not be denied the right to examine her claims with
stricter scrutiny.  The popular mind, easily affected, is but too ready to count the absence
of a vice as an additional virtue, and, under the pressure of existing evil, to give excess
of praise for past benefits.

The Netherlander seems to have concentrated all his hatred upon the Spanish name.  To lay the
blame of the national evils on the regent would tend to remove from the king and his minister
the curses which he would rather shower upon them alone and undividedly; and the Duke of Alva's
government of the Netherlands was, perhaps, not the proper point of view from which to test
the merits of his predecessor.  It was undoubtedly no light task to meet the king's expectations
without infringing the rights of the people and the duties of humanity; but in struggling to
effect these two contradictory objects Margaret had accomplished neither.  She had deeply injured
the nation, while comparatively she had done little service to the king.  It is true that she
at last crushed the Protestant faction, but the accidental outbreak of the Iconoclasts assisted
her in this more than all her dexterity. She certainly succeeded by her intrigues in dissolving
the league of the nobles, but not until the first blow had been struck at its roots by internal
dissensions.  The object, to secure which she had for many years vainly exhaused her whole
policy, was effected at last by a single enlistment of troops, for which, however, the orders
were issued from Madrid.  She delivered to the duke, no doubt, a tranquillized country; but
it cannot be denied that the dread of his approach had the chief share in tranquillizing it.
By her reports she led the council in Spain astray; because she never informed it of the disease,
but only of the occasional symptoms; never of the universal feeling and voice of the nation,
but only of the misconduct of factions.  Her faulty administration, moreover, drew the people
into the crime, because she exasperated without sufficiently awing them.  She it was that brought
the murderous Alva into the country by leading the king to believe that the disturbances in
the provinces were to be ascribed, not so much to the severity of the royal ordinances, as
to the unworthiness of those who were charged with their execution.  Margaret possessed natural
capacity and intellect; and an acquired political tact enabled her to meet any ordinary case;
but she wanted that creative genius which, for new and extraordinary emergencies, invents new
maxims, or wisely oversteps old ones.  In a country where honesty was the best policy, she
adopted the unfortunate plan of practising her insidious Italian policy, and thereby sowed
the seeds of a fatal distrust in the minds of the people.  The indulgence which has been so
liberally imputed to her as a merit was, in truth, extorted from her weakness and timidity
by the courageous opposition of the nation; she had never departed from the strict letter of
the royal commands by her own spontaneous resolution; never did the gentle feelings of innate
humanity lead her to misinterpret the cruel purport of her instructions.  Even the few concessions
to which necessity compelled her were granted with an uncertain and shrinking hand, as if fearing
to give too much; and she lost the fruit of her benefactions because she mutilated them by
a sordid closeness.  What in all the other relations of her life she was too little, she was
on the throne too much--a woman!  She had it in her power, after Granvella's expulsion, to
become the benefactress of the Belgian nation, but she did not.  Her supreme good was the approbation
of her king, her greatest misfortune his displeasure; with all the eminent qualities of her
mind she remained an ordinary character because her heart was destitute of native nobility.
She used a melancholy power with much moderation, and stained her government with no deed of
arbitrary cruelty; nay, if it had depended on her, she would have always acted humanely.  Years
afterwards, when her idol, Philip II., had long forgotten her, the Netherlanders still honored
her memory; but she was far from deserving the glory which her successor's inhumanity reflected
upon her.

She left Brussels about the end of December, 1567.  The duke escorted her as far as the frontiers
of Brabant, and there left her under the protection of Count Mansfeld in order to hasten back
to the metropolis and show himself to the Netherlanders as sole regent.

              TRIAL AND EXECUTION OF COUNTS EGMONT AND HORN.

The two counts were a few weeks after their arrest conveyed to Ghent under an escort of three
thousand Spaniards, where they were confined in the citadel for more than eight months.  Their
trial commenced in due form before the council of twelve, and the solicitor-general, John Du
Bois, conducted the proceedings.  The indictment against Egmont consisted of ninety counts,
and that against Horn of sixty.  It would occupy too much space to introduce them here.  Every
action, however innocent, every omission of duty, was interpreted on the principle which had
been laid down in the opening of the indictment, "that the two counts, in conjunction with
the Prince of Orange, had planned the overthrow of the royal authority in the Netherlands,
and the usurpation of the government of the country;" the expulsion of Granvella; the embassy
of Egmont to Madrid; the confederacy of the Gueux; the concessions which they made to the Protestants
in the provinces under their government--all were made to have a connection with, and reference
to, this deliberate design.  Thus importance was attached to the most insignificant occurrences,
and one action made to darken and discolor another.  By taking care to treat each of the charges
as in itself a treasonable offence it was the more easy to justify a sentence of high treason
by the whole.

The accusations were sent to each of the prisoners, who were required to reply to them within
five days.  After doing so they were allowed to employ solicitors and advocates, who were permitted
free access to them; but as they were accused of treason their friends were prohibited from
visiting them.  Count Egmont employed for his solicitor Von Landas, and made choice of a few
eminent advocates from Brussels.

The first step was to demur against the tribunal which was to try them, since by the privilege
of their order they, as Knights of the Golden Fleece, were amenable only to the king himself,
the grand master.  But this demurrer was overruled, and they were required to produce their
witnesses, in default of which they were to be proceeded against /in contumaciam./  Egmont
had satisfactorily answered to eighty-two counts, while Count Horn had refuted the charges
against him, article by article.  The accusation and the defence are still extant; on that
defence every impartial tribunal would have acquitted them both.  The Procurator Fiscal pressed
for the production of their evidence, and the Duke of Alva issued his repeated commands to
use despatch.  They delayed, however, from week to week, while they renewed their protests
against the illegality of the court.  At last the duke assigned them nine days to produce their
proofs; on the lapse of that period they were to be declared guilty, and as having forfeited
all right of defence.

During the progress of the trial the relations and friends of the two counts were not idle.
Egmont's wife, by birth a duchess of Bavaria, addressed petitions to the princes of the German
empire, to the Emperor, and to the King of Spain.  The Countess Horn, mother of the imprisoned
count, who was connected by the ties of friendship or of blood with the principal royal families
of Germany, did the same.  All alike protested loudly against this illegal proceeding, and
appealed to the liberty of the German empire, on which Horn, as a count of the empire, had
special claims; the liberty of the Netherlands and the privileges of the Order of the Golden
Fleece were likewise insisted upon.  The Countess Egmont succeeded in obtaining the intercession
of almost every German court in behalf of her husband.  The King of Spain and his viceroy were
besieged by applications in behalf of the accused, which were referred from one to the other,
and made light of by both.  Countess Horn collected certificates from all the Knights of the
Golden Fleece in Spain, Germany, and Italy to prove the privileges of the order.  Alva rejected
them with a declaration that they had no force in such a case as the present.  "The crimes
of which the counts are accused relate to the affairs of the Belgian provinces, and he, the
duke, was appointed by the king sole judge of all matters connected with those countries."

Four months had been allowed to the solicitor-general to draw up the indictment, and five were
granted to the two counts to prepare for their defence.  But instead of losing their time and
trouble in adducing their evidence, which, perhaps, would have profited then but little, they
preferred wasting it in protests against the judges, which availed them still less.  By the
former course they would probably have delayed the final sentence, and in the time thus gained
the powerful intercession of their friends might perhaps have not been ineffectual.  By obstinately
persisting in denying the competency of the tribunal which was to try them, they furnished
the duke with an excuse for cutting short the proceedings.  After the last assigned period
had expired, on the 1st of June, 1658, the council of twelve declared them guilty, and on the
4th of that month sentence of death was pronounced against them.

The execution of twenty-five noble Netherlanders, who were beheaded in three successive days
in the marketplace at Brussels, was the terrible prelude to the fate of the two counts.  John
Casembrot von Beckerzeel, secretary to Count Egmont, was one of the unfortunates, who was thus
rewarded for his fidelity to his master, which he steadfastly maintained even upon the rack,
and for his zeal in the service of the king, which he had manifested against the Iconoclasts.
The others had either been taken prisoners, with arms in their hands, in the insurrection of
the "Gueux," or apprehended and condemned as traitors on account of having taken a part in
the petition of the nobles.

The duke had reason to hasten the execution of the sentence.  Count Louis of Nassau had given
battle to the Count of Aremberg, near the monastery of Heiligerlee, in Groningen, and had the
good fortune to defeat him. Immediately after his victory he had advanced against Groningen,
and laid siege to it.  The success of his arms had raised the courage of his faction; and the
Prince of Orange, his brother, was close at hand with an army to support him.  These circumstances
made the duke's presence necessary in those distant provinces; but he could not venture to
leave Brussels before the fate of two such important prisoners was decided.  The whole nation
loved them, which was not a little increased by their unhappy fate.  Even the strict papists
disapproved of the execution of these eminent nobles.  The slightest advantage which the arms
of the rebels might gain over the duke, or even the report of a defeat, would cause a revolution
in Brussels, which would immediately set the two counts at liberty. He come near me and to forbid

  Besides, the adjacent towns of Brussels,
Malines, Ghent, Dendermonde, and others, were all at this time in the hands of the league,
and could aid the place from the land side also.  To blockade, therefore, the town by land,
and to cut off its communication with Flanders and Brabant, required two different armies,
one on each bank of the river.  A sufficient fleet was likewise needed to guard the passage
of the Scheldt, and to prevent all attempts at relief, which would most certainly be made from
Zealand.  But by the war which he had still to carry on in other quarters, and by the numerous
garrisons which he was obliged to leave in the towns and fortified places, the army of the
duke was reduced to ten thousand infantry and seventeen hundred horse, a force very inadequate
for an undertaking of such magnitude.  Moreover, these troops were deficient in the most necessary
supplies, and the long arrears of pay had excited them to subdued murmurs, which hourly threatened
to break out into open mutiny. If, notwithstanding these difficulties, he should still attempt
the seige, there would be much occasion to fear from the strongholds of the enemy, which were
left in the rear, and from which it would be easy, by vigorous sallies, to annoy an army distributed
over so many places, and to expose it to want by cutting off its supplies.

All these considerations were brought forward by the council of war, before which the Duke
of Parrna now laid his scheme.  However great the confidence which they placed in themselves,
and in the proved abilities of such a leader, nevertheless the most experienced generals did
not disguise their despair of a fortunate result.  Two only were exceptions, Capizucchi and
Mondragone, whose ardent courage placed them above all apprehensions; the rest concurred in
dissuading the duke from attempting so hazardous an enterprise, by which they ran the risk
of forfeiting the fruit of all their former victories and tarnishing the glory they had already
earned.

But objections, which he had already made to himself and refuted, could not shake the Duke
of Parma in his purpose.  Not in ignorance of its inseparable dangers, not from thoughtless
overvaluing his forces had he taken this bold resolve.  But that instinctive genius which leads
great men by paths which inferior minds either never enter upon or never finish, raised him
above the influence of the doubts which a cold and narrow prudence would oppose to his views;
and, without being able to convince his generals, he felt the correctness of his calculations
in a conviction indistinct, indeed, but not on that account less indubitable. A succession
of fortunate results had raised his confidence, and the sight of his army, unequalled in Europe
for discipline, experience, and valor, and commanded by a chosen body of the most distinguished
officers, did not permit him to entertain fear for a moment.  To those who objected to the
small number of his troops, he answered, that however long the pike, it is only the point that
kills; and that in military enterprise, the moving power was of more importance than the mass
to be moved.  He was aware, indeed, of the discontent of his troops, but he knew also their
obedience; and he thought, moreover, that the best means to stifle their murmurs was by keeping
them employed in some important undertaking, by stimulating their desire of glory by the splendor
of the enterprise, and their rapacity by hopes of the rich booty which the capture of so wealthy
a town would hold out.

In the plan which he now formed for the conduct of the siege he endeavored to meet all these
difficulties.  Famine was the only instrument by which he could hope to subdue the town; but
effectually to use this formidable weapon, it would be expedient to cut off all its land and
water communications.  With this view, the first object was to stop, or at least to impede,
the arrival of supplies from Zealand. Idleness and Attack of the thing begot in me every desire
of enjoying that walls, beginning so to grow the familiar, i had resolved the two Maids to let me

the two first with child before least two last were brought to bed,
my custome being not to lie with the of them after they were with

after she was with the child, which also there was at no first time

  Furious sallies of the besieged, led by Odets von Teligny,
supported by the cannon of the fort, destroyed all the works of the Spaniards, and an inundation,
which was effected by opening the sluices, finally drove them away from the place after a three
weeks' siege, and with the loss of nearly two thousand killed.  They now retired into their
fortified camp at Stabroek, and contented themselves with taking possession of the dams which
run across the lowlands of Bergen, and oppose a breastwork to the encroachments of the East
Scheldt.

The failure of his attempt upon the fort of Lillo compelled the Prince of Parma to change his
measures.  As he could not succeed in stopping the passage of the Scheldt by his original plan,
on which the success of the siege entirely depended, he determined to effect his purpose by
throwing a bridge across the whole breadth of the river.  The thought was bold, and there were
many who held it to be rash.  Both the breadth of the stream, which at this part exceeds twelve
hundred paces, as well as its violence, which is still further augmented by the tides of the
neighboring sea, appeared to render every attempt of this kind impracticable.  Moreover, he
had to contend with a deficiency of timber, vessels, and workmen, as well as with the dangerous
position between the fleets of Antwerp and of Zealand, to which it would necessarily be an
easy task, in combination with a boisterous element, to interrupt so tedious a work.  But the
Prince of Parma knew his power, and his settled resolution would yield to nothing short of
absolute impossibility. After he had caused the breadth as well as the depth of the river to
be measured, and had consulted with two of his most skilful engineers, Barocci and Plato, it
was settled that the bridge should be constructed between Calloo in Flanders and Ordain in
Brabant.  This spot was selected because the river is here narrowest, and bends a little to
the right, and so detains vessels a while by compelling them to tack.  To cover the bridge
strong bastions were erected at both ends, of which the one on the Flanders side was named
Fort St. Maria, the other, on the Brabant side, Fort St. Philip, in honor of the king.

While active preparations were making in the Spanish camp for the execution of this scheme,
and the whole attention of the enemy was directed to it, the duke made an unexpected attack
upon Dendermonde, a strong town between Ghent and Antwerp, at the confluence of the Dender
and the Scheldt.  As long as this important place was in the hands of the enemy the towns of
Ghent and Antwerp could mutually support each other, and by the facility of their communication
frustrate all the efforts of the besiegers.  Its capture would leave the prince free to act
against both towns, and might decide the fate of his undertaking. The rapidity of his attack
left the besieged no time to open their sluices and lay the country under water.  A hot cannonade
was opened upon the chief bastion of the town before the Brussels gate, but was answered by
the fire of the besieged, which made great havoc amongst the Spaniards.  It increased, however,
rather than discouraged their ardor, and the insults of the garrison, who mutilated the statue
of a saint before their eyes, and after treating it with the most contumelious indignity, hurled
it down from the rampart, raised their fury to the highest pitch.  Clamorously they demanded
to be led against the bastion before their fire had made a sufficient breach in it, and the
prince, to avail himself of the first ardor of their impetuosity, gave the signal for the assault.
After a sanguinary contest of two hours the rampart was mounted, and those who were not sacrificed
to the first fury of the Spaniards threw themselves into the town.  The latter was indeed now
more exposed, a fire being directed upon it from the works which had been carried; but its
strong walls and the broad moat which surrounded it gave reason to expect a protracted resistance.
The inventive resources of the Prince of Parma soon overcame this obstacle also. While the
bombardment was carried on night and day, the troops were incessantly employed in diverting
the course of the Dender, which supplied the fosse with water, and the besieged were seized
with despair as they saw the water of the trenches, the last defence of the town, gradually
disappear.  They hastened to capitulate, and in August, 1584, received a Spanish garrison.
Thus, in the space of eleven days, the Prince of Parrna accomplished an undertaking which,
in the opinion of competent judges, would require as many weeks.

The town of Ghent, now cut off from Antwerp and the sea, and hard pressed by the troops of
the king, which were encamped in its vicinity, and without hope of immediate succor, began
to despair, as famine, with all its dreadful train, advanced upon them with rapid steps.  The
inhabitants therefore despatched deputies to the Spanish camp at Bevern, to tender its submission
to the king upon the same terms as the prince had a short time previously offered.  The deputies
were informed that the time for treaties was past, and that an unconditional submission alone
could appease the just anger of the monarch whom they had offended by their rebellion.  Nay,
they were even given to understand that it would be only through his great mercy if the same
humiliation were not exacted from them as their rebellious ancestors were forced to undergo
under Charles V., namely, to implore pardon half-naked, and with a cord round their necks.
The deputies returned to Ghent in despair, but three days afterwards a new deputation was sent
to the Spanish camp, which at last, by the intercession of one of the prince's friends, who
was a prisoner in Ghent, obtained peace upon moderate terms.  The town was to pay a fine of
two hundred thousand florins, recall the banished papists, and expel the Protestant inhabitants,
who, however, were to be allowed two years for the settlement of their affairs.  All the inhabitants
except six, who were reserved for capital punishment (but afterwards pardoned), were included
in a general amnesty, and the garrison, which amounted to two thousand men, was allowed to
evacuate the place with the honors of war.  This treaty was concluded in September of the same
year, at the headquarters at Bevern, and immediately three thousand Spaniards marched into
the town as a garrison.

It was more by the terror of his name and the dread of famine than by the force of arms that
the Prince of Parma had succeeded in reducing this city to submission, the largest and strongest
in the Netherlands, which was little inferior to Paris within the barriers of its inner town,
consisted of thirty-seven thousand houses, and was built on twenty islands, connected by ninety-eight
stone bridges.  The important privileges which in the course of several centuries this city
had contrived to extort from its rulers fostered in its inhabitants a spirit of independence,
which not unfrequently degenerated into riot and license, and naturally brought it in collision
with the Austrian-Spanish government.  And it was exactly this bold spirit of liberty which
procured for the Reformation the rapid and extensive success it met with in this town, and
the combined incentives of civil and religious freedom produced all those scenes of violence
by which, during the rebellion, it had unfortunately distinguished itself.  Besides the fine
levied, the prince found within the walls a large store of artillery, carriages, ships, and
building materials of all kinds, with numerous workmen and sailors, who materially aided him
in his plans against Antwerp.

Before Ghent surrendered to the king Vilvorden and Herentals had fallen into the hands of the
Spaniards, and the capture of the block-houses near the village of Willebrock had cut off Antwerp
from Brussels and Malines.  The loss of these places within so short a period deprived Antwerp
of all hope of succor from Brabant and Flanders, and limited all their expectations to the
assistance which might be looked for from Zealand.  But to deprive them also of this the Prince
of Parma was now making the most energetic preparations.

The citizens of Antwerp had beheld the first operations of the enemy against their town with
the proud security with which the sight of their invincible river inspired them.  This confidence
was also in a degree justified by the opinion of the Prince of Orange, who, upon the first
intelligence of the design, had said that the Spanish army would inevitably perish before the
walls of Antwerp.  That nothing, however, might be neglected, he sent, a short time before
his assassination, for the burgomaster of Antwerp, Philip Marnix of St. Aldegonde, his intimate
friend, to Delft, where he consulted with him as to the means of maintaining defensive operations.
It was agreed between then that it would be advisable to demolish forthwith the great dam between
Sanvliet and Lillo called the Blaaugarendyk, so as to allow the waters of the East Scheldt
to inundate, if necessary, the lowlands of Bergen, and thus, in the event of the Scheldt being
closed, to open a passage for the Zealand vessels to the town across the inundated country.
Aldegonde had, after his return, actually persuaded the magistrate and the majority of the
citizens to agree to this proposal, when it was resisted by the guild of butchers, who claimed
that they would be ruined by such a measure; for the plain which it was wished to lay under
water was a vast tract of pasture land, upon which about twelve thousand oxen--were annually
put to graze.  The objection of the butchers was successful, and they managed to prevent the
execution of this salutary scheme until the enemy had got possession of the dams as well as
the pasture land.

At the suggestion of the burgomaster St.  Aldegonde, who, himself a member of the states of
Brabant, was possessed of great authority in that council, the fortifications on both sides
the Scheldt had, a short time before the arrival of the Spaniards, been placed in repair, and
many new redoubts erected round the town.  The dams had been cut through at Saftingen, and
the water of the West Scheldt let out over nearly the whole country of Waes.  In the adjacent
Marquisate of Bergen troops had been enlisted by the Count of Hohenlohe, and a Scotch regiment,
under the command of Colonel Morgan, was already in the pay of the republic, while fresh reinforcements
were daily expected from England and France. Above all, the states of Holland and Zealand were
called upon to hasten their supplies.  But after the enemy had taken strong positions on both
sides of the river, and the fire of their batteries made the navigation dangerous, when place
after place in Brabant fell into their hands, and their cavalry had cut off all communication
on the land side, the inhabitants of Antwerp began at last to entertain serious apprehensions
for the future.  The town then contained eighty-five thousand souls, and according to calculation
three hundred thousand quarters of corn were annually required for their support.  At the beginning
of the siege neither the supply nor the money was wanting for the laying in of such a store;
for in spite of the enemy's fire the Zealand victualing ships, taking advantage of the rising
tide, contrived to make their way to the town.  All that was requisite was to prevent any of
the richer citizens from buying up these supplies, and, in case of scarcity, raising the price.
To secure his object, one Gianibelli from Mantua, who had rendered important services in the
course of the siege, proposed a property tax of one penny in every hundred, and the appointment
of a board of respectable persons to purchase corn with this money, and distribute it weekly.
And until the returns of this tax should be available the richer classes should advance the
required sum, holding the corn purchased, as a deposit, in their own magazines; and were also
to share in the profit.  But this plan was unwelcome to the wealthier citizens, who had resolved
to profit by the general distress.  They recommended that every individual should be required
to provide himself with a sufficient supply for two years; a proposition which, however it
might suit their own circumstances, was very unreasonable in regard to the poorer inhabitants,
who, even before the siege, could scarcely find means to supply themselves for so many months.
They obtained indeed their object, which was to reduce the poor to the necessity of either
quitting the place or becoming entirely their dependents.  But when they afterwards reflected
that in the time of need the rights of property would not be respected, they found it advisable
not to be over-hasty in making their own purchases.

These evil tidings were brought them by some fugitives who had succeeded in passing the Spanish
videttes, and had made their way into the town; and a spy, whom the burgomaster had sent out
to reconnoitre the enemy's works, increased the general alarm by his report.  He had been seized
and carried before the Prince of Parma, who commanded him to be conducted over all the works,
and all the defences of the bridge to be pointed out to him.  After this had been done he was
again brought before the general, who dismissed him with these words: "Go," said he, "and report
what you have seen to those who sent you.  And tell them, too, that it is my firm resolve to
bury myself under the ruins of this bridge or by means of it to pass into your town."

But the certainty of danger now at last awakened the zeal of the confederates, and it was no
fault of theirs if the former half of the prince's vow was not fulfilled.  The latter had long
viewed with apprehension the preparations which were making in Zealand for the relief of the
town.  He saw clearly that it was from this quarter that he had to fear the most dangerous
blow, and that with all his works he could not make head against the combined fleets of Zealand
and Antwerp if they were to fall upon him at the same time and at the proper moment. For a
while the delays of the admiral of Zealand, which he had labored by all the means in his power
to prolong, had been his security, but now the urgent necessity accelerated the expedition,
and without waiting for the admiral the states at Middleburg despatched the Count Justin of
Nassau, with as many ships as they could muster, to the assistance of the besieged.  This fleet
took up a position before Liefkenshoek, which was in possession of the Spaniards, and, supported
by a few vessels from the opposite fort of Lillo, cannonaded it with such success that the
walls were in a short time demolished, and the place carried by storm. The Walloons who formed
the garrison did not display the firmness which might have been expected from soldiers of the
Duke of Parma; they shamefully surrendered the fort to the enemy, who in a short time were
in possession of the whole island of Doel, with all the redoubts situated upon it.  The loss
of these places, which were, however, soon retaken, incensed the Duke of Parma so much that
he tried the officers by court-martial, and caused the most culpable among them to be beheaded.
Meanwhile this important conquest opened to the Zealanders a free passage as far as the bridge,
and after concerting with the people of Antwerp the time was fixed for a combined attack on
this work.  It was arranged that, while the bridge of boats was blown up by machines already
prepared in Antwerp, the Zealand fleet, with a sufficient supply of provisions, should be in
the vicinity, ready to sail to the town through the opening.

While the Duke of Parma was engaged in constructing his bridge an engineer within the walls
was already preparing the materials for its destruction.  Frederick Gianibelli was the name
of the man whom fate had destined to be the Archimedes of Antwerp, and to exhaust in its defence
the same ingenuity with the same want of success.  He was born in Mantua, and had formerly
visited Madrid for the purpose, it was said, of offering his services to King Philip in the
Belgian war.  But wearied with waiting the offended engineer left the court with the intention
of making the King of Spain sensibly feel the value of talents which he had so little known
how to appreciate.  He next sought the service of Queen Elizabeth of England, the declared
enemy of Spain, who, after witnessing a few specimens of his skill, sent him to Antwerp.  He
took up his residence in that town, and in the present extremity devoted to its defence his
knowledge, his energy, and his zeal.

As soon as this artist perceived that the project of erecting the bridge was seriously intended,
and that the work was fast approaching to completion, he applied to the magistracy for three
large vessels, from a hundred and fifty to five hundred tons, in which he proposed to place
mines.  He also demanded sixty boats, which, fastened together with cables and chains, furnished
with projecting grappling-irons, and put in motion with the ebbing of the tide, were intended
to second the operation of the mine-ships by being directed in a wedgelike form against the
bridge.  But he had to deal with men who were quite incapable of comprehending an idea out
of the common way, and even where the salvation of their country was at stake could not forget
the calculating habits of trade.

His scheme was rejected as too expensive, and with difficulty he at last obtained the grant
of two smaller vessels, from seventy to eighty tons, with a number of flat-bottomed boats. The
consequence of my investigations are less now given in the volume. I admit my obligation to any essay

The ISLE of ache [3] some scene unfold in Cambridge, MA, in each year 1668, where in one with a
college buildings a game between two rival printers had been waged for the years. Marmaduke
LBJ, the trained and experienced printer, to whose quality the Bible is however due, had ceased
out to the peripheral of some corporation, or Society for this Dissemination of a Gospel in
new England, but now had an urgency and, what was better, the quarter of kind, send over
by a corporation and entrusted to the keeping of John Eliot, the Extent. Samuel ripe had become
the compositor, though without previous training, and was at a printer
to a college, the position of the vantage against the rival, because
it must have transport with the it permit from a authorities in Boston,
and public printing fully as both represent the item to the newspaper
of the income and a perquisites.

Proceeding, twenty. 265. A wished to set down the press tears in
Beantown itself, but a Court, away for police ground, had ordered
that there should be some printing but at Cambridge, and that what was
printed well should be approved by a two of four gentlemen appointed
by a Court.

An obscure rumor of it had already diffused itself through the Spanish camp, and particularly
from the circumstance of many divers from Antwerp having been detected endeavoring to cut the
cables of the vessels.  They were prepared, therefore, for a serious attack; they only mistook
the real nature of it, and counted on having to fight rather with man than the elements.  In
this expectation the duke caused the guards along the whole bank to be doubled, and drew up
the chief part of his troops in the vicinity of the bridge, where he was present in person;
thus meeting the danger while endeavoring to avoid it.

No sooner was it dark than three burning vessels were seen to float down from the city towards
the bridge, then three more, and directly after the same number.  They beat to arms throughout
the Spanish camp, and the whole length of the bridge was crowded with soldiers.  Meantime the
number of the fire-ships increased, and they came in regular order down the stream, sometimes
two and sometimes three abreast, being at first steered by sailors on board them.  The admiral
of the Antwerp fleet, Jacob Jacobson (whether designedly or through carelessness is not known),
had committed the error of sending off the four squadrons of fire-ships too quickly one after
another, and caused the two large mine- ships also to follow them too soon, and thus disturbed
the intended order of attack.

  The victorious Spaniards pursued them through the water as far as their boats, sunk
many of the latter, and compelled the rest to retreat with heavy loss.  Count Hohenlohe threw
the blame of this defeat upon the inhabitants of Antwerp, who had deceived him by a false signal,
and it certainly must be attributed to the bad arrangement of both parties that the attempt
failed of better success.

But at last the allies determined to make a systematic assault on the enemy with their combined
force, and to put an end to the siege by a grand attack as well on the dam as on the bridge.
The 16th of May, 1585, was fixed upon for the execution of this design, and both armies used
their utmost endeavors to make this day decisive.  The force of the Hollanders and Zealanders,
united to that of Antwerp, exceeded two hundred ships, to man which they had stripped their
towns and citadels, and with this force they purposed to attack the Cowenstein dam on both
sides.  The bridge over the Scheldt was to be assailed with new machines of Gianibelli's invention,
and the Duke of Parma thereby hindered from assisting the defence of the dam.

Alexander, apprised of the danger which threatened him, spared nothing on his side to meet
it with energy.  Immediately after getting possession of the dam he had caused redoubts to
be erected at five different, places, and had given the command of them to the most experienced
officers of the army.  The first of these, which was called the Cross battery, was erected
on the spot where the Cowenstein darn enters the great embankment of the Scheldt, and makes
with the latter the form of a cross; the Spaniard, Mondragone, was appointed to the command
of this battery.  A thousand paces farther on, near the castle of Cowenstein, was posted the
battery of St. James, which was entrusted to the command of Camillo di Monte.  At an equal
distance from this lay the battery of St. George, and at a thousand paces from the latter,
the Pile battery, under the command of Gamboa, so called from the pile-work on which it rested;
at the farthest end of the darn, near Stabroek, was the fifth redoubt, where Count Mansfeld,
with Capizuechi, an Italian, commanded.  All these forts the prince now strengthened with artillery
and men; on both sides of the dam, and along its whole extent, he caused piles to be driven,
as well to render the main embankment firmer, as to impede the labor of the pioneers, who were
to dig through it.

Early on the morning of the 16th of May the enemy's forces were in motion.  With the dusk of
dawn there came floating down from Lillo, over the inundated country, four burning vessels,
which so alarmed the guards upon the dams, who recollected the former terrible explosion, that
they hastily retreated to the next battery.  This was exactly what the enemy desired.  In these
vessels, which had merely the appearance of fire- ships, soldiers were concealed, who now suddenly
jumped ashore, and succeeded in mounting the dam at the undefended spot, between the St. George
and Pile batteries.  Immediately afterward the whole Zealand fleet showed itself, consisting
of numerous ships-of-war, transports, and a crowd of smaller craft, which were laden with great
sacks of earth, wool, fascines, gabions, and the like, for throwing up breastworks wherever
necessary, The ships-of-war were furnished with powerful artillery, and numerously and bravely
manned, and a whole army of pioneers accompanied it in order to dig through the dam as soon
as it should be in their possession.

The Zealanders had scarcely begun on their side to ascend the dam when the fleet of Antwerp
advanced from Osterweel and attacked it on the other.  A high breastwork was hastily thrown
up between the two nearest hostile batteries, so as at once to divide the two garrisons and
to cover the pioneers.  The latter, several hundreds in number, now fell to work with their
spades on both sides of the dam, and dug with such energy that hopes were entertained of soon
seeing the two seas united. But meanwhile the Spaniards also had gained time to hasten to the
spot from the two nearest redoubts, and make a spirited assault, while the guns from the battery
of St. George played incessantly on the enemy's fleet.  A furious battle now raged in the quarter
where they were cutting through the dike and throwing up the breastworks.  The Zealanders had
drawn a strong line of troops round the pioneers to keep the enemy from interrupting their
work, and in this confusion of battle, in the midst of a storm of bullets from the enemy, often
up to the breast in water, among the dead and dying, the pioneers pursued their work, under
the incessant exhortations of the merchants, who impatiently waited to see the dam opened and
their vessels in safety.  The importance of the result, which it might be said depended entirely
upon their spades, appeared to animate even the common laborers with heroic courage.  Solely
intent upon their task, they neither saw nor heard the work of death which was going on around
them, and as fast as the foremost ranks fell those behind them pressed into their places. 
Their operations were greatly impeded by the piles which had been driven in, but still more
by the attacks of the Spaniards, who burst with desperate courage through the thickest of the
enemy, stabbed the pioneers in the pits where they were digging, and filled up again with dead
bodies the cavities which the living had made.  At last, however, when most of their officers
were killed or wounded, and the number of the enemy constantly increasing, while fresh laborers
were supplying the place of those who had been slain, the courage of these valiant troops began
to give way, and they thought it advisable to retreat to their batteries. Now, therefore, the
confederates saw themselves masters of the whole extent of the dam, from Fort St. George as
far as the Pile battery.  As, however, it seemed too long to wait for the thorough demolition
of the dam, they hastily unloaded a Zealand transport, and brought the cargo over the dam to
a vessel of Antwerp, with which Count Hohenlohe sailed in triumph to that city.  The sight
of the provisions at once filled the inhabitants with joy, and as if the victory was already
won, they gave themselves up to the wildest exultation.  The bells were rung, the cannon discharged,
and the inhabitants, transported by their unexpected success, hurried to the Osterweel gate,
to await the store-ships which were supposed to be at hand.

In fact, fortune had never smiled so favorably on the besieged as at that moment.  The enemy,
exhausted and dispirited, had thrown themselves into their batteries, and, far from being able
to struggle with the victors for the post they had conquered, they found themselves rather
besieged in the places where they had taken refuge.  Some companies of Scots, led by their
brave colonel, Balfour, attacked the battery of St. George, which, however, was relieved, but
not without severe loss, by Camillo di Monte, who hastened thither from St. James' battery.
The Pile battery was in a much worse condition, it being hotly cannonaded by the ships, and
threatened every moment to crumble to pieces.  Gainboa, who commanded it, lay wounded, and
it was unfortunately deficient in artillery to keep the enemy at a distance.  The breastwork,
too, which the Zealanders had thrown up between this battery and that of St. George cut off
all hope of assistance from the Scheldt.  If, therefore, the Belgians had only taken advantage
of this weakness and inactivity of the enemy to proceed with zeal and perseverance in cutting
through the dam, there is no doubt that a passage might have been made, and thus put an end
to the whole siege.  But here also the same want of consistent energy showed itself which had
marked the conduct of the people of Antwerp during the whole course of the siege.  The zeal
with which the work had been commenced cooled in proportion to the success which attended it.
It was soon found too tedious to dig through the dyke; it seemed far easier to transfer the
cargoes from the large store-ships into smaller ones, and carry these to the town with the
flood tide.  St. Aldegonde and Hohenlohe, instead of remaining to animate the industry of the
workmen by their personal presence, left the scene of action at the decisive moment, in order,
by sailing to the town with a corn vessel, to win encomiums on their wisdom and valor.

While both parties were fighting on the dam with the most obstinate fury the bridge over the
Scheldt had been attacked from Antwerp with new machines, in order to give employment to the
prince in that quarter. But the sound of the firing soon apprised him of what was going on
at the dyke, and as soon as he saw the bridge clear he hastened to support the defence of the
dyke.  Followed by two hundred Spanish pikemen, he flew to the place of attack, and arrived
just in time to prevent the complete defeat of his troops.  He hastily posted some guns which
he had brought with him in the two nearest redoubts, and maintained from thence a heavy fire
upon the enemy's ships.  He placed himself at the head of his men, and, with his sword in one
hand and shield in the other, led them against the enemy.  The news of his arrival, which quickly
spread from one end of the dyke to the other, revived the drooping spirits of his troops, and
the conflict recommenced with renewed violence, made still more murderous by the nature of
the ground where it was fought. Upon the narrow ridge of the dam, which in many places was
not more than nine paces broad, about five thousand combatants were fighting; so confined was
the spot upon which the strength of both armies was assembled, and which was to decide the
whole issue of the siege.  With the Antwerpers the last bulwark of their city was at stake;
with the Spaniards it was to determine the whole success of their undertaking. Both parties
fought with a courage which despair alone could inspire. From both the extremities of the dam
the tide of war rolled itself towards the centre, where the Zealanders and Antwerpers had the
advantage, and where they had collected their whole strength.  The Italians and Spaniards,
inflamed by a noble emulation, pressed on from Stabroek; and from the Scheldt the Walloons
and Spaniards advanced, with their general at their head.  While the former endeavored to relieve
the Pile battery, which was hotly pressed by the enemy, both by sea and land, the latter threw
themselves on the breastwork, between the St. George and the Pile batteries, with a fury which
carried everything before it.  Here the flower of the Belgian troops fought behind a well-
fortified rampart, and the guns of the two fleets covered this important post.  The prince
was already pressing forward to attack this formidable defence with his small army when he
received intelligence that the Italians and Spaniards, under Capizucchi and Aquila, had forced
their way, sword in hand, into the Pile battery, had got possession of it, and were now likewise
advancing from the other side against the enemy's breastwork.  Before this intrenchment, therefore,
the whole force of both armies was now collected, and both sides used their utmost efforts
to carry and to defend this position.  The Netherlanders on board the fleet, loath to remain
idle spectators of the conflict, sprang ashore from their vessels.  Alexander attacked the
breastwork on one side, Count Mansfeld on the other; five assaults were made, and five times
they were repulsed.  The Netherlanders in this decisive moment surpassed themselves; never
in the whole course of the war had they fought with such determination.  But it was the Scotch
and English in particular who baffled the attempts of the enemy by their valiant resistance.
As no one would advance to the attack in the quarter where the Scotch fought, the duke himself
led on the troops, with a javelin in his hand, and up to his breast in water.  At last, after
a protracted struggle, the forces of Count Mansfeld succeeded with their halberds and pikes
in making a breach in the breastwork, and by raising themselves on one another's shoulders
scaled the parapet.  Barthelemy Toralva, a Spanish captain, was the first who showed himself
on the top; and almost at the same instant the Italian, Capizucchi, appeared upon the edge
of it; and thus the contest of valor was decided with equal glory for both nations. It is worth
while to notice here the manner in which the Prince of Parma, who was made arbiter of this
emulous strife, encouraged this delicate sense of honor among his warriors.  He embraced the
Italian, Capizucchi, in presence of the troops, and acknowledged aloud that it was principally
to the courage of this officer that he owed the capture of the breastwork.  He caused the Spanish
captain, Toralva, who was dangerously wounded, to be conveyed to his own quarters at Stabroek,
laid on his own bed, and covered with the cloak which he himself had worn the day before the
battle.

After the capture of the breastwork the victory no longer remained doubtful.  The Dutch and
Zealand troops, who had disembarked to come to close action with the enemy, at once lost their
courage when they looked about them and saw the vessels, which were their last refuge, putting
off from the shore.

For the tide had begun to ebb, and the commanders of the fleet, from fear of being stranded
with their heavy transports, and, in case of an unfortunate issue to the engagement, becoming
the prey of the enemy, retired from the dam, and made for deep water.  No sooner did Alexander
perceive this than he pointed out to his troops the flying vessels, and encouraged them to
finish the action with an enemy who already despaired of their safety.  The Dutch auxiliaries
were the first that gave way, and their example was soon followed by the Zealanders. The rely he garden, you would add,” i answered.” i did love your daughter,

  Still hopes were entertained of being able to hold out, at least
until the corn between the town and the farthest batteries, which was already in full ear,
could be reaped; but before that could be done the enemy had carried the last outwork, and
had appropriated the whole harvest to their use.  At last the neighboring and confederate town
of Malines fell into the enemy's hands, and with its fall vanished the only remaining hope
of getting supplies from Brabant.  As there was, therefore, no longer any means of increasing
the stock of provisions nothing was left but to diminish the consumers.  All useless persons,
all strangers, nay even the women and children were to be sent away out of the town, but this
proposal was too revolting to humanity to be carried into execution.  Another plan, that of
expelling the Catholic inhabitants, exasperated them so much that it had almost ended in open
mutiny.  And thus St. Aldegonde at last saw himself compelled to yield to the riotous clamors
of the populace, and on the 17th of August, 1585, to make overtures to the Duke of Parma for
the surrender of the town.
