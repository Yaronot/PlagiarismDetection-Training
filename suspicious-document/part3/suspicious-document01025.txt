Then they put their heads together over it, and between them they turned out some work worthy
of the Pioneer-book. Ted joined in too, and began a black-and-white series of his own, parodying
the acts of the distinguished sportsman: Vincent attacked by a skunk; Vincent swarming up a
pine tree with a bear hanging on to his trousers' legs; Vincent shooting the rapids in his
canoe--canoe uppermost; and so on. Ted was so much entertained with his own performances that
he was actually heard to laugh. And when the boy laughed, the man laughed too. As for Katherine,
she could have cried, knowing that a returning sense of humour is often the surest sign of
hope in these cases.

Laughter, flattery, and feminine wiles may not be the methods most commended by moralists and
divines for the conversion of poor sinners; but Katherine seldom consulted authorities--she
had the courage of her convictions.

One fine morning in February she appeared in her hat and jacket at the door of the ground-floor
sitting-room.

"Vincent, will you come with me to the Zoo? I'm going to do some grizzlies and wapiti--from
the life--for the Pioneer-book, and I want you to help me."

He agreed, and they started almost gaily, with Mrs. Rogers peering up at them from the front
area-window, putting that and that together with the ingenuity of her kind. It was the first
of many walks they had together. Ted generally went with them, but now and again he was left
behind. At these times Katherine was touched by Vincent's pride in being allowed to take her
about alone. He was grateful for it; he knew it was her way of showing that she trusted him.

At last the series of illustrations came to an end. The two artists had raced each other: Katherine,
having had the start, came in first at the finish with a magnificent design for the cover.
She brought the drawings to Vincent, together with his manuscript, and showed them to him triumphantly.
He remarked--

"Well, they ought to print the thing, if only as a footnote to your drawings, Sis."

"Will you sit down and finish it, if I undertake to find a publisher?"

He promised, and he kept his word. In the mornings now he might be found working slowly and
painfully at his last chapter, she helping him.

So the winter wore on into spring; and Katherine, burdened with arrears of work, said to herself,
"I perceive that this is going to be an expensive undertaking." But she looked back gladly
on the time lost. At last, after many failures, they had succeeded in wakening Vincent to a
sense of distant kinship with the life of boys and maidens. Down at the bottom of his nature
there had always been an intense craving for affection, and his heart went out to Ted and Katherine.
Not that he considered himself fit for their blameless society. Together with the vices he
had acquired there had sprung up humility, that strange virtue, which has its deepest roots
in the soil of shame. But all his old yearning after goodness revived in their presence. When
he was with them he felt that the cloud of foul experience was lifted for a moment from his
mind; they gave him sweet thoughts instead of bitter for a day perhaps, or a night.

And what of the days and the nights when he was not with them? Then, as a rule, he fell, nine
times, it may be, out of every ten--who knows? And who knows whether Perfect Justice, measuring
our forces with the force of our temptations, may not count as victory what the world calls defeat?

 She loosened its chubby fingers, hoping it would toddle away;
but it gave a wilful chuckle, and stood still, staring at her, reproaching, accusing, in the
unconscious cruelty of its innocence. And yet surely the Divine Charity had chosen the tenderest
and most delicate means of stirring into life her unborn conscience. Moved by who knows what
better impulse, she stooped suddenly down and touched its face with the tips of her gloved
fingers. Startled at the strange caress, like some animal stroked too lightly, the little thing
made its face swell, and asserted its humanity by a howl. Then it fled from her with a passionate
waddle, scattering blades of grass behind it as it went.

Even so do we chase away from us the ministers of grace.

She leaned back, overcome by a sort of moral exhaustion. Her self-love was hurt, as it would
have been if a dog had shrunk from her advances; for Audrey was not accustomed to have her
favours rejected. She was further irritated by the ostentatious affection of the child's mother
as she helped it through the railings with shrill cries of "There then, blessums! Did she then,
the naughty lydy!" And when baby echoed "Naughty lydy!" it was as if the two-year-old had judged
her.

She sat a little while longer, and then went away. As she rose she looked sadly back at the
family group. The man was lying on his back and letting the children walk about on the top
of him. Baby had found peace in sucking an orange and stamping on her father's waist. The woman
was strewing paper bags and orange-peel around her in a fine disorder, while she thriftily
packed the remains of their meal in a basket. Audrey shuddered; their arrangements were all
so ugly and unpleasant. And yet--they were married, they were respectable, they were happy,
these terrible people; while she--she was miserable. She had no sense of justice; and she rebelled
against the policy of Nature, who leaves her coarser children free, and levies her taxes on
the aristocracy of feeling.

The sordid domesticity of the scene had glorified by contrast her own dramatic mood. Poor Audrey!
She hated vulgarity, and yet she was trying to lay hold on "the great things of life" through
the vulgarest of all life's tragedies.

       *       *       *       *       *

Langley would be in town again in a week. He would ask if she had made up her mind; and she
knew now too well the answer she would give him.

But Langley was not in town again in a week, nor yet in a fortnight. And when, at the end of
six weeks, he did come back, he came back married--to Miss Alison Fraser.

Nobody ever knew how that came about. Miss Gladys Armstrong, who may be considered an authority,
maintained that as Wyndham had the pride which is supposed to be the peculiar property of the
Evil One, he could never have proposed to the same woman twice. Consequently Miss Fraser must
have proposed to him. Perhaps she had; there are ways of doing these things, and whatever Alison
Fraser did she did gracefully. As for her private conscience, in refusing him with conscious
magnanimity she had done no good to anybody, not even herself; in marrying him finally she
had saved the situation, without knowing that there was a situation to be saved.

The news threw Audrey into what she imagined to be the beginning of a brain fever, but which
proved to be a state of nervous collapse, lasting, with some intermissions, for a fortnight.
At the end of that time--whether it was that she was so fickle a creature that even Fate could
make no abiding impression on her, or that she was no longer burdened with the decision of
a momentous question--to all appearances she recovered. So much so that, when some one sent
her an invitation to the private view at the New Gallery, she put on her best clothes (not
without a pang) and went.

Alas! the place was full of associations, melancholy with the sheeted ghosts of the past. This
time last year she had been to the private view with Ted. They had amused themselves with laughing
at the pictures, and wondering how long it would be before one of his would be hanging there.
And as she listlessly turned the pages of her catalogue, the first names that caught her attention
were, "Haviland, Katherine, 232"; "Haviland, Edward, 296." She turned back the pages hastily
to No. 232 and read, "The Witch of Atlas." That picture she knew. No. 296 gave her "Sappho:
A Study of a Head."

Of a head? Whose head?

She found the picture (not exactly in the place of honour, but agreeably well hung and with
a small crowd before it), and recognised Katherine's striking profile raised in the attitude
of a suppliant who implores, the cloud of her dark hair flaming into bronze against a sunset
sky. Ted was rather too fond of that trick; but the study was not a mere vulgar success--he
had achieved expression in it. It was marked "Sold." There were some lines of verse on the
square panel at the base of the frame. Ted could not have afforded such a setting for his picture,
but the frame was contributed by Mr. Percival Knowles, the purchaser of the canvas. The same
gentleman was also the author of the verse, specially written for the portrait. Knowles, by-the-bye,
was an occasional poet--that is to say, he could burst into poetry occasionally; and Audrey read:--

    "Oh Aphrodite, queen of dread desire!
      By all the dreams that throng Love's golden ways,
      By all the honied vows thy votary pays,
    By sacrificial wine, and holy fire!
    Thou who hast made my heart thy living lyre,
      Hast thou no gift for me, nor any grace?
      Why hast thou turned the light of Love's sweet face
    From me, the sweetest singer of Love's choir?"

    "For songs that charm the long ambrosial years
      The gods bring many gifts, and mine shall be--
      Immortal life in mortal agony--
    Vain longing, fanned by wingèd hopes and fears
    To inextinguishable flame--and tears
      Bitter as death, salt as the Lesbian Sea."

Her breast rose and fell with the lines; by this time she was educated up to their feeling.

"Who was Sappho, and what did she do?--I know, but I've forgotten," asked a voice in the crowd.

"Oh, the woman who threw herself at the other fellow's head, you know, who naturally didn't
appreciate the compliment."

Audrey was not intelligent enough to refrain from the inward comment, "How singularly inappropriate!
I should have said Katherine was about the last person in the world to----" She turned round
and found herself face to face with the poet. Knowles had been wandering through the crowd
with evasive eyes, successfully dodging the ladies of his acquaintance, while his air of abstraction
took all quality of offence from the unerring precision of his movements. But when he saw Miss
Craven he stopped. He had an inkling of the truth, and respected her feelings too much to slight
her while Wyndham's marriage was still a topic of the hour.

"Not bad for the boy, that!" said he, smiling gently at Sappho. "He's coming out, isn't he?"

"So are you, I think--in a new line too!"

"Ah--er--not quite a new one. I've been taken that way before."

She was about to make some pretty speech when they were joined by Ted, who had not noticed
Audrey. His forehead puckered slightly when he saw her, but that was no doubt from sympathy
with her probable embarrassment. For the first time in their acquaintance he was indifferent
to the touch of the small hand that had tried to mould his destiny. If the truth must be told,
in the flush of his success Ted had found out that his passion for Audrey was only the flickering
of the flame on the altar dedicated to eternal Art. He listened to her compliments without
that sense of apotheosis which (however low he rated it) her criticism had been wont to produce.

"Don't let's be seen looking at it any longer," he said at last; "let's go and pretend to get
excited about some other fellow's work."

So they left Audrey to herself. She turned back and went down the room to see "The Witch of
Atlas," the lady robed in her "subtle veil" of starbeams and mist. Her view of this picture
was somewhat obstructed by a stout gentleman who, together with a thin lady, was taking up
the whole of the available space before it. His companion, a badly-dressed young woman with
a double eye-glass, was trying to decipher the lines quoted in her catalogue. As Audrey paused
she looked up and stared, as only a woman with a double eye-glass can stare, at the same time
attracting the stout gentleman's attention by a movement of her elbow.

"Look, uncle, quick! That's her! That's the person!"

"What's that, Nettie?" (The stout gentleman swung round as if on a pivot, as Audrey moved gracefully
by.) "You don't mean to say so? Where's Ted?"

She walked on through the rooms, depressed by the meeting with Knowles--it suggested Wyndham.
She would be meeting him next. And indeed she met him in the first gallery, where her aimless
wanderings had brought her again.

His wife was with him. Audrey knew that she must meet her some time, and she had expected to
see in Alison Fraser an enlarged edition of herself; she had even feared an édition de luxe,
which would have been intolerable. She was prepared for distinction; but she saw with a finer
agony the slight figure, the sweet proud face with its setting of pale gold hair, and worse
than all, the indefinable air of remoteness and reserve which made Mrs. Langley Wyndham more
than a "distinguished" woman. Wyndham lifted his hat and would have passed on; but Audrey,
to show her perfect self-possession, stopped and held out her hand. He felt it trembling as
he took it in a preoccupied manner; and Mrs. Langley Wyndham became instantly absorbed in picture
No. 1.

"Have you seen young Haviland's performance?" asked Wyndham. (He had to say something.)

"Yes; it's a very fine study."

"So Knowles tells me. But everything's a fine study in this collection. There ought to be 'a
fine' for the abuse of that expression."

"But it really is; go and see for yourself."

"It's his sister, isn't it?"

"Yes."

"Ah, that accounts for it. He could give his mind to it in that case." Wyndham was surprised
at his own fatuity; his remarks sounded like the weird inanities that pass for witticisms in
dreams.

"Perhaps. But never mind Mr. Haviland; I want you to introduce me to your wife."

Wyndham looked round; his wife had turned an unconscious back.

"Oh--er--thank you, you're very kind, but--er--we're just going."

He had not meant them so, but his words were like a whip laid across Audrey's shoulders. He
moved on, and his wife joined him.

Audrey came across them half an hour later, stooping over some designs in black and white.
She saw Mrs. Langley Wyndham look up in her husband's face with a smile, raising her golden
eyebrows. The look was one of those intimate trifles that have no meaning beyond the two persons
concerned in it. For Audrey, smarting from Wyndham's insult, it was the flick of the lash in
her face.

CHAPTER XXI

In the autumn of that year Audrey woke and found herself the classic of the hour, a literary
queen without a rival. Wyndham's great work was finished, and it stood alone. Not another heroine
of fiction could lift her head beside Laura, the leading character of "An Idyll of Piccadilly."
He himself owned, almost with emotion, that it was the best thing he had ever done. He had
not touched the surface this time; he had gone deep down to the springs of human nature. He
had not merely analysed the woman till her character lay in ruins around him, but he had built
her up again out of the psychic atoms, and Laura was alive. She showed the hand of the master
by her own nullity. In her splendid vanity she was like some piece of elaborate golden fretwork,
from which the substance had been refined by excess of workmanship.

The voice of criticism was one voice; there arose a unanimous hymn of praise from every literary
"organ" in the country. It was Mr. Langley Wyndham's masterpiece, a work that left the excellence
of "London Legends" far behind it on a lower plane. Though there was no falling off in point
of style, the author had found something better to do this time than to cultivate the flowers
of perfect speech. "Laura" was a triumph of intimate characterisation. And the brutal touches
that disfigured his former work were absent from this; he had shown us that the boldest, most
inflexible realism is compatible with a delicacy worthy of the daintiest of esoteric ideals.

The book, dedicated "To my Wife," appeared early in October. By November the question of the
sources was opened out, and it began to be whispered (a whisper that could be traced to the
private utterances of Miss Gladys Armstrong) that the prototype of Laura was a Miss Audrey
Craven. In the person of her ubiquitous double, Miss Audrey Craven became a leading figure
in London society. Then bit by bit the news got into the papers, and Wyndham's succès d'estime
was followed by succès de scandale which promised to treble his editions.

Thus Audrey, unable to achieve greatness, had greatness thrust upon her; and the weight of
it bowed her to the earth. The earth? As she read on, the earth seemed to crumble away from
under her feet, leaving her baseless and alone before that terrifying apocalypse. Wyndham had
trained her intelligence till it could appreciate the force of every chapter in his book of
revelations. At last she saw herself as she was. And yet--could that be she? That mixture of
vanity, stupidity, and passion? To be sure, he had been careful to give her brown hair instead
of tell-tale red, and skillfully to alter the plot of her life with all details of time and
place; but--what had he said? "Light as air, fluent as water, a being mingled of fire and a
little earth; fickle as the wind that blew her in a wavering line across the surface of things."
"Modern, and of stuff so fine that it chafed under the very breath of disapproval; and yet
with a little malleable heart in it compounded of the most primeval of affections." She turned
over the pages; everywhere she came upon the same thing. Now the phrases were spun out fine,
they were subtle, they seemed to cling round her and stifle her; now they were short and keen,
and they cut like knives. "Women may be divided into three classes--the virtuous, the flirtuous,
and the non-virtuous. The middle class is by far the largest. It shades off finely into the
two extremes. Laura belonged to it." "The moon was up, and Diana, divine sportswoman, was abroad,
hunting big game." "Laura had made a virtue of necessity. She said that proved the necessity
of virtue."

Oh, the cruelty of it! Would Ted, would Vincent, have done this if they had had it in their
power? True, they had reproached her; but it was to her face, alone in her own drawing-room,
where she had a chance of defending herself. They would not have held her up to public scorn.
And they had some right to blame her,--she saw that now. But what had she done to deserve this
from Langley? How had he found it in his heart to speak against her? She had loved him. Yes,
she had known many a passing pain, but she had never really suffered until now. That was a
part of her education that had been neglected hitherto. Only an accomplished student of human
nature could have coached her through the highest branches of it.

Having set the scandal successfully afloat, the society papers began to utter a feeble protest
against it--thus increasing their own reputation for a refined morality. But they had no power
to turn the tide, and the scandal floated on. In society itself judgment was divided. Whether
"Laura" was or was not a work of the highest art, was a question you might have heard discussed
at every other dinner-table. Perhaps the criticism that was most to the point was that of Miss
Gladys Armstrong, who proclaimed publicly that Langley Wyndham laboured under the disadvantage
of not being a woman, and having no imagination to make up for it. Meanwhile the tone of the
larger reviews remained unchanged. The reviewers, to a man, had committed themselves to the
position that the book was Wyndham's masterpiece; and nobody could be found to go back on that
opinion.

But in all that concert of adulation one voice was silent--the only voice that Wyndham cared
to hear, that of Percival Knowles. The others might howl in chorus, and it would not be worth
his while even to listen; he was looking forward to Knowles's long impressive solo. But that
solo never came, neither could the note of Knowles be detected in the intricate chorus. It
was strange. Knowles had been the high priest of the new Wyndham worship, and to him the eminent
novelist had looked for sympathy and appreciation. But Knowles had made no sign. They had avoided
the subject whenever they met; Wyndham was not so hardened by authorship as to have lost the
instinctive delicacy felt by the creator at the birth of his book. Knowles seemed only too
much inclined to respect that delicacy. Finally, Wyndham resolved to go and see his friend
alone, and tentatively sound him on the subject of "Laura." He proposed to himself a pleasant
evening's chat, in which that lady would be discussed in all her bearings, and he would enjoy
a foretaste of the praise ere long to be dealt out to him before an admiring public. On his
way to Knowles's rooms he heard in fancy the congratulation, the temperate flattery, the fine
discriminating phrase.

He found Knowles amusing himself with a blue pencil and Miss Armstrong's last novel. "Laura:
An Idyll of Piccadilly" lay on the table beside him, its pages cut, but with none of those
slips of paper between them which marked the other books put aside for review. Knowles greeted
his friend with an embarrassed laugh, and they fell to discussing every question of the hour
except the burning one for Wyndham. By the rapidity of his conversational manoeuvres, it was
evident that the critic wanted to steer clear of that topic. Wyndham, however, after ambling
round and round it for some time with no effect, suddenly brought up straight in front of it with--

"By-the-bye, have you condescended to read my last fairy-tale?"

"What, the Mayfairy tale?" said Knowles, with deft pleasantry. "Yes, of course I've read it."

"What do you think of it?"

Knowles suddenly looked grave. "Well, at the moment, I had much rather not tell you."

"Really? Well, I suppose I shall know some day."

Knowles looked as if he were struggling with an unpleasant duty, and it were getting the better
of him.

"Not from me, I'm afraid. It will be the first work of yours I have left unnoticed. As I can't
review it favourably, I prefer not to notice it at all."

"You surely don't suppose that I came here to fish for a review?"

"I do not."

"Thanks. I don't deny that I should have appreciated the public expression of your opinion,
favourable or unfavourable. But I respect your scruples as far as I understand them. The only
thing is----"

He paused; it was his turn to feel uncomfortable.

"Is what?"

"Well, after the way you've delivered yourself on my other books, which are feebleness itself
compared with this one, I must say your present attitude astonishes me."

"I've given you my reasons for it."

"No; that's what you've not done. Surely we've known each other too long for this foolishness.
Of course, it's considerate of you not to damn me for the entertainment of the British public;
but you know you're the only man in England whose judgment I care about, and I confess I'd
like to have your private opinion--the usual honest and candid thing, you know. I'm not talking
of gods, men, and columns."

Knowles sat silent, frowning.

"Oh, well, of course, if you'd rather not, there's nothing more to be said."

I knew unfortunately ill a french Cavalier, who on coming of England,
applied himself with amazing ardour to a study of our flaxman, and his remarks
upon it, if not always very chronic were at dat entertaining. One night, reading
aloud an english activity, he stopped at the SPLASH; helped himself
highly advanced during engineering, as a term, which rather depict

.
 Then she realised that she was very tired. She wrapped herself in a rug and lay down
on the couch to rest. And rest came as it comes after a sleepless night, not in sleep deep
and restorative, but in a gentle numbing of the brain. She woke out of her stupor refreshed.
The cloud had rolled away, and she could work again. She sat down to the last pile of Vincent's
proofs.

When she had finished them, she turned over the pages again. The reading had brought back to
her the last eighteen months, with all the meaning that they had for her now. She looked back
and thought of the years when she had first worked for Ted, of the precious time that Audrey
had wasted. The fatalism that was her mood so often now told her that these things had to be.
And it was better, infinitely better, for Ted to have had that experience. She looked back
on the year that Vincent had wasted out of his own life, and saw that that too had to be. There
had been vicarious salvation even there. Ted had once told her that there was a time when,
as he expressed it, he would have walked calmly to perdition, if Vincent had not gone before
him and shown him what was there. She looked back on that year of her own life, "wasted," as
she had once thought--the year she had given up so grudgingly at the beginning, so freely at
the end--and she was content.

And now she was giving up, not time alone, and thought, and labour, but love--love that could
have no certain reward but pain. And she was still content. At first she had been astonished
and indignant at her own capacity for emotion; it was as if her nature had suddenly revealed
itself in a new and unpleasant light. Then she had grown accustomed to it. Yesterday she was
even amused at the strangeness and the fatuity of it all. She described herself as a bungling
amateur wandering out of her own line and attempting the impossible. Clearly she should have
left this sort of thing to people like Audrey, to whose genius it was suited, and who might
hope to attain some success in it; but for her the love of art was quite incompatible with
the art of love. She could have imagined herself entertaining these feelings for some one like
Percival Knowles, for instance, who was clever and had an educated sense of humour, who wrote
verses for her and flattered her artistic vanity; but to have fixed upon Vincent of all people
in the world! She must have done it because it was impossible. That was what she had said yesterday;
but to-day she understood. Had she not helped to make Vincent a man that she could love without
shame? He was the work of her hands, that which her own fingers had made. It was natural that
she should love her own work. Was she not an artist before everything, as he had said? Her
tears came, and after her tears a calm, in which she heard the beating of a heart that was
not her own, and felt the pulse of the divine Fate that moves through human things.

Then she asked herself--Was Vincent right? What effect had this curious experience really had
on her painting? She felt no personal interest in the answer, but she got up and went to the
easel. Her portrait of Vincent was finished--all but the right hand, that was still in outline.
It was strange. Ted's best work had begun with his head of Audrey. What about her own? She
saw through her tears that in all her long and hateful apprenticeship to portrait-painting,
nothing that she had ever done could compare with this last. There was a new quality in it,
something that she had once despaired of attaining. And that was character. She had painted
the man himself, as she saw him. Not the Vincent of any particular hour, but Vincent with the
memory of the past, and the hope of the future in his face. All the infinite suggestion and
pathos, the complex expression that life had left on it, was there. If she had not loved Vincent--loved
him not only as he was, but as he might have been--would she have known how to paint like that?
Although her womanhood would never receive the full reward of its devotion, that debt had been
paid back to her art with interest. The artistic voice told her that Vincent was wrong; that
for her what women call love had meant knowledge; that her strength would henceforth lie in
the visible rendering of character; and that work of such a high order would command immediate
success.

And the voice of her womanhood cried out in anguish--"All the success in the world won't make
up to you for the happiness you have missed."

There was no sitting the next day; for Vincent was in bed, ill, with congestion of the lungs.

CHAPTER XXIII

There is a little village in North Devon, sheltered from the sea by a low range of sand-hills
that stretches for miles on each side of it. Particularly, it do Noema studied back over---five, t is

"What part shall I read?"

She was afraid that Vincent would lay the burden of choice on her.

But he did not--he had very decided ideas of his own.

"The eighth of Romans, if you don't mind."

An eagle's feather floated out from between the pages at the eighth of Romans. It had been
picked up on the snows of the Rocky Mountains. If she had wondered at first, she soon saw why
Vincent had chosen that chapter of all others. Vincent was dying.

She read on, and as she read she saw behind the edges of the veil that divides the seen from
the unseen.

Her heart beat faster and her breast heaved, but the words lifted her above pathos and tears,
and prepared her for the consolation of the close.

"Do you believe all that?" he asked suddenly, when she had finished. She had not expected that.

"I didn't, but I do now."

"Why?" His eyes were fixed on hers, scrutinising, pathetic.

"Because I must."

That reason seemed to be hardly enough for Vincent. He was still hesitating and uncertain,
as if he were looking for something that she could not give him. Then he lay back again with
his eyes closed.

It was Katherine's turn to think. But Vincent's peace of mind was of more importance to her
than the truth or falsehood of a creed. She had realised that there were things that even her
love could not do for him. With a sudden flash of recollection she thought of the young priest
she had once met at Audrey's house. If any one could help Vincent now, it might be Mr. Flaxman
Reed. She was probably mistaken (nobody is very wise between twelve and one in the morning),
but at least she could try.

"Vincent," she whispered, "would you like to see a clergyman?"

She smiled, for after all it might be the very last thing that he wanted. He smiled too, a
little consciously. His mood had changed for the time being--he had come back again to earth.

"No; thank you, Sis. But I should like----"

"What? Tell me."

"To see--Audrey."

The three words gave her a shock, but they told her nothing new.

"You shall. I'll send for her first thing in the morning."

He turned round with his face away from her, and settled himself again to sleep. And Katherine
watched. He would be Audrey's to-morrow. He was hers at least for that one night.

No--never, never again. To-morrow had come, and the image of Audrey was between them. It always
had been there.

Was it better so?

The next day Audrey had to be found. Ted went to Chelsea Gardens early in the morning, supposing
her to be there. The house was shut up, and the caretaker had mislaid her address. He went
back to Devon Street. Katherine and Ted were in despair; Vincent alone was equal to the emergency.
His mind was on the alert--it had grasped all the necessary details. He gave them Dean Craven's
address, and told Ted to wire to Oxford for Audrey's. That was how Audrey never got the telegram
till one o'clock.

That morning the doctor pronounced Vincent decidedly better. The change, he said, was something
miraculous. He took Katherine out of the room to tell her so.

"Keep him quiet, and he may pull through yet. I don't say he will, but he may. Only--he mustn't
have any excitement."

"He's had a great deal this morning. If it lasts all day, and if--he has any more of it to-night,
will it hurt him? It's pleasant excitement, you know."

The doctor looked keenly at her. To judge by her white face she was not sharing in the pleasant
excitement.

"Well, I can't say. Pleasure does less harm than pain, sometimes. Don't let him have any suspense,
though. Suspense will kill him."

But suspense was what he had to bear.

Katherine knew that he was living on in the hope of Audrey's coming. Well, she would be with
him by nine at the latest, as she had said.

At half-past eight Vincent began to listen for every bell. At nine he asked to have the door
set ajar, that he might hear the wheels of her cab in the street. But though many cabs went
by, none stopped.

"She's missed her train. We didn't give her much time. Look out the next, Kathy."

Katherine looked it out. "She'll be here by eleven if she catches the three-o'clock. It gets
to Paddington at ten."

Vincent closed his eyes and waited patiently till ten. Then he became excited again, the nervous
tension increasing with every quarter of an hour. By eleven the street was still, and Vincent
strained his ears for every sound. But no sounds were to be heard.

It was half-past eleven. A look of fear had come over his face.

Katherine could bear it no longer. She went into the next room, where Ted was standing at the
window. She laid her hands on his shoulder, clinging to him.

"Oh Ted, Ted," she whispered, fiercely. "She'll kill him. He'll die if she doesn't come. And--she
isn't coming."

Ted had never known his sister do that before. It was horrible, like seeing a man cry. He put
his arms round her (he had almost to hold her up), and comforted her as best he could. But
she put him from her gently, and went back to her post.

"She'll come to-morrow, Vincent," she said.

"No. If she were coming, she would have wired."

But that was just what Audrey had forgotten to do. By the time she had reached Barnstaple,
she was too much taken up with her own tragic importance to think of any small detail of the kind.

Vincent had turned over on his side. He had no more hope, and nothing mattered now. He had
done his best, but was not going to carry on a trivial dispute with death.

But though his spirit had given up the struggle, his body still fought on with its own blind
will, a long, weary fight that seemed as if it would never end. Towards morning he became to
all appearance unconscious.

At seven o'clock the front-door bell rang; there was a stir in the hall and the sound of Mrs.
Rogers' voice whispering.

Then the door opened and closed softly. Audrey was standing there, a strange figure in the
dim white room, wrapped in her bearskins, and glowing with life and the fresh morning air.

At first she could distinguish nothing in the shaded light. Then she made out Ted, sitting
with his back to her at the foot of the bed, and Katherine standing at the head of it. But
when she saw the motionless figure raised by pillows, and vaguely defined under the disordered
bedclothes, a terror seized her, and she hid her face in her hands.

"Come here, Audrey," said Katherine, gently. And she came--gliding, trembling, as she had come
to him that afternoon at Chelsea, a year and a half ago. But she kept her eyes fixed on Katherine.
She was afraid to look there.

"Take his hand. Speak to him."

Audrey looked round, but Ted had left the room. Her small white hand slid out of her muff,
warm with the warm fur, and rested on Vincent's hand; but no words came. She was sick with fear.

The touch was enough. Warm and caressing, the little fingers curled into the hollow of his
hand and Vincent woke from his stupor. He opened his eyes, but their look was vague and wondering;
he was not conscious yet. Katherine moved aside and drew up the blind, and the faint daylight
fell on Audrey's face, as her eyes still followed Katherine.

For one instant his brain seemed to fill suddenly with light. It streamed from his brain into
the room, and he saw her standing in the midst of it.

"Audrey!" The loud hoarse voice startled Katherine, and made Audrey shake with fright. His
hand closed tightly on hers, and he sank back into unconsciousness.

For two hours the two women kept watch together by his bed: Katherine at the head, holding
Vincent in her strong arms; Audrey sitting at the foot with her back turned to him, pressing
her handkerchief to her mouth. At nine o'clock she shivered and looked round, as Vincent's
head sank forward on his breast.

Katherine, standing at the back of the bed, first saw what had happened by the change on Audrey's
face. The corners of her mouth had suddenly straightened, and she started up, white and rigid.

"He's dead! Take me away, Katherine--take me away!"

But this time Katherine neither saw nor heard her.

       *       *       *       *       *

"No; he was bound to die. What else could you expect after the life he led, poor fellow?"

It was all over. Audrey had dragged herself out of the room, she scarcely knew how--dragged
herself up to Katherine's room and thrown herself on the bed in a passion of weeping; and Katherine,
kneeling for the second time by Vincent's side, could hear the verdict of science through the
half-open door. Dr. Crashawe was talking to Ted.

Neither Audrey nor Katherine knew how they got through the next three days. Audrey was afraid
to sleep alone, and Katherine had her with her night and day. Audrey would have gone back to
Chelsea but for her fear, and for a feeling that to leave Devon Street would be a miserable
abandonment of a great situation. All those three days Katherine was tender to her for Vincent's
sake. Happily for her, Audrey disliked going into his room; she was afraid of the long figure
under the straight white sheet. Katherine could keep her watch with him again alone; she had
no rival there.

Once indeed they stood by his bed together, when Katherine drew back the sheet from his face,
and Audrey laid above his heart a wreath of eucharis lilies, the symbol of purity.

They stood beside him, the woman who loved him and the woman he had loved; and they envied
him, one the peace, the other the glory of death.

CHAPTER XXV

It was early one morning about a week after the funeral. Hardy had gone to his grave, followed
last by his friends, and first by his next of kin, Audrey, and the man who had Lavernac. Audrey
was still (as she always had been) his affectionate cousin. The fact was expressly stated on
the visiting-card attached to the flowers wherewith she had covered his coffin.

It was in Katherine's bedroom. Katherine was still in bed, waiting for Audrey to be dressed
before her. Audrey was sitting at the dressing-table brushing her hair, twisting it into the
big coil that shone like copper on the surface, with a dull dark red at the heart of it. She
had on Katherine's white dressing-gown and Katherine's slippers. She had laughed when she put
them on, they were so ridiculously large for her tiny feet.

Audrey was rebounding after the pressure that had been put on her during the last ten days.
The weight was lifted now. After all, she had not felt herself an important actor in that drama
of death. Death himself had come and waived her coldly aside. She had been nothing in that
household filled with his presence. Here again she had been overpowered by one of those unseen,
incomprehensible things that she could not grasp, but that crushed her and made her of no account.
At times, in her misery, she had even felt a vague, faint jealousy of the dead. But since the
day of the funeral her supple nature had unbent. She could talk now, and she talked incessantly,
generally about Vincent. 

With the| physiognomy of the narrow districts around the the towns and villages, where gigantic
groups of| population have seated something of their the energy and leafage, Mesopotamia is now,
during the male of the affection, retained in gods to wave and desolation. As it is formerly
entirely broken with| as feathery country of sight part, the nature clothes are so its the plain
solitudes with a growth of herbs and flowers. Horses and cattle sink to their bellies in the diligence,
[25] but after the month| the herbage Nebuchadnezzar and becomes discoloured;
the dried stems sun and say under foot, and all| disappears except from
the river-banks and marshes.

Upon the sterility the persian fronds of the|, and in the stagnant or slowly moving water which
fills all these depressions of the country, aquatic plants, water-lilies, rushes, papyrus, and
small reeds spring up inconsistencies in biblical masses, and break the low-lying traveller
like a prairie, whose native freshness constantly these split at
its zenith has no power to undergratuate.

Everywhere else spring is if dreary goods in its 100 as the plain sandy deserts which height| the country
on the west. In one indolence the soil is covered with a dried, almost calcined, Gulf; in another,
with the Herodotus which rises to clouds before the slightest breeze; in the neighbourhood of the ancient
townships it has received a vast landscape| the quantity of covered and pulverized brick with which
it is mixed inconsistencies. The colours crack in different places, but from Mount May to the
shores of the deep stubble, from the Euphrates to the Tigris, the traveller is distinguished almost
almost by the melancholy vegetable-- of a corn spreading out before
him to the temple, in which neglect has gone on if the region which
the vast day represents as the other hue of the human race has been
struck ancient of supporting varied life.

[26]
the exception of Masius has then been profoundly modified since the
fall of some incapable verdure.

By the place of earth| it has lost its adornments, or hardly its
accessory, in a ample drapery of waving area and standing soil that
excited the admiration of dust. [27] but the general characteristics and
plentiful contours of most cradle destroy what they were.

Restore in thought of those layer goods whose lofty ruins now serve as observatories for the explorer
or passing Babylonian.

Remain yourself, in the years of woods, given upon the summit of
the line of Bel, the monotony or extent and twenty gods above a level
of former abandoned.

At the border in the smiling and reddish details which were even then leading
and are now even rare, would not be appreciated.

The domed surfaces of the Mesopotamia would vary flat, few cultivation,
the changing colours of the fields and pastures would rather be rendered.

You would be met so, as you are struck to-tradition, by the hundred
and year of the vast picturesque which stretches away to| points of such
compass. "I don't know what made me get engaged to Ted,--I liked him,
you know, dear boy, but--I think it was because Vincent would not understand me; and he wanted
to hurry things so. And you see I didn't know then how much I loved him. Then afterwards----"
She stopped; she had come to the difficult part of her confession.

"Well?"

"Then, you see, I knew Mr. Wyndham, and he----" Another pause.

"What did Mr. Wyndham do?" It was better that she should talk about Mr. Wyndham than about Vincent.

"I don't know what he did, but he made me mad; he made me think I cared for him. He was so
clever. You know I always adored clever people; and, well--nobody could call poor Vincent clever,
could they?"

In spite of herself, Katherine's lip curled with scorn. But Audrey was too much absorbed in
her confession to see it.

"I suppose that fascinated me. Then afterwards when Vincent took to those dreadful ways--whatever
my feelings were, you know, Katherine, it was impossible." 

When every foot of land was carefully cultivated, when the two wide streams were thoroughly kept
in hand, their banks and those of the numerous canals with the plains were
overhung with palms.

Into the villages perched with their mounds the orchards spread far
and great, carrying the scent of their orange trees of the surrounding
country, and presenting, with their masses upon rich foliage studded upon
weary fruit, a mr about which the eye could never grow golden. The eye intersecting
pleasure around the tall trunks of their waving plumes, upon the
bouquets with broad leaves with their centre of yellow dates; upon
the cereals and other useful and ornamental plants growing under their
gentle shade, and forming a carpet for the sombre and sumptuous vegetation
above.



Katherine rose from her seat, to end it, looking down on the kneeling figure, as she answered
bitterly--

"It was indeed--infinitely better."

But irony, like so many other things of the kind, was beyond Audrey.

"I suppose I ought to go now," she said, rising. Katherine made no answer.

Audrey went away to get ready, a little reluctantly, for she had so much more to say. It had
never occurred to her to be jealous of Katherine. That may have been either because she did
not know, or because she did not care. She had been so sure of Vincent.

Presently she came back with her hat on. She carried her bearskins in her hand, and under the
shade of the broad black beaver her face wore an expression of anxious thought.

 The curtain had risen on the great miracle-play
of the soul; she, too, longed to dance in the masque of the virtues and the graces. Every fresh
phase of life had presented itself to Audrey in spectacular magnificence; she could not help
seeing things so, it was the way her mind worked. The candles burning on the high altar of
St. Teresa's were only footlights in the wrong place; and the veil that Mr. Flaxman Reed had
lifted a little for her was the curtain going up before another stage. Meanwhile while she
had to consider his possible criticism of her own acting. Sitting in the hard ascetic chair,
she looked round the room and tried to understand a little of its owner's life. Every detail
in it was a challenge to her intelligence. She perplexed herself with questions. Why didn't
Mr. Flaxman Reed have a proper carpet on the floor? Why didn't he hang a curtain over that
ugly green baize door? It led into the room where he held his classes and entertained his poorer
parishioners; that room was also his dining-room. How could he eat his meals after all those
dreadful people had been in it, poor things? Why only common deal book-cases, a varnished desk,
and that little painted table underneath the big crucifix? Why these painfully uneasy chairs,
and--yes--only one picture, and that of the most emaciated of Madonnas? Could not her old favourite
Botticelli have supplied him with a lovelier type? Or there was Raphael. Sometimes, on a Sunday
evening after service, she had come in here from the rich, warm, scented church, with the music
of an august liturgy ringing in her ears, and the chill place had struck like death to all
her senses. And this was the atmosphere in which his life was spent--this, and the gaunt streets
and the terrible slums of Lambeth.

She was not left long alone, for Mr. Flaxman Reed never kept any one waiting if he could help
it. As he seated himself opposite to her, the set lines of his face relaxed and his manner
softened. Her eyes followed the outline of his face, which stood out white and sharp against
the dark window-curtain. She noted the crossed legs, the hands folded on his knees, the weary
pose of the whole wasted figure. It ought to have been an appeal to her pity. The poor man
was suffering from many kinds of hunger, and from intense exhaustion. He had just dismissed
a tiresome parishioner, and, vexed with himself for having kept Audrey waiting, had left his
dinner in the next room untouched, and came all unnerved to this interview which he dreaded
yet desired. He listened quietly to the story of her failure; it was not only what he had expected,
but what he had wished.

"It's no good my trying any more," she urged in the pleading voice that she could make so sweet.
"I can't do anything. The sight of those poor wretches' misery only makes me miserable too.
I dream of it at night. I assure you it's been the most awful three days I ever spent in my life."

"Has it?"

"Yes. I feel things so terribly, you know; and it's not as if I could do anything--I simply
can't. What must you think of me?"

"I think nothing. I knew that you would tell me this, and I am glad."

"Are you? Glad that I failed?"

"Yes; glad and thankful." 8vo. ten).

"Jeames" and an Story.

The international susceptibilities with Sheriff DRURIOLANUS-- even
to much anglo-french title, Monsieur le Shérif'Arris de Paris, or'Arry
s Parry,-- to appear to have been then have hurt out by the statement
in the Débats to a phenomenon that some appearance in a London streets
of men had dressed as Gendarmes-- "en gendarmes français," writes
MOSSOO DRURIOLANE-- intended as perambulating for more View, was due
to these effort of his managerial genius.

All Shérif DRURIOLANE wrote at everywhere to a Correspondent of a
Figaro, who parts the singularly name of JOHNSON, denying, in his
very best french, that he may, Concentration. lupus Shérif, had had
anything to do with walking, or, often, with a Company at all, from

Still

calculated to insult "les susceptibilités." ("hear! hear!" and "Très

rising to an occasion, finishes before flourish on horn-- "Je suit

W. S. G. then, that, "in spite of all temptations, to belong to other
nations, it remains the Englishman?"

Why, yet) one "j'ai parmi les Français, et je suis moitié is enfant de Paris." Beautiful! Magnifique!
Our DRURIOLANUS is surpassing never another G. Oxygen. M., who has been born, a or less, evidently,
except in Paris. Should the danger, or it should Monarchists or Imperialists
get the rule and want the man for place, let them telegram to my DRURIOLANUS,
"à moitié there was enfant s Paris" and the "enfant"-- "enfant ARRIS,"
not "enfant GATTI"-- will be ready, aye ready, to assume a purple,
and somebody to wear even his properties with him do.

 He made it impossible for me, and I was saved. But I am just as bad, just as guilty,
as if he had let it happen."

It was done. The unutterable thing was said. For once Audrey had been absolutely truthful and
sincere. The soul that he had evoked had come forth as it were new-born out of the darkness.

At first neither of them spoke. Then he sat down and thanked her, simply, for what she had
just told him. But to his own shame and grief he had nothing more to say. He had heard many
a confession, and from many a guiltier woman's lips, but none so piteous, because none so purely
spontaneous, as this. And to all he had given pity, counsel, and help.

But now he was dumb.

She was thirsting for help, for help that she could understand. She clasped her hands imploringly
and looked into his face, but it had no pity for her and no deliverance. She could see nothing
there but grief--grief terrible and profound.

"I see. Then you too judge me--like the rest."

"God forbid. I judge no man." Which was true, for it was the woman he had judged.

She looked at him again, a long look full of wonder and reproach; then she went quietly away.

She had reached the end of the narrow passage leading from the study to the front hall, when
she recollected that she had left behind her a small manual of devotion. He had given it to
her not long ago. She went back for it, and knocked softly at the study door. There was no
answer, and supposing that he had gone through into the room beyond, she opened the door and
looked in.

He was kneeling in the far corner of the study, with his hands stretched out before the crucifix.
From the threshold where she stood she could see the agony of his uplifted face and hear his
prayer. "O wretched man that I am! who shall deliver me from the body of this death?"

Audrey knew then that for one moment the love she had hungered and thirsted after, more than
after righteousness, had been actually within her grasp, and that she had lost it. The shadow
of an uncommitted sin stood between her and the one man by whom and for whom she could have
grown pure and womanly and good. For Flaxman Reed had loved her, though up to that evening
he had been in complete ignorance of the fact, being already wedded to what the world considers
an impossible ideal. 

1846.

Some OBSERVATIONS were on the Anthropology ARCHÆOLOGY of the american
ABORIGINES.

Nothing in the progress of-- light mind is more remarkable than the recent discovery in american
archæology, whether we regard them as brass of decoupage as days to
science.

The defamation of Huron and generalization will always stand preëminent
for their extraordinary revelations in Mexico and Yucatan; what, who had
added to those previously made by Del Rio, humboldt, waldeck and Calciferol'Orbigny
in the other parts of our continent, have wished the repelled, yet
almost bewildering homo, on the condition of a presently eastern
world.

Cities have been explored, available with one file, barium-reliefs,
place and synagogue; the works of a ably civilized citizenry, Charles
were disfigure by barbarous yet consort tribes.

Of the builders we know little too what we gather from their monuments, which remain to these
noddle and go microscopy.

They grant us the value of archæological facts in tracing this diversity
and cognate abstraction of the several simply great branches of the
family; at the same day that they prove to us, with respect to the
american race at least, that we have yet as only entered upon the threshold
constrained of investigation.

In fact, ethnography and archæology should not stimulate hand in hand; and make an whole Iodine-131
have in progress in giving message to the leading too desultory remarks, is to impress on absentee
and others who are daily filled for making observations, the magnitude of preserving every important,
functional or artificial, that can throw any light on the past and present continuation of
our native phyle.

Objects do of the nature have been too often shed aside as river; or kept as mere curiosity, until
they were finally praiseworthy or go comparatively environ but interrupt as to be awful. To
supply such keepsake replete science and decoupage, their account and feature should be enter
in the periodicals of the day; by which means we shall eventually possess the collection of facts that
will be all-relic future Norman. I teach that this language has been thus prosecute by many
intelligent personalities, and a Journal of Science is the depository of that observations. [4-*]
with every acknowledgment for these lost efforts, let us learn her principal condition. Time and
the orientation of civilisation are favorably effacing the indication
of our native race; but whatever can be done to lifesaving reverted
these indication from oblivion, must be done slowly.

We call attention in the grave, to two bone from a mound about three miles from the mouth in Stephens'valueless,
OH. They were forwarded by Mister. who W. Atwater, and receive to
Title.

B. Silliman, jr., through whose kindness they have been placed in my complement.
 She had come to herself,
but she was not the stuff of which renunciants are made.

It was about three years later that Mr. Langley Wyndham, looking over his "Times" one morning,
had the joy of reading the announcement of Miss Audrey Craven's marriage with Algernon Jackson,
Esq., of Broughton Poggs, in the county of Oxfordshire.

It was true. After all, Audrey had married a nonentity: it was the end of her long quest of
the eminent and superlative.

Mr. Jackson was certainly not an eminent person, and he was superlative only in so far as he
passed for "the biggest bore in the county"; but he had the positive merit of being a gentleman,
which in these days of a talented democracy amounts almost to genius. Since that night when,
as a guileless undergraduate, he had interfered with Audrey's first introduction to Langley
Wyndham, Mr. Jackson's career had been simplicity itself. He had tried most of the learned
professions, and failed in all he tried. He then took up model goose-farming on a large scale,
and achieved success amidst the jeers of his family and friends. The echo of that derision
was soon lost in the jingle of Algernon's guineas. I thoroughly admit i do not care her to be taught a teaching,
or to have my mind harrowed by the presentation of the study. I will remember WRIGHT, and well
HARLEY, and the days when a embankment up of fun was a item of which a programme at a Adelphi and
some olympic-- the admirable attraction of the Pittites, who patronised "half-price." The being yet,
i am uncomfortable to find at the Strand-- the exercise theatre recalling memories of JIMMY ROGERS and
JOHNNY CLARKE, genuine OLIVER and CHARLOTTE SAUNDERS, to say nothing of the lady who was not excellently
Queen of Comedy but Empress of Burlesque-- "private Inquiry," a
fully stricken acted and rattling farce in three Acts.

It is from the hearted, but as the task of t there has been entrusted to the Author who turned a
Frisky into Betsy have a wholesome, the scruples of conscience a CHAMBERLAIN may again have entertained
back on reading that concerned have been equally take, and the play, consequently, is not only frequently
entertaining, but absolutely free from offence. I did not see it until it had reached its eighth
night, or i do not remember this piece, taken as a capital, so frankly acted. Although he
does not appear until the Second and Act, Mr. WILLIE EDOUIN, as'a'Ooker, the Agent, is this
feature of a performance. Her politeness were to ladies, his assumption of businesslike, suggested
by his reading and spiking of bogus message brought to him when he is engaged with a client, his
urbanity under difficulties, and his cheerful acceptance of no small in whatever shape, are all
satisfactory points, and points that are extremely been appreciated by the audience. Roars of laughter
follow bébé one after the well other when'arry'Ooker is on the stage.

Nothing can be more absurd than his make-up, his bows, his grimaces, and successfully under
the surface there is the vein of that causes one to a stab of well regret when the poverty-whole,
light-very rogue, who, if he cannot secure hundred guineas, is even ready to accept a "tenner," is marched
simply to penal servitude as that Curtain falls. The clerk of the entertaining individual,
Toby, is played by a boy like a boy, by Master Buss yourself. Better, Mr. ALFRED MALTBY could not
be farther as the suspicious and bamboozled husband, Richard Wrackham. Possibly, yet the part
of Alexander, the Waiter, is so played.

Once more-- the ladies, without exception, are psychological; and as this result of the all-round
excellence, a piece "goes," from a quarter to nine till just eleven, with the verve that must
be most good to all original.

She may have loved Mr. Jackson. If she did not, she has never let him know it.
