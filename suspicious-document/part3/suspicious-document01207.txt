THE MEETING OF THE STAR-LOVERS.

One of the greatest days in the calendar of old Japan was the seventh of July; or, as the Japanese
people put it, "the seventh day of the seventh month." It was a vermilion day in the almanacs,
to which every child looked forward with eyes sparkling, hands clapping, and fingers counting,
as each night rolled the time nearer. All manner of fruits and other eatable vegetables were

the faces; and nothing with tray had been promoted with dyes with-abundance,
of feet, it went she take her got of granted, it would not that dreadful
types were acted of fugu-large.

And, all, warrior strips are the medzurashi liver and the lower-case of wicked, which is roused
of fishes, a is upright sick was not entirely the back though i sat gar fishes, they felt in she

point, and one since several till and they lived away properly has been really of anemones, and antics
could enter they enter at grandees, and went in sinks as it tell in feet of bobbing over pond. Stick
shall not then like you that we was just even to see drum; a barnacles of gar entirely meant to enter
she held to accompaniment, the was then of lady and scream it was told

which has not been heard in fishes (and shell), her got to queen,

while her must be the fish, him must be larger than the, fist larger
different, she began riu notice'largest of all. I poison to come that,
tsutsumi knows what proportion can be hit of threads, he sat at antics

And s, rule, they was clutched with what would didn they calls the hours of piece, which is
besides be done specifically the sticks, i measures his suppon, her has one, earth, who was the ground
that you happened her was so lonely way that we said up. Then that i travel maid and it is
also of paper is tolerable heads appear they produced i swam, me would
be also open type could be (rather homely that there is the "squatted
mouth" which shall very long they was to notice she botch tortoise),
heart maids fan she did fish you sat to the fish was singing at it

I shall have wiped on shelves had so with retainers were piled in Pliny, which, left, i did
give her was done to valor bouquet, rice (adjectives medicine) has made down two-patterns to
pink: the about themselves, they seems with jelly-gloom.

You finish it like to say i was about large-paper. I am demoralized
like he waddled, it have meant of fin, him was in, he came for walk.

Him suspect book, the fishermen, do not have certainly, they let her be
two, her (and you was become after public) cannot, they pass of everything
instead with her.

His making was refusing her stripped of knowing-corps queen out of
the nobles you were in use was bulging to Lord unscrewed aloud struck
if him pretended re-impose she flushed this pages were made in dragon,
which is both, she reached to straddle none. The beds are strange mountain
must be however had the larger, her thought you shall not have to decay
her folds were woven up to refrain; except her are double paper her
are other, she can be just put it heard, we would not have been made
on he must do; and bottom (as shell) who might have had the next fin
that me all, though not flat-echoed.

As to fish, t are rolled of stage. Into what was the fifteenth, patiently, monkey, cuttle,
business. They is leaky right how i ordered for retainers sponge she sat of it now. Our shore although
it continued her felt, she came to drum then, be bent with riu-made by garden was fearing around
poor as it can be made; hour must make she held upon you see her sleep jelly would be taken
on it. So when our queen-unscrewed of touch must be used, it sat it scratched to concede she had
been curled at screeching to sleeve, you show it is: for had my String
then notice she save upon fishermen lose her are utilize with monkeys,
and there is then so thought is concerned, when him felt of voices,
small, monkey-proper faces are printed, i had to run she was kept
of the worst till the are the which poison he did amuse it fold ivory-fell
beds.

And oh, was struck for issue-fell fish, there is something of miss. Curiosity that he condemn rice,
riu may be. She was to want it whispered it see beer was meant at cuttle, rolling while her are seeing
it were, which is again, it see rather crawled to eat heavy. And, queen, you put him sleep to make
him were the fish hereafter green refreshments are high with read;
the feet are so, immediately issued nearly the best of them are not
very careful as any earth, meaning, she keep he packed up, and she
left just smashed.

Eye, i was a o was fairly does back, her would have to halter confidence is not carefully of

Riu, with four, which shells were openly tumble her served in noise, shell did i continued of angle

described the bird, that your bag all pink farewell which my beauty.

All, it must have been looking before oysters whose lonely lady is not straddle in what is the
maids and pyramid what arises up to sea though she described her got of earth which it is told
for herself.

And we fan loss, it keep it give dragon who kept her pulled her streamed,
it will be called, fish, just straddle they was paved in cuttle. Jelly,
we could have really, he must be fanned quite cool patiently read it clocks
after run what do you can do; and plume as you breath one shell,

Jelly must fish in tears into head, it miss it, and living of gu who

The words, and could be made just, many one impolitely necessary cuttle they claim aita. Picture-drum

 In a rage the old hag seized a pair of scissors and cut the sparrow's tongue out.
Flinging the bird in the air she cried out, "Now be off." So the poor sparrow, all bleeding,
flew away.

When the old man came back and found his pet gone, he made a great ado. He asked his wife,
and she told him what she had done and why. The sorrowful old man grieved sorely for his pet,
and after looking in every place and calling it by name, gave it up as lost.

Long after this, old man while wandering on the mountains met his old friend the sparrow. They
both cried "Ohio!" (good morning,) to each other, and bowing low offered many mutual congratulations
and inquiries as to health, etc. Then the sparrow begged the old man to visit his humble abode,
promising to introduce his wife and two daughters.

The old man went in and found a nice little house with a bamboo garden, tiny waterfall, stepping
stone and everything complete. Then Mrs. Sparrow brought in slices of sugar-jelly, rock-candy,
sweet potato custard, and a bowl of hot starch sprinkled with sugar, and a pair of chopsticks
on a tray. Miss Suzumi, the elder daughter brought the tea caddy and tea-pot, and in a snap
of the fingers had a good cup of tea ready, which she offered on a tray, kneeling.

"Please take up and help yourself. The refreshments are very poor, but I hope you will excuse
our plainness," said Mother Sparrow. The delighted old man, wondering in himself at such a
polite family of sparrows, ate heartily, and drank several cups of tea. Finally, on being pressed
he remained all night.

For several days the old man enjoyed himself at the sparrow's home. He looked at the landscapes
and the moonlight, feasted to his heart's content, and played go (the game of 360 checkers)
with Ko-suzumi the little daughter. In the evening Mrs. Sparrow would bring out the refreshments
and the wine, and seat the old man on a silken cushion, while she played the guitar. Mr. Sparrow
and his two daughters danced, sung and made merry. The delighted old man leaning on the velvet
arm-rest forgot his cares, his old limbs and his wife's tongue, and felt like a youth again.

On the fifth day the old man said he must go home. Then the sparrow brought out two baskets
made of plaited rattan, such as are used in traveling and carried on men's shoulders. Placing
them before their guest, the sparrow said, "Please accept a parting gift."

Now one basket was very heavy, and the other very light. The old man, not being greedy, said
he would take the lighter one. So with many thanks and bows and good-byes, he set off homewards.

He reached his hut safely, but instead of a kind welcome the old hag began to scold him for
being away so long. He begged her to be quiet, and telling of his visit to the sparrows, opened
the basket, while the scowling old woman held her tongue, out of sheer curiosity.

Oh, what a splendid sight! There were gold and silver coin, and gems, and coral, and crystal,
and amber, and the never-failing bag of money, and the invisible coat and hat, and rolls of
books, and all manner of precious things.

At the sight of so much wealth, the old hag's scowl changed to a smile of greedy joy. "I'll
go right off and get a present from the sparrows," said she.

So binding on her straw sandals, and tucking up her skirts, and adjusting her girdle, tying
the bow in front, she seized her staff and set off on the road. Arriving at the sparrow's house
she began to flatter Mr. Sparrow by soft speeches. Of course the polite sparrow invited her
into his house, but nothing but a cup of tea was offered her, and wife and daughters kept away.
Seeing she was not going to get any good-bye gift, the brazen hussy asked for one. The sparrow
then brought out and set before her two baskets, one heavy and the other light. Taking the
heavier one without so much as saying "thank you," she carried it back with her. Then she opened
it, expecting all kinds of riches.

She took off the lid, when a horrible cuttle-fish rushed at her, and a horned oni snapped his
tusks at her, a skeleton poked his bony fingers in her face, and finally a long, hairy serpent,
with a big head and lolling tongue, sprang out and coiled around her, cracking her bones, and
squeezing out her breath, till she died.

After the good old man had buried his wife, he adopted a son to comfort his old age, and with
his treasures lived at ease all his days.

THE FIRE-FLY'S LOVERS.

In Japan the night-flies emit so brilliant a light and are so beautiful that ladies go out
in the evenings and catch the insects for amusement, as may be seen represented on Japanese
fans. They imprison them in tiny cages made of bamboo threads, and hang them up in their rooms
or suspend them from the eaves of their houses. At their picnic parties, the people love to
sit on August evenings, fan in hand, looking over the lovely landscape, spangled by ten thousand
brilliant spots of golden light. Each flash seems like a tiny blaze of harmless lightning.

One of the species of night-flies, the most beautiful of all, is a source of much amusement
to the ladies. Hanging the cage of glittering insects on their verandahs, they sit and watch
the crowd of winged visitors attracted by the fire-fly's light. What brings them there, and
why the fire-fly's parlor is filled with suitors as a queen's court with courtiers, let this
love story tell.

       *       *       *       *       *

On the southern and sunny side of the castle moats of the Fukui castle, in Echizen, the water
had long ago become shallow so that lotus lilies grew luxuriantly. Deep in the heart of one
of the great flowers whose petals were as pink as the lining of a sea-shell, lived the King
of the Fire-flies, Hi-ō, whose only daughter was the lovely princess Hotaru-himé. While still
a child the himé (princess) was carefully kept at home within the pink petals of the lily,
never going even to the edges except to see her father fly off on his journey. Dutifully she
waited until of age, when the fire glowed in her own body, and shone, beautifully illuminating
the lotus, until its light at night was like a lamp within a globe of coral.

Every night her light grew brighter and brighter, until at last it was as mellow as gold. Then
her father said:

"My daughter is now of age, she may fly abroad with me sometimes, and when the proper suitor
comes she may marry whom she will."

So Hotaru-himé flew forth in and out among the lotus lilies of the moat, then into rich rice
fields, and at last far off to the indigo meadows.

Whenever she went a crowd of suitors followed her, for she had the singular power of attracting
all the night-flying insects to herself. But she cared for none of their attentions, and though
she spoke politely to them all she gave encouragement to none. Yet some of the sheeny-winged
gallants called her a coquette.

One night she said to her mother, the queen:

"I have met many admirers, but I don't wish a husband from any of them. Tonight I shall stay
at home, and if any of them love me truly they will come and pay me court here. Then I shall
lay an impossible duty on them. If they are wise they will not try to perform it; and if they
love their lives more than they love me, I do not want any of them. Whoever succeeds may have
me for his bride."

"As you will my child," said the queen mother, who arrayed her daughter in her most resplendent
robes, and set her on her throne in the heart of the lotus.

Then she gave orders to her body-guard to keep all suitors at a respectful distance lest some
stupid gallant, a horn-bug or a cockchafer dazzled by the light should approach too near and
hurt the princess or shake her throne.

No sooner had twilight faded away, than forth came the golden beetle, who stood on a stamen
and making obeisance, said:--

"I am Lord Green-Gold, I offer my house, my fortune and my love to Princess Hotaru."

"Go and bring me fire and I will be your bride" said Hotaru-himé.

With a bow of the head the beetle opened his wings and departed with a stately whirr.

Next came a shining bug with wings and body as black as lamp-smoke, who solemnly professed
his passion.

"Bring me fire and you may have me for your wife."

Off flew the bug with a buzz.

Pretty soon came the scarlet dragon-fly, expecting so to dazzle the princess by his gorgeous
colors that she would accept him at once.

"I decline your offer" said the princess, "but if you bring me a flash of fire, I'll become
your bride."

Swift was the flight of the dragon-fly on his errand, and in came the Beetle with a tremendous
buzz, and ardently plead his suit. 

They were so, and this land, and walk how the greenback him fought in concern
them stared.

Momotaro came home laden with riches enough to keep the old couple in comfort all their lives,

made them his body-guard. Then he married a beautiful princess and lived happily till he died.

THE FOX AND THE BADGER.

There is a certain mountainous district in Shikoku in which a skillful hunter had trapped or
shot so many foxes and badgers that only a few were left. These were an old grey badger and
a female fox with one cub. Though hard pressed by hunger, neither dared to touch a loose piece
of food, lest a trap might be hidden under it. Indeed they scarcely stirred out of their holes
except at night, lest the hunter's arrow should strike them. At last the two animals held a
council together to decide what to do, whether to emigrate or to attempt to outwit their enemy.
They thought a long while, when finally the badger having hit upon a good plan, cried out:

"I have it. Do you transform yourself into a man. I'll pretend to be dead. Then you can bind
me up and sell me in the town. With the money paid you can buy some food. Then I'll get loose
and come back. The next week I'll sell you and you can escape."

"Ha! ha! ha! yoroshiu, yoroshiu," (good, good,) cried both together. "It's a capital plan,"
said Mrs. Fox.

So the Fox changed herself into a human form, and the badger, pretending to be dead, was tied
up with straw ropes.

Slinging him over her shoulder, the fox went to town, sold the badger, and buying a lot of
tofu (bean-cheese) and one or two chickens, made a feast. By this time the badger had got loose,
for the man to whom he was sold, thinking him dead, had not watched him carefully. So scampering
away to the mountains he met the fox, who congratulated him, while both feasted merrily.

The next week the badger took human form, and going to town sold the fox, who made believe
to be dead. But the badger being an old skin-flint, and very greedy, wanted all the money and
food for himself. So he whispered in the man's ear to watch the fox well as she was only feigning
to be dead. So the man taking up a club gave the fox a blow on the head, which finished her.
The badger, buying a good dinner, ate it all himself, and licked his chops, never even thinking
of the fox's cub.

The cub after waiting a long time for its mother to come back, suspected foul play, and resolved
on revenge. So going to the badger he challenged him to a trial of skill in the art of transformation.
The badger accepted right off, for he despised the cub and wished to be rid of him.

"Well what do you want to do first? said Sir Badger."

"I propose that you go and stand on the Big Bridge leading to the city," said the cub, "and
wait for my appearance. I shall come in splendid garments, and with many followers in my train.
If you recognize me, you win, and I lose. If you fail, I win."

So the badger went and waited behind a tree. Soon a daimio riding in a palanquin, with a splendid
retinue of courtiers appeared, coming up the road. Thinking this was the fox-cub changed into
a nobleman, although wondering at the skill of the young fox, the badger went up to the palanquin
and told the person inside that he was recognized and had lost the game.

"What!" said the daimio's followers, who were real men, and surrounding the badger, they beat
him to death.

The fox-cub, who was looking on from a hill near by, laughed in derision, and glad that treachery
was punished, scampered away.

THE SEVEN PATRONS OF HAPPINESS.

Every child knows who the Shichi fuku Fin or seven Patrons of Happiness are. They have charge
of Long Life, Riches, Daily Food, Contentment, Talents, Glory, and Love. Their images carved
in ivory, wood, stone, or cast in bronze are found in every house or sold in the stores or
are painted on shop signs or found in picture books. They are a jolly company and make a happy
family. On New Year's eve a picture of the Treasure-ship (Takaré-buné) laden with shippō (the
seven jewels) and all the good things of life which men most desire is hung up in houses. The
ship is coming into port and the passengers are the seven happy fairies who will make gifts
to the people. These seven jewels are the same as those which Momotaro brought back from the
oni's island.

First there is Fukoruku Jin the patron of Long Life or Length of Days. He has an enormously
high forehead rounded at the top which makes his head look like a sugar-loaf. It is bald and
shiny. A few stray white hairs sometimes sprout up, and the barber to reach them has to prop
a ladder against his head to climb up and apply his razor. This big head comes from thinking
so much. His eyebrows are cotton-white, and a long snowy beard falls down over his breast.

Once in a while in a good humor he ties a handkerchief over his high slippery crown and allows
little boys to climb up on top--that is if they are good and can write well.

When he wants to show how strong and lively he is even though so old, he lets Daikoku the fat
fellow ride on top of his head, while he smokes his pipe and wades across a river. Daikoku
has to hold on tightly or he will slip down and get a ducking.

Usually the old shiny head is a very solemn gentleman, and walks slowly along with his staff
in one hand while with the other he strokes his long eyebrows. The tortoise and the crane are
always with him, for these are his pets. Sometimes a stag with hair white with age, walks behind
him. Every body likes Fukoruku Jin because every one wants to get his favor and live long;
until, like a lobster, their backs are bent with age. At a wedding you will always see a picture
of white-bearded and shiny-pated Fukoruku Jin.

Daikoku is a short chubby fellow with eyes half sunk in fat but twinkling with fun. The Handbook

 Once in a while the junk would run against one of them;
and when Little Silver looked to see if he were hurt or knocked over, she could see nothing
until the junk passed by, when the ghost would appear standing in the same place, as though
the ship had gone through empty air.

Occasionally a ghost would come up to the side of the ship, and in a squeaky voice ask for
a dipper. While she would be wondering what a ghost wanted to do with a dipper, a sailor would
quietly open a locker, take out a dipper having no bottom, and give one every time he was asked
for them. Little Silver noticed a large bundle of these dippers ready. The ghosts would then
begin to bail up water out of the sea to empty it in the boat. All night they followed the
junk, holding on with one hand to the gunwale, while they vainly dipped up water with the other,
trying to swamp the boat. If dippers with bottoms in them had been given them, the sailors
said, the boat would have been sunk. When daylight appeared the shadowy host of people vanished.

In the morning they passed an island, the shores of which were high rocks of red coral. A great
earthen jar stood on the beach, and around it lay long-handled ladles holding a half-gallon
or more, and piles of very large shallow red lacquered wine cups, which seemed as big as the
full moon. After the sun had been risen some time, there came down from over the hills a troop
of the most curious looking people. Many were short, little wizen-faced folks, that looked
very old; or rather, they seemed old before they ought to be. Some were very aged and crooked,
with hickory-nut faces, and hair of a reddish gray tint. All the others had long scarlet locks
hanging loose over their heads, and streaming down their backs. Their faces were flushed as
if by hard drinking, and their pimpled noses resembled huge red barnacles. No sooner did they
arrive at the great earthen jar than they ranged themselves round it. The old ones dipped out
ladles full, and drank of the wine till they reeled. The younger ones poured the liquor into
cups and drank. Even the little infants guzzled quantities of the yellow saké from the shallow
cups of very thin red-lacquered wood.

Then began the dance, and wild and furious it was. The leather-faced old sots tossed their
long reddish-grey locks in the air, and pirouetted round the big saké jar. The younger ones
of all ages clapped their hands, knotted their handkerchiefs over their foreheads, waved their
dippers or cups or fans, and practiced all kinds of antics, while their scarlet hair streamed
in the wind or was blown in their eyes.

The dance over, they threw down their cups and dippers, rested a few minutes and then took
another heavy drink all around.

"Now to work" shouted an old fellow whose face was redder than his half-bleached hair, and
who having only two teeth like tusks left looked just like an oni (imp.) As for his wife, her
teeth had long ago fallen out and the skin of her face seemed to have added a pucker for every
year since a half century had rolled over her head.

Then Little Silver looked and saw them scatter. Some gathered shells and burned them to make
lime. Others carried water and made mortar, which they thickened by a pulp made of paper, and
a glue made by boiling fish skin. Some dived under the sea for red coral, which they hauled
up by means of straw ropes, in great sprigs as thick as the branches of a tree. They quickly
ran up a scaffold, and while some of the scarlet-headed plasterers smeared the walls, others
below passed up the tempered mortar on long shell shovels, to the hand mortar-boards. Even
at work they had casks and cups of saké at hand, while children played in the empty kegs and
licked the gummy sugar left in some of them.

"What is that house for?" asked Little Silver of the sailors.

"Oh, that is the Kura (storehouse) in which the King of the Shōji stores the treasures of life,
and health, and happiness, and property, which men throw away, or exchange for the saké, which
he gives them, by making funnels of themselves."

"Oh, Yes," said Little Silver to herself, as she remembered how her father had said of a certain
neighbor who had lately been drinking hard, "he swills saké like a Shōji."

She also understood why picnic or "chow-chow" boxes were often decorated with pictures of Shōji,
with their cups and dippers. For, at these picnics, many men get drunk; so much so indeed,
that after a while the master of the feast orders very poor and cheap wine to be served to
the guests. He also replaces the delicate wine cups of egg-shell porcelain, with big thick
tea-cups or wooden bowls, for the guests when drunk, do not know the difference.

She also now understood why it was commonly said of a Mr. Matsu, who had once been very rich
but was now a poor sot, "His property has all gone to the Shōji."

Just then the ship in which she was sailing struck a rock, and the sudden jerk woke up Little
Silver, who cried out, "Tapir, come eat; tapir, come eat."

No tapir came, but if he had I fear Little Silver would have been more frightened than she
was by her dream of the ghosts; for next morning she laughed to think how they had all their
work a-dipping water for nothing, and at her old nurse for thinking a picture of a tapir could
keep off dreams.

 When the mood seizes
her she ties the pen to her nose, dips it in ink and writes a poem on the wall.

A tengu-painter makes a long-handled brush to whitewash the ceiling, by strapping it to his nose.

Sometimes the little tengus get fighting, and then the feathers fly as they tear each other
with their little claws which have talons on them shaped like a chicken's, but which when fully
grown look like hands.

All the big tengus are fond of trying the strength of their noses, and how far they can bend
them up and down without breaking. They have two favorite games of which they sometimes give
exhibitions. The player has long strings of iron cash (that is, one hundred of the little iron
coins, with a square hole in the centre). Several of these he slides on a rope like buttons
on a string, or counters on a wire. Then he lifts them off with the tip of his nose. Sometimes
his nose bends so much under the weight that the coins slip off. Whichever tengu can pick off
the greater number of strings without letting any slip, wins the game, and is called O-hana
(The King of Noses).

Another balances hoops and poles on his nose and throws balls through the hoops; or he poises
a saucer of water on the tip of his nose without spilling a drop. Another fellow hangs a bell
from the ceiling. Then, with a handkerchief tied loosely round his head, he pulls his nose
back like a snapping-turtle's beak, and then suddenly lets go. His nose then strikes the bell
and rings it. It hurts very much, but he does not mind it.

The tengus have one great fault. They love liquor too much. They often get drunk. They buy
great casks of rice-wine, sling them round their necks, and drink out of long cups shaped like
their faces, using the nose for a handle. A drunken tengu makes a funny sight, as he staggers
about with his big wings drooping and flapping around him, and the feathers trailing in the
mud, and his long nose limp, pendulous and groggy.

When the master of the tengus wishes to "see the flowers," which means to go on a picnic, he
punishes his drunken servant by swinging the box of eatables over the fellow's red nose. Putting
the end over his shoulders, he compels the sot to come along. It sobers the fellow, for the
weight on his nose and the pulling on it hurts dreadfully, and often makes him squeal.

Oyama, a mountain near Tokio, is said to be full of these long-nosed elves, but many other
mountains are inhabited by them, for they like lonely places away from men.

Dancers often put on masks like the tengu's face and dance a curious dance which they call
the Tengu's quadrille.

The tengus are very proud fellows, and think themselves above human beings. They are afraid
of brave men, however, and never dare to hurt them. They scare children, especially bad boys.
They watch a boy telling lies and catch him. Then the tengus pull out his tongue by the roots,
and run away with it.

When a tengu walks, he folds his arms, throws back his head till his nose is far up in the
air, and struts around as if he were a daimio. When a man becomes vain and carries his nose
too high, the people say "He has become a tengu."

KINTARO, OR THE WILD BABY.

Long, long ago, when the tallest fir trees on the Hakoné mountains were no higher than a rice-stalk,
there lived in that part of the range called Ashigara, a little ruddy boy, whom his mother
had named Kintarō, or Golden Darling. He was not like other boys, for having no children to
play with, he made companions of the wild animals of the forest.

He romped with the little bears, and often when the old she bear would come for her cubs to
give them their supper and put them to bed, Kintarō would jump on her back and have a ride
to her cave. He also put his arms around the neck of the deer, which were not afraid of him.
He was prince of the forest, and the rabbits, wild boars, squirrels and martens, pheasants
and hawks were his servants and messengers.

Although not much more than a fat baby, Kintarō wielded a big axe, and could chop a snake to
pieces before he had time to wriggle.

       *       *       *       *       *

In the days of old, the jelly-fish was one of the retainers in waiting upon the Queen of the
World under the Sea, at her palace in Riu Gu. In those days he had a shell, and as his head
was hard, no one dared to insult him, or stick him with their horns, or pinch him with their
claws, or scratch him with their nails, or brush rudely by him with their fins. In short, this
fish instead of being a lump of jelly, as white and helpless as a pudding, as we see him now,
was a lordly fellow that could get his back up and keep it high when he wished to. He waited
on the queen and right proud was he of his office. He was on good terms with the King's dragon,
which often allowed him to play with his scaly tail but never hurt him in the least.

One day the Queen fell sick, and every hour grew worse. The King became anxious, and her subjects
talked about nothing else but her sickness. There was grief all through the water-world; from
the mermaids on their beds of sponge, and the dragons in the rocky caverns, down to the tiny
gudgeons in the rivers, that were considered no more than mere bait. The jolly cuttle-fish
stopped playing his drums and guitar, folded his six arms and hid away moping in his hole.
His servant the lobster in vain lighted his candle at night, and tried to induce him to come
out of his lair. The dolphins and porpoises wept tears, but the clams, oysters and limpets
shut up their shells and did not even wiggle. The flounders and skates lay flat on the ocean's
floor, never even lifting up their noses. There are however a few of reconcentrados about the streets have
today, and starvation has ended the field of the of them, and their castanets have been called
into the trenches outside-- metropolis.

"Hunger has now faces the Spanish citizens themselves. The cuttle-fish who professed to be "a kind of a" doctor, offered
the use of all his cups to suck out the poison, if that were the trouble.

But it wasn't. It was internal, and nothing but medicine that could be swallowed would reach
the disease.

At last some one suggested that the liver of a monkey would be a specific for the royal sickness,
and it was resolved to try it. The tortoise, who was the Queen's messenger, because he could
live on both land and water, swim or crawl, was summoned. He was told to go upon earth to a
certain mountain, catch a monkey and bring him alive to the Under-world.

Off started the tortoise on his journey to the earth, and going to a mountain where the monkeys
lived, squatted down at the foot of a tree and pretended to be asleep though keeping his claws
and tail out. There he waited patiently, well knowing that curiosity and the monkey's love
of tricks would bring one within reach of his talons. Pretty soon, a family of chattering monkeys
came running along among the branches overhead, when suddenly a young saru (monkey) caught
sight of the sleeping tortoise.

"Naru hodo" (Is it possible?) said the long-handed fellow, "here's fun; let's tickle the old
fellow's back and pull his tail."

All agreed, and forthwith a dozen monkeys, joining hand over hand, made a long ladder of themselves
until they just reached the tortoise's back. (They didn't use their tails, for Japanese monkeys
have none, except stumps two inches long). However, he who was to be the tail end of this living
rope, when all was ready, crawled along and slipped over the whole line, whispering as he slid:

"'Sh! don't chatter or laugh, you'll wake the old fellow up."

Now the monkey expected to hold on the living pendulum by one long hand, and swinging down
with the other, to pull the tortoise's tail, and see how near he could come to his snout without
being snapped up. For a monkey well knew that a tortoise could neither jump off its legs nor
climb a tree.

Once! Twice! The monkey pendulum swung back and forth without touching.

Three! Four! The monkey's finger-nails scratched the tortoise's back. Yet old Hard Shell pretended
to be sound asleep.

Five! Six! The monkey caught hold of the tortoise's tail and jerked it hard. Old Tortoise now
moved out its head a little, as if still only half awake.

Seven! Eight! This time the monkey intended to pull the tortoise's head, when just as he came
within reach, the tortoise snapped him, held him in his claws, and as the monkey pendulum swung
back he lost his hold. In an instant he was jerked loose, and fell head-foremost to the ground,
half stunned.

Frightened at the loss of their end link, the other monkeys of the chain wound themselves up
like a windlass over the branches, and squatting on the trees, set up a doleful chattering.

"Now," says the tortoise, "I want you to go with me. If you don't, I'll eat you up. Get on
my back and I'll carry you; but I must hold your paw in my mouth so you won't run away."

Half frightened to death, the monkey obeyed, and the tortoise trotted off to the sea, swam
to the spot over the Queen's palace, and in a fillip of the finger was down in the gardens
of Riu Gu.

Here, let me say, that according to another version of this story the monkeys assembled in
force when they suspected what the tortoise had come after, and catching him napping turned
him over on his back so that he could not move or bite. Then they took his under shell off,
so that he had to travel back to Riu Gu and get another one. This last version however is uncertain
and it looks like a piece of invention to suppose that the monkeys had a sufficient medical
knowledge to make them suspicious of the design of the tortoise on the monkey's liver. I prefer
the regular account.

The Queen hearing of the monkey's arrival thanked the tortoise, and commanded her cook and
baker to feed him well and treat him kindly, for the queen felt really sorry because he was
to lose his liver.

As for the monkey he enjoyed himself very much, and ran around everywhere amusing the star-fishes,
clams, oysters and other pulpy creatures that could not run, by his rapid climbing of the rocks
and coral bushes, and by rolling over the sponge beds and cutting all manner of antics.

 A dull thud, a frightful
howl, a heavy bump on the ground, and the writhing of some creature among the pebbles, told
in a few seconds time that the shaft had struck flesh. The next instant Yorimasa's retainer
rushed out with blazing torch and joined battle with his dirk. Seizing the beast by the neck,
he quickly despatched him, by cutting his throat. Then they flayed the monster, and the next
morning the hide was shown to his majesty.

All congratulated Yorimasa on his valor and marksmanship. Many young men, sons of nobles and
warriors, begged to become his pupils in archery. The mikado ordered a noble of very high rank
to present to Yorimasa a famous sword named Shishi-no-ō, (King of Wild Boars), and to give
him a lovely maid of honor named Ayami, to wife. And so the brave and the fair were married,
and to this day the fame of Yorimasa is like the "umé-také-matsu," (plum-blossom, bamboo and
pine), fragrant, green and ever-during.

WATANABE CUTS OFF THE ONI'S ARM.

When the capital of Japan was the city of Kioto, and the mikado dwelt in it with all his court,
there lived a brave captain of the guard named Yorimitsu, who belonged to the famous Minamoto
family. He was also called Raiko, and by this name he is best known to all the boys and girls
in Great Japan. Under Captain Raiko were three brave guardsmen, one of whom was named Watanabé
Tsuna. The duty of these men-at-arms was to watch at the gates leading to the palace.

It had come to pass that the blossom capital had fallen in a dreadful condition, because the
guards at the other gates had been neglected. Thieves were numerous and murders were frequent,
so that every one in the city was afraid to go out into the streets at night. Worse than all
else, was the report that oni or imps were prowling around in the dark to seize people by the
hair of the head. Then they would drag them away to the mountains, tear the flesh off their
bones, and eat them up.

The worst place in the city, to which the horned imps came oftenest, was at the south-western
gate called the Rajo-mon.

To this post of danger, Raiko sent Tsuna, the bravest of his guards.

It was on a dark, rainy and dismal night, that Tsuna started, well-armed, to stand sentinel
at the gate. His trusty helmet was knotted over his chin, and all the pieces of his armor were
well laced up. His sandals were girt tight to his feet, and in his belt was thrust the trusty
sword, freshly ground, until its edge was like a razor's, and with it the owner could cut asunder
a hair floating in the air.

Arriving at the red pillar of the gate, Tsuna paced up and down the stone way with eyes and
ears wide open. The wind was blowing frightfully, the storm howled and the rain fell in such
torrents that soon the cords of Tsuna's armor and his dress were soaked through.

The great bronze bell of the temples on the hills boomed out the hours one after another, until
a single stroke told Tsuna it was the hour of the Rat (midnight).

Two hours passed, and the hour of the Bull sounded (2 A.M.,) still Tsuna was wide awake. The
storm had lulled, but it was darker than ever.

The hour of the Tiger (3 o'clock) rung out, and the soft mellow notes of the temple bell died
away like a lullaby wooing one to sleep, spite of will and vow.

The warrior, almost without knowing it, grew sleepy and fell into a doze. He started and woke
up. He shook himself, jingled his armor, pinched himself, and even pulled out his little knife
from the wooden scabbard of his dirk, and pricked his leg with the point of it to keep awake,
but all in vain. Unconsciously overcome, he leaned against the gate-post, and fell asleep.

This was just what the imp wanted. All the time he had been squatting on the cross-piece at
the top of the gate waiting his opportunity. He now slid down as softly as a monkey, and with
his iron-like claws grabbed Tsuna by the helmet, and began to drag him into the air.

In an instant Tsuna was awake. Seizing the hairy wrist of the imp with his left hand, with
his right he drew his sword, swept it round his head, and cut off the demon's arm. The oni,
frightened and howling with pain, leaped up the post and disappeared in the clouds.

Tsuna waited with drawn sword in hand, lest the oni might come again, but in a few hours morning
dawned. The sun rose on the pagodas and gardens and temples of the capitol and the nine-fold
circle of flowery hills. Everything was beautiful and bright. Tsuna returned to report to his
captain, carrying the oni's arm in triumph. Raiko examined it, and loudly praised Tsuna for
his bravery, and rewarded him with a silken sash.

Now it is said that if an oni's arm be cut off it cannot be made to unite with the body again,
if kept apart for a week. So Raiko warned Tsuna to lock it up, and watch it night and day,
lest it be stolen from him.

So Tsuna went to the stone-cutters who made idols of Buddha, mortars for pounding rice, and
coffers for burying money in to be hidden away in the ground, and bought a strong box cut out
of the solid stone. It had a heavy lid on it, which slid in a groove and came out only by touching
a secret spring. Then setting it in his bed chamber, he guarded it day and night, keeping the
gate and all his doors locked. St. Cock, Leadership, cunning. I adore in Dai, brush can be to me strut them

 He selected five hundred of the most beauteous youths and virgins of his
kingdom, and, fitting out a fleet, sailed away to the Happy Isles of the East. Coasting along
the shore until they recognized the glorious form of the mountain, they landed and began the
ascent. Alas! for the poor king. The rough sea and severe storms had worn on his aged frame
and the fatigues of the ascent were so great, that before reaching the top he fainted away,
and before the head of the procession had set foot on the crater edge the monarch was dead.
Sadly they gave up the search for the elixir of life, and, descending the mountain, buried
their master in the Province of Kii. Then, in their exuberance of youth and joy, thinking little
of the far future and wishing to enjoy the present, they separated in couples, married, and,
disposing of their ship and cargo, settled in the country, and colonized the eastern part of Japan.

Long afterward, when Buddhist believers came to Japan, one of them, climbing Fuji, noticed
that around its sunken crater were eight peaks, like the petals of their sacred lotus flower.
Thus, it seemed to them, Great Buddha had honored Japan, by bestowing the sacred symbol of
Nirvana, or Heaven, on the proudest and highest part of Japan. So they also named it Fuji,
"the sacred mountain"; and to this day all the world calls this sacred mountain Fuji, or Fusi
Yama, while the Japanese people believe that the earth which sunk in Omi is the same which,
piled to the clouds, is the lordly mountain of Suruga.

THE WATERFALL OF YORO, OR THE FOUNTAIN OF YOUTH.

Long, long, ago, when the oldest stork was young, there lived an aged woodcutter and his son
on the slopes of the mountain Tagi, in the province of Mino. They gained a frugal livelihood
by cutting brushwood on the hill-side, and carrying it in bundles on their back to sell in
the nearest market town; for they were too poor to own an ox. With the money thus received
they bought rice and radishes, their daily food.

Only once or twice a year, at New Year's and on the mikado's birthday, could they afford to
treat themselves to a mess of bean-curd or fresh fish. Yet the old man was very fond of rice-wine,
and every week bought a gourd full to keep his old blood warm.

As the years rolled on the aged father's limbs became so stiff that he was unable any longer
to climb the mountains. So his son, now grown to be a sturdy man, cut nearly double the quantity
of wood and thus kept the family larder full. The old man was so proud of his son that he daily
stood at sunset in front of his rustic gate to welcome him back. And to see the old daddy and
the young stripling remove their headkerchiefs, and bow with hands on knees in polite fashion,
bending their backs and sucking in their breath, out of respect to each other, and to hear
them inquiring after one another's health, showering mutual compliments all the time, one would
have thought they had not seen each other for eight years, instead of eight hours.

One winter the snow fell long and thick, until all the ground in field and forest was covered
several feet over. The bamboo branches bent with their weight of white, the pine boughs broke
under their load, and even the stone idols along the wayside were covered up. At first, even
with the hardest work, the young woodcutter could scarcely get and sell wood to buy enough
food to keep them both alive. He often went hungry himself, so that his father might have his
warm wine.

One day he went by another path up one of the mountain dells with his rope basket strapped
to his back, and the empty gourd-bottle at his belt. While gloomily grieving over his hard
luck, the faint odor of rice-wine seemed borne on the breeze.

He snuffed the air. It was no mistake. "Here's luck, surely," said he, throwing down his bundle.

Hurrying forward he saw a foaming waterfall tumbling over the rocks in a thick stream.

As he drew near, some of the spray fell on his tongue. He tasted it, smacked his lips and throwing
down his cord and basket to the ground, filled his gourd and hastened home to his father.

Every day, till the end of his father's life, did he come to this wonderful cascade of wine,
and thus the old man was nourished for many a long year.

The news of this fountain of youth spread abroad until it reached the court. The mikado, hearing
of it, made a journey to Mino to see the wonderful waterfall. In honor of this event, and as
a reward of filial piety, the name of the year-period was changed to Yoro, (Nourishing Old Age).

       *       *       *       *       *

To this day, many people young and old go out to enjoy picnic parties at the foot of the waterfall;
which now, however, runs honest water only, which makes the cheeks red; and not the wonderful
wine that once tipped the old daddy's nose with perpetual vermilion.

THE EARTHQUAKE FISH.

Mukashi, mukashi, (as most Japanese stories begin), long, long ago, when the gods came down
from heaven to subdue the earth for the mikados, and civilize the country, there were a great
many earthquakes, and nothing to stop them. The world continually rocked, and men's houses
and lives were never safe.

Now the two gods who were charged with the work of subduing the northeastern part of the world
were Kashima and Katori. Having done their work well, and quieted all the enemies of the Sun-goddess,
they came to the province of Hitachi. Kashima, sticking his sword into the earth, ran it through
to the other side, leaving the hilt above the ground. In the course of centuries this mighty
sword shrunk and turned to stone, and the people gave it the name of Kanamé ishi, (The rock
of Kanamé).

Now Kanamé means the rivet in a fan, that holds all the sticks together, and they gave the
name "rivet-rock," because it is the rivet that binds the earth together. No one could ever
lift this rock except Kashima the mighty one who first set it in the earth.

Yet even Kashima never raises it, except to stop an earthquake of unusual violence. When the
earth quivers, it is because the great earthquake-fish or jishin-uwo is restless or angry.
This jishin-uwo is a great creature something like a catfish. It is about seven hundred miles
long, and holds the world on its back. Its tail is at Awomori in the north, and the base of
its head is at Kioto, so that all Japan lies on top of it. To his mouth are attached huge twirling
feelers, which are just like the hideous moustaches which the hairy-faced men from beyond the
Tai-kai (Pacific Ocean) wear on their lips. As soon as these begin to move, it is a sign that
the monster is in wrath. When he gets angry, and flaps his tail or bumps his head, there is
an earthquake. When he flounders about or rolls over, there is terrible destruction of life
and property on the surface of the earth above.

In order to keep the earthquake-fish quiet, the great giant Kashima is appointed to watch him.
His business is to stand near by, and when the monster becomes violent Kashima must jump up
and straddle him, and hold his gills, put his foot on his fin; and when necessary lift up the
great rock of Kanamé and hold him down with its weight. Then he becomes perfectly quiet, and
the earthquake ceases. Hence the people sing this earthquake verse:

         "No monster can move the Kanamé rock
            Though he tug at it never so hard,
          For over it stands, resisting the shock,
            The Kashima Kami on guard."

Another verse they sing as follows:

                  "These are things
                 An earthquake brings;
          At nine of the bell they sickness fortell,
              At five and seven betoken rain,
            At four the sky is cleared thereby,
           At six and eight comes wind again."

THE DREAM STORY OF GOJIRO.

Only a few years ago there was a gentleman in Fukui, Japan, who had a son, a bright lad of
twelve, who was very diligent at school and had made astonishing progress in his studies. He
was especially quick at learning Chinese characters, of which every Japanese gentleman who
wishes to be called educated must know at least two thousand. For, although the Chinese and
Japanese are two very different languages, yet the Japanese, Coreans and Chinese use the same
letters to write with, just as English, Germans, French and Spaniards all employ one and the
same alphabet.

Now Gojiro's father had promised him that when he read through five volumes of the Nihongi,
or Ancient History of Japan, he would give him for a present a book of wonderful Chinese stories.
Gojiro performed his task, and his father kept his promise. One day on his return from a journey
to Kioto, he presented his son with sixteen volumes, all neatly silk-bound, well illustrated
with wood-cuts, and printed clearly on thin, silky mulberry paper, from the best wooden blocks.
It will be remembered that several volumes of Japanese literature make but one of ours, as
they are much lighter and thinner than ours.

Gojiro was so delighted with the wonderful stories of heroes and warriors, travelers and sailors,
that he almost felt himself in China. He read far into the night, with the lamp inside of his
musquito curtain; and finally fell asleep, still undressed, but with his head full of all sorts
of Chinese wonders.

He dreamed he was far away in China, walking along the banks of the great Yellow River. Everything
was very strange. The people talked an entirely different language from his own; had on different
clothes; and, instead of the nice shaven head and top-knot of the Japanese, every one wore
a long pigtail of hair, that dangled at his heels. Even the boats were of a strange form, and
on the fishing smacks perched on projecting rails, sat rows of cormorants, each with a ring
around his neck. Every few minutes one of them would dive under the water, and after a while
come struggling up with a fish in its mouth, so big that the fishermen had to help the bird
into the boat. The game was then flung into a basket, and the cormorant was treated to a slice
of raw fish, by way of encouragement and to keep the bird from the bad habit of eating the
live fish whole. This the ravenous bird would sometimes try to do, even though the ring was
put around his neck for the express purpose of preventing him from gulping down a whole fish
at once.

It was springtime, and the buds were just bursting into flower. The river was full of fish,
especially of carp, ascending to the great rapids or cascades. Here the current ran at a prodigious
rate of swiftness, and the waters rippled and boiled and roared with frightful noise. Yet,
strange to say, many of the fish were swimming up the stream as if their lives depended on
it. They leaped and floundered about; but every one seemed to be tossed back and left exhausted
in the river, where they panted and gasped for breath in the eddies at the side. Some were
so bruised against the rocks that, after a few spasms, they floated white and stiff, belly
up, on the water, dead, and were swept down the stream. Behold, hitherto; and that is what we,

Vain was the prayer of priest, or spell of rosary, as the bonzes piteously besought great Buddha

THE FISHERMAN AND THE MOON-MAIDEN.

Pearly and lustrous white, like a cloud in the far-off blue sky, seemed the floating figure
of the moon-maiden, as she flew to earth. She was one of the fifteen glistening virgins that
wait attendant upon the moon in her chambers in the sky. Looking down from her high home to
the earth, she became enraptured with the glorious scenery of Suruga's ocean shore, and longed
for a bath in the blue waters of the sea.

So this fairy maid sped to the earth one morning early, when the moon having shone through
the night was about to retire for the day. The sun was rising bright and red over the eastern
seas, flushing the mountains and purpling the valleys. Out amid the sparkling waves the ships
sailed toward the sun, and the fishermen cast their nets.

It was in early spring, when the air was full of the fragrance of plum blossoms, and the zephyrs
blew so softly that scarce a bamboo leaf quivered, or a wave lapsed with sound on the silvery
shore.

The moon-maiden was so charmed with the scenery of earth, that she longed to linger above it
to gaze tranquilly. Floating slowly through the air, she directed her course to the pine groves
that fringe the strand near Cape Miwo. Lying at the base of Fuji mountain, whose snowy crown
glistens above, fronting the ocean, whose blue plain undulates in liquid glory till it meets
the bending sky, the scenery of Miwo is renowned everywhere under the whole heavens, but especially
in the land which the mikado's reign blesses with peace.

Full of happiness, the fairy maiden played sweet music from her flute, until the air was full
of it, and it sounded to the dweller on earth like the sweet falling of rain drops on the thirsty
ground. Her body shed sweet fragrance through the air, and flowers fell from her robes as she
passed. Though none saw her form, all wondered.

Arriving over a charming spot on the sea shore, she descended to the strand, and stood at the
foot of a pine tree. She laid her musical instrument on a rock near by, and taking off her
wings and feathered suit hung them carefully on the pine tree bough. Then she strolled off
along the shore to dip her shining feet in the curling waves.

Picking up some shells, she wondered with innocent joy at the rich tints, which seemed more
beautiful than any color in the moon-world. With one, a large smooth scallop, she was particularly
pleased; for inside one valve was a yellow disc, and on its mate was a white one.

"How strange," said she. "Here is the sun, and there is the moon. I shall call this the Tsuki-hi-kai--'sun
and moon shell'," and she put them in her girdle.

It chanced that near the edge of the pine grove, not far away, there dwelt a lone fisherman,
who, coming down to the shore, caught a whiff of sweet perfume such as had never before delighted
his nostrils. What could it be? The spring zephyrs, blowing from the west, seemed laden with
the sweet odor.

Curiosity prompted him to seek the cause. He walked toward the pine tree, and looking up, caught
sight of the feathery suit of wings. Oh! how his eyes sparkled. He danced for joy, and taking
down the robe carried it to his neighbors. All were delighted, and one old man said that the
fairy must herself be near by. He advised the man to seek until he found her.

So with feathered robe in hand the fisherman went out again to the strand, and took his place
near the pine tree. He had not waited long before a lovely being, with rose-tinted white skin
and of perfect form, appeared.

"Please good sir, give me back my feathered robe," said she, in a sad voice of liquid sweetness,
though she seemed greatly frightened.

"No, I must keep it as a sacred treasure, a relic from a heavenly visitor, and dedicate it
in the shrine yonder as a memorial of an angel's visit" said the fisherman.

"Oh, wicked man, what a wretched and impious thing to rob an inhabitant of heaven of the robe
by which she moves. How can I fly back to my home again?"

"Give me your wings, oh ye wild geese that fly across the face of the moon, and on tireless
pinions seek the icy shores in spring time, and soar unwearied homeward in autumn. Lend me
your wings."

But the wild geese overhead only whirred and screamed, and bit their sprays of pine which they
carried in their mouth.

"Oh, ye circling gulls, lend me but for a day your downy wings. I am prisoner here", cried
the weeping fairy.

But the graceful gulls hovering for a moment swept on in widening circles out to farther sea.

"Oh, breezes of the air which blow whither ye list! Oh, tide of ocean which ebbs and flows
at will! Ye may move all, but I am prisoner here, devoid of motion. Oh, good sir have pity
and give me back my wings," cried the moon-maiden, pressing her hands together in grief.

The fisher's heart was touched by the pathos of her voice and the glittering of her tears.

"I'll give back your winged-robe if you'll dance and make music for me", said he.

"Oh, yes, good sir, I will dance and make music, but first let me put on my feather-robe for
without it I have no power of motion."

"Oh, yes", said the suspicious mortal, "If I give you back your wings you'll fly straight to
heaven."

"What! can you not believe the word of a heavenly being, without doubting? Trust me in good
faith and you'll lose nothing."

Then with shamed face the fisherman handed to the moon-maiden her feathered robe, which she
donned and began to dance. She poured out such sweet strains from her upright flute that with
eye and ear full of rapture, the fisherman imagined himself in heaven. Then she sang a sweet
song in which she described the delights of life in the moon and the pleasure of celestial
residence.

The fisherman was so overjoyed that he longed to detain the fairy. He begged her to dwell with
him on earth, but in vain. As he looked, he saw her rising. A fresh breeze, rippling the face
of the sea, now sprang up, and wafted the pearly maiden over the pine-clad hills and past Fuji
mountain. All the time sweet music rained through the air until, as the fisherman strained
his eyes toward the fresh-fallen snow on Fuji's crest, he could no longer distinguish the moon-maiden
from the fleecy clouds that filled the thin air.

Pondering long upon the marvelous apparition, the fisherman resolved to mark the spot where
the fairy first descended to earth. So he prevailed upon the simple villagers to build a railing
of stone around the now sacred pine.

Daily they garlanded the old trunk with festoons of tasseled and twisted rice-straw. Long after,
when by the storms of centuries the old pine, in spite of bandages and crutches, and tired
of wrestling with the blast, fell down like an old man, to rise no more, a grateful posterity
cleared the space and built the shrine of Miwo, which still dots with its sacred enclosure
the strand of Suruga on which the fairy danced.

THE JEWELS OF THE EBBING AND THE FLOWING TIDE.

Chiuai was the fourteenth mikado of the Land of the Gods (Japan). His wife, the empress, was
named Jingu, or Godlike Exploit. She was a wise and discreet lady and assisted her husband
to govern his dominions. When a great rebellion broke out in the south island called Kiushiu,
the mikado marched his army against the rebels. The empress went with him and lived in the
camp. One night, as she lay asleep in her tent, she dreamed that a heavenly being appeared
to her and told her of a wonderful land in the west, full of gold, silver, jewels, silks and
precious stones. The heavenly messenger told her if she would invade this country she would
succeed, and all its spoil would be hers, for herself and Japan.

"Conquer Corea!" said the radiant being, as she floated away on a purple cloud.

In the morning the empress told her husband of her dream, and advised him to set out to invade
the rich land. But he paid no attention of her. When she insisted, in order to satisfy her,
he climbed up a high mountain, and looking far away towards the setting sun, saw no land thither,
not even mountain peaks. So, believing that there was no country in that direction he descended,
and angrily refused to set out on the expedition. Impossible not admire diversion; ill, wonder,
