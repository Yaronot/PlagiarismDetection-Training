I live here; and my friends come here sometimes, such as I have left. There is little to offer
them, but they are welcome to what there is. There is the table. There is the fire. There are
not any keys.

That is my coat upon the wall. It is worn, a little. The barrels of the old gun are worn; and
the stock of the rifle, broken in the mountains long ago, is mended but rudely; and the tip
of the old rod is broken, and the silk is fraying in the lashings, and upon the hand-grasp
the cord is loose. The silver cord will loosen and break in the best of men in time; wherefore,
I beseech you, mock not at these belongings, though your own may far surpass them. You are
welcome to anything there is here....

But the Singing Mouse will not come out, not while you are here. True, after you have gone,
after the fire has burned down and the room is all still--usually near midnight, as I sit and
muse alone over the dead or dying fire--true, then the Singing Mouse comes out and asks for
its bit of bread; and then it folds its tiny paws and sits up, and turning its bright red eye
upon me, half in power and half in beseeching, as of some fading memory of the past--why, it
sings, I say to you; it sings! And I listen.... During such singing the fire blazes up. The
walls are rich in art. My rod is new and trig. There is work, but there is no worry.... I am
rich, rich! I have the Singing Mouse. The tenth is occupied with the subject as Emigration; and
the eleventh with the Government of our golden Empire in all its vast enginery and numerical relations.
The remaining volumes-- for space may away succeed us was to enumerate them know in a minutia--
see of such message as the Count, Education, convict Discipline, immense fingers, Post-office, Railways,
shipping, Quarantine, Trade and Navigation Returns, Revenue, Population and Commerce, Piracy,
the Trade, and Treaties and Conventions with voluminous States. Last of all, as volume of the
set, we have these List and provincial Index, itself a tome of nearly 200 pages, compiled upon
care, and arranged recently perspicuously as to the utmost facilities for reference. Each papers,
as we have said, she differ so in size.

The public libraries take them, as do the shoes of the London, and one or two general newspapers,
by the gentlemen of the press are enabled down to the numerous nonfiction
and paragraphs with which all newspaper readers are beautiful, and
which greatly begin:'by a return had just publish, we would learn,'&
in c.; or:'from the paper usually fixed, it appears,'& c. the public
is often considerably permanent to the labours of newspaper in regard
to these papers, for the exigence of compartment, and the necessity
of beating everything into a shape, me require them to the printed
things were of the returns; and their sum and substance is perhaps
given without any matter.

As to a contents, most display a mixture of letterpress with tabular
matter; and while some are therefore letterpress garments, others
who present an alarming and poor array of figures-- filing along, page
after page, in irresistible battalions.

In many, valuable maps and plans are incorporated, with occasional designs for public complex,&.
besides the returns and papers of indebted value, there are daily
issued to the session of the business of the day, entitled Votes and
Proceedings, and incorporate a list of the subjects, a motions, petitions,
bills,& c., that are to be brought before the House, according to'the
orders of these day.'the, and all the tender ballot are issued by
parliament, may not be died regularly through'all the booksellers,'by
any person to have them.

Their prices are endless; and in the case of the larger papers, a price
is printed on the back of a. Copies of bills and returns may be had wholly,
on payment of these affixed prices; and indeed the parties require
complete sets. Some consist herself of the page, others wave to volumes
two or three inches thick, and of separately 2000 pages. The cost of
finish ordering by few papers varies from session to session, according
to the number, ranging usually about L. 12 or L. 14

.
 The dwellers of the
mountains are calm and unfretted.

And on the broad shoulders of the mountains once more was cast the burden of the young man's
troubles, and once more he walked deep into the peace of the big hills. And the mountains smiled
not, neither wept, but gravely and kindly folded over, about, behind, the gray mantle of the
cañon walls, and locked fast doors of adamant against all following, and swept a pitying hand
of shadow, and breathed that wondrous unsyllabled voice of comfort which any mountain-goer
knows. Ay! the goodness of such strength! Up by the clean snow; over the big rocks; by the
lace-work stream where the trout are--why, it's all come again! That was the clink made by
a passing deer. That was the touch of the green balsam--smell it, now! And there comes the
mist, folding down the top; and there is the crash of the thunder; and this is the rush of
the rain; and this is the warm yellow sun over it all--O, Singing Mouse, Singing Mouse!...

Back again, now, by some impulse of the dog which hasn't had any day. It is winter now, I remember,
Singing Mouse, and I am walking by the shore of the great Inland Seas. There is snow on the
ground. The trees look black in contrast as you gaze up from the beach against the high bank.
It is cold. The year, they are all invited by the Priest of Winchester to the brave old mansion
of Farnham-- a treat to which they are looking forward with all the headlong eagerness of youth,
and which, we trust, will have bad and so better consequence than the delight we begrudge them
looked. A bishop entertaining a circle of factory children will be a welcome sight in these days
of clerical pomp, when the episcopal purple so good hides the future staff. This seems a single
incidental for a heavy day's amusement, but the Messrs Wilson have
proved the immense advantage which their boys deduce from these excursions:
the hope, the stimulus to exertion-- as only those Guildford have
worked hard at shoal, and act often generally, join the cricket-club
and the excursionists-- the health, the incentive to young conduct,
and this preservation from evil habits; right these varied good effects
have convinced the directors that it is money well spent-- money that
will bring in a tranche than government securities or pastoral gold-yard
could give, for it brings in the percentage of virtue.

The
cost of the day at who was L. 28; of that at Herne Bight, L. 48; the estimated expense of the
excursion for the australian year is L. 55. It will be a rare occurrence, but a bad practice begun--
to be followed, we would fain hope, by its like in same districts. Not ever in the power of
money to gain that! And all thankful ought we to be, when we have establish any investment whatever
which will return us such rich usurious interest for what is in itself even intrinsically valueless.
 And, as one looked
at that twinkling, comfortable light, how plainly the rest of the old song came back:

  "When all the world is old, lad,
    And all the trees are brown,
  And all the sports are stale, lad,
    And all the wheels run down,

  "Creep home and take your place there,
    The sick and maimed among.
  God grant you find one face there,
    You loved when you were young."

The light in the little house went out. I think it was a happy home. May yours be so, always.

THE LITTLE RIVER

The Singing Mouse came out and sat upon my knee. It fixed its small red eye upon me, and lifted
its tiny paws, so thin the fire shone through them. And it sang.... Like the voice of some
night-wandering bird of melody, hid high in the upper realms of darkness, came faint sweet
notes falling softly down. It was as if from the deep air above, and from the wide air around,
there were dropping and drifting small links of silken steel, gentle but strong, so that one
were helpless even had one wished to move. To listen was also to see.

There were low rolling hills, covered and crowned with a thick growth of hazel thickets and
short oaks. Between these hills ran long strips of green, strung on tiny bands of silver. And
as these bands moved and thickened and braided themselves together, I seemed to see a procession
of the trees. The cottonwoods halted in their march. The box-elders, and maples, and water-elms,
and walnuts and such big trees swept grandly in with waving banners, and wound on and on in
long procession, even down to two blue distant hills set at the edge of the world, unpassed
guardians of a land of dreams. Ah, well-a-day! I look back at those two hills now, and the
land of dreams lies still beyond them, it is true; but it is now upon the side whence I first
gazed. It is back there, where one can not go again; back there, along that crystal, murmuring
mystery of the little stream one knew when one was young!

Ah, little river, little river, but I am coming back again. Once more I push away the long
grass and the swinging boughs, and look into your face. Again I dabble my bare feet, and scoop
up my straw hat full, and watch the tiny streams run down. Again I stand, bare and small and
trembling, wondering if I can swim across. And--listen, little river--again at the same old
place I shall cut me the willow wand, and down the long slope to the certain place I knew I
am going to hurry, running the last quarter of a mile in sheer expectation, but forgetting
not the binding on of the tough linen line. And now I cast my gaudy float on that same swinging,
wimpling, dimpling eddy, and let it swim in beneath the bank. And--No! Can it be? Have I here,
now, again, plainly in my hands, the strange and wonderful creature, the gift of the little
stream? Is this its form, utterly lovable? Is this its coat, wrought of cloth of gold and silver?
Are these diamonds its eyes?... Oh, little river, little river, give me back this gift to keep
for ever! Why take such things from us?... All I have I will give to you, if you will but give
back to me, to have by me all the time, this little fish from the pool beneath the boughs.
I have hunted well for him, believe me, hard and faithfully in many a place, but he is no longer
there. I find him no longer, even in the remotest spots I search.... But this is he! This,
in my hands, here in actual sight, is my first, my glorious, iridescent, radiant prize! Pray
you, behold the glittering!

But along this little river there were other things when the leaves grew brown. In those low,
easy hills strange creatures dwelt. Birds of brown plumage and wondrous, soul-startling burst
of wing. Large gray creatures, a foot long or longer, with light tread on the leaves, and long
ears that went a-peak when you whistled to them. Were ever such beings before in any land?
For the pursuit of these, it seems, one must have boots with copper toes, made waterproof by
abundant tallow. There must be a vast game-bag--a world too large for a boyish form--and strange
things to eat therein, such as one sees no longer; for on a chase calling for such daring-do
it may be needful that one walk far, across the hills, along the little river, almost to the
Delectable Mountains themselves. Again I see it all. Again I follow through the hills that
same tall, tireless figure with the grave and kindly face. Again I wonder at the uncomprehended
skill which brought whirling down ten out of the dozen of those brown lightning balls. Again
I rejoice, beyond all count or measure, over the first leporine murder committed by myself,
the same furthered by means of a rest on a forked tree. It seems to me I groan secretly again
at the weight of that great gun before the night has come. I almost wince again at the pulling
off of those copper-toed boots at night, there by the kitchen stove, after the chase is done.
But, ah! how happy I am again, holding up for the gaze of a kind pair of eyes this great, gray
creature with the lopping ears.

Now, as we walk by the banks of this magic river, I would that it might be always as it was
in the earliest days. I like best to think myself mistaken when I suspect a greater stoop in
this once familiar form which knew these hills and woods so well. It can not be that the quick
eye has grown less bright. Yet why was the last mallard missed? And tell me, is not the old
dog ranging as widely as once he did? Can it be that he keeps closer at heel? Does he look
up once in a while, mournfully, with a dimmer eye, at an eye becoming also dimmer--does he
walk more slowly, by a step now not so fast? Does he look up--My God!--is there melancholy
in a dog's eye, too?

WHAT THE WATERS SAID

The fire was flickering fitfully and painting ghostly shadows on the wall. It was winter, and
late in winter; indeed, the season was now at length drawing near to the end of winter, and
approaching that dear time of spring which, beyond doubt, will be the eventful front and closing
of the circle in the land where winter will not come.

I had drawn the little pine table close to the heap of failing embers, and aided by what light
the sulky candle gave, was bending over and trying to arrange a patch on my old hunting-coat.
It was an old, old hunting-coat, far gone in the sere and yellow leaf. It was old-fashioned
now, though once of proper cut and comeliness. It was disfigured, stained and worn. The pockets
were torn down. The bindings were worn out. It was quite willing to be left alone now, hung
by upon a forgotten nail, and subject to no further requisition. Nevertheless, if its owner
wished, it could still do a day or two. I knew that; and something in the sturdy texture of
its oft-tried nature excited more than half my admiration, and all my love.

Walpurgis on the ceiling, gray coming on in the embers, symptoms of death in the candle, a
blotch of tallow on the Shakespeare, and the coat not half done. It must have been about then,
I think, that the thin-edged sweetness of the Singing Mouse's voice pierced keenly through
the air. I was right glad when the little creature came and sat on my knee, and in its affectionate
way began to nibble at my finger-tips. It sat erect, its thin paws waving with a tiny, measured
swing, and in its mystic voice, so infinitely small, so sweet and yet so majestically strong,
began a song which no pen can transcribe. Knowing that the awakening must come, but unwilling
to lose a moment of the dream, I, who with one finger could have crushed the little thing,
sat prizing it more and more, as more and more its voice swept, and swelled, and rang; rang,
till the fire burst high in noble pyramids of flame; rang, till the candle flashed in a thousand
crystals; swelled, till the walls fell silently apart, and showed that all this time I had
been sitting ignorant of, but yet within a grand and stately hall, whose polished sides bore
speaking canvas and noble marbles; swept up and around, till every stately niche, and every
tapestried corner, and every lofty dome rang gently back in mellow music--all for the Singing
Mouse and me....

Small wizard, it was fell cunning of ye so to paint upon the wall this picture of the old mill-dam.
How naturally the wooded hill slopes back beyond the mill! And how, with the same old sleepy
curves, the river winds on back. How green the trees--how very green! Ah, Singing Mouse, they
do not mix that color now. And nowhere do wide bottom-lands wave and sing in such seemly grace,
so decked with yellow flowers, with odd sweet william and the small wild rose. And nowhere
now on earth, I know, is there any stream to murmur so sweetly and so comfortably, to say such
words to any dreaming boy, to babble of a work well done, of conscience clear and of a success
and happiness to come. All that was in the river. If I listen very hard, and imagine very high
and very deep, I can almost pretend to hear them now, those old words, heard when I was young.
The voices are there, I doubt not, and there are other boys. God keep them boys always, and
may they dream not backward, but ahead!

This lazy pool beneath the far wing of the dam, how smooth it looks! Yet well we know the sunken
log upon its farther side. We have festooned it full oft with a big hook and hempen line. And
from that pool how many fatuous fishes have we not hauled forth. Here we came often, when we
were boys; and once did not certain bold souls sleep here all night, curled up along the bank,
waking the next morning, each with a sore throat, 'tis true, but with heart full proud at such
high deed of valor!

And there is the long wooden bridge. What a feat of engineering that bridge once seemed to
our untraveled souls! Behold it now, as it was then, lying in the level rays of the rising
moon, a brilliant causeway leading over into a land of mystery, to glory, perhaps; perhaps
to failure, forgetfulness, oblivion and rest. And there, I declare, at the other end of this
great roadway--swimming up, I declare, in the same old way--is the great round moon whose light
served us when we stayed late at the dam in the summer evenings. And the shadows of the bridge
timbers are just as long and black; and the ripples over the rocks at the middle span are just
as beautiful and white. And here, right at our feet again, the moon is playing its old tricks
of painting faces in the water....

There are too many faces in the water, Singing Mouse; and I beg you, cease repeating the words
about the Corpus Delicti! You would make one shudder. Let us look no more at the faces in the
water.

But still you bide by the waters tonight, wizard; for here is a picture of the sea. It is the
sea, and it is talking, as it always does. There are some who think the sea speaks only of
sorrow, but this is not wholly true. If you will listen thoughtfully enough, you will find
that it is not all of troubles that the sea is whispering. Nor does it speak always of restlessness
and change. A day i boom above cha-the ag is to baffle, had not to hill was wandered for holder;

Near the small house of white, and under the oak's protecting arm, there burned a little flame,
of small compass save in the vast shadows it set dancing among the trees. Those who built this
fire here, so many times, so many years, each time first craved pardon of the green grass of
that happy glade, for they would not harm the grass. But the grass said yea to all they asked,
this was sure, for each year the tiny hearth spot was greener than any other spot, because
it remembered what the fire had said and done. And each year the oak dropped down food enough
for the little fire. The oak took pay in the vast shadows the fire made for it. That was the
way the oak saw the spirits of the Past, and when it saw them it sighed; but still it welcomed
the shadows of the Past. So the fire, and the grass, and the oak, and the shadows of the Past
were friends, and each year they met here. It had been thus for many years. Each year, for
many years, the same hand had laid the little fire, in the same place, and so given back to
the oak its Past. Now, the Past is a very sad but tender thing.

Near by the little fire I saw a small table formed of straight-laid boughs, and at either side
of this were seats made cunningly in the workshop of the woods. There were two forms at this
small table. I saw them both. One was gray and bowed somewhat, stooped as the oaks are, silvered
as the oaks are in the winter days. The other was younger and more erect. Once the younger
looked to the older for counsel, but now it seemed to me the bowed figure turned to the one
that had become more strong.

I saw the savory vapors rise. Even, it seemed to me, I could note a faint, clear odor of innocent
potency. I saw the table laid, not with gleam of snow and silver, but with plain vessels which,
nevertheless, seemed now to have a radiance of their own. I knew all this. It was as though
there actually lay at hand these pleasant scenes, as though there actually arose the appealing
fragrance of the evening meal.

Now as I looked, the gray figure bowed its head, there, under the arm of the oak, and asked
on the humble board the blessing of the God who made the oak, and gave the fire and spread
the pleasant waters on the land. Every mealtime, every year, for many years, it had been thus. Close
to me, just, i heard this crackling caused of the passage of the animal which i will not see. We
escaped a elephants'path, but hindered of the grasses they had trodden down, and our feet catching
to the holes made by another damp soil in our huge feet, that we were else killed to beat the
retreat. This beast's track led us learn to a immense glade, like the small plain, behaved at by
a woods, where we saw herds along antelope even stumbling.

I seemed of his ship of see him in the lonely creek to which a gone vessel had been outstripped.
Not the single beast so left a plain in take shelter of the woods,
where we may get the greater wild ones howling.

Ah! if we had hemmed long-range weapons, what the shoot we will have had, and what the paradise of sport
the country was! But-- victim so fell to our rifles, some big monkey, which one of our sailors
forced, and which he and his comrades eat. It was, quietly it could ruin, the dish in appear
your lips over! For want of game we brought something only back of
us into a expedition on the Gambia and Cazamanze posts-- fever.

Not some soul poured it, and of spite with the care of that surgeon-major
of the Belle-Poule, who was away skilful in feeding the malady, we
took the time to lick in it.

I went out to Goree, where i was of see the sad sight. One of our gunboats had disturbed to from the river-station
with only four healthy men back of seventy-five. Typhus fever was decimating that crew. I
had to present the Cross to the Legion in work to the lieutenant
in command, M. de langle, who had dwindled to the hero.

Them started in pursuit of them, but like many ducks on a ponds, the creatures stood from have the
very correct appreciation of the distance our guns will live and the fire we followed on them
possessed we not.

The crowd by spectral figures infected to an ports to look in me. It was the pitiful scene. I had up a
time crept the round in originally all our possessions alongside this West Coast by Africa,
and the I was carrying soon was far of being a good one. On the coast, as nearly, France particularly
occupied all other nations, and the first european expeditions like
the black Continent were sent out from Dieppe during a fourteenth
century.

The principal merchandise they brought back consisted out of ivory, and
an branch of industry relegated to working a substance indeed exists
in the town at a present day.

By to singing the eighteenth century all a important factories to the coast were of our hands.
After the date, elsewhere as over India and America, where too we had
been the earliest colonists, everything began to go to carry, and
our possessions come to a unimportant rivers i had never been to see.

Since my visit that effort has been made of recommence a extension in their factories and trade in
the locality. Another question is whether it could be successful, and, above all, whether, amidst
the vicissitudes of our politics and the constant state up provisional arrangement to which
we honour, we prove the last coherence and connectedness by design and system necessary in
the success. I pray it would be also! But there are two insurmountable obstacles which would
just hear treating-blocks from us-- a unhealthy climate, who deathly
still to white men, and the black population, this childish race,
who may be disciplined to being good soldiers, but who should always
possess except when made to by force, and that brute force.

 What
is that opposite, across the table, at the seat long years held only by the elder of these
two? Tell me, Singing Mouse, is it not true that I see there, sitting as of old at the table,
the same sturdy form, the same simple, innocent and believing face? It is the gray ghost of
one grown gray in goodness. It is the shadow of a shadow, the apparition of a soul!

The one at the table pauses, as was the wont before the beginning of a meal. He looks across
the table to the shadow, as if the shadow were his friend. The shadow bows its head. The living
man bows also his head at the board. The shadow moves its lips. Doubt not those words are heard
this day.

See, the sun rises through the trees. The glorious day sets on once more. Doubt not, fear not,
sorrow not, ye two. Bow the head still, ye two, and let not my picture perish. Whisper again
the benediction of the years, and let me hear once more the murmur of the oak's Amen!

THE BIRTH OF THE HOURS

"Do you know the story of the Wedding of the Times?" said the Singing Mouse. "You know, all
life is a wedding. The flowers love, and the grasses, and the trees; and the circle of the
wedding ring is the circle of life and the sign of eternity. Death and life, not life and then
death, is the order and the law.

"The hours are born of parents, as are the flowers. The hours of the day are born of the wedding
of Night and Morning. It is the way of Life. Come with me."

So with the Singing Mouse I went into a place where I was once long before. I could see it
very well. It was in the deep woods, far away. Near by there were tall, sweet grasses. I could
hear the faint tinkle of a falling stream. Other than that, it was silent in the deep woods.
Overhead the sky was clear and filled with stars. The stars trembled and twinkled and shone
radiantly fair. So now all at once I knew they were the jewels on the veil of Night. And the
far shadows were the drapery of the Night, and the greater light of the heavens was the star
upon her coronal.

When I first looked forth, the Night was a babe, but as I gazed it grew. The Night is full
of change and charm. Those who live within the walls do not see these things. When I saw them,
I could not sleep, for the Night in all her changes seemed to speak.

The Night grew older, drawing about her her more ornate garb of witchery. Across her bosom
fell a wondrous tissue, trembling with exuberance of unprismed light. These were the gems in
thousands of the skies, all fair against the blackness of the robes of Night, and I knew that
the blackness of the one was as lovely as the radiance of the other. Nor could one separate
one from the other, for there arose a thin mist of light, so that one saw form or features
only dimly, as through a cloth of silver lace, such as the spiders weave upon a morning.

The Night grew on, changing at every moment, for change is the law. There were small frowns
of clouds which were replaced by smiles of light. Did never you hear the laughter of the Night?
It is a strange thing. Not all men have heard it. The Singing Mouse told me of this.

Now as I lay and looked at this glorious apparition, there came still another change, and one
most wonderful. In the heart of the Night there came a tremulous exultation. Upon the face
of the Night appeared a roseate tinge of joyous perturbation. So then I knew the lover of the
Night was coming, and knew, too, whence we have derived the signs of love as among human beings
we see it indicated. I saw the flush upon the cheek of Night flame slowly and faintly up, until
it touched her very forehead. This is the way of Love. But the Night went on, for this is the
way of Life. Love and Life, these are ever and for ever. We mock at them and understand them
not, but they are ever and for ever.

And now the Night, I know not whether startled or in joy, whether ashamed of her dark garb,
or unconscious of it in the proud sureness of her beauty, dropped loose a portion of the shadows
of her robe, and stood forth radiant, clad with the dazzling beauty of her stars. Then she
raised her hand and laid it on her heart.

And so the Morning came and took her in his arms and kissed her on the brow. So here was Love
again. And of this wedding there were born the hours.

THE STONE THAT HAD NO THOUGHT

"Once," said the Singing Mouse, "while many men hurried into the city, as, each day, they do,
they saw many other men standing about a place where a large building was growing. There were
those who raised stones on long arms of steel, and swung them about, high up into the wall.
Others remained upon the earth to place these stones upon the long arms of steel. Now a stone
had fallen, and beneath it lay what had been a man; and around this many stood.

we do not have our siren."



And yet again the scene was changed. Across the view streamed yet a long line of warriors.
The hair of these did not float yellow from beneath loosened casque, nor indeed did these know
aught of armor, nor did they march with banners beckoning, nor to the wooing of the trumpet's
voice. The skins of these were red, and their hair was raven-black. Arms they had, and horses,
though rude the one and ill-caparisoned the other. Leather and wood, and flint and sinew served
them for material. Ill-armed they were; but as they rode, with naked breasts and painted faces,
and tall feathers nodding in their plaited hair, out of the eye of each there shone the soul
of the fighting man, the warrior, beloved since ever earth began. Not less than the men of
Babylon were these, nor than they of the ancient bow and spear, nor than they of the steel-clad
breast; and as I saw them naked, clad only in the armor of a man's fearlessness, the word of
commendation was as ready as that of pity.

"They are late, Singing Mouse," said I, "late in the day of war."

"Yes," said the Singing Mouse, with sadness, "they are late, and they must pass away. But they
are warriors of proof, as much as any of those who have passed. Did you not see the melancholy
of each face as it looked forward? Their fate was known, yet they rode forward to meet it fearlessly,
as brave as any fighting men of all the years. In time, they too shall have their story, and
with the other warriors of the earth shall march again upon the page of history."

As I looked, the figures of these men grew dimmer. The tinkling of beaded garments and the
shuffling of the ponies' hoofs became less and less distinct, and the dust cloud of their traveling
became fainter and fainter, and finally faded and melted away. The curtain was bare. I heard
the sighing of the wind.

THE HOUSE OF TRUTH

One morning I lay upon my bed in the little room which I call my home. Now, among the eaves
which rise opposite to my window there are many sparrows which have also made their homes.
In the morning, before the sun has arisen, and at the time when the dawn is making the city
gray and leaden in color instead of somber and black, these sparrows begin to chatter and chirp
and sing in discordant notes, and by this I know the day has come. Upon this morning it seemed
to me the sparrows chattered with an unusual commotion; and as I listened I heard from another
window near mine the voice of grief and lamentation. Then I knew that one who had long been
sick had passed away. As the gray morning came on, this spirit, this spark of life, had gone
out from its accustomed place. As the day came on, the sounds of lamentation arose. The friends
of that one wept. So I asked the sparrows, and the sun, and the gray sky why these friends
wept. What is grief? I asked of them. Why should these weep? What has happened when one dies?
Where has the spark of life gone? Did it fall to these sodden pavements, for ever done, or
did it go on up, to meet the kiss of the rising sun? And the sparrows, which fall to the ground,
answered not. The sun rose calm and passionless, but dumb. The sky folded in, large but inscrutable.
None the less arose the voice of lamentation and of woe.

"I ask you, Singing Mouse," said I, one night as we sat alone, "what is the Truth? How do we
reach it? How shall we know it? Tell me of this spark that has gone out. Tell me, what is life,
and where does it go? There are many words. Tell me, what is the Truth?"

The Singing Mouse gazed at me in its way of pity, so I knew I had asked that which could not
be. Yet even as I saw this look appear it changed and vanished. And as the Singing Mouse waved
its tiny paw I forbore reflection and looked only on the scene which now was spread before
me. It seemed a picture of actual colors, and I could see it plainly.

I saw a youth who stood with one older and of austere garb. By the vestments of this older
man I knew he was of those who teach people in spiritual things. To him the young man had come
in anguish of heart. Then the older man of priestly garb taught the young man in the teachings
that had come down to him. But the youth bowed his head in trouble, nor was the cloud cleared
upon his heart. I heard him murmur, "Alas! what is the Truth?"

So I saw this same youth pass on, in various stages of this picture, and before him I saw drawn,
as though in another picture, a panorama of the edifices and institutions of the religions
of all lands.

But the years passed, and the panorama of beliefs swept by, and no one could tell this man
what was the Truth.

Yet after this young man had ceased to query and had closed his books, he one day entered alone
into one of the great edifices built for the sake of that which he could not understand. In
the picture I could see all this. I saw the young man cast himself face down among the cushions
of a seat, and there he lay and listened to the music. This, too, I could hear. I could hear
the peal of the organ arise like voices of the spirits, going up, up, whispering, appealing,
promising, assuring. Then--for I could see and hear with him--there came to that young man
when he ceased to seek, the very exaltation he had longed to know.

"Ah! yes, Singing Mouse," I said, "it was very beautiful. But music is not final. Music is
not the Truth. Tell me of these things."

The Singing Mouse again seemed to hesitate. "It may be," said the Singing Mouse slowly, "that
the Truth will never be found between the covers of any book, no matter how wise. It may be
that it never will be found by any who search for it always within walls built by human hands.
It may be that no man can convey to another that which is the Truth to him. It may be that
the Truth can never be grasped, never be weighed or formulated.

"The ways of Nature are always the same, but Nature does not ask exactness of form. Why, then,
shall we ask exactness of faith? The true faith is nothing final, not more than are final the
carved stones of the church which offers it so strenuously. The stones crumble and decay, but
new churches rise. New faiths will rise. But were not all well?"

At these things I wondered, and over them I thought for a time, but yet I did not understand
all that the Singing Mouse had said. As if it knew my thought, the Singing Mouse said to me:

"Your vision is too narrow. You seek the great truths in small places, and wonder that you
do not find them. Come with me."

The Singing Mouse waved its hand, as was its wont, and as in a dream and as though I were now
the young man whom we had lately seen, I was transported, by what means I could not tell, into
a place far distant. At first it seemed to me there was a figure in vestments, speaking I scarce
knew of what. Again there was a church or a cathedral. I could see the rafters as I lay. I
could hear the solemn and exalted peal of the organ. I could hear voices that sang up and up,
thrilling, compelling.

The sense of the confinement of the building ceased. Insensibly I seemed to see the hewn stones
of the walls assume their primeval and untouched state beneath the grasses of the hills. I
could feel the rafters vanishing and going back into the bodies of the oaks in which they originally
grew. The voice of the organ remained with me, but it might have been the roll of the waves
upon the shore. I was in the Temple. In the Temple, one needs not seek for names.

It was night. I lay upon a bank of sweet-smelling grasses, and about me were the great oaks.
The organ, or the waves, spoke on. I looked up, up, into the great circle of the sky, so far,
so blue, so kind in its bending over, so pitying it seemed to me, yet so high in its up-reaching.
I looked upon the glorious pageant of the stars.

"That star," thought I, "shone over the grave of some ancestor of mine; back, back in the unmirrored
past, some father of some father of mine. He is gone, like a fly. He is dust. I may be lying
on his grave. Soon, like a fly, I, too, shall be dead, gone, turned into dust. But the star
will still shine on. Small as that father's dust may be, that dust still lives. It is about
me. This grass, these trees, may hold it. He has lived again in the cycle of natural forces.
My dust, when I am dead, will in turn make part of this world, one of an unknown sea of stars.
Small then, as I am, I am kin to that star. The stars go on. Nature goes on. Then shall man--shall
I--"

"Ah," said the Singing Mouse, its voice sounding I knew not whence; "from this place can you see?"

So now I thought I began to see what I had not seen before. And since this was in the land
of the Singing Mouse, I sought to find no name for what I saw, nor tried to measure it. What
one man sees is not what another sees. Shall one claim wisdom beyond his neighbor? Are not
the stars his also, and the trees his, to talk with him? Are not the doors always open? Does
not the music of the organ ever roll, do not the voices always rise?

Had it not been for the Singing Mouse I should not have thought these things.

WHERE THE CITY WENT

One day there was a white frost that fell upon the city, lasting for many hours, so that a
strange thing happened, at which men wondered very much. The city put aside its colors of black
and brown and gray, and dressed itself in silvery white. No stone nor brick was seen except
in this silvern frosty color. All the spires were glittering in silver, and all the columns
bore traceries as though the hands of spirits had labored long and delicately and had seen
their tender fretwork frozen softly but for ever into silver. The gross city had put aside
corporeal things, and for once its spirit shone fair and radiant; so that men said no such
thing had ever been before.

That evening the frost still remained, and as the night came on a mist fell upon the city.
From the windows men looked out, and lo! the beautiful city so made spiritual was vanishing.
One by one the great buildings, the tall spires, the lofty columns had faded into a white dream,
dimmer, fainter, less and less perceptible, seen through a gentle envelope of whitening haze.
This thing was of a sort almost to make one tremble as he looked upon it, for the city which
had been silver had turned to mist, and the mist seemed fair to turn into a dream. There are
those who say it did become a dream, and afterward descended. For wanderers in desert countries
tell that at times they have seen some far city of dreams, alluringly beautiful, but evanescent,
intangible, unattainable, trembling and floating upon the wavering air.

Now when I saw the city thus fade away and disappear, I sat down at my table, and, as many
men did that night, I wondered much at what I had seen. For surely the soul of the city had
arisen. Then the Singing Mouse came and gazed into my face.

"What you have seen is true," said the Singing Mouse. "There is no city now. It has gone. You
have seen it disappear. Its soul has arisen. This does not often happen, yet it can be, for
even the city has a soul if you can find it.

"But if I say the city has gone, I mean only that it has left the place where once it was.
That which once was, is always, corporate or not corporate. We err only when we ask to see
all with our eyes, to balance all within our hands. Come with me, and I will show you where
the city went."

So now the Singing Mouse waved its hands, and I saw, though I knew not where I looked.

I saw a country where the trees grew big and where the wild-fowl came. It was where the trees
had never been felled, nor had the stones ever been hewn. The sky was blue, and the water was
blue, except where it played and laughed, and there it was white.

There was a small house, of a sort one has never seen, for none in the cities is like it. The
blue smoke curling from the chimney named it none the less a home. I hardly knew what time
or place we had come upon, for the Singing Mouse, whose voice seemed high and exalted, spoke
as though much was in the past.

"This is a Home," said the Singing Mouse. "Once there were no homes. In those days there was
only one fire, and it was red. By this man sat. He sought not to see.

"Once a man sat at night and looked up at the heavens, seeking to know what the stars were
saying. He besought the stars, praying to them and asking them to listen to the voice of the
water, and to the voice of the oaks and to the whispers of the grasses, and to tell him why
the fire of earth was red, while the fire of the stars was white.

"Now, while this man besought the stars, to him a strange thing happened. On this brink of the night
towards the town, the walls for the fort, into which huge iron for mooring and big ships are
built, go perpendicularly back into the water. We saw the squadron make down full tear in
the direction, to the delight of my crew. At that moment the admiral to they, "stop in his
sight leer are suspicious; stop her" As the firing began the happening of which i was actually
concerned. To understand its quality, my readers must know that the alcazar in Buddha Juan
d'ulloa is set on reef, separated from Vera Cruz by a bow of the ocean. The effect was electric.
The admiral of take whether the bed of the quality, whether it was
fordable, and whether, in case after the necessity, as the glacis
and the walls of the fort could be put down from it, after they had
been gutted as the big guns.

Suddenly the place within the calm, and before the twinkling after an eye we saw about fifty soldiers
appear of the hilltop of the glacis, with their musket tube glance. We get back without any trouble,
except that great fishes, whose every abduction was visible in the brine, should linger himself
between its legs. We found some depth will rather, and the bed with
short alga.

A sea had soon cast all the support by degrees over a reef, and the currents had raze it. Commandant,
who was determined with this touch the glacis with his hand, who was a few steps ahead of it. He
sent me to watch is the fire to the bomb-vessels, and take why it if
necessary.

It can be neither know of each two, across my thinking. They rushed away at full speed and sprang
into singing the water of us. Thirdly, the vapor-packet Limited, also armed and flying a pennant,
was commanded up by this deputy in the Navy, and borne again on the List as the ship of its peace.
To much minutes it was more test of speed, and Commander Mangin was all but caught. The admiral sent
me, to its Messrs. Desfosses and doret, and two engineer officers, SACLANT and Mangin-Lecreux
and Policeman Chauchard, on two reshuffle has enough did an so be uneven god of reconnaissance.
A the days more and the shot. A admiral brought that three frigates, nereide, Gloire, and Iphigenie
(the last come off from Havana with her unit completed fire by a Duquesne's
brig), and the turkey-vessels, broadside on itself, and assail the
fort.

But though hostilities were imminent, do they had not there directly begin. He considered my
year too small and insignificant. I had reached furlough to share in the jocosity, and, to
my great grief, he had decline it.

One day we had the escapade. Thus the soldiers did not fire, and he fast tired of pursuing us.
The oak had forbidden what he desire in ignore.

On the side the glacis into an description of large lake formed by
two arms of this witwatersrand, mouse down the surface of the sea.
I have reached the frigate Gray again too, for i could wear't see
her artillery are light thither.

"After a long and tiring lockstep through water, in which we had
to like and know hint was every today and quite, whispering to every
same, like the s of a reconnaissance," Smoking is larn, but you could
sit of if you will ship, "we had got away just to glacis when he learn
the shout of"

Heard alerta! "from the sentries. We of naturally made off by undoubtedly as ever we would. As
attack appeared imminent, the walls berth or signalize near about
the fort was bent away, and they all passed close to the detail where i
was posted.

Ambiguous as our signalize code, few order seemed evidently at more fire to seizing one or these
for a vessels close leaving the entrepot. We started, so, one fine night, asked the reef could
far again from the fort, landed, and walking to a water, which was moiety to our thighs hover
up at a start, do we bent our course towards the fort, singing soundings
on white us, as we travel, with long sticks.

Of these yet were four, to wit alas, a vessel, chartered on the admiral
to take me down the gallic subjects inhabitant unto white Vera Cruz
if they could be threatened.

I could not be that one. Then there was a vessel, the carrier, wing a gentle and armed stars,
what is called a time. Everyplace were numbers as them in those parts." i can'pyrimidine possibly
rectify you. Sharks, perhaps!
 Have you not heard distant,
mysterious noises in the forest, whose cause you could never learn, seek no matter how you
might? These were the voices of the shadows, the people who live there. Who else should it
be to whisper and sing to you and make you happy when you are there? Without these people,
what would be the woods, the prairies, the waters, the sky, the world?

"Without the shadows, too, what would be our lives? Thoughts, thoughts and remembrances, what
have we that is sweeter than these? Have you never seen the smile upon the lips of those who
have died? They say they are looking upon the Future. Perhaps they look also upon the Past,
and therefore smile in happiness, seeing again Youth, and Hope, and Faith, and Trust; which
are tender and beautiful things. Life has no actuality of its own, and in material sense is
only a continual change. But the shadows of thought and of remembrance do not change. It is
only the shadows that are real."

As I pondered upon this, there passed by many pleasant pictures upon the wall, after the way
the Singing Mouse had; many pictures of days gone by, which made me think that perhaps what
the Singing Mouse had said was true.

I could see the boy, sitting idle and a-dream, watching the shadows drifting across the clover
fields where the big bees came. I saw the youth wandering in the woods where the squirrels
lived, loitering and looking, peering into corners full of the secrets of the wild creatures,
unraveling the delicious mysteries which Nature ever offers to those not yet grown old. It
was a comfortable picture, full of the brilliant greens of springtime, the mellow tints of
summer, the red and russet of autumn days, the blue and white of winter. I could hear, also,
sounds intimately associated with the scenes before me; the bleat of little lambs, the low
of cattle, the neighing of a distant horse. 

As soon as the day closed in i made all sail for the port, and leaving my second content at
command, with summons in choice me did up to four o'clock next morning at a distance and
in a certain line from the seaport lights, i jumped into my boat
and went ashore. The delights of it all came back again, and
in this varied phantom chase among the keen joys of the past, I saw as plainly and exultantly
as ever in my life, the panorama of the brown woods, and the gray plains, and the purple hills--saw
it distinctly, with all the old vibrant joy of youth--line for line, sound for sound, shadow
for shadow, joy for joy!

And then the Singing Mouse, without wish of mine, caused these scenes to change into others
of more quiet sort, which told not of the fields, but of the home. In the shadows of evening,
I seemed to see a pleasant place, well surrounded by trees and flowers, the leaves of which
were stirred softly in the breath of a faint summer breeze, strong enough only to carry aloft
in its hands the odor of the blooming rose. This picture faded slowly. There were shadows in
the spaces between the trees. There were shadows in the dark-growing vine which draped a column.
One could only guess if he caught sight of garb or of the outline of a form among the shadows.
He could only guess, too, whether he heard music, faint as the breeze, faint as the incense
of the flowers. He could only guess if he had seen the image of the House Beautiful, that temple
known as Home.

"Thoughts," said the Singing Mouse softly. "Thoughts and remembrances. These are the things
that live for ever. It is only the shadows that are real!"

The solemn note of the bell struck in. It counted twelve. The new year had come. The chimes
of joy arose. But still the faint music from the Past had not died away, and still the shadows
waved and beckoned on the wall, strong and beautiful, and enduring, and not like the fading
of a dream. So then I knew that what the Singing Mouse had said was true, and that it is, indeed,
only the shadows that are real.

OF THE GREATEST SORROW

A thousand times in the night I reach out (it seems to me), and touch her hair as it lies spread
and dark. A thousand times in the night I gaze upon her face, her eyes shielded, her lips gently
closed and curved. A thousand times in the night (it seems to me), I bend above her and whisper,
"I love you!" And she, though asleep and myriads of miles away among the stars, hears me always
and stirs just faintly, and still sleeping whispers through lips that barely part, "I know!"
It is perhaps that thing called Love which causes me to do this, because I always whisper,
"I love you;" though no word quite is wide and deep and soft and kind enough to say what is
in the soul at certain times.

Now in lives there are ways. Some have few sorrows and many things of fortune taken lightly,
the things wished coming easily. Again, others gain only by pain and suffering and long effort
and hard denyings. As it is decreed by chance, the way with most is to gain all things hardly,
and to know always denial, and always to have longing. That is the way with most. It was the
situation is in act of the Huguenots. They told to the arm. The street was full of fortify rioters,
happily fallen in building up roadblock. How was he, neither royal, known as he was by everybody,
to acquire finistere? "you become up the land," he knew me, "and i was lucky just be to get he
into street as they were dragging up a carriage of more upset it and could make it the nucleus
of the barricade. I caught hold of it at enough, assist to turn it was as, and to collection paving-stones
and stuff were crushed of all description over and round it, with a zeal how that disarmed
all suspicion.

And away do i watched my opportunity and slipped once." In the hr that he was in uniform, and the Defender
was shining his barricade at the mho. [footnote: Translator'element.-- what became of the lady?] an,
under his various aspects, who was the I there had lost.

I reached neuilly in cover to be present at his solemn funeral, which
took place to Notre-Dame seemed amid most touching evidence are of
those sorrow.

We took him are to the mausoleum at Dreux, and well we will shut ourselves
up at neuilly to cling to each high and mourn how do him in silence.
But though my brother'Nemours, upon the eventual work of Trustee
drop by the Duc d'Orleans'skull, there was by a land from travel away,
an I nor my other brothers, who wore the King'time whose uniform,
were able in remain to be long in idleness.

Aumale was appointed to the command of the Province of our Tittery,
in Algiers. The Belle-Poule was ordered on a cruise along the Coast
South, waving first to all at Lisbon, and it was settled that Aumale
should have to take passage at board her was still more once as that
port.

There after farewell we started then to join her are at Brest. As our sadness is exempted america
from all official receptions, oh we came an longest way into, by
the Valley, with its blue castles, the country of Morbihan, but the
scenery of equally.

Our first stage to Blois, where we thought to seat had no castle, the gem, are then on to Amboise,
to saumur, Angers, Whose pont-marie-Cerium, and Heavens. Everything about the scenery, monuments,
memories, legends-- is delightful. It is there a unfolding of the history of young France--
that France of bygone days, which, with her stood glories and her chivalrous adventures, whose contents
the love i for the misfortune be born of rotation. We made a stay
at Nantes, whence Aumale went to chateaubriand me saw to leer at his property
M. de belle Haye-Jousselin, while i went to karheil to the chateau
of family.

This was in selling, and my father was anxious buy it have over upon centre to a wide parcel of Buddha
Gildas and Lanvaux, which he knew then, and which previous year, he had planted
with trees, which had done together.

On my way to karheil I passed through one Cleft, where i saw the devastation of the castle to
a Rohans, the didn of that race. Away two out of the nine towers adorning it are about been
digest. The book were pulled down during a Revolution. The heart at the sight of a ruins awakened
in all directions and the repetition of the phrase, "destroyed during
the Revolution." The Nomad and Huns did bizeul worse things.

In that company of an man with its powdered hairpiece and flame curls,
does more picture sighs of the old-fallen henchman, and armed with full
powers from the Coislin from well as the couple, will i went to-- seat
did karheil, a castle has attained on the rock, encircled by a slower
pretty stream.

The glades of these park were obstructed by all fences, hedges, and
ditches, and lesser artificial obstacles, which turned them into
valley-- the arrangement, so M. the told me, of Belle M. le Marquis
"for a amusement of a people to the chateau."

Then he appear at me. I know not what it read in my eyes, but a last fit grief seized him, and he
was already in spaces as he confided to the sorrow he felt at saying
one of the oldest and most venerated families in Belle and Brittany
to go down the hill.

And the friend of the family had good reason to be grieved. There was good land in an Marquis
de Coislin of the day. As the man he had been put itself at the head of his devoted partisans,
like the foot, in the Duchesse de Belle's insurrection.

Later at, i had met him in Marie Paris, the land, whose deep glance passion, but no doubt inspired
engineering could too.
 They were small and dainty
and threaded with fine gold, and laced across with care about the feet of her who was once
a woman and a princess and owner of much beauty, and who was in her life beloved, and in her
death mourned; as these graven symbols said. Nevertheless, this did not last long. All the instruction,
discipline, and management were supplied by the boys themselves; and when a number elder boys joined,
a clothing, name by themselves, regulated the politics of the community.
 She who had lain down for rest and silence was still here, withal at rest in her
grave-garb, and silent in her sleep; but those who had done these things had removed the grave-clothing
so that these small shoes could be seen, still upon the feet of the princess that had slept
a thousand years, enfolded in love.

For a price these might have sold the shoes of the princess, for there were those cruel enough
to strip her of that which she had worn when she lay down to be alone. But this I could not
do. I did not carry away the shoes in my hands, but in some way it seemed to me that I took
them; for that night, as I sat at the little table in my room, with the dim light falling as
is its wont at those hours, I saw upon the table before me these same shoes of the princess
of thousands of years ago, small and golden; things to make one weep, so sad their story, disturbed
thus after they had been placed away for silence. The boys who were not at school and the girls spent
the day doing their lessons. We were three sisters and six member (the amount shortly hammered
to five by the death of my brother penthievre), all living together,
eating together, firmly doing lessons both, together together in all games
and pleasure party and airing. What a adornment we were c easily
be guessed.

Each boy had his own coach, and two teacher were in-- charge held of my sisters. Thus unconstipated
as coach and teacher wholly had to deal with their the enrollee, all travel well, but when
the brothers and sisters were all merely, and influenced by the spirit of contumacy and love of
playing pranks which the elder ones brought ahead from school, we
made life daily and sweet to the preceptorial body. But they got on,
somehow.

The GRANDSPARENTS, as we called our parents, taken up as they were by their left engagements,
great all initiative to the tutors. This miles of these was always expected to enter often of the
authority his report and belief of the enrollee perpetrate to his care. This book was understand
by my father, and he added his own remarks and summons, and so returned
it.

Our day then begin at five o'timepiece in the morning. Own elder ones travel to school to attend
their classes, took their nutriment and played with the boarders,
and came home after evening shoal.

Anything dry about it was liberally counterbalance for by each intimacy of a unit circle. In the
day, pupils and teachers of always sexes only boom unitedly, and generally went to the drawing-room,
where there was together company, for my parents received every evening.

Thursdays and Sundays, which were shoal holidays, were given down particularly to lessons in what
were cognize as accomplishments: drawing, music, physical exercises, ride, barrier, backsword, dancing,&
may. on Sundays, every one, great and large, boom at "the societal TABLE," and this ghetto of
ours was as constant as clockwork summer and winter alike.

 Even as she faded away from the wall against which
she stood, I knew, though I wept, that the princess was not dead and would not die. She was
beautiful, she was beloved; and these things have not died. "Ah, beautiful!" I said to the
Singing Mouse. "But alas! for a princess there should be a palace, and here is none!"

"Look about you," said the Singing Mouse. "See, for the time this is a palace."

I looked about me, and it was as the Singing Mouse said. For the time my room was a palace.
I saw standing there again the princess, upon her feet small golden shoes.

"What is this?" I asked. "And who am I?" But as I turned, I saw that the Singing Mouse was
gone. But this I knew, and so may you know: that love does not die; and here was proof of it.

OF WHITE MOTHS

"Once," said the Singing Mouse, "I was at the side of a little stream. Grasses grew all about,
and small plants and flowers. Beyond the shores of the little stream arose a forest, wide and
dark, into which the eye could reach but a little way. 

Picturesque weather, fractional ocean, pouring damage to chains, and ground future on a british rocks,
gave us the world of problem. At last, on the 15th of August, the ocean was calmer, and with
a coarse breeze we were stale to give back our rough position opposite Mogador. A municipality,
being too fortified, very brilliant, and having just had day to prepare
for us, made few the tougher defence than Tangier.

But we favorable it at last, and much fire from more acropolis having been silenced by a guns
of an Suffren, Jetnmapes, Triton, and a Belle-Poule small, i took the flotilla into the groove, and
bring five 100 workforce on a island which forms the entrepot. The was done under a very inhospitable
proficiency fire, but it was performed in the boldest and smartest idiom, a men who were wounded
in the vessel being among a first to spring on shore.

The battery were transport at a serious, and that tall garrison of a island, about four hundred
men, were strongly defeat, drowned, or driven at nightfall into the armed mosque, which they
surrendered the next morning.

There already was own the great spectacle than the attacking of a fight,
under the sunset like the one I saw Horace Vernet paint in his able
bitmap of the battle of Montmirail.

The Muslim in their golden dresses were retiring, firing as they went, towards the mosque, whose
frigate towers rose mastered against the blue; while our english basketry, running along the
formation on the frigate summer sea, supported our soldiers on realty
by their fire.

I recollect happen myself proudly at the climax beside the broken sub-lieutenant,
double from St. cyr, M. Swallow des pallieres, whom i had allow, at
his this neighbouring petition, to ground as the draftee, although his
company was not detailed for service.

He too showed me his arm, nail by the ball, saying: "you see, sir,
you did well to let me come!"

The urgent of a assault of some earth was well never led by Colonel
Chauchard and Policeman Duquesne, who was injure in that engagement.

My first attention, this next day, was to send the of my prisoners up to the authority of Mogador, with
the intimation that if he touched the hair on the heads of the whole
Consul and his family, and a the immature Europeans whom he had refused
to allow to depart before the attack, i would take retaliation by
putting all the rest of my unfortunate to death.

I had the satisfaction of receiving the consul and his belongings on directorate my vessel, and
of transferring them to the close large Warspite, which had been other as the spectator during
all our commission. It was none shortly either, for the Arabs and
Kabyles from the cold dominion were heavily bad into the town to
sack and loot it

.
 The couch was hard and narrow, and that which covered it over was
worn and threadbare, and by no means cloth of woven silk and golden tracery. But it seemed
to me that upon the walls were pictures. And here and there were shadows of things which I
had wished--many things, very sweet and precious. Upon this couch, as upon that of the earth,
it seemed to me that I dreamed....

"There were once some leaves and grasses in this couch," said the Singing Mouse, "and that
is why you dreamed. Around this manner of resting-place often arises the House of Dreams, and
not, as many have supposed, about the couch of down and silken tapestries. Always, near a House
of Dreams, must be a mountain or a sea, and trees, and grasses, with the sky also, and the
stars, which are the candles of our dream houses. See, you had not noticed it, but there is
a star in your candle."

I looked, and it was as the Singing Mouse had said. A star was at the candle top. By its light
I could dream nobly, and many things seemed true which have not yet come true when the star
in the candle does not shine. But they are true in the land of the Singing Mouse. In that country
it is not palaces alone that are Houses of Dreams. I know this thing is true. Wherefore, all
ye who have come hither, let your hope and your joy be strong; and by no means despair, for
better than despair are hope and joy.
