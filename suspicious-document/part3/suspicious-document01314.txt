The glorious battle of Leipzig effected a great change in the conduct of Gustavus Adolphus,
as well as in the opinion which both friends and foes entertained of him.  Successfully had
he confronted the greatest general of the age, and had matched the strength of his tactics
and the courage of his Swedes against the elite of the imperial army, the most experienced
troops in Europe.  From this moment he felt a firm confidence in his own powers--self-confidence
has always been the parent of great actions.  In all his subsequent operations more boldness
and decision are observable; greater determination, even amidst the most unfavourable circumstances,
a more lofty tone towards his adversaries, a more dignified bearing towards his allies, and
even in his clemency, something of the forbearance of a conqueror.  His natural courage was
farther heightened by the pious ardour of his imagination.  He saw in his own cause that of
heaven, and in the defeat of Tilly beheld the decisive interference of Providence against his
enemies, and in himself the instrument of divine vengeance.  Leaving his crown and his country
far behind, he advanced on the wings of victory into the heart of Germany, which for centuries
had seen no foreign conqueror within its bosom.  The warlike spirit of its inhabitants, the
vigilance of its numerous princes, the artful confederation of its states, the number of its
strong castles, its many and broad rivers, had long restrained the ambition of its neighbours;
and frequently as its extensive frontier had been attacked, its interior had been free from
hostile invasion.  The Empire had hitherto enjoyed the equivocal privilege of being its own
enemy, though invincible from without.  Even now, it was merely the disunion of its members,
and the intolerance of religious zeal, that paved the way for the Swedish invader.  The bond
of union between the states, which alone had rendered the Empire invincible, was now dissolved;
and Gustavus derived from Germany itself the power by which he subdued it.  With as much courage
as prudence, he availed himself of all that the favourable moment afforded; and equally at
home in the cabinet and the field, he tore asunder the web of the artful policy, with as much
ease, as he shattered walls with the thunder of his cannon. Uninterruptedly he pursued his
conquests from one end of Germany to the other, without breaking the line of posts which commanded
a secure retreat at any moment; and whether on the banks of the Rhine, or at the mouth of the
Lech, alike maintaining his communication with his hereditary dominions.

The consternation of the Emperor and the League at Tilly's defeat at Leipzig, was scarcely
greater than the surprise and embarrassment of the allies of the King of Sweden at his unexpected
success.  It was beyond both their expectations and their wishes.  Annihilated in a moment
was that formidable army which, while it checked his progress and set bounds to his ambition,
rendered him in some measure dependent on themselves. He now stood in the heart of Germany,
alone, without a rival or without an adversary who was a match for him.  Nothing could stop
his progress, or check his pretensions, if the intoxication of success should tempt him to
abuse his victory.  If formerly they had dreaded the Emperor's irresistible power, there was
no less cause now to fear every thing for the Empire, from the violence of a foreign conqueror,
and for the Catholic Church, from the religious zeal of a Protestant king.  The distrust and
jealousy of some of the combined powers, which a stronger fear of the Emperor had for a time
repressed, now revived; and scarcely had Gustavus Adolphus merited, by his courage and success,
their confidence, when they began covertly to circumvent all his plans. Through a continual
struggle with the arts of enemies, and the distrust of his own allies, must his victories henceforth
be won; yet resolution, penetration, and prudence made their way through all impediments. 
But while his success excited the jealousy of his more powerful allies, France and Saxony,
it gave courage to the weaker, and emboldened them openly to declare their sentiments and join
his party.  Those who could neither vie with Gustavus Adolphus in importance, nor suffer from
his ambition, expected the more from the magnanimity of their powerful ally, who enriched them
with the spoils of their enemies, and protected them against the oppression of their stronger
neighbours.  His strength covered their weakness, and, inconsiderable in themselves, they acquired
weight and influence from their union with the Swedish hero.  This was the case with most of
the free cities, and particularly with the weaker Protestant states.  It was these that introduced
the king into the heart of Germany; these covered his rear, supplied his troops with necessaries,
received them into their fortresses, while they exposed their own lives in his battles.  His
prudent regard to their national pride, his popular deportment, some brilliant acts of justice,
and his respect for the laws, were so many ties by which he bound the German Protestants to
his cause; while the crying atrocities of the Imperialists, the Spaniards, and the troops of
Lorraine, powerfully contributed to set his own conduct and that of his army in a favourable light.

If Gustavus Adolphus owed his success chiefly to his own genius, at the same time, it must
be owned, he was greatly favoured by fortune and by circumstances.  Two great advantages gave
him a decided superiority over the enemy.  While he removed the scene of war into the lands
of the League, drew their youth as recruits, enriched himself with booty, and used the revenues
of their fugitive princes as his own, he at once took from the enemy the means of effectual
resistance, and maintained an expensive war with little cost to himself. She write to London: i stand

  The menacing preparations amidst which Gustavus Adolphus now compelled them
to decide, would lessen the guilt of their revolt in the eyes of the Emperor, and by an appearance
of compulsion justify the step which they willingly took.  The gates were therefore opened
to the King of Sweden, who marched his army through this imperial town in magnificent procession,
and in admirable order.  A garrison of 600 men was left in Saxenhausen; while the king himself
advanced the same evening, with the rest of his army, against the town of Hoechst in Mentz,
which surrendered to him before night.

While Gustavus was thus extending his conquests along the Maine, fortune crowned also the efforts
of his generals and allies in the north of Germany.  Rostock, Wismar, and Doemitz, the only
strong places in the Duchy of Mecklenburg which still sighed under the yoke of the Imperialists,
were recovered by their legitimate sovereign, the Duke John Albert, under the Swedish general,
Achatius Tott.  In vain did the imperial general, Wolf Count von Mansfeld, endeavour to recover
from the Swedes the territories of Halberstadt, of which they had taken possession immediately
upon the victory of Leipzig; he was even compelled to leave Magdeburg itself in their hands.
The Swedish general, Banner, who with 8,000 men remained upon the Elbe, closely blockaded that
city, and had defeated several imperial regiments which had been sent to its relief.  Count
Mansfeld defended it in person with great resolution; but his garrison being too weak to oppose
for any length of time the numerous force of the besiegers, he was already about to surrender
on conditions, when Pappenheim advanced to his assistance, and gave employment elsewhere to
the Swedish arms.  Magdeburg, however, or rather the wretched huts that peeped out miserably
from among the ruins of that once great town, was afterwards voluntarily abandoned by the Imperialists,
and immediately taken possession of by the Swedes.

Even Lower Saxony, encouraged by the progress of the king, ventured to raise its head from
the disasters of the unfortunate Danish war.  They held a congress at Hamburg, and resolved
upon raising three regiments, which they hoped would be sufficient to free them from the oppressive
garrisons of the Imperialists.  The Bishop of Bremen, a relation of Gustavus Adolphus, was
not content even with this; but assembled troops of his own, and terrified the unfortunate
monks and priests of the neighbourhood, but was quickly compelled by the imperial general,
Count Gronsfeld, to lay down his arms.  Even George, Duke of Lunenburg, formerly a colonel
in the Emperor's service, embraced the party of Gustavus, for whom he raised several regiments,
and by occupying the attention of the Imperialists in Lower Saxony, materially assisted him.

But more important service was rendered to the king by the Landgrave William of Hesse Cassel,
whose victorious arms struck with terror the greater part of Westphalia and Lower Saxony, the
bishopric of Fulda, and even the Electorate of Cologne.  It has been already stated that immediately
after the conclusion of the alliance between the Landgrave and Gustavus Adolphus at Werben,
two imperial generals, Fugger and Altringer, were ordered by Tilly to march into Hesse, to
punish the Landgrave for his revolt from the Emperor.  But this prince had as firmly withstood
the arms of his enemies, as his subjects had the proclamations of Tilly inciting them to rebellion,
and the battle of Leipzig presently relieved him of their presence.  He availed himself of
their absence with courage and resolution; in a short time, Vach, Muenden and Hoexter surrendered
to him, while his rapid advance alarmed the bishoprics of Fulda, Paderborn, and the ecclesiastical
territories which bordered on Hesse.  The terrified states hastened by a speedy submission
to set limits to his progress, and by considerable contributions to purchase exemption from
plunder.  After these successful enterprises, the Landgrave united his victorious army with
that of Gustavus Adolphus, and concerted with him at Frankfort their future plan of operations. 

A great battalion occupy the Abbey, and the rendition, in Sir s Bridge's setting, on "crossing
the Barroom" by the Abbey Choir sent the "wild reverberation" up the
through man'Frederick verse flying of and of alive the great arches
overhead with a dramatic effect not to be forgotten.  Among them
was the fugitive King of Bohemia, the Palatine Frederick V., who had hastened from Holland
to throw himself into the arms of his avenger and protector.  Gustavus gave him the unprofitable
honour of greeting him as a crowned head, and endeavoured, by a respectful sympathy, to soften
his sense of his misfortunes. You understand, my lord, His mister. Holbein has comely contributions
