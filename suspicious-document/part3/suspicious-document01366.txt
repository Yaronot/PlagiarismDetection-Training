From shadowy room to shadowy room, past great dark bins filled with the leaves, past big black
steaming vats, oozing sweet-smelling substances, past moist fragrant barrels, always among
the almost spectral forms of negroes, treading out leaves with bare feet, working over great
wicker baskets stained to tobacco color, piling up wooden frames, or operating the powerful
hydraulic presses which convert the soft tobacco into plugs of concrete hardness--so one goes
on through the factory. The browns and blacks of these interiors are the browns and blacks
of etchings; the color of the leaves, the old dark timbers, the black faces and hands, and
the ragged clothing, combined with the humming of negro voices, the tobacco fragrance, and
the golden dust upon the air, make an indescribably complete harmony of shade, sound, and scent.

The department in which the pipe tobacco is packed in tins is a very different sort of place;
here white labor is employed: a great many girls seated side by side at benches working with
great digital dexterity: measuring out the tobacco, folding wax paper cartons, filling them,
and slipping them into the narrow tins, all at a rate of speed so great as to defy the sight,
giving a sense of fingers flickering above the bench with a strange, almost supernatural sureness,
like the fingers of a magician who makes things disappear before your eyes; or like the pictures
in which post-impressionist and cubist painters attempt to express motion.

"May I speak to one of them?" I asked the superintendent.

"Sure," said he.

I went up to a young woman who was working, if anything, more rapidly than the other girls
at the same bench.

 But then, I suppose it is natural that the Chamber of Commerce
mind should thrust aside such things in favor of the mighty "goober," which is a thing of to-day,
a thing for which Norfolk is said to be the greatest of all markets. For is not history dead,
and is not the man who made a fortune out of a device for shelling peanuts without causing
the nuts to drop in two, still living?

[3] The Merrimac, originally a Federal vessel of wooden construction, was sunk by the Union
forces when they abandoned Norfolk. A Confederate captain, John M. Brooke, raised her, equipped
her with a ram, and covered her with boiler plate and railroad rails. She is called the first
ironclad. While she was being reconstructed John Ericsson was building his Monitor in New York.
The turret was first used on this vessel. It is worth noting that at the time of the engagement
between these two ships the Monitor was not the property of the Federal Government, but belonged
to C.S. Bushnell, of New Haven, who built her at his own expense, in spite of the opposition
of the Navy Department of that day. The Government paid for her long after the fight. It should
also be noted that the Merrimac did not fight under that name, but as a Confederate ship had
been rechristened Virginia. The patriotic action of Mr. Bushnell is recalled by the fact that,
only recently, Mr. Godfrey L. Cabot, of Boston, has agreed to furnish funds to build the torpedoplane
designed by Admiral Fiske as a weapon wherewith to attack the German fleet within its defenses
at Kiel.

And yet the modernness on which Norfolk so evidently prides herself is not something to be
lightly valued. Fine schools, fine churches and miles of pleasant, recently built homes are
things for any American city to rejoice in. Therefore Norfolk rejoices in Ghent, her chief
modern residence district, which is penetrated by arms of the Elizabeth River, so that many
of the houses in this part of the city look out upon pretty lagoons, dotted over with all manner
of pleasure craft. Less than twenty years ago, the whole of what is now Ghent was a farm, and
there are other suburban settlements, such as Edgewater, Larchmont, Winona and Lochhaven, out
in the direction of Hampton Roads, which have grown up in the last six or eight years. The
Country Club of Norfolk, with a very pleasing club-house on the water, and an eighteen-hole
golf course, is at Lochhaven, and the new naval base is, I believe, to be located somewhat
farther out, on the site of the Jamestown Exposition.

Norfolk is well provided with nearby seaside recreation places, of which probably the most
attractive is Virginia Beach, facing the ocean. Ocean View, so called, is on Chesapeake Bay,
and there are summer cottage colonies at Willoughby Spit and Cape Henry. On the bay side of
Cape Henry is Lynnhaven Inlet connecting Lynnhaven Bay and River with Chesapeake Bay. From
Lynnhaven Bay come the famous oysters of that name, now to be had in most of the large cities
of the East, but which seemed to me to taste a little better at the Virginia Club, in Norfolk,
than oysters ever tasted anywhere. Perhaps that was because they were real Lynnhavens, just
as the Virginia Club's Smithfield ham is real Smithfield ham from the little town of Smithfield,
Virginia, a few miles distant. On the bank of the Lynnhaven River is situated the Old Donation
farm with a ruined church, and an ancient dwelling house which was used as the first courthouse
in Princess Anne County; and not far distant from this place is Witch Duck Point, where Grace
Sherwood, after having been three times tried, and finally convicted as a witch, was thrown
into the river.

The several waterside places I have mentioned are more or less local in character, but there
is nothing local about Fortress Monroe, on Old Point Comfort, just across Hampton Roads, which
has for many years been one of the most beautiful and highly individualized idling places on
the Atlantic Coast.

The old moated fortress, the interior of which is more like some lovely garden of the last
century than a military post, remains an important coast artillery station, and is a no less
lovely spot now than when our grandparents went there on their wedding journeys, stopping at
the old Hygiea Hotel, long since gone the way of old hotels.

The huge Chamberlin Hotel, however, remains apparently unchanged, and is to-day as spacious,
comfortable and homelike as when our fathers and mothers, or perhaps we ourselves, stopped
there years ago. The Chamberlin, indeed, seems to have the gift of perennial youth. I remember
a ball which was given there in honor of Admiral Sampson and the officers of his fleet, after
the Spanish War. The ballroom was so full of naval and military uniforms that I, in my somber
civilian clothing, felt wan and lonely. Most of the evening I passed in modest retirement,
looking out upon the brilliant scene from behind a potted palm. And yet, when my companion
and I, now in our dotage, recently visited the Chamberlin, there stood the same potted palm
in the same place. Or if it was not the same, it was one exactly like it.

The Chamberlin is of course a great headquarters for army and navy people, and we observed,
moreover, that honeymooning couples continue to infest it--for Fortress Monroe has long ranked
with Washington and Niagara Falls as a scene to be visited upon the wedding journey.

There they all were, as of old: the young husband scowling behind his newspaper and pretending
to read and not to be thinking of his pretty little wife across the breakfast table; the fat
blonde bride being continually photographed by her adoring mate--now leaning against a pile
on the pier, now seated on a wall, with her feet crossed, now standing under a live-oak within
the fortress; also there was the inevitable young pair who simply couldn't keep their hands
off from each other; we came upon them constantly--in the sun-parlor, where she would be seated
on the arm of his chair, running her hand through his hair; wandering in the eventide along
the shore, with arms about each other, or going in to meals, she leading him down the long
corridor by his "ickle finger".

       *       *       *       *       *

I recall that it was as we were going back to Norfolk from Old Point Comfort, having dinner
on a most excellent large steamer, running to Norfolk and Cape Charles, that my companion remarked
to me, out of a clear sky, that he had made up his mind, once for all, that, come what might,
he would never, never, never get married. No, never!

CHAPTER XXV

COLONEL TAYLOR AND GENERAL LEE

    Forth from its scabbard all in vain
      Bright flashed the sword of Lee;
    'Tis shrouded now in its sheath again,
    It sleeps the sleep of our noble slain,
    Defeated, yet without a stain,
      Proudly and peacefully.

    --ABRAM J. RYAN.

Though I had often heard, before going into the South, of the devotion of that section to the
memory of General Robert E. Lee, I never fully realized the extent of that devotion until I
began to become a little bit acquainted with Virginia. I remember being struck, while in Norfolk,
with the fact that portraits of General Lee were to be seen in many offices and homes, much
as one might expect, at the present time, to find portraits of Joffre and Nivelle in the homes
of France, or of Haig in the homes of Britain. It is not enough to say that the memory of Lee
is to the South like that of Napoleon I to France, for it is more. The feeling of France for
Napoleon is one of admiration, of delight in a national military genius, of hero-worship, but
there is not intermingled with it the quality of pure affection which fully justifies the use
of the word love, in characterizing the feeling of the South for its great military leader--the
man of whom Lord Wolseley said: "He was a being apart and superior to all others in every way;
a man with whom none I ever knew, and very few of whom I ever read are worthy to be compared;
a man who was cast in a grander mould and made of finer metal than all other men."

Raleigh is situated within seven miles of the exact center of North Carolina. The land on which
the city stands was purchased by the State, in 1792, from a man named Joel Lane, whose former
house still stands. The town was then laid out in a one mile square, with the site selected
for the State Capitol directly at the center of it, and lots were sold off by the State to
individuals, the proceeds of these sales being used to build the Capitol. As a result the parks,
streets and sidewalks of the original old town still belong to the State of North Carolina,
and the city has jurisdiction over them only by courtesy of the State government. Raleigh has,
of course, much outgrown its original dimensions, and the government of the town, outside the
original square mile at the center, is as in other towns.

While Raleigh has not the look of age which characterizes many old southern cities, causing
them to delight the eye and the imagination, its broad streets have here and there a building
old enough to remove from the town any air of raw newness, and to make it a homelike looking
place. The sidewalks are wide; when we were in Raleigh those of the principal streets were
paved largely with soft-colored old red bricks, which, however, were being taken up and replaced
with cement. Not being a resident of Raleigh, and consequently not having been obliged to tread
the rough brick pavements daily, I was sorry to witness this victory of utility over beauty.

One of the pleasant old buildings is the Yarborough Hotel, at which my companion and I stayed.
The Yarborough is an exceedingly good hotel for a city of the size of Raleigh, especially,
it may be added, when that city is in the South. The Capitol, standing among trees in a small
park, also gathers a fine flavor from age. In one of the many simple dignified apartments of
this building my companion and I were introduced to the gentleman who was governor of the State
at the time of our visit. It seemed to me that he had a look both worn and apprehensive, and
that, while we talked, he was waiting for something. I don't know how I gathered this impression,
but it came to me definitely. After we had departed from the executive chamber I asked the
gentleman who had taken us there if the governor was ill.

"No," he replied. "All our governors look like that after they have been in office for a while."

"From overwork?"

"No, from an overworked jest--the jest about 'what the Governor of North Carolina said to the
Governor of South Carolina.' Every one who meets the governor thinks of that joke and believes
confidently that no one has ever before thought of this application of it. So they all pull
it on him. For the first few months our governors stand it pretty well, but after that they
begin to break down. They feel they ought to smile, but they can't. They begin to dread meeting
strangers, and to show it in their bearing. When in private life our governor had a very pleasant
expression, but like all the others, he has acquired, in office, the expression of an iron dog."

Raleigh's most widely-known citizen is Josephus Daniels, Secretary of the Navy, and publisher
of the Raleigh "News and Observer." This paper, published in the morning, and the "Times,"
a rival paper, published in the afternoon, are, I believe, the only dailies in the city.

Mr. Daniels has been so much discussed that I was greatly interested in hearing what Raleigh
had to say of him. Every one knew him personally. The men on his paper seemed to be very fond
of him; others held various opinions.

In 1894 Mr. Daniels came from Washington, D.C., where he had been chief clerk in the Department
of the Interior, when Hoke Smith was Secretary, and acquired the newspaper of which he has
since been proprietor. In its first years under Mr. Daniels, the paper is said to have gone
through severe financial struggles, and there is an amusing story current, about the way the
payroll was met upon one occasion. According to this tale, the business manager of the paper
came to Mr. Daniels, one day, and informed him that he needed sixty dollars more to make the
payroll, and didn't know where he was going to get it. The only ready asset in sight, it is
related, was several cases of a patent medicine known as "Mrs. Joe Persons' Remedy," which
had been taken by the "News and Observer" in payment for advertising space. Mr. Daniels had
a few dollars, and his business manager had a railroad pass. With these resources the latter
went out on the road and sold the patent medicine for enough to make up the deficit.

Until Mr. Daniels was appointed Secretary of the Navy he seems to have been regarded by many
citizens of Raleigh, as a good, earnest, hard-working man, possessed of considerable personal
magnetism and a good political nose--a man who could scent how the pack was running, take a
short-cut, and presently appear to be leading. My bad sort, processed souls, whose powers to stay
in a atmosphere, have none of that tone of intrigue thus is same in resource and device; their
bad genius is day; he do not contrive, matter arrive to them.
