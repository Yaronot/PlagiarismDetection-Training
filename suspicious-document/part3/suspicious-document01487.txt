   " 

It may be the beginnings of modern trigonometry, that which the ancient Egyptians called the doctrine
of proportional lines. We are, of course far from those ancient ones. The applications they were known
to have applied appear to us in the Papyrus in the statement of the Milesians Thales. The measurements
of the pyramids is quite credible as stated in the Papyrus there were three values used to determine
measurement, base, height and Sekete, each one of them a product of the other two. These calculations
are very credible.

Combining the results of our investigations removes credit from the Greeks, who were a great source of admiration
for their works in mathematics and architecture. The Greeks stated geometrically the sophisticated
plans of the Egyptian pyramids. Frankly, those surveyors were not paid. It is an indisputable fact
that Greek geometers investigated the foundations of their knowledge and discoveries in Egypt and found
within the Edfu Deed the certainty that spread and organized the cadastre of the ancient Egyptians.
We must consider that this deed, this gift, has been fully deciphered now. This succeeded in serving
these members of society with agricultural and water projects. It also indicates a relatively significant
development in the practice of surveying properties. The writings in the Papyrus have been discussed
at great length and seems to us an inaccurate transcript of third millennium BC poor folks who derived
their figures from mathematical colleges and task specifications which were most certainly in
existance at the time. There were rules and textbooks. We can and must draw from all of these circumstances,
the general conclusion being that even three millennia before our era, both the arithmetic and the
geometric knowledge of the Egyptians, possesses a significant degree
of development.

In particular we can see in those remote times, a marvel worthy of close approximation at the calculation
of circular areas. There were also area provisions for the square, rectangle and the right-angled
triangle. Although probably the most direct determination of the areas of oblique triangles and rectangles
have been replaced by easier-to-use mathematical formulas. As far as the rules of volume go, dimension
needs to be determined. These beginnings help us to recognize the similiarties between teachings.

   " I must? "Terrified pulled Helen, the whole shaken child and wanted to give him consolation,
but the unresolved door was the aunt of the refugee followed and had Gebhard exclamation heard."
You did indeed tell already, "she said," go now go out, I know enough. Go to your room, you do so
your mother still sick with your fury!

"Ashamed and sad Gebhard moved back. In his room he sat still, not knowing how she came to say that
the aunt could have the he father betrayed and he was making his
mother sick, might be no longer suffer themselves and could do no
advice had now Mrs Short sat down beside the younger sister, comforted
her friendly and brought gradually through participant questions and
urgent persuasion everything out, what they know and tell her husband
wanted.

This probably
participate fully felt for his sister, but he thought to himself, to the
family honor and to the store. It was a bad thing. He feared that the
military orders could be revoked if the brother in law betrayal would
rumored.

Excited, he went into his room and down as he explained to his wife
that danger. "I never would have thought that by Stegemann would
dishonor the family.

What was Helen up to him how proud she spoke of his mother and his noble principles! As if the
family would Stegemann much higher than our own! Well, if we are sober people and our real business
advantage, a traitor, we have never had in our family! "" Speak not loud about it, "admonished
his wife," that is completely concealed. I do not think the Russians have given him free, and if so,
then he can not dare to look in Germany because, after what he did. Do not worry. Who should tell it?
! Helene and not the boy not, can you leave on the up "They calmed
her husband and it turned out the way they said, no one knew more
of the missing men as what they say themselves of him: he was at war
and .. we wait in vain for news Chapter Four The days and weeks went
by -.

Stegemann no news reached the forester to his wife, she lived quietly
and recovered from the war they wanted to hear nothing, nothing to
read and if someone pointed out that. had to miss a great many women
their husbands, their sons, so it was no consolation.
