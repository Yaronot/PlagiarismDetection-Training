The following afternoon our train reached town and we joined it during the evening to be ready
for an early start for Golden City, the entrance to the mountains leading to Black Hawk and
Central City where our freight was consigned. The most hazardous part of our trip was before
us, one that to this day makes me shiver when I think of it. The first team entered the canyon
at 11 A. M. in a blinding snowstorm. The road for nearly the entire distance was hewn from
solid rock out of the side of steep mountains, gradually ascending to a great height, then
descending to what seemed a bottomless canyon. We finally arrived at Guy Hill, the most dangerous
part of the route. It took us one entire day to reach its pinnacle, where we camped for the
night. The road at the top was cut through solid rock at a height of twenty feet, seven feet
in width and led to a steep precipice. It then made a sharp turn to the right and, in a serpent
shape drive, continued to the canyon below. At this point it was said to be fifteen hundred
feet straight down, and a number of outfits had previously gone over its rocky edge and been
hurled to destruction by a slight error of judgment on the part of the driver.

The cold and snow, together with summer clothing, made our suffering indescribable. The following
morning I started in the lead of the train with a nine thousand pound boiler, with the rear
wheels securely locked, and twenty yoke of oxen to haul it to the edge of the precipice. Then
discarding all but the wheelers and leaders, we began the descent. There was not room enough
on either side for the driver to walk. He generally rode the off ox, but I took my position
on the rear of the wagon tongue and found it decidedly the safest place in case of an accident.
By night all wagons were safely in the canyon below. The road for nearly the entire distance
presented the same dangers, taking ten days to reach our destination from Denver, the entire
trip occupying eighty days.

A THRILLING COACH RIDE

On receiving our pay, which was our promised salary less twenty dollars for the Hostetter's
Bitters, my chum and myself decided to go direct to Denver, our friend remaining in the Mountain
City. They shook besides solicitous evenings saba, who recognized about two-fold the years were

wise tribes. During the descent
a slight error on the part of the horses or driver, would have hurled all to a horrible death;
but those mountain drivers, strapped to their seats, were monarchs of the Rockies and unerring
in every move. From among the snow-covered glaciers sparkling in the morning sun, emitting
the many tints of a midday storm-bow and presenting a sight of unsurpassed grandeur, we emerged
from the mouth of the last canyon and struck the smooth rolling trail. All the way from Golden
we were going, it seemed, on the wings of the wind and were landed in Denver on scheduled time.

CHAPTER IV

DENVER IN 1865

 In that period Denver was appropriately called the
"City of the Plains." Situated sixteen miles from the base of the
nearest Rocky Mountain peak, and six hundred and fifty miles from
Atchison, Kansas, the nearest town to the East; while seven hundred
miles to the west loomed up as from the very bowels of the earth, the
beautiful city of the Mormons, Salt Lake City, Utah. The nearest
forts--two hundred miles distant--were Fort Cottonwood to the
northeast, Collins to the north and Halleck to the northwest. Its
northern limits extended to the South fork of the Platte River; Cherry
Creek running through one-third, dividing it into East and West
Denver. Its population numbered about five thousand souls. Here was to
be found the illiterate man--but a grade above the coyote--lawbreakers
of every kind and from every land, to men of culture and refinement.
Here it stood, a typical mining town, a monument to the indomitable
energy of man in his efforts to settle that barren and almost endless
plain and open to the world the Rocky's unlimited hidden gold. Here
were brick structures modern for that day, the brick being made from
the soil of the territory; a United States mint, a church, a school
house, large warehouses, stores, and the home of the Rocky Mountain
Daily News, which kept one partially in touch with happenings in the
faraway states. Isolated from the outside world, it was an ideal place
of refuge for those anxious to escape the outraged law. Knights of the
green cloth held full sway. Men in every walk in life gambled. A dead
man for breakfast was not an uncommon heading for the menu card, the
old tree on the west bank of Cherry Creek furnishing the man. Society
was just a little exclusive and to gain admission the pass was, "Where
are you from?" and in some cases, "Your name in the East."

Desperadoes made one attempt to lay the city in ashes and certainly would have accomplished
their purpose had it not been for the timely action of the Vigilance Committee in hanging the
ring-leaders. When the guilt of a suspect for any crime was in doubt, he was presented with
a horse or mule and ordered to leave between sun and sun and never return. During my four years
of residence in Denver there was but one Indian scare and it made a lasting impression on the
tablet of my memory. A church bell pealed forth the warning over the thirsty desert of an Indian
attack. Business places were closed, the women and children were rushed to the mint and warehouses
for protection, armed men surrounded the city, pickets on horseback were thrown out in every
direction. Couriers kept thundering back and forth between picket line and those in command
and others were despatched to the different Forts for assistance that never came. A look of
determination stood out on the face of every one and not a man, from clergyman to desperado,
within the confines of the city who would not willingly have given up his life's blood to protect
the honor of the women and lives of the little ones. For three weary days and the same number
of nights the terrible suspense lasted, but no Indian came. It was a false alarm.

Denver, in its early settlement, was never attacked by the Indians except in isolated cases.
The only reason that I ever heard given for their not doing so was that they knew not their
strength, for there was no time in the sixties that they could not have swooped down on the
place, massacred all and buried the little mining town in ashes.

SECURED WORK AGAIN

For a young man to obtain work other than oxen or mule driving, we were told, was simply impossible.
Not being deterred, however, by this discouraging information we at once started out to secure
work. Board was twenty-five dollars a week in gold, and you had to furnish your own sleeping
quarters, so not to secure work at once would quickly reduce our wealth. We had called on nearly
all of the business places, when my chum secured a position with a grocer and freighter. As
for myself, I received little encouragement but finally called at a large restaurant where
I was offered work. I told the proprietor it was a little out of my line, but he told me that
if I could not find a position to suit me, I should walk in at any time, pull off my coat and
go to work, which I did three days later. About the tenth day the proprietor told me his lease
expired and that the man who owned the building was going to conduct the business. He came
in that afternoon, and I was introduced to him. Before leaving he stepped into the office and
informed me that he wanted a man next to him; or, in other words, an assistant and that the
former proprietor had given me a good recommend and he thought that I would suit him. He made
me a tempting offer and I accepted. The restaurant was located on Blake street, one of the
then principal business streets of the city, and kept open until early morning as did the gambling
places in the immediate vicinity. I soon discovered that the new proprietor could neither read
or write and that he conducted one of the largest private club rooms in the city where gambling
was carried on without limit. He paid me a large salary and allowed me everything my wild nature
craved. I had charge of the entire business as well as his bank account.

The restaurant was the headquarters of nearly all oxen and mule drivers and also of the miners
who came from the mountains in winter, and were of the toughest type of men of that day. All
professional oxen and mule drivers after making one round trip to the river and points in the
far Western territories were paid off in Denver and many of them would deposit with me, for
safe keeping, a large share of their dangerously and hard earned dollars. They would then start
out to do the town, now and then taking a chance at one of the many gambling games, always
returning for more money, which I would give them; and this they would continue until all was
expended except enough to keep them a week, when sober, and a commission for doing the business,
for which I was careful to look out. An individual who bore the name of "One Eye Jack" boarded
with us and I could always depend upon him in time of trouble. His vocation for a long time
was a mystery, until one evening, as I was passing down a side street, he popped out from an
alley and with uplifted blackjack would have felled and robbed me had he not recognized the
unearthly yell I gave. I forgave him, and afterwards he doubled his energies to protect me
and on more than one occasion saved my life. When in his professional clothes he was a tough
looking customer and could fight like a bull dog. He was always liberally supplied with someone
else's money. Yet with all his bad traits, his word was as good as his gold; but like other
similar individuals that infested Denver at that time, he finally went to the end of his tether,
and was presented by the Vigilance Committee with a hemp collar that deprived him of his life.

Before his demise, however, a party of ten tough-looking individuals entered the restaurant
and, in forceful language, demanded the best the country offered in eatables and drink. My
friend, or would-be-murderer, was in at the time and I noticed a look of cunning pleasure steal
over his rough countenance. The strangers were dressed in corduroy trousers, velveteen coats,
slouch hats and black ties. Their shirts and collars of red flannel made a conspicuous appearance
and caused their undoing later. After seeing them well cared for, I returned to the office
and calling Jack inquired his opinion of the gents.

"Well," he replied, "I may be mistaken but I will just bet you a ten spot they are road agents."
"Yes," I said, "I am inclined to agree with you, but keep mum."

You may think it strange I did not give this bold highwayman away; but life in those days was
sweet and I had no desire to have that young life taken so I followed Commanche Bill's advice
and strictly minded my own business. If I had not, I would not be living today.

HIGHWAYMEN OF THE WEST

Two mornings later on entering for breakfast one of the band had his head done up in a bandage.
From words he dropped I was satisfied that Jack or one of his cronies had been improving their
spare time by relieving him of his over abundance of gold. The reckless manner in which they
disposed of their money and their conversation when flushed with wine betrayed their true characters
and stamped them a murderous band of mountain highwaymen who had made their headquarters in
the fastnesses of the Rockies, near the overland mountain trail and there devoted their time
to holding up stage coaches, compelling the driver with a shot from a carbine to halt, descend,
disarm and be quiet. The passengers were then ordered to alight and stand in a row, continually
being covered with guns by a part of the band and by others relieved of their personal effects.
Then the stage coach was systematically gone through together with the Wells Fargo & Co's.
safe, which often contained gold into the thousands. These hold-ups were not infrequent and
were the fear of all who were obliged to pass through these canyons of robbery and often death.
The bunch that we harbored were undoubtedly as bold a band of robbers and murderers as ever
infested the silent caves of the Rockies. Could their dingy walls but talk they would reveal
crimes unspeakable. I knew there were many strangers in town and was almost certain their every
movement was watched; nor was I mistaken. The seventh day after their arrival a young school
teacher whom I knew by sight called at the restaurant and inquired by name for one of the band.
I asked if he knew him. He replied, no more than that he had met him in one of the corrals
of the city and had been offered free passage to the States if he would do their cooking. I
told him of my suspicions and all I knew about them and advised him not to go with them, but
like many others he gave no heed. Two days later they were missed at meal time. The next morning
word came by courier that the entire band including the school teacher were dangling by the
neck from the branches of cottonwood trees twelve miles down the Platte River with their pockets
inside-out and outfits gone. Thus was meted out innocent and guilty alike the Vigilance Committee
justice, which was not of uncommon occurrence.

Mr. Pembroke secured a position at Black Hawk, Colorado, in the year 1865, with the first smelter
works erected in the Rocky Mountains. Technology is not same for that one to be charming change, but

his employ I made the acquaintance of an ex-army officer, a graduate of West Point and a well
educated man, who afterwards became my boon companion. At that time he was an ex-pork merchant
from Cincinnati; an eccentric old fellow without chick or child, and with plenty of money to
loan at 3% a month. He owned a large warehouse on Cherry Creek in West Denver where he slept
and did his own cooking. His evenings were passed at the store and many were the nights that
we told stories and otherwise enjoyed ourselves. He was a silent member of the firm and I was
wise enough to keep on the right side of him. During that time the head of the firm ran for
Congress on the Democratic ticket. Such an election I never want to see or go through again.

and Andrew Johnson--then President of the United States--appointing the Democratic candidate
Governor of Colorado. A year from that time General Grant was inaugurated, and shortly afterwards
the Governor's head went into the basket and mine fell on the outside.

On another occasion there was to be a prize fight at Golden City, sixteen miles from Denver.
My friend, the ex-pork merchant, I could see was anxious to attend but did not wish to lower
his standard of dignity by doing so, so the subject was not mentioned save in a casual way
until the morning of the fight, when he entered the store, puffing and blowing, stamping the
floor with his hickory cane and mopping his crimson brow with an old-fashioned bandana handkerchief,
said "Charley, let's go to that infernal fight. I don't approve of it, but let's go."

"All right," I said. I was in for any kind of sport.
