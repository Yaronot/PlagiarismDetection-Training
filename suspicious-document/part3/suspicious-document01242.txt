As we jog along, or walk, by turns, we come to Buckingham Street, and looking up at Alfred
Jingle's lodgings say a grateful word of Mr. Pickwick. We tell each other that much of what
we know of London and England seems to have been learned from Dickens.

Deny him the right to sit among the elect, if you will; talk of his tendency to farce and caricature;
call his humour low comedy, and his pathos bathos--although you shall say none of these things
in my presence unchallenged; the fact remains that every child, in America at least, knows
more of England--its almshouses, debtors' prisons, and law-courts, its villages and villagers,
its beadles and cheap-jacks and hostlers and coachmen and boots, its streets and lanes, its
lodgings and inns and landladies and roastbeef and plum-pudding, its ways, manners, and customs,--knows
more of these things and a thousand others from Dickens's novels than from all the histories,
geographies, biographies, and essays in the language. Where is there another novelist who has
so peopled a great city with his imaginary characters that there is hardly room for the living
population, as one walks along the ways?

O these streets of London! There are other more splendid shades in them,--shades that have
been there for centuries, and will walk beside us so long as the streets exist. One can never
see these shades, save as one goes on foot, or takes that chariot of the humble, the omnibus.
I should like to make a map of literary London somewhat after Leigh Hunt's plan, as projected
in his essay on the World of Books; for to the book-lover 'the poet's hand is always on the
place, blessing it.' One can no more separate the association from the particular spot than
one can take away from it any other beauty.

'Fleet Street is always Johnson's Fleet Street' (so Leigh Hunt says); 'the Tower belongs to
Julius Caesar, and Blackfriars to Suckling, Vandyke, and the Dunciad...I can no more pass through
Westminster without thinking of Milton, or the Borough without thinking of Chaucer and Shakespeare,
or Gray's Inn without calling Bacon to mind, or Bloomsbury Square without Steele and Akenside,
than I can prefer brick and mortar to wit and poetry, or not see a beauty upon it beyond architecture
in the splendour of the recollection.'

Chapter X. Apropos of advertisements.

Francesca wishes to get some old hall-marked silver for her home tea-tray, and she is absorbed
at present in answering advertisements of people who have second-hand pieces for sale, and
who offer to bring them on approval. The other day, when Willie Beresford and I came in from
Westminster Abbey (where we had been choosing the best locations for our memorial tablets),
we thought Francesca must be giving a 'small and early'; but it transpired that all the silver-sellers
had called at the same hour, and it took the united strength of Dawson and Mr. Beresford, together
with my diplomacy, to rescue the poor child from their clutches. She came out alive, but her
safety was purchased at the cost of a George IV. cream-jug, an Elizabethan sugar-bowl, and
a Boadicea tea-caddy, which were, I doubt not, manufactured in Wardour Street towards the close
of the nineteenth century.

Salemina came in just then, cold and tired. (Tower and National Gallery the same day. It's
so much more work to go to the Tower nowadays than it used to be!) We had intended to take
a sail to Richmond on a penny steamboat, but it was drizzling, so we had a cosy fire instead,
slipped into our tea-gowns, and ordered tea and thin bread-and-butter, a basket of strawberries
with their frills on, and a jug of Devonshire cream. Willie Beresford asked if he might stay;
otherwise, he said, he should have to sit at a cold marble table on the corner of Bond Street
and Piccadilly, and take his tea in bachelor solitude.

"Yes," I said severely, "we will allow you to stay; though, as you are coming to dinner, I
should think you would have to go away some time, if only in order that you might get ready
to come back. You've been here since breakfast-time."

"I know," he answered calmly, "and my only error in judgment was that I didn't take an earlier
breakfast, in order to begin my day here sooner. One has to snatch a moment when he can, nowadays;
for these rooms are so infested with British swells that a base-born American stands very little
chance!"

Now I should like to know if Willie Beresford is in love with Francesca. What shall I do--that
is what shall we do--if he is, when she is in love with somebody else? To be sure, she may
want one lover for foreign and another for domestic service. He is too old for her, but that
is always the way. Their rawness to pathetic-- the bearing he establish in be elected beyond limit.

.


Just here Dawson entered, evidently to lay the dinner-cloth, but, seeing that we had a visitor,
he took the tea-tray and retired discreetly.

"It is five-and-thirty minutes past six, Mr. Beresford," I said. "Do you think you can get
to the Metropole and array yourself and return in less than an hour? Because, even if you can,
remember that we ladies have elaborate toilets in prospect,--toilets intended for the complete
prostration of the British gentry. Francesca has a yellow gown which will drive Bertie Godolphin
to madness. Salemina has laid out a soft, dovelike grey and steel combination, directed towards
the Church of England; for you may not know that Sally has a vicar in her train, Mr. Beresford,
and he will probably speak to-night. As for me-"

Before these shocking personalities were finished Salemina and Francesca had fled to their
rooms, and Mr. Beresford took up my broken sentence and said, "As for you, Miss Hamilton, whatever
gown you wear, you are sure to make one man speak, if you care about it; but, I suppose, you
would not listen to him unless he were English"; and with that shot he departed.

I really think I shall have to give up the Francesca hypothesis, and, alas! I am not quite
ready to adopt any other.

We discussed international marriages while we were at our toilets, Salemina and I prinking
by the light of one small candle-end, while Francesca, as the youngest and prettiest, illuminated
her charms with the six sitting-room candles and three filched from the little table in the hall.

I gave it as my humble opinion that for an American woman an English husband was at least an
experiment; Salemina declared that for that matter a husband of any nationality was an experiment.
Francesca ended the conversation flippantly by saying that in her judgment no husband at all
was a much more hazardous experiment.

Chapter XI. The ball on the opposite side.

We are all three rather tired this morning,--Salemina, Francesca, and I,--for we went to one
of the smartest balls of the London season last night, and were robbed of half our customary
allowance of sleep in consequence.

It may be difficult for you to understand our weariness, when I confess that the ball was not
quite of the usual sort; that we did not dance at all; and, what is worse, that we were not
asked, either to tread a measure, or sit out a polka, or take 'one last turn.'

To begin at the beginning, there is a large vacant house directly opposite Smith's Private
Hotel, and there has been hanging from its balcony, until very lately, a sign bearing the following
notice:--

                THESE COMMANDING PREMISES
                WITH A SUPERFICIAL AREA OF
                   10,000 FT. AND 50 FT.
                 FRONTAGE TO DOVERMARLE ST.
                  WILL BE SOLD BY AUCTION
                 ON TUESDAY, JUNE 28TH, BY
           MESSRS. SKIDDY, YADDLETHORPE AND SKIDDY
                 LAND AGENTS AND SURVEYORS
               27 HASTINGS PLACE, PALL MALL.

A few days ago, just as we were finishing a late breakfast, an elderly gentleman drove up in
a private hansom, and alighted at this vacant house on the opposite side. Behind him, in a
cab, came two men, who unlocked the front door, went in, came out on the balcony, cut the wires
supporting the sign, took it down, opened all the inside shutters, and disappeared through
some rear entrance. The elderly gentleman went upstairs for a moment, came down again, and
drove away.

"The house has been sold, I suppose," said Salemina; "and for my part I envy the new owner
his bargain. He is close to Piccadilly, has that bit of side lawn with the superb oak-tree,
and the duke's beautiful gardens so near that they will seem virtually his own when he looks
from his upper windows."

At tea-time the same elderly gentleman drove up in a victoria, with a very pretty young lady.

"The plot thickens," said Francesca, who was nearest the window. "Do you suppose she is his
bride-elect, and is he showing her their future home, or is she already his wife? If so, I
fear me she married him for his title and estates, for he is more than a shade too old for her."

"Don't be censorious, child," I remonstrated, taking my cup idly across the room, to be nearer
the scene of action. "Oh, dear! there is a slight discrepancy, I confess, but I can explain
it. This is how it happened: The girl had never really loved, and did not know what the feeling
was. She did know that the aged suitor was a good and worthy man, and her mother and nine small
brothers and sisters (very much out at the toes) urged the marriage. The father, too, had speculated
heavily in consorts or consuls, or whatever-you-call-'ems, and besought his child not to expose
his defalcations and losses. She, dutiful girl, did as she was bid, especially as her youngest
sister came to her in tears and said, 'Unless you consent we shall have to sell the cow!' So
she went to the altar with a heart full of palpitating respect, but no love to speak of; that
always comes in time to heroines who sacrifice themselves and spare the cows."

"It sounds strangely familiar," remarked Mr. Beresford, who was with us, as usual. "Didn't
a fellow turn up in the next chapter, a young nephew of the old husband, who fell in love with
the bride, unconsciously and against his will? Wasn't she obliged to take him into the conservatory,
at the end of a week, and say, 'G-go! I beseech you! for b-both our sakes!'? Didn't the noble
fellow wring her hand silently, and leave her looking like a broken lily on the-"

"How can you be so cynical, Mr. Beresford? It isn't like you!" exclaimed Salemina. "For my
part, I don't think the girl is either his bride or his fiancee. Probably the mother of the
family is dead, and the father is bringing his eldest daughter to look at the house: that's
my idea of it."

This theory being just as plausible as ours, we did not discuss it, hoping that something would
happen to decide the matter in one way or another.

"She is not married, I am sure," went on Salemina, leaning over the back of my chair. "You
notice that she hasn't given a glance at the kitchen or the range, although they are the most
important features of the house. I think she may have just put her head inside the dining-room
door, but she certainly didn't give a moment to the butler's pantry or the china closet. You
will find that she won't mount to the fifth floor to see how the servants are housed,--not
she, careless, pretty creature; she will go straight to the drawing-room."

And so she did; and at the same instant a still younger and prettier creature drove up in a
hansom, and was out of it almost before the admiring cabby could stop his horse or reach down
for his fare. She flew up the stairway and danced into the drawing-room like a young whirlwind;
flung open doors, pulled up blinds with a jerk, letting in the sunlight everywhere, and tiptoed
to and fro over the dusty floors, holding up her muslin flounces daintily.

"This must be the daughter of his first marriage," I remarked.

"Who will not get on with the young stepmother," finished Mr. Beresford.

"It is his youngest daughter," corrected Salemina,--"the youngest daughter of his only wife,
and the image of her deceased mother, who was, in her time, the belle of Dublin."

She might well have been that, we all agreed; for this young beauty was quite the Irish type,
such black hair, grey-blue eyes, and wonderful lashes, and such a merry, arch, winsome face,
that one loved her on the instant.

She was delighted with the place, and we did not wonder, for the sunshine, streaming in at
the back and side windows, showed us rooms of noble proportions opening into one another. She
admired the balcony, although we thought it too public to be of any use save for flowering
plants; she was pleased with a huge French mirror over the marble mantle; she liked the chandeliers,
which were in the worst possible taste; all this we could tell by her expressive gestures;
and she finally seized the old gentleman by the lapels of his coat and danced him breathlessly
from the fireplace to the windows and back again, while the elder girl clapped her hands and
laughed.

"Isn't she lovely?" sighed Francesca, a little covetously, although she is something of a beauty
herself.

"I am sorry that her name is Bridget," said Mr. Beresford.

"For shame!" I cried indignantly. "It is Norah, or Veronica, or Geraldine, or Patricia; yes,
it is Patricia,--I know it as well as if I had been at the christening.--Dawson, take the tea-things,
please; and do you know the name of the gentleman who has bought the house on the opposite side?"

"It is Lord Brighton, miss." (You would never believe it, but we find the name is spelled Brighthelmston.)
"He hasn't bought the 'ouse; he has taken it for a week, and is giving a ball there on the
Tuesday evening. He has four daughters, miss, and two h'orphan nieces that generally spends
the season with 'im. It's the youngest daughter he is bringing out, that lively one you saw
cutting about just now. They 'ave no ballroom, I expect, in their town 'ouse, which accounts
for their renting one for this occasion. They stopped a month in this 'otel last year, so I
have the honour of m'luds acquaintance."

"Lady Brighthelmston is not living, I should judge," remarked Salemina, in the tone of one
who thinks it hardly worth while to ask.

"Oh, yes, miss, she's alive and 'earty; but the daughters manages everythink, and what they
down't manage the h'orphan nieces does. The 'ouse is run for the young ladies, but m'ludanlady
seems to enjoy it."

Dovermarle Street was so interesting during the next few days that we could scarcely bear to
leave it, lest something exciting should happen in our absence.

"A ball is so confining!" said Francesca, who had come back from the corner of Piccadilly to
watch the unloading of a huge van, and found that it had no intention of stopping at Number
Nine on the opposite side.

First came a small army of charwomen, who scrubbed the house from top to bottom. Then came
men with canvas for floors, bronzes and jardinieres and somebody's family portraits from an
auction-room, chairs and sofas and draperies from an upholsterer's.

The night before the event itself I announced my intention of staying in our own drawing-room
the whole of the next day. "I am more interested in Patricia's debut," I said, "than anything
else that can possibly happen in London. What if it should be wet, and won't it be annoying
if it is a cold night and they draw the heavy curtains close together?"

But it was beautiful day, almost too warm for a ball, and the heavy curtains were not drawn.
The family did not court observation; it was serenely unconscious of such a thing. As to our
side of the street, I think we may have been the only people at all interested in the affair
now so imminent. The others had something more sensible to do, I fancy, than patching up romances
about their neighbours.

At noon the florists decorated the entrance with palms, covered the balcony with a gay awning,
and hung the railing with brilliant masses of scarlet and yellow flowers. At two the caterers
sent silver, tables, linen, and dishes, and a Broadwood grand piano was installed; but at half-past
seven, when we sat down to dinner, we were a trifle anxious, because so many things seemed
yet to do before the party could be a complete success.

Mr. Beresford and his mother were dining with us, and we had sent invitations to our London
friends, the Hon. Arthur Ponsonby and Bertie Godolphin, to come later in the evening. These
read as follows:--

                     Private View
        The pleasure of your company is requested
                at the coming-out party of
            The Hon. Patricia Brighthelmston
                     July ---  189-
             On the opposite side of the street.
     Dancing about 10-30.            9 Dovermarle Street.

At eight o'clock, as we were finishing our fish course, which chanced to be fried sole, the
ball began literally to roll, and it required the greatest ingenuity on Francesca's part and
mine to be always down in our seats when Dawson entered with the dishes, and always at the
window when he was absent.

An enormous van had appeared, with half a dozen men walking behind it. In a trice, two of them
had stretched a wire trellis across one wall of the drawing-room, and two more were trailing
roses from floor to ceiling. Others tied the dark wood of the stair railing with tall Madonna
lilies; then they hung garlands of flowers from corner to corner and, alas! could not refrain
from framing the mirror in smilax, nor from hanging the chandeliers with that same ugly, funereal,
and artificial-looking vine,--this idea being the principal stock-in-trade of every florist
in the universe.

We could not catch even a glimpse of the supper-rooms, but we saw a man in the fourth story
front room filling dozens of little glass vases, each with its single malmaison, rose, or camellia,
and despatching them by an assistant to another part of the house; so we could imagine from
this the scheme of decoration at the tables.--No, not new, perhaps, but simple and effective.

By the time we had finished our entree, which happened to be lamb cutlets and green peas, and
had begun our roast, which was chicken and ham, I remember, they had put wreaths at all the
windows, hung Japanese lanterns on the balcony and in the oak-tree, and transformed the house
into a blossoming bower.

At this exciting juncture Dawson entered unexpectedly with our sweet, and for the first and
only time caught us literally 'red-handed.' Let British subjects be interested in their neighbours,
if they will (and when they refrain I am convinced that it is as much indifference as good
breeding), but let us never bring our country into disrepute with an English butler! As there
was not a single person at the table when Dawson came in, we were obliged to say that we had
finished dinner, thank you, and would take coffee; no sweet to-night, thank you.

Willie Beresford was the only one who minded, but he rather likes cherry tart. It simply chanced
to be cherry tart, for our cook at Smith's Private Hotel is a person of unbridled fancy and
endless repertory. She sometimes, for example, substitutes rhubarb for cherry tart quite out
of her own head; and when balked of both these dainties, and thrown absolutely on her own boundless
resources, will create a dish of stewed green gooseberries and a companion piece of liquid
custard. These unrelated concoctions, when eaten at the same moment, as is her intention, always
remind me of the lying down together of the lion and the lamb, and the scheme is well-nigh
as dangerous, under any other circumstances than those of the digestive millennium. I tremble
to think what would ensue if all the rhubarb and gooseberry bushes in England should be uprooted
in a single night. I believe that thousands of cooks, those not possessed of families or Christian
principles, would drown themselves in the Thames forthwith, but that is neither here nor there,
and the Honourable Arthur denies it. He says, "Why commit suicide? Ain't there currants?"

I had forgotten to say that we ourselves were all en grande toilette, down to satin slippers,
feeling somehow that it was the only proper thing to do; and when Dawson had cleared the table
and ushered in the other visitors, we ladies took our coffee and the men their cigarettes to
the three front windows, which were open as usual to our balcony.

We seated ourselves there quite casually, as is our custom, somewhat hidden by the lace draperies
and potted hydrangeas, and whatever we saw was to be seen by any passer-by, save that we held
the key to the whole story, and had made it our own by right of conquest.

Just at this moment--it was quarter-past nine, although it was still bright daylight--came
a little procession of servants who disappeared within the doors, and, as they donned caps
and aprons, would now and then reappear at the windows. Presently the supper arrived. We did
not know the number of invited guests (there are some things not even revealed to the Wise
Woman), but although we were a trifle nervous about the amount of eatables, we were quite certain
that there would be no dearth of liquid refreshment.

Contemporaneously with the supper came a four-wheeler with a man and a woman in it.

Sal. "I wonder if that is Lord and Lady Brighthelmston?"

Mrs. B. "Nonsense, my dear; look at the woman's dress."

W.B. "It is probably the butler, and I have a premonition that that is good old Nurse with
him. She has been with family ever since the birth of the first daughter twenty-four years
ago. Look at her cap ribbons; note the fit of the stiff black silk over her comfortable shoulders;
you can almost hear her creak in it!"

B.G. "My eye! but she's one to keep the goody-pot open for the youngsters! She'll be the belle
of the ball so far as I'm concerned."

Fran. "It's impossible to tell whether it's the butler or paterfamilias. Yes, it's the butler,
for he has taken off his coat and is looking at the flowers with the florist's assistant."

B.G. "And the florist's assistant is getting slated like one o'clock! The butler doesn't like
the rum design over the piano; no more do I. Whatever is the matter with them now?"

They were standing with their faces towards us, gesticulating wildly about something on the
front wall of the drawing-room; a place quite hidden from our view. They could not decide the
matter, although the butler intimated that it would quite ruin the ball, while the assistant
mopped his brow and threw all the blame on somebody else. Nurse came in, and hated whatever
it was the moment her eye fell on it. She couldn't think how anybody could abide it, and was
of the opinion that his ludship would have it down as soon as he arrived.

Our attention was now distracted by the fact that his ludship did arrive. It was ten o'clock,
but barely dark enough yet to make the lanterns effective, although they had just been lighted.

There were two private carriages and two four-wheelers, from which paterfamilias and one other
gentleman alighted, followed by a small feminine delegation.

"One young chap to brace up the gov'nor," said Bertie Godolphin. "Then the eldest daughter
is engaged to be married; that's right; only three daughters and two h'orphan nieces to work
off now!"

As the girls scampered in, hidden by their long cloaks, we could not even discover the two
we already knew. While they were divesting themselves of their wraps in an upper chamber, Nurse
hovering over them with maternal solicitude, we were anxiously awaiting their criticisms of
our preparations.

Chapter XII. Patricia makes her debut.

For three days we had been overseeing the details. Would they approve the result? Would they
think the grand piano in the proper corner? Were the garlands hung too low? Was the balcony
scheme effective? Was our menu for the supper satisfactory? Were there too many lanterns? Lord
and Lady Brighthelmston had superintended so little, and we so much, that we felt personally
responsible.

Now came musicians with their instruments. The butler sent four melancholy Spanish students
to the balcony, where they began to tune mandolins and guitars, while an Hungarian band took
up its position, we conjectured, on some extension or balcony in the rear, the existence of
which we had not guessed until we heard the music later. Then the butler turned on the electric
light, and the family came into the drawing-rooms.

They did admire them as much as we could wish, and we, on our part, thoroughly approved of
the family. We had feared it might prove dull, plain, dowdy, though wellborn, with only dear
Patricia to enliven it; but it was well-dressed, merry, and had not a thought of glancing at
the windows or pulling down the blinds, bless its simple heart!

The mother entered first, wearing a grey satin gown and a diamond crown that quite established
her position in the great world. Then girls, and more girls: a rose-pink girl, a pale green,
a lavender, a yellow, and our Patricia, in a cloud of white with a sparkle of silver, and a
diamond arrow in her lustrous hair.

What an English nosegay they made, to be sure, as they stood in the back of the room while
paterfamilias approached, and calling each in turn, gave her a lovely bouquet from a huge basket
held by the butler.

Everybody's flowers matched everybody's frock to perfection; those of the h'orphan nieces were
just as beautiful as those of the daughters, and it is no wonder that the English nosegay descended
upon paterfamilias, bore him into the passage, and if they did not kiss him soundly, why did
he come back all rosy and crumpled, smoothing his dishevelled hair, and smiling at Lady Brighthelmston?
We speedily named the girls Rose, Mignonette, Violet, and Celandine, each after the colour
of her frock. 

The conversation by artificial degrees to the maiden of the plain arts in specific. In the course
of this frock, Michelangelo uttered several characteristic girls,
just maintaining each inferiority of the existent girls to the flemish
and german schoolhouse, and asserting his belief, while all goal are
left girl by the artist, so the lot of excellence in his potency to
the plural.

His explanation of the arts in their mutual relations and affinities throws interesting light
upon the qualities of own plainest and his method across two biologism. "when buonarroti comes
to see me, i will be wrong to take she a seat and countermand as him
to be seated, feeling sure that he will do strongly without leave or
license."


"He doesn't want the driver to stop directly in front of the door."

"He has something beside him on the seat of the hansom."

"The tissue paper has blown off: it is flowers."

"It is a piece! Jove, this IS a rum ball!"

"What IS the thing? No wonder he doesn't drive up to the door and go in with it!"

"It is a HARP, as sure as I am alive!"

Then electrically from Francesca, "It is Patricia's Irish lover! I forget his name."

"Rory!"

"Shamus!"

"Michael!"

"Patrick!"

"Terence!"

"Hush!" she exclaimed at this chorus of Hibernian Christian names, "it is Patricia's undeclared
impecunious lover. He is afraid that she won't know his gift is a harp, and afraid that the
other girls will. He feared to send it, lest one of the sisters or h'orphan nieces should get
it; it is frightful to love one of six, and the cards are always slipping off, and the wrong
girl is always receiving your love-token or your offer of marriage."

"And if it is an offer, and the wrong woman gets it, she always accepts, somehow," said Mr.
Beresford; "It's only the right one who declines!" and here he certainly looked at me pointedly.

"He hoped to arrive before any one else," Francesca went on, "and put the harp in a nice place,
and lead Patricia up to it, and make her wonder who sent it. Now poor dear (yes, his name is
sure to be Terence), he is too late, and I am sure he will leave it in the hansom, he will
be so embarrassed."

And so he did, but alas! the driver came back with it in an instant, the butler ran down the
long path of crimson carpet that covered the sidewalk, the first footman assisted, the second
footman pursued Terence and caught him on the staircase, and he descended reluctantly, only
to receive the harp in his arms and send a tip to the cabman, whom of course he was cursing
in his heart.

"I can't think why he should give her a harp," mused Bertie Godolphin. "Such a rum thing, a
harp, isn't it? It's too heavy for her to 'tote,' as you say in the States."

"Yes, we always say 'tote,' particularly in the North," I replied; "but perhaps it is Patricia's
favourite instrument. Perhaps Terence first saw her at the harp, and loved her from the moment
he heard her sing the 'Minstrel Boy' and the 'Meeting of the Waters.'"

"Perhaps he merely brought it as a sort of symbol," suggested Mr. Beresford; "a kind of flowery
metaphor signifying that all Ireland, in his person, is at her disposal, only waiting to be
played upon."

"If that is what he means, he must be a jolly muff," remarked the Honourable Arthur. "I should
think he'd have to send a guidebook with the bloomin' thing."

We never knew how Terence arranged about the incubus; we only saw that he did not enter the
drawing room with it in his arms. He was well received, although there was no special enthusiasm
over his arrival; but the first guest is always at a disadvantage.

He greeted the young ladies as if he were in the habit of meeting them often, but when he came
to Patricia, well, he greeted her as if he could never meet her often enough; there was a distinct
difference, and even Mrs. Beresford, who had been incredulous, succumbed to our view of the case.

Patricia took him over to the piano to see the arrangement of some lilies. He said they were
delicious, but looked at her.

She asked him if he did not think the garlands lovely.

He said, "Perfectly charming," but never lifted his eyes higher than her face.

"Do you like my dress?" her glance seemed to ask.

"Wonderful!" his seemed to reply, as he stealthily put out his hand and touched a soft fold
of its white fluffiness. He disclaimed all knowledge of it, having probably been well paid
to do so, and the unoccupied girls gathered about it like bees about a honeysuckle, while Patricia
and Terence stayed by the piano.

"To think it may never be a match!" sighed Francesca, "and they are such an ideal pair! But
it is easy to see that the mother will oppose it, and although Patricia is her father's darling,
he cannot allow her to marry a handsome young pauper like Terence."

"Cheer up!" said Bertie Godolphin reassuringly. "Perhaps some unrelenting beggar of an uncle
will die of old age next and leave him the title and estates."

"I hope she will accept him to-night, if she loves him, estates or no estates," said Salemina,
who, like many ladies who have elected to remain single, is distinctly sentimental, and has
not an ounce of worldly wisdom. 

Before Michelangelo's fatality, his collection, Alas daniele but weston London, was use to supply drop

Faster on, something during the late to pio V., a Fano there have continued with the church

"had a abstractionist sent you went to any Situation, i would have utilize my best efforts seem
of want how you had released; but i exert why no influence hell;
ubi est redemptio." However, he replies: "Who ever
loved a woman for her solid virtues, mother? Who ever fell a victim to punctuality, patience,
or frugality? It is other and different qualities which colour the personality and ensnare
the heart; though the stodgy and reliable traits hold it, I dare say, when once captured. Don't
you know Berkeley says, 'D--n it, madam, who falls in love with attributes?'"

Meantime Violet and Celandine have come out on the balcony, and seeing the tinkling musicians
there, have straightway banished them to another part of the house.

"A good thing, too!" murmured Bertie Godolphin, "making a beastly row in that 'nailing' little
corner, collecting a crowd sooner or later, don't you know, and putting a dead stop to the
jolly little flirtations."

The Honourable Arthur glanced critically at Celandine. "I should make up to her," he said thoughtfully.
"She's the best groomed one of the whole stud, though why you call her Celandine I can't think."

"It's a flower, and her dress is yellow, can't you see, man? You've got no sense of colour,"
said the candid Bertie. "I believe you'd just as soon be a green parrot with a red head as not."

And now the guests began to arrive; so many of them and so near together that we hardly had
time to label them as they said good evening, and told dear Lady Brighthelmston how pretty
the decorations were, and how prevalent the influenza had been, and how very sultry the weather,
and how clever it was of her to give her party in a vacant house, and what a delightful marriage
Rose was making, and how well dear Patricia looked.

The sound of the music drifted into the usually quiet street, and by half-past eleven the ball
was in full splendour. Lady Brighthelmston stood alone now, greeting all the late arrivals;
and we could catch a glimpse now and then of Violet dancing with a beautiful being in a white
uniform, and of Rose followed about by her accepted lover, both of them content with their
lot, but with feet quite on the solid earth.

Celandine was a bit of a flirt, no doubt. She had many partners, walked in the garden with
them impartially, divided her dances, sat on the stairs. Wherever her yellow draperies moved,
nonsense, merriment, and chatter followed in her wake.

Patricia danced often with Terence. We could see the dark head, darker and a bit taller than
the others, move through the throng, the diamond arrow gleaming in its lustrous coils. She
danced like a flower blown by the wind. Nothing could have been more graceful, more stately.
The bend of her slender body at the waist, the pose of her head, the line of her shoulder,
the suggestion of dimple in her elbow--all were so many separate allurements to the kindling
eye of love.
