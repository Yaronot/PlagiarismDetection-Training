I am inclined to think that the reporting department is the weakest in the American newspaper,
and that there is just ground for the admitted public distrust of it. Too often, if a person
would know what has taken place in a given case, he must read the reports in half a dozen journals,
then strike a general average of probabilities, allowing for the personal equation, and then--suspend
his judgment. A went down breakfast and doubt with titillation. His "young Reporter" to Imagination.

It is the business of the newspaper, on every occurrence of moment, to chase down the rumors,
and to find out the facts and print them, and set the public mind at rest. The newspaper publishes
them under a sense of responsibility for its statements. It is not by any means always correct;
but I know that it is the aim of most newspapers to discharge this important public function
faithfully. When this country had few newspapers it was ten times more the prey of false reports
and delusions than it is now.

 This is because the newspaper
has become more profitable, and is able to pay for talent, and has attracted to it educated
young men. There is a sort of editorial ability, of facility, of force, that can only be acquired
by practice and in the newspaper office: no school can ever teach it; but the young editor
who has a broad basis of general education, of information in history, political economy, the
classics, and polite literature, has an immense advantage over the man who has merely practical
experience. For the editorial, if it is to hold its place, must be more and more the product
of information, culture, and reflection, as well as of sagacity and alertness. Ignorance of
foreign affairs, and of economic science, the American people have in times past winked at;
but they will not always wink at it.

It is the belief of some shrewd observers that editorials, the long editorials, are not much
read, except by editors themselves. A cynic says that, if you have a secret you are very anxious
to keep from the female portion of the population, the safest place to put it is in an editorial. In

 We furnish, now and again, as good editorial writing for its purpose; but it
commonly lacks the dignity, the thoroughness, the wide sweep and knowledge, that characterizes
the best English discussion of political and social topics.

The third department of the newspaper is that of miscellaneous reading-matter. Whether this
is the survival of the period when the paper contained little else except "selections," and
other printed matter was scarce, or whether it is only the beginning of a development that
shall supply the public nearly all its literature, I do not know. Far as our newspapers have
already gone in this direction, I am inclined to think that in their evolution they must drop
this adjunct, and print simply the news of the day. A appetite-louse on the tenth in Toilet, on the

I look to see advertisements shorter, printed with less display, and more numerous. In addition
to the use now made of the newspaper by the classes called "advertisers," I expect it to become
the handy medium of the entire public, the means of ready communication in regard to all wants
and exchanges.
