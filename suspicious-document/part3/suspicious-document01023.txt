[Note 3: The nitric acid, after attaining a moderate strength, oxidizes the Fe^{++} ions to
Fe^{+++} ions with the formation of an intermediate nitroso-compound similar in character to
that formed in the "ring-test" for nitrates. The nitric oxide is driven out by heat, and the
solution then shows by its color the presence of ferric compounds. A drop of the oxidized solution
should be tested on a watch-glass with potassium ferricyanide, to insure a complete oxidation.
This oxidation of the iron is necessary, since Fe^{++} ions are not completely precipitated
by ammonia.

The ionic changes which are involved in this oxidation are perhaps most simply expressed by
the equation

3Fe^{++} + NO{3}^{-}+ 4H^{+} --> 3Fe^{+++} + 2H{2}O + NO,

the H^{+} ions coming from the acid in the solution, in this case either the nitric or the
hydrochloric acid. The full equation on which this is based may be written thus:

6FeSO{4} + 2HNO{3} + 6HCl --> 2Fe{2}(SO{4}){3} + 2FeCl{3} + 2NO + 4H{2}O,

assuming that only enough nitric acid is added to complete the oxidation.]

[Note 4: The ferric hydroxide precipitate tends to carry down some sulphuric acid in the form
of basic ferric sulphate. This tendency is lessened if the solution of the iron is added to
an excess of OH^{-} ions from the ammonium hydroxide, since under these conditions immediate
and complete precipitation of the ferric hydroxide ensues. A gradual neutralization with ammonia
would result in the local formation of a neutral solution within the liquid, and subsequent
deposition of a basic sulphate as a consequence of a local deficiency of OH^{-} ions from the
NH{4}OH and a partial hydrolysis of the ferric salt. Even with this precaution the entire absence
of sulphates from the first iron precipitate is not assured. It is, therefore, redissolved
and again thrown down by ammonia. The organic matter of the filter paper may occasion a partial
reduction of the iron during solution, with consequent possibility of incomplete subsequent
precipitation with ammonia. The nitric acid is added to reoxidize this iron.

To avoid errors arising from the solvent action of ammoniacal liquids upon glass, the iron
precipitate should be filtered without unnecessary delay.]

[Note 5: The washings from the ferric hydroxide are acidified with nitric acid, before testing
with silver nitrate, to destroy the ammonia which is a solvent of silver chloride.

The use of suction to promote filtration and washing is permissible, though not prescribed.
The precipitate should not be allowed to dry during the washing.]

!Ignition of the Iron Precipitate!

Heat a platinum or porcelain crucible, cool it in a desiccator and weigh, repeating until a
constant weight is obtained.

Fold the top of the filter paper over the moist precipitate of ferric hydroxide and transfer
it cautiously to the crucible. Wipe the inside of the funnel with a small fragment of washed
filter paper, if necessary, and place the paper in the crucible.

Incline the crucible on its side, on a triangle supported on a ring-stand, and stand the cover
on edge at the mouth of the crucible. Place a burner below the front edge of the crucible,
using a low flame and protecting it from drafts of air by means of a chimney. The heat from
the burner is thus reflected into the crucible and dries the precipitate without danger of
loss as the result of a sudden generation of steam within the mass of ferric hydroxide. As
the drying progresses the burner may be gradually moved toward the base of the crucible and
the flame increased until the paper of the filter begins to char and finally to smoke, as the
volatile matter is expelled. This is known as "smoking off" a filter, and the temperature should
not be raised sufficiently high during this process to cause the paper to ignite, as the air
currents produced by the flame of the blazing paper may carry away particles of the precipitate.

When the paper is fully charred, move the burner to the base of the crucible and raise the
temperature to the full heat of the burner for fifteen minutes, with the crucible still inclined
on its side, but without the cover (Note 1). Finally set the crucible upright in the triangle,
cover it, and heat at the full temperature of a blast lamp or other high temperature burner.
Cool and weigh in the usual manner (Note 2). Repeat the strong heating until the weight is
constant within 0.0003 gram.

From the weight of ferric oxide (Fe{2}O{3}) calculate the percentage of iron (Fe) in the sample
(Note 3).

[Note 1: These directions for the ignition of the precipitate must be closely followed. A ready
access of atmospheric oxygen is of special importance to insure the reoxidation to ferric oxide
of any iron which may be reduced to magnetic oxide (Fe{3}O{4}) during the combustion of the
filter. The final heating over the blast lamp is essential for the complete expulsion of the
last traces of water from the hydroxide.]

[Note 2: Ignited ferric oxide is somewhat hygroscopic. On this account the weighings must be
promptly completed after removal from the desiccator. In all weighings after the first it is
well to place the weights upon the balance-pan before removing the crucible from the desiccator.
It is then only necessary to move the rider to obtain the weight.]

[Note 3: The gravimetric determination of aluminium or chromium is comparable with that of
iron just described, with the additional precaution that the solution must be boiled until
it contains but a very slight excess of ammonia, since the hydroxides of aluminium and chromium
are more soluble than ferric hydroxide.

The most important properties of these hydroxides, from a quantitative standpoint, other than
those mentioned, are the following: All are precipitable by the hydroxides of sodium and potassium,
but always inclose some of the precipitant, and should be reprecipitated with ammonium hydroxide
before ignition to oxides. Chromium and aluminium hydroxides dissolve in an excess of the caustic
alkalies and form anions, probably of the formula AlO2^{-} and CrO{2}^{-}. Chromium hydroxide
is reprecipitated from this solution on boiling. When first precipitated the hydroxides are
all readily soluble in acids, but aluminium hydroxide dissolves with considerable difficulty
after standing or boiling for some time. The precipitation of the hydroxides is promoted by
the presence of ammonium chloride, but is partially or entirely prevented by the presence of
tartaric or citric acids, glycerine, sugars, and some other forms of soluble organic matter.
The hydroxides yield on ignition an oxide suitable for weighing (Al{2}O{3}, Cr{2}O{3}, Fe{2}O{3}).]

DETERMINATION OF SULPHUR

PROCEDURE.--Add to the combined filtrates from the ferric hydroxide about 0.6 gram of anhydrous
sodium carbonate; cover the beaker, and then add dilute hydrochloric acid (sp. gr. 1.12) in
moderate excess and evaporate to dryness on the water bath. Add 10 cc. of concentrated hydrochloric
acid (sp. gr. 1.20) to the residue, and again evaporate to dryness on the bath. Dissolve the
residue in water, filter if not clear, transfer to a 700 cc. beaker, dilute to about 400 cc.,
and cautiously add hydrochloric acid until the solution shows a distinctly acid reaction (Note
1). Heat the solution to boiling, and add !very slowly! and with constant stirring, 20 cc.
in excess of the calculated amount of a hot barium chloride solution, containing about 20 grams
BaCl{2}.2H{2}O per liter (Notes 2 and 3). Continue the boiling for about two minutes, allow
the precipitate to settle, and decant the liquid at the end of half an hour (Note 4). Replace
the beaker containing the original filtrate by a clean beaker, wash the precipitated sulphate
by decantation with hot water, and subsequently upon the filter until it is freed from chlorides,
testing the washings as described in the determination of iron. The filter is then transferred
to a platinum or porcelain crucible and ignited, as described above, until the weight is constant
(Note 5). From the weight of barium sulphate (BaSO{4}) obtained, calculate the percentage of
sulphur (S) in the sample.

[Note 1: Barium sulphate is slightly soluble in hydrochloric acid, even dilute, probably as
a result of the reduction in the degree of dissociation of sulphuric acid in the presence of
the H^{+} ions of the hydrochloric acid, and possibly because of the formation of a complex
anion made up of barium and chlorine; hence only the smallest excess should be added over the
amount required to acidify the solution.]

[Note 2: The ionic changes involved in the precipitation of barium sulphate are very simple:

Ba^{++} + SO{4}^{--} --> [BaSO{4}]

This case affords one of the best illustrations of the effect of an excess of a precipitant
in decreasing the solubility of a precipitate. If the conditions are considered which exist
at the moment when just enough of the Ba^{++} ions have been added to correspond to the SO{4}^{--}
ions in the solution, it will be seen that nearly all of the barium sulphate has been precipitated,
and that the small amount which then remains in the solution which is in contact with the precipitate
must represent a saturated solution for the existing temperature, and that this solution is
comparable with a solution of sugar to which more sugar has been added than will dissolve.
It should be borne in mind that the quantity of barium sulphate in this !saturated solution
is a constant quantity! for the existing conditions. The dissolved barium sulphate, like any
electrolyte, is dissociated, and the equilibrium conditions may be expressed thus:

(!Conc'n Ba^{++} x Conc'n SO{4}^{--})/(Conc'n BaSO{4}) = Const.!,

and since !Conc'n BaSO{4}! for the saturated solution has a constant value (which is very small),
it may be eliminated, when the expression becomes !Conc'n Ba^{++} x Conc'n SO{4}^{--} = Const.!,
which is the "solubility product" of BaSO{4}. If, now, an excess of the precipitant, a soluble
barium salt, is added in the form of a relatively concentrated solution (the slight change
of volume of a few cubic centimeters may be disregarded for the present discussion) the concentration
of the Ba^{++} ions is much increased, and as a consequence the !Conc'n SO{4}! must decrease
in proportion if the value of the expression is to remain constant, which is a requisite condition
if the law of mass action upon which our argument depends holds true. In other words, SO{4}^{--}
ions must combine with some of the added Ba^{++} ions to form [BaSO{4}]; but it will be recalled
that the solution is already saturated with BaSO{4}, and this freshly formed quantity must,
therefore, separate and add itself to the precipitate. This is exactly what is desired in order
to insure more complete precipitation and greater accuracy, and leads to the conclusion that
the larger the excess of the precipitant added the more successful the analysis; but a practical
limit is placed upon the quantity of the precipitant which may be properly added by other conditions,
as stated in the following note.]

[Note 3: Barium sulphate, in a larger measure than most compounds, tends to carry down other
substances which are present in the solution from which it separates, even when these other
substances are relatively soluble, and including the barium chloride used as the precipitant.
This is also notably true in the case of nitrates and chlorates of the alkalies, and of ferric
compounds; and, since in this analysis ammonium nitrate has resulted from the neutralization
of the excess of the nitric acid added to oxidize the iron, it is essential that this should
be destroyed by repeated evaporation with a relatively large quantity of hydrochloric acid.
During evaporation a mutual decomposition of the two acids takes place, and the nitric acid
is finally decomposed and expelled by the excess of hydrochloric acid.

Iron is usually found in the precipitate of barium sulphate when thrown down from hot solutions
in the presence of ferric salts. This, according to Kuster and Thiel (!Zeit. anorg. Chem.!,
22, 424), is due to the formation of a complex ion (Fe(SO{4}){2}) which precipitates with the
Ba^{++} ion, while Richards (!Zeit. anorg. Chem.!, 23, 383) ascribes it to hydrolytic action,
which causes the formation of a basic ferric complex which is occluded in the barium precipitate.
Whatever the character of the compound may be, it has been shown that it loses sulphuric anhydride
upon ignition, causing low results, even though the precipitate contains iron.

The contamination of the barium sulphate by iron is much less in the presence of ferrous than
ferric salts. If, therefore, the sulphur alone were to be determined in the ferrous ammonium
sulphate, the precipitation by barium might be made directly from an aqueous solution of the
salt, which had been made slightly acid with hydrochloric acid.]

[Note 4: The precipitation of the barium sulphate is probably complete at the end of a half-hour,
and the solution may safely be filtered at the expiration of that time if it is desired to
hasten the analysis.

As already noted, many precipitates of the general character of this sulphate tend to grow
more coarsely granular if digested for some time with the liquid from which they have separated.
It is therefore well to allow the precipitate to stand in a warm place for several hours, if
practicable, to promote ease of filtration. The filtrate and washings should always be carefully
examined for minute quantities of the sulphate which may pass through the pores of the filter.
This is best accomplished by imparting to the filtrate a gentle rotary motion, when the sulphate,
if present, will collect at the center of the bottom of the beaker.]

[Note 5: A reduction of barium sulphate to the sulphide may very readily be caused by the reducing
action of the burning carbon of the filter, and much care should be taken to prevent any considerable
reduction from this cause. Subsequent ignition, with ready access of air, reconverts the sulphide
to sulphate unless a considerable reduction has occurred. In the latter case it is expedient
to add one or two drops of sulphuric acid and to heat cautiously until the excess of acid is
expelled.]

[Note 6: Barium sulphate requires about 400,000 parts of water for its solution. It is not
decomposed at a red heat but suffers loss, probably of sulphur trioxide, at a temperature above
900°C.]

DETERMINATION OF SULPHUR IN BARIUM SULPHATE

PROCEDURE.--Weigh out, into platinum crucibles, two portions of about 0.5 gram of the sulphate.
Mix each in the crucible with five to six times its weight of anhydrous sodium carbonate. This
can best be done by placing the crucible on a piece of glazed paper and stirring the mixture
with a clean, dry stirring-rod, which may finally be wiped off with a small fragment of filter
paper, the latter being placed in the crucible. Cover the crucible and heat until a quiet,
liquid fusion ensues. Remove the burner, and tip the crucible until the fused mass flows nearly
to its mouth. Hold it in that position until the mass has solidified. When cold, the material
may usually be detached in a lump by tapping the crucible or gently pressing it near its upper
edge. If it still adheres, a cubic centimeter or so of water may be placed in the cold crucible
and cautiously brought to boiling, when the cake will become loosened and may be removed and
placed in about 250 cc. of hot, distilled water to dissolve. Clean the crucible completely,
rubbing the sides with a rubber-covered stirring-rod, if need be.

When the fused mass has completely disintegrated and nothing further will dissolve, decant
the solution from the residue of barium carbonate (Note 1). Pour over the residue 20 cc. of
a solution of sodium carbonate and 10 cc. of water and heat to gentle boiling for about three
minutes (Note 2). Filter off the carbonate and wash it with hot water, testing the slightly
acidified washings for sulphate and preserving any precipitates which appear in these tests.
Acidify the filtrate with hydrochloric acid until just acid, bring to boiling, and slowly add
hot barium chloride solution, as in the preceding determination. Add also any tests from the
washings in which precipitates have appeared. Filter, wash, ignite, and weigh.

From the weight of barium sulphate, calculate the percentage of sulphur (S) in the sample.

[Note 1: This alkaline fusion is much employed to disintegrate substances ordinarily insoluble
in acids into two components, one of which is water soluble and the other acid soluble. The
reaction involved is:

BaSO{4} + Na{2}CO{3}, --> BaCO{3}, + Na{2}SO{4}.

As the sodium sulphate is soluble in water, and the barium carbonate insoluble, a separation
between them is possible and the sulphur can be determined in the water-soluble portion.

It should be noted that this method can be applied to the purification of a precipitate of
barium sulphate if contaminated by most of the substances mentioned in Note 3 on page 114.
The impurities pass into the water solution together with the sodium sulphate, but, being present
in such minute amounts, do not again precipitate with the barium sulphate.]

[Note 2: The barium carbonate is boiled with sodium carbonate solution before filtration because
the reaction above is reversible; and it is only by keeping the sodium carbonate present in
excess until nearly all of the sodium sulphate solution has been removed by filtration that
the reversion of some of the barium carbonate to barium sulphate is prevented. This is an application
of the principle of mass action, in which the concentration of the reagent (the carbonate ion)
is kept as high as practicable and that of the sulphate ion as low as possible, in order to
force the reaction in the desired direction (see Appendix).]

DETERMINATION OF PHOSPHORIC ANHYDRIDE IN APATITE

The mineral apatite is composed of calcium phosphate, associated with calcium chloride, or
fluoride. Specimens are easily obtainable which are nearly pure and leave on treatment with
acid only a slight siliceous residue.

For the purpose of gravimetric determination, phosphoric acid is usually precipitated from
ammoniacal solutions in the form of magnesium ammonium phosphate which, on ignition, is converted
into magnesium pyrophosphate. Since the calcium phosphate of the apatite is also insoluble
in ammoniacal solutions, this procedure cannot be applied directly. The separation of the phosphoric
acid from the calcium must first be accomplished by precipitation in the form of ammonium phosphomolybdate
in nitric acid solution, using ammonium molybdate as the precipitant. The "yellow precipitate,"
as it is often called, is not always of a definite composition, and therefore not suitable
for direct weighing, but may be dissolved in ammonia, and the phosphoric acid thrown out as
magnesium ammonium phosphate from the solution.

Of the substances likely to occur in apatite, silicic acid alone interferes with the precipitation
of the phosphoric acid in nitric acid solution.

PRECIPITATION OF AMMONIUM PHOSPHOMOLYBDATE

PROCEDURE.--Grind the mineral in an agate mortar until no grit is perceptible. Transfer the
substance to a weighing-tube, and weigh out two portions, not exceeding 0.20 gram each (Note
1) into two beakers of about 200 cc. capacity. Pour over them 20 cc. of dilute nitric acid
(sp. gr. 1.2) and warm gently until solvent action has apparently ceased. Evaporate the solution
cautiously to dryness, heat the residue for about an hour at 100-110°C., and treat it again
with nitric acid as described above; separate the residue of silica by filtration on a small
filter (7 cm.) and wash with warm water, using as little as possible (Note 2). Receive the
filtrate in a beaker (200-500 cc.). Test the washings with ammonia for calcium phosphate, but
add all such tests in which a precipitate appears to the original nitrate (Note 3). The filtrate
and washings must be kept as small as possible and should not exceed 100 cc. in volume. Add
aqueous ammonia (sp. gr. 0.96) until the precipitate of calcium phosphate first produced just
fails to redissolve, and then add a few drops of nitric acid until this is again brought into
solution (Note 4). Warm the solution until it cannot be comfortably held in the hand (about
60°C.) and, after removal of the burner, add 75 cc. of ammonium molybdate solution which has
been !gently! warmed, but which must be perfectly clear. Allow the mixture to stand at a temperature
of about 50 or 60°C. for twelve hours (Notes 5 and 6). Filter off the yellow precipitate on
a 9 cm. filter, and wash by decantation with a solution of ammonium nitrate made acid with
nitric acid.[1] Allow the precipitate to remain in the beaker as far as possible. Test the
washings for calcium with ammonia and ammonium oxalate (Note 3).

[Footnote 1: This solution is prepared as follows: Mix 100 cc. of ammonia solution (sp. gr.
0.96) with 325 cc. of nitric acid (sp. gr. 1.2) and dilute with 100 cc. of water.]

Add 10 cc. of molybdate solution to the nitrate, and leave it for a few hours. It should then
be carefully examined for a !yellow! precipitate; a white precipitate may be neglected.

[Note 1: Magnesium ammonium phosphate, as noted below, is slightly soluble under the conditions
of operation. Consequently the unavoidable errors of analysis are greater in this determination
than in those which have preceded it, and some divergence may be expected in duplicate analyses.
It is obvious that the larger the amount of substance taken for analysis the less will be the
relative loss or gain due to unavoidable experimental errors; but, in this instance, a check
is placed upon the amount of material which may be taken both by the bulk of the resulting
precipitate of ammonium phosphomolybdate and by the excessive amount of ammonium molybdate
required to effect complete separation of the phosphoric acid, since a liberal excess above
the theoretical quantity is demanded. Molybdic acid is one of the more expensive reagents.]

[Note 2: Soluble silicic acid would, if present, partially separate with the phosphomolybdate,
although not in combination with molybdenum. Its previous removal by dehydration is therefore
necessary.]

[Note 3: When washing the siliceous residue the filtrate may be tested for calcium by adding
ammonia, since that reagent neutralizes the acid which holds the calcium phosphate in solution
and causes precipitation; but after the removal of the phosphoric acid in combination with
the molybdenum, the addition of an oxalate is required to show the presence of calcium.]

[Note 4: An excess of nitric acid exerts a slight solvent action, while ammonium nitrate lessens
the solubility; hence the neutralization of the former by ammonia.]

[Note 5: The precipitation of the phosphomolybdate takes place more promptly in warm than in
cold solutions, but the temperature should not exceed 60°C. during precipitation; a higher
temperature tends to separate molybdic acid from the solution. This acid is nearly white, and
its deposition in the filtrate on long standing should not be mistaken for a second precipitation
of the yellow precipitate. The addition of 75 cc. of ammonium molybdate solution insures the
presence of a liberal excess of the reagent, but the filtrate should be tested as in all quantitative
procedures.

The precipitation is probably complete in many cases in less than twelve hours; but it is better,
when practicable, to allow the solution to stand for this length of time. Vigorous shaking
or stirring promotes the separation of the precipitate.]

[Note 6: The composition of the "yellow precipitate" undoubtedly varies slightly with varying
conditions at the time of its formation. Its composition may probably fairly be represented
by the formula, (NH{4}){3}PO{4}.12MoO{3}.H{2}O, when precipitated under the conditions prescribed
in the procedure. Whatever other variations may occur in its composition, the ratio of 12 MoO{3}:1
P seems to hold, and this fact is utilized in volumetric processes for the determination of
phosphorus, in which the molybdenum is reduced to a lower oxide and reoxidized by a standard
solution of potassium permanganate. In principle, the procedure is comparable with that described
for the determination of iron by permanganate.]

PRECIPITATION OF MAGNESIUM AMMONIUM PHOSPHATE

PROCEDURE.--Dissolve the precipitate of phosphomolybdate upon the filter by pouring through
it dilute aqueous ammonia (one volume of dilute ammonia (sp. gr. 0.96) and three volumes of
water, which should be carefully measured), and receive the solution in the beaker containing
the bulk of the precipitate. The total volume of nitrate and washings should not much exceed
100 cc. Acidify the solution with dilute hydrochloric acid, and heat it nearly to boiling.
Calculate the volume of magnesium ammonium chloride solution ("magnesia mixture") required
to precipitate the phosphoric acid, assuming 40 per cent P{2}O{5} in the apatite. Measure out
about 5 cc. in excess of this amount, and pour it into the acid solution. Then add slowly dilute
ammonium hydroxide (1 volume of strong ammonia (sp. gr. 0.90) and 9 volumes of water), stirring
constantly until a precipitate forms. Then add a volume of filtered, concentrated ammonia (sp.
gr. 0.90) equal to one third of the volume of liquid in the beaker (Note 1). Allow the whole
to cool. The precipitated magnesium ammonium phosphate should then be definitely crystalline
in appearance (Note 2). (If it is desired to hasten the precipitation, the solution may be
cooled, first in cold and then in ice-water, and stirred !constantly! for half an hour, when
precipitation will usually be complete.)

Decant the clear liquid through a filter, and transfer the precipitate to the filter, using
as wash-water a mixture of one volume of concentrated ammonia and three volumes of water. It
is not necessary to clean the beaker completely or to wash the precipitate thoroughly at this
point, as it is necessary to purify it by reprecipitation.

[Note 1: Magnesium ammonium phosphate is not a wholly insoluble substance, even under the most
favorable analytical conditions. It is least soluble in a liquid containing one fourth of its
volume of concentrated aqueous ammonia (sp. gr. 0.90) and this proportion should be carefully
maintained as prescribed in the procedure. On account of this slight solubility the volume
of solutions should be kept as small as possible and the amount of wash-water limited to that
absolutely required.

A large excess of the magnesium solution tends both to throw out magnesium hydroxide (shown
by a persistently flocculent precipitate) and to cause the phosphate to carry down molybdic
acid. The tendency of the magnesium precipitate to carry down molybdic acid is also increased
if the solution is too concentrated. The volume should not be less than 90 cc., nor more than
125 cc., at the time of the first precipitation with the magnesia mixture.]

[Note 2: The magnesium ammonium phosphate should be perfectly crystalline, and will be so if
the directions are followed. The slow addition of the reagent is essential, and the stirring
not less so. Stirring promotes the separation of the precipitate and the formation of larger
crystals, and may therefore be substituted for digestion in the cold. The stirring-rod must
not be allowed to scratch the glass, as the crystals adhere to such scratches and are removed
with difficulty.]

REPRECIPITATION AND IGNITION OF MAGNESIUM AMMONIUM PHOSPHATE

A single precipitation of the magnesium compound in the presence of molybdenum compounds rarely
yields a pure product. The molybdenum can be removed by solution of the precipitate in acid
and precipitation of the molybdenum by sulphureted hydrogen, after which the magnesium precipitate
may be again thrown down. It is usually more satisfactory to dissolve the magnesium precipitate
and reprecipitate the phosphate as magnesium ammonium phosphate as described below.

PROCEDURE.--Dissolve the precipitate from the filter in a little dilute hydrochloric acid (sp.
gr. 1.12), allowing the acid solution to run into the beaker in which the original precipitation
was made (Note 1). Wash the filter with water until the wash-water shows no test for chlorides,
but avoid an unnecessary amount of wash-water. Add to the solution 2 cc. (not more) of magnesia
mixture, and then dilute ammonium hydroxide solution (sp. gr. 0.96), drop by drop, with constant
stirring, until the liquid smells distinctly of ammonia. Stir for a few moments and then add
a volume of strong ammonia (sp. gr. 0.90), equal to one third of the volume of the solution.
Allow the solution to stand for some hours, and then filter off the magnesium ammonium phosphate,
which should be distinctly crystalline in character. Wash the precipitate with dilute ammonia
water, as prescribed above, until, finally, 3 cc. of the washings, after acidifying with nitric
acid, show no evidence of chlorides. Test both filtrates for complete precipitation by adding
a few cubic centimeters of magnesia mixture and allowing them to stand for some time.

Transfer the moist precipitate to a weighed porcelain or platinum crucible and ignite, using
great care to raise the temperature slowly while drying the filter in the crucible, and to
insure the ready access of oxygen during the combustion of the filter paper, thus guarding
against a possible reduction of the phosphate, which would result in disastrous consequences
both to the crucible, if of platinum, and the analysis. Do not raise the temperature above
moderate redness until the precipitate is white. (Keep this precaution well in mind.) Ignite
finally at the highest temperature of the Tirrill burner, and repeat the heating until the
weight is constant. If the ignited precipitate is persistently discolored by particles of unburned
carbon, moisten the mass with a drop or two of concentrated nitric acid and heat cautiously,
finally igniting strongly. The acid will dissolve magnesium pyrophosphate from the surface
of the particles of carbon, which will then burn away. Nitric acid also aids as an oxidizing
agent in supplying oxygen for the combustion of the carbon.

From the weight of magnesium pyrophosphate (Mg{2}P{2}O{7}) obtained, calculate the phosphoric
anhydride (P{2}O{5}) in the sample of apatite.

[Note 1: The ionic change involved in the precipitation of the magnesium compound is

PO{4}^{---} + NH{4}^{+} + Mg^{++} --> [MgNH{4}PO{4}].

The magnesium ammonium phosphate is readily dissolved by acids, even those which are no stronger
than acetic acid. This is accounted for by the fact that two of the ions into which phosphoric
acid may dissociate, the HPO{4}^{--} or H{2}PO{4}^{-} ions, exhibit the characteristics of
very weak acids, in that they show almost no tendency to dissociate further into H^{+} and
PO{4}^{--} ions. Consequently the ionic changes which occur when the magnesium ammonium phosphate
is brought into contact with an acid may be typified by the reaction:

H^{+} + Mg^{++} + NH{4}^{+} + PO{4}^{---} --> Mg^{++} + NH{4}^{+} + HPO{4}^{--};

that is, the PO{4}^{--} ions and the H^{+} ions lose their identity in the formation of the
new ion, HPO{4}^{--}, and this continues until the magnesium ammonium phosphate is entirely
dissolved.]

[Note 2: During ignition the magnesium ammonium phosphate loses ammonia and water and is converted
into magnesium pyrophosphate:

2MgNH{4}PO{4} --> Mg{2}P{2}O{7} + 2NH{3} + H{2}O.

The precautions mentioned on pages 111 and 123 must be observed with great care during the
ignition of this precipitate. The danger here lies in a possible reduction of the phosphate
by the carbon of the filter paper, or by the ammonia evolved, which may act as a reducing agent.
The phosphorus then attacks and injures a platinum crucible, and the determination is valueless.]

ANALYSIS OF LIMESTONE

Limestones vary widely in composition from a nearly pure marble through the dolomitic limestones,
containing varying amounts of magnesium, to the impure varieties, which contain also ferrous
and manganous carbonates and siliceous compounds in variable proportions. Many other minerals
may be inclosed in limestones in small quantities, and an exact qualitative analysis will often
show the presence of sulphides or sulphates, phosphates, and titanates, and the alkali or even
the heavy metals. No attempt is made in the following procedures to provide a complete quantitative
scheme which would take into account all of these constituents. Such a scheme for a complete
analysis of a limestone may be found in Bulletin No. 700 of the United States Geological Survey.
It is assumed that, for these practice determinations, a limestone is selected which contains
only the more common constituents first enumerated above.

DETERMINATION OF MOISTURE

The determination of the amount of moisture in minerals or ores is often of great importance.
Ores which have been exposed to the weather during shipment may have absorbed enough moisture
to appreciably affect the results of analysis. Since it is essential that the seller and buyer
should make their analyses upon comparable material, it is customary for each analyst to determine
the moisture in the sample examined, and then to calculate the percentages of the various constituents
with reference to a sample dried in the air, or at a temperature a little above 100°C., which,
unless the ore has undergone chemical change because of the wetting, should be the same before
and after shipment.

PROCEDURE.--Spread 25 grams of the powdered sample on a weighed watch-glass; weigh to the nearest
10 milligrams only and heat at 105°C.; weigh at intervals of an hour, after cooling in a desiccator,
until the loss of weight after an hour's heating does not exceed 10 milligrams. It should be
noted that a variation in weight of 10 milligrams in a total weight of 25 grams is no greater
relatively than a variation of 0.1 milligram when the sample taken weighs 0.25 gram

DETERMINATION OF THE INSOLUBLE MATTER AND SILICA

PROCEDURE.--Weigh out two portions of the original powdered sample (not the dried sample),
of about 5 grams each, into 250 cc. casseroles, and cover each with a watch-glass (Note 1).
Pour over the powder 25 cc. of water, and then add 50 cc. of dilute hydrochloric acid (sp.
gr. 1.12) in small portions, warming gently, until nothing further appears to dissolve (Note
2). Evaporate to dryness on the water bath. 1.12) to five volumes water), and boil for about
five minutes; then filter and wash twice with the dilute hydrochloric acid, and then with hot
water until free from chlorides. Transfer the filter and contents to a porcelain crucible,
dry carefully over a low flame, and ignite to constant weight. The residue represents the insoluble
matter and the silica from any soluble silicates (Note 3).

Calculate the combined percentage of these in the limestone.

[Note 1: The relatively large weight (5 grams) taken for analysis insures greater accuracy
in the determination of the ingredients which are present in small proportions, and is also
more likely to be a representative sample of the material analyzed.]

[Note 2: It is plain that the amount of the insoluble residue and also its character will often
depend upon the strength of acid used for solution of the limestone. It cannot, therefore,
be regarded as representing any well-defined constituent, and its determination is essentially
empirical.]

[Note 3: It is probable that some of the silicates present are wholly or partly decomposed
by the acid, and the soluble silicic acid must be converted by evaporation to dryness, and
heating, into white, insoluble silica. This change is not complete after one evaporation. The
heating at a temperature somewhat higher than that of the water bath for a short time tends
to leave the silica in the form of a powder, which promotes subsequent filtration. The siliceous
residue is washed first with dilute acid to prevent hydrolytic changes, which would result
in the formation of appreciable quantities of insoluble basic iron or aluminium salts on the
filter when washing with hot water.

If it is desired to determine the percentage of silica separately, the ignited residue should
be mixed in a platinum crucible with about six times its weight of anhydrous sodium carbonate,
and the procedure given on page 151 should be followed. The filtrate from the silica is then
added to the main filtrate from the insoluble residue.]

DETERMINATION OF FERRIC OXIDE AND ALUMINIUM OXIDE (WITH MANGANESE)

PROCEDURE.--To the filtrate from the insoluble residue add ammonium hydroxide until the solution
just smells distinctly of ammonia, but do not add an excess. Then add 5 cc. of saturated bromine
water (Note 1), and boil for five minutes. If the smell of ammonia has disappeared, again add
ammonium hydroxide in slight excess, and 3 cc. of bromine water, and heat again for a few minutes.
Finally add 10 cc. of ammonium chloride solution and keep the solution warm until it barely
smells of ammonia; then filter promptly (Note 2). Wash the filter twice with hot water, then
(after replacing the receiving beaker) pour through it 25 cc. of hot, dilute hydrochloric acid
(one volume dilute HCl [sp. gr. 1.12] to five volumes water). A brown residue insoluble in
the acid may be allowed to remain on the filter. Wash the filter five times with hot water,
add to the filtrate ammonium hydroxide and bromine water as described above, and repeat the
precipitation. Collect the precipitate on the filter already used, wash it free from chlorides
with hot water, and ignite and weigh as described for ferric hydroxide on page 110. The residue
after ignition consists of ferric oxide, alumina, and mangano-manganic oxide (Mn{3}O{4}), if
manganese is present. These are commonly determined together (Note 3).

Calculate the percentage of the combined oxides in the limestone.

[Note 1: The addition of bromine water to the ammoniacal solutions serves to oxidize any ferrous
hydroxide to ferric hydroxide and to precipitate manganese as MnO(OH){2}. The solution must
contain not more than a bare excess of hydroxyl ions (ammonium hydroxide) when it is filtered,
on account of the tendency of the aluminium hydroxide to redissolve.

The solution should not be strongly ammoniacal when the bromine is added, as strong ammonia
reacts with the bromine, with the evolution of nitrogen.]

[Note 2: The precipitate produced by ammonium hydroxide and bromine should be filtered off
promptly, since the alkaline solution absorbs carbon dioxide from the air, with consequent
partial precipitation of the calcium as carbonate. This is possible even under the most favorable
conditions, and for this reason the iron precipitate is redissolved and again precipitated
to free it from calcium. When the precipitate is small, this reprecipitation may be omitted.]

[Note 3: In the absence of significant amounts of manganese the iron and aluminium may be separately
determined by fusion of the mixed ignited precipitate, after weighing, with about ten times
its weight of acid potassium sulphate, solution of the cold fused mass in water, and volumetric
determination of the iron, as described on page 66. The aluminium is then determined by difference,
after subtracting the weight of ferric oxide corresponding to the amount of iron found.

If a separate determination of the iron, aluminium, and manganese is desired, the mixed precipitate
may be dissolved in acid before ignition, and the separation effected by special methods (see,
for example, Fay, !Quantitative Analyses!, First Edition, pp. 15-19 and 23-27).]

DETERMINATION OF CALCIUM

PROCEDURE.--To the combined filtrates from the double precipitation of the hydroxides just
described, add 5 cc. of dilute ammonium hydroxide (sp. gr. 0.96), and transfer the liquid to
a 500 cc. graduated flask, washing out the beaker carefully. Cool to laboratory temperature,
and fill the flask with distilled water until the lowest point of the meniscus is exactly level
with the mark on the neck of the flask. Repeat the same operation. Fill the 100 cc. flask until
the lowest point of the meniscus is exactly level with the mark on its neck, remove any drops
of solution from the upper part of the neck with filter paper, and pour the solution into a
beaker (400-500 cc.). Wash out the flask with small quantities of water until it is clean,
adding these to the 100 cc. of solution. When the duplicate portion of 100 cc. is measured
out from the solution, remember that the flask must be rinsed out twice with that solution,
as prescribed above, before the measurement is made. (A 100 cc. pipette may be used to measure
out the aliquot portions, if preferred.)

Dilute each of the measured portions to 250 cc. with distilled water, heat the whole to boiling,
and add ammonium oxalate solution slowly in moderate excess, stirring well. Boil for two minutes;
allow the precipitated calcium oxalate to settle for a half-hour, and decant through a filter.
Test the filtrate for complete precipitation by adding a few cubic centimeters of the precipitant,
allowing it to stand for fifteen minutes. If no precipitate forms, make the solution slightly
acid with hydrochloric acid (Note 2); see that it is properly labeled and reserve it to be
combined with the filtrate from the second calcium oxalate precipitation (Notes 3 and 4).

Redissolve the calcium oxalate in the beaker with warm hydrochloric acid, pouring the acid
through the filter. Wash the filter five times with water, and finally pour through it aqueous
ammonia. Dilute the solution to 250 cc., bring to boiling, and add 1 cc. ammonium oxalate solution
(Note 5) and ammonia in slight excess; boil for two minutes, and set aside for a half-hour.
Filter off the calcium oxalate upon the filter first used, and wash free from chlorides. The
filtrate should be made barely acid with hydrochloric acid and combined with the filtrate from
the first precipitation. Begin at once the evaporation of the solutions for the determination
of magnesium as described below.

The precipitate of calcium oxalate may be converted into calcium oxide by ignition without
previous drying. After burning the filter, it may be ignited for three quarters of an hour
in a platinum crucible at the highest heat of the Bunsen or Tirrill burner, and finally for
ten minutes at the blast lamp (Note 6). Repeat the heating over the blast lamp until the weight
is constant. As the calcium oxide absorbs moisture from the air, it must (after cooling) be
weighed as rapidly as possible.

The precipitate may, if preferred, be placed in a weighted porcelain crucible. After burning
off the filter and heating for ten minutes the calcium precipitate may be converted into calcium
sulphate by placing 2 cc. of dilute sulphuric acid in the crucible (cold), heating the covered
crucible very cautiously over a low flame to drive off the excess of acid, and finally at redness
to constant weight (Note 7).

From the weight of the oxide or sulphate, calculate the percentage of the calcium (Ca) in the
limestone, remembering that only one fifth of the total solution is used for this determination.

[Note 1: If the calcium were precipitated from the entire solution, the quantity of the precipitate
would be greater than could be properly treated. The solution is, therefore, diluted to a definite
volume (500 cc.), and exactly one fifth (100 cc.) is measured off in a graduated flask or by
means of a pipette.]

[Note 2: The filtrate from the calcium oxalate should be made slightly acid immediately after
filtration, in order to avoid the solvent action of the alkaline liquid upon the glass.]

[Note 3: The accurate quantitative separation of calcium and magnesium as oxalates requires
considerable care. The calcium precipitate usually carries down with it some magnesium, and
this can best be removed by redissolving the precipitate after filtration, and reprecipitation
in the presence of only the small amount of magnesium which was included in the first precipitate.
When, however, the proportion of magnesium is not very large, the second precipitation of the
calcium can usually be avoided by precipitating it from a rather dilute solution (800 cc. or
so) and in the presence of a considerable excess of the precipitant, that is, rather more than
enough to convert both the magnesium and calcium into oxalates.]

[Note 4: The ionic changes involved in the precipitation of calcium as oxalate are exceedingly
simple, and the principles discussed in connection with the barium sulphate precipitation on
page 113 also apply here. The reaction is

C{2}O{4}^{--} + Ca^{++} --> [CaC{2}O{4}].

Calcium oxalate is nearly insoluble in water, and only very slightly soluble in acetic acid,
but is readily dissolved by the strong mineral acids. This behavior with acids is explained
by the fact that oxalic acid is a stronger acid than acetic acid; when, therefore, the oxalate
is brought into contact with the latter there is almost no tendency to diminish the concentration
of C{2}O{4}^{--} ions by the formation of an acid less dissociated than the acetic acid itself,
and practically no solvent action ensues. When a strong mineral acid is present, however, the
ionization of the oxalic acid is much reduced by the high concentration of the H^{+} ions from
the strong acid, the formation of the undissociated acid lessens the concentration of the C{2}O{4}^{--}
ions in solution, more of the oxalate passes into solution to re-establish equilibrium, and
this process repeats itself until all is dissolved.

The oxalate is immediately reprecipitated from such a solution on the addition of OH^{-} ions,
which, by uniting with the H^{+} ions of the acids (both the mineral acid and the oxalic acid)
to form water, leave the Ca^{++} and C{2}O{4}^{--} ions in the solution to recombine to form
[CaC{2}O{4}], which is precipitated in the absence of the H^{+} ions. It is well at this point
to add a small excess of C{2}O{4}^{--} ions in the form of ammonium oxalate to decrease the
solubility of the precipitate.

The oxalate precipitate consists mainly of CaC{2}O{4}.H{2}O when thrown down.]

[Note 5: The small quantity of ammonium oxalate solution is added before the second precipitation
of the calcium oxalate to insure the presence of a slight excess of the reagent, which promotes
the separation of the calcium compound.]

[Note 6: On ignition the calcium oxalate loses carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide, leaving
calcium oxide:

CaC{2}O{4}.H{2}O --> CaO + CO{2} + CO + H{2}O.

For small weights of the oxalate (0.6 gram or less) this reaction may be brought about in a
platinum crucible at the highest temperature of a Tirrill burner, but it is well to ignite
larger quantities than this over the blast lamp until the weight is constant.]

[Note 7: The heat required to burn the filter, and that subsequently applied as described,
will convert most of the calcium oxalate to calcium carbonate, which is changed to sulphate
by the sulphuric acid. The reactions involved are

CaC{2}O{4} --> CaCO{3} + CO, CaCO{3} + H{2}SO{4} --> CaSO{4} + H{2}O + CO{2}.

If a porcelain crucible is employed for ignition, this conversion to sulphate is to be preferred,
as a complete conversion to oxide is difficult to accomplish.]

[Note 8: The determination of the calcium may be completed volumetrically by washing the calcium
oxalate precipitate from the filter into dilute sulphuric acid, warming, and titrating the
liberated oxalic acid with a standard solution of potassium permanganate as described on page
72. When a considerable number of analyses are to be made, this procedure will save much of
the time otherwise required for ignition and weighing.]

DETERMINATION OF MAGNESIUM

PROCEDURE.--Evaporate the acidified filtrates from the calcium precipitates until the salts
begin to crystallize, but do !not! evaporate to dryness (Note 1). Dilute the solution cautiously
until the salts are brought into solution, adding a little acid if the solution has evaporated
to very small volume. The solution should be carefully examined at this point and must be filtered
if a precipitate has appeared. Heat the clear solution to boiling; remove the burner and add
25 cc. of a solution of disodium phosphate. Finally, add a volume of concentrated ammonia (sp.
gr. 0.90) equal to one third of the volume of the solution, and allow the whole to stand for
about twelve hours.

Decant the solution through a filter, wash it with dilute ammonia water, proceeding as prescribed
for the determination of phosphoric anhydride on page 122, including; the reprecipitation (Note
2), except that 3 cc. of disodium phosphate solution are added before the reprecipitation of
the magnesium ammonium phosphate instead of the magnesia mixture there prescribed. From the
weight of the pyrophosphate, calculate the percentage of magnesium oxide (MgO) in the sample
of limestone. Remember that the pyrophosphate finally obtained is from one fifth of the original
sample.

[Note 1: The precipitation of the magnesium should be made in as small volume as possible,
and the ratio of ammonia to the total volume of solution should be carefully provided for,
on account of the relative solubility of the magnesium ammonium phosphate. This matter has
been fully discussed in connection with the phosphoric anhydride determination.]

[Note 2: The first magnesium ammonium phosphate precipitate is rarely wholly crystalline, as
it should be, and is not always of the proper composition when precipitated in the presence
of such large amounts of ammonium salts. The difficulty can best be remedied by filtering the
precipitate and (without washing it) redissolving in a small quantity of hydrochloric acid,
from which it may be again thrown down by ammonia after adding a little disodium phosphate
solution. If the flocculent character was occasioned by the presence of magnesium hydroxide,
the second precipitation, in a smaller volume containing fewer salts, will often result more
favorably.

The removal of iron or alumina from a contaminated precipitate is a matter involving a long
procedure, and a redetermination of the magnesium from a new sample, with additional precautions,
is usually to be preferred.]

DETERMINATION OF CARBON DIOXIDE

!Absorption Apparatus!

The apparatus required for the determination of the carbon dioxide should be arranged as shown
in the cut (Fig. 3). The flask (A) is an ordinary wash bottle, which should be nearly filled
with dilute hydrochloric acid (100 cc. acid (sp. gr. 1.12) and 200 cc. of water). The flask
is connected by rubber tubing (a) with the glass tube (b) leading nearly to the bottom of the
evolution flask (B) and having its lower end bent upward and drawn out to small bore, so that
the carbon dioxide evolved from the limestone cannot bubble back into (b). The evolution flask
should preferably be a wide-mouthed Soxhlet extraction flask of about 150 cc. capacity because
of the ease with which tubes and stoppers may be fitted into the neck of a flask of this type.
The flask should be fitted with a two-hole rubber stopper. The condenser (C) may consist of
a tube with two or three large bulbs blown in it, for use as an air-cooled condenser, or it
may be a small water-jacketed condenser. The latter is to be preferred if a number of determinations
are to be made in succession.

A glass delivery tube (c) leads from the condenser to the small U-tube (D) containing some
glass beads or small pieces of glass rod and 3 cc. of a saturated solution of silver sulphate,
with 3 cc. of concentrated sulphuric acid (sp. gr. 1.84). The short rubber tubing (d) connects
the first U-tube to a second U-tube (E) which is filled with small dust-free lumps of dry calcium
chloride, with a small, loose plug of cotton at the top of each arm. Both tubes should be closed
by cork stoppers, the tops of which are cut off level with, or preferably forced a little below,
the top of the U-tube, and then neatly sealed with sealing wax.

The carbon dioxide may be absorbed in a tube containing soda lime (F) or in a Geissler bulb
(F') containing a concentrated solution of potassium hydroxide (Note 2). The tube (F) is a
glass-stoppered side-arm U-tube in which the side toward the evolution flask and one half of
the other side are filled with small, dust-free lumps of soda lime of good quality (Note 3).
Since soda lime contains considerable moisture, the other half of the right side of the tube
is filled with small lumps of dry, dust-free calcium chloride to retain the moisture from the
soda lime. Loose plugs of cotton are placed at the top of each arm and between the soda lime
and the calcium chloride.

The Geissler bulb (F'), if used, should be filled with potassium hydroxide solution (1 part
of solid potassium hydroxide dissolved in two parts of water) until each small bulb is about
two thirds full (Note 4). A small tube containing calcium chloride is connected with the Geissler
bulb proper by a ground joint and should be wired to the bulb for safety. This is designed
to retain any moisture from the hydroxide solution. A piece of clean, fine copper wire is so
attached to the bulb that it can be hung from the hook above a balance pan, or other support.

The small bottle (G) with concentrated sulphuric acid (sp. gr. 1.84) is so arranged that the
tube (f) barely dips below the surface. This will prevent the absorption of water vapor by
(F) or (F') and serves as an aid in regulating the flow of air through the apparatus. (H) is
an aspirator bottle of about four liters capacity, filled with water; (k) is a safety tube
and a means of refilling (H); (h) is a screw clamp, and (K) a U-tube filled with soda lime.

[Note 1: The air current, which is subsequently drawn through the apparatus, to sweep all of
the carbon dioxide into the absorption apparatus, is likely to carry with it some hydrochloric
acid from the evolution flask. This acid is retained by the silver sulphate solution. The addition
of concentrated sulphuric acid to this solution reduces its vapor pressure so far that very
little water is carried on by the air current, and this slight amount is absorbed by the calcium
chloride in (E). As the calcium chloride frequently contains a small amount of a basic material
which would absorb carbon dioxide, it is necessary to pass carbon dioxide through (E) for a
short time and then drive all the gas out with a dry air current for thirty minutes before use.]

[Note 2: Soda-lime absorption tubes are to be preferred if a satisfactory quality of soda lime
is available and the number of determinations to be made successively is small. The potash
bulbs will usually permit of a larger number of successive determinations without refilling,
but they require greater care in handling and in the analytical procedure.]

[Note 3: Soda lime is a mixture of sodium and calcium hydroxides. Both combine with carbon
dioxide to form carbonates, with the evolution of water. Considerable heat is generated by
the reaction, and the temperature of the tube during absorption serves as a rough index of
the progress of the reaction through the mass of soda lime.

It is essential that soda lime of good quality for analytical purposes should be used. The
tube should not contain dust, as this is likely to be swept away.]

[Note 4: The solution of the hydroxide for use in the Geissler bulb must be highly concentrated
to insure complete absorption of the carbon dioxide and also to reduce the vapor pressure of
the solution, thus lessening the danger of loss of water with the air which passes through
the bulbs. The small quantity of moisture which is then carried out of the bulbs is held by
the calcium chloride in the prolong tube. The best form of absorption bulb is that to which
the prolong tube is attached by a ground glass joint.

After the potassium hydroxide is approximately half consumed in the first bulb of the absorption
apparatus, potassium bicarbonate is formed, and as it is much less soluble than the carbonate,
it often precipitates. Its formation is a warning that the absorbing power of the hydroxide
is much diminished.]

!The Analysis!

PROCEDURE.-- Weigh out into the flask (B) about 1 gram of limestone. Cover it with 15 cc. of
water. Weigh the absorption apparatus (F) or (F') accurately after allowing it to stand for
30 minutes in the balance case, and wiping it carefully with a lintless cloth, taking care
to handle it as little as possible after wiping (Note 1). Connect the absorption apparatus
with (e) and (f). If a soda-lime tube is used, be sure that the arm containing the soda lime
is next the tube (E) and that the glass stopcocks are open.

To be sure that the whole apparatus is airtight, disconnect the rubber tube from the flask
(A), making sure that the tubes (a) and (b) do not contain any hydrochloric acid, close the
pinchcocks (a) and (k) and open (h). No bubbles should pass through (D) or (G) after a few
seconds. When assured that the fittings are tight, close (h) and open (a) cautiously to admit
air to restore atmospheric pressure. This precaution is essential, as a sudden inrush of air
will project liquid from (D) or (F'). Reconnect the rubber tube with the flask (A). Open the
pinchcocks (a) and (k) and blow over about 10 cc. of the hydrochloric acid from (A) into (B).
When the action of the acid slackens, blow over (slowly) another 10 cc.

The rate of gas evolution should not exceed for more than a few seconds that at which about
two bubbles per second pass through (G) (Note 2). Repeat the addition of acid in small portions
until the action upon the limestone seems to be at an end, taking care to close (a) after each
addition of acid (Note 3). Disconnect (A) and connect the rubber tubing with the soda-lime
tube (K) and open (a). Then close (k) and open (h), regulating the flow of water from (H) in
such a way that about two bubbles per second pass through (G). Place a small flame under (B)
and !slowly! raise the contents to boiling and boil for three minutes. Then remove the burner
from under (B) and continue to draw air through the apparatus for 20-30 minutes, or until (H)
is emptied (Note 4). Remove the absorption apparatus, closing the stopcocks on (F) or stoppering
the open ends of (F'), leave the apparatus in the balance case for at least thirty minutes,
wipe it carefully and weigh, after opening the stopcocks (or removing plugs). The increase
in weight is due to absorption of CO{2}, from which its percentage in the sample may be calculated.

After cleaning (B) and refilling (H), the apparatus is ready for the duplicate analysis.

[Note 1: The absorption tubes or bulbs have large surfaces on which moisture may collect. By
allowing them to remain in the balance case for some time before weighing, the amount of moisture
absorbed on the surface is as nearly constant as practicable during two weighings, and a uniform
temperature is also assured. The stopcocks of the U-tube should be opened, or the plugs used
to close the openings of the Geissler bulb should be removed before weighing in order that
the air contents shall always be at atmospheric pressure.]

[Note 2: If the gas passes too rapidly into the absorption apparatus, some carbon dioxide may
be carried through, not being completely retained by the absorbents.]

[Note 3: The essential ionic changes involved in this procedure are the following: It is assumed
that the limestone, which is typified by calcium carbonate, is very slightly soluble in water,
and the ions resulting are Ca^{++} and CO{3}^{--}. In the presence of H^{+} ions of the mineral
acid, the CO{3}^{--} ions form [H{2}CO{3}]. This is not only a weak acid which, by its formation,
diminishes the concentration of the CO{3}^{--} ions, thus causing more of the carbonate to
dissolve to re-establish equilibrium, but it is also an unstable compound and breaks down into
carbon dioxide and water.]

[Note 4: Carbon dioxide is dissolved by cold water, but the gas is expelled by boiling, and,
together with that which is distributed through the apparatus, is swept out into the absorption
bulb by the current of air. This air is purified by drawing it through the tube (K) containing
soda lime, which removes any carbon dioxide which may be in it.]

DETERMINATION OF LEAD, COPPER, IRON, AND ZINC IN BRASS

ELECTROLYTIC SEPARATIONS

!General Discussion!

When a direct current of electricity passes from one electrode to another through solutions
of electrolytes, the individual ions present in these solutions tend to move toward the electrode
of opposite electrical charge to that which each ion bears, and to be discharged by that electrode.
Whether or not such discharge actually occurs in the case of any particular ion depends upon
the potential (voltage) of the current which is passing through the solution, since for each
ion there is, under definite conditions, a minimum potential below which the discharge of the
ion cannot be effected. By taking advantage of differences in discharge-potentials, it is possible
to effect separations of a number of the metallic ions by electrolysis, and at the same time
to deposit the metals in forms which admit of direct weighing. In this way the slower procedures
of precipitation and filtration may frequently be avoided. The following paragraphs present
a brief statement of the fundamental principles and conditions underlying electro-analysis.

The total energy of an electric current as it passes through a solution is distributed among
three factors, first, its potential, which is measured in volts, and corresponds to what is
called "head" in a stream of water; second, current strength, which is measured in amperes,
and corresponds to the volume of water passing a cross-section of a stream in a given time
interval; and third, the resistance of the conducting medium, which is measured in ohms. The
relation between these three factors is expressed by Ohm's law, namely, that !I = E/R!, when
I is current strength, E potential, and R resistance. It is plain that, for a constant resistance,
the strength of the current and its potential are mutually and directly interdependent.

As already stated, the applied electrical potential determines whether or not deposition of
a metal upon an electrode actually occurs. The current strength determines the rate of deposition
and the physical characteristics of the deposit. The resistance of the solution is generally
so small as to fall out of practical consideration.

Approximate deposition-potentials have been determined for a number of the metallic elements,
and also for hydrogen and some of the acid-forming radicals. The values given below are those
required for deposition from normal solutions at ordinary temperatures with reference to a
hydrogen electrode. They must be regarded as approximate, since several disturbing factors
and some secondary reactions render difficult their exact application under the conditions
of analysis. They are:

 Zn    Cd    Fe    Ni    Pb    H  Cu    Sb    Hg    Ag    SO{4}
+0.77 +0.42 +0.34 +0.33 +0.13  0 -0.34 -0.67 -0.76 -0.79 +1.90

From these data it is evident that in order to deposit copper from a normal solution of copper
sulphate a minimum potential equal to the algebraic sum of the deposition-potentials of copper
ions and sulphate ions must be applied, that is, +1.56 volts. The deposition of zinc from a
solution of zinc sulphate would require +2.67 volts, but, since the deposition of hydrogen
from sulphuric acid solution requires only +1.90 volts, the quantitative deposition of zinc
by electrolysis from a sulphuric acid solution of a zinc salt is not practicable. On the other
hand, silver, if present in a solution of copper sulphate, would deposit with the copper.

The foregoing examples suffice to illustrate the application of the principle of deposition
potentials, but it must further be noted that the values stated apply to normal solutions of
the compounds in question, that is, to solutions of considerable concentrations. As the concentration
of the ions diminishes, and hence fewer ions approach the electrodes, somewhat higher voltages
are required to attract and discharge them. From this it follows that the concentrations should
be kept as high as possible to effect complete deposition in the least practicable time, or
else the potentials applied must be progressively increased as deposition proceeds. In practice,
the desired result is obtained by starting with small volumes of solution, using as large an
electrode surface as possible, and by stirring the solution to bring the ions in contact with
the electrodes. This is, in general, a more convenient procedure than that of increasing the
potential of the current during electrolysis, although that method is also used.

As already stated, those ions in a solution of electrolytes will first be discharged which
have the lowest deposition potentials, and so long as these ions are present around the electrode
in considerable concentration they, almost alone, are discharged, but, as their concentration
diminishes, other ions whose deposition potentials are higher but still within that of the
current applied, will also begin to separate. For example, from a nitric acid solution of copper
nitrate, the copper ions will first be discharged at the cathode, but as they diminish in concentration
hydrogen ions from the acid (or water) will be also discharged. Since the hydrogen thus liberated
is a reducing agent, the nitric acid in the solution is slowly reduced to ammonia, and it may
happen that if the current is passed through for a long time, such a solution will become alkaline.
Oxygen is liberated at the anode, but, since there is no oxidizable substance present around
that electrode, it escapes as oxygen gas. It should be noted that, in general, the changes
occurring at the cathode are reductions, while those at the anode are oxidations.

For analytical purposes, solutions of nitrates or sulphates of the metals are preferable to
those of the chlorides, since liberated chlorine attacks the electrodes. In some cases, as
for example, that of silver, solution of salts forming complex ions, like that of the double
cyanide of silver and potassium, yield better metallic deposits.

Most metals are deposited as such upon the cathode; a few, notably lead and manganese, separate
in the form of dioxides upon the anode. It is evidently important that the deposited material
should be so firmly adherent that it can be washed, dried, and weighed without loss in handling.
To secure these conditions it is essential that the current density (that is, the amount of
current per unit of area of the electrodes) shall not be too high. In prescribing analytical
conditions it is customary to state the current strength in "normal densities" expressed in
amperes per 100 sq. cm. of electrode surface, as, for example, "N.D{100} = 2 amps."

If deposition occurs too rapidly, the deposit is likely to be spongy or loosely adherent and
falls off on subsequent treatment. This places a practical limit to the current density to
be employed, for a given electrode surface. The cause of the unsatisfactory character of the
deposit is apparently sometimes to be found in the coincident liberation of considerable hydrogen
and sometimes in the failure of the rapidly deposited material to form a continuous adherent
surface. The effect of rotating electrodes upon the character of the deposit is referred to below.

The negative ions of an electrolyte are attracted to the anode and are discharged on contact
with it. Anions such as the chloride ion yield chlorine atoms, from which gaseous chlorine
molecules are formed and escape. The radicals which compose such ions as NO{3}^{-} or SO{4}^{--}
are not capable of independent existence after discharge, and break down into oxygen and N{2}O{5}
and SO{3} respectively. The oxygen escapes and the anhydrides, reacting with water, re-form
nitric and sulphuric acids.

The law of Faraday expresses the relation between current strength and the quantities of the
decomposition products which, under constant conditions, appear at the electrodes, namely,
that a given quantity of electricity, acting for a given time, causes the separation of chemically
equivalent quantities of the various elements or radicals. For example, since 107.94 grams
of silver is equivalent to 1.008 grams of hydrogen, and that in turn to 8 grams of oxygen,
or 31.78 grams of copper, the quantity of electricity which will cause the deposit of 107.94
grams of silver in a given time will also separate the weights just indicated of the other
substances. Experiments show that a current of one ampere passing for one second, i.e., a coulomb
of electricity, causes the deposition of 0.001118 gram of silver from a normal solution of
a silver salt. The number of coulombs required to deposit 107.94 grams is 107.94/0.001118 or
96,550 and the same number of coulombs will also cause the separation of 1.008 grams of hydrogen,
8 grams of oxygen or 31.78 grams of copper. While it might at first appear that Faraday's law
could thus be used as a basis for the calculation of the time required for the deposition of
a given quantity of an electrolyte from solution, it must be remembered that the law expresses
what occurs when the concentration of the ions in the solution is kept constant, as, for example,
when the anode in a silver salt solution is a plate of metallic silver. Under the conditions
of electro-analysis the concentration of the ions is constantly diminishing as deposition proceeds
and the time actually required for complete deposition of a given weight of material by a current
of constant strength is, therefore, greater than that calculated on the basis of the law as
stated above.

The electrodes employed in electro-analysis are almost exclusively of platinum, since that
metal alone satisfactorily resists chemical action of the electrolytes, and can be dried and
weighed without change in composition. The platinum electrodes may be used in the form of dishes,
foil or gauze. The last, on account of the ease of circulation of the electrolyte, its relatively
large surface in proportion to its weight and the readiness with which it can be washed and
dried, is generally preferred.

Many devices have been described by the use of which the electrode upon which deposition occurs
can be mechanically rotated. This has an effect parallel to that of greatly increasing the
electrode surface and also provides a most efficient means of stirring the solution. With such
an apparatus the amperage may be increased to 5 or even 10 amperes and depositions completed
with great rapidity and accuracy. It is desirable, whenever practicable, to provide a rotating
or stirring device, since, for example, the time consumed in the deposition of the amount of
copper usually found in analysis may be reduced from the 20 to 24 hours required with stationary
electrodes, and unstirred solutions, to about one half hour.

DETERMINATION OF COPPER AND LEAD

PROCEDURE.--Weigh out two portions of about 0.5 gram each (Note 1) into tall, slender lipless
beakers of about 100 cc. capacity. When the sample has all dissolved (Note 2), wash down the
sides of the beaker and the bottom of the watch-glass with water and dilute the solution to
about 50 cc. Carefully heat to boiling and boil for a minute or two to expel nitrous fumes.

Meanwhile, four platinum electrodes, two anodes and two cathodes, should be cleaned by dipping
in dilute nitric acid, washing with water and finally with 95 per cent alcohol (Note 3). The
alcohol may be ignited and burned off. The electrodes are then cooled in a desiccator and weighed.
Connect the electrodes with the binding posts (or other device for connection with the electric
circuit) in such a way that the copper will be deposited upon the electrode with the larger
surface, which is made the cathode. The beaker containing the solution should then be raised
into place from below the electrodes until the latter reach nearly to the bottom of the beaker.
The support for the beaker must be so arranged that it can be easily raised or lowered.

If the electrolytic apparatus is provided with a mechanism for the rotation of the electrode
or stirring of the electrolyte, proceed as follows: Arrange the resistance in the circuit to
provide a direct current of about one ampere. Pass this current through the solution to be
electrolyzed, and start the rotating mechanism. Keep the beaker covered as completely as possible,
using a split watch-glass (or other device) to avoid loss by spattering. When the solution
is colorless, which is usually the case after about 35 minutes, rinse off the cover glass,
wash down the sides of the beaker, add about 0.30 gram of urea and continue the electrolysis
for another five minutes (Notes 4 and 5).

If stationary electrodes are employed, the current strength should be about 0.1 ampere, which
may, after 12 to 15 hours, be increased to 0.2 ampere. The time required for complete deposition
is usually from 20 to 24 hours. It is advisable to add 5 cc. of nitric acid (sp. gr. 1.2) if
the electrolysis extends over this length of time. No urea is added in this case.

When the deposition of the copper appears to be complete, stop the rotating mechanism and slowly
lower the beaker with the left hand, directing at the same time a stream of water from a wash
bottle on both electrodes. Remove the beaker, shut off the current, and, if necessary, complete
the washing of the electrodes (Note 6). Rinse the electrodes cautiously with alcohol and heat
them in a hot closet until the alcohol has just evaporated, but no longer, since the copper
is likely to oxidize at the higher temperature. (The alcohol may be removed by ignition if
care is taken to keep the electrodes in motion in the air so that the copper deposit is not
too strongly heated at any one point.)

Test the solution in the beaker for copper as follows, remembering that it is to be used for
subsequent determinations of iron and zinc: Remove about 5 cc. and add a slight excess of ammonia.
Compare the mixture with some distilled water, holding both above a white surface. The solution
should not show any tinge of blue. If the presence of copper is indicated, add the test portion
to the main solution, evaporate the whole to a volume of about 100 cc., and again electrolyze
with clean electrodes (Note 7).

After cooling the electrodes in a desiccator, weigh them and from the weight of copper on the
cathode and of lead dioxide (PbO{2}) on the anode, calculate the percentage of copper (Cu)
and of lead (Pb) in the brass.

[Note 1: It is obvious that the brass taken for analysis should be untarnished, which can be
easily assured, when wire is used, by scouring with emery. If chips or borings are used, they
should be well mixed, and the sample for analysis taken from different parts of the mixture.]

[Note 2: If a white residue remains upon treatment of the alloy with nitric acid, it indicates
the presence of tin. The material is not, therefore, a true brass. This may be treated as follows:
Evaporate the solution to dryness, moisten the residue with 5 cc. of dilute nitric acid (sp.
gr. 1.2) and add 50 cc. of hot water. Filter off the meta-stannic acid, wash, ignite in porcelain
and weigh as SnO{2}. This oxide is never wholly free from copper and must be purified for an
exact determination. If it does not exceed 2 per cent of the alloy, the quantity of copper
which it contains may usually be neglected.]

[Note 3: The electrodes should be freed from all greasy matter before using, and those portions
upon which the metal will deposit should not be touched with the fingers after cleaning.]

[Note 4: Of the ions in solution, the H^{+}, Cu^{++}, Zn^{++}, and Fe^{+++} ions tend to move
toward the cathode. The NO{3}^{-} ions and the lead, probably in the form of PbO{2}^{--} ions,
move toward the anode. At the cathode the Cu^{++} ions are discharged and plate out as metallic
copper. This alone occurs while the solution is relatively concentrated. Later on, H^{+} ions
are also discharged. In the presence of considerable quantities of H^{+} ions, as in this acid
solution, no Zn^{++} or Fe^{+++} ions are discharged because of their greater deposition potentials.
At the anode the lead is deposited as PbO{2} and oxygen is evolved.

For the reasons stated on page 141 care must be taken that the solution does not become alkaline
if the electrolysis is long continued.]

[Note 5: Urea reacts with nitrous acid, which may be formed in the solution as a result of
the reducing action of the liberated hydrogen. Its removal promotes the complete precipitation
of the copper. The reaction is

CO(NH{2}){2} + 2HNO{2} --> CO{2} + 2N{2} + 3H{2}O.]

[Note 6: The electrodes must be washed nearly or quite free from the nitric acid solution before
the circuit is broken to prevent re-solution of the copper.

If several solutions are connected in the same circuit it is obvious that some device must
be used to close the circuit as soon as the beaker is removed.]

[Note 7: The electrodes upon which the copper has been deposited may be cleaned by immersion
in warm nitric acid. To remove the lead dioxide, add a few crystals of oxalic acid to the nitric
acid.]

DETERMINATION OF IRON

Most brasses contain small percentages of iron (usually not over 0.1 per cent) which, unless
removed, is precipitated as phosphate and weighed with the zinc.

PROCEDURE.--To the solution from the precipitation of copper and lead by electrolysis, add
dilute ammonia (sp. gr. 0.96) until the precipitate of zinc hydroxide which first forms re-dissolves,
leaving only a slight red precipitate of ferric hydroxide. Filter off the iron precipitate,
using a washed filter, and wash five times with hot water. Test a portion of the last washing
with a dilute solution of ammonium sulphide to assure complete removal of the zinc.

The precipitate may then be ignited and weighed as ferric oxide, as described on page 110.

Calculate the percentage of iron (Fe) in the brass.

DETERMINATION OF ZINC

PROCEDURE.--Acidify the filtrate from the iron determination with dilute nitric acid. Concentrate
it to 150 cc. Add to the cold solution dilute ammonia (sp. gr. 0.96) cautiously until it barely
smells of ammonia; then add !one drop! of a dilute solution of litmus (Note 1), and drop in,
with the aid of a dropper, dilute nitric acid until the blue of the litmus just changes to
red. It is important that this point should not be overstepped. Heat the solution nearly to
boiling and pour into it slowly a filtered solution of di-ammonium hydrogen phosphate[1] containing
a weight of the phosphate about equal to twelve times that of the zinc to be precipitated.
(For this calculation the approximate percentage of zinc is that found by subtracting the sum
of the percentages of the copper, lead and iron from 100 per cent.) Keep the solution just
below boiling for fifteen minutes, stirring frequently (Note 2). If at the end of this time
the amorphous precipitate has become crystalline, allow the solution to cool for about four
hours, although a longer time does no harm (Note 3), and filter upon an asbestos filter in
a porcelain Gooch crucible. The filter is prepared as described on page 103, and should be
dried to constant weight at 105°C.

[Footnote 1: The ammonium phosphate which is commonly obtainable contains some mono-ammonium
salt, and this is not satisfactory as a precipitant. It is advisable, therefore, to weigh out
the amount of the salt required, dissolve it in a small volume of water, add a drop of phenolphthalein
solution, and finally add dilute ammonium hydroxide solution cautiously until the solution
just becomes pink, but do not add an excess.]

Wash the precipitate until free from sulphates with a warm 1 per cent solution of the di-ammonium
phosphate, and then five times with 50 per cent alcohol (Note 4). Dry the crucible and precipitate
for an hour at 105°C., and finally to constant weight (Note 5). The filtrate should be made
alkaline with ammonia and tested for zinc with a few drops of ammonium sulphide, allowing it
to stand (Notes 6, 7 and 8).

From the weight of the zinc ammonium phosphate (ZnNH{4}PO{4}) calculate the percentage of the
zinc (Zn) in the brass.

[Note 1: The zinc ammonium phosphate is soluble both in acids and in ammonia. It is, therefore,
necessary to precipitate the zinc in a nearly neutral solution, which is more accurately obtained
by adding a drop of a litmus solution to the liquid than by the use of litmus paper.]

[Note 2: The precipitate which first forms is amorphous, and may have a variable composition.
On standing it becomes crystalline and then has the composition ZnNH{4}PO{4}. The precipitate
then settles rapidly and is apt to occasion "bumping" if the solution is heated to boiling.
Stirring promotes the crystallization.]

[Note 3: In a carefully neutralized solution containing a considerable excess of the precipitant,
and also ammonium salts, the separation of the zinc is complete after standing four hours.
The ionic changes connected with the precipitation of the zinc as zinc ammonium phosphate are
similar to those described for magnesium ammonium phosphate, except that the zinc precipitate
is soluble in an excess of ammonium hydroxide, probably as a result of the formation of complex
ions of the general character Zn(NH{3}){4}^{++}.]

[Note 4: The precipitate is washed first with a dilute solution of the phosphate to prevent
a slight decomposition of the precipitate (as a result of hydrolysis) if hot water alone is
used. The alcohol is added to the final wash-water to promote the subsequent drying.]

[Note 5: The precipitate may be ignited and weighed as Zn{2}P{2}O{7}, by cautiously heating
the porcelain Gooch crucible within a nickel or iron crucible, used as a radiator. The heating
must be very slow at first, as the escaping ammonia may reduce the precipitate if it is heated
too quickly.]

[Note 6: If the ammonium sulphide produced a distinct precipitate, this should be collected
on a small filter, dissolved in a few cubic centimeters of dilute nitric acid, and the zinc
reprecipitated as phosphate, filtered off, dried, and weighed, and the weight added to that
of the main precipitate.]

[Note 7: It has been found that some samples of asbestos are acted upon by the phosphate solution
and lose weight. An error from this source may be avoided by determining the weight of the
crucible and filter after weighing the precipitate. For this purpose the precipitate may be
dissolved in dilute nitric acid, the asbestos washed thoroughly, and the crucible reweighed.]

[Note 8. The details of this method of precipitation of zinc are fully discussed in an article
by Dakin, !Ztschr. Anal. Chem.!, 39 (1900), 273.]

DETERMINATION OF SILICA IN SILICATES

Of the natural silicates, or artificial silicates such as slags and some of the cements, a
comparatively few can be completely decomposed by treatment with acids, but by far the larger
number require fusion with an alkaline flux to effect decomposition and solution for analysis.
The procedure given below applies to silicates undecomposable by acids, of which the mineral
feldspar is taken as a typical example. Modifications of the procedure, which are applicable
to silicates which are completely or partially decomposable by acids, are given in the Notes
on page 155.

PREPARATION OF THE SAMPLE

Grind about 3 grams of the mineral in an agate mortar (Note 1) until no grittiness is to be
detected, or, better, until it will entirely pass through a sieve made of fine silk bolting
cloth. The sieve may be made by placing a piece of the bolting cloth over the top of a small
beaker in which the ground mineral is placed, holding the cloth in place by means of a rubber
band below the lip of the beaker. By inverting the beaker over clean paper and gently tapping
it, the fine particles pass through the sieve, leaving the coarser particles within the beaker.
These must be returned to the mortar and ground, and the process of sifting and grinding repeated
until the entire sample passes through the sieve.

[Note 1: If the sample of feldspar for analysis is in the massive or crystalline form, it should
be crushed in an iron mortar until the pieces are about half the size of a pea, and then transferred
to a steel mortar, in which they are reduced to a coarse powder. A wooden mallet should always
be used to strike the pestle of the steel mortar, and the blows should not be sharp.

It is plain that final grinding in an agate mortar must be continued until the whole of the
portion of the mineral originally taken has been ground so that it will pass the bolting cloth,
otherwise the sifted portion does not represent an average sample, the softer ingredients,
if foreign matter is present, being first reduced to powder. For this reason it is best to
start with not more than the quantity of the feldspar needed for analysis. The mineral must
be thoroughly mixed after the grinding.]

FUSION AND SOLUTION

PROCEDURE.--Weigh into platinum crucibles two portions of the ground feldspar of about 0.8
gram each. Weigh on rough balances two portions of anhydrous sodium carbonate, each amounting
to about six times the weight of the feldspar taken for analysis (Note 1). Pour about three
fourths of the sodium carbonate into the crucible, place the latter on a piece of clean, glazed
paper, and thoroughly mix the substance and the flux by carefully stirring for several minutes
with a dry glass rod, the end of which has been recently heated and rounded in a flame and
slowly cooled. The rod may be wiped off with a small fragment of filter paper, which may be
placed in the crucible. Place the remaining fourth of the carbonate on the top of the mixture.
Cover the crucible, heat it to dull redness for five minutes, and then gradually increase the
heat to the full capacity of a Bunsen or Tirrill burner for twenty minutes, or until a quiet,
liquid fusion is obtained (Note 2). Finally, heat the sides and cover strongly until any material
which may have collected upon them is also brought to fusion.

Allow the crucible to cool, and remove the fused mass as directed on page 116. Clean the crucible
and lid by means of a little hydrochloric acid, adding this acid to the main solution (Notes
4 and 5).

[Note 1: Quartz, and minerals containing very high percentages of silica, may require eight
or ten parts by weight of the flux to insure a satisfactory decomposition.]

[Note 2: During the fusion the feldspar, which, when pure, is a silicate of aluminium and either
sodium or potassium, but usually contains some iron, calcium, and magnesium, is decomposed
by the alkaline flux. The sodium of the latter combines with the silicic acid of the silicate,
with the evolution of carbon dioxide, while about two thirds of the aluminium forms sodium
aluminate and the remainder is converted into basic carbonate, or the oxide. The calcium and
magnesium, if present, are changed to carbonates or oxides.

The heat is applied gently to prevent a too violent reaction when fusion first takes place.]

[Note 3: The solution of a silicate by a strong acid is the result of the combination of the
H^{+} ions of the acid and the silicate ions of the silicate to form a slightly ionized silicic
acid. As a consequence, the concentration of the silicate ions in the solution is reduced nearly
to zero, and more silicate dissolves to re-establish the disturbed equilibrium. This process
repeats itself until all of the silicate is brought into solution.

Whether the resulting solution of the silicate contains ortho-silicic acid (H{4}SiO{4}) or
whether it is a colloidal solution of some other less hydrated acid, such as meta-silicic acid
(H{2}SiO{3}), is a matter that is still debatable. It is certain, however, that the gelatinous
material which readily separates from such solutions is of the nature of a hydrogel, that is,
a colloid which is insoluble in water. This substance when heated to 100°C., or higher, is
completely dehydrated, leaving only the anhydride, SiO{2}. The changes may be represented by
the equation:

SiO{3}^{--} + 2H^{+} --> [H{2}SiO{3}] --> H{2}O + SiO{2}.]

[Note 4: A portion of the fused mass is usually projected upward by the escaping carbon dioxide
during the fusion. The crucible must therefore be kept covered as much as possible and the
lid carefully cleaned.]

[Note 5: A gritty residue remaining after the disintegration of the fused mass by acid indicates
that the substance has been but imperfectly decomposed. Such a residue should be filtered,
washed, dried, ignited, and again fused with the alkaline flux; or, if the quantity of material
at hand will permit, it is better to reject the analysis, and to use increased care in grinding
the mineral and in mixing it with the flux.]

DEHYDRATION AND FILTRATION

PROCEDURE.--Evaporate the solution of the fusion to dryness, stirring frequently until the
residue is a dry powder. Moisten the residue with 5 cc. of strong hydrochloric acid (sp. gr.
1.20) and evaporate again to dryness. Heat the residue for at least one hour at a temperature
of 110°C. (Note 1). Again moisten the residue with concentrated hydrochloric acid, warm gently,
making sure that the acid comes into contact with the whole of the residue, dilute to about
200 cc. and bring to boiling. Filter off the silica without much delay (Note 2), and wash five
times with warm dilute hydrochloric acid (one part dilute acid (1.12 sp. gr.) to three parts
of water). Allow the filter to drain for a few moments, then place a clean beaker below the
funnel and wash with water until free from chlorides, discarding these washings. Evaporate
the original filtrate to dryness, dehydrate at 110°C. for one hour (Note 3), and proceed as
before, using a second filter to collect the silica after the second dehydration. Wash this
filter with warm, dilute hydrochloric acid (Note 4), and finally with hot water until free
from chlorides.

[Note 1: The silicic acid must be freed from its combination with a base (sodium, in this instance)
before it can be dehydrated. The excess of hydrochloric acid accomplishes this liberation.
By disintegrating the fused mass with a considerable volume of dilute acid the silicic acid
is at first held in solution to a large extent. Immediate treatment of the fused mass with
strong acid is likely to cause a semi-gelatinous silicic acid to separate at once and to inclose
alkali salts or alumina.

A flocculent residue will often remain after the decomposition of the fused mass is effected.
This is usually partially dehydrated silicic acid and does not require further treatment at
this point. The progress of the dehydration is indicated by the behavior of the solution, which
as evaporation proceeds usually gelatinizes. On this account it is necessary to allow the solution
to evaporate on a steam bath, or to stir it vigorously, to avoid loss by spattering.]

[Note 2: To obtain an approximately pure silica, the residue after evaporation must be thoroughly
extracted by warming with hydrochloric acid, and the solution freely diluted to prevent, as
far as possible, the inclosure of the residual salts in the particles of silica. The filtration
should take place without delay, as the dehydrated silica slowly dissolves in hydrochloric
acid on standing.]

[Note 3: It has been shown by Hillebrand that silicic acid cannot be completely dehydrated
by a single evaporation and heating, nor by several such treatments, unless an intermediate
filtration of the silica occurs. If, however, the silica is removed and the filtrates are again
evaporated and the residue heated, the amount of silica remaining in solution is usually negligible,
although several evaporations and filtrations are required with some silicates to insure absolute
accuracy.

It is probable that temperatures above 100°C. are not absolutely necessary to dehydrate the
silica; but it is recommended, as tending to leave the silica in a better condition for filtration
than when the lower temperature of the water bath is used. This, and many other points in the
analysis of silicates, are fully discussed by Dr. Hillebrand in the admirable monograph on
"The Analysis of Silicate and Carbonate Rocks," Bulletin No. 700 of the United States Geological
Survey.

The double evaporation and filtration spoken of above are essential because of the relatively
large amount of alkali salts (sodium chloride) present after evaporation. For the highest accuracy
in the determination of silica, or of iron and alumina, it is also necessary to examine for
silica the precipitate produced in the filtrate by ammonium hydroxide by fusing it with acid
potassium sulphate and solution of the fused mass in water. The insoluble silica is filtered,
washed, and weighed, and the weight added to the weight of silica previously obtained.]

[Note 4: Aluminium and iron are likely to be thrown down as basic salts from hot, very dilute
solutions of their chlorides, as a result of hydrolysis. If the silica were washed only with
hot water, the solution of these chlorides remaining in the filter after the passage of the
original filtrate would gradually become so dilute as to throw down basic salts within the
pores of the filter, which would remain with the silica. To avoid this, an acid wash-water
is used until the aluminium and iron are practically removed. The acid is then removed by water.]

IGNITION AND TESTING OF SILICA

PROCEDURE.--Transfer the two washed filters belonging to each determination to a platinum crucible,
which need not be previously weighed, and burn off the filter (Note 1). Ignite for thirty minutes
over the blast lamp with the cover on the crucible, and then for periods of ten minutes, until
the weight is constant.

When a constant weight has been obtained, pour into the crucible about 3 cc. of water, and
then 3 cc. of hydrofluoric acid. !This must be done in a hood with a good draft and great care
must be taken not to come into contact with the acid or to inhale its fumes (Note 2!).

If the precipitate has dissolved in this quantity of acid, add two drops of concentrated sulphuric
acid, and heat very slowly (always under the hood) until all the liquid has evaporated, finally
igniting to redness. Cool in a desiccator, and weigh the crucible and residue. Deduct this
weight from the previous weight of crucible and impure silica, and from the difference calculate
the percentage of silica in the sample (Note 3).

[Note 1: The silica undergoes no change during the ignition beyond the removal of all traces
of water; but Hillebrand (!loc. cit.!) has shown that the silica holds moisture so tenaciously
that prolonged ignition over the blast lamp is necessary to remove it entirely. This finely
divided, ignited silica tends to absorb moisture, and should be weighed quickly.]

[Note 2: Notwithstanding all precautions, the ignited precipitate of silica is rarely wholly
pure. It is tested by volatilisation of the silica as silicon fluoride after solution in hydrofluoric
acid, and, if the analysis has been properly conducted, the residue, after treatment with the
acids and ignition, should not exceed 1 mg.

The acid produces ulceration if brought into contact with the skin, and its fumes are excessively
harmful if inhaled.]

[Note 3: The impurities are probably weighed with the original precipitate in the form of oxides.
The addition of the sulphuric acid displaces the hydrofluoric acid, and it may be assumed that
the resulting sulphates (usually of iron or aluminium) are converted to oxides by the final
ignition.

It is obvious that unless the sulphuric and hydrofluoric acids used are known to leave no residue
on evaporation, a quantity equal to that employed in the analysis must be evaporated and a
correction applied for any residue found.]

[Note 4: If the silicate to be analyzed is shown by a previous qualitative examination to be
completely decomposable, it may be directly treated with hydrochloric acid, the solution evaporated
to dryness, and the silica dehydrated and further treated as described in the case of the feldspar
after fusion.

A silicate which gelatinizes on treatment with acids should be mixed first with a little water,
and the strong acid added in small portions with stirring, otherwise the gelatinous silicic
acid incloses particles of the original silicate and prevents decomposition. The water, by
separating the particles and slightly lessening the rapidity of action, prevents this difficulty.
This procedure is one which applies in general to the solution of fine mineral powders in acids.

If a small residue remains undecomposed by the treatment of the silicate with acid, this may
be filtered, washed, ignited and fused with sodium carbonate and a solution of the fused mass
added to the original acid solution. This double procedure has an advantage, in that it avoids
adding so large a quantity of sodium salts as is required for disintegration of the whole of
the silicate by the fusion method.]

PART IV

STOICHIOMETRY

The problems with which the analytical chemist has to deal are not, as a matter of actual fact,
difficult either to solve or to understand. That they appear difficult to many students is
due to the fact that, instead of understanding the principles which underlie each of the small
number of types into which these problems may be grouped, each problem is approached as an
individual puzzle, unrelated to others already solved or explained. This attitude of mind should
be carefully avoided.

It is obvious that ability to make the calculations necessary for the interpretation of analytical
data is no less important than the manipulative skill required to obtain them, and that a moderate
time spent in the careful study of the solutions of the typical problems which follow may save
much later embarrassment.

1. It is often necessary to calculate what is known as a "chemical factor," or its equivalent
logarithmic value called a "log factor," for the conversion of the weight of a given chemical
substance into an equivalent weight of another substance. This is, in reality, a very simple
problem in proportion, making use of the atomic or molecular weights of the substances in question
which are chemically equivalent to each other. One of the simplest cases of this sort is the
following: What is the factor for the conversion of a given weight of barium sulphate (BaSO{4})
into an equivalent weight of sulphur (S)? The molecular weight of BaSO{4} is 233.5. There is
one atom of S in the molecule and the atomic weight of S is 32.1. The chemical factor is, therefore,
32.1/233.5, or 0.1375 and the weight of S corresponding to a given weight of BaSO{4} is found
by multiplying the weight of BaSO{4} by this factor. If the problem takes the form, "What is
the factor for the conversion of a given weight of ferric oxide (Fe{2}O{3}) into ferrous oxide
(FeO), or of a given weight of mangano-manganic oxide (Mn{3}O{4}) into manganese (Mn)?" the
principle involved is the same, but it must then be noted that, in the first instance, each
molecule of Fe{2}O{3} will be equivalent to two molecules of FeO, and in the second instance
that each molecule of Mn{3}O{4} is equivalent to three atoms of Mn. The respective factors
then become

(2FeO/Fe{2}O{3}) or (143.6/159.6) and (3Mn/Mn{3}O{4}) or (164.7/228.7).

It is obvious that the arithmetical processes involved in this type of problem are extremely
simple. It is only necessary to observe carefully the chemical equivalents. It is plainly incorrect
to express the ratio of ferrous to ferric oxide as (FeO/Fe{2}O{3}), since each molecule of
the ferric oxide will yield two molecules of the ferrous oxide. Mistakes of this sort are easily
made and constitute one of the most frequent sources of error.

2. A type of problem which is slightly more complicated in appearance, but exactly comparable
in principle, is the following: "What is the factor for the conversion of a given weight of
ferrous sulphate (FeSO{4}), used as a reducing agent against potassium permanganate, into the
equivalent weight of sodium oxalate (Na{2}C{2}O{4})?" These molecular quantities are therefore
equivalent, and the factor becomes (10FeSO{4}/5Na{2}C{2}O{4}) or (2FeSO{4}/Na{2}C{2}O{4}) or
(303.8/134).

Again, let it be assumed that it is desired to determine the factor required for the conversion
of a given weight of potassium permanganate (KMnO{4}) into an equivalent weight of potassium
bichromate (K{2}Cr{2}O{7}), each acting as an oxidizing agent against ferrous sulphate. These
are not equivalent, but if the first equation is multiplied by 3 and the second by 5 the number
of molecules of FeSO{4} is then the same in both, and the number of molecules of KMnO{4} and
K{2}Cr{2}O{7} reacting with these 30 molecules become 6 and 5 respectively. These are obviously
chemically equivalent and the desired factor is expressed by the fraction (6KMnO{4}/5K{2}Cr{2}O{7})
or (948.0/1471.0).

3. It is sometimes necessary to calculate the value of solutions according to the principles
just explained, when several successive reactions are involved. Such problems may be solved
by a series of proportions, but it is usually possible to eliminate the common factors and
solve but a single one. For example, the amount of MnO{2} in a sample of the mineral pyrolusite
may be determined by dissolving the mineral in hydrochloric acid, absorbing the evolved chlorine
in a solution of potassium iodide, and measuring the liberated iodine by titration with a standard
solution of sodium thiosulphate. From the reactions given above, the following proportions
may be stated:

2Na{2}S{2}O{3}:I{2} = 316.4:253.9,

I{2}:Cl{2} = 253.9:71,

Cl{2}:MnO{2} = 71:86.9.

After canceling the common factors, there remains 2Na{2}S{2}O{3}:MnO{2} = 316.4:86.9, and the
factor for the conversion of thiosulphate into an equivalent of manganese dioxide is 86.9/316.4.

4. To calculate the volume of a reagent required for a specific operation, it is necessary
to know the exact reaction which is to be brought about, and, as with the calculation of factors,
to keep in mind the molecular relations between the reagent and the substance reacted upon.
For example, to estimate the weight of barium chloride necessary to precipitate the sulphur
from 0.1 gram of pure pyrite (FeS{2}), the proportion should read

       488.           120.0
  2(BaCl{2}.2H{2}O):FeS{2} = x:0.1,

where !x! represents the weight of the chloride required. Each of the two atoms of sulphur
will form upon oxidation a molecule of sulphuric acid or a sulphate, which, in turn, will require
a molecule of the barium chloride for precipitation. To determine the quantity of the barium
chloride required, it is necessary to include in its molecular weight the water of crystallization,
since this is inseparable from the chloride when it is weighed. This applies equally to other
similar instances.

If the strength of an acid is expressed in percentage by weight, due regard must be paid to
its specific gravity. For example, hydrochloric acid (sp. gr. 1.12) contains 23.8 per cent
HCl !by weight!; that is, 0.2666 gram HCl in each cubic centimeter.

5. It is sometimes desirable to avoid the manipulation required for the separation of the constituents
of a mixture of substances by making what is called an "indirect analysis." For example, in
the analysis of silicate rocks, the sodium and potassium present may be obtained in the form
of their chlorides and weighed together. If the weight of such a mixture is known, and also
the percentage of chlorine present, it is possible to calculate the amount of each chloride
in the mixture. Let it be assumed that the weight of the mixed chlorides is 0.15 gram, and
that it contains 53 per cent of chlorine.

The simplest solution of such a problem is reached through algebraic methods. The weight of
chlorine is evidently 0.15 x 0.53, or 0.0795 gram. Let x represent the weight of sodium chloride
present and y that of potassium chloride. The molecular weight of NaCl is 58.5 and that of
KCl is 74.6. The atomic weight of chlorine is 35.5. Then

x + y = 0.15 (35.5/58.5)x + (35.5/74.6)y = 0.00795

Solving these equations for x shows the weight of NaCl to be 0.0625 gram. The weight of KCl
is found by subtracting this from 0.15.

The above is one of the most common types of indirect analyses. Others are more complex but
they can be reduced to algebraic expressions and solved by their aid. It should, however, be
noted that the results obtained by these indirect methods cannot be depended upon for high
accuracy, since slight errors in the determination of the common constituent, as chlorine in
the above mixture, will cause considerable variations in the values found for the components.
They should not be employed when direct methods are applicable, if accuracy is essential.

PROBLEMS

(The reactions necessary for the solution of these problems are either stated with the problem
or may be found in the earlier text. In the calculations from which the answers are derived,
the atomic weights given on page 195 have been employed, using, however, only the first decimal
but increasing this by 1 when the second decimal is 5 or above. Thus, 39.1 has been taken as
the atomic weight of potassium, 32.1 for sulphur, etc. This has been done merely to secure
uniformity of treatment, and the student should remember that it is always well to take into
account the degree of accuracy desired in a particular instance in determining the number of
decimal places to retain. Four-place logarithms were employed in the calculations. Where four
figures are given in the answer, the last figure may vary by one or (rarely) by two units,
according to the method by which the problem is solved.)
