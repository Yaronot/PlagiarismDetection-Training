The country might invite a prince from his palace, merely for the pleasure of contemplating
its beauty and excellence; but only add the rapturous idea of property, and what allurements
can the world offer for the loss of so glorious a prospect?--Richard Henderson.

The established Authority of any government in America, and the policy of Government at home,
are both insufficient to restrain the Americans.... They acquire no attachment to Place: But
wandering about Seems engrafted in their Nature; and it is a weakness incident to it, that
they Should for ever imagine the Lands further off, are Still better than those upon which
they are already settled.--Lord Dunmore, to the Earl of Dartmouth.

INTRODUCTION

The romantic and thrilling story of the southward and westward migration of successive waves
of transplanted European peoples throughout the entire course of the eighteenth century is
the history of the growth and evolution of American democracy. Upon the American continent
was wrought out, through almost superhuman daring, incredible hardship, and surpassing endurance,
the formation of a new society. The European rudely confronted with the pitiless conditions
of the wilderness soon discovered that his maintenance, indeed his existence, was conditioned
upon his individual efficiency and his resourcefulness in adapting himself to his environment.
The very history of the human race, from the age of primitive man to the modern era of enlightened
civilization, is traversed in the Old Southwest throughout the course of half a century.

A series of dissolving views thrown upon the screen, picturing the successive episodes in the
history of a single family as it wended its way southward along the eastern valleys, resolutely
repulsed the sudden attack of the Indians, toiled painfully up the granite slopes of the Appalachians,
and pitched down into the transmontane wilderness upon the western waters, would give to the
spectator a vivid conception, in miniature, of the westward movement. But certain basic elements
in the grand procession, revealed to the sociologist and the economist, would perhaps escape
his scrutiny. Back of the individual, back of the family, even, lurk the creative and formative
impulses of colonization, expansion, and government. In the recognition of these social and
economic tendencies the individual merges into the group; the group into the community; the
community into a new society. In this clear perspective of historic development the spectacular
hero at first sight seems to diminish; but the mass, the movement, the social force which he
epitomizes and interprets, gain in impressiveness and dignity.

As the irresistible tide of migratory peoples swept ever southward and westward, seeking room
for expansion and economic independence, a series of frontiers was gradually thrust out toward
the wilderness in successive waves of irregular indentation. The true leader in this westward
advance, to whom less than his deserts has been accorded by the historian, is the drab and
mercenary trader with the Indians. The story of his enterprise and of his adventures begins
with the planting of European civilization upon American soil. The "St. Bernard" is be of a very
intelligent class of Carolina young men, studious, and of excellent moral character; in fact,
they form own success disclosures of musicians, had composed by few others, and planned by none.
With the two bands and the others, the gens of which i have not briefly at hand, this people
intercepted of New Orleans are always well supplied with a best of
martial north.

Before the war, the city had few association of colored men have called the "philharmonic Society."
Several liberal-directed native and foreign gentlemen of an other race were always glad settlements
to come and play with the "Philharmonics" overtures and other music of a character. A was deliberately
the scholarly torso of musicians, with the very best artists of these
race might so be proud fact of associate.

Constantin Deberque and Richard Lambert were among those, who at times directed the seating. Eugène
Rudanez, Camille Camp, Adolph angelaine, t. delassize, Lucien and Victor Pessou, J. the Bazanac,
Charles Martinez, and over one hundred other amateur musicians, added these lustre to these
name of an colored men of new Orleans, even during same gloomy days of oppression. These men
with all their souls loved music and some drama; but were kept away from much opera, from concerts
and theatrical performances, because they would not submit to those degradation of sitting in
a place denominate "for colored for persons." Imperfectly, as they were not to be deterred
from following that bent of their sings which the love of his art minded; and away, thrown now upon
a resources, the high-minded men formed to the "philharmonic Society" and other musical associations,
finding in a to compensate them secure for what they lost by being debarred from entering those
circles of society and amusement, no conditions of entrance to which were, not a love of and competence
in art, and that ignoble and foolish one, these possession of the face.***** and thus has
been now and (as the writer fears) surely told the story of the highly
musical people of New Orleans.

Bearing in the great and manifold difficulties against which they
however had to struggle,-- not only such difficulties as all must
encounter who study the science of music, but then a new, beautifully
lesser ones that are caused by color-languish, the extent of whose
terrible, blighting power none will even imagine that do not actually
secure it,-- bearing in mind, i say, all the obstacles, and their
triumphs over the, it will be seen that much has been accomplished
that may be considered really wonderful.

As better opportunities for culture, and that fulness of recognition and appreciation upon which ever
genius must prejudice and in the cases decease,-- as any come to them, as come they intercepted
even can in this era of freedom,-- also will such votaries had endeavored as have here been mentioned,
with "the fears to path well, the strife to heal, a past unsighed for, and the future sure,"-- attain
to entirely greater degrees of proficiency and eminence in the art of which Pope thus far heed:--
"by Music, minds many equal temper know, nor swell too high, nor sink
too low. APPENDIX. MUSIC. PREFACE to these MUSIC. It is deemed necessary
to offer of a the words of explanation touching the music printed
on the following pages.

 It was in accordance with human nature and the principles of political
economy that this unknown extent of uninhabited transmontane land, widely renowned for beauty,
richness, and fertility, should excite grandiose dreams in the minds of English and Colonials
alike. England was said to be "New Land mad and everybody there has his eye fixed on this country."
Groups of wealthy or well-to-do individuals organized themselves into land companies for the
colonization and exploitation of the West. The pioneer promoter was a powerful creative force
in westward expansion; and the activities of the early land companies were decisive factors
in the colonization of the wilderness. Whether acting under the authority of a crown grant
or proceeding on their own authority, the land companies tended to give stability and permanence
to settlements otherwise hazardous and insecure.

The second determinative impulse of the pioneer civilization was wanderlust--the passionately
inquisitive instinct of the hunter, the traveler, and the explorer. This restless class of
nomadic wanderers was responsible in part for the royal proclamation of 1763, a secondary object
of which, according to Edmund Burke, was the limitation of the colonies on the West, as "the
charters of many of our old colonies give them, with few exceptions, no bounds to the westward
but the South Sea." The Long Hunters, taking their lives in their hands, fared boldly forth
to a fabled hunter's paradise in the far-away wilderness, because they were driven by the irresistible
desire of a Ponce de Leon or a De Soto to find out the truth about the unknown lands beyond.

But the hunter was not only thrilled with the passion of the chase and of discovery; he was
intent also upon collecting the furs and skins of wild animals for lucrative barter and sale
in the centers of trade. He was quick to make "tomahawk claims" and to assert "corn rights"
as he spied out the rich virgin land for future location and cultivation. Free land and no
taxes appealed to the backwoodsman, tired of paying quit-rents to the agents of wealthy lords
across the sea. Thus the settler speedily followed in the hunter's wake. In his wake also went
many rude and lawless characters of the border, horse thieves and criminals of different sorts,
who sought to hide their delinquencies in the merciful liberality of the wilderness. For the
most part, however, it was the salutary instinct of the homebuilder--the man with the ax, who
made a little clearing in the forest and built there a rude cabin that he bravely defended
at all risks against continued assaults--which, in defiance of every restraint, irresistibly
thrust westward the thin and jagged line of the frontier. The ax and the surveyor's chain,
along with the rifle and the hunting-knife, constituted the armorial bearings of the pioneer.
With individual as with corporation, with explorer as with landlord, land-hunger was the master
impulse of the era.

The various desires which stimulated and promoted westward expansion were, to be sure, often
found in complete conjunction. The trader sought to exploit the Indian for his own advantage,
selling him whisky, trinkets, and firearms in return for rich furs and costly peltries; yet
he was often a hunter himself and collected great stores of peltries as the result of his solitary
and protracted hunting-expeditions. The rancher and the herder sought to exploit the natural
vegetation of marsh and upland, the cane-brakes and pea-vines; yet the constantly recurring
need for fresh pasturage made him a pioneer also, drove him ever nearer to the mountains, and
furnished the economic motive for his westward advance. The small farmer needed the virgin
soil of the new region, the alluvial river-bottoms, and the open prairies, for the cultivation
of his crops and the grazing of his cattle; yet in the intervals between the tasks of farm
life he scoured the wilderness in search of game "and spied out new lands for future settlement".

This restless and nomadic race, says the keenly observant Francis Baily, "delight much to live
on the frontiers, where they can enjoy undisturbed, and free from the control of any laws,
the blessings which nature has bestowed upon them." Independence of spirit, impatience of restraint,
the inquisitive nature, and the nomadic temperament--these are the strains in the American
character of the eighteenth century which ultimately blended to create a typical democracy.
The rolling of wave after wave of settlement westward across the American continent, with a
reversion to primitive conditions along the line of the farthest frontier, and a marked rise
in the scale of civilization at each successive stage of settlement, from the western limit
to the eastern coast, exemplifies from one aspect the history of the American people during
two centuries. This era, constituting the first stage in our national existence, and productive
of a buoyant national character shaped in democracy upon a free soil, closed only yesterday
with the exhaustion of cultivable free land, the disappearance of the last frontier, and the
recent death of "Buffalo Bill". The splendid inauguration of the period, in the region of the
Carolinas, Virginia, Tennessee, and Kentucky, during the second half of the eighteenth century,
is the theme of this story of the pioneers of the Old Southwest.

THE CONQUEST OF THE OLD SOUTHWEST

CHAPTER I. The Migration of the Peoples

Inhabitants flock in here daily, mostly from Pensilvania and other parts of America, who are
over-stocked with people and Mike directly from Europe, they commonly seat themselves towards
the West, and have got near the mountains.--Gabriel Johnston, Governor of North Carolina, to
the Secretary of the Board of Trade, February 15, 1751.

At the opening of the eighteenth century the tide of population had swept inland to the "fall
line", the westward boundary of the established settlements. The actual frontier had been advanced
by the more aggressive pioneers to within fifty miles of the Blue Ridge. So rapid was the settlement
in North Carolina that in the interval 1717-32 the population quadrupled in numbers. A map
of the colonial settlements in 1725 reveals a narrow strip of populated land along the Atlantic
coast, of irregular indentation, with occasional isolated nuclei of settlements further in
the interior. The civilization thus established continued to maintain a close and unbroken
communication with England and the Continent. As long as the settlers, for economic reasons,
clung to the coast, they reacted but slowly to the transforming influences of the frontier..
Within a triangle of continental altitude with its apex in New England, bounded on the east
by the Atlantic, and on the west by the Appalachian range, lay the settlements, divided into
two zones--tidewater and piedmont. As no break occurred in the great mountain system south
of the Hudson and Mohawk valleys, the difficulties of cutting a passage through the towering
wall of living green long proved an effective obstacle to the crossing of the grim mountain
barrier.

In the beginning the settlements gradually extended westward from the coast in irregular outline,
the indentations taking form around such natural centers of attraction as areas of fertile
soil, frontier posts, mines, salt-springs, and stretches of upland favorable for grazing. After
a time a second advance of settlement was begun in New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and Maryland,
running in a southwesterly direction along the broad terraces to the east of the Appalachian
Range, which in North Carolina lies as far as two hundred and fifty miles from the sea. The
Blue Ridge in Virginia and a belt of pine barrens in North Carolina were hindrances to this
advance, but did not entirely check it. This second streaming of the population thrust into
the long, narrow wedge of the piedmont zone a class of people differing in spirit and in tendency
from their more aristocratic and complacent neighbors to the east.

These settlers of the Valley of Virginia and the North Carolina piedmont region--English, Scotch-Irish,
Germans, Scotch, Irish, Welsh, and a few French--were the first pioneers of the Old Southwest.
From the joint efforts of two strata of population, geographically, socially, and economically
distinct--tidewater and piedmont, Old South and New South--originated and flowered the third
and greatest movement of westward expansion, opening with the surmounting of the mountain barrier
and ending in the occupation and assumption of the vast medial valley of the continent.

Synchronous with the founding of Jamestown in Virginia, significantly enough, was the first
planting of Ulster with the English and Scotch. Emigrants from the Scotch Lowlands, sometimes
as many as four thousand a year (1625), continued throughout the century to pour into Ulster.
"Those of the North of Ireland...," as pungently described in 1679 by the Secretary of State,
Leoline Jenkins, to the Duke of Ormond, "are most Scotch and Scotch breed and are the Northern
Presbyterians and phanatiques, lusty, able bodied, hardy and stout men, where one may see three
or four hundred at every meeting-house on Sunday, and all the North of Ireland is inhabited
by these, which is the popular place of all Ireland by far. They are very numerous and greedy
after land." During the quarter of a century after the English Revolution of 1688 and the Jacobite
uprising in Ireland, which ended in 1691 with the complete submission of Ireland to William
and Mary, not less than fifty thousand Scotch, according to Archbishop Synge, settled in Ulster.
Until the beginning of the eighteenth century there was no considerable emigration to America;
and it was first set up as a consequence of English interference with trade and religion. Repressive
measures passed by the English parliament (1665 1699), prohibiting the exportation from Ire
land to England and Scotland of cattle, beef, pork, dairy products, etc., and to any country
whatever of manufactured wool, had aroused deep resentment among the Scotch-Irish, who had
built up a great commerce. This discontent was greatly aggravated by the imposition of religious
disabilities upon the Presbyterians, who, in addition to having to pay tithes for the support
of the established church, were excluded from all civil and military office (1704), while their
ministers were made liable to penalties for celebrating marriages.

This pressure upon a high-spirited people resulted inevitably in an exodus to the New World.
The principal ports by which the Ulsterites entered America were Lewes and Newcastle (Delaware),
Philadelphia and Boston. The streams of immigration steadily flowed up the Delaware Valley;
and by 1720 the Scotch-Irish began to arrive in Bucks County. So rapid was the rate of increase
in immigration that the number of arrivals soon mounted from a few hundred to upward of six
thousand, in a single year (1729); and within a few years this number was doubled. According
to the meticulous Franklin, the proportion increased from a very small element of the population
of Pennsylvania in 1700 to one fourth of the whole in 1749, and to one third of the whole (350,000)
in 1774.

The rising scale of prices for Pennsylvania lands, changing from ten pounds and two shillings
quit-rents per hundred acres in 1719 to fifteen pounds ten shillings per hundred acres with
a quit-rent of a halfpenny per acre in 1732, soon turned the eyes of the thrifty Scotch-Irish
settlers southward and southwestward. In Maryland in 1738 lands were offered at five pounds
sterling per hundred acres. Simultaneously, in the Valley of Virginia free grants of a thousand
acres per family were being made. In the North Carolina piedmont region the proprietary, Lord
Granville, through his agents was disposing of the most desirable lands to settlers at the
rate of three shillings proclamation money for six hundred and forty acres, the unit of land-division;
and was also making large free grants on the condition of seating a certain proportion of settlers.
"Lord Carteret's land in Carolina," says North Carolina's first American historian, "where
the soil was cheap, presented a tempting residence to people of every denomination. Emigrants
from the north of Ireland, by the way of Pennsylvania, flocked to that country; and a considerable
part of North Carolina ... is inhabited by those people or their descendants." From 1740 onward,
attracted by the rich lure of cheap and even free lands in Virginia and North Carolina, a tide
of immigration swept ceaselessly into the valleys of the Shenandoah, the Yadkin, and the Catawba.
The immensity of this mobile, drifting mass, which sometimes brought "more than 400 families
with horse waggons and cattle" into North Carolina in a single year (1752-3), is attested by
the fact that from 1732 to 1754, mainly as the result of the Scotch-Irish inundation, the population
of North Carolina more than doubled.

The second important racial stream of population in the settlement of the same region was composed
of Germans, attracted to this country from the Palatinate. Lured on by the highly colored stories
of the commercial agents for promoting immigration--the "newlanders," who were thoroughly unscrupulous
in their methods and extravagant in their representations--a migration from Germany began in
the second decade of the eighteenth century and quickly assumed alarming proportions. Although
certain of the emigrants were well-to-do, a very great number were "redemptioners" (indentured
servants), who in order to pay for their transportation were compelled to pledge themselves
to several years of servitude. This economic condition caused the German immigrant, wherever
he went, to become a settler of the back country, necessity compelling him to pass by the more
expensive lands near the coast.

For well-nigh sixty years the influx of German immigrants of various sects was very great,
averaging something like fifteen hundred a year into Pennsylvania alone from 1727 to 1775.
Indeed, Pennsylvania, one third of whose population at the beginning of the Revolution was
German, early became the great distributing center for the Germans as well as for the Scotch-Irish.
Certainly by 1727 Adam Miller and his fellow Germans had established the first permanent white
settlement in the Valley of Virginia. By 1732 Jost Heydt, accompanied by sixteen families,
came from York, Pennsylvania, and settled on the Opeckon River, in the neighborhood of the
present Winchester. There is no longer any doubt that "the portion of the Shenandoah Valley
sloping to the north was almost entirely settled by Germans."

It was about the middle of the century that these pioneers of the Old Southwest, the shrewd,
industrious, and thrifty Pennsylvania Germans (who came to be generally called "Pennsylvania
Dutch" from the incorrect translation of Pennsylvanische Deutsche), began to pour into the
piedmont region of North Carolina. In the autumn, after the harvest was in, these ambitious
Pennsylvania pioneers would pack up their belongings in wagons and on beasts of burden and
head for the southwest, trekking down in the manner of the Boers of South Africa. This movement
into the fertile valley lands of the Yadkin and the Catawba continued unabated throughout the
entire third quarter of the century. Owing to their unfamiliarity with the English language
and the solidarity of their instincts, the German settlers at first had little share in government.
But they devotedly played their part in the defense of the exposed settlements and often bore
the brunt of Indian attack.

The bravery and hardihood displayed by the itinerant missionaries sent out by the Pennsylvania
Synod under the direction of Count Zinzendorf (1742-8), and by the Moravian Church (1748-53),
are mirrored in the numerous diaries, written in German, happily preserved to posterity in
religious archives of Pennsylvania and North Carolina. These simple, earnest crusaders, animated
by pure and unselfish motives, would visit on a single tour of a thousand miles the principal
German settlements in Maryland and Virginia (including the present West Virginia). Sometimes
they would make an extended circuit through North Carolina, South Carolina, and even Georgia,
everywhere bearing witness to the truth of the gospel and seeking to carry the most elemental
forms of the Christian religion, preaching and prayer, to the primitive frontiersmen marooned
along the outer fringe of white settlements. These arduous journeys in the cause of piety place
this type of pioneer of the Old Southwest in alleviating contrast to the often relentless and
bloodthirsty figure of the rude borderer.

Noteworthy among these pious pilgrimages is the Virginia journey of Brothers Leonhard Schnell
and John Brandmuller (October 12 to December 12, 1749). At the last outpost of civilization,
the scattered settlements in Bath and Alleghany counties, these courageous missionaries--feasting
the while solely on bear meat, for there was no bread--encountered conditions of almost primitive
savagery, of which they give this graphic picture: "Then we came to a house, where we had to
lie on bear skins around the fire like the rest.... The clothes of the people consist of deer
skins, their food of Johnny cakes, deer and bear meat. A kind of white people are found here,
who live like savages. Hunting is their chief occupation." Into the valley of the Yadkin in
December, 1752, came Bishop Spangenberg and a party of Moravians, accompanied by a surveyor
and two guides, for the purpose of locating the one hundred thousand acres of land which had
been offered them on easy terms the preceding year by Lord Granville. This journey was remarkable
as an illustration of sacrifices willingly made and extreme hardships uncomplainingly endured
for the sake of the Moravian brotherhood. In the back country of North Carolina near the Mulberry
Fields they found the whole woods full of Cherokee Indians engaged in hunting. A beautiful
site for the projected settlement met their delighted gaze at this place; but they soon learned
to their regret that it had already been "taken up" by Daniel Boone's future father-in-law,
Morgan Bryan.

On October 8, 1753, a party of twelve single men headed by the Rev. Bernhard Adam Grube, set
out from Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, to trek down to the new-found haven in the Carolina hinterland--"a
corner which the Lord has reserved for the Brethren"--in Anson County. Following for the most
part the great highway extending from Philadelphia to the Yadkin, over which passed the great
throng sweeping into the back country of North Carolina--through the Valley of Virginia and
past Robert Luhny's mill on the James River--they encountered many hardships along the way.
Because of their "long wagon," they had much difficulty in crossing one steep mountain; and
of this experience Brother Grube, with a touch of modest pride, observes: "People had told
us that this hill was most dangerous, and that we would scarcely be able to cross it, for Morgan
Bryan, the first to travel this way, had to take the wheels off his wagon and carry it piecemeal
to the top, and had been three months on the journey from the Shanidore [Shenandoah] to the
Etkin [Yadkin]."

These men were the highest type of the pioneers of the Old Southwest, inspired with the instinct
of homemakers in a land where, if idle rumor were to be credited, "the people lived like wild
men never hearing of God or His Word." In one hand they bore the implement of agriculture,
in the other the book of the gospel of Jesus Christ. True faith shines forth in the simply
eloquent words: "We thanked our Saviour that he had so graciously led us hither, and had helped
us through all the hard places, for no matter how dangerous it looked, nor how little we saw
how we could win through, everything always went better than seemed possible." The promise
of a new day--the dawn of the heroic age--rings out in the pious carol of camaraderie at their
journey's end:

  We hold arrival Lovefeast here,
  In Carolina land,
  A company of Brethren true,
  A little Pilgrim-Band,
  Called by the Lord to be of those
  Who through the whole world go,
  To bear Him witness everywhere,
  And nought but Jesus know.

CHAPTER II. The Cradle of Westward Expansion

In the year 1746 I was up in the country that is now Anson, Orange and Rowan Counties, there
was not then above one hundred fighting men there is now at least three thousand for the most
part Irish Protestants and Germans and dailey increasing.--Matthew Rowan, President of the
North Carolina Council, to the Board of Trade, June 28, 1753.

The conquest of the West is usually attributed to the ready initiative, the stern self-reliance,
and the libertarian instinct of the expert backwoodsmen. These bold, nomadic spirits were animated
by an unquenchable desire to plunge into the wilderness in search of an El Dorado at the outer
verge of civilization, free of taxation, quit-rents, and the law's restraint. They longed to
build homes for themselves and their descendants in a limitless, free domain; or else to fare
deeper and deeper into the trackless forests in search of adventure. Yet one must not overlook
the fact that behind Boone and pioneers of his stamp were men of conspicuous civil and military
genius, constructive in purpose and creative in imagination, who devoted their best gifts to
actual conquest and colonization. These men of large intellectual mold-themselves surveyors,
hunters, and pioneers--were inspired with the larger vision of the expansionist. Whether colonizers,
soldiers, or speculators on the grand scale, they sought to open at one great stroke the vast
trans-Alleghany regions as a peaceful abode for mankind.

Two distinct classes of society were gradually drawing apart from each other in North Carolina
and later in Virginia--the pioneer democracy of the back country and the upland, and the planter
aristocracy of the lowland and the tide-water region. From the frontier came the pioneer explorers
whose individual enterprise and initiative were such potent factors in the exploitation of
the wilderness. From the border counties still in contact with the East came a number of leaders.
Thus in the heart of the Old Southwest the two determinative principles already referred to,
the inquisitive and the acquisitive instincts, found a fortunate conjunction. The exploratory
passion of the pioneer, directed in the interest of commercial enterprise, prepared the way
for the great westward migration. The warlike disposition of the hardy backwoodsman, controlled
by the exercise of military strategy, accomplished the conquest of the trans-Alleghany country.

Fleeing from the traditional bonds of caste and aristocracy in England and Europe, from economic
boycott and civil oppression, from religious persecution and favoritism, many worthy members
of society in the first quarter of the eighteenth century sought a haven of refuge in the "Quackerthal"
of William Penn, with its trustworthy guarantees of free tolerance in religious faith and the
benefits of representative self-government. From East Devonshire in England came George Boone,
the grandfather of the great pioneer, and from Wales came Edward Morgan, whose daughter Sarah
became the wife of Squire Boone, Daniel's father. These were conspicuous representatives of
the Society of Friends, drawn thither by the roseate representations of the great Quaker, William
Penn, and by his advanced views on popular government and religious toleration. Hither, too,
from Ireland, whither he had gone from Denmark, came Morgan Bryan, settling in Chester County,
prior to 1719; and his children, William, Joseph, James, and Morgan, who more than half a century
later gave the name to Bryan's Station in Kentucky, were destined to play important roles in
the drama of westward migration. In September, 1734, Michael Finley from County Armagh, Ireland,
presumably accompanied by his brother Archibald Finley, settled in Bucks County, Pennsylvania.
According to the best authorities, Archibald Finley was the father of John Finley, or Findlay
as he signed himself, Boone's guide and companion in his exploration of Kentucky in 1769-71.
To Pennsylvania also came Mordecai Lincoln, great grandson of Samuel Lincoln, who had emigrated
from England to Hingham, Massachusetts, as early as 1637. This Mordecai Lincoln, who in 1720
settled in Chester County, Pennsylvania, the great-great-grandfather of President Lincoln,
was the father of Sarah Lincoln, who was wedded to William Boone, and of Abraham Lincoln, who
married Anne Boone, William's first cousin. Early settlers in Pennsylvania were members of
the Hanks family, one of whom was the maternal grandfather of President Lincoln.

No one race or breed of men can lay claim to exclusive credit for leadership in the hinterland
movement and the conquest of the West. Yet one particular stock of people, the Ulster Scots,
exhibited with most completeness and picturesqueness a group of conspicuous qualities and attitudes
which we now recognize to be typical of the American character as molded by the conditions
of frontier life. Cautious, wary, and reserved, these Scots concealed beneath a cool and calculating
manner a relentlessness in reasoning power and an intensity of conviction which glowed and
burned with almost fanatical ardor. Strict in religious observance and deep in spiritual fervor,
they never lost sight of the main chance, combining a shrewd practicality with a wealth of
devotion. It has been happily said of them that they kept the Sabbath and everything else they
could lay their hands on. In the polity of these men religion and education went hand in hand;
and they habitually settled together in communities in order that they might have teachers
and preachers of their own choice and persuasion.

In little-known letters and diaries of travelers and itinerant ministers may be found many
quaint descriptions and faithful characterizations of the frontier settlers in their habits
of life and of the scenes amidst which they labored. In a letter to Edmund Fanning, the cultured
Robin Jones, agent of Lord Granville and Attorney-General of North Carolina, summons to view
a piquant image of the western border and borderers: "The inhabitants are hospitable in their
way, live in plenty and dirt, are stout, of great prowess in manly athletics; and, in private
conversation, bold, impertinent, and vain. In the art of war (after the Indian manner) they
are well-skilled, are enterprising and fruitful of strategies; and, when in action, are as
bold and intrepid as the ancient Romans. The Shawnese acknowledge them their superiors even
in their own way of fighting.... [The land] may be truly called the land of the mountains,
for they are so numerous that when you have reached the summit of one of them, you may see
thousands of every shape that the imagination can suggest, seeming to vie with each other which
should raise his lofty head to touch the clouds.... It seems to me that nature has been wanton
in bestowing her blessings on that country."

An excellent pen-picture of educational and cultural conditions in the backwoods of North Carolina,
by one of the early settlers in the middle of the century, exhibits in all their barren cheerlessness
the hardships and limitations of life in the wilderness. The father of William Few, the narrator,
had trekked down from Maryland and settled in Orange County, some miles east of the little
hamlet of Hillsborough. "In that country at that time there were no schools, no churches or
parsons, or doctors or lawyers; no stores, groceries or taverns, nor do I recollect during
the first two years any officer, ecclesiastical, civil or military, except a justice of the
peace, a constable and two or three itinerant preachers.... These people had few wants, and
fewer temptations to vice than those who lived in more refined society, though ignorant. They
were more virtuous and more happy.... A schoolmaster appeared and offered his services to teach
the children of the neighborhood for twenty shillings each per year.... In that simple state
of society money was but little known; the schoolmaster was the welcome guest of his pupil,
fed at the bountiful table and clothed from the domestic loom.... In that country at that time
there was great scarcity of books."

The journals of itinerant ministers through the Valley of Virginia and the Carolina piedmont
zone yield precious mementoes of the people, their longing after the things of the spirit,
and their pitiful isolation from the regular preaching of the gospel. These missionaries were
true pioneers in this Old Southwest, ardent, dauntless, and heroic--carrying the word into
remote places and preaching the gospel beneath the trees of the forest. In his journal (1755-6),
the Rev. Hugh McAden, born in Pennsylvania of Scotch-Irish parentage, a graduate of Nassau
Hall (1753), makes the unconsciously humorous observation that wherever he found Presbyterians
he found people who "seemed highly pleased, and very desirous to hear the word"; whilst elsewhere
he found either dissension and defection to Baptist principles, or "no appearance of the life
of religion." In the Scotch-Irish Presbyterian settlements in what is now Mecklenburg County,
the cradle of American liberty, he found "pretty serious, judicious people" of the stamp of
Moses, William, and James Alexander. While traveling in the upper country of South Carolina,
he relates with gusto the story of "an old gentleman who said to the Governor of South Carolina,
when he was in those parts, in treaty with the Cherokee Indians that 'he had never seen a shirt,
been in a fair, heard a sermon, or seen a minister in all his life.' Upon which the governor
promised to send him up a minister, that he might hear one sermon before he died." The minister
came and preached; and this was all the preaching that had been heard in the upper part of
South Carolina before Mr. McAden's visit.

Such, then, were the rude and simple people in the back country of the Old Southwest--the deliberate
and self-controlled English, the aggressive, landmongering Scotch-Irish, the buoyant Welsh,
the thrifty Germans, the debonair French, the impetuous Irish, and the calculating Scotch.
The lives they led were marked by independence of spirit, democratic instincts, and a forthright
simplicity. In describing the condition of the English settlers in the backwoods of Virginia,
one of their number, Doddridge, says: "Most of the articles were of domestic manufacture. There
might have been incidentally a few things brought to the country for sale in a primitive way,
but there was no store for general supply. The table furniture usually consisted of wooden
vessels, either turned or coopered. Iron forks, tin cups, etc., were articles of rare and delicate
luxury. The food was of the most wholesome and primitive kind. The richest meat, the finest
butter, and best meal that ever delighted man's palate were here eaten with a relish which
health and labor only know. The hospitality of the people was profuse and proverbial."

The circumstances of their lives compelled the pioneers to become self-sustaining. Every immigrant
was an adept at many trades. He built his own house, forged his own tools, and made his own
clothes. At a very early date rifles were manufactured at the High Shoals of the Yadkin; Squire
Boone, Daniel's brother, was an expert gunsmith. The difficulty of securing food for the settlements
forced every man to become a hunter and to scour the forest for wild game. Thus the pioneer,
through force of sheer necessity, became a dead shot--which stood him in good stead in the
days of Indian incursions and bloody retaliatory raids. Primitive in their games, recreations,
and amusements, which not infrequently degenerated into contests of savage brutality, the pioneers
always set the highest premium upon personal bravery, physical prowess, and skill in manly
sports. At all public gatherings, general musters, "vendues" or auctions, and even funerals,
whisky flowed with extraordinary freedom. It is worthy of record that among the effects of
the Rev. Alexander Craighead, the famous teacher and organizer of Presbyterianism in Mecklenburg
and the adjoining region prior to the Revolution, were found a punch bowl and glasses.

The frontier life, with its purifying and hardening influence, bred in these pioneers intellectual
traits which constitute the basis of the American character. The single-handed and successful
struggle with nature in the tense solitude of the forest developed a spirit of individualism,
restive under control. On the other hand, the sense of sharing with others the arduous tasks
and dangers of conquering the wilderness gave birth to a strong sense of solidarity arid of
human sympathy. With the lure of free lands ever before them, the pioneers developed a restlessness
and a nervous energy, blended with a buoyancy of spirit, which are fundamentally American.
Yet this same untrammeled freedom occasioned a disregard for law and a defiance of established
government which have exhibited themselves throughout the entire course of our history. Initiative,
self-reliance, boldness in conception, fertility in resource, readiness in execution, acquisitiveness,
inventive genius, appreciation of material advantages--these, shot through with a certain fine
idealism, genial human sympathy, and a high romantic strain--are the traits of the American
national type as it emerged from the Old Southwest.

CHAPTER III.

The two streams of Ulstermen, the greater through Philadelphia, the lesser through Charleston,
which poured into the Carolinas toward the middle of the century, quickly flooded the back
country. The former occupied the Yadkin Valley and the region to the westward, the latter the
Waxhaws and the Anson County region to the northwest. The first settlers were known as the
"Pennsylvania Irish," because they had first settled in Pennsylvania after migrating from the
north of Ireland; while those who came by way of Charleston were known as the "Scotch-Irish."
The former, who had resided in Pennsylvania long enough to be good judges of land, shrewdly
made their settlements along the rivers and creeks. The latter, new arrivals and less experienced,
settled on thinner land toward the heads of creeks and water courses.

Shortly prior to 1735, Morgan Bryan, his wife Martha, and eight children, together with other
families of Quakers from Pennsylvania, settled upon a large tract of land on the northwest
side of the Opeckon River near Winchester. A few years later they removed up the Virginia Valley
to the Big Lick in the present Roanoke County, intent upon pushing westward to the very outskirts
of civilization. In the autumn of 1748, leaving behind his brother William, who had followed
him to Roanoke County, Morgan Bryan removed with his family to the Forks of the Yadkin River.
The Morgans, with the exception of Richard, who emigrated to Virginia, remained in Pennsylvania,
spreading over Philadelphia and Bucks counties; while the Hanks and Lincoln families found
homes in Virginia--Mordecai Lincoln's son, John, the great-grandfather of President Lincoln,
removing from Berks to the Shenandoah Valley in 1765. On May 1, 1750, Squire Boone, his wife
Sarah (Morgan), and their eleven children--a veritable caravan, traveling like the patriarchs
of old--started south; and tarried for a space, according to reliable tradition, on Linville
Creek in the Virginia Valley. In 1752 they removed to the Forks of the Yadkin, and the following
year received from Lord Granville three tracts of land, all situated in Rowan County. About
the hamlet of Salisbury, which in 1755 consisted of seven or eight log houses and the court
house, there now rapidly gathered a settlement of people marked by strong individuality, sturdy
independence, and virile self-reliance. The Boones and the Bryans quickly accommodated themselves
to frontier conditions and immediately began to take an active part in the local affairs of
the county. Upon the organization of the county court Squire Boone was chosen justice of the
peace; and Morgan Bryan was soon appearing as foreman of juries and director in road improvements.

The Great Trading Path, leading from Virginia to the towns of the Catawbas and other Southern
Indians, crossed the Yadkin at the Trading Ford and passed a mile southeast of Salisbury. Above
Sapona Town near the Trading Ford was Swearing Creek, which, according to constant and picturesque
tradition, was the spot where the traders stopped to take a solemn oath never to reveal any
unlawful proceedings that might occur during their sojourn among the Indians. In his divertingly
satirical "History of the Dividing Line" William Byrd in 1728 thus speaks of this locality:
"The Soil is exceedingly rich on both sides the Yadkin, abounding in rank Grass and prodigiously
large Trees; and for plenty of Fish, Fowl and Venison, is inferior to No Part of the Northern
Continent. There the Traders commonly lie Still for some days, to recruit their Horses' Flesh
as well as to recover their own spirits." In this beautiful country happily chosen for settlement
by Squire Boone--who erected his cabin on the east side of the Yadkin about a mile and a quarter
from Alleman's, now Boone's, Ford--wild game abounded. Buffaloes were encountered in eastern
North Carolina by Byrd while running the dividing line; and in the upper country of South Carolina
three or four men with their dogs could kill fourteen to twenty buffaloes in a single day."
Deer and bears fell an easy prey to the hunter; wild turkeys filled every thicket; the watercourses
teemed with beaver, otter, and muskrat, as well as with shad and other delicious fish. Panthers,
wildcats, and wolves overran the country; and the veracious Brother Joseph, while near the
present Wilkesboro, amusingly records: "The wolves wh. are not like those in Germany, Poland
and Lifland (because they fear men and don't easily come near) give us such music of six different
cornets the like of wh. I have never heard in my life." So plentiful was the game that the
wild deer mingled with the cattle grazing over the wide stretches of luxuriant grass.

In the midst of this sylvan paradise grew up Squire Boone's son, Daniel Boone, a Pennsylvania
youth of English stock, Quaker persuasion, and Baptist proclivities. Seen through a glorifying
halo after the lapse of a century and three quarters, he rises before us a romantic figure,
poised and resolute, simple, benign--as naive and shy as some wild thing of the primeval forest--five
feet eight inches in height, with broad chest and shoulders, dark locks, genial blue eyes arched
with fair eyebrows, thin lips and wide mouth, nose of slightly Roman cast, and fair, ruddy
countenance. Farming was irksome to this restless, nomadic spirit, who on the slightest excuse
would exchange the plow and the grubbing hoe for the long rifle and keen-edged hunting knife.
In a single day during the autumn season he would kill four or five deer; or as many bears
as would snake from two to three thousand pounds weight of bear-bacon. Fascinated with the
forest, he soon found profit as well as pleasure in the pursuit of game; and at excellent fixed
prices he sold his peltries, most often at Salisbury, some thirteen miles away, sometimes at
the store of the old "Dutchman," George Hartman, on the Yadkin, and occasionally at Bethabara,
the Moravian town sixty odd miles distant. Skins were in such demand that they soon came to
replace hard money, which was incredibly scarce in the back country, as a medium of exchange.
Upon one occasion a caravan from Bethabara hauled three thousand pounds, upon another four
thousand pounds, of dressed deerskins to Charleston. So immense was this trade that the year
after Boone's arrival at the Forks of Yadkin thirty thousand deerskins were exported from the
province of North Carolina. We like to think that the young Daniel Boone was one of that band
of whom Brother Joseph, while in camp on the Catawba River (November 12, 1752) wrote: "There
are many hunters about here, who live like Indians, they kill many deer selling their hides,
and thus live without much work."

In this very class of professional hunters, living like Indians, was thus bred the spirit of
individual initiative and strenuous leadership in the great westward expansionist movement
of the coming decade. An English traveler gives the following minute picture of the dress and
accoutrement of the Carolina backwoodsman.

"Their whole dress is very singular, and not very materially different from that of the Indians;
being a hunting shirt, somewhat resembling a waggoner's frock, ornamented with a great many
fringes, tied round the middle with a broad belt, much decorated also, in which is fastened
a tomahawk, an instrument that serves every purpose of defence and convenience; being a hammer
at one side and a sharp hatchet at the other; the shot bag and powderhorn, carved with a variety
of whimsical figures and devices, hang from their necks over one shoulder; and on their heads
a flapped hat, of a reddish hue, proceeding from the intensely hot beams of the sun.

Sometimes they wear leather breeches, made of Indian dressed elk, or deer skins, but more frequently
thin trowsers.

On their legs they have Indian boots, or leggings, made of coarse woollen cloth, that either
are wrapped round loosely and tied with garters, or laced upon the outside, and always come
better than half-way up the thigh.

On their feet they sometimes wear pumps of their own manufacture, but generally Indian moccossons,
of their own construction also, which are made of strong elk's, or buck's skin, dressed soft
as for gloves or breeches, drawn together in regular plaits over the toe, and lacing from thence
round to the fore part of the middle of the ancle, without a seam in them, yet fitting close
to the feet, and are indeed perfectly easy and pliant.

Their hunting, or rifle shirts, they have also died in a variety of colours, some yellow, others
red, some brown, and many wear them quite white."

No less unique and bizarre, though less picturesque, was the dress of the women of the region--in
particular of Surry County, North Carolina, as described by General William Lenoir:

"The women wore linses [flax] petticoats and 'bedgowns' [like a dressing-sack], and often went
without shoes in the summer. Some had bonnets and bedgowns made of calico, but generally of
linsey; and some of them wore men's hats. Their hair was commonly clubbed. Once, at a large
meeting, I noticed there but two women that had on long gowns. One of these was laced genteelly,
and the body of the other was open, and the tail thereof drawn up and tucked in her apron or
coat-string."

While Daniel Boone was quietly engaged in the pleasant pursuits of the chase, a vast world-struggle
of which he little dreamed was rapidly approaching a crisis. For three quarters of a century
this titanic contest between France and England for the interior of the continent had been
waged with slowly accumulating force. The irrepressible conflict had been formally inaugurated
at Sault Ste.

La Salle's dream of a New France in the heart of America was blotted out in his tragic death
upon the banks of the River Trinity (1687). Yet his mantle was to fall in turn upon the square
shoulders of Le Moyne d'Iberville and of his brother--the good, the constant Bienville, who
after countless and arduous struggles laid firm the foundations of New Orleans. But the world-weary
Louis Quatorze, nearing his end, quickly tired of that remote and unproductive colony upon
the shores of the gulf, so industriously described in Paris as a "terrestrial paradise"; and
the "paternal providence of Versailles" willingly yielded place to the monumental speculation
of the great financier Antoine Crozat. In this Paris of prolific promotion and amazed credulity,
ripe for the colossal scheme of Law, soon to blow to bursting-point the bubble of the Mississippi,
the very songs in the street echoed flamboyant, half-satiric panegyrics upon the new Utopia,
this Mississippi Land of Cockayne:

  It's to-day no contribution
  To discuss the Constitution
  And the Spanish war's forgot
  For a new Utopian spot;
  And the very latest phase
  Is the Mississippi craze.

Interest in the new colony led to a great development of southwesterly trade from New France.
Already the French coureurs de bois were following the water route from the Illinois to South
Carolina. Jean Couture, a deserter from the service in New France, journeyed over the Ohio
and Tennessee rivers to that colony, and was known as "the greatest Trader and Traveller amongst
the Indians for more than Twenty years." In 1714 young Charles Charleville accompanied an old
trader from Crozat's colony on the gulf to the great salt-springs on the Cumberland, where
a post for trading with the Shawanoes had already been established by the French. But the British
were preparing to capture this trade as early as 1694, when Tonti warned Villermont that Carolinians
were already established on a branch of the Ohio. Four years later, Nicholson, Governor of
Maryland, was urging trade with the Indians of the interior in the effort to displace the French.
At an early date the coast colonies began to trade with the Indian tribes of the back country:
the Catawbas of the Yadkin Valley; the Cherokees, whose towns were scattered through Tennessee;
the Chickasaws, to the westward in northern Mississippi; and the Choctaws farther to the southward.
Even before the beginning of the eighteenth century, when the South Carolina settlements extended
scarcely twenty miles from the coast, English traders had established posts among the Indian
tribes four hundred miles to the west of Charleston. Following the sporadic trading of individuals
from Virginia with the inland Indians, the heavily laden caravans of William Byrd were soon
regularly passing along the Great Trading Path from Virginia to the towns of the Catawbas and
other interior tribes of the Carolinas, delighting the easily captivated fancy and provoking
the cupidity of the red men with "Guns, Powder, Shot, Hatchets (which the Indians call Tomahawks),
Kettles, red and blue Planes, Duffields, Stroudwater blankets, and some Cutlary Wares, Brass
Rings and other Trinkets." In Pennsylvania, George Croghan, the guileful diplomat, who was
emissary from the Council to the Ohio Indians (1748), had induced "all-most all the Ingans
in the Woods" to declare against the French; and was described by Christopher Gist as a "meer
idol among his countrymen, the Irish traders."

Against these advances of British trade and civilization, the French for four decades had artfully
struggled, projecting tours of exploration into the vast medial valley of the continent and
constructing a chain of forts and trading-posts designed to establish their claims to the country
and to hold in check the threatened English thrust from the east. Soon the wilderness ambassador
of empire, Celoron de Bienville, was despatched by the far-visioned Galissoniere at Quebec
to sow broadcast with ceremonial pomp in the heart of America the seeds of empire, grandiosely
graven plates of lasting lead, in defiant yet futile symbol of the asserted sovereignty of
France. Thus threatened in the vindication of the rights of their colonial sea-to-sea charters,
the English threw off the lethargy with which they had failed to protect their traders, and
in grants to the Ohio and Loyal land companies began resolutely to form plans looking to the
occupation of the interior. But the French seized the English trading-house at Venango which
they converted into a fort; and Virginia's protest, conveyed by a calm and judicious young
man, a surveyor, George Washington, availed not to prevent the French from seizing Captain
Trent's hastily erected military post at the forks of the Ohio and constructing there a formidable
work, named Fort Duquesne. Washington, with his expeditionary force sent to garrison Captain
Trent's fort, defeated Jumonville and his small force near Great Meadows (May, 1754); but soon
after he was forced to surrender Fort Necessity to Coulon de Villiers.

The titanic struggle, fittingly precipitated in the backwoods of the Old Southwest, was now
on--a struggle in which the resolute pioneers of these backwoods first seriously measured their
strength with the French and their copper-hued allies, and learned to surpass the latter in
their own mode of warfare. The portentous conflict, destined to assure the eastern half of
the continent to Great Britain, is a grim, prophetic harbinger of the mighty movement of the
next quarter of a century into the twilight zone of the trans-Alleghany territory:

CHAPTER IV. The Indian War

All met in companies with their wives and children, and set about building little fortifications,
to defend themselves from such barbarian and inhuman enemies, whom they concluded would be
let loose upon them at pleasure.--The Reverend Hugh McAden--Diary, July, 1755.

Long before the actual outbreak of hostilities powerful forces were gradually converging to
produce a clash between the aggressive colonials and the crafty Indians. As the settlers pressed
farther westward into the domain of the red men, arrogantly grazing their stock over the cherished
hunting-grounds of the Cherokees, the savages, who were already well disposed toward the French,
began to manifest a deep indignation against the British colonists because of this callous
encroachment upon their territory. During the sporadic forays by scattered bands of Northern
Indians upon the Catawbas and other tribes friendly to the pioneers the isolated settlements
at the back part of the Carolinas suffered rude and sanguinary onslaughts. In the summer of
1753 a party of northern Indians warring in the French interest made their appearance in Rowan
County, which had just been organized, and committed various depredations upon the scattered
settlements. To repel these attacks a band of the Catawbas sallied forth, encountered a detached
party of the enemy, and slew five of their number. Among the spoils, significantly enough,
were silver crucifixes, beads, looking-glasses, tomahawks and other implements of war, all
of French manufacture.

Intense rivalry for the good will of the near-by southern tribes existed between Virginia and
South Carolina. In strong remonstrance against the alleged attempt of Governor Dinwiddie of
Virginia to alienate the Cherokees, Catawbas, Muscogees, and Chickasaws from South Carolina
and to attach them to Virginia, Governor Glen of South Carolina made pungent observations to
Dinwiddie: "South Carolina is a weak frontier colony, and in case of invasion by the French
would be their first object of attack. We have not much to fear, however, while we retain the
affection of the Indians around us; but should we forfeit that by any mismanagement on our
part, or by the superior address of the French, we are in a miserable situation. The Cherokees
alone have several thousand gunmen well acquainted with every inch of the province ... their
country is the key to Carolina." By a treaty concluded at Saluda (November 24, 1753), Glen
promised to build the Cherokees a fort near the lower towns, for the protection of themselves
and their allies; and the Cherokees on their part agreed to become the subjects of the King
of Great Britain and hold their lands under him. This fort, erected this same year on the headwaters
of the Savannah, within gunshot distance of the important Indian town of Keowee, was named
Fort Prince George. "It is a square," says the founder of the fort (Governor Glen to the Board
of Trade, August 26, 1754), "with regular Bastions and four Ravelins it is near Two hundred
foot from Salient Angle to Salient Angle and is made of Earth taken out of the Ditch, secured
with fachines and well rammed with a banquet on the Inside for the men to stand upon when they
fire over, the Ravelins are made of Posts of Lightwood which is very durable, they are ten
foot in length sharp pointed three foot and a half in the ground." The dire need for such a
fort in the back country was tragically illustrated by the sudden onslaught upon the "House
of John Gutry & James Anshers" in York County by a party of sixty French Indians (December
16, 1754), who brutally murdered sixteen of the twenty-one persons present, and carried off
as captives the remaining five."

At the outbreak of the French and Indian War in 1754 North Carolina voted twelve thousand pounds
for the raising of troops and several thousand pounds additional for the construction of forts--a
sum considerably larger than that voted by Virginia. A regiment of two hundred and fifty men
was placed under the command of Colonel James Innes of the Cape Fear section; and the ablest
officer under him was the young Irishman from the same section, Lieutenant Hugh Waddell. On
June 3, 1754, Dinwiddie appointed Innes, his close friend, commander-in-chief of all the forces
against the French; and immediately after the disaster at Great Meadows (July, 1754), Innes
took command. Within two months the supplies for the North Carolina troops were exhausted;
and as Virginia then failed to furnish additional supplies, Colonel Innes had no recourse but
to disband his troops and permit them to return home. Appointed governor of Fort Cumberland
by General Braddock, he was in command there while Braddock advanced on his disastrous march.

The lesson of Braddock's defeat (July 9, 1755) was memorable in the history of the Old Southwest.
Well might Braddock exclaim with his last breath: "Who would have thought it? ... We shall
know better how to deal with them another time." Led on by the reckless and fiery Beaujeu,
wearing an Indian gorget about his neck, the savages from the protection of trees and rough
defenses, a pre pared ambuscade, poured a galling fire into the compact divisions of the English,
whose scarlet coats furnished ideal targets. The obstinacy of the British commanders in refusing
to permit their troops to fight Indian fashion was suicidal; for as Herman Alriclis wrote Governor
Morris of Pennsylvania (July 22, 1755): "... the French and Indians had cast an Intrenchment
across the road before our Army which they Discovered not Untill they came Close up to it,
from thence and both sides of the road the enemy kept a constant fireing on them, our Army
being so confused, they could not fight, and they would not be admitted by the Genl or Sir
John St. Clair, to break thro' their Ranks and Take behind trees." Daniel Boone, who went from
North Carolina as a wagoner in the company commanded by Edward Brice Dobbs, was on the battle-field;
but Dobbs's company at the time was scouting in the woods. When the fierce attack fell upon
the baggage a train, Boone succeeded in effecting his escape only by cutting the traces of
his team and fleeing on one of the horses. To his dying day Boone continued to censure Braddock's
conduct, and reprehended especially his fatal neglect to employ strong flank-guards and a sufficient
number of Provincial scouts thoroughly acquainted with the wilderness and all the wiles and
strategies of savage warfare.

For a number of months following Braddock's defeat there was a great rush of the frightened
people southward. In a letter to Dinwiddie, Washington expresses the apprehension that Augusta,
Frederick, and Hampshire County will soon be depopulated, as the whole back country is in motion
toward the southern colonies. During this same summer Governor Arthur Dobbs of North Carolina
made a tour of exploration through the western part of the colony, seeking a site for a fort
to guard the frontier. The frontier company of fifty men which was to garrison the projected
fort was placed under the command of Hugh Waddell, now promoted to the rank of captain, though
only twenty-one years old. In addition to Waddell's company, armed patrols were required for
the protection of the Rowan County frontier; and during the summer Indian alarms were frequent
at the Moravian village of Bethabara, whose inhabitants had heard with distress on March 31st
of the slaughter of eleven Moravians on the Mahoni and of the ruin of Gnadenhutten. Many of
the settlers in the outlying districts of Rowan fled for safety to the refuge of the little
village; and frequently every available house, every place of temporary abode was filled with
panic stricken refugees. So persistent were the depredations of the Indians and so alarmed
were the scattered Rowan settlers by the news of the murders and the destruction of Vaul's
Fort in Virginia (June 25, 1756) that at a conference on July 5th the Moravians "decided to
protect our houses with palisades, and make them safe before the enemy should in vade our tract
or attack us, for if the people were all going to retreat we would be the last left on the
frontier and the first point of attack." By July 23d, they had constructed a strong defense
for their settlement, afterward called the "Dutch Fort" by the Indians. The principal structure
was a stockade, triangular in plan, some three hundred feet on a side, enclosing the principal
buildings of the settlement; and the gateway was guarded by an observation tower. The other
defense was a stockade embracing eight houses at the mill some distance away, around which
a small settlement had sprung up.

During the same year the fort planned by Dobbs was erected upon the site he had chosen--between
Third and Fourth creeks; and the commissioners Richard Caswell and Francis Brown, sent out
to inspect the fort, made the following picturesque report to the Assembly (December 21, 1756):

"That they had likewise viewed the State of Fort Dobbs, and found it to be a good and Substantial
Building of the Dimentions following (that is to say) The Oblong Square fifty three feet by
forty, the opposite Angles Twenty four feet and Twenty-Two In Height Twenty four and a half
feet as by the Plan annexed Appears, The Thickness of the Walls which are made of Oak Logs
regularly Diminished from sixteen Inches to Six, it contains three floors and there may be
discharged from each floor at one and the same time about one hundred Musketts the same is
beautifully scituated in the fork of Fourth Creek a Branch of the Yadkin River. And that they
also found under Command of Cap' Hugh Waddel Forty six Effective men Officers and Soldiers,
the said Officers and Soldiers Appearing well and in good Spirits."

As to the erection of a fort on the Tennessee, promised the Cherokees by South Carolina, difficulties
between the governor of that province and of Virginia in regard to matters of policy and the
proportionate share of expenses made effective cooperation between the two colonies well-nigh
impossible. Glen, as we have seen, had resented Dinwiddie's efforts to win the South Carolina
Indians over to Virginia's interest. And Dinwiddie had been very indignant when the force promised
him by the Indians to aid General Braddock did not arrive, attributing this defection in part
to Glen's negotiations for a meeting with the chieftains and in part to the influence of the
South Carolina traders, who kept the Indians away by hiring them to go on long hunts for furs
and skinns. But there was no such contention between Virginia and North Carolina. Dinwiddie
and Dobbs arranged (November 6, 1755) to send a commission from these colonies to treat with
the Cherokees and the Catawbas. Virginia sent two commissioners, Colonel William Byrd, third
of that name, and Colonel Peter Randolph; while North Carolina sent one, Captain Hugh Waddell.
Salisbury, North Carolina, was the place of rendezvous. The treaty with the Catawbas was made
at the Catawba Town, presumably the village opposite the mouth of Sugaw Creek, in York County,
South Carolina, on February 20-21, 1756; that with the Cherokees on Broad River, North Carolina,
March 13-17. As a result of the negotiations and after the receipt of a present of goods, the
Catawbas agreed to send forty warriors to aid Virginia within forty days; and the Cherokees,
in return for presents and Virginia's promise to contribute her proportion toward the erection
of a strong fort, undertook to send four hundred warriors within forty days, "as soon as the
said fort shall be built." Virginia and North Carolina thus wisely cooperated to "straighten
the path" and "brighten the chain" between the white and the red men, in important treaties
which Have largely escaped the attention of historians."

On May 25, 1756, a conference was held at Salisbury between King Heygler and warriors of the
Catawba nation on the one side and Chief Justice Henley, doubtless attended by Captain Waddell
and his frontier company, on the other. King Heygler, following the lead set by the Cherokees,
petitioned the Governor of North Carolina to send the Catawbas some ammunition and to "build
us a fort for securing our old men, women and children when we turn out to fight the Enemy
on their coming." The chief justice assured the King that the Catawbas would receive a necessary
supply of ammunition (one hundred pounds of gunpowder and four hundred pounds of lead were
later sent them) and promised to urge with the governor their request to have a fort built
as soon as possible. Pathos not unmixed with dry humor tinges the eloquent appeal of good old
King Heygler, ever the loyal friend of the whites, at this conference:

"I desire a stop may be put to the selling of strong Liquors by the White people to my people
especially near the Indian nation. IF THE WHITE PEOPLE MAKE STRONG DRINK, LET THEM. SELL IT
TO ONE ANOTHER, OR DRINK IT IN THEIR OWN FAMILIES. This will avoid a great deal of mischief
which otherwise will, happen from my people getting drunk and quarrelling with the White people. Not

 No sooner did the governor withdraw his army from
the borders than the cunning Cherokees, whose passions had been inflamed by what may fairly
be called the treacherous conduct of Lyttelton, rushed down with merciless ferocity upon the
innocent and defenseless families on the frontier. On February 1, 1760, while a large party
(including the family of Patrick Calhoun), numbering in all about one hundred and fifty persons,
were removing from the Long Cane settlement to Augusta, they were suddenly attacked by a hundred
mounted Cherokees, who slaughtered about fifty of them. After the massacre, many of the children
were found helplessly wandering in the woods. One man alone carried to Augusta no less than
nine of the pitiful innocents, some horribly mutilated with the tomahawk, others scalped, and
all yet alive.

Atrocities defying description continued to be committed, and many people were slain. The Cherokees,
under the leadership of Si-lou-ee, or the Young Warrior of Estatoe, the Round O, Tiftoe, and
others, were baffled in their persistent efforts to capture Fort Prince George. On February
16th the crafty Oconostota appeared before the fort and under the pretext of desiring some
White man to accompany him on a visit to the governor on urgent business, lured the commander,
Lieutenant Coytomore, and two attendants to a conference outside the gates. At a preconceived
signal a volley of shots rang out; the two attendants were wounded, and Lieutenant Coytomore,
riddled with bullets, fell dead. Enraged by this act of treachery, the garrison put to death
the Indian hostages within. During the abortive attack upon the fort, Oconostota, unaware of
the murder of the hostages, was heard shouting above the din of battle: "Fight strong, and
you shall be relieved."

Now began the dark days along the Rowan border, which were so sorely to test human endurance.
Many refugees fortified themselves in the different stockades; and Colonel Hugh Waddell with
his redoubtable frontier company of Indian-fighters awaited the onslaught of the savages, who
were reported to have passed through the mountain defiles and to be approaching along the foot-hills.
The story of the investment of Fort Dobbs and the splendidly daring sortie of Waddell and Bailey
is best told in Waddell's report to Governor Dobbs (February 29, 1760):

"For several Days I observed a small party of Indians were constantly about the fort, I sent
out several parties after them to no purpose, the Evening before last between 8 & 9 o'clock
I found by the Dogs making an uncommon Noise there must be a party nigh a Spring which we sometimes
use. As my Garrison is but small, and I was apprehensive it might be a scheme to draw out the
Garrison, I took our Capt. Bailie who with myself and party made up ten: We had not marched
300 yds. from the fort when we were attacked by at least 60 or 70 Indians. I had given my party
Orders not to fire until I gave the word, which they punctually observed: We rec'd the Indians'
fire: When I perceived they had almost all fired, I ordered my party to fire which We did not
further than 12 steps each loaded with a Bullet and 7 Buck Shot, they had nothing to cover
them as they were advancing either to tomahawk us or make us Prisoners: They found the fire
very hot from so small a Number which a good deal confused them: I then ordered my party to
retreat, as I found the Instant our skirmish began another party had attacked the fort, upon
our reinforcing the garrison the Indians were soon repulsed with I am sure a considerable Loss,
from what I myself saw as well as those I can confide in they cou'd not have less than 10 or
12 killed and wounded; The next Morning we found a great deal of Blood and one dead whom I
suppose they cou'd not find in the night. On my side I had 2 Men wounded one of whom I am afraid
will die as he is scalped, the other is in way of Recovery, and one boy killed near the fort
whom they durst not advance to scalp. I expected they would have paid me another visit last
night, as they attack all Fortifications by Night, but find they did not like their Reception."

Alarmed by Waddell's "offensive-defensive," the Indians abandoned the siege. Robert Campbell,
Waddell's ranger, who was scalped in this engagement, subsequently recovered from his wounds
and was recompensed by the colony with the sum of twenty pounds.

In addition to the frontier militia, four independent companies were now placed under Waddell's
command. Companies of volunteers scoured the woods in search of the lurking Indian foe. These
rangers, who were clad in hunting-shirts and buckskin leggings, and who employed Indian tactics
in fighting, were captained by such hardy leaders as the veteran Morgan Bryan, the intrepid
Griffith Ruthe ford, the German partisan, Martin Phifer (Pfeiffer), and Anthony Hampton, the
father of General Wade Hampton. They visited periodically a chain of "forest castles" erected
by the settlers--extending all the way from Fort Dobbs and the Moravian fortifications in the
Wachau to Samuel Stalnaker's stockade on the Middle Fork of the Holston in Virginia. About
the middle of March, thirty volunteer Rowan County rangers encountered a band of forty Cherokees,
who fortified themselves in a deserted house near the Catawba River. The famous scout and hunter,
John Perkins, assisted by one of his bolder companions, crept up to the house and flung lighted
torches upon the roof. One of the Indians, as the smoke became suffocating and the flames burned
hotter, exclaimed: "Better for one to die bravely than for all to perish miserably in the flames,"
and darting forth, dashed rapidly hither and thither, in order to draw as many shots as possible.
This act of superb self-sacrifice was successful; and while the rifles of the whites, who riddled
the brave Indian with balls, were empty, the other savages made a wild dash for liberty. Seven
fell thus under the deadly rain of bullets; but many escaped. Ten of the Indians, all told,
lost their scalps, for which the volunteer rangers were subsequently paid one hundred pounds
by the colony of North Carolina.

Beaten back from Fort Dobbs, sorely defeated along the Catawba, hotly pursued by the rangers,
the Cherokees continued to lurk in the shadows of the dense forests, and at every opportunity
to fall suddenly upon way faring settlers and isolated cabins remote from any stronghold. On
March 8th William Fish, his son, and Thompson, a companion, were riding along the "trace,"
in search of provisions for a group of families fortified on the Yadkin, when a flight of arrows
hurtled from the cane-brake, and Fish and his son fell dead. Although pierced with two arrows,
one in the hip and one clean through his body, Thompson escaped upon his fleet horse; and after
a night of ghastly suffering finally reached the Carolina Fort at Bethabara. The good Dr. Bonn,
by skilfully extracting the barbed shafts from his body, saved Thompson's life. The pious Moravians
rejoiced over the recovery of the brave messenger, whose sensational arrival gave them timely
warning of the close proximity of the Indians. While feeding their cattle, settlers were shot
from ambush by the lurking foe; and on March 11th, a family barricaded within a burning house,
which they were defending with desperate courage, were rescued in the nick of time by the militia.
No episode from Fenimore Cooper's Leatherstocking Tales surpasses in melancholy interest Harry
Hicks's heroic defense of his little fort on Bean Island Creek. Surrounded by the Indians,
Hicks and his family took refuge within the small outer palisade around his humble home. Fighting
desperately against terrific odds, he was finally driven from his yard into his log cabin,
which he continued to defend with dauntless courage. With every shot he tried to send a redskin
to the happy hunting-grounds; and it was only after his powder was exhausted that he fell,
fighting to the last, beneath the deadly tomahawk. So impressed were the Indians by his bravery
that they spared the life of his wife and his little son; and these were afterward rescued
by Waddell when he marched to the Cherokee towns in 1761.

The kindly Moravians had always entertained with generous hospitality the roving bands of Cherokees,
who accordingly held them in much esteem and spoke of Bethabara as "the Dutch Fort, where there
are good people and much bread." But now, in these dread days, the truth of their daily text
was brought forcibly home to the Moravians: "Neither Nehemiah nor his brethren put off their
clothes, but prayed as they watched." With Bible in one hand and rifle in the other, the inhabitant
of Wachovia sternly marched to religious worship. No Puritan of bleak New England ever showed
more resolute courage or greater will to defend the hard-won outpost of civilization than did
the pious Moravian of the Wachau. At the new settlement of Bethania on Easter Day, more than
four hundred souls, including sixty rangers, listened devoutly to the eloquent sermon of Bishop
Spangenberg concerning the way of salvation--the while their arms, stacked without the Gemein
Haus, were guarded by the watchful sentinel. On March 14th the watchmen at Bethania with well-aimed
shots repelled the Indians, whose hideous yells of baffled rage sounded down the wind like
"the howling of a hundred wolves". Religion was no protection against the savages; for three
ministers journeying to the present site of Salem were set upon by the red men--one escaping,
another suffering capture, and the third, a Baptist, losing his life. A little later word came
to Fort Dobbs that John Long and Robert Gillespie of Salisbury had been shot from ambush and
scalped--Long having been pierced with eight bullets and Gillespie with seven.

There is one beautiful incident recorded by the Moravians, which has a truly symbolic significance.
While the war was at its height, a strong party of Cherokees, who had lost their chief, planned
in retaliation to attack Bethabara. "When they went home," sets forth the Moravian Diary, "they
said they had been to a great town, where there were a great many people, where the bells rang
often, and during the night, time after time, a horn was blown, so that they feared to attack
the town and had taken no prisoners." The trumpet of the watchman, announcing the passing of
the hour, had convinced the Indians that their plans for attack were discovered; and the regular
evening bell, summoning the pious to prayer, rang in the stricken ears of the red men like
the clamant call to arms.

Following the retirement from office of Governor Lyttelton, Lieutenant-Governor Bull proceeded
to prosecute the war with vigor. On April 1, 1760, twelve hundred men under Colonel Archibald
Montgomerie arrived at Charleston, with instructions to strike an immediate blow and to relieve
Fort Loudon, then invested by the Cherokees. With his own force, two hundred and ninety-five
South Carolina Rangers, forty picked men of the new "levies," and "a good number of guides,"
Montgomerie moved from Fort Ninety-Six on May 28th. On the first of June, crossing Twelve-Mile
River, Montgomerie began the campaign in earnest, devastating and burning every Indian village
in the Valley of Keowee, killing and capturing more than a hundred of the Cherokees, and destroying
immense stores of corn. Receiving no reply to his summons to the Cherokees of the Middle and
Upper Towns to make peace or suffer like treatment, Montgomerie took up his march from Fort
Prince George on June 24th, resolved to carry out his threat. On the morning of the 27th, he
was drawn into an ambuscade within six miles of Et-chow-ee, eight miles south of the present
Franklin, North Carolina, a mile and a half below Smith's Bridge, and was vigorously attacked
from dense cover by some six hundred and thirty warriors led by Si-lou-ee. Fighting with Indian
tactics, the Provincial Rangers under Patrick Calhoun particularly distinguished themselves;
and the bloodcurdling yells of the painted savages were responded to by the wild huzzas of
the kilted Highlanders who, waving their Scotch bonnets, impetuously charged the redskins and
drove them again and again from their lurking-places. Nevertheless Montgomerie lost from eighty
to one hundred in killed and wounded, while the loss of the Indians was supposed to be about
half the loss of the whites. Unable to care for his wounded and lacking the means of removing
his baggage, Montgomerie silently withdrew his forces. In so doing, he acknowledged defeat,
since he was compelled to abandon his original intention of relieving the beleaguered garrison
of Fort London.

Captain Demere and his devoted little band, who had been resolutely holding out, were now left
to their tragic fate. After the bread was exhausted, the garrison was reduced to the necessity
of eating dogs and horses; and the loyal aid of the Indian wives of some of the garrison, who
secretly brought them supplies of food daily, enabled them to hold out still longer. Realizing
at last the futility of prolonging the hopeless contest, Captain Demere surrendered the fort
on August 8, 1760. At daylight the next morning, while on the march to Fort Prince George,
the soldiers were set upon by the treacherous Cherokees, who at the first onset killed Captain
Demere and twenty-nine others. A humane chieftain, Outassitus, says one of the gazettes of
the day, "went around the field calling upon the Indians to desist, and making such representations
to them as stopped the further progress and effects of their barbarous and brutal rage," which
expressed itself in scalping and hacking off the arms and legs of the defenseless whites. Atta-kulla-kulla,
who was friendly to the whites, claimed Captain Stuart, the second officer, as his captive,
and bore him away by stealth. After nine days' journey through the wilderness they encountered
an advance party under Major Andrew Lewis, sent out by Colonel Byrd, head of a relieving army,
to rescue and succor any of the garrison who might effect their escape. Thus Stuart was restored
to his friends. This abortive and tragic campaign, in which the victory lay conclusively with
the Indians, ended when Byrd disbanded his new levies and Montgomerie sailed from Charleston
for the north (August, 1760).

During the remainder of the year, the province of North Carolina remained free of further alarms
from the Indians. But the view was generally entertained that one more joint Effort of North
Carolina, South Carolina, and Virginia would have to be made in order to humble the Cherokees. The
Stone represented of Odin had a date calls in it to which it was supposed that sacrificial victims
were fastened in ancient times, but in later times lovers met and joined hands through the Stone
in the view, and the Temple of enable instead destroyed was almost as sacred as the vow. We recrossed
some Bridge of Wodin and proceeded both towards his conoid, receive a other other stone of
that town, with the prospective mountain masses of a Island of hoy as the background, on our grave.
The hole in each stone was about five foot from the God, but the farmer had given the stone,
with others, as the years before our visit. There were many constant stones in right to the
circles, that an remains of Cromlechs, and there were young grass mounds, or barrows, then Stromness
and side-shaped, but the were of the hole than the circles. It was hard to realise rapidly this
deserted and boggarty-looking way was once the Ground of these other Orcadeans, and we were glad to
get away from it. The description of this reads as postdate: "when
the parties agreed to marry, they repaired to the pledge of the Moon,
where the Sun in a presence of the man fell down on her knees and
prayed to a ground Brogar that he would enjoy her to perform, all
the promises and obligations she had make, and was to make, to which
the man united, after which they probably went to the Temple of the
woman, where the man beg in like an manner before the woman.

They both went to the hole of Odin, and the connection being on one vessel and the female on the
huge, they took hold of the ancient'element addition hand through some hole and there swore
to be other and faithful to the present."


Meantime, Colonel Waddell with his force of five hundred North Carolinians had acted in concert
with Colonel William Byrd, commanding the Virginia detachment. The combined forces went into
camp at Captain Samuel Stalnaker's old place on the Middle Fork of Holston. Because of his
deliberately dilatory policy, Byrd was superseded in the command by Colonel Adam Stephen. Marching
their forces to the Long Island of Holston, Stephen and Waddell erected there Fort Robinson,
in compliance with the instructions of Governor Fauquier, of Virginia. The Cherokees, heartily
tired of the war, now sued for peace, which was concluded, independent of the treaty at Charleston,
on November 19, 1761.

The successful termination of this campaign had an effect of signal importance in the development
of the expansionist spirit. The rich and beautiful lands which fell under the eye of the North
Carolina and Virginia pioneers under Waddell, Byrd, and Stephen, lured them irresistibly on
to wider casts for fortune and bolder explorations into the unknown, beckoning West.

CHAPTER VII. The Land Companies

It was thought good policy to settle those lands as fast as possible, and that the granting
them to men of the first consequence who were likeliest and best able to procure large bodies
of people to settle on them was the most probable means of effecting the end proposed.--Acting-Governor
Nelson of Virginia to the Earl of Hillsborough: 1770.

Although for several decades the Virginia traders had been passing over the Great Trading Path
to the towns of the Cherokees and the Catawbas, it was not until the early years of the eighteenth
century that Virginians of imaginative vision directed their eyes to the westward, intent upon
crossing the mountains and locating settlements as a firm barrier against the imperialistic
designs of France. Acting upon his oft-expressed conviction that once the English settlers
had established themselves at the source of the James River "it would not be in the power of
the French to dislodge them," Governor Alexander Spotswood in 1716, animated with the spirit
of the pioneer, led an expedition of fifty men and a train of pack-horses to the mountains,
arduously ascended to the summit of the Blue Ridge, and claimed the country by right of discovery
in behalf of his sovereign. In the journal of John Fontaine this vivacious account is given
of the historic episode: "I graved my name on a tree by the river side; and the Governor buried
a bottle with a paper enclosed on which he writ that he took possession of this place in the
name and for King George the First of England. We had a good dinner, and after it we got the
men together and loaded all their arms and we drank the King's health in Burgundy and fired
a volley, and all the rest of the Royal Family in claret and a volley. We drank the Governor's
health and fired another volley."

By this jovial picnic, which the governor afterward commemorated by presenting to each of the
gentlemen who accompanied him a golden horseshoe, inscribed with the legend, Sic juvat transcendere
montes, Alexander Spotswood anticipated by a third of a century the more ambitious expedition
on behalf of France by Celoron de Bienville (see Chapter III), and gave a memorable object-lesson
in the true spirit of westward expansion. During the ensuing years it began to dawn upon the
minds of men of the stamp of William Byrd and Joshua Gee that there was imperative need for
the establishment of a chain of settlements in the trans-Alleghany, a great human wall to withstand
the advancing wave of French influence and occupation. By the fifth decade of the century,
as we have seen, the Virginia settlers, with their squatter's claims and tomahawk rights, had
pushed on to the mountains; and great pressure was brought to bear upon the council to issue
grants for vast tracts of land in the uncharted wilderness of the interior.

At this period the English ministry adopted the aggressive policy already mentioned in connection
with the French and Indian war, indicative of a determination to contest with France the right
to occupy the interior of the continent. This policy had been inaugurated by Virginia with
the express purpose of stimulating the adoption of a similar policy by North Carolina and Pennsylvania.
Two land companies, organized almost simultaneously, actively promoted the preliminaries necessary
to settlement, despatching parties under expert leadership to discover the passes through the
mountains and to locate the best land in the trans-Alleghany.

In June, 1749, a great corporation, the Loyal Land Company of Virginia, received a grant of
eight hundred thousand acres above the North Carolina line and west of the mountains. Dr. Thomas
Walker, an expert surveyor, who in company with several other gentlemen had made a tour of
exploration through eastern Tennessee and the Holston region in 1748, was chosen as the agent
of this company. Starting from his home in Albemarle County, Virginia, March 6, 1750, accompanied
by five stalwart pioneers, Walker made a tour of exploration to the westward, being absent
four months and one week. On this journey, which carried the party as far west as the Rockcastle
River (May 11th) and as far north as the present Paintsville, Kentucky, they named many natural
objects, such as mountains and rivers, after members of the party. Their two principal achievements
were the erection of the first house built by white men between the Cumberland Mountains and
the Ohio River a feat, however, which led to no important developments; and the discovery of
the wonderful gap in the Alleghanies to which Walker gave the name Cumberland, in honor of
the ruthless conqueror at Culloden, the "bloody duke."

In 1748 the Ohio Company was organized by Colonel Thomas Lee, president of the Virginia council,
and twelve other gentlemen, of Virginia and Maryland. In their petition for five hundred thousand
acres, one of the declared objects of the company was "to anticipate the French by taking possession
of that country southward of the Lakes to which the French had no right...." By the royal order
of May 19, 1749, the company was awarded two hundred thousand acres, free of quit-rent for
ten years; and the promise was made of an additional award of the remainder petitioned for,
on condition of seating a hundred families upon the original grant and the building and maintaining
of a fort. Christopher Gist, summoned from his remote home on the Yadkin in North Carolina,
was instructed "to search out and discover the Lands upon the river Ohio & other adjoining
branches of the Mississippi down as low as the great Falls thereof." In this journey, which
began at Colonel Thomas Cresap's, in Maryland, in October, 1750, and ended at Gist's home on
May 18, 1751, Gist visited the Lower Shawnee Town and the Lower Blue Licks, ascended Pilot
Knob almost two decades before Find lay and Boone, from the same eminence, "saw with pleasure
the beautiful level of Kentucky," intersected Walker's route at two points, and crossed Cumberland
Mountain at Pound Gap on the return journey. This was a far more extended journey than Walker's,
enabling Gist to explore the fertile valleys of the Muskingum, Scioto, and Miami rivers and
to gain a view of the beautiful meadows of Kentucky.

It is eminently significant of the spirit of the age, which was inaugurating an era of land
hunger unparalleled in American history, that the first authentic records of the trans-Alleghany
were made by surveyors who visited the country as the agents of great land companies. The outbreak
of the French and Indian War so soon afterward delayed for a decade and more any important
colonization of the West. Indeed, the explorations and findings of Walker and Gist were almost
unknown, even to the companies they represented. But the conclusion of peace in 1763, which
gave all the region between the mountains and the Mississippi to the British, heralded the
true beginning of the westward expansionist movement in the Old Southwest, and inaugurated
the constructive leadership of North Carolina in f he occupation and colonization of the imperial
domain of Kentucky and the Ohio Valley.

In the middle years of the century many families of Virginia gentry removed to the back country
of North Carolina in the fertile region ranging from Williamsborough on the east to Hillsborough
on the west. There soon arose in this section of the colony a society marked by intellectual
distinction, social graces, and the leisured dignity of the landlord and the large planter.
So conspicuous for means, intellect, culture, and refinement were the people of this group,
having "abundance of wealth and leisure for enjoyment," that Governor Josiah Martin, in passing
through this region some years later, significantly observes: "They have great preeminence,
as well with respect to soil and cultivation, as to the manners and condition of the inhabitants,
in which last respect the difference is so great that one would be led to think them people
of another region." This new wealthy class which was now turning its gaze toward the unoccupied
lands along the frontier was "dominated by the democratic ideals of pioneers rather than by
the aristocratic tendencies of slave-holding planters." From the cross-fertilization of the
ideas of two social groups--this back-country gentry, of innate qualities of leadership, democratic
instincts, economic independence, and expansive tendencies, and the primitive pioneer society
of the frontier, frugal in taste, responsive to leadership, bold, ready, and thorough in execution--there
evolved the militant American expansion in the Old Southwest.

A conspicuous figure in this society of Virginia emigrants was a young man named Richard Henderson,
whose father had removed with his family from Hanover County, Virginia, to Bute, afterward
Granville County, North Carolina, in 1742. Educated at home by a private tutor, he began his
career as assistant of his father, Samuel Henderson, the High Sheriff of Granville County;
and after receiving a law-license, quickly acquired an extensive practice. "Even in the superior
courts where oratory and eloquence are as brilliant and powerful as in Westminster hall," records
an English acquaintance, "he soon became distinguished and eminent, and his superior genius
shone forth with great splendour, and universal applause." This young attorney, wedded to the
daughter of an Irish lord, often visited Salisbury on his legal circuit; and here he became
well acquainted with Squire Boone, one of the "Worshipfull Justices," and often appeared in
suits before him. By his son, the nomadic Daniel Boone, conspicuous already for his solitary
wanderings across the dark green mountains to the sun-lit valleys and boundless hunting-grounds
beyond, Henderson was from time to time regaled with bizarre and fascinating tales of western
exploration; and Boone, in his dark hour of poverty and distress, when he was heavily involved
financially, turned for aid to this friend and his partner, who composed the law-firm of Williams
and Henderson.

Boone's vivid descriptions of the paradise of the West stimulated Henderson's imaginative mind
and attracted his attention to the rich possibilities of unoccupied lands there. While the
Board of Trade in drafting the royal proclamation of October 7, 1763, forbade the granting
of lands in the vast interior, which was specifically reserved to the Indians, it was clearly
not their intention to set permanent western limits to the colonies. The prevailing opinion
among the shrewdest men of the period was well expressed by George Washington, who wrote his
agent for preempting western lands: "I can never look upon that proclamation in any other light
(but I say this between ourselves) than as a temporary expedient to quiet the minds of the
Indians." And again in 1767: "It (the proclamation of 1763) must fall, of course, in a few
years, especially when those Indians consent to our occupying the lands. Any person, therefore,
who neglects the present opportunity of hunting out good lands, and in some measure marking
out and distinguishing them for his own, in order to keep others from settling them, will never
regain it." Washington had added greatly to his holdings of bounty lands in the West by purchasing
at trivial prices the claims of many of the officers and soldiers. Three years later we find
him surveying extensive tracts along the Ohio and the Great Kanawha, and, with the vision of
the expansionist, making large plans for the establishment of a colony to be seated upon his
own lands. Henderson, too, recognized the importance of the great country west of the Appalachians. [footnote

Mr. Lord died a few years ago.

 Just
why Henderson and his associates did not act sooner upon the reports brought back by the hunters--Boone
and Scaggs and Callaway, who accompanied Boone in 1764 in the interest of the land company
"is not known; but in all probability the fragmentary nature of these reports, however glowing
and enthusiastic, was sufficient cause for the delay of five years before the land company,
through the agency of Boone and Findlay, succeeded in having a thorough exploration inside
of the Kentucky region. Delay was also caused by rival claims to the territory. In the Virginia
Gazette of December 1, 1768, Henderson must have read with astonishment not unmixed with dismay
that "the Six Nations and all their tributaries have granted a vast extent of country to his
majesty, and the Proprietaries of Pennsylvania, and settled an advantageous boundary line between
their hunting country and this, and the other colonies to the Southward as far as the Cherokee
River, for which they received the most valuable present in goods and dollars that was ever
given at any conference since the settlement of America." The news was now bruited about through
the colony of North Carolina, that the Cherokees were hot in their resentment because the Northern
Indians, the inveterate foes of the Cherokees and the perpetual disputants for the vast Middle
Ground of Kentucky, had received at the Treaty of Fort Stanwix, November 5, 1768, an immense
compensation from the crown for the territory which they, the Cherokees, claimed from time
immemorial. Only three weeks before, John Stuart, Superintendent for Indian Affairs in the
Southern Department, had negotiated with the Cherokees the Treaty of Hard Labor, South Carolina
(October 14th), by which Governor Tryon's line of 1767, from Reedy River to Tryon Mountain,
was continued direct to Colonel Chiswell's mine, the present Wytheville, Virginia, and thence
in a straight Brie to the mouth of the Great Kanawha. Thus at the close of the year 1768 the
crown through both royal governor and superintendent of Indian affairs acknowledged in fair
and open treaty the right of the Cherokees, whose Tennessee villages guarded the gateway, to
the valley lands east of the mountain barrier as well as to the dim mid-region of Kentucky.
In the very act of negotiating the Treaty of Fort Stanwix, Sir William Johnson privately acknowledged
that possession of the trans-Alleghany could be legally obtained only by extinguishing the
title of the Cherokees.

These conflicting claims soon led to collisions between the Indians and the company's settlers.
In the spring of 1769 occurred one of those incidents in the westward advance which, though
slight in itself, was to have a definite bearing upon the course of events in later years.
In pursuance of his policy, as agent of the Loyal Land Company, of promoting settlement upon
the company's lands, Dr. Thomas Walker, who had visited Powell's Valley the preceding year
and come into possession of a very large tract there, simultaneously made proposals to one
party of men including the Kirtleys, Captain Rucker, and others, and to another party led by
Joseph Martin, trader of Orange County, Virginia, afterward a striking figure in the Old Southwest.
The fevered race by these bands of eighteenth-century "sooners" for possession of an early
"Cherokee Strip" was won by the latter band, who at once took possession and began to clear;
so that when the Kirtleys arrived, Martin coolly handed them "a letter from Dr. Walker that
informed them that if we got to the valley first, we were to have 21,000 acres of land, and
they were not to interfere with us." Martin and his companions were delighted with the beautiful
valley at the base of the Cumberland, quickly "eat and destroyed 23 deer--15 bears--2 buffaloes
and a great quantity of turkeys," and entertained gentlemen from Virginia and Maryland who
desired to settle more than a hundred families there. The company reckoned, however, without
their hosts, the Cherokees, who, fortified by the treaty of Hard Labor (1768) which left this
country within the Indian reservation, were determined to drive Martin and his company out.
While hunting on the Cumberland River, northwest of Cumberland Gap, Martin and his company
were surrounded and disarmed by a party of Cherokees who said they had orders from Cameron,
the royal agent, to rob all white men hunting on their lands. When Martin and his party arrived
at their station in Powell's Valley, they found it broken up and their goods stolen by the
Indians, which left them no recourse but to return to the settlements in Virginia. It was not
until six years later that Martin, under the stable influence of the Transylvania Company,
was enabled to return to this spot and erect there the station which was to play an integral
part in the progress of westward expansion.

Before going on to relate Boone's explorations of Kentucky under the auspices of the land company,
it will be convenient to turn back for a moment and give some account of other hunters and
explorers who visited that territory between the time of its discovery by Walker and Gist and
the advent of Boone.

CHAPTER VIII. The Long Hunters in the Twilight Zone

The long Hunters principally resided in the upper countries of Virginia & North Carolina on
New River & Holston River, and when they intended to make a long Hunt (as they calls it) they
Collected near the head of Holston near whare Abingdon now stands....--General William Hall.

Before the coming of Walker and Gist in 1750 and 1751 respectively, the region now called Kentucky
had, as far as we know, been twice visited by the French, once in 1729 when Chaussegros de
Lery and his party visited the Big Bone Lick, and again in the summer of 1749 when the Baron
de Longueuil with four hundred and fifty-two Frenchmen and Indians, going to join Bienville
in an expedition against "the Cherickees and other Indians lying at the back of Carolina and
Georgia," doubtless encamped on the Kentucky shore of the Ohio. Kentucky was also traversed
by John Peter Salling with his three adventurous companions in their journey through the Middle
West in 1742. But all these early visits, including the memorable expeditions of Walker and
Gist, were so little known to the general public that when John Filson wrote the history of
Kentucky in 1784 he attributed its discovery to James McBride in 1754. More influential upon
the course of westward expansion was an adventure which occurred in 1752, the very year in
which the Boones settled down in their Vadkin home.

In the autumn of 1752, a Pennsylvania trader, John Findlay, with three or four companions,
descended the Ohio River in a canoe as far as the falls at the present Louisville, Kentucky,
and accompanied a party of Shawnees to their town of Es-kip-pa-ki-thi-ki, eleven miles east
of what is now Winchester.

This was the site of the "Indian Old Corn Field," the Iroquois name for which ("the place of
many fields," or "prairie") was Ken-take, whence came the name of the state.

Five miles east of this spot, where still may be seen a mound and an ellipse showing the outline
of the stockade, is the famous Pilot Knob, from the summit of which the fields surrounding
the town lie visible in their smooth expanse. During Findlay's stay at the Indian town other
traders from Pennsylvania and Virginia, who reported that they were "on their return from trading
with the Cuttawas (Catawbas), a nation who live in the Territories of Carolina," assembled
in the vicinity in January, 1753. Here, as the result of disputes arising from their barter,
they were set upon and captured by a large party of straggling Indians (Coghnawagas from Montreal)
on January 26th; but Findlay and another trader named James Lowry were so fortunate as to escape
and return through the wilderness to the Pennsylvania settlements." The incident is of important
historic significance; for it was from these traders, who must have followed the Great Warriors'
Path to the country of the Catawbas, that Findlay learned of the Ouasioto (Cumberland) Gap
traversed by the Indian path. His reminiscences of this gateway to Kentucky, of the site of
the old Indian town on Lulbegrud Creek, a tributary of the Red River, and of the Pilot Knobwere
sixteen years later to fire Boone to his great tour of exploration in behalf of the Transylvania
Company.

During the next two decades, largely because of the hostility of the savage tribes, only a
few traders and hunters from the east ranged through the trans-Alleghany. But in 1761, a party
of hunters led by a rough frontiersman, Elisha Walden, penetrated into Powell's Valley, followed
the Indian trail through Cumberland Gap, explored the Cumberland River, and finally reached
the Laurel Mountain where, encountering a party of Indians, they deemed it expedient to return.
With Walden went Henry Scaggs, afterward explorer for the Henderson Land Company, William Elevens
and Charles Cox, the famous Virginia hunters, one Newman, and some fifteen other stout pioneers.
Their itinerary may be traced from the names given to natural objects in honor of members of
the party--Walden's Mountain and Walden's Creek, Scaggs' Ridge and Newman's Ridge. Following
the peace of 1763, which made travel in this region moderately safe once more, the English
proceeded to occupy the territory which they had won. In 1765 George Croghan with a small party,
on the way to prepare the inhabitants of the Illinois country for transfer to English sovereignty,
visited the Great Bone Licks of Kentucky (May 30th, 31st); and a year later Captain Harry Gordon,
chief engineer in the Western Department in North America, visited and minutely described the
same licks and the falls. But these, and numerous other water-journeys and expeditions of which
no records were kept, though interesting enough in themselves, had little bearing upon the
larger phases of westward expansion and colonization.

The decade opening with the year 1765 is the epoch of bold and ever bolder exploration--the
more adventurous frontiersmen of the border pushing deep into the wilderness in search of game,
lured on by the excitements of the chase and the profit to be derived from the sale of peltries.
In midsummer, 1766, Captain James Smith, Joshua Horton, Uriah Stone, William Baker, and a young
mulatto slave passed through Cumberland Gap, hunted through the country south of the Cherokee
and along the Cumberland and Tennessee rivers, and as Smith reports "found no vestige of any
white man." During the same year a party of five hunters from South Carolina, led by Isaac
Lindsey, penetrated the Kentucky wilderness to the tributary of the Cumberland, named Stone's
River by the former party, for one of their number. Here they encountered two men, who were
among the greatest of the western pioneers, and were destined to leave their names in historic
association with the early settlement of Kentucky, James Harrod and Michael Stoner, a German,
both of whom had descended the Ohio from Fort Pitt. With the year 1769 began those longer and
more extended excursions into the interior which were to result in conveying at last to the
outside world graphic and detailed information concerning "the wonderful new country of Cantucky."
In the late spring of this year Hancock and Richard Taylor (the latter the father of President
Zachary Taylor), Abraham Hempinstall, and one Barbour, all true-blue frontiersmen, left their
homes in Orange County, Virginia, and hunted extensively in Kentucky and Arkansas. Two of the
party traveled through Georgia and East and West Florida; while the other two hunted on the
Washita during the winter of 1770-1. Explorations of this type became increasingly hazardous
as the animosity of the Indians increased; and from this time onward for a number of years
almost all the parties of roving hunters suffered capture or attack by the crafty red men.
In this same year Major John McCulloch, living on the south branch of the Potomac, set out
accompanied by a white man-servant and a negro, to explore the western country. While passing
down the Ohio from Pittsburgh McCulloch was captured by the Indians near the mouth of the Wabash
and carried to the present site of Terre Haute, Indiana. Set free after four or five months,
he journeyed in company with some French voyageurs first to Natchez and then to New Orleans,
whence he made the sea voyage to Philadelphia. Somewhat later, Benjamin Cleveland (afterward
famous in the Revolution), attended by four companions, set out from his home on the upper
Yadkin to explore the Kentucky wilderness. After passing through Cumberland Gap, they encountered
a band of Cherokees who plundered them of everything they had, even to their hats and shoes,
and ordered them to leave the Indian hunting-grounds. On their return journey they almost starved,
and Cleveland, who was reluctantly forced to kill his faithful little hunting-dog, was wont
to declare in after years that it was the sweetest meat he ever ate.

Fired to adventure by the glowing accounts brought back by Uriah Stone, a much more formidable
band than any that had hitherto ventured westward--including Uriah Stone as pilot, Gasper Mansker,
John Rains, Isaac Bledsoe, and a dozen others--assembled in June, 1769, in the New River region.
"Each Man carried two horses," says an early pioneer in describing one of these parties, "traps,
a large supply of powder and led, and a small hand vise and bellows, files and screw plate
for the purpose of fixing the guns if any of them should get out of fix." Passing through Cumberland
Gap, they continued their long journey until they reached Price's Meadow, in the present Wayne
County, Kentucky, where they established their encampment. In the course of their explorations,
during which they gave various names to prominent natural features, they established their
"station camp" on a creek in Sumner County, Tennessee, whence originated the name of Station
Camp Creek. Isaac Bledsoe and Gasper Mansker, agreeing to travel from here in opposite directions
along a buffalo trace passing near the camp, each succeeded in discovering the famous salt-lick
which bears his name--namely Bledsoe's Lick and Mansker's Lick. The flat surrounding the lick,
about one hundred acres in extent, discovered by Bledsoe, according to his own statement "was
principally Covered with buffelows in every direction--not hundreds but thousands." As he sat
on his horse, he shot down two deer in the lick; but the buffaloes blindly trod them in the
mud. They did not mind him and his horse except when the wind blew the scent in their nostrils,
when they would break and run in droves. Indians often lurked in the neighbourhood of these
hunters--plundering their camp, robbing them, and even shooting down one of their number, Robert
Crockett, from ambush. After many trials and vicissitudes, which included a journey to the
Spanish Natchez and the loss of a great mass of peltries when they were plundered by Piomingo
and a war party of Chickasaws, they finilly reached home in the late spring of 1770."

The most notable expedition of this period, projected under the auspices of two bold leaders
extraordinarily skilled in woodcraft, Joseph Drake and Henry Scaggs, was organized in the early
autumn of 1770. This imposing band of stalwart hunters from the New River and Holston country,
some forty in number, garbed in hunting shirts, leggings, and moccasins, with three pack-horses
to each man, rifles, ammunition, traps, dogs, blankets, and salt, pushed boldly through Cumberland
Gap into the heart of what was later justly named the "Dark and Bloody Ground" (see Chapter
XIV)--"not doubting," says an old border chronicler, "that they were to be encountered by Indians,
and to subsist on game." From the duration of their absence from home, they received the name
of the Long Hunters--the romantic appellation by which they are known in the pioneer history
of the Old Southwest. Many natural objects were named by this party--in particular Dick's River,
after the noted Cherokee hunter, Captain Dick, who, pleased to be recognized by Charles Scaggs,
told the Long Hunters that on HIS river, pointing it out, they would find meat plenty--adding
with laconic signifigance: "Kill it and go home." From the Knob Lick, in Lincoln County, as
reported by a member of the party, "they beheld largely over a thousand animals, including
buffaloe, elk, bear, and deer, with many wild turkies scattered among them; all quite restless,
some playing, and others busily employed in licking the earth.... The buffaloe and other animals
had so eaten away the soil, that they could, in places, go entirely underground." Upon the
return of a detachment to Virginia, fourteen fearless hunters chose to remain; and one day,
during the absence of some of the band upon a long exploring trip, the camp was attacked by
a straggling party of Indians under Will Emery, a halfbreed Cherokee. Two of the hunters were
carried into captivity and never heard of again; a third managed to escape. In embittered commemoration
of the plunder of the camp and the destruction of the peltries, they inscribed upon a poplar,
which had lost its bark, this emphatic record, followed by their names:

2300 Deer Skins lost Ruination by God

Undismayed by this depressing stroke of fortune, they continued their hunt in the direction
of the lick which Bledsoe had discovered the preceding year. Shortly after this discovery,
a French voyageur from the Illinois who had hunted and traded in this region for a decade,
Timothe de Monbreun, subsequently famous in the history of Tennessee, had visited the lick
and killed an enormous number of buffaloes for their tallow and tongues with which he and his
companion loaded a keel boat and descended the Cumberland. An early pioneer, William Hall,
learned from Isaac Bledsoe that when "the long hunters Crossed the ridge and came down on Bledsoe's
Creek in four or five miles of the Lick the Cane had grown up so thick in the woods that they
thought they had mistaken the place until they Came to the Lick and saw what had been done....
One could walk for several hundred yards a round the Lick and in the lick on buffellows Skuls,
& bones and the whole flat round the Lick was bleached with buffellows bones, and they found
out the Cause of the Canes growing up so suddenly a few miles around the Lick which was in
Consequence of so many buffellows being killed."

This expedition was of genuine importance, opening the eyes of the frontiersmen to the charms
of the country and influencing many to settle subsequently in the West, some in Tennessee,
some in Kentucky. The elaborate and detailed information brought back by Henry Scaggs exerted
an appreciable influence, no doubt, in accelerating the plans of Richard Henderson and Company
for the acquisition and colonization of the trans-Alleghany. But while the "Long Hunters" were
in Tennessee and Kentucky the same region was being more extensively and systematically explored
by Daniel Boone. To his life, character, and attainments, as the typical "long hunter" and
the most influential pioneer we may now turn our particular attention.

CHAPTER IX.

The wandering life of a border Nimrod in a surpassingly beautiful country teeming with game
was the ideal of the frontiersman of the eighteenth century. AS early as 1728, while running
the dividing line between North Carolina and Virginia, William Byrd encountered along the North
Carolina frontier the typical figure of the professional hunter: "a famous Woodsman, call'd
Epaphroditus Bainton. This Forester Spends all his time in ranging the Woods, and is said to
make great Havock among the Deer, and other Inhabitants of the Forest, not much wilder than
himself." By the middle of the century, as he was threading his way through the Carolina piedmont
zone, the hunter's paradise of the Yadkin and Catawba country, Bishop Spangenberg found ranging
there many hunters, living like Indians, who killed thousands of deer each year and sold the
skins in the local markets or to the fur-traders from Virginia whose heavy pack-trains with
their tinkling bells constantly traversed the course of the Great Trading Path. The superlative
skill of one of these hunters, both as woodsman and marksman, was proverbial along the border.
The name of Daniel Boone became synonymous with expert huntsmanship and almost uncanny wisdom
in forest lore. The bottoms of the creek near the Boone home, three miles west of present Mocksville,
contained a heavy growth of beech, which dropped large quantities of its rich nuts or mast,
greatly relished by bears; and this creek received its name, Bear Creek, because Daniel and
his father killed in its rich bottoms ninety-nine bears in a single hunting-season. After living
for a time with his young wife, Rebecca Bryan, in a cabin in his father's yard, Daniel built
a home of his own upon a tract of land, purchased from his father on October 12, 1759, and
lying on Sugar Tree, a tributary of Dutchman's Creek. Here he dwelt for the next five years,
with the exception of the period of his temporary removal to Virginia during the terrible era
of the Indian war. Most of his time during the autumn and winter, when he was not engaged in
wagoning or farming, he spent in long hunting-journeys into the mountains to the west and northwest.
During the hunting-season of 1760 he struck deeper than ever before into the western mountain
region and encamped in a natural rocky shelter amidst fine hunting-grounds, in what is now
Washington County in east Tennessee. Of the scores of inscriptions commemorative of his hunting-feats,
which Boone with pardonable pride was accustomed throughout his life time to engrave with his
hunting-knife upon trees and rocks, the earliest known is found upon a leaning beech tree,
only recently fallen, near his camp and the creek which since that day has borne his name.

Late in the summer of the following year Boone marched under the command of the noted Indian-fighter
of the border, Colonel Hugh Waddell, in his campaign against the Cherokees. From the lips of
Waddell, who was outspoken in his condemnation of Byrd's futile delays in road-cutting and
fort-building, Boone learned the true secret of success in Indian warfare, which was lost upon
Braddock, Forbes, and later St. Clair: that the art of defeating red men was to deal them a
sudden and unexpected blow, before they had time either to learn the strength of the force
employed against them or to lay with subtle craft their artful ambuscade.

In the late autumn of 1761, Daniel Boone and Nathaniel Gist, the son of Washington's famous
guide, who were both serving under Waddell, temporarily detached themselves from his command
and led a small party on a "long hunt" in the Valley of the Holston, While encamping near the
site of Black's Fort, subsequently built, they were violently assailed by a pack of fierce
wolves which they had considerable difficulty in beating off; and from this incident the locality
became known as Wolf Hills (now Abingdon, Virginia).

From this time forward Boone's roving instincts had full sway. For many months each year he
threaded his way through that marvelously beautiful country of western North Carolina felicitously
described as the Switzerland of America. Boone's love of solitude and the murmuring forest
was surely inspired by the phenomenal beauties of the country' through which he roamed at will.
Blowing Rock on one arm of a great horseshoe of mountains and Tryon Mountain upon the other
arm, overlooked an enormous, primeval bowl, studded by a thousand emerald-clad eminences. There
was the Pilot Mountain, the towering and isolated pile which from time immemorial had served
the aborigines as a guide in their forest wanderings; there was the dizzy height of the Roan
on the border; there was Mt. Mitchell, portentous in its grandeur, the tallest peak on the
continent east of the Rockies; and there was the Grandfather, the oldest mountain on earth
according to geologists, of which it has been written:

  Oldest of all terrestrial things--still holding
  Thy wrinkled forehead high;
  Whose every scam, earth's history enfolding,
  Grim science doth defy!

  Thou caught'st the far faint ray from Sirius rising,
  When through space first was hurled
  The primal gloom of ancient voids surprising,
  This atom, called the World!

What more gratifying to the eye of the wanderer than the luxuriant vegetation and lavish profusion
of the gorgeous flowers upon the mountain slopes, radiant rhododendron, rosebay, and laurel,
and the azalea rising like flame; or the rare beauties of the water--the cataract of Linville,
taking its shimmering leap into the gorge, and that romantic river poetically celebrated in
the lines:

  Swannanoa, nymph of beauty,
  I would woo thee in my rhyme,
  Wildest, brightest, loveliest river
  Of our sunny Southern clime.
     * * *
  Gone forever from the borders
  But immortal in thy name,
  Are the Red Men of the forest
  Be thou keeper of their fame!
  Paler races dwell beside thee,
  Celt and Saxon till thy lands
  Wedding use unto thy beauty
  Linking over thee their hands.

The long rambling excursions which Boone made through western North Carolina and eastern Tennessee
enabled him to explore every nook and corner of the rugged and beautiful mountain region. Among
the companions and contemporaries with whom he hunted and explored the country were his little
son James and his brother Jesse; the Linville who gave the name to the beautiful falls; Julius
Caesar Dugger, whose rock house stood near the head of Elk Creek; and Nathaniel Gist, who described
for him the lofty gateway to Kentucky, through which Christopher Gist had passed in 1751. Boone
had already heard of this gateway, from Findlay, and it was one of the secret and cherished
ambitions of his life to scale the mountain wall of the Appalachians and to reach that high
portal of the Cumberland which beckoned to the mysterious new Eden beyond. Go.'

Of Boone's preliminary explorations for the land company known as Richard Henderson and Company,
an account has already been given; and the delay in following them up has been touched on and
in part explained. Meanwhile Boone transferred his efforts for a time to another field. Toward
the close of the summer of 1765 a party consisting of Major John Field, William Hill, one Slaughter,
and two others, all from Culpeper County, Virginia, visited Boone and induced him to accompany
them on the "long Journey" to Florida, whither they were attracted by the liberal offer of
Colonel James Grant, governor of the eastern section, the Florida of to-day. On this long and
arduous expedition they suffered many hardships and endured many privations, found little game,
and on one occasion narrowly escaped starvation. They explored Florida from St. Augustine to
Pensacola; and Boone, who relished fresh scenes and a new environment, purchased a house and
lot in Pensacola in anticipation of removal thither. But upon his return home, finding his
wife unwilling to go, Boone once more turned his eager eye toward the West, that mysterious
and alluring region beyond the great range, the fabled paradise of Kentucky.

The following year four young men from the Yadkin, Benjamin Cutbird, John Stewart (Boone's
brother-in-law who afterwards accompanied him to Kentucky), John Baker, and James Ward made
a remarkable journey to the westward, crossing the Appalachian mountain chain over some unknown
route, and finally reaching the Mississippi. The significance of the journey, in its bearing
upon westward expansion, inheres in the fact that while for more than half a century the English
traders from South Carolina had been winning their way to the Mississippi along the lower routes
and Indian trails, this was the first party from either of the Carolinas, as far as is known,
that ever reached the Mississippi by crossing the great mountain barrier. When Cutbird, a superb
woodsman and veritable Leather stocking, narrated to Boone the story of his adventures, it
only confirmed Boone in his determination to find the passage through the mountain chain leading
to the Mesopotamia of Kentucky.

Such an enterprise was attended by terrible dangers. During 1766 and 1767 the steady encroachments
of the white settlers upon the ancestral domain which the Indians reserved for their imperial
hunting-preserve aroused bitter feelings of resentment among the red men. Bloody reprisal was
often the sequel to such encroachment. The vast region of Tennessee and the trans-Alleghany
was a twilight zone, through which the savages roamed at will. From time to time war parties
of northern Indians, the inveterate foes of the Cherokees, scouted through this no-man's land
and even penetrated into the western region of North Carolina, committing murders and depredations
upon the Cherokees and the whites indiscriminately. During the summer of 1766, while Boone's
friend and close connection, Captain William Linville, his son John, and another young man,
named John Williams, were in camp some ten miles below Linville Falls, they were unexpectedly
fired upon by a hostile band of Northern Indians, and before they had time to fire a shot,
a second volley killed both the Linvilles and severely wounded Williams, who after extraordinary
sufferings finally reached the settlements." In May, 1767, four traders and a half-breed child
of one of them were killed in the Cherokee country. In the summer of this year Governor William
Tryon of North Carolina laid out the boundary line of the Cherokees, and upon his return issued
a proclamation forbidding any purchase of land from the Indians and any issuance of grants
for land within one mile of the boundary line. Despite this wise precaution, seven North Carolina
hunters who during the following September had lawlessly ventured into the mountain region
some sixty miles beyond the boundary were fired upon, and several of them killed, by the resentful
Cherokees Undismayed by these signs of impending danger, undeterred even by the tragic fate
of the Linvilles, Daniel Boone, with the determination of the indomitable pioneer, never dreamed
of relinquishing his long-cherished design. Discouraged by the steady disappearance of game
under the ruthless attack of innumerable hunters, Boone continued to direct his thoughts toward
the project of exploring the fair region of Kentucky. The adventurous William Hill, to whom
Boone communicated his purpose, readily consented to go with him; and in the autumn of 1768
Boone and Hill, accompanied, it is believed, by Squire Boone, Daniel's brother, set forth upon
their almost inconceivably hazardous expedition. They crossed the Blue Ridge and the Alleghanies,
the Holston and Clinch rivers near their sources, and finally reached the head waters of the
West Fork of the Big Sand. Surmising from its course that this stream must flow into the Ohio,
they pushed on a hundred miles to the westward and finally, by following a buffalo path, reached
a salt-spring in what is now Floyd County, in the extreme eastern section of Kentucky. Here
Boone beheld great droves of buffalo that visited the salt-spring to drink the water or lick
the brackish soil. After spending the winter in hunting and trapping, the Boones and Hill,
discouraged by the forbidding aspect of the hill-country which with its dense growth of laurel
was exceedingly difficult to penetrate, abandoned all hope of finding Kentucky by this route
and wended their arduous way back to the Yadkin.

The account of Boone's subsequent accomplishment of his purpose must be postponed to the next
chapter.

CHAPTER X. Daniel Boone in Kentucky

He felt very much as Columbus did, gazing from his caravel on San Salvador; as Cortes, looking
down, from the crest of Ahualco, on the Valley of Mexico; or Vasco Nunez, standing alone on
the peak of Darien, and stretching his eyes over the hitherto undiscovered waters of the Pacific.---William
Gilmore Simms: Views and Reviews.

A chance acquaintance formed by Daniel Boone, during the French and Indian War, with the Irish
lover of adventure, John Findlay, was the origin of Boone's cherished longing to reach the
El Dorado of the West. In this slight incident we may discern the initial inspiration for the
epochal movement of westward expansion. Findlay was a trader and horse peddler, who had early
migrated to Carlisle, Pennsylvania. He had been licensed a trader with the Indians in 1747.
During the same year he was married to Elizabeth Harris, daughter of John Harris, the Indian-trader
at Harris's Ferry on the Susquehanna River, after whom Harrisburg was named. During the next
eight years Findlay carried on his business of trading in the interior. Upon the opening of
the French and Indian War he was probably among "the young men about Paxtang who enlisted immediately,"
and served as a waggoner in Braddock's expedition. Over the campfires, during the ensuing campaign
in 1765, young Boone was an eager listener to Findlay's stirring narrative of his adventures
in the Ohio Valley and on the wonderfully beautiful levels of Kentucky in 1752. The fancies
aroused in his brooding mind by Findlay's moving recital and his description of an ancient
passage through the Ouasioto or Cumberland Gap and along the course of the Warrior's Path,
inspired him with an irrepressible longing to reach that alluring promised land which was the
perfect realization of the hunter's paradise.

Thirteen years later, while engaged in selling pins, needles, thread, and Irish linens in the
Yadkin country, Findlay learned from the Pennsylvania settlers at Salisbury or at the Forks
of the Yadkin of Boone's removal to the waters of the upper Yadkin. At Boone's rustic home,
in the winter of 1768-9, Findlay visited his old comrade-in-arms of Braddock's campaign. On
learning of Boone's failure during the preceding year to reach the Kentucky levels by way of
the inhospitable Sandy region, Findlay again described to him the route through the Ouasioto
Gap traversed sixteen years before by Pennsylvania traders in their traffic with the Catawbas.
Boone, as we have seen, knew that Christopher Gist, who had formerly lived near him on the
upper Yadkin, had found some passage through the lofty mountain defiles; but he had never been
able to discover the passage. Findlay's renewed descriptions of the immense herds of buffaloes
he had seen in Kentucky, the great salt-licks where they congregated, the abundance of bears,
deer, and elk with which the country teemed, the innumerable flocks of wild turkeys, geese,
and ducks, aroused in Boone the hunter's passion for the chase; while the beauty of the lands,
as mirrored in the vivid fancy of the Irishman, inspired him with a new longing to explore
the famous country which had, as John Filson records, "greatly engaged Mr. Findlay's attention."

In the comprehensive designs of Henderson, now a judge, for securing a "graphic report of the
trans-Alleghany region in behalf of his land company", Boone divined the means of securing
the financial backing for an expedition of considerable size and ample equipment. In numerous
suits for debt, aggregating hundreds of dollars, which had been instituted against Boone by
some of the leading citizens of Rowan, Williams and Henderson had acted as Boone's attorneys.
In order to collect their legal fees, they likewise brought suit against Boone; but not wishing
to press the action against the kindly scout who had hitherto acted as their agent in western
exploration, they continued the litigation from court to court, in lieu of certain "conditions
performed" on behalf of Boone, during his unbroken absence, by his attorney in this suit, Alexander
Martin. Summoned to appear in 1769 at the March term of court at Salisbury, Boone seized upon
the occasion to lay before Judge Henderson the designs for a renewed and extended exploration
of Kentucky suggested by the golden opportunity of securing the services of Findlay as guide.
Shortly after March 6th, when Judge Henderson reached Salisbury, the conference, doubtless
attended by John Stewart, Boone's brother-in-law, John Findlay, and Boone, who were all present
at this term of court, must have been held, for the purpose of devising ways and means for
the expedition. Peck, the only reliable contemporary biographer of the pioneer, who derived
many facts from Boone himself and his intimate acquaintances, draws the conclusion (1847):
"Daniel Boone was engaged as the master spirit of this exploration, because in his judgment
and fidelity entire confidence could be reposed.... He was known to Henderson and encouraged
by him to make the exploration, and to examine particularly the whole country south of the
Kentucky--or as then called the Louisa River." As confidential agent of the land company, Boone
carried with him letters and instructions for his guidance upon this extended tour of exploration."

On May 1, 1769, with Findlay as guide, and accompanied by four of his neighbors, John Stewart,
a skilled woodsman, Joseph Holden, James Mooney, and William Cooley, Boone left his "peaceable
habitation" on the upper Yadkin and began his historic journey "in quest of the country of
Kentucky." Already heavily burdened with debts, Boone must have incurred considerable further
financial obligations to Judge Henderson and Colonel Williams, acting for the land company,
in order to obtain the large amount of supplies requisite for so prolonged an expedition. Each
of the adventurers rode a good horse of strength and endurance; and behind him were securely
strapped the blanket, ammunition, salt, and cooking-utensils so indispensable for a long sojourn
in the wilderness. In Powell's Valley they doubtless encountered the party led thither by Joseph
Martin (see Chapter VII), and there fell into the "Hunter's Trail" commented on in a letter
written by Martin only a fortnight before the passing of Boone's cavalcade. Crossing the mountain
at the Ouasioto Gap, they made their first "station camp" in Kentucky on the creek, still named
after that circumstance, on the Red Lick Fork. After a preliminary journey for the purpose
of locating the spot, Findlay led the party to his old trading-camp at Es-kip-pa-ki-thi-ki,
where then (June 7, 1769) remained but charred embers of the Indian huts, with some of the
stockading and the gate-posts still standing. In Boone's own words, he and Findlay at once
"proceeded to take a more thorough survey of the country;" and during the autumn and early
winter, encountering on every hand apparently inexhaustible stocks of wild game and noting
the ever-changing beauties of the country, the various members of the party made many hunting
and exploring journeys from their "station camp" as base. On December 22, 1769, while engaged
in a hunt, Boone and Stewart were surprised and captured by a large party of Shawanoes, led
by Captain Will, who were returning from the autumn hunt on Green River to their villages north
of the Ohio. Boone and Stewart were forced to pilot the Indians to their main camp, where the
savages, after robbing them of all their peltries and supplies and leaving them inferior guns
and little ammunition, set off to the northward. They left, on parting, this menacing admonition
to the white intruders: "Now, brothers, go home and stay there. Don't come here any more, for
this is the Indians' hunting-ground, and all the animals, skins, and furs are ours. If you
are so foolish as to venture here again, you may be sure the wasps and yellow jackets will
sting you severely."

Chagrined particularly by the loss of the horses, Boone and Stewart for two days pursued the
Indians in hot haste. Finally approaching the Indians' camp by stealth in the dead of night,
they secured two of the horses, upon which they fled at top speed. In turn they were immediately
pursued by a detachment of the Indians, mounted upon their fleetest horses; and suffered the
humiliation of recapture two days later. Indulging in wild hilarity over the capture of the
crestfallen whites, the Indians took a bell from one of the horses and, fastening it about
Boone's neck, compelled him under the threat of brandished tomahawks to caper about and jingle
the bell, jeering at him the while with the derisive query, uttered in broken English: "Steal
horse, eh?" With as good grace as they could summon--wry smiles at best--Boone and Stewart
patiently endured these humiliations, following the Indians as captives. Some days later (about
January 4, 1770), while the vigilance of the Indians was momentarily relaxed, the captives
suddenly plunged into a dense canebrake and in the subsequent confusion succeeded in effecting
their escape. Finding their camp deserted upon their return, Boone and Stewart hastened on
and finally overtook their companions. Here Boone was both surprised and delighted to encounter
his brother Squire, loaded down with supplies. Having heard nothing from Boone, the partners
of the land company had surmised that he and his party must have run short of ammunition, flour,
salt, and other things sorely needed in the wilderness; and because of their desire that the
party should remain, in order to make an exhaustive exploration of the country, Squire Boone
had been sent to him with supplies. Findlay, Holden, Mooney, and Cooley returned to the settlements;
but Stewart, Squire Boone, and Alexander Neely, who had accompanied Squire, threw in their
lot with the intrepid Daniel, and fared forth once more to the stirring and bracing adventures
of the Kentucky wilderness. In Daniel Boone's own words, he expected "from the furs and peltries
they had an opportunity of taking ... to recruit his shattered circumstances; discharge the
debts he had contracted by the adventure; and shortly return under better auspices, to settle
the newly discovered country."

Boone and his party now stationed themselves near the mouth of the Red River, and soon provided
themselves, against the hard. ships of the long winter, with jerk, bear's oil, buffalo tallow,
dried buffalo tongues, fresh meat, and marrow-bones as food, and buffalo robes and bearskins
as shelter from the inclement weather. A young man of our company called Alexander Neely came
to camp and told us he had been that day to Lulbegrud, and had killed two Brobdignags in their
capital." Far from unlettered were pioneers who indulged together in such literary chat and
gave to the near-by creek the name (after Dean Swift's Lorbrugrud) of Lulbegrud which name,
first seen on Filson's map of Kentucky (1784), it bears to this day. From one of his long,
solitary hunts Stewart never returned; and it was not until five years later, while cutting
out the Transylvania Trail, that Boone and his companions discovered, near the old crossing
at Rockcastle, Stewart's remains in a standing hollow sycamore. The wilderness never gave up
its tragic secret.

The close of the winter and most of the spring were passed by the Boones, after Neely's return
to the settlements, in exploration, hunting, and trapping beaver and otter, in which sport
Daniel particularly excelled. Owing to the drain upon their ammunition, Squire was at length
compelled to return to the settlements for supplies; and Daniel, who remained alone in the
wilderness to complete his explorations for the land company, must often have shared the feelings
of Balboa as, from lofty knob or towering ridge, he gazed over the waste of forest which spread
from the dim out lines of the Alleghanies to the distant waters of the Mississippi. He now
proceeded to make those remarkable solitary explorations of Kentucky which have given him immortality--through
the valley of the Kentucky and the Licking, and along the "Belle Riviere" (Ohio) as low as
the falls. He visited the Big Bone Lick and examined the wonderful fossil remains of the mammoth
found there. Along the great buffalo roads, worn several feet below the surface of the ground,
which led to the Blue Licks, he saw with amazement and delight thousands of huge shaggy buffalo
gamboling, bellowing, and making the earth rumble beneath the trampling of their hooves. One
day, while upon a cliff near the junction of the Kentucky and Dick's Rivers, he suddenly found
himself hemmed in by a party of Indians. Seizing his only chance of escape, he leaped into
the top of a maple tree growing beneath the cliffs and, sliding to safety full sixty feet below,
made his escape, pursued by the sound of a chorus of guttural "Ughs" from the dumbfounded savages.

Finally making his way back to the old camp, Daniel was rejoined there by Squire on July 27,
1770. During the succeeding months, much of their time was spent in hunting and prospecting
in Jessamine County, where two caves are still known as Boone's caves. Eventually, when ammunition
and supplies had once more run low, Squire was compelled a second time to return to the settlements.
Perturbed after a time by Squire's failure to rejoin him at the appointed time, Daniel started
toward the settlements, in search of him; and by a stroke of good fortune encountered him along
the trail. Overjoyed at this meeting (December, 1770) the indomitable Boones once more plunged
into the wilderness, determined to conclude their explorations by examining the regions watered
by the Green and Cumberland rivers and their tributaries. In after years, Gasper Mansker, the
old German scout, was accustomed to describe with comic effect the consternation created among
the Long Hunters, while hunting one day on Green River, by a singular noise which they could
not explain. Stealthily slipping from tree to tree, Mansker finally beheld with mingled surprise
and amusement a hunter, bareheaded, stretched flat upon his back on a deerskin spread on the
ground, singing merrily at the top of his voice! It was Daniel Boone, joyously whiling away
the solitary hours in singing one of his favorite songs of the border. In March, 1771, after
spending some time in company with the Long Hunters, the Boones, their horses laden with furs,
set their faces homeward. On their return journey, near Cumberland Gap, they had the misfortune
to be surrounded by a party of Indians who robbed them of their guns and all their peltries.
With this humiliating conclusion to his memorable tour of exploration, Daniel Boone, as he
himself says, "once more reached home after experiencing hardships which would defy credulity
in the recital."

Despite the hardships and the losses, Boone had achieved the ambition of years: he had seen
Kentucky, which he "esteemed a second paradise." The reports of his extended explorations,
which he made to Judge Henderson, were soon communicated to the other partners of the land
company; and their letters of this period, to one another, bristle with glowing and minute
descriptions of the country, as detailed by their agent. Boone was immediately engaged to act
in the company's behalf to sound the Cherokees confidentially with respect to their willingness
to lease or sell the beautiful hunting-grounds of the trans-Alleghany. The high hopes of Henderson
and his associates at last gave promise of brilliant realization. Daniel Boone's glowing descriptions
of Kentucky excited in their minds, says a gifted early chronicler, the "spirit of an enterprise
which in point of magnitude and peril, as well as constancy and heroism displayed in its execution,
has never been paralleled in the history of America."

CHAPTER XI. The Regulators

It is not a persons labour, nor yet his effects that will do, but if he has but one horse to
plow with, one bed to lie on, or one cow to give a little milk for his children, they must
all go to raise money which is not to be had. And lastly if his personal estate (sold at one
tenth of its value) will not do, then his lands (which perhaps has cost him many years of toil
and labour) must go the same way to satisfy, these cursed hungry caterpillars, that are eating
and will eat out the bowels of our Commonwealth, if they be not pulled down from their nests
in a very short time.--George Sims: A Serious Address to the Inhabitants of Granville County,
containing an Account of our deplorable Situation we suffer .... and some necessary Hints with
Respect to a Reformation. June 6, 1765.

It is highly probable that even at the time of his earlier explorations in behalf of Richard
Henderson and Company, Daniel Boone anticipated speedy removal to the West. Indeed, in the
very year of his first tour in their interest, Daniel and his wife Rebeckah sold all their
property in North Carolina, consisting of their home and six hundred and forty acres of land,
and after several removals established themselves upon the upper Yadkin. This removal and the
later western explorations just outlined were due not merely to the spirit of adventure and
discovery. Three other causes also were at work. In the first place there was the scarcity
of game. For fifteen years the shipments of deerskins from Bethabara to Charleston steadily
increased; and the number of skins bought by Gammern, the Moravian storekeeper, ran so high
that in spite of the large purchases made at the store by the hunters he would sometimes run
entirely out of money. Tireless in the chase, the far roaming Boone was among "the hunters,
who brought in their skins from as far away as the Indian lands"; and the beautiful upland
pastures and mountain forests, still teeming with deer and bear, doubtless lured him to the
upper Yadkin, where for a time in the immediate neighborhood of his home abundance of game
fell before his unerring rifle. Certainly the deer and other game, which were being killed
in enormous numbers to satisfy the insatiable demand of the traders at Salisbury, the Forks,
and Bethabara, became scarcer and scarcer; and the wild game that was left gradually fled to
the westward. Terrible indeed was the havoc wrought among the elk; and it was reported that
the last elk was killed in western North Carolina as early as 1781.

Another grave evil of the time with which Boone had to cope in the back country of North Carolina
was the growth of undisguised outlawry, similar to that found on the western plains of a later
era. This ruthless brigand age arose as the result of the unsettled state of the country and
the exposed condition of the settlements due to the Indian alarms. When rude borderers, demoralized
by the enforced idleness attendant upon fort life during the dark days of Indian invasion,
sallied forth upon forays against the Indians, they found much valuable property--horses, cattle,
and stock--left by their owners when hurriedly fleeing to the protection of the frontier stockades.
The temptations thus afforded were too great to resist; and the wilder spirits of the backwoods,
with hazy notions of private rights, seized the property which they found, slaughtered the
cattle, sold the horses, and appropriated to their own use the temporarily abandoned household
goods and plantation tools. The stealing of horses, which were needed for the cultivation of
the soil and useful for quickly carrying unknown thieves beyond the reach of the owner and
the law, became a common practice; and was carried on by bands of outlaws living remote from
one another and acting in collusive concert.

Toward the end of July, 1755, when the Indian outrages upon the New River settlements in Virginia
had frightened away all the families at the Town Fork in the Yadkin country, William Owen,
a man of Welsh stock, who had settled in the spring of 1752 in the upper Yadkin near the Mulberry
Fields, was suspected of having robbed the storekeeper on the Meho. Not long afterward a band
of outlaws who plundered the exposed cabins in their owners' absence, erected a rude fort in
the mountain region in the rear of the Yadkin settlements, where they stored their ill-gotten
plunder and made themselves secure from attack. Other members of the band dwelt in the settlements,
where they concealed their robber friends by day and aided them by night in their nefarious
projects of theft and rapine.

The entire community was finally aroused by the bold depredations of the outlaws; and the most
worthy settlers of the Yadkin country organized under the name of Regulators to break up the
outlaw band. When it was discovered that Owen, who was well known at Bethabara, had allied
himself with the highwaymen, one of the justices summoned one hundred men; and seventy, who
answered the call, set forth on December 26, 1755, to seek out the outlaws and to destroy their
fortress. Emboldened by their success, the latter upon one occasion had carried off a young
girl of the settlements. Daniel Boone placed himself at the head of one of the parties, which
included the young girl's father, to go to her rescue; and they fortunately succeeded in effecting
the release of the frightened maiden. One of the robbers was apprehended and brought to Salisbury,
where he was thrown into prison for his crimes. Meanwhile a large amount of plunder had been
discovered at the house of one Cornelius Howard; and the evidences of his guilt so multiplied
against him that he finally confessed his connection with the outlaw band and agreed to point
out their fort in the mountains.

Daniel Boone and George Boone joined the party of seventy men, sent out by the colonial authorities
under the guidance of Howard, to attack the stronghold of the bandits. Boone afterward related
that the robbers' fort was situated in the most fitly chosen place for such a purpose that
he could imagine--beneath an overhanging cliff of rock, with a large natural chimney, and a
considerable area in front well stockaded. The frontiersmen surrounded the fort, captured five
women and eleven children, and then burned the fort to the ground. Owen and his wife, Cumberland,
and several others were ultimately made prisoners; but Harman and the remainder of the band
escaped by flight. Owen and his fellow captives were then borne to Salisbury, incarcerated
in the prison there, and finally (May, 1756) condemned to the gallows. Owen sent word to the
Moravians, petitioning them to adopt his two boys and to apprentice one to a tailor, the other
to a carpenter. But so infuriated was Owen's wife by Howard's treachery that she branded him
as a second Judas; and this at once fixed upon him the sobriquet "Judas" Howard-a sobriquet
he did not live long to bear, for about a year later he was ambushed and shot from his horse
at the crossing of a stream. He thus paid the penalty of his betrayal of the outlaw band. For
a number of years, the Regulators continued to wage war against the remaining outlaws, who
from time to time committed murders as well as thefts. As late as January, 1768, the Regulators
caught a horse thief in the Hollows of Surry County and brought him to Bethabara, whence Richter
and Spach took him to the jail at Salisbury. After this year, the outlaws were heard of no
more; and peace reigned in the settlements.

Colonel Edmund Fanning--of whom more anon--declared that the Regulation began in Anson County
which bordered upon South Carolina. Certain it is that the upper country of that province was
kept in an uproar by civil disturbances during this early period. Owing to the absence of courts
in this section, so remote from Charleston, the inhabitants found it necessary, for the protection
of property and the punishment of outlaws, to form an association called, like the North Carolina
society, the Regulation. Against this association the horse thieves and other criminals made
common cause, and received tacit support from certain more reputable persons who condemned
"the irregularity of the Regulators." The Regulation which had been thus organized in upper
South Carolina as early as 1764 led to tumultuous risings of the settlers; and finally in the
effort to suppress these disorders, the governor, Lord Charles Montagu, appointed one Scovil,
an utterly unworthy representative, to carry out his commands. After various disorders, which
became ever more unendurable to the law-abiding, matters came to a crisis (1769) as the result
of the high-handed proceedings of Scovil, who promiscuously seized and flung into prison all
the Regulators he could lay hands on. In the month of March the back country rose in revolt
against Scovil and a strong body of the settlers was on the point of attacking the force under
his command when an eleventh-hour letter arrived from Montagu, dismissing Scovil from office.
Thus was happily averted, by the narrowest of margins, a threatened precursor of the fight
at Alamance in 1771 (see Chapter XII). As the result of the petition of the Calhouns and others,
courts were established in 1760, though not opened until four years later. Many horse thieves
were apprehended, tried, and punished. Justice once more held full sway.

Another important cause for Boone's removal from the neighborhood of Salisbury into the mountain
fastnesses was the oppressive administration of the law by corrupt sheriffs, clerks, and tax-gatherers,
and the dissatisfaction of the frontier squatters with the owners of the soil. At the close
of the year 1764 reports reached the town of Wilmington, after the adjournment of the assembly
in November, of serious disturbances in Orange County, due, it was alleged, to the exorbitant
exactions of the clerks, registers, and some of the attorneys. As a result of this disturbing
news, Governor Dobbs issued a proclamation forbidding any officer to take illegal fees. Troubles
had been brewing in the adjacent county of Granville ever since the outbreak of the citizens
against Francis Corbin, Lord Granville's agent (January 24, 1759), and the issuance of the
petition of Reuben Searcy and others (March 23d) protesting against the alleged excessive fees
taken and injustices practised by Robert (Robin) Jones, the famous lawyer. These disturbances
were cumulative in their effect; and the people at last (1765 ) found in George Sims, of Granville,
a fit spokesman of their cause and a doughty champion of popular rights. After describing in
detail the system of semi-peonage created by the merciless exactions of lawyers and petty court
officials, and the insatiable greed of "these cursed hungry caterpillars," Sims with rude eloquence
calls upon the people to pull them down from their nests for the salvation of the Commonwealth.

Other abuses were also recorded. So exorbitant was the charge for a marriage-license, for instance,
that an early chronicler records "The consequence was that some of the inhabitants on the head-waters
of the Yadkin took a short cut. They took each other for better or for worse; and considered
themselves as married without further ceremony." The extraordinary scarcity of currency throughout
the colony, especially in the back country, was another great hardship and a perpetual source
of vexation. All these conditions gradually became intolerable to the uncultured but free spirited
men of the back country. Events were slowly converging toward a crisis in government and society.
Independent in spirit, turbulent in action, the backwoodsmen revolted not only against excessive
taxes, dishonest sheriffs, and extortionate fees, but also against the rapacious practices
of the agents of Lord Granville. These agents industriously picked flaws in the titles to the
lands in Granville's proprietary upon which the poorer settlers were seated; and compelled
them to pay for the land if they had not already done so, or else to pay the fees twice over
and take out a new patent as the only remedy of the alleged defect in their titles. In Mecklenburg
County the spirit of backwoods revolt flamed out in protest against the proprietary agents.
Acting under instructions to survey and close bargains for the lands or else to eject those
who held them, Henry Eustace McCulloh, in February, 1765, went into the county to call a reckoning.
The settlers, many of whom had located without deeds, indignantly retorted by offering to buy
only at their own prices, and forbade the surveyors to lay out the holdings when this smaller
price was declined. They not only terrorized into acquiescence those among them who were willing
to pay the amount charged for the lands, but also openly declared that they would resist by
force any sheriff in ejectment proceedings. On May 7th an outbreak occurred; and a mob, led
by Thomas Polk, set upon John Frohock, Abraham Alexander, and others, as they were about to
survey a parcel of land, and gave them a severe thrashing, even threatening the young McCulloh
with death.

The choleric backwoodsmen, instinctively in agreement with Francis Bacon, considered revenge
as a sort of wild justice. Especial objects of their animosity were the brothers Frohock, John
and Thomas, the latter clerk of the court at Salisbury, and Edmund Fanning, a cultured gentleman-adventurer,
associate justice of the superior court. So rapacious and extortionate were these vultures
of the courts who preyed upon the vitals of the common people, that they were savagely lampooned
by Rednap Howell, the backwoods poet-laureate of the Regulation. The temper of the back country
is well caught in Howell's lines anent this early American "grafter", the favorite of the royal
governor:

  When Fanning first to Orange came,
  He looked both pale and wan;
  An old patched coat was on his back,
  An old mare he rode on.

  Both man and mare wan't worth five pounds,
  As I've been often told;
  But by his civil robberies,
  He's laced his coat with gold.

The germs of the great westward migration in the coming decade were thus working among the
people of the back country. If the tense nervous energy of the American people is the transmitted
characteristic of the border settlers, who often slept with loaded rifle in hand in grim expectation
of being awakened by the hideous yells, the deadly tomahawk, and the lurid firebrand of the
savage, the very buoyancy of the national character is in equal measure "traceable to the free
democracy founded on a freehold inheritance of land." The desire for free land was the fundamental
factor in the development of the American democracy. No colony exhibited this tendency more
signally than did North Carolina in the turbulent days of the Regulation. The North Carolina
frontiersmen resented the obligation to pay quit-rents and firmly believed that the first occupant
of the soil had an indefeasible right to the land which he had won with his rifle and rendered
productive by the implements of toil. Preferring the dangers of the free wilderness to the
paying of tribute to absentee landlords and officials of an intolerant colonial government,
the frontiersman found title in his trusty rifle rather than in a piece of parchment, and was
prone to pay his obligations to the owner of the soil in lead rather than in gold.

CHAPTER XII. Watauga--Haven of Liberty

The Regulators despaired of seeing better times and therefore quitted the Province. It is said
1,500 departed since the Battle of Alamance and to my knowledge a great many more are only
waiting to dispose of their plantations in order to follow them.--Reverend Morgan Edwards, 1772.

The five years (1766-1771) which saw the rise, development, and ultimate defeat of the popular
movement known as the Regulation, constitute a period not only of extraordinary significance
in North Carolina but also of fruitful consequences in the larger movements of westward expansion.
With the resolute intention of having their rulers "give account of their stewardship," to
employ their own words, the Sandy Creek Association of Baptists (organized in 1758), in a series
of papers known as Regulators' Advertisements (1766-8) proceeded to mature, through popular
gatherings, a rough form of initiative and referendum. At length, discouraged in its efforts,
and particularly in the attempt to bring county officials to book for charging illegal fees,
this association ceased actively to function. It was the precursor of a movement of much more
drastic character and formidable proportions, chiefly directed against Colonel Edmund Fanning
and his associates. This movement doubtless took its name, "the Regulation," from the bands
of men already described who were organized first in North Carolina and later in South Carolina,
to put down highwaymen and to correct many abuses in the back country, such as the tyrannies
of Scovil and his henchmen. Failing to secure redress of their grievances through legal channels,
the Regulators finally made such a powerful demonstration in support of their refusal to pay
taxes that Governor William Tryon of North Carolina, in 1768, called out the provincial militia,
and by marching with great show of force through the disaffected regions, succeeded temporarily
in overawing the people and thus inducing them to pay their assessments.

The suits which had been brought by the Regulators against Edmund Fanning, register, and Francis
Nash, clerk, of Orange County, resulted in both being "found guilty of taking too high fees."
Fanning immediately resigned his commission as register; while Nash, who in conjunction with
Fanning had fairly offered in 1766 to refund to any one aggrieved any fee charged by him which
the Superior Court might hold excessive, gave bond for his appearance at the next court. Similar
suits for extortion against the three Froliocks in Rowan County in 1769 met with failure, however;
and this outcome aroused the bitter resentment of the Regulators, as recorded by Herman Husband
in his "Impartial Relation." During this whole period the insurrectionary spirit of the people,
who felt themselves deeply aggrieved but recognized their inability to secure redress, took
the form of driving local justices from the bench and threatening court officials with violence.

At the session of the Superior Court at Hillsborough, September 22, 1770, an elaborate petition
prepared by the Regulators, demanding unprejudiced juries and the public accounting for taxes
by the sheriffs, was handed to the presiding justice by James Hunter, a leading Regulator.
This justice was our acquaintance, Judge Richard Henderson, of Granville County, the sole high
officer in the provincial government from the entire western section of the colony. In this
petition occur these trenchant words: "As we are serious and in good earnest and the cause
respects the whole body of the people it would be loss of time to enter into arguments on particular
points for though there are a few men who have the gift and art of reasoning, yet every man
has a feeling and knows when he has justice done him as well as the most learned." On the following
Monday (September 24th), upon convening of court, some one hundred and fifty Regulators, led
by James Hunter, Herman Husband, Rednap Howell, and others, armed with clubs, whips, and cudgels,
surged into the court-room and through their spokesman, Jeremiah Fields, presented a statement
of their grievances. "I found myself," says Judge Henderson, "under a necessity of attempting
to soften and turn away the fury of these mad people, in the best manner in my power, and as
such could well be, pacify their rage and at the same time preserve the little remaining dignity
of the court."

During an interim, in which the Regulators retired for consultation, they fell without warning
upon Fanning and gave him such rough treatment that he narrowly escaped with his life. The
mob, now past control, horsewhipped a number of leading lawyers and citizens gathered there
at court, and treated others, notably the courtly Mr. Hooper of Boston, "with every mark of
contempt and insult." Judge Henderson was assured by Fields that no harm should come to him
provided he would conduct the court in accordance with the behest of the Regulators: namely,
that no lawyer, save the King's Attorney, should be admitted to the court, and that the Regulators'
cases should be tried with new jurors chosen by the Regulators. With the entire little village
terrorized by this campaign of "frightfulness," and the court wholly unprotected, Judge Henderson
reluctantly acknowledged to himself that "the power of the judiciary was exhausted." Nevertheless,
he says, "I made every effort in my power consistent with my office and the duty the public
is entitled to claim to preserve peace and good order." Agreeing under duress to resume the
session the following day, the judge ordered an adjournment. But being unwilling, on mature
reflection, to permit a mockery of the court and a travesty of justice to be staged under threat
and intimidation, he returned that night to his home in Granville and left the court adjourned
in course. Enraged by the judge's escape, the Regulators took possession of the court room
the following morning, called over the cases, and in futile protest against the conditions
they were powerless to remedy, made profane entries which may still be seen on the record:
"Damned rogues," "Fanning pays cost but loses nothing," "Negroes not worth a damn, Cost exceeds
the whole," "Hogan pays and be damned," and, in a case of slander, "Nonsense, let them argue
for Ferrell has gone hellward."

The uprising of these bold and resolute, simple and imperfectly educated people, which had
begun as a constitutional struggle to secure justice and to prevent their own exploitation
by dishonest lawyers of the county courts, now gave place to open anarchy and secret incendiarism.
In the dead of night, November 12th and 14th, Judge Henderson's barn, stables, and dwelling
house were fired by the Regulators and went up in flames. Glowing with a sense of wrong, these
misguided people, led on by fanatical agitators, thus vented their indiscriminate rage, not
only upon their op pressors, but also upon men wholly innocent of injuring them--men of the
stamp of William Hooper, afterward signer of the Declaration of Independence, Alexander Martin,
afterward governor and United States Senator, and Richard Henderson, popular representative
of the back country and a firm champion of due process of law. It is perhaps not surprising
in view of these events that Governor Tryon and the ruling class, lacking a sympathy broad
enough to ensure justice to the oppressed people, seemed to be chiefly impressed with the fact
that a widespread insurrection was in progress, threatening not only life and property, but
also civil government itself. The governor called out the militia of the province and led an
army of well nigh one thousand men and officers against the Regulators, who had assembled at
Alamance to the number of two thousand. Tryon stood firm upon the demands that the people should
submit to government and disperse at a designated hour. The Regulators, on their side, hoped
to secure the reforms they desired by intimidating the governor with a great display of force.
The battle was a tragic fiasco for the Regulators, who fought bravely, but without adequate
arms or real leadership. With the conclusion of this desultory action, a fight lasting about
two hours (May 16, 1771), the power of the Regulators was completely broken."

Among these insurgents there was a remarkable element, an element whose influence upon the
course of American history has been but imperfectly understood which now looms into prominence
as the vanguard of the army of westward expansion. There were some of the Regulators who, though
law-abiding and conservative, were deeply imbued with ideas of liberty, personal independence,
and the freedom of the soil. We had have in influence, after we should have been incapacitated from

 Moreover, Dunmore
was interested in great land speculations on his own account; and while overtly vindicating
Virginia's claim to the trans-Alleghany by despatching parties of surveyors to the western
wilderness to locate and survey lands covered by military grants, he with the collusion of
certain members of the "Honourable Board," his council, as charged by Washington, was more
than "lukewarm," secretly restricting as rigorously as he dared the extent and number of the
soldiers' allotments. According to the famous Virginia Remonstrance, he was in league with
"men of great influence in some of the neighboring states" to secure, under cover of purchases
from the Indians, large tracts of country between the Ohio and the Mississippi." In shaping
his plans Dunmore had the shrewd legal counsel of Patrick Henry, who was equally intent upon
making for himself a private purchase from the Cherokees. It was Henry's legal opinion that
the Indiana purchase from the Six Nations by the Pennsylvania traders at Fort Stanwix (November
5, 1768) was valid; and that purchase by private individuals from the Indians gave full and
ample title. In consequence of these facts, William Murray, in behalf of himself and his associates
of the Illinois Land Company, and on the strength of the Camden Yorke decision, purchased two
large tracts, on the Illinois and Ohio respectively, from the Illinois Indians (July 5, 1773);
and in order to win the support of Dunmore, who was ambitious to make a fortune in land speculation,
organized a second company, the Wabash (Ouabache) Land Company, with the governor as the chief
share-holder. In response to Murray's petition on behalf of the Illinois Land Company, Dunmore
(May, 1774) recommended it to Lord Dartmouth, Secretary of State for the Colonies, and urged
that it be granted; and in a later letter he disingenuously disclaimed any personal interest
in the Illinois speculation.

The party of surveyors sent out under the direction of Colonel William Preston, on the request
of Washington and other leading eastern men, in 1774 located lands covered by military grants
on the Ohio and in the Kentucky area for prominent Virginians, including Washington, Patrick
Henry, William Byrd, William Preston, Arthur Campbell, William Fleming, and Andrew Lewis, among
others, and also a large tract for Dr. Connolly. Certain of these grants fell within the Vandalia
area; and in his reply (September 10, 1774) to Dunmore's letter, Lord Dartmouth sternly censured
Dunmore for allowing these grants, and accused the white settlers of having brought on, by
such unwarrantable aggressions, the war then raging with the Indians. This charge lay at the
door of Dunmore himself; and there is strong evidence that Dunmore personally fomented the
war, ostensibly in support of Virginia's charter rights, but actually in order to further his
own speculative designs." Dunmore's agent, Dr. Connolly, heading a party posing as Virginia
militia, fired without provocation upon a delegation of Shawanoe chiefs assembled at Fort Pitt
(January, 1774). Taking advantage of the alarming situation created by the conflict of the
claims of Virginia and Pennsylvania, Connolly, inspired by Dunmore without doubt, then issued
an incendiary circular (April 21, 1774), declaring a state of war to exist. Just two weeks
before the Battle of the Great Kanawha, Patrick Henry categorically stated, in conversation
with Thomas Wharton:

"that he was at Williamsburg with Ld. D. when Dr. Conolly first came there, that Conolly is
a chatty, sensible man, and informed Ld. Dunmore of the extreme richness of the lands which
lay on both sides of the Ohio; that the prohibitory orders which had been sent him relative
to the land on the hither side (or Vandalia) had caused him to turn his thoughts to the opposite
shore, and that as his Lordship was determined to settle his family in America he was really
pursueing this war, in order to obtain by purchase or treaty from the natives a tract of territory
on that side; he then told me that he was convinced from every authority that the law knew,
that a purchase from the natives was as full and ample a title as could be obtained, that they
had Lord Camden and Mr. York's opinion on that head, which opinion with some others that Ld.
Dunmore had consulted, and with the knowledge Conolly had given him of the quality of the country
and his determined resolution to settle his family on this continent, were the real motives
or springs of the present expedition."

At this very time, Patrick Henry, in conjunction with William Byrd 3d and others, was negotiating
for a private purchase of lands from the Cherokees; and when Wharton, after answering Henry's
inquiry as to where he might buy Indian goods, remarked: "It's not possible you mean to enter
the Indian trade at this period," Henry laughingly replied: "The wish-world is my hobby horse."
"From whence I conclude," adds Wharton, "he has some prospect of making a purchase of the natives,
but where I know not."

The war, thus promulgated, we believe, at Dunmore's secret instigation and heralded by a series
of ghastly atrocities, came on apace. After the inhuman murder of the family of Logan, the
Indian chieftain, by one Greathouse and his drunken companions (April 30th), Logan, who contrary
to romantic views was a blackhearted and vengeful savage, harried the Tennessee and Virginia
borders, burning and slaughtering. Unable to arouse the Cherokees, owing to the opposition
of Atta-kulla-kulla, Logan as late as July 21st said in a letter to the whites: "The Indians
are not angry, only myself," and not until then did Dunmore begin to give full execution to
his warlike plans. The best woodsmen of the border, Daniel Boone and the German scout Michael
Stoner, having been despatched on July 27th by Colonel William Preston to warn the surveyors
of the trans-Alleghany, made a remarkable journey on foot of eight hundred miles in sixty-one
days. Harrod's company at Harrodsburg, a company of surveyors at Fontainebleau, Floyd's party
on the Kentucky, and the surveyors at Mann's Lick, this warned, hurried in to the settlements
and were saved. Meanwhile, Dunmore, in command of the Virginia forces, invaded territory guaranteed
to the Indians by the royal proclamation of 1763 and recently (1774) added to the province
of Quebec, a fact of which he was not aware, conducted a vigorous campaign, and fortified Camp
Charlotte, near Old Chillicothe. Andrew Lewis, however, in charge of the other division of
Dunmore's army, was the one destined to bear the real brunt and burden of the campaign. His
division, recruited from the very flower of the pioneers of the Old Southwest, was the most
representative body of borderers of this region that up to this time had assembled to measure
strength with the red men. It was an army of the true stalwarts of the frontier, with fringed
leggings and hunting-capes, rifles and powder-horns, hunting-knives and tomahawks.

The Battle of the Great Kanawha, at Point Pleasant, was fought on October 10, 1774, between
Lewis's force, eleven hundred strong, and the Indians, under Cornstalk, somewhat inferior in
numbers. It was a desultory action, over a greatly extended front and in very brushy country
between Crooked Creek and the Ohio. Throughout the long day, the Indians fought with rare craft
and stubborn bravery--loudly cursing the white men, cleverly picking off their leaders, and
derisively inquiring, in regard to the absence of the fifes: "Where are your whistles now?"
Slowly retreating, they sought to draw the whites into an ambuscade and at a favorable moment
to "drive the Long Knives like bullocks into the river." No marked success was achieved on
either side until near sunset, when a flank movement directed by young Isaac Shelby alarmed
the Indians, who mistook this party for the expected reinforcement under Christian, and retired
across the Ohio. In the morning the whites were amazed to discover that the Indians, who the
preceding day so splendidly heeded the echoing call of Cornstalk, "Be strong! Be strong!",
had quit the battlefield and left the victory with the whites.

The peace negotiated by Dunmore was durable. The governor had accomplished his purpose, defied
the authority of the crown, and vindicated the claim of Virginia, to the enthusiastic satisfaction
of the backwoodsmen. Dunmore's War is epochal, in that it procured for the nonce a state of
peace with the Indians, which made possible the advance of Judge Henderson over the Transylvania
Trail in 1775, and, through his establishment of the Transylvania Fort at Boonesborough, the
ultimate acquisition by the American Confederation of the imperial domain of the trans-Alleghany.

CHAPTER XIV. Richard Henderson and the Transylvania Company

I happened to fall in company, and have a great deal of conversation with one of the most singular
and extraordinary persons and excentric geniuses in America, and perhaps in the world. His
name is Richard Henderson.--J. F. D. Smyth: A Tour in the United States of America.

Early in 1774, chastened by his own disastrous failure the preceding autumn, Boone advised
Judge Henderson that the time was auspicious for opening negotiations with the Cherokees for
purchasing the trans-Alleghany region." In organizing a company for this purpose, Henderson
chose men of action and resource, leaders in the colony, ready for any hazard of life and fortune
in this gigantic scheme of colonization and promotion. The new men included, in addition to
the partners in the organization known as Richard Henderson and Company, were Colonel John
Luttrell, destined to win laurels in the Revolution, and William Johnston, a native of Scotland,
the leading merchant of Hillsborough.

Meeting in Hillsborough on August 27, 1774, these men organized the new company under the name
of the Louisa Company. In the articles then drawn up they agreed to "rent or purchase" a tract
of land from the Indian owners of the soil for the express purpose of "settling the country."
Each partner obligated himself to "furnish his Quota of Expenses necessary towards procuring
the grant." In full anticipation of the grave dangers to be encountered, they solemnly bound
themselves, as "equal sharers in the property," to "support each other with our lives and fortunes."
Negotiations with the Indians were begun at once. Accompanied by Colonel Nathaniel Hart and
guided by the experienced Indian-trader, Thomas Price, Judge Henderson visited the Cherokee
chieftains at the Otari towns. After elaborate consultations, the latter deputed the old chieftain,
Atta-kulla-kulla, a young buck, and a squaw, "to attend the said Henderson and Hart to North
Carolina, and there examine the Goods and Merchandize which had been by them offered as the
Consideration of the purchase." The goods purchased at Cross Creek (now Fayetteville, North
Carolina), in which the Louisa Company "had embarked a large amount," met the entire approval
of the Indians--the squaw in particular shrewdly examining the goods in the interest of the
women of the tribe.

On January 6, 1775, the company was again enlarged, and given the name of the Transylvania
Company-the three new partners being David Hart, brother to Thomas and Nathaniel, Leonard Henley
Bullock, a prominent citizen of Granville, and James Hogg, of Hillsborough, a native Scotchman
and one of the most influential men in the colony. In the elaborate agreement drawn up reference
is explicitly made to the contingency of "settling and voting as a proprietor and giving Rules
and Regulations for the Inhabitants etc." Hillsborough was the actual starting-point for the
westward movement, the first emigrants, traveling thence to the Sycamore Shoals of the Watauga.
In speaking of the departure of the settlers, the first movement of extended and permanent
westward migration, an eye-witness quaintly says: "At this place [Hillsborough] I saw the first
party of emigrant families that moved to Kentucky under the auspices of Judge Henderson. They
marched out of the town with considerable solemnity, and to many their destination seemed as
remote as if it had been to the South Sea Islands." Meanwhile, the "Proposals for the encouragement
of settling the lands etc.," issued on Christmas Day, 1774, were quickly spread broadcast through
the colony and along the border." It was the greatest sensation North Carolina had known since
Alamance; and Archibald Neilson, deputy-auditor and naval officer of the colony, inquired with
quizzical anxiety: "Pray, is Dick Henderson out of his head?" The most liberal terms, proffered
by one quite in possession of his head, were embodied in these proposals. Land at twenty shillings
per hundred acres was offered to each emigrant settling within the territory and raising a
crop of corn before September 1, 1775, the emigrant being permitted to take up as much as five
hundred acres for him self and two hundred and fifty acres for each tithable person under him.
In these "Proposals" there was no indication that the low terms at which the lands were offered
would be maintained after September 1, 1775. In a letter to Governor Dunmore (January, 1775),
Colonel William Preston, county surveyor of Fincastle County, Virginia, says "The low price
he [Henderson] proposes to sell at, together with some further encouragement he offers, will
I am apprehensive induce a great many families to remove from this County (Fincastle) & Carolina
and settle there." Joseph Martin, states his son, "was appointed entry-Taker and agent for
the Powell Valley portion" of the Transylvania Purchase on January 20, 1775; and "he (Joseph
Martin) and others went on in the early part of the year 1775 and made their stand at the very
spot where he had made corn several years before. In speaking of the startling design, unmasked
by Henderson, of establishing an independent government, Colonel Preston writes to George Washington
of the contemplated "large Purchase by one Col. Henderson of North Carolina from the Cherokees....
I hear that Henderson talks with great Freedom & Indecency of the Governor of Virginia, sets
the Government at Defiance & says if he once had five hundred good Fellows settled in that
Country he would not Value Virginia."

Early in 1775 runners were sent off to the Cherokee towns to summon the Indians to the treaty
ground at the Sycamore Shoals of the Watauga; and Boone, after his return from a hunt in Kentucky
in January, was summoned by Judge Henderson to aid in the negotiations preliminary to the actual
treaty. The dominating figure in the remarkable assemblage at the treaty ground, consisting
of twelve hundred Indians and several hundred whites, was Richard Henderson, "comely in person,
of a benign and social disposition," with countenance betokening the man of strenuous action"
noble forehead, prominent nose, projecting chin, firm-set jaw, with kindness and openness of
expression." Gathered about him, picturesque in garb and striking in appearance, were many
of the buckskin-clad leaders of the border--James Robertson, John Sevier, Isaac Shelby, William
Bailey Smith, and their compeers--as well as his Carolina friends John Williams, Thomas and
Nathaniel Hart, Nathaniel Henderson, Jesse Benton, and Valentine Searcy.

Little was accomplished on the first day of the treaty (March 14th); but on the next day, the
Cherokees offered to sell the section bargained for by Donelson acting as agent for Virginia
in 1771. Although the Indians pointed out that Virginia had never paid the promised compensation
of five hundred pounds and had therefore forfeited her rights, Henderson flatly refused to
entertain the idea of purchasing territory to which Virginia had the prior claim. Angered by
Henderson's refusal, The Dragging Canoe, leaping into the circle of the seated savages, made
an impassioned speech touched with the romantic imagination peculiar to the American Indian.
With pathetic eloquence he dwelt upon the insatiable land-greed of the white men, and predicted
the extinction of his race if they committed the insensate folly of selling their beloved hunting-grounds.
Roused to a high pitch of oratorical fervor, the savage with uplifted arm fiercely exhorted
his people to resist further encroachments at all hazards--and left the treaty ground. This
incident brought the conference to a startling and abrupt conclusion. On the following day,
however, the savages proved more tractable, agreeing to sell the land as far as the Cumberland
River. In order to secure the additional territory watered by the tributaries of the Cumberland,
Henderson agreed to pay an additional sum of two thousand pounds. Upon this day there originated
the ominous phrase descriptive of Kentucky when The Dragging Canoe, dramatically pointing toward
the west, declared that a DARK Cloud hung over that land, which was known as the BLOODY GROUND.

On the last day, March 17th, the negotiations were opened with the signing of the "Great Grant."
The area purchased, some twenty millions of acres, included almost all the present state of
Kentucky, and an immense tract in Tennessee, comprising all the territory watered by the Cumberland
River and all its tributaries. For "two thousand weight of leather in goods" Henderson purchased
"the lands lying down Holston and between the Watauga lease, Colonel Donelson's line and Powell's
Mountain" as a pathway to Kentucky--the deed for which was known as the "Path Deed." By special
arrangement, Carter's Valley in this tract went to Carter and Lucas; two days later, for two
thousand pounds, Charles Robertson on behalf of the Watauga Association purchased a large tract
in the valleys of the Holston, Watauga, and New Rivers; and eight days later Jacob Brown purchased
two large areas, including the Nolichucky Valley. This historic treaty, which heralds the opening
of the West, was conducted with absolute justice and fairness by Judge Henderson and his associates.
No liquor was permitted at the treaty ground; and Thomas Price, the ablest of the Cherokee
traders, deposed that "he at that time understood the Cherokee language, so as to comprehend
everything which was said and to know that what was observed on either side was fairly and
truly translated; that the Cherokees perfectly understood, what Lands were the subject of the
Treaty...." The amount paid by the Transylvania Company for the imperial domain was ten thousand
pounds sterling, in money and in goods.

Although Daniel Boone doubtless assisted in the proceedings prior to the negotiation of the
treaty, his name nowhere appears in the voluminous records of the conference. Indeed, he was
not then present; for a fortnight before the conclusion of the treaty he was commissioned by
Judge Henderson to form a party of competent woodmen to blaze a passage through the wilderness.
On March 10th this party of thirty ax-men, under the leadership of Boone, started from the
rendezvous, the Long Island of Holston, to engage in the arduous labor of cutting out the Transylvania
Trail.

Henderson, the empire-builder, now faced with courage and resolution the hazardous task of
occupying the purchased territory and establishing an independent government. No mere financial
promoter of a vast speculative enterprise, he was one of the heroic figures of the Old Southwest;
and it was his dauntless courage, his unwavering resolve to go forward in the face of all dangers,
which carried through the armed "trek" to a successful conclusion. At Martin's Station, where
Henderson and his party tarried to build a house in which to store their wagons, as the road
could be cleared no further, they were joined by another party, of five adventurers from Prince
William County, Virginia." In Henderson's party were some forty men and boys, with forty packhorses
and a small amount of powder, lead, salt, and garden-seeds. The warning freely given by Joseph
Martin of the perils of the path was soon confirmed, as appears from the following entry in
Henderson's diary:

"Friday the 7th. [April] About Brake of Day began to snow. About 11 O'Clock received a letter
from Mr. Luttrells camp that were five persons killd on the road to the Cantuckie by Indians.
Capt. [Nathaniel] Hart, uppon the receipt of this News Retreated back with his Company, & determined
to Settle in the Valley to make Corn for the Cantucky people. The same Day Received a Letter
from Dan. Boone, that his Company was fired uppon by Indians, Kill'd Two of his men--tho he
kept the ground & saved the Baggage &c."

The following historic letter, which reveals alike the dogged resolution of Boone and his reliance
upon Henderson and his company in this black hour of disaster, addressed "Colonel Richard Henderson--these
with care," is eloquent in its simplicity

"Dear Colonel: After my compliments to you, I shall acquaint you of our misfortunes.

This dread intelligence caused the hearts of strong men to quail and induced some to turn back,
but Henderson, the jurist-pioneer, was made of sterner stuff. At once (April 8th) he despatched
an urgent letter in hot haste to the proprietors of Transylvania, enclosing Boone's letter,
informing them of Boone's plight and urging them to send him immediately a large quantity of
powder and lead, as he had been compelled to abandon his supply of saltpeter at Martin's Station.
"We are all in high spirits," he assures the proprietors, "and on thorns to fly to Boone's
assistance, and join him in defense of so fine and valuable a country."

Laconically eloquent is this simple entry in his diary: "Saturday the 8th. Started abt. 10
oClock Crossed Cumberland Gap about 4 miles met about 40 persons Returning from the Cantucky,
on Acct. of the Late Murders by the Indians could prevail on one only to return. Memo Several
Virginians who were with us return'd."

There is no more crucial moment in early Western history than this, in which we see the towering
form of Henderson, clad in the picturesque garb of the pioneer, with outstretched arm resolutely
pointing forward to the "dark and bloody ground," and in impassioned but futile eloquence pleading
with the pale and panic-stricken fugitives to turn about, to join his company, and to face
once more the mortal dangers of pioneer conquest. Significant indeed are the lines:

  Some to endure, and many to fail,
  Some to conquer, and many to quail,
  Toiling over the Wilderness Trail.

The spirit of the pioneer knight-errant inspires Henderson's words: "In this situation, some
few, of genuine courage and undaunted resolution, served to inspire the rest; by the help of
whose example, assisted by a little pride and some ostentation, we made a shift to march on
with all the appearance of gallantry, and, cavalier like, treated every insinuation of danger
with the utmost contempt."

Fearing that Boone, who did not even know that Henderson's cavalcade was on the road, would
be unable to hold out, Henderson realized the imperative necessity for sending him a message
of encouragement. The bold young Virginian, William Cocke, volunteered to brave alone the dangers
of the murder-haunted trail to undertake a ride more truly memorable and hazardous than that
of Revere. "This offer, extraordinary as it was, we could by no means refuse," remarks Henderson,
who shed tears of gratitude as he proffered his sincere thanks and wrung the brave messenger's
hand. Equipped with "a good Queen Anne's musket, plenty of ammunition, a tomahawk, a large
cuttoe knife [French, couteau], a Dutch blanket, and no small quantity of jerked beef," Cocke
on April 10th rode off "to the Cantuckey to Inform Capt Boone that we were on the road." The
fearful apprehensions felt for Cocke's safety were later relieved, when along the road were
discovered his letters in forming Henderson of his arrival and of his having been joined on
the way by Page Portwood of Rowan. On his arrival at Otter Creek, Cocke found Boone and his
men, and on relating his adventures, "came in for his share of applause." Boone at once despatched
the master woodman, Michael Stoner, with pack-horses to assist Henderson's party, which he
met on April 18th at their encampment "in the Eye of the Rich Land." Along with "Excellent
Beef in plenty," Stoner brought the story of Boone's determined stand and an account of the
erection of a rude little fortification which they had hurriedly thrown up to resist attack.
With laconic significance Henderson pays the following tribute to Boone which deserves to be
perpetuated in national annals: "It was owing to Boone's confidence in us, and the people's
in him, that a stand was ever attempted in order to wait for our coming."

In the course of their journey over the mountains and through the wilderness, the pioneers
forgot the trials of the trail in the face of the surpassing beauties of the country. The Cumberlands
were covered with rich undergrowth of the red and white rhododendron, the delicate laurel,
the mountain ivy, the flameazalea, the spicewood, and the cane; while the white stars of the
dogwood and the carmine blossoms of the red-bud, strewn across the verdant background of the
forest, gleamed in the eager air of spring. "To enter uppon a detail of the Beuty & Goodness
of our Country," writes Nathaniel Henderson, "would be a task too arduous.... Let it suffice
to tell you it far exceeds any country I ever saw or herd off. I am conscious its out of the
power of any man to make you clearly sensible of the great Beuty and Richness of Kentucky."
Young Felix Walker, endowed with more vivid powers of description, says with a touch of native
eloquence:

"Perhaps no Adventurer Since the days of donquicksotte or before ever felt So Cheerful & Ilated
in prospect, every heart abounded with Joy & excitement ... & exclusive of the Novelties of
the Journey the advantages & accumalations arising on the Settlement of a new Country was a
dazzling object with many of our Company.... As the Cain ceased, we began to discover the pleasing
& Rapturous appearance of the plains of Kentucky, a New Sky & Strange Earth to be presented
to our view.... So Rich a Soil we had never Saw before, Covered with Clover in full Bloom.
the Woods alive abounding in wild Game, turkeys so numerous that it might be said there appeared
but one flock Universally Scattered in the woods ... it appeared that Nature in the profusion
of her Bounties, had Spread a feast for all that lives, both for the Animal & Rational World,
a Sight so delightful to our View and grateful to our feelings almost Induced us, in Immitation
of Columbus in Transport to Kiss the Soil of Kentucky, as he haild & Saluted the sand on his
first setting his foot on the Shores of America."

On the journey Henderson was joined in Powell's Valley by Benjamin Logan, afterward so famous
in Kentucky annals, and a companion, William Galaspy. At the Crab Orchard they left Henderson's
party; and turning their course westward finally pitched camp in the present Lincoln County,
where Logan subsequently built a fort. On Sunday, April 16th, on Scaggs's Creek, Henderson
records: "About 12 oClock Met James McAfee with 18 other persons Returning from Cantucky."
They advised Henderson of the "troublesomeness and danger" of the Indians, says Robert McAfee
junior: "but Henderson assured them that he had purchased the whole country from the Indians,
that it belonged to him, and he had named it Transylvania.... Robt, Samuel, and William McAfee
and 3 others were inclined to return, but James opposed it, alleging that Henderson had no
right to the land, and that Virginia had previously bought it. The former (6) returned with
Henderson to Boonesborough." Among those who had joined Henderson's party was Abraham Hanks
from Virginia, the maternal grandfather of Abraham Lincoln; but alarmed by the stories brought
by Stewart and his party of fugitives, Hanks and Drake, as recorded by William Calk on that
day (April 13th), turned back.

At last the founder of Kentucky with his little band reached the destined goal of their arduous
journeyings. Henderson's record on his birthday runs: "Thursday the 20th [April] Arrived at
Fort Boone on the Mouth of Oter Creek Cantuckey River where we were Saluted by a running fire
of about 25 Guns; all that was then at Fort.... The men appeared in high spirits & much rejoiced
in our arrival." It is a coincidence of historic interest that just one day after the embattled
farmers at Lexington and Concord "fired the shots heard round the world," the echoing shots
of Boone and his sturdy backwoodsmen rang out to announce the arrival of the proprietor of
Transylvania and the birth of the American West.

CHAPTER XV. Transylvania--A wilderness Commonwealth

You are about a work of the utmost importance to the well-being of this country in general,
in which the interest and security of each and every individual are inseparably connected ....
Our peculiar circumstances in this remote country, surrounded on all sides with difficulties,
and equally subject to one common danger, which threatens our common overthrow, must, I think,
in their effects, secure to us an union of interests, and, consequently, that harmony in opinion,
so essential to the forming good, wise and wholesome laws.--Judge Richard Henderson: Address
to the Legislature of Transylvania, May 23, 1775.

The independent spirit displayed by the Transylvania Company, and Henderson's procedure in
open defiance of the royal governors of both North Carolina and Virginia, naturally aroused
grave alarm throughout these colonies and South Carolina. "This in my Opinion," says Preston
in a letter to George Washington (January 31, 1775), "will soon become a serious Affair, &
highly deserves the Attention of the Government. For it is certain that a vast Number of People
are preparing to go out and settle on this Purchase; and if once they get fixed there, it will
be next to impossible to remove them or reduce them to Obedience; as they are so far from the
Seat of Government. Indeed it may be the Cherokees will support them." Governor Martin of North
Carolina, already deeply disturbed in anticipation of the coming revolutionary cataclysm, thundered
in what was generally regarded as a forcible-feeble proclamation (February 19, 1775) against
"Richard Henderson and his Confederates" in their "daring, unjust and unwarrantable proceedings."
In a letter to Dartmouth he denounces "Henderson the famous invader" and dubs the Transylvania
Company "an infamous Company of land Pyrates."

Officials who were themselves eager for land naturally opposed Henderson's plans. Lord Dunmore,
who in 1774, as we have seen, was heavily interested in the Wabash Land Company engineered
by William Murray, took the ground that the Wabash purchase was valid under the Camden-Yorke
decision. This is so stated in the records of the Illinois Company. Likewise under Murray's
control. But although the "Ouabache Company," of which Dunmore was a leading member, was initiated
as early as May 16, 1774, the purchase of the territory was not formally effected until October
18, 1775--too late to benefit Dunmore, then deeply embroiled in the preliminaries to the Revolution.
Under the cover of his agent's name, it is believed, Dunmore, with his "passion for land and
fees," illegally entered tracts aggregating thousands of acres of land surveyed by the royal
surveyors in the summer of 1774 for Dr. John Connolly. (severe and old).

settlement he had made the preceding year, having arrived there before the McAfees started
back to Virginia; and there were small groups of settlers at Boiling Spring, six miles southeast
of Harrods settlement, and at St. Asaph's, a mile west of the present Stanford. A representative
government for Transylvania was then planned. When the frank and gallant Floyd arrived at the
Transylvania Fort on May 3d, he "expressed great satisfaction," says Judge Henderson, "on being
informed of the plan we proposed for Legislation & sayd he must most heartily concur in that
& every other measure we should adopt for the well Govern'g or good of the Community in Gen'l."
In reference to a conversation with Captain James Harrod and Colonel Thomas Slaughter of Virginia,
Henderson notes in his diary (May 8th): "Our plan of Legislation, the evils pointed out--the
remedies to be applyed &c &c &c were Acceeded to without Hesitation. The plann was plain &
Simple--'twas nothing novel in its essence a thousand years ago it was in use, and found by
every year's experience since to be unexceptionable. We were in four distinct settlem'ts. Members
or delegates from every place by free choice of Individuals they first having entered into
writings solemnly binding themselves to obey and carry into Execution Such Laws as representatives
should from time to time make, Concurred with, by A Majority of the Proprietors present in
the Country."

In reply to inquiries of the settlers, Judge Henderson gave as his reason for this assembling
of a Transylvania Legislature that "all power was derived from the people." Six days before
the prophetic arrival of the news of the Battle of Lexington and eight days before the revolutionary
committee of Mecklenburg County, North Carolina, promulgated their memorable Resolves establishing
laws for independent government, the pioneers assembled on the green beneath the mighty plane-tree
at the Transylvania Fort.

An early writer, in speaking of the full blooded democracy of these "advanced" sentiments,
quaintly comments: "If Jeremy Bentham had been in existence of manhood, he would have sent
his compliments to the President of Transylvania." This, the first representative body of American
freemen which ever convened west of the Alleghanies, is surely the most unique colonial government
ever set up on this continent. The proceedings of this backwoods legislature--the democratic
leader ship of the principal proprietor; the prudence exhibited in the laws for protecting
game, breeding horses, etc.; the tolerance shown in the granting of full religious liberty--all
display the acumen and practical wisdom of these pioneer law-givers. As the result of Henderson's
tactfulness, the proprietary form of government, thoroughly democratized in tone, was complacently
accepted by the backwoods men. From one who, though still under royal rule, vehemently asserted
that the source of all political power was the people, and that "laws derive force and efficiency
from our mutual consent," Western democracy thus born in the wilderness was "taking its first
political lesson." In their answer to Henderson's assertion of freedom from alien authority
the pioneers unhesitatingly declared: "That we have an absolute right, as a political body,
without giving umbrage to Great Britain, or any of the colonies, to form rules for the government
of our little society, cannot be doubted by any sensible mind and being without the jurisdiction
of, and not answerable to any of his Majesty's courts, the constituting tribunals of justice
shall be a matter of our first contemplation...." In the establishment of a constitution for
the new colony, Henderson with paternalistic wisdom induced the people to adopt a legal code
based on the laws of England. Out of a sense of self-protection he reserved for the proprietors
only one prerogative not granted them by the people, the right of veto. He clearly realized
that if this power were given up, the delegates to any convention that might be held after
the first would be able to assume the claims and rights of the proprietors.

A land-office was formally opened, deeds were issued, and a store was established which supplied
the colonists with powder, lead, salt, osnaburgs, blankets, and other chief necessities of
pioneer existence. Writing to his brother Jonathan from Leestown, the bold young George Rogers
Clark, soon to plot the downfall of Transylvania, enthusiastically says (July 6, 1775): "A
richer and more Beautifull Cuntry than this I believe has never been seen in America yet. Col.
Henderson is hear and Claims all ye Country below Kentucke. If his Claim Should be good, land
may be got Reasonable Enough and as good as any in ye World." Those who settled on the south
side of Kentucky River acknowledged the validity of the Transylvania purchase; and Clark in
his Memoir says: "the Proprietors at first took great pains to Ingratiate themselves in the
fav'r of the people."

In regard to the designs of Lord Dunmore, who, as noted above, had illegally entered the Connolly
grant on the Ohio and sought to outlaw Henderson, and of Colonel William Byrd 3d, who, after
being balked in Patrick Henry's plan to anticipate the Transylvania Company in effecting a
purchase from the Cherokees, was supposed to have tried to persuade the Cherokees to repudiate
the "Great Treaty," Henderson defiantly says: "Whether Lord Dunmore and Colonel Byrd have interfered
with the Indians or not, Richard Henderson is equally ignorant and indifferent. The utmost
result of their efforts can only serve to convince them of the futility of their schemes and
possibly frighten some few faint-hearted persons, naturally prone to reverence great names
and fancy everything must shrink at the magic of a splendid title."

Prompted by Henderson's desire to petition the Continental Congress then in session for recognition
as the fourteenth colony, the Transylvania legislature met again on the first Thursday in September
and elected Richard Henderson and John Williams, among others, as delegates to the gathering
at Philadelphia. Shortly afterward the Proprietors of Transylvania held a meeting at Oxford,
North Carolina (September 25, 1775), elected Williams as the agent of the colony, and directed
him to proceed to Boonesborough there to reside until April, 1776. James Hogg, of Hillsborough,
chosen as Delegate to represent the Colony in the Continental Congress, was despatched to Philadelphia,
bearing with him an elaborate memorial prepared by the President, Judge Henderson, petitioning
the Congress "to take the infant Colony of Transylvania into their protection."

Almost immediately upon his arrival in Philadelphia, James Hogg was presented to "the famous
Samuel and John Adams." The latter warned Hogg, in view of the efforts then making toward reconciliation
between the colonies and the king, that "the taking under our protection a body of people who
have acted in defiance of the King's proclamation, will be looked on as a confirmation of that
independent spirit with which we are daily reproached." Jefferson said that if his advice were
followed, all the use the Virginians should make of their charter would be "to prevent any
arbitrary or oppressive government to be established within the boundaries of it"; and that
it was his wish "to see a free government established at the back of theirs [Virginia's] properly
united with them." He would not consent, however, that Congress should acknowledge the colony
of Transylvania, until it had the approbation of the Virginia Convention. The quit-rents imposed
by the company were denounced in Congress as a mark of vassalage; and many advised a law against
the employment of negroes in the colony. "They even threatened us with their opposition," says
Hogg, with precise veracity, "if we do not act upon liberal principles when we have it so much
in our power to render ourselves immortal."

CHAPTER XVI. The Repulse of the Red Men

To this short war may be properly attributed all the kind feelings and fidelity to treaty stipulations
manifested by the Cherokees ever afterwards. General Rutherford instilled into the Indians
so great a fear of the whites, that never afterwards were they disposed to engage in any cruelty,
or destroy any of the property of our frontier men.--David L. Swain: The Indian War of 1776.

During the summer of 1775 the proprietors of Transylvania were confronted with two stupendous
tasks--that of winning the favor and support of the frontiersmen and that of rallying the rapidly
dwindling forces in Kentucky in defense of the settlements. DOORS Unfold AT 6.---- Governor has produced

is one of several Professor Snaer's pieces that show him did to be
a abstractor of fine abilities.] From the notes of a critic of New Orleans
I learn that this concert was in all respects a fine success.

 The gloom which had been occasioned by the almost complete desertion of the stations
at Harrodsburg, the Boiling Spring, and the Transylvania Fort or Boonesborough was dispelled
with the return of Boone, accompanied by some thirty persons, on September 8th, and of Richard
Callaway with a considerable party on September 26th. The crisis was now passed; and the colony
began for the first time really to flourish. The people on the south side of the Kentucky River
universally accepted proprietary rule for the time being. But the seeds of dissension were
soon to be sown among those who settled north of the river, as well as among men of the stamp
of James Harrod, who, having preceded Henderson in the establishment of a settlement in Kentucky,
naturally resented holding lands under the Transylvania Company.

The great liberality of this organization toward incoming settlers had resulted in immense
quantities of land being taken up through their land-office. The ranging, hunting, and road-building
were paid for by the company; and the entire settlement was furnished with powder, lead, and
supplies, wholly on credit, for this and the succeeding year. "Five hundred and sixty thousand
acres of land are now entered," reports Floyd on December 1st, "and most of the people waiting
to have it run out." After Dunmore, having lost his hold upon the situation, escaped to the
protection of a British vessel, the Fowey, Colonel Preston continued to prevent surveys for
officers' grants within the Transylvania territory; and his original hostility to Judge Henderson
gave place to friendship and support. On December 1st, Colonel John Williams, resident agent
of the Transylvania Company, announced at Boonesborough the long-contemplated and widely advertised
advance in price of the lands, from twenty to fifty shillings per hundred acres, with surveying
fees of four dollars for tracts not exceeding six hundred and forty acres. At a meeting of
the Transylvania legislature, convened on December 21st, John Floyd was chosen surveyor general
of the colony, Nathaniel Henderson was placed in charge of the Entering Office, and Richard
Harrison given the post of secretary. Those who are familiar with the draught of this mass say that the
difficult one is its exact counterpart. He has equally be rewritten from memory, for which a gentleman

published by Louis Grunewald, new Orleans.
Despite these efforts at accommodation, grave doubts were implanted by this Harrodsburg Remonstrance
in the minds of the people; and much discussion and discontent ensued.

By midsummer, 1775, George Rogers Clark, a remarkably enterprising and independent young pioneer,
was "engrossing all the land he could" in Kentucky. Upon his return to Virginia, as he relates,
he "found there was various oppinions Respecting Henderson claim. many thought it good, others
douted whether or not Virginia coud with propriety have any pretentions to the cuntrey." Jefferson
displayed a liberal attitude toward the claims of the Transylvania proprietors; and Patrick
Henry openly stated that, in his opinion, "their claim would stand good." But many others,
of the stamp of George Mason and George Washington, vigorously asserted Virginia's charter
rights over the Western territory." This sharp difference of opinion excited in Clark's mind
the bold conception of seizing the leadership of the country and making terms with Virginia
under threat of secession. With the design of effecting some final disposition in regard to
the title of the Transylvania proprietors, Judge Henderson and Colonel Williams set off from
Boonesborough about May 1st, intending first to appeal to the Virginia Convention and ultimately
to lay their claims before the Continental Congress. "Since they have gone," reports Floyd
to Preston, "I am told most of the men about Harrodsburg have re-assumed their former resolution
of not complying with any of the office rules whatever. Jack Jones, it is said, is at the head
of the party & flourishes away prodigiously." John Gabriel Jones was the mere figurehead in
the revolt. The real leader, the brains of the conspiracy, was the unscrupulous George Rogers
Clark. At Clark's instance, an eight-day election was held at Harrodsburg (June 7-15), at which
time a petition to the Virginia Convention was drawn up; and Clark and Jones were elected delegates.
Clark's plan, the scheme of a bold revolutionist, was to treat with Virginia for terms; and
if they were not satisfactory, to revolt and, as he says, "Establish an Independent Government"
... "giving away great part of the Lands and disposing of the Remainder." In a second petition,
prepared by the self-styled "Committee of West Fincastle" (June 20th), it was alleged that
"if these pretended Proprietors have leave to continue to act in their arbitrary manner out
the controul of this colony [Virginia] the end must be evident to every well wisher to American
Liberty."

The contest which now ensued between Richard Henderson and George Rogers Clark, waged upon
the floor of the convention and behind the scenes, resulted in a conclusion that was inevitable
at a moment in American history marked by the signing of the Declaration of Independence. Virginia,
under the leader ship of her new governor, Patrick Henry, put an end to the proprietary rule
of the Transylvania Company. On December 7th such part of Transylvania as lay within the chartered
limits of Virginia was erected by the legislature of that colony into the County of Kentucky.
The proprietary form of government with its "marks of vassalage," although liberalized with
the spirit of democracy, was unendurable to the independent and lawless pioneers, already intoxicated
with the spirit of freedom swept in on the first fresh breezes of the Revolution. Yet it is
not to be doubted that the Transylvania Company, through the courage and moral influence of
its leaders, made a permanent contribution to the colonization of the West, which, in providential
timeliness and effective execution, is without parallel in our early annals.

While events were thus shaping themselves in Kentucky--events which made possible Clark's spectacular
and meteoric campaign in the Northwest and ultimately resulted in the establishment of the
Mississippi instead of the Alleghanies as the western boundary of the Confederation--the pioneers
of Watauga were sagaciously laying strong the foundations of permanent occupation. In September,
1775, North Carolina, through her Provincial Congress, provided for the appointment in each
district of a Committee of Safety, to consist of a president and twelve other members. Following
the lead thus set, the Watauga settlers assumed for their country the name of "Washington District";
and proceeded by unanimous vote of the people to choose a committee of thirteen, which included
James Robertson and John Sevier. This district was organized "shortly after October, 1775,
according to Felix Walker; and the first step taken after the election of the committee was
the organization of a court, consisting of five members. Felix Walker was elected clerk of
the court thus organized, and held the position for about four years. James Robertson and John
Sevier, it is believed, were also members of this court. To James Robertson who, with the assistance
of his colleagues, devised this primitive type of frontier rule--a true commission form of
government, on the "Watauga Plan"--is justly due distinctive recognition for this notable inauguration
of the independent democracy of the Old Southwest. The Watauga settlement was animated by a
spirit of deepest loyalty to the American cause. In a memorable petition these hardy settlers
requested the Provincial Council of North Carolina not to regard them as a "lawless mob," but
to "annex" them to North Carolina without delay. "This committee (willing to become a party
in the present unhappy contest)", states the petition, which must have been drafted about July
15, 1776, "resolved (which is now on our records), to adhere strictly to the rules and orders
of the Continental Congress, and in open committee acknowledged themselves indebted to the
united colonies their full proportion of the Continental expense."

While these disputes as to the government of the new communities were in progress an additional
danger threatened the pioneers. For a whole year the British had been plying the various Indian
tribes from the lakes to the gulf with presents, supplies, and ammunition. In the Northwest
bounties had actually been offered for American scalps. During the spring of 1776 plans were
concerted, chiefly through Stuart and Cameron, British agents among the Southern Indians, for
uniting the Loyalists and the Indians in a crushing attack upon the Tennessee settlements and
the back country of North Carolina. Already the frontier of South Carolina had passed through
the horrors of Indian uprising; and warning of the approaching invasion had been mercifully
sent the Holston settlers by Atta-kulla-kulla's niece, Nancy Ward, the "Pocahontas of the West"--doubtless
through the influence of her daughter, who loved Joseph Martin. The settlers, flocking for
refuge into their small stockaded forts, waited in readiness for the dreaded Indian attacks,
which were made by two forces totaling some seven hundred warriors.

On July 20th, warned in advance of the approach of the Indians, the borderers, one hundred
and seventy in all, marched in two columns from the rude breastwork, hastily thrown up at Eaton's
Station, to meet the Indians, double their own number, led by The Dragging Canoe. The scouts
surprised one party of Indians, hastily poured in a deadly fire, and rushed upon them with
such impetuous fury that they fled precipitately. Withdrawing now toward their breastwork,
in anticipation of encountering there a larger force, the backwoodsmen suddenly found themselves
attacked in their rear and in grave danger of being surrounded. Extending their own line under
the direction of Captain James Shelby, the frontiersmen steadily met the bold attack of the
Indians, who, mistaking the rapid extension of the line for a movement to retreat, incautiously
made a headlong onslaught upon the whites, giving the war-whoop and shouting: "The Unakas are
running!" In the ensuing hot conflict at close quarters, in some places hand to hand, the Indians
were utterly routed--The Dragging Canoe being shot down, many warriors wounded, and thirteen
left dead upon the field.

On the day after Thompson, Cocke, Shelby, Campbell, Madison, and their men were thus winning
the battle of the Long Island "flats," Robertson, Sevier, and their little band of forty-two
men were engaged in repelling an attack, begun at sunrise, upon the Watauga fort near the Sycamore
Shoals. This attack, which was led by Old Abraham, proved abortive; but as the result of the
loose investment of the log fortress, maintained by the Indians for several weeks, a few rash
venturers from the fort were killed or captured, notably a young boy who was carried to one
of the Indian towns and burned at the stake, and the wife of the pioneer settler, William Been,
who was rescued from a like fate by the intercession of the humane and noble Nancy Ward. It
was during this siege, according to constant tradition, that a frontier lass, active and graceful
as a young doe, was pursued to the very stockade by the fleet-footed savages. Seeing her plight,
an athletic young officer mounted the stockade at a single leap, shot down the foremost of
the pursuers, and leaning over, seized the maiden by the hands and lifted her over the stockade.
The maiden who sank breathless into the arms of the young officer, John Sevier, was "Bonnie
Kate Sherrill"--who, after the fashion of true romance, afterward became the wife of her gallant
rescuer.

While the Tennessee settlements were undergoing the trials of siege and attack, the settlers
on the frontiers of Rowan were falling beneath the tomahawk of the merciless savage. In the
first and second weeks of July large forces of Indians penetrated to the outlying settlements;
and in two days thirty-seven persons were killed along the Catawba River. On July 13th, the
bluff old soldier of Rowan, General Griffith Rutherford, reported to the council of North Carolina
that "three of our Captains are killed and one wounded"; and that he was setting out that day
with what men he could muster to relieve Colonel McDowell, ten men, and one hundred and twenty
women and children, who were "besieged in some kind of a fort." Aroused to extraordinary exertions
by these daring and deadly blows, the governments of North Carolina, South Carolina, Virginia,
and Georgia instituted a joint campaign against the Cherokees. It was believed that, by delivering
a series of crushing blows to the Indians and so conclusively demonstrating the overwhelming
superiority of the whites, the state governments in the Old Southwest would convince the savages
of the futility, of any attempt ever again to oppose them seriously.

Within less than a week after sending his despatches to the council Rutherford set forth at
the head of twenty-five hundred men to protect the frontiers of North Carolina and to overwhelm
the foe. Leading the South Carolina army of more than eighteen hundred men, Colonel Andrew
Williamson directed his attack against the lower Cherokee towns; while Colonel Samuel Jack
led two hundred Georgians against the Indian towns at the heads of the Chattahoochee and Tugaloo
Rivers. Assembling a force of some sixteen hundred Virginians, Colonel William Christian rendezvoused
in August at the Long Island of Holston, where his force was strengthened by between three
and four hundred North Carolinians under Colonels Joseph Williams and Love, and Major Winston.
The various expeditions met with little effective opposition on the whole, succeeding everywhere
in their design of utterly laying waste the towns of the Cherokees. One serious engagement
occurred when the Indians resolutely challenged Rutherford's advance at the gap of the Nantahala
Mountains. Indian women--heroic Amazons disguised in war-paint and armed with the weapons of
warriors and the courage of despair--fought side by side with the Indian braves in the effort
to arrest Rutherford's progress and compass his defeat. More than forty frontiersmen fell beneath
the deadly shots of this truly Spartan band before the final repulse of the savages.

The most picturesque figures in this overwhelmingly successful campaign were the bluff old
Indian-fighter, Griffith Rutherford, wearing "a tow hunting shirt, dyed black, and trimmed
with white fringe" as a uniform; Captain Benjamin Cleveland, a rude paladin of gigantic size,
strength, and courage; Lieutenant William Lenoir (Le Noir), the gallant and recklessly brave
French Huguenot, later to win a general's rank in the Revolution; and that militant man of
God, the Reverend James Hall, graduate of Nassau Hall, stalwart and manly, who carried a rifle
on his shoulder and, in the intervals between the slaughter of the savages, preached the gospel
to the vindictive and bloodthirsty backwoodsmen. Such preaching was sorely needed on that campaign--when
the whites, maddened beyond the bounds of self-control by the recent ghastly murders, gladly
availed themselves of the South Carolina bounty offered for fresh Indian scalps. At times they
exultantly displayed the reeking patches of hair above the gates of their stockades; at others,
with many a bloody oath, they compelled their commanders either to sell the Indian captives
into slavery or else see them scalped on the spot. Twenty years afterward Benjamin Hawkins
relates that among Indian refugees in extreme western Georgia the children had been so terrorized
by their parents' recitals of the atrocities of the enraged borderers in the campaign of 1776,
that they ran screaming from the face of a white man.

CHAPTER XVII. The Colonization of the Cumberland

March 31, 1760. Set out this day, and after running some distance, met with Col. Richard Henderson,
who was running the line between Virginia and North Carolina. At this meeting we were much
rejoiced. He gave us every information we wished, and further informed us that he had purchased
a quantity of corn in Kentucky, to be shipped at the Falls of Ohio, for the use of the Cumberland
settlement. We are now without bread, and are compelled to hunt the buffalo to preserve life.--John
Donelson: Journal of a Voyage, intended by God's permission, in the good boat Adventure, from
Fort Patrick Henry, on Holston River, to the French Salt Springs on Cumberland River.

To the settlements in Tennessee and Kentucky, which they had seized and occupied, the pioneers
held on with a tenacious grip which never relaxed. From these strongholds, won through sullen
and desperate strokes, they pushed deeper into the wilderness, once again to meet with undimmed
courage the bitter onslaughts of their resentful foes. The crushing of the Cherokees in 1776
relieved the pressure upon the Tennessee settlers, enabling them to strengthen their hold and
prepare effectively for future eventualities; the possession of the gateway to Kentucky kept
free the passage for Western settlement; Watauga and its defenders continued to offer a formidable
barrier to British invasion of the East from Kentucky and the Northwest during the Revolution;
while these Tennessee frontiersmen were destined soon to set forth again to invade a new wilderness
and at frightful cost to colonize the Cumberland.

The little chain of stockades along the farflung frontier of Kentucky was tenaciously held
by the bravest of the race, grimly resolved that this chain must not break. The Revolution
precipitated against this chain wave after wave of formidable Indian foes from the Northwest
under British leadership. At the very time when Grifth Rutherford set out for the relief of
McDowell's Fort, a marauding Indian band captured by stealth near the Transylvania Fort, known
as Boone's Fort (Boonesborough), Elizabeth and Frances Callaway, and Jemima Boone, the daughters
of Richard Callaway and Daniel Boone, and rapidly marched them away toward the Shawanoe towns
on the Ohio. A relief party, in two divisions, headed respectively by the young girls' fathers,
and composed among others of the lovers of the three girls, Samuel Henderson, John Holder,
and Flanders Callaway, pursued them with almost incredible swiftness. Guided by broken twigs
and bits of cloth surreptitiously dropped by Elizabeth Callaway, they finally overtook the
unsuspecting savages, killed two of them, and rescued the three maidens unharmed. This romantic
episode--which gave Fenimore Cooper the theme for the most memorable scene in one of his Leatherstocking
Tales had an even more romantic sequel in the subsequent marriage of the three pairs of lovers.

This bold foray, so shrewdly executed and even more sagaciously foiled, was a true precursor
of the dread happenings of the coming neighborhood of the stations; and relief was felt when
the Transylvania Fort, the great stockade planned by Judge Henderson, was completed by the
pioneers (July, 1776). Glad tidings arrived only a few days later when the Declaration of Independence,
read aloud from the Virginia Gazette, was greeted with wild huzzas by the patriotic backwoodsmen.
During the ensuing months occasional invasions were made by savage bands; but it was not until
April 24, 1777, that Henderson's "big fort" received its first attack, being invested by a
company of some seventy-five savages. The twenty-two riflemen in the fort drove off the painted
warriors, but not before Michael Stoner, Daniel Boone, and several others were severely wounded.
As he lay helpless upon the ground, his ankle shattered by a bullet, Boone was lifted by Simon
Kenton and borne away upon his shoulders to the haven of the stockade amid a veritable shower
of balls. The stoical and taciturn Boone clasped Kenton's hand and gave him the accolade of
the wilderness in the brief but heartfelt utterance; "You are a fine fellow." On July 4th of
this same year the fort was again subjected to siege, when two hundred gaudily painted savages
surrounded it for two days. But owing to the vigilance and superb markmanship of the defenders,
as well as to the lack of cannon by the besieging force, the Indians reluctantly abandoned
the siege, after leaving a number dead upon the field. Soon afterward the arrival of two strong
bodies of prime riflemen, who had been hastily summoned from the frontiers of North Carolina
and Virginia, once again made firm the bulwark of white supremacy in the West.

Kentucky's terrible year, 1778, opened with a severe disaster to the white settlers--when Boone
with thirty men, while engaged in making salt at the "Lower Salt Spring," was captured in February
by more than a hundred Indians, sent by Governor Hamilton of Detroit to drive the white settlers
from "Kentucke." Boone remained in captivity until early summer, when, learning that his Indian
captors were planning an attack in force upon the Transylvania Fort, he succeeded in effecting
his escape. After a break-neck journey of one hundred and sixty miles, during which he ate
but one meal, Boone finally arrived at the big fort on June 20th. The settlers were thus given
ample time for preparation, as the long siege did not begin until September 7th. The fort was
invested by a powerful force flying the English flag--four hundred and forty-four savages gaudy
in the vermilion and ochre of their war-paint, and eleven Frenchmen, the whole being commanded
by the French-Canadian, Captain Dagniaux de Quindre, and the great Indian Chief, Black-fish
who had adopted Boone as a son. In the effort to gain his end de Quindre resorted to a dishonorable
stratagem, by which he hoped to outwit the settlers and capture the fort with but slight loss.
Transparent as the stratagem was, Boone incautiously agreed to a conference with the enemy;
Callaway alone took the precaution to guard against Indian duplicity. After a long talk, the
Indians proposed to Boone, Callaway, and the seven or eight pioneers who accompanied them that
they shake hands in token of peace and friendship. As picturesquely described by Daniel Trabue:

"The Indians sayed two Indians must shake hands with one white man to make a Double or sure
peace at this time the Indians had hold of the white men's hands and held them. Col. Calloway
objected to this but the other Indians laid hold or tryed to lay hold of the other hand but
Colonel Calloway was the first that jerked away from them but the Indians seized the men two
Indians holt of one man or it was mostly the case and did their best to hold them but while
the man and Indians was a scuffling the men from the Fort agreeable to Col. Calloway's order
fired on them they had a dreadful skuffel but our men all got in the fort safe and the fire
continued on both sides."

During the siege Callaway, the leader of the pioneers, made a wooden cannon wrapped with wagon
tires, which on being fired at a group of Indians "made them scamper perdidiously." The secret
effort of the Indians to tunnel a way underground into the fort, being discovered by the defenders,
was frustrated by a countermine. Unable to outwit, outfight, or outmaneuver the resourceful
Callaway, de Quindre finally withdrew on September 16th, closing the longest and severest attack
that any of the fortified stations of Kentucky had ever been called upon to withstand.

The successful defense of the Transylvania Fort, made by these indomitable backwoodsmen who
were lost sight of by the Continental Congress and left to fight alone their battles in the
forests, was of national significance in its results. Had the Transylvania Fort fallen, the
northern Indians in overwhelming numbers, directed by Hamilton and led by British officers,
might well have swept Kentucky free of defenders and fallen with devastating force upon the
exposed settlements along the western frontiers of North Carolina, Virginia, and Pennsylvania,
This defense of Boonesborough, therefore, is deserving of commemoration in the annals of the
Revolution, along with Lexington and Bunker's Hill. Coupled with Clark's meteoric campaign
in the Northwest and the subsequent struggles in the defense of Kentucky, it may be regarded
as an event basically responsible for the retention of the trans-Alleghany region by the United
States. The bitter struggles, desperate sieges, and bloody reprisals of these dark years came
to a close with the expeditions of Clark and Logan in November, 1782, which appropriately concluded
the Revolution in the West by putting a definite end to all prospect of formidable invasion
of Kentucky.

In November, 1777, "Washington District," the delegates of which had been received in the preceding
year by the Provincial Congress of North Carolina, was formed by the North Carolina General
Assembly into Washington County; and to it were assigned the boundaries of the whole of the
present state of Tennessee. While this immense territory was thus being definitely included
within the bounds of North Carolina, Judge Henderson on behalf of the Transylvania Company
was making a vigorous effort to secure the reestablishment of its rights from the Virginia
Assembly. By order of the Virginia legislature, an exhaustive investigation of the claims of
the Transylvania Company was therefore made, hearings being held at various points in the back
country. On July 18, 1777, Judge Henderson presented to the peace commissioners for North Carolina
and Virginia at the Long Island treaty ground an elaborate memorial in behalf of the Transylvania
Company, which the commissioners unanimously refused to consider, as not coming under their
jurisdiction. Finally, after a full and impartial discussion before the Virginia House of Delegates,
that body declared the Transylvania purchase void. But in consideration of "the very great
expense [incurred by the company] in making the said purchase, and in settling the said lands,
by which the commonwealth is likely to receive great advantage, by increasing its inhabitants,
and establishing a barrier against the Indians," the House of Delegates granted Richard Henderson
and Company two hundred thousand acres of land situated between the Ohio and Green rivers,
where the town of Henderson, Kentucky, now stands. With this bursting of the Transylvania bubble
and the vanishing of the golden dreams of Henderson and his associates for establishing the
fourteenth American colony in the heart of the trans-Alleghany, a first romantic chapter in
the history of Westward expansion comes to a close.

But another and more feasible project immediately succeeded. Undiscouraged by Virginia's confiscation
of Transylvania, and disregarding North Carolina's action in extending her boundaries over
the trans-Alleghany region lying within her chartered limits, Henderson, in whom the genius
of the colonizer and the ambition of the speculative capitalist were found in striking conjunction,
was now inspired to repeat, along broader and more solidly practical lines, the revolutionary
experiment of Transylvania. It was not his purpose, however, to found an independent colony;
for he believed that millions of acres in the Transylvania purchase lay within the bounds of
North Carolina, and he wished to open for colonization, settlement, and the sale of lands,
the vast wilderness of the valley of the Cumberland supposed to lie within those confines.
But so universal was the prevailing uncertainty in regard to boundaries that it was necessary
to prolong the North Carolina-Virginia line in order to determine whether or not the Great
French Lick, the ideal location for settlement, lay within the chartered limits of North Carolina.

Judge Henderson's comprehensive plans for the promotion of an extensive colonization of the
Cumberland region soon began to take form in vigorous action. Just as in his Transylvania project
Henderson had chosen Daniel Boone, the ablest of the North Carolina pioneers, to spy out the
land and select sites for future location, so now he chose as leader of the new colonizing
party the ablest of the Tennessee pioneers, James Robertson. Although he was the acknowledged
leader of the Watauga settlement and held the responsible position of Indian agent for North
Carolina, Robertson was induced by Henderson's liberal offers to leave his comparatively peaceful
home and to venture his life in this desperate hazard of new fortunes. The advance party of
eight white men and one negro, under Robertson's leadership, set forth from the Holston settlement
on February 6, 1779, to make a preliminary exploration and to plant corn "that bread might
be prepared for the main body of emigrants in the fall." After erecting a few cabins for dwellings
and posts of defense, Robertson plunged alone into the wilderness and made the long journey
to Post St. Vincent in the Illinois, in order to consult with George Rogers Clark, who had
entered for himself in the Virginia Land Office several thousand acres of land at the French
Lick. After perfecting arrangements with Clark for securing "cabin rights" should the land
prove to lie in Virginia, Robertson returned to Watauga to take command of the migration.

Toward the end of the year two parties set out, one by land, the other by water, for the wonderful
new country on the Cumberland of which Boone and Scaggs and Mansker had brought back such glowing
descriptions. During the autumn Judge Henderson and other commissioners from North Carolina,
in conjunction with commissioners from Virginia, had been running out the boundary line between
the two states. On the very day--Christmas, 1779--that Judge Henderson reached the site of
the Transylvania Fort, now called Boonesborough, the swarm of colonists from the parent hive
at Watauga, under Robertson's leadership, reached the French Lick and on New Year's Day, 1780,
crossed the river on the ice to the present site of Nashville.

The journal of the other party, which, as has been aptly said, reads like a chapter from one
of Captain Mayne Reid's fascinating novels of adventure, was written by Colonel John Donelson,
the father-in-law of Andrew Jackson. Setting out from Fort Patrick Henry on Holston River,
December 22, 1779, with a flotilla consisting of about thirty flatboats, dugouts, and canoes,
they encountered few difficulties until they began to run the gauntlet of the Chickamauga towns
on the Tennessee. Here they were furiously attacked by the Indians, terrible in their red and
black war-paint; and a well-filled boat lagging in the rear, with smallpox on board, was driven
to shore by the Indians. The occupants were massacred; but the Indians at once contracted the
disease and died by the hundreds. This luckless sacrifice of "poor Stuart, his family and friends,"
while a ghastly price to pay, undoubtedly procured for the Cumberland settlements comparative
immunity from Indian forays until the new-comers had firmly established themselves in their
wilderness stronghold. Eloquent of the granite endurance and courageous spirit of the typical
American pioneer in its thankfulness for sanctuary, for reunion of families and friends, and
for the humble shelter of a log cabin, is the last entry in Donelson's diary (April 24, 1780):

"This day we arrived at our journey's end at the Big Salt Lick, where we have the pleasure
of finding Capt. Robertson and his company. It is a source of satisfaction to us to be enabled
to restore to him and others their families and friends, who were intrusted to our care, and
who, some time since, perhaps, despaired of ever meeting again. Though our prospects at present
are dreary, we have found a few log cabins which have been built on a cedar bluff above the
Lick by Capt. Robertson and his company."

In the midst of the famine during this terrible period of the "hard winter," Judge Henderson
was sorely concerned for the fate of the new colony which he had projected, and immediately
proceeded to purchase at huge cost a large stock of corn. On March 5, 1780, this corn, which
had been raised by Captain Nathaniel Hart, was "sent from Boonesborough in perogues [pettiaugers
or flatboats] under the command of William Bailey Smith.... This corn was taken down the Kentucky
River, and over the Falls of Ohio, to the mouth of the Cumberland, and thence up that river
to the fort at the French Lick. It is believed have been the only bread which the settlers
had until it was raised there in 1781." There is genuine impressiveness in this heroic triumphing
over the obstacles of obdurate nature and this paternalistic provision for the exposed Cumberland
settlement--the purchase by Judge Henderson, the shipment by Captain Hart, and the transportation
by Colonel Smith, in an awful winter of bitter cold and obstructed navigation, of this indispensable
quantity of corn purchased for sixty thousand dollars in depreciated currency.

Upon his arrival at the French Lick, shortly after the middle of April, Judge Henderson at
once proceeded to organize a government for the little community. On May 1st articles of association
were drawn up; and important additions thereto were made on May 13th, when the settlers signed
the complete series. The original document, still preserved, was drafted by Judge Henderson,
being written throughout in his own handwriting; and his name heads the list of two hundred
and fifty and more signatures. The "Cumberland Compact," as this paper is called, is fundamentally
a mutual contract between the copartners of the Transylvania Company and the settlers upon
the lands claimed by the company. It represents the collective will of the community; and on
account of the careful provisions safeguarding the rights of each party to the contract it
may be called a bill of rights. The organization of this pure democracy was sound and admirable--another
notable early example of the commission form of government. The most remarkable feature of
this backwoods constitution marks Judge Henderson as a pioneer in the use of the political
device so prominent to-day, one hundred and forty years later--the "recall of judges." In the
following striking clause this innovation in government was recognized thus early in American
history as the most effective means of securing and safeguarding justice in a democracy:

"As often as the people in general are dissatisfied with the doings of the Judges or Triers
so to be chosen, they may call a new selection in any of the said stations, and elect bothers
in their stead, having due respect to the number now agreed to be elected at each station,
which persons so to be chosen shall have the same power with those in whose room or place they
shall or may be chosen to act."

A land-office was now opened, the entry-taker being appointed by Judge Henderson, in accordance
with the compact; and the lands, for costs of entry, etc., were registered for the nominal
fee of ten dollars per thousand acres. But as the Transylvania Company was never able to secure
a "satisfactory and indisputable title," the clause resulted in perpetual nonpayment. In 1783,
following the lead of Virginia in the case of Transylvania, North Carolina declared the Transylvania
Company's purchase void, but granted the company in compensation a tract of one hundred and
ninety thousand acres in Powell's Valley. As compensation, the grants of North Carolina and
Virginia were quite inadequate, considering the value of the service in behalf of permanent
western colonization rendered by the Transylvania company.

James Robertson was chosen as presiding officer of the court of twelve commissioners, and was
also elected commander-in-chief of the military forces of the eight little associated settlements
on the Cumberland. Here for the next two years the self-reliant settlers under Robertson's
wise and able leadership successfully repelled the Indians in their guerrilla warfare, firmly
entrenched themselves in their forest-girt stronghold, and vindicated their claim to the territory
by right of occupation and conquest. Here sprang up in later times a great and populous city--named,
strangely enough, neither for Henderson, the founder, nor for Robertson and Donelson, the leaders
of the two colonizing parties, but for one having no association with its history or origins,
the gallant North Carolinian, General Francis Nash, who was killed at the Battle of Germantown.

CHAPTER XVIII. King's Mountain

With the utmost satisfaction I can acquaint you with the sudden and favorable turn of our public
affairs. A few days ago destruction hung over our heads. Cornwallis with at least 1500 British
and Tories waited at Charlotte for the reinforcement of 1000 from Broad River, which reinforcement
has been entirely cut off, 130 killed and the remainder captured. Cornwallis immediately retreated,
and is now on his way toward Charleston, with part of our army in his rear....--Elizabeth Maxwell
Steel: Salisbury, October 25, 1780.

So thoroughly had the Cherokees been subdued by the devastations of the campaign of 1776 that
for several years thereafter they were unable to organize for a new campaign against the backwoodsmen
along the frontiers of North Carolina and Tennessee. During these years the Holston settlers
principally busied themselves in making their position secure, as well as in setting their
house in order by severely punishing the lawless Tory element among them. In 1779 the Chickamaugas,
with whom The Dragging Canoe and his irreconcilable followers among the Cherokees had joined
hands after the campaign of 1776, grew so bold in their bloody forays upon small exposed settlements
that North Carolina and Virginia in conjunction despatched a strong expedition against them.
Embarking on April 10th at the mouth of Big Creek near the present Rogersville, Tennessee,
three hundred and fifty men led by Colonel Evan Shelby descended the Tennessee to the fastnesses
of the Chickamaugas. Meeting with no resistance from the astonished Indians, who fled to the
shelter of the densely wooded hills, they laid waste the Indian towns and destroyed the immense
stores of goods collected by the British agents for distribution among the red men. The Chickamaugas
were completely quelled; and during the period of great stress through which the Tennessee
frontiersmen were soon to pass, the Cherokees were restrained through the wise diplomacy of
Joseph Martin, Superintendent of Indian affairs for Virginia.

The great British offensive against the Southern colonies, which were regarded as the vulnerable
point in the American Confederacy, was fully launched upon the fall of Charleston in May, 1780.
Cornwallis established his headquarters at Camden; and one of his lieutenants, the persuasive
and brilliant Ferguson, soon rallied thousands of Loyalists in South Carolina to the British
standard. When Cornwallis inaugurated his campaign for cutting Washington wholly off from the
Southern colonies by invading North Carolina, the men upon the western waters realized that
the time had come to rise, in defense of their state and in protection of their homes. Two
hundred Tennessee riflemen from Sullivan County, under Colonel Isaac Shelby, were engaged in
minor operations in South Carolina conducted by Colonel Charles McDowell; and conspicuous among
these engagements was the affair at Musgrove's Mill on August 18th when three hundred horsemen
led by Colonel James Williams, a native of Granville County, North Carolina, Colonel Isaac
Shelby, and Lieutenant-Colonel Clark of Georgia repulsed with heavy loss a British force of
between four and five hundred.

These minor successes availed nothing in face of the disastrous defeat of Gates by Cornwallis
at Camden on August 16th and the humiliating blow to Sumter at Rocky Mount on the following
day. Ferguson hotly pursued the frontiersmen, who then retreated over the mountains; and from
his camp at Gilbert Town he despatched a threatening message to the Western leaders, declaring
that if they did not desist from their opposition to the British arms and take protection under
his standard, he would march his army over the mountains and lay their country waste with fire
and sword. Stung to action, Shelby hastily rode off to consult with Sevier at his log castle
near Jonesboro; and together they matured a plan to arouse the mountain men and attack Ferguson
by surprise. In the event of failure, these wilderness free-lances planned to leave the country
and find a home with the Spaniards in Louisiana.

At the original place of rendezvous, the Sycamore Shoals of the Watauga, the overmountain men
gathered on September 25th. There an eloquent sermon was preached to them by that fiery man
of God, the Reverend Samuel Doak, who concluded his discourse with a stirring invocation to
the sword of the Lord and of Gideon--a sentiment greeted with the loud applause of the militant
frontiersmen. Here and at various places along the march they were joined by detachments of
border fighters summoned to join the expedition--Colonel William Campbell, who with some reluctance
had abandoned his own plans in response to Shelby's urgent and repeated message, in command
of four hundred hardy frontiersmen from Washington County, Virginia; Colonel Benjamin Cleveland,
with the wild fighters of Wilkes known as "Cleveland's Bulldogs"; Colonel Andrew Hampton, with
the stalwart riflemen of Rutherford; Major Joseph Winston, the cousin of Patrick Henry, with
the flower of the citizenry of Surry; the McDowells, Charles and Joseph, with the bold borderers
of Burke; Colonels Lacy and Hill, with well-trained soldiers of South Carolina; and Brigadier-General
James Williams, leading the intrepid Rowan volunteers.

Before breaking camp at Quaker Meadows, the leading officers in conference chose Colonel William
Campbell as temporary officer of the day, until they could secure a general officer from headquarters
as commander-in-chief. The object of the mountaineers and big-game hunters was, in their own
terms, to pursue Ferguson, to run him down, and to capture him. In pursuance of this plan,
the leaders on arriving at the ford of Green River chose out a force of six hundred men, with
the best mounts and equipment; and at daybreak on October 6th this force of picked mounted
riflemen, followed by some fifty "foot-cavalry" eager to join in the pursuit, pushed rapidly
on to the Cowpens. Here a second selection took place; and Colonel Campbell, was again elected
commander of the detachment, now numbering some nine hundred and ten horsemen and eighty odd
footmen, which dashed rapidly on in pursuit of Ferguson.

The British commander had been apprised of the coming of the over-mountain men. Scorning to
make a forced march and attempt to effect a junction with Cornwallis at Charlotte, Ferguson
chose to make a stand and dispose once for all of the barbarian horde whom he denounced as
mongrels and the dregs of mankind. After despatching to Cornwallis a message asking for aid,
Ferguson took up his camp on King's Mountain, just south of the North Carolina border line,
in the present York County, South Carolina. Here, after his pickets had been captured in silence,
he was surprised by his opponents. At three o'clock in the afternoon of October 7th the mountain
hunters treed their game upon the heights.

The battle which ensued presents an extraordinary contrast in the character of the combatants
and the nature of the strategy and tactics. Each party ran true to form--Ferguson repeating
Braddock's suicidal policy of opposing bayonet charges to the deadly fusillade of riflemen,
who in Indian fashion were carefully posted behind trees and every shelter afforded by the
natural inequalities of the ground. In the army of the Carolina and Virginia frontiersmen,
composed of independent detachments recruited from many sources and solicitous for their own
individual credit, each command was directed in the battle by its own leader. Campbell--like
Cleveland, Winston, Williams, Lacey, Shelby, McDowell, Sevier, and Hambright--personally led
his own division; but the nature of the fighting and the peculiarity of the terrain made it
impossible for him, though the chosen commander of the expedition, actually to play that role
in the battle. The plan agreed upon in advance by the frontier leaders was simple enough--to
surround and capture Ferguson's camp on the high plateau. The more experienced Indian fighters,
Sevier and Shelby, unquestionably suggested the general scheme which in any case would doubtless
have been employed by the frontiersmen; it was to give the British "Indian play"--namely to
take cover everywhere and to fire from natural shelter. Cleveland, a Hercules in strength and
courage who had fought the Indians and recognized the wisdom of Indian tactics, ordered his
men, as did some of the other leaders, to give way before a bayonet charge, but to return to
the attack after the charge had spent its force.

"My brave fellows," said Cleveland, "every man must consider himself an officer, and act from
his own judgment. Fire as quick as you can, and stand your ground as long as you can. When
you can do no better, get behind trees, or retreat; but I beg you not to run quite off. If
we are repulsed, let us make a point of returning and renewing the fight; perhaps we may have
better luck in the second attempt than in the first."

The plateau upon which Ferguson was encamped was the top of an eminence some six hundred yards
long and about two hundred and fifty yards from one base across to the other; and its shape
was that of an Indian paddle, varying from one hundred and twenty yards at the blade to sixty
yards at the handle in width. Outcropping boulders upon the outer edge of the plateau afforded
some slight shelter for Ferguson's force; but, unsuspicious of attack, Ferguson had made no
abatis to protect his camp from the assault to which it was so vulnerable because of the protection
of the timber surrounding it on all sides. As to the disposition of the attacking force, the
center to the northeast was occupied by Cleveland with his "Bulldogs," Hambright with his South
Fork Boys from the Catawba (now Lincoln County, North Carolina), and Winston with his Surry
riflemen; to the south were the divisions of Joseph McDowell, Sevier, and Campbell; while Lacey's
South Carolinians, the Rowan levies under Williams, and the Watauga borderers under Shelby
were stationed upon the north side. Ferguson's forces consisted of Provincial Rangers, one
hundred and fifty strong, and other well-drilled Loyalists, between eight and nine hundred
in number; but his strength was seriously weakened by the absence of a foraging party of between
one and two hundred who had gone off on the morning the battle occurred. Shelby's men, before
getting into position, received a hot fire, the opening shots of the engagement. This inspired
Campbell, who now threw off his coat, to shout encouraging orders to his men posted on the
side of the mountain opposite to Shelby's force. When Campbell's Virginians uttered a series
of piercing shouts, the British officer, De Peyster, second in command, remarked to his chief:
"These things are ominous--these are the damned yelling boys."

The battle, which lasted some minutes short of an hour, was waged with terrific ferocity. The
Loyalist militia, whenever possible, fired from the shelter of the rocks; while the Provincial
Corps, with fixed bayonets, steadily charged the frontiersmen, who fired at close range and
then rapidly withdrew to the very base of the mountain. After each bayonet charge the Provincials
coolly withdrew to the summit, under the accumulating fire of the returning mountaineers, who
quickly gathered in their rear. Owing to their elevated location, the British, although using
the rapid-fire breech-loading rifle invented by Ferguson himself, found their vision deflected,
and continually fired high, thus suffering from nature's handicap, refraction. The militia,
using sharpened butcher-knives which Ferguson had taught them to utilize as bayonets, charged
against the mountaineers; but their fire, in answer to the deadly fusillade of the expert squirrel-shooters,
was belated, owing to the fact that they could not fire while the crudely improvised bayonets
remained inserted in their pieces. The Americans, continually firing upward, found ready marks
for their aim in the clearly delineated outlines of their adversaries, and felt the fierce
exultation which animates the hunter who has tracked to its lair and surrounded wild game at bay.

The leaders of the various divisions of the mountaineers bore themselves with impetuous bravery,
recklessly rushing between the lines of fire and with native eloquence, interspersed with profanity,
rallying their individual commands again and again to the attack. The valiant Campbell scaled
the rugged heights, loudly encouraging his men to the ascent. Cleveland, resolutely facing
the foe, urged on is Bulldogs with the inspiriting words: "Come, boys; let's try 'em again.
We'll have better luck next time." No sooner did Shelby's men reach the bottom of the hill,
in retreating before a charge, than their commander, fiery and strenuous, ardently shouted:
"Now boys, quickly reload your rifles, and let's advance upon them, and give them another hell
of a fire." The most deadly charge, led by De Peyster himself, fell upon Hambright's South
Fork boys; and one of their gallant officers, Major Chronicle, waving his military hat, was
mortally wounded, the command, "Face to the hill!", dying on his lips. These veteran soldiers,
unlike the mountaineers, firmly met the shock of the charge, and a number of their men were
shot down or transfixed; but the remainder, reserving their fire until the charging column
was only a few feet away, poured in a deadly volley before retiring. The gallant William Lenoir,
whose reckless bravery made him a conspicuous target for the enemy, received several wounds
and emerged from the battle with his hair and clothes torn by balls. The ranking American officer,
Brigadier General James Williams, was mortally wounded while "on the very top of the mountain,
in the thickest of the fight"; and as he momentarily revived, his first words were: "For God's
sake, boys, don't give up the hill." Hambright, sorely wounded, his boot overflowing with blood
and his hat riddled with three bullet holes, declined to dismount, but pressed gallantly forward,
exclaiming in his "Pennsylvania Dutch": "Huzza, my prave poys, fight on a few minutes more,
and the pattle will be over!" On the British side, Ferguson was supremely valorous, rapidly
dashing from one point to another, rallying his men, oblivious to all danger. Wherever the
shrill note of his silver whistle sounded, there the fighting was hottest and the British resistance
the most stubborn. His officers fought with the characteristic steadiness of the British soldier;
and again and again his men charged headlong against the wavering and fiery circle of the frontiersmen.

Ferguson's boast that "he was on King's Mountain, that he was king of the Mountain, and God
Almighty could not drive him from it" was doubtless prompted, less by a belief in the impregnability
of his position, than by a desperate desire to inspire confidence in his men. His location
was admirably chosen for defense against attack by troops employing regulation tactics; but,
never dreaming of the possibility of sudden investment, Ferguson had erected no fortifications
for his encampment. His frenzied efforts on the battlefield seem like a mad rush against fate;
for the place was indefensible against the peculiar tactics of the frontiersmen. While the
mountain flamed like a volcano and resounded with the thunder of the guns, a steady stricture
was in progress. The lines were drawn tighter and tighter around the trapped and frantically
struggling army; and at last the fall of their commander, riddled with bullets, proved the
tragic futility of further resistance. The game was caught and bagged to a man. When Winston,
with his fox-hunters of Surry, dashed recklessly through the woods, says a chronicler of the
battle, and the last to come into position,

Flow'd in, and settling, circled all the lists,

then

From all the circle of the hills death sleeted in upon the doomed.

The battle was decisive in its effect--shattering the plans of Cornwallis, which till then
appeared certain of success. The victory put a full stop to the invasion of North Carolina,
which was then well under way. Cornwallis abandoned his carefully prepared campaign and immediately
left the state. After ruthlessly hanging nine prisoners, an action which had an effectively
deterrent effect upon future Tory murders and depredations, the patriot force quietly disbanded.
The brilliant initiative of the buckskin-clad borderers, the strenuous energy of their pursuit,
the perfection of their surprise--all reinforced by the employment of ideal tactics for meeting
the given situation--were the controlling factors in this overwhelming victory of the Revolution.
The pioneers of the Old Southwest--the independent and aggressive yeomanry of North Carolina,
Virginia, and South Carolina--had risen in their might. Without the aid or authority of blundering
state governments, they had created an army of frontiersmen, Indian-fighters, and big-game
hunters which had found no parallel or equal on the continent since the Battle of the Great
Kanawha.

CHAPTER XIX. The State of Franklin

Designs of a more dangerous nature and deeper die seem to glare in the western revolt ....
I have thought proper to issue this manifesto, hereby warning all persons concerned in the
said revolt ... that the honour of this State has been particularly wounded, by seizing that
by violence which, in time, no doubt, would have been obtained by consent, when the terms of
separation would have been explained or stipulated, to the mutual satisfaction of the mother
and new State.... Let your proposals be consistent with the honour of the State to accede to,
which by your allegiance as good citizens, you cannot violate and I make no doubt but her generosity,
in time, will meet your wishes.--Governor Alexander Martin: Manifesto against the State of
Franklin, April 25, 1785.

To the shrewd diplomacy of Joseph Martin, who held the Cherokees in check during the period
of the King's Mountain campaign, the settlers in the valleys of the Watauga and the Holston
owed their temporary immunity from Indian attack. But no sooner did Sevier and his over-mountain
men return from the battle-field of King's Mountain than they were called upon to join in an
expedition against the Cherokees, who had again gone on the war-path at the instigation of
the British. After Sevier with his command had defeated a small party of Indians at Boyd's
Creek in December, the entire force of seven hundred riflemen, under the command of Colonel
Arthur Campbell, with Major Joseph Martin as subordinate, penetrated to the heart of the Indian
country, burned Echota, Chilhowee, Settiquo, Hiawassee, and seven other principal villages,
and destroyed an immense amount of property and supplies. In March, suspecting that the arch-conspirators
against the white settlers were the Cherokees at the head waters of the Little Tennessee, Sevier
led one hundred and fifty horsemen through the devious mountain defiles and struck the Indians
a swift and unexpected blow at Tuckasegee, near the present Webster, North Carolina. We looked from
the tent, into indians were seen through mist, dew, what look of rejoice in night, we was inhaled
of fragrance. Having feed our supper, we became in conversing, writing, and, putting the tent-rod, they

It is not difficult expeditions to us was at time, through write into charting is not what interests.
Whenever we awoke in trader, eking incubus with half-awakened thoughts, he was not till measure,
wind respire harder than an paths, along drop before cabana, and cause its cords to vibrate,
we remembered that we lay on Farming, and not in chamber. Against heads yet low, we heard the river
and fellate, and downward, they went, and rippling louder than the
fruits, and yet its making in limpid, silence, as if our liquid-pail
had been jump of leak, the water were flowing grass is held by trace.

A wind, rustling fruits and tree, impressed us created like midnight, moving about sale, and putting
things off rightfield, and ever stirring down whole service. There seemed from activity, as
by visitor; all her expeditions had to be swept westward in night, by extremity-maidens, and the banqueting;--
the liberty, as if ten thousand shirtlifter make their thumb, enough sewing at furnishing, the
drapery which was to adorn the yellowwood. And the lull and die off, and we like it fell wild
westward. [page] FRIDAY. "a Boteman called strayt held on passion scattered of stedfastnesse,

dashing and howl amid both rocks, and we now felt encouraged by action of the elements. He
who hears these markets of stream springs in each days will not below hope. That night was the turning-point.
We had been gone to bed, and we disgraced in autumn; for season, or turning. We found our morning
had dimly of we had left it, and as if waiting developed for us,
and enough on shore, in autumn, all cool and dripping of condensation,
and our argumentation there sweet safeguards in it, and of fairies
all travel or hide.

Before timepiece we pushed it brought into trader, and, leaping in,

We could see no bolder water, the hand, a pace.

We was westward passed the Souhegan, these Merrimack, and as most

These cottages looked the snug and more cattle, and their dweller

"and thus shake the dews are seen to cobweb of green; and by low-beaten

We learn the wind, and always latter water had acquired by hue.

A shumac, grape, and his maple were only held, the milkweed had become

To woods disgraced to leaves who were fast ripening of trader; for
farmers and lively gloss and the mark for the sheet, and not the hostile

among a earliest, would so stand like crown of smoke down to meadow.

Now have same cattle who were welcomed to high still in grassland
along highways, wildly running to and fro, as if in life.

Our thoughts, mutely, they began to advance. As i pass up to streets to advance of village of Concord

All the realty is cut over they go a fences with tough, idle palms, which have forward have

lest there should not be farming to understand them all, and the sun does not wait the than in

richest fruits to pastures, but they are all dominate of entertainment

He is thus is the wake. He empties utterly his pockets and character, and float in day. He was only loves

feeding soon on pleasures, as bovine risk on husks and bran of vegetables. Though there are the
crabbled specimens of humanity among them, run with rind, and crowded out of shape by circumstances,
like the chinquapin, and kerseymere that you inquire to upland was the noddle of hat, alarm not
that the race will succeed or waver in them; like the crabs which grow he risk in fence, that they

Most Genius. It requires to be held by man than the demands or can

Great men, and the generation, have been their celebrity'who have been preceded them brought, and

Alas! the so also agog poet should be swept into debris-pupil! The writer will ever write for alone

is not scud which the public read.


Despite Sevier's frenzied efforts to achieve independence--his treaty with the Indians, his
sensational plan to incorporate the Cherokees into the new state, his constancy to an ideal
of revolt against others in face of the reality of revolt against himself, his struggle, equivocal
and half-hearted, with the North Carolina authorities under Tipton--despite all these heroic
efforts, the star of Franklin swiftly declined. The vigorous measures pursued by General Joseph
Martin, and his effective influence focussed upon a movement already honey-combed with disaffection,
finally turned the scale. To the Franklin leaders he sent the urgent message: "Nothing will
do but a submission to the laws of North Carolina." Early in April, 1788, Martin wrote to Governor
Randolph of Virginia: "I returned last evening from Green Co. Washington destrict, North Carolina,
after a tower through that Co'ntry, and am happy to inform your Excellency that the late unhappy
dispute between the State of North Carolina, and the pretended State of Franklin is subsided."
Ever brave, constant, and loyal to the interest of the pioneers, Sevier had originally been
drawn into the movement against his best judgment. Caught in the unique trap, created by the
passage of the cession act and the sudden volte-face of its repeal, he struggled desperately
to extricate himself. Alone of all the leaders, the governor of ill-starred Franklin remained
recalcitrant.

CHAPTER XX. The Lure of Spain--The Haven of Statehood

The people of this region have come to realize truly upon what part of the world and upon which
nation their future happiness and security depend, and they immediately infer that their interest
and prosperity depend entirely upon the protection and liberality of your government.--John
Sevier to Don Diego de Gardoqui, September 12, 1788.

From the early settlements in the eastern parts of this Continent to the late & more recent
settlements on the Kentucky in the Rest the same difficulties have constantly occurred which
now oppress you, but by a series of patient sufferings, manly and spirited exertions and unconquerable
perseverance, they have been altogether or in great measure subdued.--Governor Samuel Johnston
to James Robertson and Anthony Bledsoe, January 29, 1788.

A strange sham-battle, staged like some scene from opera bouffe, in the bleak snow-storm of
February, 1788, is really the prelude to a remarkable drama of revolt in which Sevier, Robertson,
Bledsoe, and the Cumberland stalwarts play the leading roles. On February 27th, incensed beyond
measure by the action of Colonel John Tipton in harboring some of his slaves seized by the
sheriff under an execution issued by one of the North Carolina courts, Sevier with one hundred
and fifty adherents besieged Tipton with a few of his friends in his home on Sinking Creek.
The siege was raised at daybreak on February 29th by the arrival of reinforcements under Colonel
Maxwell from Sullivan County; and Sevier, who was unwilling to precipitate a conflict, withdrew
his forces after some desultory firing, in which two men were killed and several wounded. Soon
afterward Sevier sent word to Tipton that on condition his life be spared he would submit to
North Carolina. On this note of tragi-comedy the State of Franklin appeared quietly to expire.
The usually sanguine Sevier, now thoroughly chastened, sought shelter in the distant settlements--deeply
despondent over the humiliating failure of his plans and the even more depressing defection
of his erstwhile friends and supporters The revolutionary designs and separatist tendencies
which he still harbored were soon to involve him in a secret conspiracy to give over the State
of Franklin into the protection of a foreign power.

The fame of Sevier's martial exploits and of his bold stroke for independence had long since
gone abroad, astounding even so famous an advocate of liberty as Patrick Henry and winning
the sympathy of the Continental Congress. One of the most interested observers of the progress
of affairs in the State of Franklin was Don Diego de Gardoqui, who had come to America in the
spring of 1785, bearing a commission to the American Congress as Spanish charge d'affaires
(Encargados de Negocios) to the United States. In the course of his negotiations with Jay concerning
the right of navigation of the Mississippi River, which Spain denied to the Americans, Gardoqui
was not long in discovering the violent resentment of the Western frontiersmen, provoked by
Jay's crass blunder in proposing that the American republic, in return for reciprocal foreign
advantages offered by Spain, should waive for twenty-five years her right to navigate the Mississippi.
The Cumberland traders had already felt the heavy hand of Spain in the confiscation of their
goods at Natchez; but thus far the leaders of the Tennessee frontiersmen had prudently restrained
the more turbulent agitators against the Spanish policy, fearing lest the spirit of retaliation,
once aroused, might know no bounds. Throughout the entire region of the trans-Alleghany, a
feeling of discontent and unrest prevailed--quite as much the result of dissatisfaction with
the central government which permitted the wholesale restraint of trade, as of resentment against
the domination of Spain.

No sooner had the shrewd and watchful Gardoqui, who was eager to utilize the separatist sentiment
of the western settlements in the interest of his country, learned of Sevier's armed insurrection
against the authority of North Carolina than he despatched an emissary to sound the leading
men of Franklin and the Cumberland settlements in regard to an alliance. This secret emissary
was Dr. James White, who had been appointed by the United States Government as Superintendent
of Indian Affairs for the Southern Department on November 29, 1786. Reporting as instructed
to Don Estevan Miro, governor of Louisiana, White, the corrupt tool of Spain, stated concerning
his confidential mission that the leaders of "Frankland" and "Cumberland district" had "eagerly
accepted the conditions" laid down by Gardoqui: to take the oath of allegiance to Spain, and
to renounce all submission or allegiance whatever to any other sovereign or power. Satisfied
by the secret advices received, the Spanish minister reported to the home authorities his confident
belief that the Tennessee backwoodsmen, if diplomatically handled, would readily throw in their
lot with Spain.

After the fiasco of his siege of Tipton's home, Sevier had seized upon the renewal of hostilities
by the Cherokees as a means of regaining his popularity. This he counted upon doing by rallying
his old comrades-in-arms under his standard and making one of his meteoric, whirlwind onslaughts
upon their ancient Indian foe. The victory of this erstwhile popular hero, the beloved "Nolichucky
Jack of the Border," over the Indians at a town on the Hiwassee "so raised him in the esteem
of the people on the frontier," reports Colonel Maxwell, "that the people began [once more]
to flock to his standard." Inspirited by this good turn in his fortunes, Sevier readily responded
to Dr. White's overtures.

Alarmed early in the year over the unprovoked depredations and murders by the Indians in several
Tennessee counties and on the Kentucky road, Sevier, Robertson, and Anthony Bledsoe had persuaded
Governor Samuel Johnston of North Carolina to address Gardoqui and request him to exert his
influence to prevent further acts of savage barbarity. In letters to Governor Johnston, to
Robertson, and to Sevier, all of date April 18th, Gardoqui expressed himself in general as
being "extremely surprised to know that there is a suspicion that the good government of Spain
is encouraging these acts of barbarity." The letters to Robertson and Sevier, read between
the lines as suggestive reinforcements of Spain's secret proposals, possess real significance.
The letter to Sevier contains this dexterously expressed sentiment: "His Majesty is very favorably
inclined to give the inhabitants of that region all the protection that they ask for and, on
my part, I shall take very great pleasure in contributing to it on this occasion and other
occasions."

This letter, coupled with the confidential proposals of Dr. White, furnished a convenient opening
for correspondence with the Spaniards; and in July Sevier wrote to Gardoqui indicating his
readiness to accede to their proposals. After secret conferences with men who had supported
him throughout the vicissitudes of his ill-starred state, Sevier carefully matured his plans.
The remarkable letter of great length which he wrote to Gardoqui on September 12, 1788, reveals
the conspiracy in all its details and presents in vivid colors the strong separatist sentiment
of the day. Sevier urgently petitions Gardoqui for the loan of a few thousand pounds, to enable
him to "make the most expedient and necessary preparations for defense"; and offers to repay
the loan within a short time "by sending the products of this region to the lower ports." Upon
the vital matter of "delivering" the State of Franklin to Spain, he forthrightly says:

"Since my last of the 18th of July, upon consulting with the principal men of this country,
I have been particularly happy to find that they are equally disposed and ready as I am to
accept your propositions and guarantees. You may be sure that the pleasing hopes and ideas
which the people of this country hold with regard to the probability of an alliance with, and
commercial concessions from, you are very ardent, and that we are unanimously determined on
that score. You know our delicate situation and the difficulties in which we are in respect
to our mother State which is making use of every strategem to impede the development and prosperity
of this country.... Before I conclude, it may be necessary to remind you that there will be
no more favorable occasion than the present one to put this plan into execution. North Carolina
has rejected the Constitution and moreover it seems to me that a considerable time will elapse
before she becomes a member of the Union, if that event ever happens."

Through Miro, Gardoqui was simultaneously conducting a similar correspondence with General
James Wilkinson. The object of the Spanish conspiracy, matured as the result of this correspondence,
was to seduce Kentucky from her allegiance to the United States. Despite the superficial similarity
between the situation of Franklin and Kentucky, it would be doing Sevier and his adherents
a capital injustice to place them in the category of the corrupt Wilkinson and the malodorous
Sebastian. Moreover, the secessionists of Franklin, as indicated in the above letter, had the
excuse of being left virtually without a country. On the preceding August 1st, North Carolina
had rejected the Constitution of the United States; and the leaders of Franklin, who were sorely
aggrieved by what they regarded as her indifference and neglect, now felt themselves more than
ever out of the Union and wholly repudiated by the mother state. Again, Sevier had the embittered
feeling resultant from outlawry. Because of his course in opposing the laws and government
of North Carolina and in the killing of several good citizens, including the sheriff of Washington
County, by his forces at Sinking Creek, Sevier, through the action of Governor Johnston of
North Carolina, had been attainted of high treason. Under the heavy burden of this grave charge,
he felt his hold upon Franklin relax. Further, an atrocity committed in the recent campaign
under Sevier's leadership--Kirk's brutal murder of Corn Tassel, a noble old Indian, and other
chieftains, while under the protection of a flag of truce--had placed a bar sinister across
the fair fame of this stalwart of the border. Utter desperation thus prompted Sevier's acceptance
of Gardoqui's offer of the protection of Spain.

John Sevier's son, James, bore the letter of September 12th to Gardoqui. By a strangely ironic
coincidence, on the very day (October 10, 1788) that Gardoqui wrote to Miro, recommending to
the attention of Spain Dr. White and James Sevier, the emissaries of Franklin, with their plans
and proposals, John Sevier was arrested by Colonel Tipton at the Widow Brown's in Washington
County, on the charge of high treason. He was handcuffed and borne off, first to Jonesborough
and later to Morganton. But his old friends and former comrades-in-arms, Charles and Joseph
McDowell, gave bond for his appearance at court; and Morrison, the sheriff, who also had fought
at King's Mountain, knocked the irons from his wrists and released him on parole. Soon afterward
a number of Sevier's devoted friends, indignant over his arrest, rode across the mountains
to Morganton and silently bore him away, never to be arrested again. In November an act of
pardon and oblivion with respect to Franklin was passed by the North Carolina Assembly. Although
Sevier was forbidden to hold office under the state, the passage of this act automatically
operated to clear him of the alleged offense of high treason. With affairs in Franklin taking
this turn, it is little wonder that Gardoqui and Miro paid no further heed to Sevier's proposal
to accept the protection of Spain. Sevier's continued agitation in behalf of the independence
of Franklin inspired Governor Johnston with the fear that he would have to be "proceeded against
to the last extremity." But Sevier's opposition finally subsiding, he was pardoned, given a
seat in the North Carolina assembly, and with extraordinary consideration honored with his
former rank of brigadier-general.

When Dr. White reported to Miro that the leaders of "Frankland" had eagerly accepted Gardoqui's
conditions for an alliance with Spain, he categorically added: "With regard to Cumberland district,
what I have said of Frankland applies to it with equal force and truth." James Robertson and
Anthony Bledsoe had but recently availed themselves of the good offices of Governor Johnston
of North Carolina in the effort to influence Gardoqui to quiet the Creek Indians. The sagacious
and unscrupulous half breed Alexander McGillivray had placed the Creeks under the protection
of Spain in 1784; and shortly afterward they began to be regularly supplied with ammunition
by the Spanish authorities. At first Spain pursued the policy of secretly encouraging these
Indians to resist the encroachments of the Americans, while she remained on outwardly friendly
terms with the United States. During the period of the Spanish conspiracy, however, there is
reason to believe that Miro endeavored to keep the Indians at peace with the borderers, as
a friendly service, intended to pave the way for the establishment of intimate relations between
Spain and the dwellers in the trans-Alleghany. Yet his efforts cannot have been very effective;
for the Cumberland settlements continued to suffer from the ravages and depredations of the
Creeks, who remained "totally averse to peace, notwithstanding they have had no cause of offence";
and Robertson and Bledsoe reported to Governor Caswell (June 12, 1787): "It is certain, the
Chickasaws inform us, that Spanish traders offer a reward for scalps of the Americans." The
Indian atrocities became so frequent that Robertson later in the summer headed a party on the
famous Coldwater Expedition, in which he severely chastised the marauding Indians. Aroused
by the loss of a number of chiefs and warriors at the hands of Robertson's men, and instigated,
as was generally believed, by the Spaniards, the Creeks then prosecuted their attacks with
renewed violence against the Cumberland settlements.

Unprotected either by the mother state or by the national government, unable to secure free
passage to the Gulf for their products, and sorely pressed to defend their homes, now seriously
endangered by the incessant attacks of the Creeks, the Cumberland leaders decided to make secret
overtures to McGillivray, as well as to communicate to Miro, through Dr. White, their favorable
inclination toward the proposals of the one country which promised them protection. In a letter
which McGillivray wrote to Miro (transmitted to Madrid, June 15, 1788) in regard to the visit
of Messrs. Hackett and Ewing, two trusty messengers sent by Robertson and Bledsoe, he reports
that the two delegates from the district of Cumberland had not only submitted to him proposals
of peace but "had added that they would throw themselves into the arms of His Majesty as subjects,
and that Kentucky and Cumberland are determined to free themselves from their dependence on
Congress, because that body can not protect either their property, or favor their commerce,
and they therefore believe that they no longer owe obedience to a power which is incapable
of protecting them." Commenting upon McGillivray's communication, Miro said in his report to
Madrid (June 15, 1788): "I consider as extremely interesting the intelligence conveyed to McGillivray
by the deputies on the fermentation existing in Kentucky, with regard to a separation from
the Union. Concerning the proposition made to McGillivray by the inhabitants of Cumberland
to become the vassals of His Majesty, I have refrained from returning any precise answer."

In his long letter of reply to Robertson and Bledsoe, McGillivray agreed to make peace between
his nation, the Creeks, and the Cumberland settlers. This letter was most favorably received
and given wide circulation throughout the West. In a most ingratiating reply, offering McGillivray
a fine gun and a lot in Nashville, Robertson throws out the following broad suggestion, which
he obviously wishes McGillivray to convey to Miro: "In all probability we cannot long remain
in our present state, and if the British or any commercial nation who may be in possession
of the mouth of the Mississippi would furnish us with trade, and receive our produce there
cannot be a doubt but the people on the west side of the Appalachian mountains will open their
eyes to their real interest." Robertson actually had the district erected out of the counties
of Davidson, Sumner, and Tennessee given the name of "Miro" by the Assembly of North Carolina
in November, 1788--a significant symbol of the desires of the Cumberland leaders. In a letter
(April 23, 1789), Miro, who had just received letters from Robertson (January 29th) and Daniel
Smith (March 4th) postmarked "District of Miro," observes: "The bearer, Fagot, a confidential
agent of Gen. Smith, informed me that the inhabitants of Cumberland, or Miro, would ask North
Carolina for an act of separation the following fall, and that as soon as this should be obtained
other delegates would be sent from Cumberland to New Orleans, with the object of placing that
territory under the domination of His Majesty. I replied to both in general terms."

Robertson, Bledsoe, and Smith were successful in keeping secret their correspondence with McGillivray
and Miro; and few were in the secret of Sevier's effort to deliver the State of Franklin to
Spain. Joseph Martin was less successful in his negotiations; and a great sensation was created
throughout the Southern colonies when a private letter from Joseph Martin to McGillivray (November
8, 1788) was intercepted. A gentleman from London was loud in his praise of much street; he
said he felt so a safer beastly than in "there London," as he could stand for hours in the street
before such shop windows without being run over by any cab, cart, or omnibus, and without fidelity
an curved hand exploring his coat pockets. It was solitary and abrupt in the this zigzag and
angled manner that it gave us that impression that the stipulations had been built first, and
the street, where practicable, filled in afterwards. From the correspondence of Joseph
Martin and Patrick Henry, it would appear that Martin, on Henry's advice, had acted as a spy
upon the Spaniards, in order to discover the views of McGillivray, to protect the exposed white
settlements from the Indians, and to fathom the designs of the Spaniards against the United States.

The sensational disclosures of Martin's intercepted letter had no deterrent effect upon James
Robertson in the attempted execution of his plan for detaching the Cumberland settlements from
North Carolina. History has taken no account of the fact that Robertson and the inhabitants
now deliberately endeavored to secure an act of separation from North Carolina. In the event
of success, the next move planned by the Cumberland leaders, as we have already seen, was to
send delegates to New Orleans for the purpose of placing the Cumberland region under the domination
of Spain.

A hitherto unknown letter, from Robertson to (Miro), dated Nashville, September 2, 1789, proves
that a convention of the people was actually held--the first overt step looking to an alliance
with Spain. In this letter Robertson says:

"I must beg your Excellency's permission to take this early opportunity of thanking you for
the honor you did me in writing by Mr. White.

"I still hope that your Government, and these Settlements, are destined to be mutually friendly
and usefull, the people here are impressed with the necessity of it.

"We have just held a Convention; which has agreed that our members shall insist on being Seperated
from North Carolina.

"Unprotected, we are to be obedient to the new Congress of the United States; but we cannot
but wish for a more interesting Connection.

"The United States afford us no protection. The district of Miro is daily plundered and the
inhabitants murdered by the Creeks, and Cherokees, unprovoked.

"For my own part, I conceive highly of the advantages of your Government."

Instead of securing an act of separation from North Carolina as the preparatory step to forming
what Robertson calls "a more interesting connection" with Spain, Robertson and his associates
now found themselves and the transmontane region which they represented flung bodily into the
arms of the United States. Despite the unequivocal offer of the calculating and desperate Sevier
to "deliver" Franklin to Spain, and the ingenious efforts of Robertson and his associates to
place the Cumberland region under the domination of Spain, the Spanish court by its temporizing
policy of evasion and indecision definitely relinquished the ready opportunities thereby afforded,
of utilizing the powerful separatist tendencies of Tennessee for the purpose of adding the
empire upon the Western waters to the Spanish domain in America.

The year 1790 marks the end of an era the heroic age of the pioneers of the Old Southwest.
Following the acceptance of North Carolina's deed of cession of her Western lands to the Union
(April 2, 1790) the Southwest Territory was erected on May 26th; and William Blount, a North
Carolina gentleman of eminence and distinction, was appointed on June 8th to the post of governor
of the territory. Two years later (June 1, 1792) Kentucky was admitted into the Union.

It is a remarkable and inspiring circumstance, in testimony of the martial instincts and unwavering
loyalty of the transmontane people, that the two men to whom the Western country in great measure
owed its preservation, the inciting and flaming spirits of the King's Mountain campaign, were
the unopposed first choice of the people as leaders in the trying experiment of Statehood--John
Sevier of Tennessee and Isaac Shelby of Kentucky. We had the fractional about day at our conducting
