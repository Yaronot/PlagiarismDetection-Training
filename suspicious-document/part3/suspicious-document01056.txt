PREFACE.

The reader has a right to ask what qualification the writer may have for dealing with the subject
upon which he offers his opinions.

The author of this book claims the qualifications of an observer who, during many years, has
studied the ways and thoughts of the Natives of South Africa on the spot, not through interpreters,
but at first hand, through the medium of their own speech, which he professes to know as well
as the Natives themselves.

THE BLACK MAN'S PLACE IN SOUTH AFRICA.

THE QUESTION STATED.

The white man has taken up the burden of ruling his dark-skinned fellows throughout the world,
and in South Africa he has so far carried that burden alone, feeling well assured of his fitness
for the task. He has seen before him a feeble folk, strong only in their numbers and fit only
for service, a people unworthy of sharing with his own race the privileges of social and political
life, and it has seemed right therefore in his sight that this people should continue to bend
under his dominant will. But to-day the white man is being disturbed by signs of coming strength
among the black and thriving masses; signs of the awakening of a consciousness of racial manhood
that is beginning to find voice in a demand for those rights of citizenship which hitherto
have been so easily withheld. The white people are beginning to ask themselves whether they
shall sit still and wait till that voice becomes clamant and insistent throughout the land
or whether they shall begin now to think out and provide means for dealing with those coming
events whose shadows are already falling athwart the immediate outlook. The strong and solid
feeling among the whites in the past against giving any political rights to the blacks however
civilised they might be is not so strong or as solid as it was. The number is growing of those
among the ruling race who feel that the right of representation should here also follow the
burden of taxation, but while there are many who think thus, those who try to think the matter
out in all its bearings soon come to apprehend the possibility that where once political equality
has been granted social equality may follow, and this apprehension makes the thinking man pause
to think again before he commits himself to a definite and settled opinion.

Taking the civilisation of to-day to mean an ordered and advanced state of society in which
all men are equally bound and entitled to share the burdens and privileges of the whole political
and social life according to their individual limitations we ask whether the African Natives
are capable of acquiring this civilisation, and whether, if it be proved that their capacity
for progress is equal to that of the Europeans, the demand for full racial equality that must
inevitably follow can in fairness be denied. This I take to be the crux of the Native Question
in South Africa.

Before we attempt to answer this question it is necessary to find out, if we can, in what ways
the African differs from the European; for if it be found that there are radical and inherent
differences between the two races of a kind that seem certain to remain unaltered by new influences
and changed environment then the whites will feel justified in denying equality where nature
herself has made it impossible, whereas if the existing difference be proved to be only outwardly
acquired and not inwardly heritable then the coming demand for equality will stand supported
by natural right which may not be ignored. The question, then, before us is this. Is the African
Native equal to the European in mental and moral capacity or is he not? We must have an answer
to this question, for we cannot assign to the Native his proper place in the general scheme
of our civilisation till we know exactly what manner of man he is.

We of to-day are rightly proud of our freedom from the sour superstitions and religious animosities
of the past, but these hindrances to progress and general happiness were only dispelled by
the light of scientific thought and clear reasoning. Let us then bring to bear that same blessed
light upon our present enquiry into the reasons, real or fancied, for those prejudices of race
and colour which we still retain, for it is only by removing the misconceptions and false notions
that obscure our view that we can come to a clear understanding of the many complex issues
that make up the great Native problem of Africa.

BODILY DIFFERENCES.

"That which distinguishes man from the beast," said Beaumarchais, "is drinking without being
thirsty, and making love at all seasons," and he spoke perhaps truer than he knew, for the
fact that man is not bound by seasons and is not in entire subjection to his environment is
the cardinal distinction between him and the brutes. This distinction was won through man's
possession of a thinking brain which caused or coincided with an upright carriage whereby his
two hands were set free from the lowly service of mere locomotion to make fire and to fashion
the tools wherewith he was enabled to control his environment instead of remaining like the
animals entirely controlled by it. This wonderful brain also made possible the communication
and tradition of his experiences and ideas through articulate speech by which means his successors
in each generation were able to keep and develop the slowly spelt lessons of human life.

Are the African Natives as far removed from the beasts as the Europeans, and do they share
equally with the Europeans this great human distinction of ability to think?

The belief, at, one time commonly held, that in morphological development and physical appearance
the Bantu stand nearer in the scale of evolution to our common ape-like ancestors than do the
white people does not seem to be warranted by facts. Careful investigations by trained observers
all over the world have shown that the various simian features discernible in the anatomy of
modern man are found fairly evenly distributed amongst advanced and backward races.

The so-called prognathism of the Bantu has been cited as a racial mark denoting comparative
nearness to the brutes, but when it is noted that anthropologists differ among themselves as
to what constitutes this feature, whether it is to be measured from points above or below the
nose or both, and when we are informed in some text books that while the negroes are prognathous,
bushmen must be classed with Europeans as being the opposite, that is, orthognathous,[1] and
when, added to this, we learn from other quarters that white women are, on the average, more
prognathous than white men,[2] then the significance of this distinction, which in any case
is not regarded as being relative to cranical capacity, is seen to be more apparent than real.

Extreme hairiness of body, on the other hand, which might well be taken as a simian or vestigial
character, is seldom met with in the Bantu, but is equally common among Europeans and Australian
aboriginals and is found particularly developed in the Ainu of Japan. The texture also of the
African's hair is less like that of the hair of the man-like apes than is the hair of the European.
The proportions of the limbs of the Europeans seem, on the average, to be nearer to the supposed
prototype of man than those of the Bantu. The specifically human development of the red lips
is more pronounced in the African than in the European,[3] and if there is anything in what
has been called the "god-like erectness of the human carriage" then it must be admitted that
the Bantu women exhibit a straightness of form which may well be envied by the ladies of civilisation.

It is generally accepted that the African Natives have a bodily odour of their own which is
sui generis in that it is supposed to be different from that of other human races. Some early
travellers have compared it with the smell of the female crocodile, and many people believe
it to be a racial characteristic denoting a comparatively humble origin and intended by nature
as a signal or warning for the rest of human kind against close physical contact with the African
race. A recent student of the Negro question in America gives it as his opinion that this odour
is "something which the Negroes will have difficulty in living down."[4] To most Europeans
this smell seems to be more or less unpleasant but it must not be forgotten that it does not
seem to affect the large numbers of white men of all nationalities who have found and still
find pleasure in continued and intimate intercourse with African women. It would seem as if
highly "refined" Europeans are nowadays given to exaggerate the sensation produced on their
over delicate olfactory nerves by the exhalations caused by perspiration through a healthy
and porous skin. In many of the so-called Ladies' Journals published in England and America
advertisements appear regularly vaunting chemical preparations for the disguising of the odour
of perspiration which, it is alleged, mars the attractiveness of women. Attribute. It was the confusedness,

 He could see no proof of continuously increasing intellectual
power; he thought that where the greatest advance in intellect is supposed to have been made
this might be wholly due to the cumulative effect of successive acquisitions of knowledge handed
down from age to age by written or printed books; that Euclid and Archimedes were probably
the equals of any of our greatest mathematicians of to-day; and that we are entitled to believe
that the higher intellectual and moral nature of man has been approximately stationary during
the whole period of human history. This great and intrepid thinker states his view with characteristic
incisiveness thus: "Many writers thoughtlessly speak of the hereditary effects of strength
or skill due to any mechanical work or special art being continued generation after generation
in the same family, as amongst the castes of India. But of any progressive improvement there
is no evidence whatever. Those children who had a natural aptitude for the work would, of course,
form the successors of their parents, and there is no proof of anything hereditary except as
regards this innate aptitude. Many people are alarmed at the statement that the effects of
education and training are not hereditary, and think that if that were really the case there
would be no hope for improvement of the race; but close consideration will show them that if
the results of our education in the widest sense, in the home, in the shop, in the nation,
and in the world at large, had really been hereditary, even in the slightest degree, then indeed
there would be little hope for humanity, and there is no clearer proof of this than the fact
that we have not all been made much worse--the wonder being that any fragment of morality,
or humanity, or the love of truth or justice for their own sakes still exists among us."[15]

I think the majority of thoughtful people will agree that these words express their own observations.
Every day we see how children have to be taught to act and behave. We see continually how parents
have to put pressure on their children to make them accept and apply those moral principles
and mental valuations which have guided their lives and the lives of thousands of generations
before them. We know only too well that children do not inherit the moral standards of right
and wrong of their parents, and that to establish these principles in the young is a matter
of protracted and often painful inculcation. The proved maxim that honesty is the best policy
is still being literally hammered into the children of to-day who seem to find it no easier
to follow the better way than did the children of the past. If mental modifications acquired
by the parents were in any degree transmissible to the offspring then there would be no need
for this constant repetition of the same process in every new generation.

The earliest indubitable man hitherto discovered was fully evolved when first met with, he
was homo sapiens. By means of his human intelligence this frail, unspecialized being became
in a sense the very lord of creation, for instead of remaining, like the animals, entirely
subject to his surroundings he subjected his surroundings to himself. By means of this intelligence
man was enabled to break away from the absolute rule of the law of natural selection which
punishes with extinction all those types that fail in fitness for survival in the struggle
for existence, so that, unlike the animals that die out when their particular structure does
not fit in with their environment, man by means of his thinking brain was able to equip himself
with parts of his environment, and thus to become its master. The process of evolution ceased
to affect directly this creature who had a brain that could think, and ever since that brain
was given to him man has remained unmoved and stationary above and apart from all other living
things. All this is implied in the command, "Be ye fruitful and multiply and replenish the
earth and subdue it."

But though man became almost emancipated from the direct servitude of natural selection, he
still is, and always will be, subject to the law of heredity. Man is made up of a group of
innate characters inherited from a very mixed ancestry, these characters, being innate, are
transmissible to his offspring, but such characters as are acquired by the parent through the
direct influence of education or other environment, not being innate are not transmissible
to his children. But in so far as a new development of latent and innate characters, through
the influence of the environment, may help or hinder certain types in propagating themselves,
the race may, perhaps, be modified through such influence by the process of gradual elimination
of the types that lack the characters that prove to be of survival value in a particular locality.
This we may suppose might happen where a number of Europeans, composed half of blondes and
half of brunettes, come to live in a tropical country, if it be proved that the comparative
darkness of the brunettes afford them better protection against inimical light and heat than
the fair skin of the blondes, so that the former would on the average, enjoy better health
and live longer, and therefore have more children than the latter, whereby, in course of time,
the appearance of these people would be modified in respect of the general complexion of their
skin. This, it is easy to see, would not mean the acquisition of a new and heritable means
of protection, but only a development in each individual of an already present innate character
that happened to be well fitted for survival in a certain climatic zone.

In order, therefore, to obtain any direct modification of the race in the way of mental improvement
the physical effect of education must be such as to ensure longer life and with it, the concomitant
chance of greater fertility for those who are educated against those who are not, so that the
latter would tend to die out while the former would continue to increase their numbers. In
other words, education must prove to be of survival value. Seeing that where education has
increased most the birth-rate has tended to decrease it seems clear that we cannot regard continuous
mental training as a favourable factor in the competition of propagation of human varieties.

If then we accept the conclusion that the effects of individual experience are not cumulatively
hereditary we shall cease to cavil at the fact that there has been no anatomical or structural
progress in the human body or brain since the time when men first became social and civilised
beings, that is to say, since they first began to work together with their heads and hands,
and we shall see that that which was to be expected has always happened, in that, from the
earliest historical times to the present day, human life has been as the rolling and unrolling
of a carpet. Cycles of civilisations, all essentially similar, have been evolved, one after
another, to endure for a while and then to fade away, leaving the raw material of human kind
as it was from the beginning. There is no evidence of any advancement in physique, intellect
or moral character. The leaders of mankind were the law-givers, whether they were witch doctors,
priests, chiefs, prophets or kings, and they all sought to establish their laws by claiming
supernatural delegation and authority. With writing came the codes, and when we compare the
statutes of Hammurabi, who flourished about 2,200 years B.C., with those compiled by his successors,
Moses, Solon, Justinian and Napoleon, we find in them all evidence of the same mental appreciation
and capacity in dealing with the social conditions and problems of their respective periods.
The greatest products of art are still met with in the sculptured forms of ancient Greece,
those images of serene beauty which may be imitated but not excelled. The reasoning powers
of the ancient philosophers who, long before Christ was born, debated the still unanswered
riddles of existence, when we compare the paucity of data on which they had to work with the
wealth of knowledge now available, must be ranked as high as the intellectual ability of our
foremost thinkers of to-day. In mechanical proficiency the world has indeed advanced to an
astonishing extent, but the perfection of our modern machinery means only a gradual and very
recent advance upon earlier methods and does not denote a corresponding development in the
mind itself. The Greeks had no machinery to speak of, neither had the English in the days of
Shakespeare and Newton, but who can doubt that the engineers of those times would have been
equal to the task of understanding and applying the principles of modern mechanics had the
necessary books been available to them? We do not assume that because the modern Germans excel
as chemists they are therefore blessed with higher reasoning ability than were the contemporaries
of Socrates and Plato who had no knowledge of the science of chemistry. The conclusion forced
upon us after a sober and impartial survey of the facts of history is that, although the intellectual
output of the world is always increasing, the intellect itself remains unaltered. Knowledge,
we see, is after all, only descriptive, never fundamental. We can describe the appearance and
condition of a process, but not the way of it, and though knowledge has come in rich abundance,
wisdom still lingers.

The foregoing argument shows that the alleged mental superiority of the European cannot be
due to constant use or education, so that it now becomes necessary for those who maintain that
it nevertheless exists to prove, not only that the white man's intellectual capacity is now
superior but to prove also that from the beginning it has always been stronger and better than
that of the African Native, or, in other words, those who believe that the white race has inherent
mental superiority must prove innate inferiority in the mental make-up of the Native.

There is a more or less indefinite notion abroad that the Bantu languages, as compared with
those of Europe, are but poor and ineffective vehicles for the conveyance of abstract ideas,
wherefore the capacity to form and entertain such ideas may be taken to be innately inferior
in the Native brain. That the language of a people embodies, so to speak, in objective form
the intellectual progress made by it is certainly true, and it will be well, therefore, to
state briefly the actual and potential value of the Native speech as compared with that of
the whites.

The living and the dead languages of the world have been classified by philologists into three
main types of linguistic morphology; the isolating, like Chinese; the agglutinative, like Turkish
and Bantu, and the inflective, like Latin. It was customary not long ago to look upon these
three types as steps in a process of historical development, the isolating representing the
most primitive form of speech at which it was possible to arrive, the agglutinative coming
next in order as a type evolved from the isolating, and the inflective as the latest and so-called
highest type of all. But since the matter has been carefully studied it has been admitted that
there is no satisfactory evidence for believing in any evolution of linguistic types. English
is now considered to be an isolating language in the making while Chinese is cited by authoritative
European scholars as being a language which with the simplest possible means at its disposal
can express the most technical or philosophical ideas with absolute freedom from ambiguity
and with admirable conciseness and direction.[16]

While I do not pretend to philological authority I do claim the ability to make a sound comparison
between the main Bantu languages which I know and those European languages with which I happen
to be familiar, and I have no hesitation in saying that though the Bantu types are not at present
as fully developed in point of simplicity and preciseness as are the main languages of Europe
they are, nevertheless, by reason of their peculiar genius, capable of being rapidly developed
into as perfect a means for the expression of human thought as any of the European types of
speech; they are astonishingly rich in verbs which make it easy to express motion and action
clearly and vividly; the impersonal, or abstract article "it" is used exactly as in European
languages, and the particular prefix provided in some of the Bantu types for the class of nouns
which represent abstract conceptions makes it possible to increase the vocabularies in that
direction ad infinitum. The Bantu types are not so-called holophrastic forms of primitive speech
in which the compounding of expressions is said to take the place of the conveyance of ideas,
nor are they made up of onomatopoetic, or interjectional expressions, if indeed such languages
exist anywhere outside the heads of the half-informed. They are languages equal in potential
capacity to any included in the main Indo-European group. Even now in their comparatively undeveloped
state these languages are capable of expressing the subtleties of early philosophical speculation.
I would not, for instance, feel daunted if I were set the task of translating into any of these
main types, say, the dialectics of Socrates. To do this I would first reduce the more complex
terms to such simple and common Anglo-Saxon words as when built together would give the same
meaning, and then translate these into their Bantu equivalents. The substitution of Anglo-Saxon
words for those of modern English would, no doubt, involve a good deal of repetition but the
sense would be adequately rendered. I would proceed in the same way as the early teachers and
writers who had to build up the language they used as they went along. The English indeed,
have not built up their world-wide speech with their own materials but have, with characteristic
acquisitiveness taken the combinations they wanted, ready made, mainly from Greek, Latin and
French. How far and how well a Native would understand my presentation of metaphysical speculation
would depend upon the degree of familiarity he might have acquired, through Missionary teaching
or otherwise, with abstract notions in general. In my opinion the average "raw" Native would
understand as well and as much as the average uneducated European peasant. Both would probably
find my disquisition "sad stuff"; both would require time for that repetition of the words
which is necessary to familiarise the mind with the unaccustomed ideas they represent; in both
cases one would have to "give them the words that the ideas may come." A single illustration
will show my meaning. When the first Missionaries rendered the word "soul" into Zulu by the
word signifying "breath" in that language they simply followed the example of their predecessors
of antiquity who employed the Latin spiritus, which also means "breath," for the same purpose,
namely, to convey to their hearers the idea of a breath-like or ethereal something housed in,
but separable from, the human body.

"The essence of language," said Aristotle, "is that it should be clear and not mean." The raw
Bantu material is ample for compliance with this demand, and the process of development will
not be as protracted as in early Europe for it may be accomplished here, largely, by the simple
means of translating the words already thought out and provided in the white man's language.
In so far, then, as we attempt to measure the mentality of the Natives by their language we
find that they cannot be relegated to a lower plane than that occupied by the uneducated peasantry
of Europe of a few decades ago.

Most people are prepared to believe that the primary psychical processes are identical in all
races, but many still profess to see a difference in favour of the white man in what they call
the higher faculties of the mind. But the much-abused word "faculty" no longer bears the meaning
given to it by Locke and his followers who propounded a limitless brood or set of faculties
to correspond with every process discoverable by introspection as taking place in the mind.
In modern psychology the word means simply a capacity for an ultimate, irreducible, or unanalysable
mode of thinking of, or being conscious of, objects. Perception, for instance, is looked upon
as the capacity for thinking of a thing immediately at hand, and memory as a capacity for thinking
again of a certain material or abstract object. The mental power of abstraction is no longer
considered as a sort of separate function of the mind but is regarded as the capacity for thinking
of, say, whiteness as apart from any particular white patch. But the notion that the white
man is endowed with a set of finer feelings and with special and higher powers of abstraction
than is the African Native is so generally entertained that it will be convenient to make the
necessary comparisons in, more or less, the commonly accepted terms.

Those who look upon the Native as being in every way a more primitive being than the European
will naturally be disposed to believe that he is more a creature of instincts than a man of
reason, and they will expect him to move in dependence upon certain fundamental intuitions
where the European goes guided by reason alone. I have found no evidence whatever to support
this supposition.

The elementry instinct of self-preservation is no stronger in the Native than in the white
man. Suicide is not at all uncommon among the Bantu. I have seen many instances of Natives
who have shown a calm and philosophical disregard of death where life has seemed no longer
desirable. This pre-eminently human prerogative--for no animal can rise to the conscious and
deliberate destruction of itself--has often been exercised, as I have seen, by Natives in their
sound and sober senses so as to preclude entirely that suggestion of temporary insanity which
is so commonly accepted at coroner's inquests in England and elsewhere.

The instinct of direction, the "bump of locality" as it is generally called, varies with the
Natives as it does among the whites, and is no keener in the individual Native than in the
individual white man. All the hunters and travellers I have met have confirmed the opinion
I have myself formed from personal experience that by training his ordinary powers of observation
and thereby developing his sense of locality and direction the average European is able, after
a comparatively short time, to find his way in difficult country as well as the Natives, while
some European hunters who have dispensed with Native guides and trackers have acquired the
art of tracking game so well that they surpass even the local Natives themselves. "Veld-craft"
is simply a matter of training the ordinary faculties of observation and memory for particular
purposes, and the Native shows no such superiority in this respect as would naturally be expected
from him if he were indeed better provided with animal instincts than the more civilised white man.

The sexual instincts of the Natives seem in no wise different from those of other people. The
African male, like the European male, is generally more amative than the female who is always
more philoprogenitive than the man. But the notion is common that the Native male is more bestial
when sexually excited than the white man in similar case, and this is taken to account for
the fact that he is so often found guilty of crimes of violence against females of his own
colour, and sometimes even against European women.

It must be borne in mind that before the white man came the Natives, like the peasants in many
European countries not long ago, conducted their courtship and love-making with a show of violence
which seemed to them right and proper. The idea, indeed, that any self-respecting Native girl
could yield herself to a lover without, at least, a semblance of physical resistance, leading
to her more or less forcible capture by the man, would have seemed, and still seems, distinctly
improper to the majority of Native women in their raw state. But since the European code was
set up Native women have not been slow in making use of its protection, and, as I have seen,
have not infrequently abused that protection by alleging rape or assault where their own action
in simulating flight and resistance served, as they well knew it would, to stimulate passion
and pursuit.

In considering crimes of violence against white women it must also be remembered that the Native
"house-boy" who works in constant and close physical contact with his European mistress and
her daughters is exposed to sexual excitation which very few European youths are called upon
to withstand. But crimes of this kind are indeed common enough among the lower orders in Europe
and America, and are particularly frequent among men who have to live for a long time in unnatural
abstinence from natural intercourse with the opposite sex, and who then find themselves in
new surroundings giving opportunities for the gratification of their natural desires, but without
having at the same time the restraining influences of their home life to help them to overcome
the temptations to which they are exposed. The seaports of Europe and America, and the Great
War furnish too many sad examples of sexual ferocity by white men to allow us to think that
they are in this respect inherently superior to the men of other races.

The maternal instinct is manifested in the same manner and degree in the women of both people.
I have often asked Native women whether it would be possible for any mother among them to distinguish
her own new-born baby from a supposed "changeling" of the same sex and of the same general
appearance, and the answer has always been negative. The Native and the white woman alike would
continue to cherish the substituted child exactly as they would have cherished the issue of
their own bodies. The desire to bear children is the same in all normally constituted women
irrespective of colour or race, and there is no sign of any special instinct for identification
in the Native woman, such as the sense of smell, which is found in all the higher animals.

There are some students who think that most of the emotions of man are but the survivals of
instinctive habit. Be this as it may, the sexual attraction which is commonly called love certainly
seems to be essentially instinctive whereas friendship and parental and filial devotion, when
continued throughout life, seem to be emotions that depend largely upon association and conscious
intelligence. Every natural mother will sacrifice herself for her offspring while it is young
but the tender feeling which continues in her breast towards the child after it has grown up
is sustained by association, or, where the child is continually absent, by conscious intelligence
in the form of considerations of conventional approbation which in time merge into a habit
or a sense of duty which is hardly recognised as such. Many white people think that although
the average Native mother is capable of the greatest devotion for her young children she is
incapable of the love which a white mother feels for her children even after they have ceased
to depend upon her care. This, I think, is wrong. I have seen many instances of elderly Native
women who have cherished their grown up children to the last with every sign of motherly affection.

Joy and sorrow, love and hatred, hope and fear, these are the fundamental emotions of human
kind. Can any difference be detected between these feelings in the two races?

No one who knows him will say that the Native's capacity for the "joy of life unquestioned"
is less than that of the average white man. Most Natives are born lovers of song and music,
and attain easily to technical proficiency in the art of harmony. The æsthetic sense is present
in the average Native as it is in the average European and in both is easily overlooked when
not stimulated and developed by education and culture. That the Natives, as a whole, feel the
sorrows of life and death as keenly as do the people of other races will be readily admitted
by all who know them well, although their way of showing their sorrow may differ from those
prescribed by the canons of conduct of other communities. It is assumed by many that love,
"the grand passion," has been brought to a finer point, as it were, among the white people
than anywhere else, and it may well be that monogamy is conducive to the growth of a higher
and purer form of sexual reciprocity than is possible under the polygamous system of the Natives
and other peoples. The monogamous marriage, though based on sexual attraction in the first
instance, tends to become, as the man and the woman grow older, a union of souls, so to speak,
more or less independent of the sexual element itself. The close and continued association
of one man and one woman of compatible temperaments no doubt brings about a state of mutual
intimacy, dependence and devotion which can hardly be possible in a polygamous household. But
on the other hand may fairly be cited the frequent instances, familiar to all, of widows and
widowers among Europeans who, despite their repeated and quite honest protestations of undying
and undivided love for the first "one and only" mate, nevertheless find speedy consolation
in a second marriage in which undying and whole-hearted love for the second "one and only"
spouse is again declared and accepted in all sincerity. The phenomenon of "falling in love,"
as it is commonly called, is not peculiar to white people. I have known many cases where the
love-sick Native swain has travelled hundreds of miles and suffered great hardships in order
to reach or recover the one woman of his choice though other women, no less desirable, were
ready to be had for the asking at his home. The converse is even more commonly seen. Native
women are remarkably like white women. They look upon marriage as their proper and natural
function in life, but they are not all of them willing to marry according to parental instructions;
there is the same proportion of self-willed damsels among them as among the whites, who by
obdurately refusing to enter into the marriages arranged for them cause pain and trouble to
their well-meaning parents.

Jealousy, especially from the female side, is an ever-present source of trouble and unhappiness
among the Natives. The length to which a jealous Native wife will go in winning back the affections
of an errant husband is often extraordinary, though the ways and means she adopts differ but
little from those practised by the superstitious and credulous peasantry in Europe less than
a hundred years ago.

While no one will deny the African Native a capacity for feeling anger equal to that of the
white man when provoked by insult and injury there are many who believe that he is constitutionally
incapable of sustaining that feeling of hatred which in the European so often leads to premeditated
and prepared revenge. This notion is, no doubt, derivable from the fact that a Native seldom
shows any open vindictiveness against a European employer by whom he has been insulted or unjustly
punished, but this fact may, I think, be otherwise accounted for. The white man's prestige,
backed up as it is by the established powers of law and order, makes the attempt at revenge
by a Native a difficult and risky undertaking and, furthermore, there is to be considered the
spirit of traditional submissiveness which at all times and in all places marks the attitude
of the slave or serf towards his master. One has only to remember the many accounts of abject
resignation by the peasants of France and the moujiks of Russia before the revolutions that
changed the order of the past in those countries. No such considerations affect the Native
where his anger and hatred are directed against one or more of his own colour. The records
of the South African courts are replete with instances of cattle-maiming, arson, poisoning
and other crimes proved to have been motived solely by feelings of revenge.

Courage and fear are feelings that depend upon conditions that seem to be fairly evenly distributed
all over the world, and where the virtue of courage in the form of pugnacity is comparatively
lacking, as amongst the bulk of the population of India, other forms thereof are met with,
such as that wonderful contempt of a painful death by burning which was so often displayed
by the widows of that country in following their ancient custom of suttee. The average white
man feels assured that no race can be compared in bravery with his own, and that within that
race no nation can be found equal in courage to the one to which he belongs. This is a form
of elemental patriotism common to all communities, but those who have shared the dangers of
flood and field with African Natives often testify to acts of sublime courage by Native soldiers,
hunters and miners in the face of real and appreciated danger under circumstances which show
that the Natives as a whole are no less capable than the white people of conquering instinctive
fear and of sacrificing the individual self when great demands are made. I am not speaking
now of what is commonly called mob-courage. Natives have been known to go through fire and
water alone as well as white men.

Is there any difference of kind or degree in the moral sense of the two races? In the prevailing
view of authoritative students morality is emotional and not intellectual in its origin, and
the warrant of right doing is attributed not to some hypothetical objective standard, but to
the whisperings of an inner conscience, an innate subjective mental state, independent of environment
and education. Differences, undoubtedly, exist as to the acts or omissions which are approved
or disapproved by the moral feeling in the two races respectively, but the feeling is the same.
The feelings which prompt a Native woman to condemn barrenness in other women is the same as
that which makes the average European lady look upon immodesty as a sign of immorality. The
difference is objective, not subjective; it is in the outlook but not in the inner sense. That
immorality is rife amongst Natives no one who knows them well will deny, but neither can putanism
amongst the whites be denied. Before the white man came the very robust moral sense of the
Natives made them put down theft and, sometimes, adultery, with a thoroughness which is apparently
impossible amongst the most civilised white people to-day. Now that Western civilisation is
spreading over the land the difference in the moral outlook of the two peoples tends to decrease;
with the savage vices go the savage virtues, and soon there will be no difference at all.

Having found no difference between the senses, instincts and inner feelings of the two races
we come now to consider the oft-alleged difference in what is popularly called pure intellect
in favour of the white man. Is there such a thing as pure intellect or pure rationality? Obviously
there is not. The thought that we call abstract is fashioned in the same way as the thought
that is formed by the recognition of similarities between concrete objects. The abstract thought
has its source like all other forms of thought in the organic and emotional structure of the
individual, and it is, indeed, only by pointing to instances that we can define what we mean
by an abstract idea. But many people still think that the white race is gifted with a special
faculty for thinking about general attributes as apart from the particular objects in which
the abstracted attributes may be concretely perceived. There is no foundation in fact for this
presumption. The Natives have no difficulty in finding words wherewith to abstract the general
essence from a plurality of facts or instances; their vocabulary is as apt and as extensive
for this purpose as that which suffices for the mental or spiritual needs of the bulk of European
people, indeed, the capacity for abstracting the general nature and character from the particular
experience or emotion into pithy expressions by way of simile or metaphor that admirably convey
the perceived generalisation is as highly evolved in the Native as in any other human variety.[17]

I think that the magistrates, native commissioners, police officers, missionaries, farmers,
miners, and traders in South Africa who have had first-hand experience of dealing with raw
Natives will agree with me that in sound reasoning ability, as applied to matters with which
he is familiar, the Native is no whit below the white man. It would be easy for me to give
hundreds of instances that have come under my own observation of arguments stated and deductions
made by Natives who were innocent of all European education that would show a capacity for
mental analysis and clear ratiocination equal to that of the educated European, but I have
to consider the reader's patience and will therefore confine myself to a few illustrations
taken at random from a number that were written down by me at the time of observation. I may
say here that my translation into English has been made with the most scrupulous regard to
exactness so as to avoid the possibility of importing into the words used a fuller meaning
than that which was actually present in the speaker's own mind.

In the Northern part of Matabeleland, not far from the Zambesi river, lives a tribe called
Bashankwe who follow a custom of marriage known locally as "ku garidzela" which is in effect
a rendering of personal service, in the doing of such primitive husbandry as there obtains
by the prospective son-in-law for the parent of the girl chosen instead of paying for her a
consideration in money or cattle as is done by most of the Natives in South Africa. It is a
practice similar to the custom which may be supposed to have been general in Palestine when
Jacob served for Rachel in the days of the Hebrew patriarchs. Sometime ago I discussed the
nature and present incidence of this custom with a chief named Sileya of those parts, a wholly
untutored Native. A point brought up for settlement was the validity, under the present régime,
of the claim for compensation that under their law might be brought by a rejected "garidzela"
lover for the value of the work done by him during his period of service when, at the end of
such service, he found the girl unwilling to marry him. I had explained to the chief that the
white man's government would always set its face against any custom whereby it might be possible
for the parents to pledge their daughters in marriage, and had pointed out that this particular
custom was for that reason not viewed with favour by the authorities. To this Sileya replied:
"If you, the Government, will make it plain that the man who finds himself refused by the girl
for whom he has been serving can claim compensation for the work he has done then the fathers
will become more careful than they now are and they will refuse to accept the young man's services
save where the girl is old enough to consent for herself, for no man likes to give up what
he has won and held, and in this manner our old custom will not go against the way of the Government."
This reply, which I have Englished almost literally, is typical of the Native form of argumentation
and it shows good all-round thinking ability; it is not a particular instance of special intelligence,
but a fair example of average Native perspicacity.

A few months ago, while discussing with some elderly Matabele Natives the subject of miscegenation
in South Africa generally one of the old men voiced the opinion of the meeting thus:

"White people do what they like, they take what they like, and when they like certain girls
they take them, and what can we say? And, after all, why should they not do so? Everything
belongs to them, we are their people, our girls belong to them, the white people only take
what is theirs to take."

"But," I interpolated, "white men do not take the girls away from you, it is the girls themselves
who leave their own kind and go to the white men."

"No," he replied, "I say they take the girls because they know as well as we do that women--all
women--will always go where they can live with ease and have plenty and be without work, and
this they can do when they go to the white man, whereas with us they must work. Therefore I
say that the white men take the girls away from us, but I do not say that they do wrong so
long as they only play with them and have no children by them, for it is the manner of all
the world that men and women come together and no law can be made to stop them from doing so,
but the white men do wrong when they allow the black women to have children by them because
such children grow up without proper homes, and that is very sad and wrong."

I think the average white man, whatever his own opinion may be on this matter, will acknowledge
that there is clear thought and strong common-sense in the old man's dictum, and this old man
is an ordinary raw Native, without any European education.

My good friend, Mahlabanyane, is a typical Tebele of the old school. In his youth he accompanied
the hunter Selous on many wanderings, and he never tires of telling of the ways and habits
of the game and wild animals he has seen and shot. One day he told me that he had observed
all the wild animals of Rhodesia, big and small, and that he had examined them all after they
had been killed. He had come to the conclusion, he said, that many of the bigger animals were
related to one another in some wonderful way, and that they had probably come out of the earth,
all alike, and had then afterwards become different, "as people do when they separate and live
always by themselves away from other people," he added.

"Look at the elephant, the rhinoceros, the hippopotamus and the wild pig," he said, "they must
at one time have been one kind; their teeth are alike, and none of them chew the cud. I think
they must be cousins to one another, and, one time, perhaps, they were brothers."

Leaving aside the question of the absolute correctness of the old man's observation there can
be no doubt that we have here a thinker who, being struck with the physiological similarity
of some animals is attempting to account for the fact, and does so along the lines of Darwin
and his predecessors, but without any of the facts and theories that were recorded before they
began their labours. I asked the old fellow if he had ever heard Selous talk about this matter,
and he said he had not; the idea, he said, had come out of his own head.

One day a Zambesi woman whose husband, a petty chief, was awaiting trial for murder at my station,
sent word to me asking for permission to dance that night in the compound. Surmising that there
was a religious motive behind this request I gave my consent, and afterwards watched the dancing
for an hour or so.

The element of rhythm in sound and movement has always been one of the chief means of exciting
and expressing religious exaltation as well as sexual passion, and the two emotions merge easily
in all primitive people whether they be the half-civilised moujiks of Russia, or the frequenters
of modern "Revival Meetings," or the naked Batonka on the banks of the Zambesi. The Batonka,
indeed, are particularly fond of dancing to the beat of the ubiquitous drum.

The woman, who was accompanied by a few of her female friends, danced with unusual grace, and
her movements were remarkably free from erotic incitation. Holding a pair of gourds in which
little stones rattled not unmusically, like castanets, she gyrated in the moonlight and pirouetted
on her toes with such lightness and elegance that my curiosity was roused, and the next morning
I had her brought to my office and asked her to account, if she could, for the marked difference
between her way of dancing and that of the rest of her people.

This is what she said: "I was very sad and my whole body was heavy. I felt ill, so I asked
that I might be allowed to dance. Dancing always does me good when I feel unwell. I did not
learn to dance in the way I do from anyone. I think the Great Spirit gave to me the gift of
dancing, the power came down on me when I was a child. I have never seen Europeans or Arabs
dancing. I have never seen an Arab dancing woman. I dance my way because the Spirit gave it
to me to do so."

I then asked her what it was that made her well. Was it the dancing or the profuse sweating
which I had noticed? "The Spirit," she said, "made me well, he gave me to dance, the dancing
made we sweat thereby cooling my body, and that made me well, it brought my heart back to its
right place."

This clear expression of concatenated thought from a Native woman who had had no missionary
tuition or other education of the Western kind shows to my mind sound reasoning capacity no
less developed than that met with in Europeans generally.

Turning over my notes I select, at random, a few more instances to illustrate my argument.

A Tebele youth of about twenty years of age, smooth-limbed and good looking, was charged some
years ago in the Rhodesian High Court with the crime of abducting two young Native girls for
his own immoral purposes. I made a note of the chief part of his speech in his own defence
at the time. This is what he said:

"I have the gift of singing and dancing, my father had it, and his father before him. When
I sing and dance people forget their sorrows, and when I leave a kraal, singing as I go, the
people follow me for the joy of my song, so that sometimes I have to drive them away. Now it
is easy to drive away old men and women, but who can drive away two pretty girls like these
that have been made to speak against me to-day? When I sang and danced at their kraal their
father gave me a goat because I had made his heart white and glad, and his daughters followed
me and joined in the play--and I am young! When I become old and can no longer sing and dance
the girls will not follow me. Why should I not be merry while I may? I never said a word to
these girls, they followed me, I did not call them. But now, if the white men who listen to
my words feel doubtful about what I say, then I would ask the judge to allow me to show them
here and now how I can dance and sing, and if, after hearing and seeing me do so, they still
think I am to blame, then I have no more to say; I shall go to gaol with a broken heart, and
silent."

The offer made by this African Apollo, I need not say, was not accepted, and he was found guilty
and sentenced to a term of imprisonment with hard labour, but I remember that several of the
jurymen expressed their astonishment afterwards at hearing so good a defence so pleasingly
expressed by a raw Native youth who had never been to any kind of school.

On one occasion I had some trouble to make a Native complainant understand that the evidence
upon which he relied was entirely hearsay and therefore of no avail against the man he wished
to charge with a crime of theft. While talking an elderly Tebele arrived and I put the matter
to him. He listened gravely and when I had finished he turned to the other and said:

"Have you not heard before that that which is heard only cannot be heard again in Court? You
must bring witnesses who saw and heard themselves what you say has happened. The words of the
man who says he heard the story from another is no testimony against a man when he is to be
tried for a crime or a debt."

After writing down this crisp and explicit statement from a Native whom I knew to have had
little or no intercourse with educated Europeans I asked the old man if he had ever heard the
matter discussed in a European Court. He said he had not, and seemed surprised that I should
consider his words worth putting down in a note-book.

When it is realised how few laymen amongst ourselves are able to grasp the distinction between
admissible and inadmissible evidence in a Court of Law, and how few would be able to express
themselves as clearly as did this old, so-called, heathen, then the instance is seen to be
worth citing.

I remember a Native witchdoctor who in defending himself against a charge of alleged witchcraft
practice spoke thus:

"The people you have heard to-day came to me and told me that they had had sickness and death
at their kraal. I knew these people and I knew that there had been strife among them for a
long time over the dividing of an inheritance. I threw the bones[18]--it is our way--and I
told these people that the spirit of the old woman, who was the grand-mother of most of them,
was angry because of the quarrelling that did not cease; I told them that the snakes, that
is to say the ancestral spirits of these people, were angry at the noise of the quarrelling,
and I told them to redeem their fault by killing a goat,--it is our way. And now it is said
that I have done wrong. In what way have I done wrong? I have heard a white missionary say
that the white man's God sends sickness to people when they sin, and that if the sinners leave
off their evil ways then they become well and happy again, and I said the same to these people--and
if they paid me ten shillings, why, do not the whites make payments to their priests?"

I might add, in parenthesis, that the argument advanced did not find favour with the magistrate
on the bench who, like so many of his kind, had little knowledge of Bantu lore and languages,
and who therefore could only perceive the letter of the law and not the human spirit behind
the acts that constituted a breach of the white man's statute.

The Natives, like most of the white people, prefer not to think overmuch about death and whether
there be life for us beyond the grave; like the vast majority of Europeans they prefer to take
the superstitions and beliefs of their forefathers for granted. Vague notions about ancestral
and familiar spirits that emanate from the grave in the guise of snakes or other animals are
accepted in the same spirit or traditional mood in which the doctrines and dogmas of the various
religions of Europe are accepted by the bulk of white believers.

I have found among the Bantu the same child-like faith in all that is proclaimed by traditional
authority about things supernatural, and I have found also among them the same hesitation or
inability to believe without questioning in all that is laid down in the name of tradition
that we see among ourselves. The will to believe is temperamental and general, but the unbeliever
is found among the Bantu as well as everywhere else.

I remember that I asked a raw Native once what he thought about the after-life in which so
many white and black people professed to believe. He answered: "The white people are a clever
race; they see many things in their books; perhaps they can see even beyond death. I do not
say that they are liars, as some of our people sometimes say. They may know these things, I
do not. All I know is that when I die this breath that is now in me so that I am able to think
and speak will leave my body which then must be put away in the ground: I think that will be
the end of me--but, not quite, for there,"--here he pointed to his infant son who was toddling
about in the strong sunlight--"there in him, my son," and his voice grew tender as he spoke,
"I shall live on because he is part of me, my life is in him; I cannot die altogether so long
as he lives, but if he should die and not leave a son to carry on my life, then should I die
the death utterly."

I recollect that when I wrote these clear words of an honest doubter there came to mind the
old Arab saying: "Whosoever leaveth no male hath no memory," which is but a confession of that
sense of doubt that has haunted the minds of men of all races and at all times while the people
as a whole have professed their hope and belief in a life everlasting.

I discussed the matter of polygamy with a Native youth one day, and made a note of his argument.
He said:

"In our district the young women are beginning to go against the man who wants more than one
wife. I have a young wife, and when I talk to her about taking a second wife she says that
she will not suffer it. She says that the white people do well in that the man and his wife
grow old together, whereas we Natives, as she says, we are like the cattle in the kraal; we
do not behave like human beings. But to this I answered that our fathers and mothers taught
us that one wife by herself cannot be happy and comfortable because when she falls sick, as
women often do, there is no one to help her, whereas when a man has two or more wives they
can help and nurse one another, they need not be sad or unhappy. I think our fathers way is
the good way and I shall follow it, but I know there will be trouble because of the new thoughts
my wife has taken from the white people."

Now I do not say that these instances show any remarkable intelligence or power of thinking,
but I do say that they show sound level-headed reasoning just like the common sense reasoning
from cause and effect which we find in the average European, and that they show, moreover,
that the same types of mental disposition and capacity are found in black and white alike.

It would indeed be easy for me to continue giving instances like these to show the essential
sameness of the nature of the minds of the black and white people, but I must consider the
weight of my book and the readers patience. I have refrained from pointing to those Natives
who have proved their scholastic capabilities at various universities and colleges because
it is generally surmised that these men are exceptional or that their success is due to a highly
developed imitative faculty coupled with a strong memory, with which it is fashionable to credit
the successful Native student, and I have advisedly confined myself to instances drawn from
the everyday life and thought of the normal and uneducated Native people.

I have lived amongst the Bantu for nearly thirty years and I have studied them closely, and
I have come to the conclusion that there is no Native mind distinct from the common human mind.
The mind of the Native is the mind of all mankind; it is not separate or different from the
mind of the European or the Asiatic any more than the mind of the English is different from
that of the Scotch or Irish people. The English way of speaking differs from that of the French,
but there is no reason for thinking that the mind of the two people differs in any way whatever.
The languages of the world are many but the mind of the world is one.

There are, I know, some white men who talk knowingly about a Native mind which they allege
to be unlike their own, a mind of whose strange anfractuosities they profess a special knowledge,
but these people must not be taken seriously. They are always half-educated men, suffering,
as Cardinal Newman said, from that haziness of intellectual vision which is so common among
all those who have not had a really good education. These people pretend to a knowledge which
is impossible, seeing that we can only know and understand the minds of other people by assuming
that they are like our own so that if we postulate a Native mind different from our own it
must of necessity remain unknowable by us, for what is psychology but the power of understanding
others from our understanding of ourselves?

The judge on the bench and the priest in the confessional follow the thoughts and feelings
of the minds they have to deal with, not by virtue of any special power of divination, but
simply by judging their fellow-men's way of thinking and feeling to be even as their own.

The truth of the matter is that all men think in the same way, but not always about the same
things. There is no such thing as an inherent racial mind but there are different national
and racial cultures lasting sometimes for centuries, like that of China, and some times only
for a generation, like that of modern Germany. But these differences are temporary and outward
and not inwardly heritable. The difference between the mind of the philosopher and the plough-boy
is one not of kind, not even of degree, but of content. The things that occupy the mind of
the peasant farmer are not the same that fill the mind of the university don, but if the respective
environments of the two types had been reversed the professor might have thought about manure
and the farmer about metaphysics. And this holds good also of nations and races. Consider,
for instance, the German people who before the rise of Bismarck were looked upon as a nation
of peaceful peasants and Gelerhten, "ces bons Allemands," in contemporary French parlance,
and how they became within a few years through being made to think constantly about their own
national supremacy, a race of ruthless warriors that terrorised and nearly conquered Europe
in the Great World War. The mind of the German race had not been changed, but the main business
of that mind had been changed through the imposition on the growing masses of a new ideal,
the ideal of dominion in the hands of the German people.

The difference between the mental status of the white man and the Native is the same as that
which we notice between the man who has had a liberal education and the man who has not, and
it lies mainly in the fact that the one is given to introspection, analysis and criticism whereas
the other, whether he be a European peasant or a Bantu herdsman, looks outward, takes things
for granted and asks no questions, so that with the Bantu as with the illiterate European,
the primitive thoughts and ways of their forefathers are held good enough by their sons, but
this does not preclude the latent potentiality in both for the understanding and acquisition
of new thoughts and ways once the shackles of conservatism have been loosened and cast aside.

In his thinking about the things he knows the black man comes to the same conclusion as the
white man when he thinks about the same things. The black man does not think about electricity
or the differential calculus because he knows nothing about these matters, neither, and for
the same reason, does the European peasant wherever he may still be found in his primitive
state. It has been alleged in America and in South Africa that Negro and Bantu children, when
compared with European children in both countries, show not only comparative slowness in the
study of arithmetic, but that they are on the whole less accurate in their work, and this I
readily believe, for the reason that the home surroundings of the black children are seldom
as favourable to the development of speed and exactness as they are among Europeans. It is
not considered "good form" among Natives to do things in a hurry, slowness is regarded as essential
to good manners; moreover the craving for speed and exactitude is everywhere a feature of high-pressure
city life rather than of life in the country. The town artisan of to-day must be quick and
accurate, whereas the agricultural labourer is found satisfactory so long as he is a steady
worker, and the home atmosphere of the two types is bound to be affected by these considerations.
The home atmosphere of the ordinary Bantu family in process of acquiring the ways of Western
civilisation will be more like that of the agricultural labourer than of the town artisan or
shopkeeper, and it is conceded on every hand that the home influence has a direct and important
bearing on the children's progress in school. Take as an example the children of the back-veld
Dutch in South Africa. I have been told by many of their teachers that the difficulty in teaching
these children is not so much to make them work as to rouse them to a sense of the importance
of speed and accuracy, and yet we often see children from this class growing into men and women
of very high intellectual ability.

There are also some who think that the Native has no great capacity for mechanics and engineering
generally, but I have seen so many instances of mechanical resourcefulness and inventiveness
in Natives who have only had a superficial acquaintance with machinery that I cannot doubt
that with technical education like that given to European apprentices they will attain to proficiency
equal to that of the whites.

I do not profess the knowledge of a pedagogue in these matters. I speak simply from an insight
gained through many years of observation and study at first hand. I have listened to thousands
of old Native men of many different tribes in my time, I have heard them speak their inmost
thoughts, not through interpreters--who ever learned anything through an interpreter?--I have
studied these people in and out of Court, officially and privately, in their kraals and in
the veld during many years, and I say that I can find nothing whatever throughout the whole
gamut of the Native's conscious life and soul to differentiate him from other human beings
in other parts of the world. In his sense of sorrow and of humour, in his moral intuitions,
in his percipience of proportion and in all the subtle elements that go to make up the mental
constitution of modern man, I see no difference in him from the European variety which to-day
stands at the highest point of human achievement, but I freely confess that the African Native
has so far shown a lack of that will to think analytically and critically which in the civilised
man is the result of a continuous discontent with things as they are, a discontent which has
urged him up to his present plane of racial supremacy.

But the reason for the fact that the African Natives have never thought as hard and as long
as the ancient and modern peoples of other lands lies not, I think, in a lack of inherent capacity
but in a lack of opportunity, the meaning of which now comes to be considered.

ACHIEVEMENT.

We have now come to the point where an answer must be given to the question: If the African
Natives are on the whole endowed with a mental capacity equal to that possessed by the Europeans
why have they never achieved any civilisation at all comparable with those cultures which have
been successively set up by the people of Europe, Asia and Ancient America?

If we take it for granted that the Africans have never achieved a civilisation similar to those
that date back beyond the limits of history, a premiss by no means assured seeing that there
are signs of cycles of civilisations coming before those of which we have written or monumental
records and of whose ethnic origin there is no certain knowledge, then the question may appear
to have no other answer than the assumed lack of inherent capacity in the black race, but let
us consider the matter closely.

The question asked depends upon the proposition that achievement is the sole test of capacity
or, in other words, that achievement must necessarily follow capacity, and this is a proposition
by no means free from doubt. It is plain that a desire to achieve is a condition precedent
to achievement but it is equally plain that there may well be ability without ambition. The
question why civilisation has not followed apparent capacity may with equal propriety be asked
about races whose mental abilities have never been doubted. Consider, for instance, two such
widely separated races as the Red Indians of our own times and the Northmen who roamed over
the seas in the days of Alfred the Great.

The North American Indians, though they achieved no civilisation to be compared with the cultures
of Mexico and Peru, yet conserved a very high degree of initiative in other directions. According
to competent observers, these people have shown a capacity for wiliness and a power of divination
of the obscured workings of nature and of the human mind which have never been surpassed elsewhere.
That the high moral and mental status of these people is fully recognised by their European
successors is proved by the fact that many Americans in high stations to-day actually boast
of having in their veins the blood of the North American Indian. And yet these highly gifted
people had not when Columbus discovered America attained to the knowledge of iron. Despite
the advantages of a most favourable environment and a stimulating climate, the Red Indians
were in point of mechanical development behind the earliest Bantu; they had no iron implements,
no tillage and no settled or permanent abodes, and whatever may have been the cause of their
lack of development, the fact remains that there was no achievement despite undeniable capacity.

The early Scandinavians who lived in a state of barbarism ages before and long after Egypt,
Mesopotamia, India, Greece and Rome developed their various civilisations, furnish another
illustration of the fact that there may well be capacity without accomplishment, for no one
can doubt the keenness of the minds of these people who have advanced to the front ranks of
human endeavour. These rude sea-rovers must have lived in what is generally supposed to have
been a most stimulating climate during long ages while other races in Southern Europe and in
Asia built up mighty civilisations within environments that seem to have been far less incitative
of progress.

Although the broad facts of history are known to us the causes that have contributed in the
past to keep down some races while other peoples who were no better endowed or situated rose
to the greatest heights of human effort cannot be stated with certainty. It is easy to cite
the circumstances that are commonly conjectured as accounting for the origin and growth of
civilisation, such as soil, climate and geographical position, but it is equally easy to point
to times and places when and where great civilisations have arisen under conditions that have
concurred elsewhere with miserable stagnation in rude barbarism.

Climate is, perhaps, the factor which is most generally condescended upon as being the chief
of the causes that contribute to that collective accomplishment which we call civilisation,
but the connection between the two things is far from clear, indeed it seems to be often negatived
by actual facts. Seeing, for instance, that the easy fruition of desire which is possible in
tropical and sub-tropical latitudes does away with the idea of necessity as the mother of invention
in those parts of the world it becomes difficult to see how tool-using man, who is generally
supposed to have originated somewhere in the warm belts, came to take the first and the most
difficult steps in the upward progress where there was so little, if any, incentive to that
sustained effort and concentration of the mind which is required for the thinking out of the
most difficult of all thoughts, the first principles of any art or craft. Why, we may well
ask, should the primitive African have worried about cultivating the soil where edible roots
and berries abounded? Why should he have bothered about making fire where there was no need
of artificial warmth or for the cooking of food? Why should he have cudgeled his brains to
fashion weapons and to contrive snares for the killing of game of which he was in no more need
than his vegetarian cousins, the anthropoid apes? Why should there have been progress where
the environment provided no stimuli therefore, in other words, why should primitive man have
moved forward where indulgent nature allowed him to stand still?

If we believe, with Darwin and other students, that our primitive ancestors emerged from somewhere
within the warm zones, we cannot avoid the difficulty of reconciling that supposition with
the theory that civilisation is in the first instance the result of a stimulating environment.
If on the other hand, we surmise that homo sapiens originated in the colder parts of the world
we still have to account for the fact that his further progress was made not in those parts
but in warmer latitudes where a genial climate afforded no apparent provocation for continued
effort in the way of invention and general development.

It would seem that the innate tendency to conservatism latent in man, the disposition to leave
things as they are and to stick to the familiar devil rather than fly to unknown gods, is in
itself sufficient to account for those lapses in mass-achievement and those long periods of
stagnation which mark the course of mankind everywhere. We see how Egypt hovered for centuries
on the brink of the discovery of the alphabet but never attained thereto. The exponents of
the so-called "pulsatory hypothesis" can hardly claim that a change in the climate will explain
the fact seeing that the neighbouring people were able to accomplish this great feat under
very similar climatic conditions. We see how China developed a wonderful civilisation while
the Western world lay steeped in barbarism, and then went to sleep till now. The size of that
great country made possible always the friction between people coming from widely separated
localities, which we believe to be conducive to progress, and the climate and general environment
seems to have been no less favourable than in Europe and America. We see how the Arabs made
great conquests and enriched the world with many patient and accurate observations and then
came to a standstill and remained as they are to-day in serene contentment, strangers to the
very idea of progress. Can it be said that mental capacity and collective will-power were lacking
in any of these people? On the contrary, it is admitted that they were possessed of mental
powers as great as those of the restless Europeans of to-day who are rushing onward in a ceaseless
pursuit of change, a pursuit made possible only by continuous victory over the forces of conservatism,
and this victory, as I think, is gained not through the outward circumstances of climate and
geographical surroundings, but through a "divine discontent" which is kindled, we know not
how, in the leaders of the world, regardless of time and place, as says the poet of one whom
he hails as the deliverer of his country:

    "A flaming coal
    Lit at the stars and sent
    To burn the sin of patience from her soul,
    The scandal of content."

It is this inward fire rather than any outward pressure that prompts the captive spirit to
break loose from the fetters of the unmoving giant, custom, the greatest of all tyrants, who
grows stronger as he grows older. The difficulty of reversing the ways and conditions that
have been induced from birth is tremendous, and progress has never been possible without breaking
away, always at great risk to the innovators, the stoned prophets of all ages, from the powerful
grip of hoary and hallowed custom, which is the essence of conservatism. Initiative implies
the breaking of the commandment which enjoins everyone to honour his father and mother that
he may live long in the land, a sanction which entails continued adherence to the ancestral
ways and ideas, and which, being rooted in instinctive fear of innovation, has power over us all.

Progress, then, has everywhere been the result, in the beginning, of individual initiative
in men who were possessed of the power of personality, the "born" leaders of the world who,
whether they figured as chiefs or kings, witchdoctors or priests, prophets or lawgivers, were
all reformers in their various ways. We see how these restless spirits have appeared everywhere
at irregular intervals, not only in localities favoured by nature, but often in the most unlikely
places, and there is no reason for thinking that this sporadic cropping up of new leaders will
ever cease.

But although we believe that progress has been started always and everywhere by the efforts
of reformers that have occurred as spontaneous variations from the dead level of their fellows
independent of time and circumstances, we need not deny the effect of environment, especially
the effect of an inimical environment, upon a new movement after it has been started, and it
may well be that the physical disadvantages of the great "dark" continent may have made difficult,
if not impossible, in the past that meeting and friction of different cultures which seem to
be essential to the birth of intellectual life, so that here the admitted isolation of the
inhabitants during many centuries may have served to squelch initiative and foster stagnation.
Nevertheless the influence of environment must not be over-rated for we see that general contentment
with resulting inertia have existed for untold ages in places where now the sounds and shocks
of daily progress reverberate in a thousand fields of civilised activity without any change
being discernible either in the bodily or mental calibre of the people themselves, and this
must surely teach us that it is not incapacity nor yet unfavourable physical environment, but
that, more than anything else, it is the dead weight of human conservatism that holds down
a nation or a race to its particular level; that it is the human element in the general milieu
that determines human development, a lesson that has been well summed up in the Chinese aphorism
"A man is more like the age he lives in than he is like his father and mother."

Some years ago a theory was advanced which assumed the presence from the beginning of an inherently
superior race of blond Europeans who, it was supposed, left their lairs in the North from time
to time to harass and conquer essentially inferior people in the South whom they innervated
through intermarriage with their superior mentality, and thereby succeeded in rearing those
mighty civilisations that waned and fell when the "blue" blood of the invaders became absorbed
and lost in the old autochthonous streams. Apart from the lack of cogent evidence this theory,
if it may be so called, is unsatisfactory in that it does not explain why these putative super-men
failed to establish within their own stimulating environment any of those great cultures that
were set up in places and under climatic conditions which are supposed to have been far less
provocative to progress. To-day the theories of Gobineau and Houston Chamberlain who both held
up the Teutons as being at all times the greatest and noblest of human kind, do not impress
the non-Teuton part of the world, nor do the later apostles of the more recent "Nordic" race
faith, like Madison Grant, and others of his school, succeed in persuading thinking men and
women that the Scandinavians and the English are the only people that ever could initiate and
sustain great civilisations. The fact that great civilisations have been built up and are now
being developed by people who were and are neither blond nor Nordic makes it impossible to
believe these pretensions to exclusive racial genius and merit. "All the talk," says Professor
Flinders Petrie, "about Nordic supremacy is vanity when we look at the facts in Europe. Dark
Iberians and Picts, Asiatics, Gaels and Celts, are the basis of our peoples. Further, it is
in the time of stress and difficulty that the older stocks come again to the top. The majority
of the men of power among the Allies have not been fair Nordics but dark men of the underlying
races."[19]

Recent study has indeed dissipated that fascinating idyl about the old race of tall, blond
Aryans as the originators of our present civilisation, for it has been shown that the so-called
Aryan civilisation was inferior in many ways to the primitive culture of neolithic times, and
it can now hardly be doubted that our classical civilisation is of Mediterranean origin though
Aryanised in speech. It is now generally accepted that history points not to Scandinavia and
Germany, but to the lands lying round the Mediterranean Sea as furnishing the matrix out of
which civilisation has sprung. It is to the South rather than to the North, to the early people
of Egypt, Palestine, Greece and Rome, and not to the primitive inhabitants of Scandinavia and
Germany, that we must look for those great men whose intellect and character were strong enough
to overcome the natural conservatism of their times. The mind of the early white men of the
North never soared higher than a valhalla peopled with puerile deities and blood-stained warriors
whereas the swarthy thinkers of the South discovered the unseen God, invented art and philosophy
and developed law and government. The Dwelling to effort, existence could ensue decline. Its ally had

 It
has been stated by independent and competent witnesses, who are corroborated by German newspapers
of good standing, that the black troops have a very marked attraction for a large number of
German women, and that the German men hate the black men because the German women do not.[22]
The fact that white women in South Africa and in the Southern States of America never associate
with black men does not, I think, prove that they are controlled by instinctive racial or sexual
aversion but rather that women, as a whole, are, by reason of their physical inability to dispute
with men the ultimate ratio of all order that lies in brute force, thoroughly amenable to the
rule of social conventions imposed upon them by their jealous masters. I say this because we
see that the aversion that has been inculcated from without tends to disappear wherever the
man-established conventions lapse or cease to govern either through the comparatively small
numbers of black men being insufficient in certain localities to cause fear in the white men
living there, as in some seaport towns, or through the temporary break-down of the customary
standards of society brought about by war and revolution, as in those parts of Germany that
were recently garrisoned by coloured soldiers.

Nature having cast upon the male the duty of winning and holding the females of his species
it is easy to see why the racial feelings of jealousy and ill-will are more positive and more
active in the man than in the woman, and this explains, as far as these things can be explained,
why white men will allow themselves to cohabit freely with black women to whom they feel naturally
attracted but will "see red" and commit murder as soon as they find a black man attempting
to gain the favour of a woman of their own colour. "Un adolescent aime toutes les femmes" say
the French, and it is generally accepted that man is by nature more inclined to polygamy than
woman is towards polyandry, still man and woman are both swayed and motived by the same elemental
jealousy that is born of fear of losing something valued; the emotion which Descartes has so
well defined as "une espèce de crainte qui se rapport au désir qu'on a de se conserver la possession
de quelque bien."

It is, no doubt, true that the thinking white woman, no less than the thinking white man, is
led to feel dismay and even resentment against the Natives by apprehension of the possibility
of danger to white civilisation through fusion of white and black, but this is a feeling caused
by intelligent appreciation rather than by instinctive apprehension, and as such liable to
be dispelled by argument tending to show that no real danger threatens. During a recent agitation
against miscegenation in Rhodesia a number of letters written by white women appeared in the
press from which it was easy to gather that the chief concern of the writers was not the possible
degradation of the whites, though this was not overlooked, but rather the simple fact that
some white men were cohabiting with black women to the prejudice of the matrimonial chances
of eligible women of their own race.

But it is unwise to dogmatise in the realms of social and racial psychology; we have not yet
discovered the means for analysing with precision the subtle elements of the human soul.

If we believe that racial antipathy is caused by the feeling of jealousy that arises instinctively,
so to speak, from man's inner nature, then it is safe to say that it will last as long as the
substance from which it springs, and as long as the racial difference which provokes it remains,
but this belief is not firmly established in the general mind. The whites, as a whole, feel
far from sure about the permanence of their cherished pride and prejudice of race; they are,
more or less consciously afraid that the antipathy upon which they rely may become weakened
and eventually dissipated by close contact of the two races in places where economic pressure
has reduced both to the same level of life. We shall do well to remember the words of Renan
when we try to estimate the truth of this matter, "La verité consiste dans les nuances," for
both estimates may be true; the racial instinct may have to yield here and there to the superior
force of economic pressure, and may yet in the main prove powerful enough to prevent the contact
that tends to render it of no effect.

The racial feeling which we are considering is undoubtedly much stronger at present in the
whites than in the Bantu, but there is reason to believe that the awakening desire for racial
self-assertion which we call pride of race will grow and increase in the Bantu as it has done
in the Negroes in the Southern States of America, and elsewhere. General education, so far
from hindering the growth of nationalism and racialism seems in some sort to subserve and foster
that growth; witness the strident self-assertion of the newly-constituted little nations in
Europe, and the cult of "Nationalism" in South Africa to-day. It is natural for birds of feather
to flock together and screech together, and in the same way throughout mankind particular groups
of people tend naturally to keep together and to marry among themselves separately from the
rest of the community by which they happen to be surrounded, and this ethnic instinct, if so
it may be called, is seen to operate even where, as among the Italian immigrants in America,
there is no great racial difference between them and the Native-born inhabitants, and, much
more markedly, in the Southern States of America where, according to a recent observer, the
present tendency is not towards but away from miscegenation, so that the ultimate blending
of colour is not likely to take place there in the course of nature.[23]

The normal Native man does not hanker after white women, and the normal Native woman is not,
as a rule, anxious to mate with a white man, but this normal disposition is apt to be disturbed
by the familiarity which is bred by the close contact that occurs in towns and other centres.
It is not, therefore, safe to deny the possibility that with advancing industrialism in congested
areas there will be some white women ready to marry or cohabit with Native men who are either
in positions of relative superiority or in possession of more money than their white fellow-workers
or neighbours, making it possible for them to outbid these in the providing of comparative
ease and luxury, which things have always appealed strongly to women of all races. Yet I think
that those who prophesy the speedy merging of the two races in South Africa do not give sufficient
weight to the fact of the collective consciousness of a racial entity which, being strongly
established in the European section, is also being fostered and increased in the Natives by
the civilisation which is now spreading among them, so that it seems reasonable to expect that
the European aversion from racial blending will be reciprocated from the Native side more and
more as time goes on, and that this reciprocal feeling will go far towards keeping the two
races biologically intact. I think, therefore, that despite the conditions that conduce to
miscegenation, the factor of the growing and reciprocal desire in both races to remain ethnically
separate will gain the day.

Many people think that the coloured people in South Africa, who are most numerous in the vicinity
of Cape Town, but are also scattered all over the country, will form, as it were, a bridge
between the two sections of the population for their eventual coalescence. But when this conclusion
is closely examined it is seen to rest on debatable premises, for it is admitted that by far
the greater part of the miscegenation that is now going on is between white men and coloured
or black women and not between coloured or black men and white women, from which it follows,
as has been pointed out by Boas,[24] that, as the numbers of children born does not depend
upon the numbers of men but upon the numbers of women, the result will be a bleaching of the
black element, here and there, and not a darkening of the whites in South Africa.

Statistics have, indeed, been quoted which show that between the year 1904 and the year 1911
the coloured population increased in the Cape Province by fifteen per cent, while the total
population increased by only six and a half per cent., but these figures do not show how much
of the coloured increase is due to propagation among coloured people themselves and how much
to unions between white men and coloured women. When it is noted that in the year 1911 the
European increase over the year 1904 in the whole Union of South Africa was 14.28 per cent.,
and that of all non-European elements only 15.12 per cent., it will be seen that although the
black increase is on a larger basis it hardly justifies alarm over an imagined flood of overwhelming
coloured numbers.

If the coloured increase is due chiefly to propagation among the coloured people themselves
then it forms a good argument against those who assert that the half-caste is relatively inclined
to sterility, while if the increase is found to be due to cohabitation of white men with coloured
women then it is a fair illation that the coloured section is in process of absorption by the
whites. This assumed process of absorption will, no doubt, entail the presence of a certain,
even a large, number of coloured people for many generations to come, but this number will
grow smaller, and not greater, as time goes on because there is no reason to doubt that the
white women of South Africa, as a whole, will refrain in the future as they have refrained
in the past from cohabiting with black men, so that the observed tendency towards the diffusion
of the coloured element back into the parent streams will be allowed to continue.

But let us for a moment look calmly, and as far as possible without prejudice, at the people
who in South Africa are said to furnish the awful example of the alleged evil of the crossing
of white and black. The fact that the denunciation of these people is based on opposite and
contradictory arguments shows that it is not the result of clear thinking. On the one side
it is vehemently asserted that the coloured man is a physiological misfit, a sort of hybrid
unfit for the society of either white or black and an alleged relative sterility of his kind
is advanced as proof of this assertion. On the other side it is said, with equal vehemence,
that the coloured people are mongrels, unfit to mingle with the pure parental breeds, and that
this is proved by their excessive fecundity. The coloured people are also accused of being
inferior in physical constitution when compared with either of the parent races, and therefore
undesirable.

My own observations, corroborated by the opinions of many other observers, leads me to believe
that the fecundity of the coloured people is neither greater nor less than that of other people--white,
black or yellow--whose birthrate is not artificially restricted, and that their general physical
constitution, when not undermined by disease or stunted by underfeeding, is as strong as that
of any other human variety. The great naturalist, Wallace, has insisted that some degree of
difference favours fertility, but that a little more tends to infertility, and by applying
this hypothesis to the facts as I have observed them I am led to believe that there is no biological
difference between the Bantu and the European of a degree sufficient to produce any difference,
one way or the other, in the fertility of the offspring of the two races, but proper statistics,
continued over several generations, will, of course, be required to prove or disprove this
conclusion.

The gravest, and, as I think, the most unjust of the many charges brought against these people
by an unthinking public, is that the half-caste, wherever he is found, partakes of all the
vices but of none of the virtues of his parents. When we remember that in the towns of South
Africa the coloured people of necessity form the class that in the nature of things is peculiarly
exposed to the temptations of prostitution and crime, then it becomes a matter for wonder that
these people are as good and as law-abiding as indeed they are. People who know South Africa
will admit that the coloured girl is from childhood exposed to the temptation of loose-living
far more than either the Native girl in the kraal or the European girl in her home, and that
the coloured boys and youths, by reason of the lack of the right kind of home-influence, which
is the result of the unfavourable position in life of the bulk of their parents, naturally
gravitate towards the levels where it becomes difficult to avoid crime. But despite all these
adverse conditions that press so heavily against them the coloured people of South Africa,
taken as a whole, stand justified of the calumnies uttered against them. The coloured people
as a whole are not behind the whites in anything except in the lack of opportunity for education
and self-improvement, a lack caused not by themselves, but by their inimical surroundings.

That many of the coloured people are immoral and shiftless need not be denied; the same may
be said about the "poor whites," who as a class perplex well-meaning legislators, but neither
of these proved accusations give reason for thinking that either of these classes is inherently
inferior to their more favourably-placed fellow-beings. We must always remember the tremendous
handicap of being reared in the depressing surroundings of sloth and squalor. I have seen hundreds
of poor whites--as white as any blond German could wish to be--who seemed utterly unfit for
the complexities of civilised life, but I have also seen many of the children of these people
who, after being removed from their home surroundings, have risen to positions of usefulness
and trust, in which they have earned reputations for integrity and capacity. The trenchant
saying of a British working-man is in point, "Treat a man like a dog and he will behave like
a dog," and the corollary is equally true, that if you treat a man as a man he will, as a rule,
rise and quit himself like a man.

The familiar cry that once white blood is diluted with black it is "all up" with our civilisation
is not convincing when we remember that the ground-work of this civilisation was built up by
races that were not "pure white"; that the white civilisation during the dark ages sank to
a very low level through no dilution of African blood, and that it was a mixed race, the Moors,
who brought back into Europe the lost principles of Aristotelian science on which the crumbling
structure of European culture was rebuilt. To believe that the people of Asia and of Africa
may be capable of attaining to Western civilisation, but that the offspring produced by the
crossing of these races with whites will not have the necessary capacity therefor is to me
impossible. So far from being deterrent to mental growth it would seem that an infusion of
African blood in the European serves rather to increase mental capacity; at any rate, those
who know South Africa well will not deny that an unmistakable tincture of African blood in
a white family is often associated with marked intellectual ability. Against this concession
it has indeed been alleged that, while it must be admitted that a small admixture of black
blood in a white race enriches it, a small admixture of white blood in a black race degrades
it, but this fanciful notion has not been supported by scientific data. The truth of the matter
is that as the blacks are the underdogs, the half-breed becomes a racial and social bastard,
as indeed he is openly named in South Africa, a man condemned before he is tried, handicapped
from birth in a way that would drag down and keep under most of those who shout loudest about
their racial superiority. It is his condition and not his nature that keeps the coloured man
underneath.

To the man who in face of the facts of history and of to-day believes that all we have of civilisation
we owe to the Teutonic or to the Nordic type of man, and that nothing good can ever come out
of coloured Nazareths, the possibility of the whites in South Africa becoming browned by the
selective agency of tropical light or by an infusion of African blood, no doubt, seems an evil
to be prevented at any cost, but those who, like myself, have seen coloured women working in
their homes as thriftily and self-sacrificingly as the best of our own women, and coloured
men labouring steadily against heavy odds to improve their condition, have become convinced
that the coloured people of South Africa suffer under no inherent disabilities when compared
with the whites, and for this reason we cannot join in the general wail over a predicted evil
which we regard as exaggerated in itself and not, moreover, likely to happen. I would not,
however, be taken to advocate the inter-breeding of white and black. Those who have witnessed
the misery and suffering which the coloured people have to endure for being coloured will welcome
any fair means of preventing miscegenation in South Africa. Proscriptive legislation has been
advocated by both the detractors and the defenders of the half-breed, as a means of preventing
what both schools, for their different reasons, regard as wrong and undesirable, but I cannot
agree that it can ever be right or expedient to penalise and make criminal a natural act which
under existing conditions is in many places unavoidable.

There can be no doubt that the evil of miscegenation in South Africa has been greatly exaggerated,
both in respect of its nature and its extent, but, nevertheless, so long as the racial prejudice
of the white man remains as strong as it is to-day--and there is nothing to show that it is
likely to decrease in the future--so long will it be the duty of all good citizens to discourage
by persuasion and precept the production of children for whom the ruling race has no love and
little pity. Even those among the whites who, in a spirit of good will and tolerance urge that
the coloured people should receive preferential treatment because of the white blood which
is in them, cannot escape having their point of view warped by their racial prepossession,
for, surely, it is not because of a man's class or colour that he is treated as a man to-day
but because of his being a civilised member of a civilised community. Nevertheless, the day
when civilisation shall be the sole qualification for full membership of the civilised community
of South Africa is not yet.

I say, therefore, in answer to the question whether, without the full fraternity which seems
impossible here, the white and the black races may not live together in South Africa in political
liberty and equality, that the trend of events leads to the belief that the established pride
of race of the whites, and the growing pride of race among the Natives will conduce to voluntary
separation wherever this is possible, and that in this way the coming generations will contrive
to live territorially separate under a common governance, founded upon political equality and
liberty.

CONCLUSION.

The evidence before us leads inevitably to the conclusion that there is nothing in the mental
constitution, or in the moral nature of the South African Native, to warrant his relegation
to a place of inferiority in the land of his birth, but the same evidence also leads to the
conclusion that the racial antipathy which prevails to-day will remain unaffected by this admission,
seeing that this racial animosity is caused not by alleged mental disparity but by unalterable
physical difference between the two races.

It is important that this distinction be grasped for it goes to the root of the matter. It
is the marked physical dissimilarity of the black man that rouses the fear and jealousy of
the white man, and not any inherent mental inferiority in him. And we must take human nature
as we find it, inscrutable and immutable as it is; wherefore we must reckon with, and not hastily
condemn, the imponderable purpose of a fundamental instinct which is older than speech and
deeper than thought, so that, although we admit that this racial antipathy is not justified
by logical reasoning, we may nevertheless recognise it as a feeling grounded in man's inner
nature--in his heart, so to speak--hardening it against other men whom he feels he cannot receive
and entreat as brothers; in other words, we may say that this feeling is not the result of
ratiocination but of forces that are deeper and more elemental than reason; that it is a hardening
of heart rather than a mental conviction, in which sense we may apply the words of Pascal "Le
caeur a ses raisons que la raison ne connait pas."

This idea of parallelism is based on the presumption that the ruling race can so rule itself
that by the mere exercise of its collective will-power it can refuse always to mix socially
with the growing numbers of civilised Natives living and working in the same localities, and
thereby--in a manner not yet explained--avoid always the clashing and ill-will that seems inseparable
from the close contact of two dissimilar races competing against one another in one country.
The advice offered from afar is that the whites should allow the Natives equal opportunities
with themselves in all the ways of civilised activity, but--should not invite them home to
dinner. Being based on an unwarranted presumption parallelism here begs the question, for it
is precisely the ability of the ruling race to follow this counsel of perfection that is in
doubt. It is easy to urge that the Europeans must maintain their position in South Africa as
"a benevolent aristocracy of ability," but we want to know how this can be done. A recent contributor
to the general question of colour has stated that the true conception of the inter-relation
of white and black races should be "complete uniformity in ideals, absolute equality in the
paths of knowledge and culture, equal opportunity for those who strive, equal admiration for
those who achieve; in matters social and racial a separate path, each pursuing his own inherited
traditions, preserving his own race-purity and race-pride; equality in things spiritual; agreed
divergence in the physical and material."[25] But, again, we want to know how this abstract
conception is to be put into actual practice in this world of things as they are.

I have said that the Natives do not hanker after intimate social intimacy with the whites,
but this does not mean that the civilised black man who has risen to the economic and educational
level of the European remains indifferent whenever his claim to ordinary social recognition
is denied or ignored. He would not, indeed, be human if he did not feel hurt whenever he is
slighted and treated with contempt by people from whom he differs only in his physical appearance
and colour. In one of his essays, dealing with Native matters, Professor Jabavu, a Native,
describes how "high" feeling arose among the Native teachers and boys in a certain training
institution in South Africa at which he had been invited to lecture because he was not allowed
to see the inside of the European principal's house, despite the fact that he had ten years
of English university life behind him.[26] Such feeling is only natural and must tend always
to create ill-will, and, knowing how strong is the convention of the whites against social
recognition of the educated Native, we must expect increased bitterness in the future, rather
than growing good-will.

The thinking white man, who would fain be just to every one, is perplexed by two conflicting
emotions. He feels that the clean-living, law-abiding, educated Native is a man not inferior
to himself whom he therefore ought to recognise as a fellow-citizen, but whenever he sees this
fellow-citizen aspiring or laying claim to the social recognition that involves contact with
white women he is filled instantly with wrath which he cannot justify to himself and yet cannot
suppress. It is easy to see that where instead of common courtesy and mutual recognition from
one another of two sections of a community, constant irritation and ill-will result, there
the existence of the whole is threatened with disaster. Under such conditions we must expect,
not parallel progress, but strife and enmity; not peace, but a sword.

The Jews may be cited to show how a separate and peculiar people may be able to live together
with other races without either clashing with or being assimilated by these but we must remember
that the ethnic difference between the Jews and Europeans are too slight to sustain serious
and lasting race-antipathy. Parallelism, when applied to the Native problem of South Africa,
is clearly nothing more than the old, plan-less drift continued in the pious hope that human
nature will sooner or later change into something better than what it is to-day. But human
nature will not change. We must never leave passion out of account. If we recognise love we
must recognise hate also as a moving force of mankind. Neither must we overlook vanity and
arrogance. The white man, being human, will not cease to be vain and ambitious, he will not
cease to feel the hatred that comes from the fear of losing possession of his mates, and possession
is the natural man's definition of love. Where there is a sense of possession there will also
be jealousy and hate, and it will only be by securing the white man in his sense of racial
integrity that peace and good-will can be made to last.

Territorial separation of the home-life of the two races is the only way by which parallel
development can take place. Some of the Native leaders who have opposed this policy have done
so in the belief that their people might eventually be able to prove and enforce their claim
to full racial equality, but they have not realised that this claim will be denied always on
physical grounds, and not on considerations of moral worth. These leaders mean well but they
do not see well. Smarting under the pain of their treatment they do not perceive that the real
issue is one of unalterable physical disparity.

The hardships and disabilities under which the educated Native suffers in the Northern Provinces
of the Union and in Rhodesia are patent and serious. It is hard that a civilised man may not
travel in his own country without a "certificate"; it is hard that he must do only rough or
menial, but always ill-paid, work when he is capable of doing skilled and well-paid labour;
it is hard that when he is allowed to do skilled labour he cannot claim the wages of a skilled
labourer; it is hard to be denied always the privileges of a civilised existence for which
he has proved himself fit and worthy; it is hard to be treated always as an inferior and an
alien in the land of his fathers; all this is hard, but--'tis the law, written and unwritten,
made and enforced by the dominant race, and there is no reason to think it will be made less
hard as the pressure of black competition increases.

But if good and ample land can be set aside in the various territories of spacious South Africa
in which the Natives can live and move without let or hindrance; in which they can do what
work they like for themselves and for their own people; in which they can engage, according
to their individual desires, in all kinds of trades and commerce without the prohibition of
the white man's colour-bar; in which they can earn the wages that are governed by the laws
of supply and demand only; in which they can build up after their own fashion courts of law
and political councils for themselves; in which, in fine they can live and work out their own
salvation, unhurried and unworried by strange and impatient masters, then, surely, the Natives
of South Africa will have gained a great gain, far greater than any they can ever hope to win
by pitting their undeveloped strength against the organised resistance of the whites.

and has an existence may be impaired of guidance, had a Hostility

element fall may have come, and do any longings of enemies have been
gratified, and yet earlier than there was a humiliation?



Some people have professed to be afraid that the territorial separation of the two races will
tend to consolidate the Natives, and thereby foster animosity towards the whites which may
eventually lead to open war, but this fear seems to have no ground in reason, because it is
not proposed, nor, indeed, would it be physically possible, to segregate the Natives by themselves
in one great area. On the contrary, it is proposed to dispose of the Natives, as far as possible,
according to present geographical and tribal conditions, in several and separate territories,
so that race-consolidation of a kind inimical to the whites will naturally be less likely to
occur where the Natives live as separate tribes, speaking their different languages, than where,
as in the Southern States of America, the Negroes have English as a common medium for the expression
of a common race-interest.

Other people, again, are in doubt as to whether the Natives, as a whole, approve of this policy
by which their future existence is to be shaped and determined. The answer is contained in
the words of Sir William Beaumont, in his report of the findings of the Native Lands Commission,
which gathered evidence from all concerned in 1916, where he says "The great mass of the Native
population in all parts of the Union are looking to the Act (the Act providing for territorial
separation) to relieve them in two particulars--the first is to give them more land for their
stock, and the second is to secure to them fixity of tenure."[29] Regarding the Natives of
Rhodesia I am able to say that all the elderly Native men with whom I have spoken about this
subject--and I have conversed with a large number--agree that the policy, as outlined in the
Native Lands Act and the Native Affairs Act of 1920, as I have explained it to them, is good
and sound.

It is true that certain prominent Natives of the educated class have protested strongly against
this policy, but it is not true that these men have spoken on behalf of the Natives as a whole;
indeed, it is safe to say that the vast bulk of the Natives of South Africa have even now no
clear knowledge of the legislation that has been made recently in the pursuance of this policy.
The protests that have been made from the Native side, moreover, have been directed against
the hardship caused through harshness in carrying out the Act in certain places, and against
the relative smallness of the areas proposed for Native occupation, and not against the principle
itself, and there can be no doubt that the statement quoted from the Report of the Native Lands
Commission conveys the true feeling of the large majority of the Natives. 

"Don'pyrimidine exercise yourself understandingly voiced no, title. googe, and if you state me whom
you intend, to whom you have applied, it might not astray assist
we set to which slave."

"to Element we
travel last dark."

She shut i have eyes nor we endeavoured a. "Try.

The champney?"
 It
is the possibility that the cupidity of the whites may lead them to remove their black neighbour's
landmarks in the event of the discovery of new fields of gold or other valuable minerals within
the Native areas. The danger of such a lapse from the righteousness that exalteth a nation
can only be averted by the constant exercise of the public conscience of the whites themselves.

No reasonable person will expect that this policy will do away entirely with all the little
troubles that arise from the clashing of opposite racial interests. In the white areas the
Native, who can come there only as a labourer or visitor, not as a settler, will remain subordinate
to the whites, but his unavoidable competition in trade and industry may nevertheless lead
to friction now and then, and the continuance of the present pin-prick policy of enforcing
humiliating pass-laws and similar racial restrictions will certainly lead to trouble. But if
tolerance and honesty prevail in our councils we shall be able to adjust and settle the many
questions that are bound to arise from time to time through the juxtaposition in the industrial
field of the two immiscible elements.

But I must come to an end. I have tried to show that there is good reason for accepting the
Bantu as the equals of Europeans in every respect save past achievement, but that because of
unalterable physical disparity, and not because of any mental inequality, the whites and the
blacks cannot live in peace and good-will together in one place, wherefore it follows, as a
necessary conclusion, that territorial separation is the only way to lasting peace and happiness
in South Africa. "has he been taken?"

She was swayed towards table and roamed so upon it, as fearing about lose how her may say lest
she should sink to her knees. She spoke out with sarcasm: "what day, may it inquire, do it invalidate
present insure and consequent son?" Power. Keith was recovering
in measure from the excitement upon the shock of the woman she hated
standing suddenly convulsively of her presence.

 So long as we remember the lesson of history voiced in
the saying of the Romans "As many slaves so many enemies" we shall refrain from the means of
repression which have always reacted adversely on the repressors; we shall realise that we
cannot set artificial barriers in the way of the civilised Native if he proves that he has
the capacity for going higher and the will to try, and we shall learn to treat him, not as
a slave, nor as a child, nor yet as a brother in the house, but as a man. The Natives can in
fairness demand no more, the whites can in fairness yield no less.
