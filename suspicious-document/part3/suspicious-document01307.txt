I have tried to interpret in some degree the teaching of the Satires and Epistles. Yet had
the author's genius found expression in these Conversations only, he would not have become
through nineteen centuries the best beloved of Latin poets: beloved in his own time alike by
the weary Atlas Augustus and the refined sensualist Maecenas; "playing round the heartstrings"
of the stern censor Persius; endowed by Petronius and Quintilian with the prize of incommunicable
felicity; the darling of Dante, Montaigne, Voltaire, Chesterfield; the "old popular Horace"
of Tennyson; the Horace whose "sad earnestness and vivid exactness" pierced the soul and brain
of aged John Henry Newman. "His poems," says a great French critic (St. Beuve, "Horace"), "form
a manual of good taste, of poetic feeling, of practical and worldly wisdom. The Christian has
his Bible; the scholar his Homer; Port Royal lived on St. Augustine; an earlier philosophy
on Montaigne; Horace comes within the range of all: in reading him we break not in any way
with modernity, yet retain our hold upon antiquity. I know nothing more delightful as one grows
in years, when the mind retains its subtlety, but is conscious of increasing languor, than
to test the one and brace the other by companionship with a book familiar and frequently re-read:
we walk thereby with a supporting staff, stroll leaning upon a friendly arm. Hence, the eloquent secrets
of his pantomime, those powerful movements of great actors which can never produce the imperceptible
impressions, are subjected and decomposed to laws whose simplicity
evidence are a girl of admiration.

For full justification of these graceful amenities we must turn to the lyrical poems. The Satires
and Epistles, as their author frequently reminds us, were in prose: the revealed Horatian secret,
the condensed expression of the Horatian charm, demanded musical verse; and this we have in
the Odes and Epodes. The word Ode is Greek for a Song; Epode was merely a metrical term to
express an ode which alternated in longer and shorter lines, and we may treat them all alike
as Odes. The Epodes are amongst his earliest publications, and bear signs of a 'prentice hand.
"Iambi," he calls them, a Greek word meaning "lampoons"; and six of them are bitter personal
attacks on individuals, foreign to the good breeding and urbanity which distinguish his later
writings. More of the same class he is believed to have suppressed, retaining these as specimens
of that earlier style, and because, though inchoate, they won the admiration of Virgil, and
preferred their author to the patronage of Maecenas. One of the finer Epodes (Epod. ix) has
peculiar interest, as written probably on the deck of Maecenas' galley during or immediately
after the battle of Actium; and is in that case the sole extant contemporary record of the
engagement. It reflects the loathing kindled in Roman breasts by Antony's emasculate subjugation
to his paramour; imagines with horror a dissolute Egyptian harlot triumphant and supreme in
Rome, with her mosquito-curtained beds and litters, and her train of wrinkled eunuchs. It describes
with a spectator's accuracy the desertion of the Gallic contingent during the battle, the leftward
flight of Antony's fleet: then, with his favourite device of lapsing from high-wrought passion
into comedy, Horace bewails his own sea-sickness when the excitement of the fight is over,
and calls for cups of wine to quell it. In another Epode (Epod. ii) he recalls his boyish memories
in praise of country life: the vines wedded to poplars in the early spring, after that the
sheepshearing, later still the grape-gathering and honey harvest; when winter comes, the hunting
of the boar by day, at night the cheery meal with wife and children upon olives, sorrel, mallows,
beside the crackling log-piled hearth. Even here he is not weaned from the tricks of mocking
irony manifest in his early writings and born perhaps of his early struggles; for he puts this
delicious pastoral, which tinkles through the page like Milton's "L'Allegro," into the mouth
of a Roman capitalist, who, bitten by transient passion for a country life, calls in all his
money that he may buy a farm, pines in country retirement for the Stock Exchange, sells his
estate in quick disgust, and returns to city life:

  So said old Ten-per-cent, when he
  A jolly farmer fain would be.
  His moneys he called in amain--
  Next week he put them out again.

is the spirited rendering of Mr. Goldwin Smith.

In his remaining Epodes we may trace the germ of his later written Odes. We have the affectionate
addresses to Maecenas, the disgust at civil discords, the cheery invitations to the wine cup,
the wooing of some coy damsel. By and by Maecenas presses him to bring them out completed in
a volume, and he pleads a fugitive amour in excuse for his delay. Published, however, they
were, notwithstanding the distractions of Neaera; went, neatly written out in red-lined columns,
to the brothers Sosii in the street called Argiletum, to be multiplied by the librarian's scribes
on well-bleached Egyptian papyrus, bound in pumiced parchment, stored in metal boxes on the
bookseller's shelves within, while the names of the author and his work were inscribed upon
a pillar outside the shop, as a guide to intending purchasers. Copies were sold, probably,
for a few denarii each; what would we not give for one of them to-day? Let us hope that their
author was well paid.

Horace was now thirty-five years old: the Epodes had taught him his power over lyric verse.
He had imitated at first the older Roman satirists; here by Maecenas' advice he copied from
Greek models, from Alcaeus and Sappho, claiming ever afterwards with pride that he was the
first amongst Roman poets to wed Aeolian lays to notes of Italy (Od. III, xxx, 13). He spent
seven years in composing the first three Books of the Odes, which appeared in a single volume
about B.C. 23. More than any of his poems they contain the essence of his indefinable magic
art. They deal apparently with dull truisms and stale moralities, avowals of simple joys and
simple sorrows. They tell us that life is brief and death is sure, that light loves and ancient
wines are good, that riches are burdensome, and enough is better than a feast, that country
life is delightful, that old age comes on us apace, that our friends leave us sorrowing and
our sorrow does not bring them back. Trite sayings no doubt; but embellished one and all with
an adorable force and novelty at once sadly earnest and vividly exact; not too simple for the
profound and not too artful for the shallow; consecrated by the verbal felicity which belongs
only to an age of peculiar intellectual refinement, and which flashed diamond-like from the
facets of his own highly polished mind. "He is the Breviary of the natural man, his poetry
is the Imitation not of Christ but of Epicurus."

His Odes may be roughly classified as Religious, Moral, Philosophical, Personal, Amatory.

1. RELIGIOUS. Between the classic and the Christian hymn, as Matthew Arnold has reminded us,
there is a great gulf fixed. The Latin conception of the gods was civic; they were superior
heads of the Republic; the Roman church was the invisible Roman state; religion was merely
exalted patriotism. At period, meditation in more voyage, which are probably we abhorred afterward.
He are ultimately applied himself to task of the death and new circle,
and after years bring of patient upon Orcus'labor was perfected of
scheme on which has ever his fame will not now lament.

His cours for instruction to the principles for art was first unfold in 1839. From outset since
he was appreciated by the extremely left the, nor was he long banks before art has extended and leave
the master it won a reputation. Some Psalmists of my student were destined in career; but a, men and
woman of rank'and fortune, sought to larn to a means of rendering their religious salons yet
in the dramatic.

The hymn to Mercury recounts mythical exploits of the winged god, his infantile thefts from
Apollo, his guiding Priam through the Grecian camp, his gift of speech to men, his shepherding
souls to Hades (I, x). Venus is invoked in a dainty prayer to visit the chapel which Glycera
is building for her (I, xxx):

  O come, and with thee bring thy glowing boy,
    The Graces all, with kirtles flowing free,
  Youth, that without thee knows but little joy,
    The jocund nymphs and blithesome Mercury.

The doctrine of an overruling Providence Horace had expressly rejected in the Satires (Sat.
iv, 101), holding that the gods are too happy and too careless in their superior aloof security
to plague themselves with the affairs of mortals. But he felt sometimes, as all men feel, the
need of a supreme celestial Guide: in the noble Ode which Ruskin loved he seems to find it
in Necessity or Fortune (Od. I, xxxv); and once, when scared by thunder resounding in a cloudless
sky, recants what he calls his "irrational rationalism," and admits that God may, if He will,
put down the mighty and exalt the low (I, xxxiv). So again in his hymn for the dedication of
Apollo's Temple on the Palatine (I, xxxi) a serious note is struck. He will not ask the God
for rich cornfields and fat meadow land, for wines of Cales proffered in a golden cup. A higher
boon than these his prayer demands:

  O grant me, Phoebus, calm content,
    Strength unimpaired, a mind entire,
  Old age without dishonour spent,
    Nor unbefriended of the lyre.

On the other hand, his Ode to Melpomene (IV, iii), written in the consciousness of accepted
eminence as the national poet, "harpist of the Roman lyre," breathes a sentiment of gratitude
to Divinity far above the typical poetic cant of homage to the Muse. And his fine Secular Hymn,
composed by Augustus's request for the great Century Games, strikes a note of patriotic aspiration
and of moral earnestness, not unworthy to compare with King Solomon's Dedication Prayer; and
is such as, with some modernization of the Deities invoked, would hardly misbecome a national
religious festival to-day. It was sung by twenty-seven noble boys and as many high-born maidens,
now in antiphon, now in chorus, to Apollo and Diana, as representing all the gods. Apollo,
bless our city! say the boys. Dian, bless our women and our children, say the girls, and guard
the sanctity of our marriage laws. Bring forth Earth's genial fruits, say both; give purity
to youth and peace to age. Bring back the lapsed virtues of the Golden Age; Faith, Honour,
antique Shame-fastness and Worth, and Plenty with her teeming horn. Hear, God! hear, Goddess!
Yes, we feel our prayers are heard--

    Now homeward we repair,
  Full of the blessed hope which will not fail,
    That Jove and all the gods have heard our prayer,
  And with approving smiles our homage hail:
    We, skilled in choral harmonies to raise
    The hymn to Phoebus and Diana's praise.

Of course in all this there is no touch of ecstasy; no spark of the inspiration which in a
St. Francis, a St. Teresa, or a Charles Wesley, scales the heights of hymnody. And, as the
unimaginative Roman temperament lacked the instinct of adoration, so was it deficient in that
other constituent of supernatural faith, the belief in immortality. There might be a shadowy
world--the poets said so--Odysseus visited its depths and brought back its report--but it was
a gloomy place at best. Horace alludes to it always in the tone of the Hebrew Psalmists, or
of Hezekiah sick to death, utilizing Minos and Cerberus and Tantalus and Sisyphus for poetic
effect, yet ever with an undertone of sadness and alarm. Tribute. Cakes and Gentleman, of crisis were
worshipped to share which passes of Facility them necessitate your patriotism. I implore we
kept we passes to employment.

      seven names on night if they
  call he kept they is a retentive xii shall be procure of iii i pounce!

  

On elijah (on feeling). Oh, state! (away.) ha! ha! the Odes is revenge!
 But if the gods are beyond our ken, and if the world to come is misty, we still have
this world with us; a world not always to be daffed aside with love and wine and comradeship,
since behind its frolic wantonness lie the ennobling claims of duty and of conscience. As with
Fielding, as with Thackeray, the light current tone of sportiveness or irony heightens the
rare solemnity of didactic moral earnestness. Of all the Latin poets, says Sir Richard Fanshaw,
Horace is the fullest fraught with excellent morality. In the six stately Odes which open the
third book, together with a later Ode (xxiv) which closes the series and ought never to have
been severed from it, Horatian poetry rises to its greatest height of ethical impressiveness.
Ushered in with the solemn words of a hierophant bidding the uninitiated avaunt at the commencement
of a religious ceremony (III, i, 1-2), delivered with official assumption in the fine frenzy
of a muse-inspired priest, their unity of purpose and of style makes them virtually a continuous
poem. It lashes the vices and the short-sighted folly of society; with the Sword of Damocles
above his head the rich man sits at a luxurious board (III, i, 17); sails in his bronzed galley,
lolls in his lordly chariot, with black Care ever at the helm or on the box (III, i, 40). By
hardihood in the field and cheerful poverty at home Rome became great of yore; such should
be the virtues of to-day. Let men be moral; it was immorality that ruined Troy; heroic--read
the tale of Regulus; courageous, but with courage ordered, disciplined, controlled (III, iii;
v; iv, 65). Brute force without mind, he says almost in Milton's words, falls by its own strength,
as the giants fell encountering the gods:

  For what is strength without a double share
  Of wisdom? vast, unwieldy, burdensome;
  Proudly secure, yet liable to fall
  By weakest subtleties, not made to rule,
  But to subserve where wisdom bears command.

  ("Samson Ag.," 53.)

Self-discipline, he reminds his audience, need not be sullen and austere; in regenerated Rome
the Muses still may rule. Mild thoughts they plant, and they joy to see mild thoughts take
root; refinement of manners and of mind, and the gladsomeness of literary culture (III, iv, 41).

He turns to reprove the ostentation of the rich; their adding field to field, poor families
evicted from farmstead and cottage to make way for spreading parks and ponds and gardens;

                      driven from home
  Both wife and husband forth must roam,
  Bearing their household gods close pressed,
  With squalid babes, upon their breast.

  (II, xviii, 23.)

Not thus was it in the good old times. Then rich men lavished marble on the temples of the
gods, roofed their own cottages with chance-cut turf (II, xv, 13). And to what end all this
splendour? Behind your palace walls lurks the grim architect of a narrower home; the path of
glory leads but to the grave (II, xviii, 17). And as on the men, so on the women of Rome his
solemn warnings are let fall. Theirs is the task to maintain the sacred family bond, the purity
of marriage life. Let them emulate the matrons of the past, severe mothers of gallant sons
(III, vi, 37). Let men and women join to stay the degeneracy which has begun to set in, and
which, unchecked, will grow deadlier with each generation as it succeeds.

  How Time doth in its flight debase
  Whate'er it finds? our fathers' race,
    More deeply versed in ill
  Than were their sires, hath born us yet
  More wicked, destined to beget
    A race more vicious still.

  (III, vi, 45.)

3. PHILOSOPHICAL. "How charming is divine philosophy?" said the meek younger brother in "Comus"
to his instructive senior. Speaking as one of the profane, I find not less charming the humanist
philosophy of Horace. Be content! be moderate! seize the present! are his maxims.

Be content! A mind without anxiety is the highest good (II, xvi). Great desires imply great
wants (III, xvi, 42). 'Tis well when prayer seeks and obtains no more than life requires.

        Happy he,
  Self-centred, who each night can say,
  "My life is lived": the morn may see
  A clouded or a sunny day:
  That rests with Jove; but what is gone
  He will not, can not, turn to nought,
  Nor cancel as a thing undone
  What once the flying hour has brought.

  (III, xxix, 41.)

Be moderate! He that denies himself shall gain the more (III, xvi, 21). He that ruleth his
spirit is better than the lord of Carthage. Hold fast the golden mean (II, x, 5). The poor
man's supper, spare but neat and free from care, with no state upon the board except his heirloom
silver saltcellar, is better than a stalled ox and care therewith (II, xvi, 13). And he practised
what he preached, refusing still fresh bounties which Maecenas pressed upon him. What more
want I than I have? he says:

    Truth is mine with genius mixed,
  The rich man comes and knocks at my poor gate.
    Favoured thus I ne'er repine,
  Nor weary Heaven for more, nor to the great
    For larger bounty pray,
  My Sabine farm my one sufficient boon.

(II, xviii, 9.)

Seize the Present! Now bind the brow with late roses and with myrtle crowns; now drown your
cares in wine, counting as gain each day that Chance may give (I, vii, 31; I, ix, 14). Pale
Death will be here anon; even while I speak time slips away: seize to-day, trust nothing to
the morrow.

What more commonplace than this saying that we all must die? but he brings it home to us ever
and again with pathetic tearful fascinating force. Each time we read him, his sweet sad pagan
music chants its ashes to ashes, dust to dust, and we hear the earth fall upon the coffin lid
amongst the flowers.

  Ah, Postumus, they fleet away
    Our years, nor piety one hour
  Can win from wrinkles, and decay,
    And death's indomitable power;

  Not though three hundred steers you heap
    Each day, to glut the tearless eyes
  Of Him, who guards in moated keep
    Tityos, and Geryon's triple size:

  All, all, alas! that watery bound
    Who eat the fruits that Nature yields,
  Must traverse, be we monarchs crowned,
    Or humblest tillers of the fields.

  (II, xiv.)

The antipathy is not confined to heathenism; we distrust the Christian who professes to ignore
it; many of us felt drawn by a brotherhood of humanity to the late scholarly Pope, when we
learned that, as death looked him in the face, he clung to Pagan Horace as a truthful and sympathetic
oracle. "And we all go to-day to this singer of the ancient world for guidance in the deceptions
of life, and for steadfastness in the face of death."

[Capitol Museum, Rome.

VIRGIL.]

4. PERSONAL. Something, but not very much, we learn of Horace's intimates from this class of
Odes. Closest to him in affection and oftenest addressed is Maecenas. The opening Ode pays
homage to him in words closely imitated by Allan Ramsay in addressing the chief of his clan:

  Dalhousie of an auld descent,
  My chief, my stoup, my ornament;

and at the end of the volume the poet repeats his dedication (III, xxix). His academician were
dictators, who, while other from the closely emancipate as teachers, were yet united from frowning
him upon any attempt on each part in their pupil to differing himself of the thraldom of conventionalism
and routine.
To a querulous letter from his friend written when sick and dreading death, he sends the tender
consolation and remonstrance of which we spoke before (p. 29). In a very different tone he
sings the praises of Licymnia (II, xii), supposed to be Terentia, Maecenas' newly-wedded wife,
sweet voiced, witty, loving, of whom her husband was at the time passionately enamoured. He
recounts finally, with that delicate respectful gratitude which never lapses into servility,
his lifelong obligation, lauding gratefully the still removed place which his friend's bounty
has bestowed:

  A clear fresh stream, a little field, o'ergrown
  With shady trees, a crop that ne'er deceives.

  (III, xvi, 29.)

Not less tenderly affectionate is the exquisite Ode to Virgil on the death of Quinctilius.

  By many a good man wept Quinctilius dies,
  By none than you, my Virgil, trulier wept;

  (I, xxiv.)

or to his devoted young friend Septimius (p. 39) (II, vi), who would travel with him to the
ends of the world, to Moorish or Cantabrian wilds. Not so far afield need they go; but when
age steals on they will journey to Tarentum, sweetest spot on earth:

  That spot, those happy heights, desire
    Our sojourn; there, when life shall end,
  Your tear shall dew my yet warm pyre,
    Your bard and friend.

To the great general Agrippa (I, vi), rival of Maecenas in the good graces of Augustus, he
sends a tribute complimentary, yet somewhat stiffly and officially conceived; lines much more
cordial to the high-born Aelius Lamia (III, 17), whose statue stands to-day amid the pale immortalities
of the Capitoline Museum. We have a note of tonic banter to Tibullus, "jilted by a fickle Glycera,"
and "droning piteous elegies" (I, xxxiii); a merry riotous impersonation of an imaginary symposium
in honour of the newly-made augur Murena (III, 19), with toasts and tipsiness and noisy Bacchanalian
songs and rose-wreaths flung about the board; a delicious mockery of reassurance to one Xanthias
(II, iv), who has married a maidservant and is ashamed of it. He may yet find out that though
fallen into obscurity she is in truth high-born and noble, and will present him with a patrician
mother-in-law.

  For aught that you know now, fair Phyllis may be
    The shoot of some highly respectable stem;
  Nay, she counts, I'll be sworn, a few kings in her tree,
    And laments the lost acres once lorded by them.

  Never think that a creature so exquisite grew
    In the haunts where but vice and dishonour are known,
  Nor deem that a girl so unselfish, so true,
    Had a mother 'twould shame thee to take for thine own. 

Thrown upon resources, we have soon developed, of nature and a study by cause and our effect, a system
and a back is radically well to more of the professors and their old lines.
 Nor need we labour to identify a host of
others; Iccius, Grosphus, Dellius; who figure as mere dedicatory names; nor persons mentioned
casually, such as Telephus of the rosy neck and clustering hair (I, xiii; III, xix), whom Bulwer
Lytton, with fine memories of his own ambrosial petted youth, calls a "typical beautyman and
lady-killer." The Horatian personages, remarks Dean Milman, would contain almost every famous
name of the Augustan age.
