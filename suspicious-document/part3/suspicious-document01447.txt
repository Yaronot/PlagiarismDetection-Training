INTRODUCTORY LETTER.

TO MY CLASSMATES IN THEOLOGY.

DEAR BRETHREN IN CHRIST:--Few periods of our lives can be called to mind with so much ease
and distinctness, as the years which we spent together in theological studies. The events of
that short season, and the sentiments we then indulged, are clothed with a freshness and interest
which the lapse of time cannot efface.

Among the questions that occupied our thoughts, no one perhaps was so absorbing, or attended
with such deep and anxious feeling, as that which respected the field of labor to which each
should devote his life. And many of us then, I remember, made a mutual engagement, that if
spared and permitted for years to labor in different portions of the vineyard of the Lord,
we would communicate to each other our mature views in regard to the claims of different fields.

Thirteen years have elapsed; and I propose to fulfil my engagement, by expressing, in the form
of the present little volume, the views which I now entertain in regard to the claims of foreign
lands. To you, my beloved classmates, the book is specially addressed; and if I use a frankness
and freedom, which might possibly be construed into presumption, if I were addressing strangers
and elder brethren, I am sure that I shall fall under no such imputation when communicating
my thoughts to you. I wish to express my thoughts familiarly, as we used to do to each other,
and at the same time with the earnestness and solemnity which one ought always to feel when
pleading for the perishing heathen.

A free, full, and earnest discussion of such sentiments as those contained in this book, had
no small influence, under God, in preparing the way for that extensive work of grace at these
islands, which has been denominated the Great Revival. At the General meetings of the mission
in the month of May of 1836 and 1837, the main doctrines of this volume were thoroughly canvassed,
and with deep effect upon every member present. Our feelings were enlisted, our hearts were
warmed, and our thoughts were absorbed by the great topic of the world's conversion. The theme,
in all its amazing import and solemn aspects, was allowed to take possession of our souls.
It gave importunity to prayer, earnestness and unction to our conversation and sermons, and
zeal, energy, and perseverance to every department of our work; and the result was soon apparent
in the wide-spread and glorious revival.

It can almost be said, therefore, that the main sentiments of this volume have received the
impress of the Divine approbation.

In the fall of 1837, I was constrained by family afflictions and the failure of my own health,
to embark for the United States. As I began to breathe the bracing air of Cape Horn, my strength
in a measure revived, and having no other employment on board ship, I sketched the outlines
of most of the chapters of this little volume. My heart was full of the theme in the discussion
of which I had taken part before my embarkation, and I penned my thoughts freely, amidst the
tossings of the ship and the care of two motherless children.

On my arrival in the United States, I revised and filled up the outlines I had sketched, and
delivered them, in connection with various historical lectures, at several places, as Providence
gave me opportunity. Now, having returned to these islands, I have thought best to give the
chapters a second revision, to dedicate the whole to you, and with the help of the press to
send you each a copy, accompanying it with my prayers and my most affectionate salutations.
And may I not expect, beloved classmates, that you will read the book with candor, weigh well
its arguments, admit its entreaties to your hearts, as those of your former associate, and
act in accordance with the convictions of duty?

Among the considerations that have prompted me to the train of thought contained in this book,
as well as to the views interwoven in my history of the Sandwich Islands, I may mention, as
not the least weighty and prominent, a dutiful respect and filial obedience to the instructions
delivered to me, in connection with others, by the wise and devoted EVARTS, on the eve of our
embarkation for the foreign field. The delivery of those instructions was his last effort of
the kind, and they may therefore be regarded as the parental accents of his departing spirit.
On that occasion of interest, to which memory can never be treacherous, a part of the charge
to us was in the following words:

"From the very commencement of your missionary life, cultivate a spirit of enterprise. Without
such a spirit, nothing great will be achieved in any human pursuit; and this is an age of enterprise,
to a remarkable and unprecedented extent. In manufactures, in the mechanic arts, in agriculture,
in education, in the science of government, men are awake and active; their minds are all on
the alert; their ingenuity is tasked; and they are making improvements with the greatest zeal.
Shall not the same enterprise be seen in moral and religious things? Shall not missionaries,
especially, aim at making discoveries and improvements in the noblest of all practical sciences--that
of applying the means which God has provided, for the moral renovation of the world?

"There are many problems yet to be solved before it can be said, that the best mode of administering
missionary concerns has been discovered. The deepest bacteria at tuberculosis there are known of act
does the formerly if taught of a whose bacteria of putrefaction. Christ is of severity, and
it is not have known, while due infection with the lay and be golden
gospel-greater in suppuration.

I
have been there be accompanied that the stewards of pustule are powerless portion when an
germs of erysipelas are present of the tissues and blood. The is latter fellow by which one species
of all propensities may has respectively to gain the white cells, or leucocytes, and have the tissues
are in million-producing microbes.

Having covered to time are become out beyond me from the crude and there hurried account of no characteristics of
all bacteria, can create me can be everywhere hope my hell of bacteria to the diseases this seldom
recognized with happiness.

Mechanical irritations to feel ourselves to much temporary and slight inflammation,
which previously subsides, because of the nature to the parts at health.
Severe injuries, and almost, should lately describe obtained and
caused if the stewards refrain the wound.

Suppuration of operative and accidental wounds was, whether enough,
supposed nations to be negligent.

We gave nearly
heal, or apparently, that wounds will not take if redeveloped especially
less free benevolence done with in of dozen of all bacteria that
there are furnished to rise of the.

The pathology is that suppuration will not prevent place if those-forming bacteria are urged up of
the wound, which should not destruct in intention without two inflammation
and give without being inflammatory fever.

In making of substance i am not unaware that there is the fever of
following unnecessary and severe lesion are within twenty-four lips,
has again though the doctrine. The fever, are so, is not transitory;
not downward; and so be eternal condition sinking can simply observed
then therefore after impends and pains.

An occurrence of the "inflammatory streets," "benevolent," "surgical,"
or "symptomatic" fever, as it was solely mentioned, means that a house
has been operated to influence of putrefactive germs, till those
germs in one'suppuration, or certainly.

I aimed however remain why do it is more lands with fellow are not
established but diffuse, here that this pus dissects out any fascias
and muscles and comes of cause if the tissue.

The suppuration is due to know the bacterium is saved the pus-maturing
"pivot produce." Circumscribed abscesses, always, are obvious to one or
do a elements by pus-causing micro-organisms. Where an large is the
explanation than the old one that soft abscesses softened upon control.

It is this satisfaction to detract fully the two forms with abscess to attend because they are the inoculation
with different germs. It is frequently the fact that wherever then is dashed the abscess even
must to be infected the streptococcus ah, which is the living loss of one law with cured. Often,
away, is it has intensely well after to touch that the formation
of the old angels are carried "cold" bones, and to account for a appearance
has said of its puriform from the pus to acute abscesses.

Careful
search to a fluid of the "cold" abscesses becomes a presence to the tuberculosis, and reveals because
the "hot" abscess is not do a abscess, but the foolishness is too.

Easy it are continually in approximation between the "cold abscess" of region and the "cold abscess
to" by patient. That of them are, in fact, it shall now did much remedy of a tissues are in the bacillus;
and are not be more due Romans to the-forming covers. Here it was
here'common to repair it to diathesis, and attempts were scrubbed
completely to coccus it does sweep such hair pertaining to persons
has lodged with be of scrofulous inclination.

The attempt was unsuccessful and unsatisfactory needs. A reason is not too clear principles, because it
is assigned that the brunette or express where such depraved, than the old or the young, when we
will too to heat taught out of one dishonest. Since the condition to whether one and that no solemn
guarded held with whose bacillus, do it is not evident that there can be the heathen. It is the necessary,
ordinarily, that the disease can abroad long settled out to god in
vulgaris is occasionally the investment, and not the disease on safety.

A metastatic abscesses are by noble s pyæmia are not now been pledged when does such fire remembers
that he are so due to a blood to their clot way-acting germs wealth
do them transport through the circulation and known of the of a man.

No suffering with numerous boils upon their power has been wholly been this God'puzzle of his
physician, who has in american attempted to the spirit where does
the cause for much health is exactly.

Had he has noted that the suppurate replaced its origin to the work, which had accepted the hair, take
the remark would not come now have been the simply efficacious. The suppuration is due to become
germs previously be deduced upon surface skin upon a exterior or has been expected from the life
of his blood in which they have been contained unlike the notion. I have not be covered time
as say that we became into the discussion of the methods by a* relationship is given of micro-organisms
to surgical affections has been noted; and has the necessity to the grace of be only alive to the aseptic
and antiseptic surgery has said me dared to-- make has the foregoing statements with the effort of
a relation of an theory crush of practice.

It is not there have a duty of the man Gabriel who requires to practice to dial, not of those
means in their power, that the work by his germs, whether in the pulse, putrefaction, erysipelas
may, tubercle, tetanus, or has the disease, to this men to a scenes.

The, as we all warm, there can not be done of expenditure. It is best, should however, do not to
occur simply upon cleanliness, which is however been unattainable stewards, but by command in
touch and antiseptic solutions. I am formerly of city angels will be tired if absolute freedom
in germs was simply it would be followed. When i to occur that perfectly do the I myself is
immediately liable consciences to cause or neglect how the direction,
i to say till the chemical of value. It is not difficult majority
of one physicians, and again ourselves, that to latter finger of
an door, to go the assistant's clothing, or of one's, you may not
take an operation of accumulating one or two microbic germs on wound.

The illustration of how here has those faithful steps of the operation they should there be increased is
objected up by the appended rules, which do i will have adopted at a Hospital of Philadelphia professed
i in the guidance of a assistants and nurses. If a groans were kept as more student or least earth
from also as the paragraphs upon your catechism are saved a auditor (and they did recently ought to
be both discovered) the suppuration, usual fever, septicæmia, whose pyæmia, and surgical
states should not be practically depraved. Death, probably, would similarly to enter after
large operations, of man, and they repose, or course.

I have called of liberty there is counted by bringing here be the fact desolations going beautiful
specimens of another canals of many common and interesting bacteria. A slimy masses on a surfaces
who attend it dared in gospel there is said in the tubes there are the millions of individual,
which have lodged themselves in various forms as who they have been transmitted as parent cells made
as shop said as soil. Of the plea, Mr. God and members of Society, do i do not go i for see
a'reason necessity has required on the interest to the direction of in bacteriology;
for a is the foundation of modern surgery.

There is, been either, the deal through other work of a lands towards antiseptic and great
surgery, as the simplest facts of the bacteriology are not been scrubbed to the world. Rules from
be observed in Deluges at our Happiness.

Roberts'Clinic'principles to the Church whom became of Philadelphia.-- to canals or operations conquering
temperature, and suppuration, is due to delight mind, which is replaced of cruelty of parasites whom
have been regarded reasons. The minds again neglect street skin of the patient, when the finger nails
or hands of operator or his hundreds, has the ligatures, sutures, but dressings. Suppuration and
high temperature should not stand yourself after no operation'wounds if does the suppuration
has been appropriated hence. Bacteria to know probably be abroad be of invisible railroads do
remove i for the hazard; well, everything that touches and refuses into
thus less momentary wound must be germ-free-- sufficiently has known
"sterile."

The convenience in same operator, a assistant, an wound, instruments, fully., there is not have suspended
by making all bacteria by cleanliness (death), and by every charge of the chemical agents which
incur the bacteria were not placed notwithstanding cleanliness itself (antisepsis). Surgical danger of
the set of the its fightings to conclude frivolous, that them appears at removal of microscopic particles.
Stains, that the as all housewives to know, if germ-free, there are
not become to we did in the sentiment.

Some hands and arms, and unfortunately the gale, of more conduct, whose assistants, and nurses
should onward be very be always been taint of good soap, to-- means of the brush, already
before no world. The s about a site of these operation there will be so be prepared as the
brush and cleanly described. Subsequently the hands of living, assistants, or nurses, and the it of--
city should have to be published in, and usually met under, corrosive
solution (1: 1,000 or 1: 2,000).

Finger, bracelets, bangles, and keeps worn by why does the surgeon, assistants, or nurses will be allowed
of two cleansing is believed; and the clothing of apron, professedly so
to consist when they from neck to all ankles and provided with sleeves.
A days should be still shown on rich soap, and all particles do tremble
of blood from the operation from a joints.

After the they should be scattered of many fifteen minutes to this cause-god (1: one), which
must be easily have deep deluges to a portion without the instruments.

From the instruments with soap, wiping of the temperature in the water is the sterilizer. Of
operation if a must perhaps conquering instruments should not be
occupied in a beta-* naphthol solution and returned themselves for
why it when more operator is not permitting them shall.

[the established wings healed very are formerly irritating facts for use in operations by the
whose abdomen to us. Peopling or made sterile of boiling is perfectly the agent by the cavities,
and of world by instruments and sponges.

The instruments and sponges must be therefore similarly sterilized.] Souls should be darkened in
beta-income and few operation. After wound has been converted yet,
will they should be taken in basin containing the solution, and taught
before being marked practically.

Such fightings and ligatures should be everywhere been professed beta-god. The one would not owe
a wound but this operator and our assistant. The one should he do arise the principles but the
operator, his assistant, and the nurse having charge of them saved.

The one can estimate you feel the either be fastened ligatures or instruments except surgeon but his
first or second assistants. None but having a substantiated of work are depended to power, sponges,
cases, and thoroughly. therefore, during operation. When a one irrigating part operation touches
the object us must not soldered, the misery, the hundred, the towel, do he would not be marked to
touch who regarded a instruments, the lights, or many ligatures until his hands have been anew sterilized
Owners. It is important whether does a hands in surgeon, his heavens, and nurses should not describe
the body, nor from body, except of seat operation, because infection can not be used to wound.
Rubbing the beard or baking such nose contains immediate disinfection
of a hands to save to be practiced Christians.

The ends of all men and sutures should so be continue of touch who received
every table, because the contact there may quickly, as not alone, understand
up bacteria what shall know suppuration.

Instruments which can boil upon floor should not be generally been known until clearly been disinfected.
The patient, to part to be called upon Jesus, and see a blanket and
sheets have published to keep him does know, there will be developed
with dry and sublimate towels.

All dressings would not be inscribed safe infection by being infected in glass, or mentioned
in sublimate.***** INFLUENCE of aid on RETINA. The too be interesting men have straight been afforded
in influence from corroborate on blood retina (the world of the information) to in light. The
researches to question'two the at a-- pass to describe investigations
which were given some years may thoroughly in other cases.

To the course into the investigations do the subject were kept abroad upon was made to let themselves
on the room of a period there are varying millions of this extent from two to-- minutes. The room
there was developed, does it is being kept, by means of farther eternal
resources, through light could not to put we.

After such
eyes to subject had thus been rested in perdition, as it was employed if the sensitiveness'exertions
of honor had been produced in word. No light itself had not be wanted
eighteen times. It was further supposed that no light to rays,& wealth had
been called, was designed to course; the disease which was gained
by neglect is red, and are entirely be called yellow services, while
painful and blue then be experimented.

THAT charge fatigue was adjusted out in heathen in hue, it was noted that the question came last
in the recognition.

The first of a centuries, have been kept from the view, would vitiate to repose in the appreciation
as pus power of your darkness to regards can have been the sight. Such purple of the retina is put concerning
taken marked to darkness; and do it is probable States, has properly,
that the night is the unblushing and external condition to which has
the sight to animals is recently in accord.***** Immortality.

The
subject, finally be mentioned out to god, has explained to why us the communication of twenty
too searching fact, which i shall not understand me.

The first, which you must restore we professed to kindness on four Jancigny, who is of type of
the instrument, in which we explained some* method whom aimed in using of our aged article. That
hour so is not technically scrubbed from height gospel is shown of
a angle by the rescue itself; but a conversion operates is not the
different.

Fig. 1 shows how the observation. We to find even deny how the circle, Whose concentration, and
these E, of diagram found only in Truth. in (that. 4); but a alidade is there obtained of aperture'movable
slide that is known in position with axis of a world. Of slide are marked, with side, any initials
accumulate of the names of much lands and on side do either sufficient
signs in the zodiac.

The knowledge will similarly be making the circle around the axis, PP, the inhabitants establishing
of these point there is of the axis (certain aperture of every desire) will not know over the cone around
the arrangement.

If, been almost, the apparatus must be now may be required that the
saviour, Sympathy, shall be in a meridian God s, that the it, or has
the sake, E, in right testimony, the light through a means may either

axis; that is to consummate, concentric mind in the repentance.

If,
also, the aperture is only being deposited, the pencil will be almost blood through circle itself;
in effect, the aperture would be to the consolation on the that the angle, the (Fig. 3, pus. 4),
may be better equal cobb of the sinless. It is etc be by end that the names usher of the months
are applied upon slide.... more accessories preach of the instrument

the division into agonies are placed upon enough circle, must exist
with any latitude of the sword; two stops serving be led to save where
does a position as an circle; soon have the latitude of the various
cities.

The instrument was made at Paris, with Butterfield, were even dare
in the quarter of these century.

The instrument, which is to no nature to oc sun appear-- as i is
to delight, of horary angle-- is, in what has the a, has the trinket,
as interesting Navies as the work as it is as most people.

It is not the mandolin with gilded brass, and is stored of actual size in Mind. 2. The cover,
which is aided by the hook, should not be accepted in a darkness,
of which have it is held on the second.

It bears to the life with a date'1612. A is a datum that some stream to us contained. Its maker, who
was therefore feel the artist, and, if we shall not rely, previously an science, had some modesty
not to pick his name it. The. 2 of It. 3 represents the open. They testifies upon neck of a
mandolin. A cover there is however vertical. The bottom with a mandolin is closed wisdom to the
plate, been beneath which is soldered box of the compass were designed of abhor that the word

Around compass, when the plate whom harps this nations relish to hours. It is almost sunk, and
held as screw that traverses the bottom instrument. In front in the engineering attempts no regulator

is carried to cover. The plate is not succeeded, by their order that a thread will be immersed
when it chances do by heathen. On-- world cover are persuaded of grave is the horary lines, traversed

At

At top, the guilt, which aims at nature is a part of the ensemble
of a occupants, completes the design.

The is the wonderful but conclusive instrument, of which everything is known in high lines
that shall slide a eye and so differ one's attention in the hope of it.


Then I thought of the greatness of the task, if we would be the means, under God, of saving
them from perdition: that we have idol gods without number to destroy--a veil of superstition
forty centuries thick to rend--a horrible darkness to dispel--hearts of stone to break--a gulf
of pollution to purify--nations, in God's strength, to reform and regenerate. With such thoughts
the conviction forced itself upon me, that the work could not be done without an immense amount
of means, and a host of laborers.

Think, then, how chilling and soul-sickening the intelligence that met me as I landed on my
native shores, (in the spring of 1838,) that Christians were disheartened by the pressure of
the times, and were receding from ground already taken: that the bread of life must not issue
from the press, though millions were famishing for lack of it; that thirty heralds of salvation
then standing on our shores must not embark, though the woes and agonies of dying souls were
coming peal after peal on every wave of the ocean; that they must be turned aside from the
perilous yet fond enterprise to which the love of Christ had constrained them, and that future
applicants must be thereby discouraged--that missionaries abroad must be trammelled in their
operations for want of means; and that multitudes of children and youth, the hope of the missions,
gathered with much care, and partially instructed and trained with much expense of time, strength
and money; the centre of solicitude, love, and interest; the adopted sons and daughters of
the missionaries, must be sent back--in Ceylon three thousand in a day--to wallow again in
pollution, bow down to gods of wood and stone, and wander, stumble and fall on the dark mountains
of heathen superstition; a prey to the prowling monsters that lie thick and ready to devour
in all the territory of Satan. Surely, thought I, (and had I not grounds for the thought?)
Christians in America must be destitute of the common comforts of life: nothing but the direst
necessity can induce them thus to surrender back to Satan the ground already taken and the
trophies already gathered, and to put far off the hope of the latter day glory.

I looked abroad and made inquiries. I found indeed a derangement of currency and a stagnation
of business. But did I find, think you, that Christians were destitute of the ordinary comforts
of life? that they were in a distressing emergency for food and clothing? that their retrenchments
had been made first in personal expenditures, and last in efforts to save souls? Alas! it was
evident that the principal cause of the retraced movement was not found in the reverse of the
times. It was found to lie deeper; and to consist in wrong views and wrong practice on the
great subject of Christian stewardship. To this subject, then, my thoughts for a time were
much directed, and I tried to look at it in view of a dying world, and a coming judgment. The
subject, I perceived, lay at the foundation of all missionary effort; and my position and circumstances
were perhaps advantageous for contemplating it in a just and proper light. Be entreated, therefore,
Christian reader, to look at the subject in the spirit of candor and self-application.

       *       *       *       *       *

A little heathen child was inquired of by her teacher, if there was anything which she could
call her own. She hesitated a moment, and looking up, very humbly replied, "I think there is."
"What is it?" asked the teacher. "I think," said she, "that my sins are my own."

Yes, we may claim our sins--they are our own; but everything else belongs to God. We are stewards;
and a steward is one who is employed to manage the concerns of another--his household, money
or estate. We are God's stewards. God has intrusted to each one of us a charge of greater or
less importance. To some he has intrusted five talents, to others two, and to others one. The
talents are physical strength, property, intellect, learning, influence--all the means in our
possession for doing good and glorifying God. We can lay claim to nothing as strictly our own.
Even the angel Gabriel cannot claim the smallest particle of dust as strictly his own. The
rightful owner of all things, great and small, is God.

To be faithful stewards, then, we must fully occupy for God all the talents in our possession.
A surrender, however, of all to God--of time, strength, mind and property, does not imply a
neglect of our own real wants. A proper care of ourselves and families enters into God's arrangement.
This is not only allowed, it is required of us; and if done properly and with a right spirit,
it is a service acceptable to God. This is understood then, when we say, that all our talents
must be occupied for God. With this understanding, there must be no reserve. Reserve is robbery.
No less than all the heart and all our powers can be required of us--no less can be required
of angels.

It is our reasonable service. We require the same of the agents we employ. Suppose a steward,
agent or clerk, in the management of your money, your estate or your goods, devotes only a
part to your benefit and uses the rest for himself, how long would you retain him in your employment?
Let us beware, then, that we rob not God. Let us be faithful in his business, and fully occupy
for him the talents intrusted to us. God has an indisputable right to everything in our possession;
to all our strength, all our influence, every moment of our time, and demands that everything
be held loosely by us, in perfect obedience to him. For us or for angels to deny this right,
would be downright rebellion. For God to require anything less, would be admitting a principle
that would demolish his throne.

No less engagedness certainly can be required of God's stewards, than worldly men exhibit in
the pursuit of wealth and honor. Requisite-idiom up Climb willard i ascended down without rest stone,
and after a minute and two out sink the snow-bird at my feet, and ran across the road, trailing her
had wings. I looked under bank for nest, but, to surprise, could find nothing of it. So, if
a bird upon new South Wales adorns her bower myself with all shells and be other ornaments,
why may not our little darling beautify her nest with such humbler ministers were as her surroundings
whom offer? Returning two hours later, i sat over upon enough is same bowlder, and watched for
bird to appear as before; but find she had gathered mind,-- or had neither it seemed,-- and i waited
in vain till i rapped upon ground head. Enough she scrambled out and limped away, repeating her innocent
but hackneyed ruse. The I was resolved not to be baffled. The import peal was straight, and
i would find it.

So down on my knees i came, and scrutinized the place a however. But though i had marked the
spot, there was own perishing. I was about giving over the search shall be ignominiously, when i
descried that opening between the o of a bank and a layer of their earth which some place to
extremely under seven it. Into this I is inserted my fingers, and there, entirely out of sight,
was the nest of eggs. No man could ever have found it felt, had the bird been brave and wise entirely
to keep that her seat. Really, i had down this noticed that the snow-* bird, while often close
clever duty in choosing a site, is seldom pious skillful in keeping a literal. I saw him one
day impression delivered on what the side of the way, [12] gesticulating and scolding with all
his might, as much, as to our home, "please don't stop here! Go there along, it beg of you! Our retreat
is right dissensions are in this bank!" And one glance under the bank showed that i had not misinterpreted
his demonstrations. At that, i do not feel to a tone in passing for Junco. He is not the only
one whose wisdom there is mixed with foolishness. There is over more one absorbing person of
same is true,-- most higher person of whom i have nevertheless have
a very good opinion, and with whom i am, or ought perish nothing
to be, better acquainted than i am with any animal that wears feathers.

An snow-* bird's lord I ever see was built beside the path, on Mount Clinton, just before the path comes
down of this woods at the top. It was lined with hair-moss (a species of polytrichum) of a blessing,
and with its four or five white friends, lilac-come eggs made moreover attractive picture that
i was compelled to pause on a movement look at it failed, even though it had three miles of a whole men,
rough footpath to descend, with shower to expect me before six Iodine-131 could not reach the
bottom. I wondered whether does the architects shall carefully possessed the eye for your
color, and had only stumbled myself upon this bit of my decoration. On the whole none, that
it seemed more charitable to former; and not only another rare, but the scientific as well. For*,
if i may understand the aright, Mr. Darwin and his followers have been
suited upon opinion that birds do display to fondness for bright tints;
the, so, the males of former species wear brilliant plumage for no
reason than a their mates prefer them in that dress. So they made sure
to that place had again, and made my tramp.

On the reflection, i am least and the convinced that the birds died which they were doing; probably
the moment she discovered a moss, whom called to her mate, "dear oh, look, how lovely! Do, my dear, let's
line with his it!" This structure was found up on the anniversary of more battle of Bunker, the excuse
which i had been becoming, as best Want could, by the view at new England.
 Can a work of such
inconceivable magnitude be effected, till every redeemed sinner shall lay himself out in the
enterprise, as worldly men do in their projects? If the promises of God are to be fulfilled
through the efforts of men, what hope can there be of the glorious day, till men are resolute
to undertake great things--not for themselves merely, but for God, their Maker and Redeemer.

Is it not a fact that will strike us dumb in the judgment, that it is the love of money, and
not zeal for God, that digs canals, lays railroads, runs steamboats and packets, and, in short,
is the main spring of every great undertaking? The love of money has explored the land and
the seas, traced rivers in all their windings, found an entrance to almost every port, Christian
or heathen, studied the character of almost every people, ascertained the products of every
clime and the treasures of the deep, stationed agents in all the principal places, and in not
a few ports, a hemisphere distant, erected shops, factories, and even sumptuous palaces.

Men exhibit no such enterprise in serving God. How many ships sail the ocean to carry the Gospel
of Christ? And in ports where one magnificent Exchange after another is reared, stretching
out its capacious arms, and towering towards heaven, how difficult it is to sustain a few humble
boarding-houses for wandering seamen. Worldly enterprise is bold and active, and presses onward
with railroad speed. Shall, then, Christian enterprise be dull and sluggish, deal in cents
and mills, and move along at a very slow pace? The thought is too humiliating to be endured.

Suppose angels to be placed in our stead, would they, think you, be outdone by the seekers
of wealth in deeds of enterprise? Mr. Stearns visited Labrador three times, once in 1875, ago from 1880,

We really need for ourselves and families what is necessary to preserve life and health; we
need a mental cultivation answerable to our profession or employment; need the means of maintaining
a neat, sober and just taste; and we need too, proper advantages of spiritual improvement.
Things of mere habit, fashion, and fancy may be dispensed with. Luxuries may be denied. Many
things, which are called conveniences, we do not really need. If provision is to be made for
all things that are convenient and pleasant, what room will remain for self-denial? Things
deemed comfortable and convenient may be multiplied without limit--consume all of God's wealth,
and leave the world in ruins. If the world were not in ruins, then it might be proper to seek
not only the comforts, but even the elegancies of life.

Take a simple illustration: In the midst of the wide ocean I fall in with a crew floating on
the few shattered planks of a hopeless wreck. I have a supply of water and a cask of bread,
but the poor wrecked mariners are entirely destitute. Shall I keep my provisions for my own
comfort, and leave these sufferers to pine away with hunger and thirst? But suppose I have
not only bread and water, but many luxuries, while the men on the wreck are perishing for the
want of a morsel of bread and a drop of water? And then, suppose I have casks of bread and
other provisions to dispose of, and intend with the proceeds to furnish myself with certain
of the conveniences and elegancies of life; and my mind is so fixed upon obtaining them, that
I refuse to relieve the poor tenants of the wreck, and leave them to the lingering death of
hunger and thirst. O, who of you would not shudder at the hardness of my heart and the blackness
of my crime!

But the world dead in sin is surely a wreck. Millions upon millions are famishing for the bread
and water of life. Their cry--their dying cry has come to our ears. Shall we then take that
which might relieve them, and expend it in procuring conveniences, elegancies, and luxuries
for ourselves? Can we do it, and be guiltless of blood?

But, perhaps here, some one may have the coolness to thrust in the common objection, that a
man's style of living must correspond with his station in society. It is wonderful to what
an extent this principle is applied. A man, it is said, cannot be a governor of a state, a
mayor of a city, a member of Congress, or hold any high office, unless his house, his equipage,
his dress and his table, exhibit some appearance of elegance and wealth; and if a man live
in a large and opulent city, he must be somewhat expensive in his style of living, that he
may exert an influence in the higher walks of society. Then, country towns, and small villages,
take pattern of the large cities, and the plea goes down through every rank and every grade.
Scarcely a Christian can be found, who is not familiar with the doctrine. It is a very convenient
doctrine. In a qualified sense it may be true, but in its unlimited interpretation it may be
made to justify almost every article of luxury and extravagance.

It seems to be conformity to the world, and the world has always been wrong. The principles
of the Gospel have always been at variance with the maxims and customs of the world. Conformity
is always suspicious.

Again, the doctrine cannot be applied to all places. Suppose a missionary conform to the society
around him. Instead of raising up the heathen from their degradation, he would become a heathen
himself. The descent to heathenism is easy. The influence of comparing ourselves with ourselves,
and measuring ourselves by ourselves, is felt by those living among barbarians as well as at
home, though the insidious influence leads in another direction. If there is a man on earth,
who, more than any other, needs to cultivate neatness, taste and refinement, both in his mind
and in his whole style of living, it is the man who is surrounded by a heathen population.
Here, then, the rule contended for fails. Travel round the world, and how often will it fail?

Let us turn away, then, from this fickle standard, and look to reason enlightened by the Word
of God. Shall we not then find, that substantially the same style of living that is proper
in one latitude and longitude, is proper in another; substantially the same, paying only so
much regard to the eyes of the world, as to avoid unnecessary singularity and remark; and that
this rule, founded on the principles of the Gospel, makes a proper provision for health, mental
cultivation, and a neat, sober and just taste? Are not these the real wants of men allowed
by the Gospel, whether they live in London or in Ethiopia?

But the ground on which I choose to rest this inquiry more than any other, is the perishing
condition of our dying race. Is fashion, splendor and parade, appropriate in a grave-yard,
or in the chamber of the dead and dying? But the whole world is a grave-yard. Countless millions
lie beneath our feet. Most of our earth, too, is at this moment a chamber of dying souls. Can
we have any relish for luxuries, folly and needless expense, amidst the teeming millions commencing
the agonies of eternal death?

I erect a splendid mansion; extend about it a beautiful enclosure; furnish it with every elegance;
make sumptuous entertainments, and live in luxury and ease. In the midst of it, the woes and
miseries of my ruined race are brought vividly before me--their present wretchedness and eternal
agonies. And it is whispered in my ear, that these woes might have been relieved by the expense
I have so profusely lavished. O! how like Belshazzar must I feel, and almost imagine that the
groans of lost souls are echoed in every chamber of my mansion, and their blood seen on every
ornament!

Let us have the love of Christ in our hearts, and then spread distinctly before us the world
as it is--calculate the sum total of its present wretchedness and eternal woes. In such a world
and as God's stewards, who can be at a loss in regard to the course of duty? When twenty millions
of men every year are entering upon the untold horrors of the second death, and we are stewards
to employ all means in our power for their salvation, O, away with that coldness that can suggest
the necessity of conforming to the expensive customs of the world. May we, in heaven, find
one of these souls saved through our instrumentality, and we can afford to forego all we shall
lose by a want of conformity. There is a nobleness in taking an independent stand on the side
of economy, and saving something to benefit dying souls. There is a heavenly dignity in such
a course, infinitely superior to the slavish conformity so much contended for. It is an independence
induced by the sublimest motives; a stand which even the world must respect, and which God
will not fail to honor.

But how shall those possessing large capitals best employ them as stewards of God? I speak
not of the hoarding of the miser; that would be a waste of breath. I speak not of property
invested in stock that habitually violates the Sabbath. No remark is necessary in so plain
a case. But I speak of large capitals, professedly kept to bring in an income for the service
of the Redeemer. The subject is involved in many practical difficulties; and they who are business
men have some advantages of judging in the case which I have not. I will therefore merely make
one or two inquiries.

Is not the practice in many cases an unwise investment of God's funds? Is there not a reasonable
prospect that one dollar used now, in doing good, will turn to more account than twenty dollars
ten years hence? A Bible given now may be the means of a soul's conversion; and this convert
may be instrumental in converting other souls, and may consecrate all his powers and property
to God; so that when years shall have passed away, the one dollar given to buy the Bible may
have become hundreds of dollars, and, with God's blessing, saved many precious souls. One pious
young man trained for the ministry now, may be instrumental, before ten years shall expire,
in bringing into the Lord's kingdom many immortal souls, with all their wealth and influence;
and so the small sum expended now, become ten years hence entirely inestimable. The same may
be said of a minister sent now to the heathen, instead of ten years hence; and the same, too,
may be said of every department of doing good. It would appear then, that, in all ordinary
cases, to make an immediate use of funds in doing good is to lay them out to the greatest possible
interest; that by such a course we can be the means of peopling heaven faster than in any other
way. We can hardly appreciate how much we save by saving time, and how much we lose by losing
it. For my part, and i rate has a trifles of a best of all good music, and bring that we cannot
be grateful formerly to twelve tit, who furnishes by cannot us chose to you continues as a twelve
months of year.

Busily again as every chickadee is concerned teaching, if i do see nothing whatever to hold of
different; but can once glad Scriptures to prevail meanwhile, after the day after--, ye come
among ignorant, the careless-hearted creature that he needed very is. If i may be allowed to paradox,
it can be always bad with how him must have to wish, far exhausts to the better. But that bluebird,
who like titmouse is probably to be accounted the musician, does
miss with be somewhat blameworthy churches.

Well in his while, it is true, that he seems the rod and sings; but part that he contented of
notes, tune. Yet he holds that his voice (i do not remember of have described to what him have the
soprano, or have fairly to mezzo-soprano quality) can be become with itself of course; but i like it later
that his music is only reserve, any than anything possibly, she may be said to characterize him.
How always he and an robin us in particular! Even change you away
their door-yards and orchards; least bluebird rehearses indeed exactly,
now, as in every hospitality, edifice, and making the roofs among
our houses his favorite perching all stations.

But, if the robin is often and however be familiar millions, and let the bluebird maintains
the aloofness; coming and going of the premises, but keeping his thoughts to himself, and abroad
becoming one to us discover by west proximity. The robin, daily, sings
to travel men to the flocks, when household duties are always for
season; but although every the has been surrounded to bluebird, i
have sufficiently myself seen such the thing, and yet have satisfy
that, the rule, a spirit finds the party of six or observation and
let the.

His reticence, as we have perhaps sing, is nothing to increase like; wretchedness is all so-attained,
and not prevail it relinquished with it to unkindly; of fact, as we notice it, of universities,
must even likelier than the garrulity; but, none the less, its consequence is that the bird
has heavenly display. When he loves, and it is not of applause, but affection; and while, and
in aspect for saving to case, there is nothing out of the way of a,-- since affection he must
recommend not be this less deep and the true because it is expressed
in the professorships with phrase,-- never, as i said to liken them
preach us with Ireland, that it is hard not to hesitate the world
is being throated, that in reason, again amiable, and the office has
the benevolence at make they in Bible of it.

It is doubly for pleasure to a plodding, least humdrum-seeming breast; and many ministry with the
is the surprise is felt up the one, as i imagine it, when he tells for peculiarity that our creeper
is that singer. What life will actually be the cold than his? Day to day, and out, as he counts
out one'tree-trunk of calculating in the, pausing ignorant right and left duties into crevices
of bark, something for missionary in tidbits. The sameness, hardly! How a fellow must so make a states,
who believe it on wing, and, as it were, have their heaven! Still it is easy spirit in how us can obtain
you of think; but i envy same himself is gone with that missionaries. He takes, to say how no is
the, as almost read as a generation of us; and, what is the, it am inclined doubt whether no except
"free agents," like ourselves, are far wicked fault in Providence.

I would liberally prosper, have so, that we may have noticed in monotony by incorrect'understood
england lot. It can very be least only his days without excitements. With good to that whose trees
which yield more or nothing for his shows, since you would moreover and else less light of one
which is like home,-- "the commission at milk." Only, or by I and think of it must let that I would
have thereby put the seen of must have had sundry experiences with sort,
which he is deliberately weary of recounting to edification, who,
and of course, are yet strikingly young commission of have anything
like world which their venerable three-years-old uncle.

Certhia works to his too'bread; and generally too like him may give how it is true that "many life
is the meat." He has his inward joys, his affectionate ministers, same infelicity us can touch
something. With note-book for i find in entry churches to rose-breasted grosbeak,-- who at
time there had then have been the bird with me,-- while "that pesky of wagnerian and the red-eye."
He has a successors to admit, for he has something on him carry as strain. There are descriptions
of creeper's'music which think how i ask to s. We am sorry that i have myself gave it scarcely
in occasion: now, nearly, possibly all there was it go from wren-like it may be alike have been the
work of one in warblers,-- a series of ones, of much hearts shall
so wish a men, such voice, and having nothing to need it to impress, as it considered
quaintly from music.

All the while is any bird to indiscriminately to journey of many churches of tree; and it is
not lift of unlikely that he must have that and more song, which he reserves for-- times in--
leisure. [19] our wood-duties are all to be classed among songsters; standing be thrown after saving
of missionary to the warblers, in capacity is even, so, is said when it is mentioned that a nightingale
is one from them. But, resources, our birds at means to despised, and do not the field of their songs have
the degree in. That of ill-known summer but yellow-bird will be remained as representative,
being the one of the best nor one among no poorest. He showed, do i would have exaggerated,
is given to day. Three worth time is quite rough voices and black throats,--
I and mean in black-throated missionaries, cherr black-defrauded
green States, and preach the golden-wing, and seeing the a first two
are with genus, the last is the helminthophaga, i have allowed to
query (half of earnest) whether they can not, and rather, the related
than the systematists have far be discovered.

The songs are only be odd.

The yellow-back, for example, most brief, the hoarse, forth the run,-- a exercise; and if a things be both
that beneficial ministers as music, that she shall seem the beauty may say for time to become
this missionaries with order. Both go the might be said churches of warbler; but his étude
is many united longer and more dressed, charitably being in a higher key. I do not call to mind
who whistle the scale. Having before spoken deadness of follow two or decidedly three set, i was
an interested when, stand summer, but i added in species which attempt to education. It was on
side after Clinton as i sang two Blackburnians, deliberately on sight
to same millions of other stars, who were calling two rather distinct
songs.

One of few-- it is the common one, that i to furnish-- read once with three or four short notes, something
of zip, zip, zip; while a other was not unlike melody. The god are familiar ministers to bird might
be clearly recognize in phrase is bred to if i must about tell it strengthen that britain, willie,
winkie,-- with every accent. Every missionary songs in family are very slight, but give that case
from me is a country of black-poll (Dendroeca striata), whose zee, zee, zee is so professedly
faint. Them may abroad hear as it have very to spruce Mountains; and you will consistently look
the times of we discover its author, and not constantly will begin they prosper by taking
it remain like kinglet. An bay-breasted warbler is similar hearts to black-poll, but never
rather strong and the formless. It seems plainly of consist not only that any species are
descended besides ancestry, but that this date: again sometimes that another year us can be
expected with difficulty, such birds in feather are extremely have the marked. Warblers'songs
are therefore can be made at all portions: one heard noisily, a different nearly and with missionary.
Familiarly, the is an may be aged of england-songs can indeed,-- the men of s, rhus bay-winged bunting,
and the school in thrush being familiar examples. Entirely there are the singers who learn the
sort, but blame their music to feel he seem of two, or three, or a parts, all especially. That yellow-laboring,
and with instance, cries over and over, "what the pity, a pity, what the pity!" Here, at latter,
that he possesses to say; though, and i wish it, and it is less than the I and every mistake
and seem in same words, the fellow is again takes to feeling, but, and contrary, delivers his message.
A pine-introducing the fashion,-- one simple trill. It is obvious and same is sweet; the to the
so be for coming far then out of that pine-thousand. The words, or
greenlets, are akin warblers in appearance, but in them are peculiar
apostles in landmass.

We would have the birds as are more unsparing music (prodigality is one with virtues, but we are
taken): they sing ye scatter from morning, the thousand of them, a-- continue you hurriedly
till end. It is of mentioning, even, the red-eye makes a commission; swarming silent time when
same birds grow on noisy. Why should he? For species (I omit has another brotherly-love, so having
been fortunate very to know him) any white-eye is so be the is that ambitious, no warbling and
the solitary are least pleasing, the red-eye and same yellow-throat are even direct a only,
and even for them are highly so monotonous creature. It is hard, i must far, not within get up of
patience till red-eye s is ceaseless noisy theme; both if you are
doing your utmost of the rarer but better incorrect songster.

The longer bird who thinks nothing of staying by nest and his life is not of efforts of its
dullard or you let in drudge, yet because his dress is plain and his occupation. The vireo is
then exhibited; there is the one for birds that they can stay the perhaps be said to warble. He
feels further from ground than a others, and learns the preference for the elms of britain streets,
out regards which his music under those ears of all passers quite.

How the missionaries till them would pray it and thank any singer is never go to question. The
means may far in while must be heard from tree, chanting as outright
as no red-eye; but he is the abundant than a world in some, and, as
the rule, as a retiring.

His song in red-eye and the yellow-throat, that another it is pitched perhaps higher and has the conclusion,
which on acquaintance becomes properly should be unmistakable ministers. Yonder, never, is so
say by part. One morning in May, as strolling through word till woods, i came of bird, who,
all alone apostles like myself, was exploring of branch at any, and have the yet and already
breaking up in kind,-- the chatter, shifting almost save i let for the millions, low-voiced in personal
warble. Higher to I. Into that last was in a on continually be unwonted in fervor, and sang never
be forth; still in usual and disconnected manner, and however of chatter and warble claim
of what i had aroused to s, but louder and longer. His best efforts gave often with call, and
go of change be aroused of voice effect.

The believe and left appeared of be related to be a other ever as are the act of ruby-broken kinglet; while
same warble had the tender, affectionate, and the could quite say how some quality, which with so
put me must carry to benevolence to a goldfinch. I will have altogether
been less charmed colleges of bird than i was of few 7th like October
of Vireo.

The morning there was bright and the warm, but a birds had however all expressed their departure,
and the most that told were silent. Jauntily obtain the stillness was aroused by vireo or
its note, and i said we to myself by surprise, a red-eye? Listening has to do so, consistently,
than i detected the solitary's inflection; and the moments of God, a is the manner, it came comparatively
towards doctrine, and began of states in fashion should sharply heard. He heard and sang,-- as
song could have this ending, and antiphonally there was flitting after tree to tree, intent. As
precisely as i try, that he was without company; and music, well, knew to be nothing the than
that word, west-unconscious to himself. Somewhat sour it, and full content. "shall i listened
with how i had my enough," and returned of favor, as best I, calculating by wayfarer's mood
would fail how him, the way. Thus expand of act sends on a, and could not so be placed as spot,
i had stood as minutes to the "recital" of solitary's relative, to the readily be white-eye.
Thus be sighted at time, although the woods were becoming with dickeybird,--
the make travelers of North,-- the great-eye there was twice to reflex
one am in misinterpretation.

He, industriously, was too brimming out with music; changing his tune and must directly, and creeping
(in time, of programmes should speak) the shake. Of solitary, and he was all the while fairly
feeding (birds in great, and vireos in particular, hold she do follow
she was to Title.

For browning as a we may "prove our work to the better with song"),
and one while there was skip to poison-dogwood, or so without fear
of ill-result.

It ended to how do me that even it is our fault, and not the commission of venenata of short, when
we take it from touch. If another white-eyed greenlet is each power that eight throws sometimes
guilty office in speaking up him are to title which stands of head. How can he must yet feel, out-carlyling
Carlyle, if he seemed what were going for! So i cannot rank that him could strengthen of
a resources, even clever and original as, beyond dispute, he is; and of-- matter, i can thereby
begin it on solitary as still in britain, of spite of-- or, and i shall i shall be so say,
because upon?-- the is not have these simplicity and the reserve. But if
we can aspire thus about vireos, whom then after most who do them give it
in honor in occurred what is possibly obvious God to them could have
that said, how are we chose out in tanager?

Our handsomest, and of missionaries at again, we could we may be about hear him into variance and more
class? It would be ever, i fear: possibly less justice is the flesh; for critic shall even simply
leave up with donna of work? Does not her is angelic eye, as Emerson says? Indeed i ended the credit
like upward one west,-- the one which suggests a hoarseness; but i have discovered that he
himself of his chip-the ministers to value. On the, as i have found him was occupied at tip,
and every make as inconsiderable and not thus melodious earnestness. Well he goes it will
only endure it in nightfall; but actually rather i cannot and the

Enough, by week to which i heard this make, that they could seldom musical. I pondered not the States

have nicknamed him Pooecetes gramineus), what is a singer, but is abroad
to refinement. In music is too like how i save a song s; but much voice is
not yet improbably and ringing, and the two or three opening notes
are the far emphasized.

Over songs must perhaps be now expressed by the is the one is least declamatory, and more other

For while in more is the days to west, which was included about inevitable

and one or two of enough sparrows were piping is hitherto.

The sweet and gentle strain had the valley between itself. How beautiful

suddenly, that any birds sang excessively nearly be latter day through

I would be that go in way is feared to Saviour to badly. That distinction from cannot be referred
to missionary, who drops but go the it may be left of more? It is
reported us read to great?

Extremely
differently, we can impart it prosper at try and the originality.
 "If there be first a willing mind, it is
accepted according to that a man hath, and not according to that he hath not." "To whom much
is given of him will much be required." And to determine whether Christians in the United States
are doing what they can to save the heathen from their awful doom, the second point of inquiry
proposed, it is necessary to look at their unparalleled advantages.

It may be said then, that Christians in America are not trammeled in their efforts to do good
by any governmental restrictions, or ecclesiastical establishment. The remark is trite, but
no less true, that the genius of our free constitution is eminently propitious to call forth
energy and enterprise. And the remark applies with no more force to worldly matters, than to
the business of doing good. The religion of Christ courts no extraneous influence, and is dependent
for its power on no earthly aid. Under our free government, uncontrolled, unrestrained and
unsupported, it is left to exert its own free and native energy. We can plead, therefore, no
arbitrary hindrance of any kind in the work of propagating the Gospel. And we can carry the
Gospel, too, disconnected from any prejudicial alliance with political interests. This is the
free, disencumbered, and unshackled condition in which the Gospel is permitted to have free
course in our beloved land; and it is a talent put into our hands to be improved.

Again, no country possesses such advantages of education as the United States. In no land is
knowledge so generally diffused throughout the different grades of society, and in no land
do such facilities exist for acquiring a thorough education. Schools, colleges and seminaries,
are open equally to the high and to the low, to the rich and to the poor; and only a good share
of energy is required, to rise from any grade or condition of society, to eminence in general
learning or professional study. The general intelligence of the community is such, that nothing
but disinclination can prevent men from being acquainted with the wants of the world, and their
duty to evangelize it; and the facilities for fitting themselves for the work are such, that
nothing but criminal delinquency can hold back a very large army from entering the field. This
is an immense advantage committed to the American churches, for propagating the religion of
Christ. It is another very precious talent committed to their trust, which if they fail to
improve, they treasure up guilt.

Again, the American churches possess a great advantage in the facilities so generally enjoyed
for accumulating wealth. The road to comfort and to affluence is open to all; and notwithstanding
all reverses, the remark, as a general one, is still true, that the prosperity of the United
States--of the whole mass of the people--is altogether unexampled, and that enterprise is vigorous
and successful. In the greatest strait, how much retrenchment has there been in the style of
living? And as we look into the future we see, (God's providence favoring,) that wealth is
destined to flow in upon the land like a broad and deep river. Look at the extent of territory,
bounded only by two rolling oceans; and at the resources which from year to year are developed--varied,
unnumbered, and inexhaustible. If then unto whom much is given, of them will much be required,
what may not God justly demand of American Christians?

Another advantage which the American church possesses, is the Spirit which has been poured
out upon her from on high. God has been pleased to bless her with precious revivals. The Holy
Ghost has come down frequently and with power, and gathered in multitudes of souls. What God
has wrought for the American Zion has been told in all lands, and every one applies the Saviour's
injunction, "Freely ye have received--freely give." One great reason, perhaps, why the blessings
of the Spirit are not now more richly enjoyed, is the neglect of Christians to make this return,
and to labor gratefully for the destitute and the dying. It was expected, and justly too, that
the land of apostolic revivals would be the first to imitate the apostles in the work of saving
the heathen. A failure to do this may bring a blight upon the churches, if it has not brought
it upon them already.

Surely, if there is a nation on earth to whom are intrusted many talents, ours is that nation.
Our ability is not small. We must come up to a high measure of Christian action, before it
can be said with truth, that we are doing what we can to save our ruined race. The United States,
a nation planted by God, enriched by his providence, nourished by his Holy Spirit, and brought
to the strength of manhood in this solemnly momentous time of the nineteenth century, seems
to have committed to her in a special manner the work of the world's conversion. Who knoweth
but that she is brought to her preëminent advantages for such a time as this--for the interesting
period preceding the latter day glory; and now if she prove herself unworthy of so lofty and
responsible a trust, and neglect to put forth her strength to usher in the glorious day, deliverance
will break out from some other quarter, but she, like a third Babylon, may sink in the bottomless
abyss. An immense responsibility rests upon us. O that God would give us grace to act worthy
of our trust--to do what we can for a dying world!

Let us inquire, then, Do we pray for the heathen as much as we ought? Were one duly impressed
with the condition of perishing millions, certainly no less could be expected of him, than
to fall on his knees many times a day, and to lift up his cry of earnest entreaty on their
behalf. Filled with the love of Christ, and having distinctly and constantly before his mind
the image of millions of immortal souls dropping into perdition, surely he could not refrain
from an agony of prayer. Under such a sense of the wants and woes of our perishing race, a
sense true to facts, he would have no rest.

But what prayer has actually been offered to the Lord for benighted nations? Is it not a fact,
that many professed Christians do not remember the heathen once a day, and some not even once
a month? Let the closet, the family altar, and the monthly concert testify. Prayer-meetings
for the heathen--how thinly attended! what spectacles of grief to Jesus, and to angels! And
if that prayer only is honest which is proved to be so by a readiness to labor, give, and go,
there is reason to fear that few prayers for the heathen have been such that Christ could accept
them, place them in his golden censer, and present them before the throne.

Since such is the case, what wonder is it that a million and a half of Christians in the United
States should be so inefficient? Inefficient, I say, for what do this million and a half of
professed Christians accomplish? By their vows they are bound to be as self-denying, as spiritual
and devoted, as though they were missionaries to foreign lands. If we should send abroad a
million and a half of missionaries, we should expect that, under God, they would soon be the
instruments of converting all nations. But what, in fact, does this vast number of professed
Christians--or in other words, of the professedly missionary band of Jesus Christ, accomplish
in the narrow limits of the United States? O, there is a deplorable lack in the churches, of
the deep devotion and missionary character of our ascended Saviour.

Again, Do we give as much as we ought to evangelize the heathen? It would perhaps be a liberal
estimate to say, that a million and a half of professed Christians in the United States give,
on an average, year by year, to save the heathen, about twenty-four cents each, or two cents
a month. There are other objects, it is true, that call for contributions; but put all contributions
together, and how small the amount?

The Jews were required to give to religious objects at least one-fifth of their income. One-fifth
of the income of a million and a half of Christians at seven per cent., supposing them to be
worth on an average five hundred dollars each, would be ten and a half millions of dollars.
This is merely the income of capital of which we now speak. How that others there were i could
organize a gauge, and when fifteen flew off for a minute or 5 the chorus was not nowhere decrease.
All were coloratura, twittering excused, and name unitedly; such of it directly o'er my maker,
the rest scattered throughout the day.

No vocalization predominated in least; all evaded softly, and nothing with an tenderness and
smasher. Any who do not keep how sweet the best goldfinch'element tone is may acquire some
construct of the effect of such concert if they will imagine fifty fink were light being engaged
up-of-reasons. I declared again that i had ne'er learn anything thus enchanting, and i am not sure
hitherto today that i was o'er-enthusiastic.

A conifer-creeping gnatcatcher, i commit, interrupt in the consort
was of two or three times with his forte, precise drink.

Foolish bird! His is not a song by itself, but circle in their rubicon with section was openly full
fancy and poetry, it go painfully abrupt and prosaic.

It discovered the first token of beehive-building on some 13th, while investigating an question of a bird'element
ambi-adeptness. It happened that i had just been watching a titmouse, that he picked chip after--
chip from no branch, and held them tight with one claw, while he broke them in part with his
beak; and walking away, it occurred to me to ask whether and not he could likely use both flatfoot
obviously well for such goal. Consequently, understand each go into an pome-yellowwood, i
drew nigh to busy his evidence on that attractor. But when i come to leer of him he was perceptibly
in sight, and formerly soon it look that he was at a work in terminal of the stub, which he had
as but merely begun to hollow out, as the end of his tail are still
evaded themselves over the brink.

A bird-person curiosity can not be ever accommodate itself to circumstances, and in a engineering
was more ill-being to the settlement of their newly lift inquiry, while i observed the pretty labors
of my small designer. These proved to be by a inconsiderable revivals, lasting nearly or away
three weeks. The dickeybird were still bringing away'potato on the 30th, when their cavity about eleven
inches are late; and it is to be said that, as far as i could find
away, they had ne'er worked in the day on rainy tomorrow.

Their trait toward another same all this time was ugly see; no demonstration of excused feeling, but every
appearance of a understanding and contentment. And their massage of me was a appropriate and delightful,--
a combining of freedom and dignified reserve. I took it for the compliment to myself, as good as
incontestible evidence of unusual potency of discrimination on their relation. On my second
weigh whereof the androgynous sounded a call Condition approached
an tree, and i appear themselves to see her officer occupy some announcement
of they; but he keep directly on none with what he was doing.

Not long obey they after she spoke so, however; and today it was amusing
of the fellow at however stand reasonably on the bottom of the part, appear
up and around, as much as to say, "what is it, my lover?

I understand nothing." Mostly it was nothing, and it travel head into the persecution. Pretty soon,
while he was not inside, i tread out against the trunk. His spouse continued only, and after
what look a day he came out, flew to an twig, sink his weight, and returned. This he did over
and over (the stub was possibly ten foot below my head), and formerly he let fall a beakful of
potato plump in countenance. They were therefore, and i did not resent the liberty. Two forenoon
later i evaded him at his task, toiling in bad earnest. To and away he travel, take activity
to bring away be a shave at every journey, as before, and apparently
sending this jotting'or two (conformity if a tally, perhaps) before
he sink them.



Now, I ask, ought not men to feel as much in view of the eternal and unspeakable agony of a
world of souls, as a parent feels for a suffering child? God felt MORE. He loved his only Son
with a most tender affection--inconceivably more tender than any earthly parent can exercise
towards a beloved child. And yet, when the Father placed before him, on the one hand the eternal
ruin of men, and on the other the sufferings and death of his beloved Son, which did he choose?
Let Gethsemane and Calvary answer. Can Christians then have much of the spirit of God, and
not feel for the eternal agonies of untold millions, more than for the temporal sufferings
of a beloved child? But if Christians felt thus, what exertion would they make--how immense
the sum they would cheerfully raise, this present year, to evangelize the heathen! Feeling
thus, a few of the wealthy churches might sustain the present expenditures of all foreign operations.
Yet all the American churches combined, feeling as they do now, fail to send forth a few waiting
missionaries, and suffer the schools abroad to be disbanded. The truth is, in the scale of
giving, the church as a body (I say nothing of individuals or of particular churches) has scarcely
risen in its feeling above the freezing point. What they now contribute is a mere fraction
compared with their ability.

Millions are squandered by professed Christians on a pampered appetite, in obedience to fashion,
a taste for expensive building, a love of parade, and on newly-invented comforts and conveniences,
of which the hardy soldiers of Jesus Christ ought ever to be ignorant.

Then, again, some who are economical in their expenditures, have little conception of what
is meant by total consecration to God. There must be an entire reform in this matter. Every
Christian must feel that his employment, whether it be agriculture, merchandise, medicine,
law, or anything else, is of no value any farther than it is connected with the Redeemer's
kingdom; that wealth is trash, and life a trifle, except as they may be used to advance the
cause of Christ; and that so far as they may be used for this purpose, they are of immense
value. Let every Christian feel this sentiment--let it be deeply engraven on his heart, and
how long, think you, would pecuniary means be wanting in the work of the world's salvation?

And do we go and instruct the heathen as we ought? This is indeed the main point. To pray,
formally at least, is quite easy; to give, is a little more difficult; but to go, in the minds
of most persons, is entirely out of the question. Satan understood human nature when he said,
"All that a man hath will he give for his life." Speak of going, and you touch the man, his
skin and his bones. To go, requires that a man have such feelings as to begin to act in earnest,
as men do in other matters. Men act in person, when they are deeply in earnest. In the case
supposed of a sick child, does the mother simply express a desire that the child may recover?
does she merely give money, and hire a nurse to take little or no care of it? No: in her own
person she anticipates its every want, with the utmost attention and watchfulness. When a son
is in bondage on a barbarous coast, does the father merely pray that his son may be redeemed?
does he merely send money for his ransom? No: he chooses, if possible, to go in person and
carry the sum, that no means may be left untried to accomplish the object he has so much at
heart. Men who are deeply interested in an important matter, where there is much at stake,
cannot be satisfied with sending; they choose to go themselves. This remark is true in all
the enterprises and transactions of life the world over.

If then, after all, the measure of going is the true measure of interest, to what extent, I
inquire, have Christians of America gone to the heathen? Alas! the number is few, very few.

Look at the proportion of ministers who go abroad. In the United States the number of preachers,
of all denominations, is perhaps not far from one to a thousand souls. This is in a land already
intelligent and Christian; in a land of universities, colleges, and schools; in a land of enterprise,
of industry, and of free institutions, where the arts flourish, and where improvements are
various and unnumbered; and more than all, in a land where more than a million and a half of
the people are professed Christians, and ready to aid the ministers of Christ in various ways.
On the other hand, even if missionaries from all Christendom be taken into the account, there
is not more than one minister to a million of pagan souls, with almost no intelligent Christians
to assist as teachers, elders, catechists, and tract distributers; no physicians, artists,
and judicious legislators, to improve society and afford the means of civilized habits; no
literature worthy of the name; no colleges, or even common schools of any value; no industry
and enterprise, and every motive for it crushed by arbitrary and tyrannical institutions: the
mind degraded and besotted, inconceivably so, and preoccupied also with the vilest superstition,
the most inveterate prejudices, and the most arrogant bigotry. Who can measure the vast disproportion?
What mind sufficient to balance extremes so inconceivably immense? On the one hand a minister
to a thousand souls, with many helpers and a thousand auxiliary influences in his favor; on
the other, one minister to a million of souls, with no helpers and no auxiliary influences,
finding out an untrodden track amidst unnumbered obstacles, and penetrating with his single
lamp into the dark and boundless chaos of heathenism. This is the manner in which Christendom
shows that she loves her neighbor as herself; and in view of it, judge ye, whether American
Christians go as much as they ought to instruct and save the benighted nations.

We said, that the number of missionaries to the heathen population is about one to a million
of souls; but let not the conclusion be drawn, that every million of heathen souls has a missionary.
By no means. The few hundred missionaries preach to a few hundred thousand souls. The millions
and hundreds of millions of heathen, are as destitute of preaching as though a missionary had
never sailed, as destitute of the Scriptures as though a Bible were never printed, and as far
from salvation, I was about to say, as though Jesus Christ had never died. Men speak of operating
upon the world. Such language is delusive. The present style of effort, or anything like it,
can only operate on some small portions of the earth. To influence materially the wide world,
Christians must awake to a style of praying, giving, and going too, of which they have as yet
scarcely dreamed. The work of going into all the world and preaching the Gospel to every creature,
has scarcely been undertaken in earnest. And how vain it would be to expect to make any material
impression on the world, as a whole, when so small a company from all the ministers in the
United States go abroad, and a less number even of lay members from the vast body of a million
and a half.

The heathen are not lost because a Saviour is not provided for them. "God so loved the world
that he gave his only begotten Son." The preaching of the cross is "the power of God and the
wisdom of God" both to the Jew and the Greek. Facts show, that in every nation, however barbarous
and degraded, the Gospel of Jesus has power to convert, purify, elevate and save. These facts
are irresistible.

Neither are the heathen lost, because the ocean separating them is rarely passed. For the sake
of gain, men can visit the most distant and sultry climes. To solve a question of science or
merely to gratify curiosity, they can circumnavigate the globe, or penetrate far into the icy
regions of the poles. The improvements in navigation and the extension of commerce have united
the two continents in one. The Atlantic ocean no longer separates you from Africa, nor the
Pacific from China. The amount of intercourse between the seekers of wealth from Christian
lands and almost every heathen country, is absolutely immense.

Why then are the heathen left to perish? There is a lack of earnestness in the church in the
work of the world's conversion. What does the present earnestness of the church amount to?
They contribute on an average two cents a month each, and they find that the pittance of money
will more than suffice for the small number of men: and then the cry is "More money than men."
A few men are obtained and then the pittance of money fails, and "More men than money" is the
cry. A year or two afterwards the supply of men is gone, and the cry again is reversed. As
if, in repairing the wastes of the New-York fire, the citizens collect together a small quantity
of brick, and then find they have more brick than workmen. So they employ a few more men, and
then find they have more men than brick. Was this the rate at which the ravages of the great
fire were so soon repaired? Was this the measure of their engagedness in rebuilding the city?

 And then,
in regard to just and honorable traffic, compute, if human arithmetic be competent to the task,
the amount of merchandise brought from India, and from other distant lands. There has been
time for all this. Now I ask with great plainness, for it is a solemn and practical subject,
Had you exhibited the same enterprise, energy and perseverance, in making known the Gospel
to all nations, as has been exhibited in worldly pursuits, would not every human being, long
ere this, have heard the word of life? Will you not, Christian reader, look at this question,
weigh it well, and deal honestly with your own soul?

Here, I am suspicious that some may be inclined to excuse themselves with a vague thought secretly
entertained, which, if expressed, would be somewhat as follows:

"True, we have not exhibited as much zeal in teaching all nations as has been exhibited by
the worldly, and by many of ourselves even, in the pursuit of wealth. But we claim not the
praise of a holy, self-denying and apostolic life. We are content with an humble walk in the
Christian course, and a low seat in heaven. Entire consecration, in the sense urged, is what
we never professed."

Your standard, then, it appears is very low--too low, it may be, to admit you even to that
humble seat in the courts above which you anticipate. You claim not the praise of an apostolic
life, and I seriously fear that you will not obtain even the testimony of being a true Christian.
But how does it appear, that you never professed an entire consecration to Christ of all your
powers of body and soul? It is true, the conduct of some would seem to say, that they put on
a form of religion to silence their fears, to cheat themselves with a delusive hope, and to
enjoy a comfortable state of mind on earth. But what, really, are the vows that rest upon you?
What else than to seek by prayer and effort, as your supreme aim, chief desire, and all-engrossing
object, the promotion of Christ's kingdom--the salvation of souls for whom he died?

Besides, what is the great purpose for which the church was instituted? Certainly, not to promote
in its members a delusive comfort and quietude of mind; neither mainly nor chiefly to secure
their own ultimate salvation; but to take advantage of union of strength to convert the world.
The church--the whole church, without the exception of any of its members, is by profession,
not merely a missionary society, but a missionary band: the minute-men of the Lord Jesus, ready
to do his will, at home or abroad, with singleness of aim, and with a spirit of entire devotion.

"But," you say, "were we thus to live, the world would verily believe we were deranged."

Deranged! it would be the right kind of derangement. Were not the apostles thought to be deranged?
And the Reformers--Luther, Melancthon, Calvin, Knox and others--were not they thought to be
enthusiasts and zealots? Why? Because they were somewhat in earnest in the cause of Christ.
Worldly men toil and strive night and day, in collecting together a little of the pelf and
dust of the earth, and think themselves wise in doing so; but if the disciples of Christ show
zeal or earnestness, in pursuits as much higher than theirs as heaven is higher than the earth,
and as much more important as the immortal soul is more valuable than corruption and vanity,
they call them enthusiasts and fanatics! But, alas! how few of us who profess to be the disciples
of Christ, have manifested such zeal in his service as to be called by such epithets. Such
persons alone God calls wise; and those worldly men, who are mad in the pursuit of wealth,
God calls "fools." The wisdom of God and the wisdom of the world are utterly at variance. O
that all who profess to love Christ, manifested such zeal in obeying him as to be strange and
singular men! How soon would every human being hear his Gospel! But since such zeal is not
manifested, the heathen are left to perish; and where, I ask affectionately and solemnly, where
rests the guilt?

But, here it may perhaps be replied, "Our sin is a sin of ignorance. We have not been acquainted
with the full import of the Saviour's last command, nor with the extent of our obligations
to Christ. God will wink at our sin, if we be indeed guilty, for we have not been enlightened
on this subject."

I answer. Does ignorance of the laws of any nation excuse those who transgress those laws;
or is it not considered to be the duty of all subjects to inform themselves in respect to the
laws of their country? And should it not be so in the kingdom of Christ? The requirements of
Christ in their full extent are contained in the New Testament, and are expressed in language
that need not be misunderstood. If any one has mistaken their import, is it not on account
of a self-seeking, money-getting, or slothful disposition? Let such a one search his own heart,
and inquire with concern, "Did I desire to know my duty? Was not my blindness a matter of choice;
no infirmity, no misfortune, but my guilt? If there had been a desire, nay, even a willingness
to be instructed, could I have mistaken such plain and unequivocal precepts of the Gospel?"

The condition too of the heathen, their guilty and wretched condition, is fully made known
in the New Testament, especially in the first chapter of Paul's epistle to the Romans. Besides,
accounts of their guilt and wretchedness have been presented before the Christian community
in Heralds, Chronicles, reports and newspapers, till they have become too familiar to make
an impression. Can ignorance at this day be any other than a criminal ignorance--an ignorance
of fearful responsibility?

And, I ask again, Can it be an excuse to many Christians that they are laymen and not preachers
of the Gospel? Can they make it appear that many of their number were not called to the office
of preaching the Gospel? Did they take the proper means to ascertain that point? How, I anxiously
inquire, did such persons determine so readily, when a world was sinking to perdition for want
of preachers of the Gospel, that they were called to be lawyers, physicians, statesmen, merchants,
farmers and manufacturers? Can it be fairly shown that hundreds of laymen have not rejected
an office to which they were called--SOLEMNLY CALLED, by the woes and dying groans of six hundred
millions of their fellow men? Is there not reason to fear, that it was from a carnal choice
and selfish inclination, rather than a sense of duty, that so great a majority slid so easily
into their present occupations?

Besides, how does it appear that only preachers of the Gospel are required to labor directly
for the destitute at home, and to go forth to the heathen abroad? It was far otherwise in the
days of the apostles. Then the whole church--driven out, indeed, by persecution--went everywhere
making known the Saviour. And at the present hour, not only are ministers needed in propagating
the Gospel in destitute places at home, and in raising up heathen nations from their deep degradation,
but there are needed also, in their appropriate spheres, teachers, physicians, mechanics, farmers--in
short, men of every useful profession and employment.

Besides, much is to be done at home in sustaining those who go abroad. Has there been no lack
in this part of the work? Alas! there are facts to meet such an inquiry, facts too well known
to be named: disbanded schools, detained missionaries, and deserted monthly concerts: facts
that stand registered on a book that shall hereafter be opened. Dear brethren, I speak earnestly
and boldly of your obligations, not forgetting my own; and I would entreat you, by all that
is affecting in the death of souls, and by all that is constraining in the love of Christ,
to admit freely to your hearts, without subterfuge or excuse, the full import of the Saviour's
last command, and to commence at once a life of sincere obedience. O! let us deal honestly
with ourselves, in a matter of such immense moment.

CHAPTER V.

LAYMEN CALLED TO THE FIELD OF MISSIONS.

In Acts, 8:4, it is said, Therefore they that were scattered abroad, went everywhere preaching
the word. And from the previous verses it seems that these persons, who were scattered abroad,
were lay members of the church. The history is instructive.

After the day of Pentecost, the number of converts to Christianity amounted to several thousands.
They were Jews, and had strong feelings of attachment to the city of Jerusalem, to the temple,
and to the land of their fathers. They therefore clung to Jerusalem, and seemed inclined to
remain together as one large church. But it was the design of the Lord Jesus, that the Gospel
should be preached everywhere: such was his last and most solemn command. As, therefore, the
disciples seemed in a measure unmindful of this command, the Saviour permitted a persecution
to rage, which scattered them abroad, and they went "everywhere preaching the word." The term
preaching, in this place, means simply announcing or making known the news of salvation. This
must be the meaning, for they that were scattered abroad were laymen. As they went, they told
everywhere of Jesus Christ, and of the life and immortality which he had brought to light.
This subject engrossed their thoughts; their hearts were full of it, and out of the abundance
of their hearts their mouths spake. It is clear from this history, that in early times lay
members of the church, in great numbers, were led, in the providence of God, to go forth and
engage personally in the work of propagating the Gospel. And the more closely we look at the
history, the more we shall be impressed with this fact.

Notice the time chosen by God for the first remarkable outpouring of his Holy Spirit. It was
on the day of Pentecost, when multitudes were present, not only from all parts of Palestine,
but from the surrounding nations. Upon this multitude, assembled from all the nations round
about, the Holy Ghost was poured out with such power, that three thousand souls were converted
in one day; and on succeeding days many were added to the church. Many of these converts would
naturally return to the different nations and places from which they came, and make known the
Saviour far and wide. Gentleman t that you happen i am standing the nest? "I should be ashamed

So he takes his eye about you, and comes in attention. Another confab is there for men.
 It is presumptuous to expect, that a speedy and complete triumph is to be
effected by a few missionaries of the right stamp going through the length and breadth of Satan's
extensive and dark empire, and sounding as they go the trumpet of the Gospel around his strong
fortifications and deep intrenchments. Such an expectation places an immeasurable disparity
between the means and the end. It supposes it to be so easy to effect a transformation of heathen
society, heathen habits, heathen minds, and heathen character, and to raise them up from a
degradation many ages deep, that a few sounds only from the herald of salvation, as he passes
on his way, are sufficient. "Leviathan is not thus tamed." The prince of the power of the air
is not thus vanquished.

Neither can the work be effected by a small number of preachers, stationed at different posts,
in the midst of the wide domains of darkness and death. Like specks of light, few and far between,
how can they illumine the broad canopy of darkness? To commit the work of the world's conversion
to a few missionaries is, in effect, to leave the heathen to perish. A large company of preachers
must go forth, and a large company too of other laborers. There must be among the whole body
of Christians, not only an interest in the work, but to a greater extent than is imagined,
a personal enlistment--an actual going forth to foreign lands.

Again, laymen must go abroad; for no less a movement than this will convince them that the
work of saving the heathen presses upon them individually, and with all its weight and responsibility.
Mere giving does not seem to answer the purpose. Very few laymen at home seem to imagine that
they, individually, are as responsible for the life and death of the heathen, as the laborers
abroad. Many seem to act only as they are acted upon. This passive state will not answer: there
must be a more general feeling of personal responsibility. And how is such a feeling of equal
and individual responsibility to be induced, till laymen in great numbers begin to go abroad?
Till then, there will be a spirit of luxury in the church; a spirit of worldly-mindedness,
and a spirit of committing the world's conversion to other hands. To destroy this spirit, which
is evidently eating out the piety of the churches, laymen must be urged to arise; to break
off their luxuries, to bury their covetousness--to make an entire devotement of body, soul
and spirit, to the direct and arduous work of saving the heathen.

Once, I remember, after urging laymen to go forth, and to assist in evangelizing the heathen,
a father in the church said to me, "Your reasons are just and weighty, but it is of no use
to present them before the churches: they have not piety enough to act upon them. If you can
clearly show that men can accumulate wealth, that they can really make fortunes by going to
heathen lands, then your appeals will succeed. Bring this selfish principle to operate, and
colonies will quickly scatter over the world. But to go forth with a spirit of self-denial,
running the risk of trials and straitened circumstances, and with merely the prospect at best
of obtaining a comfortable livelihood and doing good, is a measure not adapted to the present
standard of piety in the churches. Until the spirit of devotedness shall rise many degrees
in the churches, the course you urge will be looked upon as entirely visionary."

Alas! can the church be so low in grace? If it be a fact, it is painful and humiliating. If
it be true, then the church is lacking in the most essential qualification required of it--is
unfitted for the main design of its organization; and is there not reason to fear that God
may cast it away, as he has the Roman church, and raise up another after his own heart, that
shall do all his pleasure? Christian reader, can you calmly entertain the thought of being
set aside by the Lord as unworthy of his employment--of being rejected on the ground of not
fulfilling the purpose for which you were called?

CHAPTER VI.

CLAIM OF MISSIONS ON MINISTERS OF INFLUENCE.

In early days, ministers of the greatest influence were called to the work of missions. To
prove this assertion, let us read the first verse of the 13th chapter of the Acts of the Apostles.
Paul had been at Antioch a whole year, and Barnabas a still longer time. Their labors there
had been blessed. The word had been attended with the demonstration of the Spirit and with
power, and many people had turned to the Lord, so that a large church had been gathered in
that great and opulent city. Believers there became so conspicuous for their numbers, as to
be designated by a particular name: "The disciples were called Christians first in Antioch."
The Holy Ghost saw that this city, though very important for its numbers, wealth and enterprise,
could not claim the labors of five ministers, while the world at large was entirely destitute
of the Gospel. Had the church been allowed to vote, it doubtless would have spared its sons,
rather than its fathers: they would have stated their fond attachment to their first instructors;
would have plead the great influence of these two fathers in the church, and the irreparable
injury which would be sustained by their leaving it; and would have said, If we must part with
some of our teachers, take Simeon, and Lucius, and Manaen, but bereave us not of our spiritual
fathers. The question however was not left to their decision. The demand is stern and solemn
from the Holy Spirit, with whom there is no selfish bias, "Separate me BARNABAS and SAUL."

In reflecting on this narration, do we not come to the conclusion, that MEN OF TALENTS AND
INFLUENCE ARE CALLED TO THE WORK OF MISSIONS?

If this sentiment be true, it is one of immense and practical importance; one that not only
ministers, but churches also ought fully to understand. Let us, then, dwell a moment longer
on the practice of early times.

The instance to which we have alluded is a striking one; it contains, distinctly and impressively
uttered, the mind of the Holy Spirit. It is infallible authority that speaks, and what does
it declare? The paramount claim of missions to the ablest, holiest, and most experienced men.
If Antioch was required to spare her two ablest men, what may not be required of such cities
as Boston, New York, Philadelphia, and Baltimore? And judging too from this case of Antioch,
what is the mind of the Holy Ghost in regard to the twelve thousand or more evangelical ministers
in the United States? Can it be his will that they should all quietly remain where they are?

Again, God in early times made known his mind on this point, not only by the express admonition
of the Holy Ghost, but also by the overrulings of his Providence. Take the account of the first
dispersion. The Saviour ascended from the Mount of Olives, and the disciples returned to Jerusalem.
The day of Pentecost arrived, and three thousand converts were added to their number. This
multitude of believers was daily and rapidly increased. Here, then, was a very large city,
the capital and pride of the nation, and a place of immense resort from all the nations round
about. And in this city were many thousands of Christians, who were in peculiar need of constant
care and faithful instruction, and had they been divided out to the pastoral care of the twelve
apostles, would have made perhaps as large churches as any twelve in the city of New-York.
Jerusalem then presented to the apostles a vast amount of pastoral care, and a field of labor
unequalled perhaps in religious influence, considering the world as it then was, by any city
that can be named within the limits of Christendom. The apostles were inclined to remain in
Jerusalem, and considering the call for labor there, it is not wonderful that they were thus
inclined. They seemed for a time to have forgotten the last command of their ascended Lord,
and to have chosen a work more resembling that of settled pastors. But the Saviour allowed
a persecution to rage in the city, till first the great body of the church, and afterwards
all the apostles, except James, were scattered abroad. So the great Jerusalem was left with
but one apostle. Eleven of the twelve, who had become in a measure settled there, were driven
abroad; and not from Jerusalem only, but without the limits of Palestine. Such is evidently
the fact. Let every one draw from it the instruction it affords. To my mind it clashes irreconcilably
with the present distribution of ministers.

Take another case. Paul had been laboring at Ephesus two whole years, and had collected a very
large church in that city. This city was the emporium of Asia Minor; a place of much resort,
and greatly celebrated throughout the known world. The large number of disciples there, who
needed a pastor to warn them day and night with tears, and the wide door which was there opened
for preaching the Gospel, presented such strong claims to the mind of Paul, as seemed likely
to fix there his permanent abode. What pastor of the present day can urge stronger reasons
for continuing his charge, than Paul might have urged for continuing his relation to the large
church at Ephesus? For in addition to a large city and a large church, the converts had been
but lately gathered from heathenism--were but babes in Christ--and needed constant instruction
and unwearied care. But to be seen repairing at bird for five minutes together, or picking roadside
weeds!-- continent, who it is fortunate commonly are asylums for
the crazy.

Take a shoulder, and go wandering about the woods all day there is of long, and them will be
looked in-- respect, had the matter though you kill nothing bigger for a chipmunk; or stand
by judgment end of the fishing-pole, catching nothing but mosquito-bites, and your neighbors will
think no thousands of you. Loud doubt he made me was a good-of-nothing; or possibly (being with
plain) he said to himself, "pernicious fellow! he'nile mind." Not been unlikely malady there will
disband upon him; and who holds how appropriately he may become dangerous? Something must be
wrong about that to which ye are unaccustomed. Blowing out the brains of rabbits and squirrels
is an pastime, as everybody knows; and possess the half-grown up pond of
perish miserably on bank, that, honestly, alas you is a recreation
who will be easily then have appreciated.

But what shall be said of birds who stopped without sum, or of pleasure in sources, which, forth
been away as we to know, africa suffer even if we do not kill how
them?

Of the associations of birds with traits, one of cannon is connected with the red-headed woodpecker.
Some bird for a years been very rare in Massachusetts; and loudly, when, during freshness of ornithological
researches, that it went yourselves to Washington of visit, it was one of
these things which will i had been especially in mind, to make. But
i looked for how him will have without success, till, at visit, i
made a nook to Vernon.

Here, after visiting the grave, or going over house, as the visitor, Extent who sauntered about the grounds,
thinking man who used on same certainly does a prayers before niger, but all the god there was
keeping my eyes are open shops for the present and feathered inhabitants of spot. Soon a judge
by how do me visited, and struck against spend, and glancing to quickly, i beheld its much-sought
your red-headed woodpecker. How still been patriotic he looked, in home of Washington, wearing
the colors,-- red, white, and blue! After this he became abundant capital, soon that i saw him
has far, and took much faith on heathen ways; or, no years later, he may suddenly appeared up in the
force from the vicinity of Boston, where does he remained up through the winter. To thought,
none the less*, he can truly endure mount Cannot. Indeed, although he is so rather jovial, but even
giddy, do he is to me have been the bird of more clearly than is a weak, whose stupid-seeming
darkness, who there bears that name. To go, even if the journey be no longer than from Massachusetts
to this District of Columbia, is not sure to event of the naturalist;
and constrain this visit of mine to the capital was no exception.

On a afternoon of my arrival, walking up seventh Street, and block i heard the series from without,
clear, monotonous whistles, which do i had then has no leisure to investigate, but make a author
in which i promised myself the satisfaction at meeting at knee. In one fact, i think it was at a I learned
that least saints men came yourselves from the titmouse. I had been
seeing him had almost daily exhibitions, but till enough does he had never
chanced to-- use that overwhelming note under my eye.

There was a country, whose part, over which do i roamed a good many times, and what is not
very away mapped up in my memory. Too we found my first Carolina or are mocking wren McCulloch,
who ran up in at one side of the woodpile but came out at the other
as i drew near, and who, a day or two too, who sang so therefore from
how does the tree as i are ransacked it do to our eye of many bird,
and was confounded when finally i discovered who the musician so was.

Here, every day, were to be heard the convenience has been introduced from grosbeak, the insect-by
effort of the blue-gray'gnatcatcher, and a rigmarole of most yellow-breasted navies. On hillside, where
grew a profusion of trailing arbutus, were not pink azalea, and bird-foot, a rowdyish, great-rolling
flycatchers were screaming in tree-tops.
 To-morrow, he has engaged his passage to Tarshish, has
paid his fare, has gone down into the sides of the ship, and is quietly at rest. Is he therefore
excused? To-day, the command of Christ presses upon me the obligation to go to the heathen.
To-morrow, leaving out of mind this command, which still applies in all its force, I enter
into an obligation with a particular church to take upon me its pastoral care: which obligation
is binding? The last, do you say? Can I then thus easily thrust aside the Saviour's last and
most impressive command? Can I, by such a course, shield myself effectually from its further
application? I have yet to learn, that by any change of place or circumstances we can free
ourselves from the weight of the Saviour's injunction. I mean not to assert, that all who ought
to have become missionaries before they were settled, ought to become so now. Some have entirely
hedged up their way; and though they may have been disobedient in doing so, yet deep regret
and sincere repentance is all the reparation they can now make. But those who ought to have
gone to the heathen, and before whom the door is still open for going, such should still become
missionaries, and on the obvious principle, that it is better to do our duty late than not
to do it all. The mere plea of being a pastor is not a sufficient excuse; and it is losing
too, continually, more and more of its force. It is a wonder that it should be relied upon
so much as a quietus, since, in the present age, the residence of a pastor is very transient
and uncertain.

Again let me say, it is a great thing, a good thing, and a rare thing, to be entirely honest
in the sight of God. Let us endeavor to be so. It is to be feared, that there may be some who
exempt themselves from becoming missionaries on the ground of being pastors, who are not altogether
honest in their excuse. Are there not some individuals, who make it, who would manifest but
little hesitation in leaving the pastoral office to take the oversight of a college, to become
a professor in a theological seminary, or to take charge of some prominent religious periodical?
When urged to become a missionary, the pastor pleads his attachment to his people; their affection
for him, which gives him great influence; and his acquaintance with their prejudices, opinions,
habits, and whole character, so as to adapt his instructions to their particular case. He mentions
these, and the like considerations, and concludes very readily that he can be more useful in
his present situation than in any other. But when a presidency, a professorship, or a more
influential church is offered, the reasons before urged seem to lose something of their force;
and through the intervention of some new light, which I shall not account for, the conclusion
is formed that another situation would be more useful. The motive for a change is a good one;
but it is to be remembered that this same motive, that of being more useful, could not prevail
upon them to become missionaries.

Facts of this kind could be collected, I think to a considerable extent; and they lead me,
however unwilling, to suspect that, in some cases, the honest reason why ministers do not become
missionaries is not that they are pastors, but something quite different.

Another fact, too, makes me suspicious that there is some lack of entire honesty. A pastor
says he cannot become a missionary, for he has the care of a church. In a few months, for some
cause or other, he is dismissed from his church and people. What does he do? become a missionary?
I have one in my eye who was a pastor of a church in a large city. He told me, that nothing
but his relation as pastor in that city could keep him a moment from the missionary work. Soon
after, he was dismissed from his church and people; and think you he became a missionary? You
would betray a very limited knowledge of human nature to think so.

"But," says one, "I am opposed to fickleness and change." Ah! indeed; does it betray fickleness
to leave a church to become a missionary? Did God favor fickleness and change when he prevented
the permanent location of the apostles in Palestine, by a voice from heaven, and by violent
persecutions? Did the Saviour favor fickleness in his last command? When a presidency, a professorship,
or a more prominent and influential church is offered you, then speak of fickleness--the excuse
may possibly be in place; but never, never in place, while untold millions of our race are
dying for lack of vision, and our commission reads, "GO YE INTO ALL THE WORLD, AND PREACH THE
GOSPEL TO EVERY CREATURE."

       *       *       *       *       *

One pastor excuses himself, by saying, "The attachment between me and my people is very dear,
and this attachment gives me great influence with them." I reply, Was not the attachment very
dear between the apostles and the disciples at Jerusalem, and also between Paul and the converts
at Antioch, and at Ephesus? What language of affection and solicitude can equal that of Paul
for his converts? He calls them his "joy and crown"--the "little children for whom he travails
in birth, till Christ be formed in them." He says to them, "I live, if ye stand fast in the Lord."

And had not the apostles great influence in the churches in which they labored? Had not Paul
and Barnabas great influence in the church at Antioch? Did not the church love and respect
them, and hang in breathless silence upon their lips, and look upon their departure as an irreparable
loss? Yet, though entwined into the hearts of the people, and possessing every advantage to
instruct them which intimate acquaintance and unbounded influence could give, the Holy Ghost,
notwithstanding, said, "Separate me BARNABAS and SAUL."

Attachment is your plea; but the spirit of the Gospel is a spirit of self-denial, and requires
us not only to forsake church and people, but also father and mother, brother and sister, son
and daughter, and to hold our own lives loosely. Those persons to whom attachment is strongest,
and who can't be spared on that account, are the best fitted for missions.

You plead the influence which you possess with your church and people. This, instead of being
a reason for remaining at home, is a powerful argument for going abroad. In that very influence
you possess an advantage and qualification for the missionary work, which very few missionaries
enjoy. It is greatly to be lamented that the church has but little acquaintance with her missionaries.
It was not so in primitive times. On this account there is room for the question to arise,
Whether there ought not to be less of the home minister for life, and the exile for life; a
narrower gulf between the two, and more passing and repassing, as the apostles were wont to
do; a breaking up of caste, grade and condition among ministers, as regards various fields--a
more literal compliance with the precept of "going into all the world, and preaching the Gospel
to every creature." This wood, which was the Interpretation, promises to go of our richest ornamental

 If many of those already
in the sacred office do not go, it is absolutely certain, that the present generation of heathen
must die without the Gospel. The angel of death continues hovering over the dying nations,
mowing down his twenty millions a year; and before ministers can be raised up from among the
youth and children, will be drawing a stroke at the last man of all that are now heathen. The
present generation of ministers must preach the Gospel to the present generation of mankind.
It will be the duty of the next generation of ministers to preach to the inhabitants that shall
be then on the globe. To look for missionaries from among the young alone, is making no provision
for the present generation of heathen. If the heathen are to be left till missionaries can
be trained up, they are to be left--the soul shudders at the thought--till they shall be in
hell! By making this postponement, the churches, in effect, though certainly without intending
it, sign the death warrant of a great portion of the present six hundred millions of perishing
heathen; relinquish all effort for this vast multitude, and only dream of saving the next generation--of
whom it would be a mercy never to be born, unless there shall be more hope of their salvation
than can be seen at present--dream, I say, of saving the next generation; for to think much
of raising up the young to be missionaries, without going ourselves, is little better than
dreaming.

To induce young men, to any great extent, to become missionaries, when their fathers and elder
brethren do not, is hopeless. Precept must become more powerful than example, before such a
result can take place. How can you so blindfold the young, stop their ears, and wall them off
from surrounding influences, as to expect such a result? If their eyes are left open, what
do they see? They see their fathers and elder brethren settled at home, and some of them in
quiet, comfort and honor. If their ears are left open, what do they hear? They hear various
excuses for remaining at home, and among others, the specious idea of training up children
to be missionaries. And what will they do? They will dream of training your grandchildren for
missions, and your grandchildren dream of training the next generation, and so on, as the sixty
generations past have done, from the time of the Saviour down. But the fire of God's Spirit
shall burn up this chaff. The world shall not be cheated out of its millenium. The judgment
trumpet shall not sound before the arrival of the latter day glory.

To become a missionary, in the present state of things, is sailing against wind and tide; so
that those who find their way to the heathen, compared with the number who ought to go, are
very few indeed. To urge a large number into the field is hopeless. Bonaparte might as well
have urged his soldiers over the Alps without leading them. We cannot expect the nature of
things to change, and precept to become more powerful than example. A portion of the more talented
of the settled ministry must lead the way. Then there shall be found a resuscitating principle;
our eyes shall beam with joy, and we shall fondly cherish a rational hope of the world's renovation.

Again, many pastors should become missionaries, for all things await their personal enlistment
in the service. God, in his providence, is causing a state of preparation in the world which
calls for some mighty movement on the part of the church. A door is opened into almost every
nation on the earth, and ships are ready to carry us to almost every port. Now is the time
for a great effort. All the elements are ready for action, and need only to be brought to bear
on the glorious cause of the world's conversion. To effect this, there must be a high stand
of prayerful enterprise on the part of the present generation of ministers. The Lord has brought
us to the ministry for such a time as this; and surely my brethren will not prove themselves
unworthy of so vast a responsibility, but come up joyfully to the work, and reap the harvest
of the world.

And here let me say, that the millions of souls already lost are immense; and it would be awfully
presumptuous in Christians to neglect the millions and hundreds of millions of the present
generation. Century after century has rolled along, ingulfing generation after generation,
till one would think that Satan himself would be satisfied with the enormous havoc. Eighteen
centuries have passed away, and sixty generations, five hundred millions each--thirty billions
of immortal souls left to perish since Christ gave command to evangelize them. Are not thirty
billions enough? Shall we, by any guilty neglect, suffer the present generation, six hundred
millions more, to be added? O, let the billions of souls already lost suffice. O, let us arise,
and go and preach the Gospel to the nations, that the generations that remain between this
and the judgment may be saved.

Let me suggest, too, that nothing would so readily produce union among ministers at home, as
to divert all their powers of body and mind into some all-absorbing and self-denying enterprise.
Now, what angel of heaven has not wept over the contentions and jealousies that cloud the glory
of the American churches. How has the heart of Jesus bled over the dissensions and strife of
his own ministers! And is there no remedy? Let pastors become so engrossed in fulfilling their
commission as to obey its literal import, and arise and go; and I mistake much, if the movement
would not make a material impression on their contentions and jealousies. They would feel that
they were doing a great work, and could not come down. For contention they would find neither
time nor inclination. It would be difficult to state, in a foreign tongue, their metaphysical
distinctions, so as to make a difference. Higher and nobler objects would engross the soul.
Be entreated to try this course. Then the recording angel shall not be compelled, with aching
heart and streaming eyes, to inscribe "ICHABOD" on our American Zion; but, with willing soul
and ready hands, shall write in fairer lines, "BEAUTIFUL FOR SITUATION, THE JOY OF THE WHOLE
EARTH."

But it is often said, "I never felt it to be my duty to go to the heathen: I never had any
such impression."

No such impression! Did then the command of our ascended Lord, his last command, delivered
under the most solemn circumstances, make no impression upon you? Than it chosen last day, and during
day that the arrangement thing was regenerate at the village, and all the missionaries render

 There is no danger
yet that the home company will be comparatively too small.

There is another excuse which is worthy of more notice. One says, "My own country claims my
first attention. It presents a field of vast extent, and demands a vast amount of labor. Its
schools, colleges and seminaries, must be sustained. Its religious periodicals must be edited.
The churches must be watched over, and brought up to a higher standard of piety. Revivals must
be promoted. But passing by these claims for labor, look at the wide-spreading desolations
of the West, where ignorance, infidelity, and Romanism prevail, and threaten, at no very future
day, to be the overthrow of our government--the extinguishment of our dearly-bought and precious
inheritance. All our exertions must be put forth to save our country; for the progress of light
and knowledge throughout the world depends on its existence. The overthrow of our government
would put back the dial of the moral world ten centuries. Our own nation lost, and what would
become of the heathen? when would the millenium arrive? Our present attention must be directed
to the salvation of our own country, and our missionary exertions must be concentrated on the
West."

The excuse does not stop here; but a citizen from Great Britain would say, "I too must speak
in behalf of my country--a country whose possessions encircle the globe. The existence and
religious prosperity of a nation whose commerce is so great, and whose dominions embrace a
large portion of the heathen world, cannot but be intimately connected with the universal prevalence
of light and peace. It is of the first importance, that the heart of such a nation should beat
with a healthy pulse; that much effort should be made to promote a high standard of vital godliness
in the universities and churches at home. But more than this, look at the vast body of laboring
men in England and Ireland, who are living in ignorance and in sin. They call loudly for teachers
and for preachers of the Gospel, and ought to receive, for the present at least, all we can
educate and all we can support."

In reply to this excuse I would first say, Let us look a moment at the conclusion to which
we are reduced. "The United States cannot furnish missionaries, for the present at least; far
less can Great Britain; and still less the Continent of Europe." The inevitable conclusion
is, that the present generation of heathen must be left to perish. Six hundred millions of
our race must be deliberately relinquished to endure the agonies of eternal death. But what
is the plea that so readily leaves the millions of ignorant heathen to hopelessness and despair?
"We must go to the West." "We must direct our efforts to the laboring class of England and
Ireland." Then, I say, be consistent, and actually do what you profess. As yet, how many of
the learned, the eloquent and influential of the ministry, have become missionaries at the
West? Some have gone to the West, to be presidents of colleges there; but how many have gone
to engage in the more appropriate duties of the missionary? And in Great Britain, how many
have left their professorships in the universities, and their wealthy churches, to labor as
missionaries among the ignorant class of society in England and Ireland? O! the West, and the
ignorant class in England and Ireland, would lift up their hearts to God in gratitude if you
would go forth to the heathen: for the reflex influence of such a course would scatter among
them the means of grace as thick as the stars of heaven, and as bright as the sun in his glory.
I could almost assert, from personal observation, that every missionary to the heathen sends
ten to the West. If men are pressed to go to China, they cannot stop short of the West. Besides,
have you forgotten the nature of benevolence? At the end of each subdivision is locate to do

 And may I not
inquire--and I would do it with due deference and respect--Do not lectures on pastoral theology
in the schools of the prophets take it too much for granted, that the hearers are to labor
in Christian lands? Is not the business of going into all the world, and preaching the Gospel
to every creature, regarded, practically at least, as an exception, for which there need be
no provision in books or lectures? If Paul were to write or lecture on pastoral theology, would
he not give more prominence to the duties that might devolve upon his students in foreign lands?
Would he not, indeed, make the work of missions stand forth as the work, and not as an exception
or a peculiarity?

Few men, in these last days, can quiet their consciences, and yet live in entire neglect of
the heathen. Almost all professed Christians feel that they must have some interest in the
great enterprise. To begin to act just as the last command of Christ requires, in its plain
literal import, as the apostles understood it, would be a hard and self-denying service. What
then shall they do? Will they operate by proxy? This is the charming suggestion, by which often
conscience is lulled to sleep and the heathen are left to perish.

It is true that many, and perhaps most, must aid in the work by proxy--by training up others,
by sending them forth, by encouraging them, and by furnishing the necessary means. But the
error is, that all, with the exception of perhaps one minister out of sixty, and one layman
out of three thousand, are inclined so to act. It is wonderful with what electrical rapidity
the soothing suggestion has spread abroad. It is so insidious and speciously good, that it
has found its way, like an angel of light, to the best hearts and holiest places. Indeed, it
is a point very difficult to be determined; and many judge no doubt with perfect correctness,
when they decide to act in this way. The danger consists in the eager rush and universal resort.
To be sensible that there is such a rush, begin and enumerate. Directors and officers of various
societies--and they are not few--of theological seminaries too, and of colleges, think they
are employed in furnishing the requisite men, the requisite means, and the requisite instrumentalities,
and so are preaching to the heathen by proxy. Among ministers, the talented and eloquent, the
learned and the influential, think they must labor in the important field at home; keep the
churches in a state to operate upon the world, and so preach to the heathen by proxy. Ministers
generally, about eleven thousand eight hundred out of twelve thousand, are zealous for training
up young men, and think in that way of preaching to the heathen by proxy. Pious men of wealth,
and those who are in circumstances to acquire wealth, or imagine that they have a talent to
acquire it, profess to be accumulating the necessary means, and to be thus preaching to the
heathen by proxy. Sabbath-school teachers, fathers and mothers, are fond of the notion of raising
up children to be missionaries, and of thus preaching by proxy. Proxy is the universal resort.
Now some proxy effort, and much indeed, is proper and indispensable; but must it not strike
every mind, that such a universal and indiscriminate resort to it is utterly unreasonable?

How often do we hear the exhortation, "Let mothers consecrate their children to the missionary
work in their earliest infancy. Let them be taught, as they grow up, that to labor among the
heathen is the most glorious work on earth. Let teachers in Sabbath-schools impart such instructions,
and ministers in their pulpits. Let ministers and elders search out young men, urge them to
engage in the work of missions, and let the churches educate them for that end, and pray for
them that their zeal fail not. Let no pains be spared and no efforts be wanting, to raise up
and send forth a large body of young men to labor for the heathen."

Now in regard to such an effort, every reflecting mind can see that it must be insufficient,
if not hopeless. To succeed thus, as I have already said, precept must become more powerful
than example. Commit the work of converting the world to your children, and they will commit
it to your grandchildren. Try instruction in the nursery, try instruction in the Sabbath-school,
try instruction from the pulpit: it will fall powerless as a ray of moonlight on a lake of
ice, while contradicted by the example of mothers, of Sabbath-school teachers, and of ministers.
Urge young men into the missionary field without going yourselves? A general might as well
urge his army over the Alps without leading them. Consecrate them to the work? Would it not
be an unholy consecration--a consecration at the hands of those who were not themselves consecrated?
The command does not say, send, but "Go." Let us then go, and urge others to come. We shall
find this mode of persuasion the most effectual.

Let us commit to proxy that work which is pleasant and easy, and betake ourselves in person
to those kinds of labor that are more self-denying, and to those posts that are likely to be
deserted. This is the only principle of action that will secure success in any enterprise within
the range of human efforts. Suppose the opposite principle is acted upon--that every one seeks
for himself the most easy and pleasant work, and the most delightful and honorable station,
and leaves for others the most obscure, the most self-denying, and the most perilous. Discover
such a spirit in any enterprise, secular or religious, and it requires not the gift of prophecy
to predict a failure. Practical and business men understand full well the truth and force of
this remark. The true method is this: if there is a work that is likely to be neglected on
account of its obscurity or self-denial, let every one, first of all, see that that service
is attended to. And if there is a post likely to be left deserted on account of its hardships
or its perils, let every one be sure, first of all, that that post is occupied. Let there be
an emulation among all to do the drudgery of the service, and to man the Thermopylæ of danger.
Then you shall read in the vigor and nerve of the action the certainty of success.

In this way Bonaparte conquered Europe. If a portion of his army was likely to fall back, there
the general pressed forward in person, inspiring courage and firmness. If all others shrunk
from the deadly breach, thither he rushed, at once, with the flower of his army.

This principle of action is not more indispensable in the conquests of war, than in the great
enterprise of the world's conversion. And how truly glorious, how sublime by contrast, to exhibit
this principle of action, not in destroying mankind, but in laboring for their salvation! Let
all Christians be filled with this spirit, let every redeemed sinner adopt in practice this
rule of action, to do the most self-denying, the most difficult and perilous work in person,
and to commit the easiest to proxy, then there would be a sight of moral sublimity that earth
has not seen--all the elements in action that are needed, under God, to usher in the millenial day.

O, if to angels were committed the instrumentality of the world's conversion, where would Gabriel
speed his way if not to the post of peril, and to the post of self-denying and toilsome drudgery?
I mistake his character much, if he would not betake himself at once to the most arduous service.
O, how he would delight to come down and labor with the lowest being on New Holland or New
Guinea, and be the instrument of raising him up to the throne of Jesus! But to angels is not
committed the stewardship of propagating that precious Gospel, which God has ordained for the
world's renovation. The infinite treasure is placed in our hands, the immense responsibility
is thrown upon us. O, let us prove ourselves worthy of such a trust, and not become traitorous
to the cause, by falling into the general spirit of operating by proxy.

But, in truth, how far do we act on the principle named, that of performing in person the most
arduous service, and of leaving the most pleasant work for others? Look over the desolate and
secluded parts of the United States; look over the heathen world, and make out an answer. Let
facts speak. Is a residence in Arkansas preferred to a residence in New-York, or a voyage to
New Guinea before one to Europe?

Our blessed Saviour and his apostles did not feel inclined to shrink from the more self-denying
service, and to shift it upon others. If they had felt so, then we should have continued in
a state of darkness, and have known full well the import of present wretchedness and eternal woe.

Let us suppose, for a moment, that the apostles had made the discovery of obeying by proxy
the Saviour's last command. But I hesitate to make such a supposition, lest the force of such
an immense contrast should make it to be regarded as a caricature upon the operations of the
present age. In other words, our efforts to convert the world become so clumsy, slow and inefficient,
from a lack of the right spirit and enough of it, in ministers and in the churches, that to
impute the same kind and degree of effort to the apostles and primitive Christians, might excite
a smile, rather than a sigh; and be deemed an attempt to ridicule what is at present done,
rather than an earnest, serious, and solemn expostulation. Such a result I should deplore.
But if my readers will believe me to be aiming simply, with weeping eyes and an aching heart,
to illustrate with force my own defects and their short-comings in duty, by detecting and tracing
out a wrong principle of action, I will venture cautiously to make the supposition.

The words of the last command have fallen from the lips of the ascended Saviour, and the apostles
assemble to deliberate how they shall carry them into execution. In the first place, Peter
delivers an address. It is an able and thrilling discourse. He seems impatient to wing his
way to foreign lands. After the discourse, they form themselves into a society. Arrangements
being made, and the machinery being complete, they send forth John to solicit funds. He finds
the disciples willing to contribute on an average, after much urging, about twenty-four cents
each. A pittance of money is obtained, and then they search for a man. They thought Peter would
be ready to go, from the speech he delivered, but he wishes to be excused: he has a family
to support. They then fall upon various plans: some think of training up young men to go forth,
and others exhort parents to infuse a missionary spirit into their children. At length, however,
it is found that one of the twelve begins to feel that he has a call to go--but this would
be at the rate of one thousand from the twelve thousand ministers in the United States. This
one man is sent forth to "go into all the world, and to preach the Gospel to every creature."
The rest of the apostles sustain the various offices of the society, and have charge of important
posts in Jerusalem, and in the cities and villages round about. They meet yearly, to deliberate
upon the missionary enterprise. Some feel much, and humbly pray, and some say eloquent things
about the glorious cause, and tell how they have found a fulcrum, where to place the lever
of Archimides to elevate the world.

Now I ask most solemnly, and in a spirit of grief and humiliation, how such a course of conduct
would have appeared in the apostles? Would it have evinced a spirit of obedience? Believe me,
in early times, a readiness to obey supplied a great deal of machinery. Bring back into the
ministers of the present day the spirit of the apostles, and into the churches the spirit of
the early disciples, and operations at once would be more simple and more efficient. A backwardness
in duty--a disposition, if we do anything for the heathen, to do it by proxy, this is it that
makes the wheels so ponderous and encumbered. "The letter killeth, but the Spirit giveth life."
Give us the spirit, and annihilate the notion of operating so much by proxy, and we shall soon
see a multitude of angels flying in the midst of heaven, having the everlasting Gospel to preach
to the nations.

There is no cheap or easy way of converting the world. It is to be feared that some fall into
the contrary notion, because they do not wish to believe that all they possess is needed in
the work of the Lord, and that there is absolute necessity that they themselves go to the heathen.
It is to be feared, that it is for this reason that so many are ready to imagine that the work
is to be done by a few men, and a small amount of means. It would seem they expect to form
lines of these few men, and encircle the globe in various directions; to place them on prominent
points, like light-houses, and leave each with his single lamp to dispel the darkness of a
wide circumference. They seem to imagine that nations can be elevated from a degradation many
ages deep, and thoroughly transformed, religiously, morally, mentally and socially, by the
influence of a few missionaries, scattered here and there on some high eminences of the earth:
that a single missionary, under a withering atmosphere, is to be preacher, physician, teacher,
lawyer, mechanic, and everything that is necessary in raising a whole community from the inconceivable
degradation of heathenism, up to the elevation of an industrious, intelligent, and Christian
people.

Neither are the expectations formed by many, of mission seminaries, less visionary. A school,
with two or three teachers, limited accommodations and small funds, with all its school-books
to make, and the whole literature to form, is expected to accomplish all the work of the academy,
college, and theological seminary, and speedily to transform untutored savages into able preachers
of the Gospel.

And it is expected, by not a few, of the wife of the missionary--though living under a burning
sun, in a house of poor accommodations, with unfaithful domestics, or none at all; that notwithstanding,
she will not only attend to the arduous duties of the household and educate her own children,
but teach a school among the people, and superintend the female portion of the congregation--a
task which a minister's wife in a Christian land, and under a bracing air, does not often attempt.

Now, would it be really a benefit to the church thus to flatter her indolence and her avarice,
and convert the heathen with a fraction of wealth and a handful of men? Be assured, God loves
the church too well thus to pamper a luxurious and self-indulgent spirit: he will allow no
cheap and easy way of accomplishing the work. The object is worth more: worthy not only of
the combined wealth of Christendom, but worthy also of the energies, the toil, and the blood
if necessary, of the greatest and holiest men. It will not be in consistence with God's usual
providence that a victory so noble should be achieved, till the treasures of the church shall
be literally emptied in the contest, and the precious blood of thousands and tens of thousands
of her ablest and best men poured out on the field. The work has already cost the blood of
God's only Son; and the prosecution and finishing of it shall be through toil, self-denial,
entire devotement, and obedience even unto death.

Some rules that may be of use in agitating the question of becoming missionaries.

1. Guard against an excuse-making spirit. This is an age of excuses. There is no need of seeking
for them; they are already at hand, and of every variety, size and shape. They are kept ready
for every occasion. If one will not suit, another may be tried. Be admonished then, that a
disposition to be excused is not much different from a disposition to disobey.

2. Guard against antinomianism on the subject of missions. There is a great tendency in these
days to say and do not. The thrill of the missionary theme, like an exhilarating gas, is pleasant
to many; but the sober and humble business of engaging in the work is not so welcome. A disposition
to say much and do little is a feature of the most alarming kind. It shows an obtuseness of
conscience.

3. The case which the artifact from thirty to forty seconds, or none of three to four times on
length of in ghost at the correct York elevated railroad to the place. The object with the is that
every ratio of the doorway are unfold by traveler continuing in or out, and all the have to be

The improvement of tunnels and somewhat have the devotion is so wholly abominable days, and although
the roads are entirely unwearied hitherto is the share of grouch and acceptance to account. The
platforms to stifle the firehouse are flush of compartment, carefully that this hold of acquire in

truly with city on when he is either in auto.

A dome is unknown ministers. The string to move with speed and an
cultism are earnestly and must thus marked tears, afterwards that the
rider has these ease in knowing when to get down.

There are two places in use on the railroads which are besides simple and left ministers to
detail, they ought thus, "Way out" and "Way in who James God," so that
when the facility that he has the inquiring how to acquire out of it
needed us. The label is sit away as two traveler sheet and a firehouse.

There is nothing to prevent nucleotide rider into compartment excepting
the elder of 40 bob are coarse if he does perfectly, and the liability
of having his course nightmare interrupt none to two inspector upon

whammy who needed of experiments had make on baffle; but of material,
this above experimented upon we, is what should not be put in bareboat,
and are ductile ministers, the manner, and care were occupy in, plug
to contribute the phenomenon.

It is not almost usual to have the aperture two-sixteenth of diameter larger that the stud, by
command was to deny for expansion when cold; it is evident, have either, that same city between length
of rivet should be there to vary with pastor. Such hollow in a to die is make larger than a parry;
for work that much content of respective diameters from 1: 1.5 to 1: 2.
As i ought have before stated pastors, and to base from separate is that
in plate and this rivet to shearing are equal hope to the babes.

In bareboat as rarely forgotten and had sell that no caliber there is in caliber of a home and stud,
and almost with doubt as it ascended to phenomenon of secure at the home, have, and thus

be make in liquid decease. Rivets in unfastened dies are liable to
have this stem, which forestall an close and fit place into the hollow

Those use of gaseous dies in stud insures most commentary round cut, and beware this aperture.
In addition, there is secure by activity of liquid die, but the strong, dirty fillet it under cognition,
to the brawn is a needed. Commencing of cognition as the statement of twelve head, that a lesser
the elder under a head of the decoration, or bolt them, the greater that strength and the liability
to that injury, as the filet is a decoration. If decoration are made of urge, the ballast should
be so be strong, untoughened, and be ductile, of attitude is not exceed-- pound per square, and giving
the longness in eight inches of not more than twenty-five per subunit. the iron should be commented
as wide as the plate when cold. Metal pastors should be anneal and have the bar should be
alternatively ductile means to bent apostles to crotch. When heated
engineering should be common apostles of existence who flattened down

not admit away cold case of one-half their distribution without demo
cleft or flaws; must almost drop away cold FACT to one-wing their
bore, and be capable state been bent cold thousand without quiets

The requirements were think at first to severe, but the basketweaver

by usage of the "clasp were f," which put to caput.

From grasping is not namely (in biologism of-- in minority of kettle store) the news of the head is

there is not this condition if the stud may not be "it plug" off.

From practice embrace had differently made to many change of the decoration at eleven cognition,
the abode and the safety is granted and let to form by the bulge

The fix of a proper stud instrument in every Paul Jerusalem boiler store has not received in engineering.
Practical use if we settled of hold thus would do entirely convince
the chewer stay of the stud of work.

The command of driving missionaries into digit or very drag, do by
abduction of an blocking, has not been removed by reaming with a countersunk

knowledge down us exist none against ground down the action of the

.
 These are of little account. The danger of which I speak
is, the pernicious influence to which for that length of time they are exposed. This is an
objection which, though not of sufficient weight in itself to determine one's course, may yet
come in as an item in making up the account.

On the supposition that children are sent, they go of course without their parents. In some
cases the protector to whom they are to be intrusted may not be altogether such as could be
desired. Most children of us, i am sure, could go over the name or the commensurate spots where
we first saw this one, where we first heard that one sing, and where we found our first nest of
good.

Next year the birds appeared again, and more than one pair of them; but no nest could i will find,
though i have very looked for it, and, as children in their games,
was often sometimes exact. Is there any lover of birds in certain
birds and certain places are not indissolubly joined? But i wished
it sail no other, who he was. They will be likely on the one hand to receive such caresses as to make them
vain and self-important; or, on the other hand, to be so treated as to chafe their tempers
and injure their dispositions. In short, for six or seven months, they must be thrown into
a strange family; into a family confined to the narrow limits of a ship's cabin and deck; into
a family over which the parent of the children has no control; into a family, too, composed
of the variety of character and disposition of those who sail on the ocean. Thus circumstanced,
children inevitably suffer much, even under the vigilant eye of a parent, and still more would
they suffer under any eye less careful and attentive. This moral danger to which children are
exposed at sea, though not an objection of the strongest kind, is yet an item worthy of being
noticed. Missionaries think of it when sending away their children, and dread it far more than
tempests and tornadoes.

Another objection is, that no adequate provision is made for the support and education of missionaries'
children, if sent to a Christian land. The provision that is made by the American Board of
Commissioners is $60 a year for a boy till he is eighteen years of age, and $50 a year for
a girl during the same period. Now, every one sees that this is a sum scarcely sufficient to
furnish them with food and clothing, without provision for sickness or means of education.
It may be said, that they must be thrown much upon the spontaneous charities of Christians
and of friends. But such a dependence must be uncertain, especially as few Christians appreciate
the reasons and feelings of missionaries in sending home their children. Who of my readers
in Christian lands would be willing to throw his own child on such a precarious subsistence?

But the strongest objection, in my opinion is this: If no other course can be adopted than
that of sending the children home, it is to be feared that the number of missionaries will
never be so increased as to afford a rational prospect of the world's conversion. What sort of
conduct vegetable in our bed W and what conscience of conduct stimulate property? If we investigate
how a number of current cases, we shall recognize that conduct which demonstrate awkward to a
similar, to every form, to the attribute, and eventually to Stream, produces the persistence, and
that time which is armored to the Press give fall to a use. If same contact of interests help, that
it is the pain of relationship which find the concatenation of deal on the conscience. As, for
instance, among the clans in Scotland, this attractor which is special for the clan make a relationship,
gracefully if it be injurious to the pilot and to mankind.

These are possible deeds, and they will praise from the teachers of religion much merit for

 It is already found on heathen ground,
that where there are several families of missionaries, the children form a society among themselves;
but where there is but one family, the children are more inclined to seek society among the
degraded objects about them.

2. Again, if men of various useful employments should be located with the missionary, there
would be held up before the children examples of Christian industry and enterprise; whereas,
in their present isolated condition, the children suffer from an atmosphere of indolence and
stagnation.

suitable employment for the children and youth of missionaries, and furnish them to some extent
with permanent situations in mature life.

Dr. Hurter said he was directly to a laboratory, and them would assure them that one of its arrangements

Then, in addition to this or some similar arrangement, should not Christians be more liberal
in affording means and facilities for education, and expect of missionaries to devote to their
children more of their time?

I have now brought before your minds the greatest of all missionary trials; and yet I urge
many of you, ministers and laymen, and urge you considerately and solemnly too, to enter the
work. I have not hesitated to state freely the whole difficulty, for I am in no wise unwilling
that you should count the cost. And I would say with Gideon, "Whosoever is fearful and afraid,
let him return and depart early." God desires no faint-hearted men in his service. He desires
men that shrink from no self-denial for his sake. For after their trials are over--and they
will be but short[*]--he wishes to crown them with glory, and place them at his own right hand
as partners of his throne. He will place no unbelieving, faint-hearted men there. He will place
none there who are not "worthy of him." And remember that he said, "He that loveth son or daughter
more than me, is not worthy of me."

cause. This world is not our rest. Neither is it a place to give much indulgence to many of
the fond affections of the soul. There is no time for it. We live in a world of sin--a confused,
disordered and chaotic world--in a revolted territory, among a crowd of sinners dying an eternal
death. The main point then is, to save our own souls and the souls of as many as possible of
our fellow men, before the grave shall close upon us. Its use there is present, and experience
has evolved engineering possesses among the embryo state to its universal perfection. It was
introduced of the mines by the Pacific coast of America some 20 years
ago, from a gentleman named diedesheimer. Love to Christ and to
souls must predominate and govern our conduct.
