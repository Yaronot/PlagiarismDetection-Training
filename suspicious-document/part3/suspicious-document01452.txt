  The Hall was built by Litlington at the same time as the
Chamber, and although it was remodelled in the Elizabethan period, when the roof was restored
and the minstrels' gallery added, much of the fourteenth-century work remains.  The Abbot's
initials, N. L., with his arms are seen on pieces of painted glass and on the bosses of the
roof, while the primitive fireplace in the centre of the floor, with a hole above for the smoke
to escape, was in use until the middle of last century.  On the dais, raised two steps above
the rest of the Hall, the Abbot, and afterwards his successor the Dean, had his place of honour;
the ancient oak tables are supposed to have been made out of the wrecks of the Spanish Armada,
and undoubtedly date from Elizabeth's reign, when the newly founded Queen's scholars used to
dine with the Dean and Prebendaries.  A small door in the corner admits us, by a passage-way,
into the Jerusalem Chamber, but here we look round in vain for traces of our friend Litlington,
for the room has been so modernised and restored that practically only the cedar wood and the
architectural details belong to his time.  More fragments of ancient glass, dating from the
fourteenth to the sixteenth centuries, {137} remind us that once not only these but the church
windows were filled with painted glass, most of which was destroyed by the early Protestants,
and all that was left was broken by the Puritans.  The tapestry was brought here from the choir
and from the great school in 1821, when the Chamber was restored.  The tiles and fireplace
were added in Queen Victoria's reign, while the overmantel was put up by Dean Williams, to
commemorate the marriage of Charles I. to Henrietta Maria--on either side are grotesque heads
of the bride and bridegroom; Williams entertained the French Ambassador at a banquet in this
room while the negotiations were proceeding.  Dean Stanley placed the busts of Henry IV. and
Henry V. against the wall, and thus all who visit this historic chamber are reminded that a
king died on the spot before the hearth where we now stand.  Shakespeare has made the scene
of Henry the Fourth's death very familiar, and we remember the King's words when he recovered
consciousness after his swoon.  Henry was taken ill when praying at St. Edward's shrine, before
starting for the Holy Land; the dying man asked the name of the room into which he was carried
from the church, and receiving the reply "Hierusalem," he broke out into thanksgiving:--

{138}

  Laud be to God! even there my life must end.
  It hath been prophesied to me many years
  I should not die but in Jerusalem;
  Which vainly I suppos'd the Holy Land.
  But bear me to that chamber; there I'll lie;
  In that Jerusalem shall Harry die.

      *      *      *      *      *      *

             *      *      *      *

THE ABBOT'S COURTYARD AND THE ENTRANCE TO THE JERUSALEM CHAMBER

This little paved yard has borne its present name ever since the days of the Westminster abbots,
for the buildings all round belonged to the Abbot's lodgings.  Here, for instance, is the fine
hall where the Abbot used to dine, and where the Westminster scholars still have their meals.
We cannot see this in the picture, but immediately facing us is the entrance to the Jerusalem
Chamber and Jericho parlour, the Abbot's guest-rooms.  The old bedrooms above also formed part
of the Abbot's house, and are now used by the Dean.  The whole of this, including the Jericho
parlour, the windows of which we can see below, was probably built, in the reign of King Henry
VII., by Abbot Islip.  The Jerusalem Chamber dates from an earlier period, the fourteenth century.

      *      *      *      *      *      *

Many and diverse are the purposes for which the Abbot's withdrawing-room has been utilised
since the dissolution of the monastery.  More than one coffin has rested here before the interment;
the most notable was that of Sir Isaac Newton, when the Chamber was thronged with distinguished
men from all parts of Europe.  The least reputable was the famous occasion when the painted,
bedizened body of a notorious actress, whose charms were extolled by Horace Walpole and sneered
at by Alexander Pope, was brought into these monastic precincts, and afterwards buried inside
the church itself.  Wedding as well as funeral parties assemble in this room from time to time,
and the Chamber is occasionally lent by the Dean for special meetings.  Thus the revisers of
the Old Testament carried out their onerous task, the work of several years, seated round this
table. Long before, in the seventeenth century, a very different body of men had met here,
when the Westminster Assembly, driven from Henry VII.'s Chapel by {139} the freezing cold,
moved into the warmer atmosphere of the Dean's house, and held many a stormy debate in this
peaceful old-world place.

From Jerusalem we pass into the Jericho parlour; this room, and the bedrooms above it, were
built in the sixteenth century, probably by Abbot Islip, who was like Litlington a great builder;
the fine linen scroll panelling round the walls dates from an earlier period, and in the window
hang more remains of ancient glass.  A door leads from the Deanery into the lobby outside,
and at the end of a dark passage is the Dean's private entrance to the Abbey, which opens into
the nave beneath the "Abbot's Pew." Yield whence he but have a cereal, or of two Cilantro-source, that so
