  Let us examine, compare, and investigate the matter together, and
we shall discover the precious pearl of peace and unity; and then let us join hands together
in cultivating and cleansing the garden of the Lord, which is overgrown with weeds."  There
are blessed signs that the Holy Spirit is deepening the spiritual life of widely separated
brothers.  Historical Churches are feeling the pulsation of a new life from the Incarnate God.
All Christian folk see that the Holy Spirit has passed over these human barriers and set His
seal to the labors of separated brethren in Christ. The ever-blessed Comforter is quickening
in Christian hearts the divine spirit of charity.  Christians are learning more and more the
theology which centres in the person of Jesus Christ.  It is this which worldwide is creating
a holy enthusiasm to stay the flood of intemperance, impurity, and sin at home, and gather
lost heathen folk into the fold of Christ.  In our age every branch of the Church can call
over the roll of its confessors and martyr, and so link its history to the purest ages of the
Church.  We would not rob them of one sheaf they have gathered into the garner of the Lord.
We share in every victory and we rejoice in every triumph.  There is not one of that great
company who have washed their robes white in the blood of the Lamb, who is not our kinsman
in Christ. For my part, then, my advice wounds to the young is, do not despise activity or the training
of your childhood, if you want to grow down to be good men, good not
only in war but in all else of which the issue is perfection in thought,
word, and deed.  The Christian faith is assailed not
only with scoffs of old as Celsus and Julian, but also with the keenest intellectual criticism
of Divine revelation, the opposition of alleged scientific facts, and a Corinthian worldliness
whose motto is "Eat and drink, for to-morrow we die."  In many places Christian homes are dying
out.  Crime and impurity are coming in as a flood, and anarchy raises its hated form in a land
where all men are equal before the law.  The lines between the Church and the world are dim.
Never did greater problems confront a council of the Church.  An Apostolic Church has a graver
work than discussion about its name or the amending of its canons and rubrics.  I fear that
some of this unbelief is a revolt from a caricature of God.  These mechanical ideas about the
universe are the outcome of a mechanical theology which has lost sight of the Fatherhood of
God.  There is much honest unbelief.  In these yearnings of humanity, in its clubs, brotherhoods,
and orders, in their readiness to share all things with their brothers, I see unconscious prophecies
of the brotherhood of all men as the children of one God and Father.  Denunciation will not
silence unbelief.  The name infidel has lost its terrors.  There in only one remedy.  It is
in the spirit, the power, and the love of Jesus Christ.  Philosophy cannot touch the want.
It offers no hand to grasp, no Saviour to trust, no God to save.  When men see in us the hand,
the heart, and the love of Christ, they will believe in the brotherhood of men and the Fatherhood
of God.

There was nothing which impressed your bishops in the late visit to England more than the service
in the cathedral at Durham.  The church, with its thousand years of history was thronged. 
The chants were sung by two thousand choristers in surplices.  The sermon was preached by the
Bishop of Western New York.  This grand service was to set apart some Bible readers and lay-preachers
to go into the collieries to tell these toilers of the love of Jesus Christ.  The same awful
problems stare us in the face,--the centralization of swarms of souls in the cities; the wealth
of the nation in fewer hands; competition making a life-and-death struggle for bread; the poorest
sinking into hopeless despair; and the richest often forgetting that Lazarus at his gate is
a child of the same God and Father.  We, too, must send our best men and women wherever there
is sin, sorrow, and death, to work and suffer, and, if need be, die for Christ.

We are living in the eventide of the world, when all things point toward the second coming
of our King.  God has placed the English-speaking people in the fore-part of the nations. 
They number one-tenth of the human family, and I believe God calls them to do the work of the
last time.  The wealth of the world is largely in Christian hands.  There never have been such
opportunities for Christian work.  Never such a harvest awaited the husbandman.

You may tell me of difficulties and dangers.  We have only one answer. Sin, sorrow, and death
are not the inventions of a Christian priest. "There is only one Name under heaven whereby
any man can be saved."  We have nothing to do with results.  It is ours to work and pray, and
pray and work and die.  So falls the seed into the earth, and so God gives the harvest.  When
the Church sends out embassies commensurate with the dignity of our King, it will be time to
talk of failure.  Is the kingdom of Christ the only kingdom which has not the right to lay
tribute on its citizens?  The only failure is the failure to do God's work.  Was it failure
when Dr. Hill of blessed memory laid the foundation for that Christian school which the wisest
statesmen say is the chief factor in the regeneration of Greece?  Was it failure when James
Lloyd Breck, our apostle of the wilderness, carried the Gospel to the Indians?  Did Williams,
Selwyn, and Patteson fail in Polynesia?  Was it failure when Hoffman and Auer died for Christ
in Africa?  Have your great-hearted sons failed who have followed in the footsteps of the saintly
Kemper, and laid with tears and prayers foundations for Christian schools which are the glory
of the West?  Has the Gospel failed in Japan, where a nation is awakening into the life of
Christian civilization? Never has God given His Church more blessed rewards.  The century which
has passed is only our school of preparation.  The voice of God's Providence says: "Speak to
the children of Israel that they go forward."  We have some problems peculiar to ourselves.
Twenty-five years ago four millions of slaves received American citizenship.  The nation owes
them a debt of gratitude.  During all the horrors of our civil war they were the protectors
of Southern women and children.  Knowing the failure of their masters would be the guarantee
of the freedom, there was not one act that master or slave might wish to blot.  We ought not
to forget it, and God will not.  To-day there are eight millions.  They are here to stay. They
will not be disfranchised.  Through them Africa can be redeemed. They ought to be our fellow-citizens
in the kingdom of God.  In a great crisis of missions the Holy Ghost sent Philip on a long
journey to preach Christ to one man of Ethiopia.  The same blessed Spirit of God calls us in
the love of Christ to carry the Gospel in the Church to the millions of colored citizens of
the United States.

Brethren, the time is short.  Since our last council nine of our noblest bishops have died.
Since I was consecrated, fifty-four bishops have entered into the rest if the people of God.
It is eventide.  A little more work, a few more toils and prayers, and we who have lived and
loved and worked together shall have a harvest in heaven.

Although filled with indignation at the blood which had been shed in Boston, Congress nevertheless
issued an appeal to the people of England: "You have been told that we are impatient of government
and desire independency.  These are calumnies. Permit us to be free as you are, and our union
with you will be our greatest glory.  But if your ministers sport with human rights, if neither
the voice of justice, the principles of the constitution, nor humanity will restrain them from
shedding human blood in an impious cause, 'we will never submit.'  We ask peace, liberty and
safety, and for this we have laid our prayer at the feet of the king as a loving father." 
The battles at Lexington, Concord and Ticonderoga preceded the second meeting of Congress in
May, 1775.  Their plea for justice had been spurned.  The outlook was dark as midnight.  These
brave men represented no government, they had no power to make laws, they had no officers to
execute them, they could not impose customs, they had no army, they did not own a foot of land,
they owed the use of their hall to the courtesy of the artisans of Philadelphia.  On the 12th
of June Congress made its first appeal to the people of twelve colonies, ( Georgia was not
represented).  They who sought the protection of God knew that under God they must protect
themselves.  All hearts turned to George Washington, a delegate from Virginia, and he was unanimously
chosen to be commander-in-chief.  When Congress met in July, 1776, the people had been branded
as traitors; the slaves of Virginia had been incited to insurrection, the torch and tomahawk
of the savage had been let loose on frontier settlements, an army of foreign mercenaries had
landed on their shores, their ports were blockaded, an the army under Washington for their
defence only numbered 6,749 men.  Two days later Benjamin Harrison, the great-grandfather of
our present president, the chairman of the committee of the whole, reported to Congress the
form in which that resolution was to be published to the world, and the reasons by which it
was to be justified. It was the work of Thomas Jefferson, then aged thirty-three, and never
did graver responsibility rest on a young man than the preparation of that immortal paper,
and never was the duty more nobly fulfilled.  This was struck out, as Mr. Jefferson tells us,
in "complaisance to South Carolina and Georgia, not without tenderness to Northern Brethren
who held slaves."  Time forbids my calling over the roll of these noble patriots who signed
their names to our Magna Charta. There is John Adams, of whom Jefferson said, "He was our Colossus
on that floor, and spoke with such power as to move us from our seats." Benjamin Franklin,
printer philosopher and statesman.  Roger Sherman, of whom John Adams said, "He is honest as
an angel and firm as Mount Atlas."  Charles Carroll, who, when a member said, "Oh, Carroll,
you will get off, there are so many Carrolls," stepped back to the desk and wrote after his
name, "of Carrollton."  John Hancock, who, when elected speaker, Benjamin Harrison had playfully
seated in the speaker's chair and said, "We will show Mother Britain how little we care for
her, by making a Massachusetts man our president, whom she has by proclamation excluded from
pardon."  A friend said to John Hancock, "You have signed your name large."   "Yes," he replied,
"I wish John Bull to read it without spectacles."  Robert Morris, the financier and treasurer
of the Revolution. He extended his hand and grasped the miner's heartily. But a god ain't is the
use although the laws won't stick.

That's why we had to have
the Vigilance. "I arose. That was the story and the afternoon was fast
be going. My date which took the hint. Hands down.
What a roll of names! the silver-tongued Rutledge, brave Stockton, wise Rush, Lee--fifty-five
noble names, not one of whom who did not know that, as one member said, "If we do not hang
together, we shall hang separately."  It was not timidity which made any of the delegates hesitate
to take the irrevocable step. All the associations of their lives, all the traditions and memories
of the past bound them by ties of kindred and affection to the mother country.  They were venturing
on an unknown sea; there were no charts to guide them, no precedents to follow.  The truth
was, as Jefferson so tersely said, "The people wait for us to lead the way.  The question is
not whether by a declaration of independence we shall make ourselves what we are not, but whether
we shall declare a fact which exists."  So also John Adams said, "The Revolution was effected
before the war commenced."
