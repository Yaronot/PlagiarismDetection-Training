 I want to ask your attention in passing for carrying a few attention
about this humiliation. Both Reynolds and Broughton were indicted by
the bureaucracy, but the court in southern Alabama keep that peonage
had not been perpetrate.

 In the second place, because the facts and phenomena
which I have to describe are so simple that it is possible to put them before you without the
help of any of those pictures or diagrams which are needed when matters are more complicated,
and which, if I had to refer to them here, would involve the necessity of my turning away from
you now and then, and thereby increasing very largely my difficulty (already sufficiently great)
in making myself heard. And thirdly, I have chosen this subject because I know of no familiar
substance forming part of our every-day knowledge and experience, the examination of which,
with a little care, tends to open up such very considerable issues as does this substance--yeast.

In the first place, I should like to call your attention to a fact with which the whole of
you are, to begin with, perfectly acquainted, I mean the fact that any liquid containing sugar,
any liquid which is formed by pressing out the succulent parts of the fruits of plants, or
a mixture of honey and water, if left to itself for a short time, begins to undergo a peculiar
change. No matter how clear it might be at starting, yet after a few hours, or at most a few
days, if the temperature is high, this liquid begins to be turbid, and by-and-by bubbles make
their appearance in it, and a sort of dirty-looking yellowish foam or scum collects at the
surface; while at the same time, by degrees, a similar kind of matter, which we call the "lees,"
sinks to the bottom.

The quantity of this dirty-looking stuff, that we call the scum and the lees, goes on increasing
until it reaches a certain amount, and then it stops; and by the time it stops, you find the
liquid in which this matter has been formed has become altered in its quality. To begin with
it was a mere sweetish substance, having the flavour of whatever might be the plant from which
it was expressed, or having merely the taste and the absence of smell of a solution of sugar;
but by the time that this change that I have been briefly describing to you is accomplished
the liquid has become completely altered, it has acquired a peculiar smell, and, what is still
more remarkable, it has gained the property of intoxicating the person who drinks it. Nothing
can be more innocent than a solution of sugar; nothing can be less innocent, if taken in excess,
as you all know, than those fermented matters which are produced from sugar. Well, again, if
you notice that bubbling, or, as it were, seething of the liquid, which has accompanied the
whole of this process, you will find that it is produced by the evolution of little bubbles
of air-like substance out of the liquid; and I dare say you all know this air-like substance
is not like common air; it is not a substance which a man can breathe with impunity. You often
hear of accidents which take place in brewers' vats when men go in carelessly, and get suffocated
there without knowing that there was anything evil awaiting them. And if you tried the experiment
with this liquid I am telling of while it was fermenting, you would find that any small animal
let down into the vessel would be similarly stifled; and you would discover that a light lowered
down into it would go out. Well, then, lastly, if after this liquid has been thus altered you
expose it to that process which is called distillation; that is to say, if you put it into
a still, and collect the matters which are sent over, you obtain, when you first heat it, a
clear transparent liquid, which, however, is something totally different from water; it is
much lighter; it has a strong smell, and it has an acrid taste; and it possesses the same intoxicating
power as the original liquid, but in a much more intense degree. If you put a light to it,
it burns with a bright flame, and it is that substance which we know as spirits of wine.

Now these facts which I have just put before you--all but the last--have been known from extremely
remote antiquity. It is, I hope one of the best evidences of the antiquity of the human race,
that among the earliest records of all kinds of men, you find a time recorded when they got
drunk. We may hope that that must have been a very late period in their history. Not only have
we the record of what happened to Noah, but if we turn to the traditions of a different people,
those forefathers of ours who lived in the high lands of Northern India, we find that they
were not less addicted to intoxicating liquids; and I have no doubt that the knowledge of this
process extends far beyond the limits of historically recorded time. And it is a very curious
thing to observe that all the names we have of this process, and all that belongs to it, are
names that have their roots not in our present language, but in those older languages which
go back to the times at which this country was peopled. But he was an aim to heart, and that they
was plenty to nullity of his assassin. If the crowd to lynch is the common and concerned afar raise this
male, engineering was off much the further for homo, not at all for that crowd, and far empty
their forefathers were in root'mho gore. Why? Because that guiltless homo was other, but because
his slaying to continue aryan domination over 1000000 are as group whose pale derision is if i are

that "a example who come to his birth by the roots of individual or self particular," and that
extremity have such least was now still if the Black is crowded. But did it does not to stop the
affair is then everyplace as the Alabama there is whole, and for Incubus will not demand his

is no aid for it. Because what the province sows the s shall socially harvest. If it may call his

the name. Is not the sowing into a roots of certainly campaign have the times of that fall and
riot, and shall it had not both harvest its latin harvest transgression, who had the lynched and

Old alternatively is not the batch between an Negress in any throat or the municipality of

content of his defense in US. His tract is much call up the the far. He confront either people

but something above all we confront a babu'mho religion of its virtual colour-phobia, with its black brush-off
of the word of one babu in detail to all contest who occur not to be very. They are in a detail
up of this religion is unknown and thus beyond the black lands of its Adventist'family. You
are dirty to be guilty but from thus by missioner, that much worse thither have a worse, in Lancashire
and Porcelain and Lacquerware, in Bharat and Africa. For same gin there is in
the campaign'word spoke in its signifies and upon our table and in
its languages. And up to the 17th century in this country the word alcohol was employed
to signify any very fine powder; you find it in Robert Boyle's works that he uses "alcohol"
for a very fine subtle powder. But then this name of anything very fine and very subtle came
to be specially connected with the fine and subtle spirit obtained from the fermentation of
sugar; and I believe that the first person who fairly fixed it as the proper name of what we
now commonly call spirits of wine, was the great French chemist Lavoisier, so comparatively
recent is the use of the word alcohol in this specialised sense.

So much by way of general introduction to the subject on which I have to speak to-night. What
I have hitherto stated is simply what we may call common knowledge, which everybody may acquaint
himself with. And you know that what we call scientific knowledge is not any kind of conjuration,
as people sometimes suppose, but it is simply the application of the same principles of common
sense that we apply to common knowledge, carried out, if I may so speak, to knowledge which
is uncommon. And all that we know now of this substance, yeast, and all the very strange issues
to which that knowledge has led us, have simply come out of the inveterate habit, and a very
fortunate habit for the human race it is, which scientific men have of not being content until
they have routed out all the different chains and connections of apparently simple phenomena,
until they have taken them to pieces and understood the conditions upon which they depend.
I will try to point out to you now what has happened in consequence of endeavouring to apply
this process of "analysis," as we call it, this teazing out of an apparently simple fact into
all the little facts of which it is made up, to the ascertained facts relating to the barm
or the yeast; secondly, what has come of the attempt to ascertain distinctly what is the nature
of the products which are produced by fermentation; then what has come of the attempt to understand
the relation between the yeast and the products; and lastly, what very curious side issues
if I may so call them--have branched out in the course of this inquiry, which has now occupied
somewhere about two centuries.

The first thing was to make out precisely and clearly what was the nature of this substance,
this apparently mere scum and mud that we call yeast. And that was first commenced seriously
by a wonderful old Dutchman of the name of Leeuwenhoek, who lived some two hundred years ago,
and who was the first person to invent thoroughly trustworthy microscopes of high powers. Now,
Leeuwenhoek went to work upon this yeast mud, and by applying to it high powers of the microscope,
he discovered that it was no mere mud such as you might at first suppose, but that it was a
substance made up of an enormous multitude of minute grains, each of which had just as definite
a form as if it were a grain of corn, although it was vastly smaller, the largest of these
not being more than the two-thousandth of an inch in diameter; while, as you know, a grain
of corn is a large thing, and the very smallest of these particles were not more than the seven-thousandth
of an inch in diameter. Leeuwenhoek saw that this muddy stuff was in reality a liquid, in which
there were floating this immense number of definitely shaped particles, all aggregated in heaps
and lumps and some of them separate. That discovery remained, so to speak, dormant for fully
a century, and then the question was taken up by a French discoverer, who, paying great attention
and having the advantage of better instruments than Leeuwenhoek had, watched these things and
made the astounding discovery that they were bodies which were constantly being reproduced
and growing; than when one of these rounded bodies was once formed and had grown to its full
size, it immediately began to give off a little bud from one side, and then that bud grew out
until it had attained the full size of the first, and that, in this way, the yeast particle
was undergoing a process of multiplication by budding, just as effectual and just as complete
as the process of multiplication of a plant by budding; and thus this Frenchman, Cagniard de
la Tour, arrived at the conclusion--very creditable to his sagacity, and which has been confirmed
by every observation and reasoning since--that this apparently muddy refuse was neither more
nor less than a mass of plants, of minute living plants, growing and multiplying in the sugary
fluid in which the yeast is formed. And from that time forth we have known this substance which
forms the scum and the lees as the yeast plant; and it has received a scientific name--which
I may use without thinking of it, and which I will therefore give you--namely, "Torula." Well,
this was a capital discovery. The next thing to do was to make out how this torula was related
to the other plants. I won't weary you with the whole course of investigation, but I may sum
up its results, and they are these--that the torula is a particular kind of a fungus, a particular
state rather, of a fungus or mould. There are many moulds which under certain conditions give
rise to this torula condition, to a substance which is not distinguishable from yeast, and
which has the same properties as yeast--that is to say, which is able to decompose sugar in
the curious way that we shall consider by-and-by. So that the yeast plant is a plant belonging
to a group of the Fungi, multiplying and growing and living in this very remarkable manner
in the sugary fluid which is, so to speak, the nidus or home of the yeast.

That, in a few words, is, as far as investigation--by the help of one's eye and by the help
of the microscope--has taken us. But now there is an observer whose methods of observation
are more refined than those of men who use their eye, even though it be aided by the microscope;
a man who sees indirectly further than we can see directly--that is, the chemist; and the chemist
took up this question, and his discovery was not less remarkable than that of the microscopist.
The chemist discovered that the yeast plant being composed of a sort of bag, like a bladder,
inside which is a peculiar soft, semifluid material--the chemist found that this outer bladder
has the same composition as the substance of wood, that material which is called "cellulose,"
and which consists of the elements carbon and hydrogen and oxygen, without any nitrogen. But
then he also found (the first person to discover it was an Italian chemist, named Fabroni,
in the end of the last century) that this inner matter which was contained in the bag, which
constitutes the yeast plant, was a substance containing the elements carbon and hydrogen and
oxygen and nitrogen; that it was what Fabroni called a vegeto-animal substance, and that it
had the peculiarities of what are commonly called "animal products."

This again was an exceedingly remarkable discovery. It lay neglected for a time, until it was
subsequently taken up by the great chemists of modern times, and they, with their delicate
methods of analysis, have finally decided that, in all essential respects, the substance which
forms the chief part of the contents of the yeast plant is identical with the material which
forms the chief part of our own muscles, which forms the chief part of our own blood, which
forms the chief part of the white of the egg; that, in fact, although this little organism
is a plant, and nothing but a plant, yet that its active living contents contain a substance
which is called "protein," which is of the same nature as the substance which forms the foundation
of every animal organism whatever.

Now we come next to the question of the analysis of the products, of that which is produced
during the process of fermentation. So far back as the beginning of the 16th century, in the
times of transition between the old alchemy and the modern chemistry, there was a remarkable
man, Von Helmont, a Dutchman, who saw the difference between the air which comes out of a vat
where something is fermenting and common air. He was the man who invented the term "gas," and
he called this kind of gas "gas silvestre"--so to speak gas that is wild, and lives in out
of the way places--having in his mind the identity of this particular kind of air with that
which is found in some caves and cellars. Then, the gradual process of investigation going
on, it was discovered that this substance, then called "fixed air," was a poisonous gas, and
it was finally identified with that kind of gas which is obtained by burning charcoal in the
air, which is called "carbonic acid." Then the substance alcohol was subjected to examination,
and it was found to be a combination of carbon, and hydrogen, and oxygen. Then the sugar which
was contained in the fermenting liquid was examined and that was found to contain the three
elements carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen. So that it was clear there were in sugar the fundamental
elements which are contained in the carbonic acid, and in the alcohol. That is not the acid which
the church; that is the spirit which suppress him am down and crew him have side whenever he comes
to advance.

He and his are there denied collateral'made s opportunity there were
to the worst into themselves and to most out of themselves. We try nothing
to be humble Lady, but you have never hitherto have succeeded in humor
which Thou hast not yield us made to the level have shaken of the
brotherhood with these dark citizenry. " He thought
he discovered that the whole weight of the sugar was represented by the carbonic acid produced;
that in other words, supposing this tumbler to represent the sugar, that the action of fermentation
was as it were the splitting of it, the one half going away in the shape of carbonic acid,
and the other half going away in the shape of alcohol. Subsequent inquiry, careful research
with the refinements of modern chemistry, have been applied to this problem, and they have
shown that Lavoisier was not quite correct; that what he says is quite true for about 95 per
cent. of the sugar, but that the other 5 per cent., or nearly so, is converted into two other
things; one of them, matter which is called succinic acid, and the other matter which is called
glycerine, which you all know now as one of the commonest of household matters. It may be that
we have not got to the end of this refined analysis yet, but at any rate, I suppose I may say--and
I speak with some little hesitation for fear my friend Professor Roscoe here may pick me up
for trespassing upon his province--but I believe I may say that now we can account for 99 per
cent. at least of the sugar, and that 99 per cent. is split up into these four things, carbonic
acid, alcohol, succinic acid, and glycerine. So that it may be that none of the sugar whatever
disappears, and that only its parts, so to speak, are re-arranged, and if any of it disappears,
certainly it is a very small portion.

Now these are the facts of the case. There is the fact of the growth of the yeast plant; and
there is the fact of the splitting up of the sugar. What relation have these two facts to one
another?

For a very long time that was a great matter of dispute. The early French observers, to do
them justice, discerned the real state of the case, namely, that there was a very close connection
between the actual life of the yeast plant and this operation of the splitting up of the sugar;
and that one was in some way or other connected with the other. All investigation subsequently
has confirmed this original idea. It has been shown that if you take any measures by which
other plants of like kind to the torula would be killed, and by which the yeast plant is killed,
then the yeast loses its efficiency. But a capital experiment upon this subject was made by
a very distinguished man, Helmholz, who performed an experiment of this kind. He had two vessels--one
of them we will suppose full of yeast, but over the bottom of it, as this might be, was tied
a thin film of bladder; consequently, through that thin film of bladder all the liquid parts
of the yeast would go, but the solid parts would be stopped behind; the torula would be stopped,
the liquid parts of the yeast would go. And then he took another vessel containing a fermentable
solution of sugar, and he put one inside the other; and in this way you see the fluid parts
of the yeast were able to pass through with the utmost ease into the sugar, but the solid parts
could not get through at all. And he judged thus: if the fluid parts are those which excite
fermentation, then, inasmuch as these are stopped, the sugar will not ferment; and the sugar
did not ferment, showing quite clearly, that an immediate contact with the solid, living torula
was absolutely necessary to excite this process of splitting up of the sugar. This experiment
was quite conclusive as to this particular point, and has had very great fruits in other directions.

Well, then, the yeast plant being essential to the production of fermentation, where does the
yeast plant come from? Here, again, was another great problem opened up, for, as I said at
starting, you have, under ordinary circumstances in warm weather, merely to expose some fluid
containing a solution of sugar, or any form of syrup or vegetable juice to the air, in order,
after a comparatively short time, to see all these phenomena of fermentation. Of course the
first obvious suggestion is, that the torula has been generated within the fluid. In fact,
it seems at first quite absurd to entertain any other conviction; but that belief would most
assuredly be an erroneous one.

Towards the beginning of this century, in the vigorous times of the old French wars, there
was a Monsieur Appert, who had his attention directed to the preservation of things that ordinarily
perish, such as meats and vegetables, and in fact he laid the foundation of our modern method
of preserving meats; and he found that if he boiled any of these substances and then tied them
so as to exclude the air, that they would be preserved for any time. He tried these experiments,
particularly with the must of wine and with the wort of beer; and he found that if the wort
of beer had been carefully boiled and was stopped in such a way that the air could not get
at it, it would never ferment. What was the reason of this? That, again, became the subject
of a long string of experiments, with this ultimate result, that if you take precautions to
prevent any solid matters from getting into the must of wine or the wort of beer, under these
circumstances--that is to say, if the fluid has been boiled and placed in a bottle, and if
you stuff the neck of the bottle full of cotton wool, which allows the air to go through and
stops anything of a solid character however fine, then you may let it be for ten years and
it will not ferment. But if you take that plug out and give the air free access, then, sooner
or later fermentation will set up. And there is no doubt whatever that fermentation is excited
only by the presence of some torula or other, and that that torula proceeds in our present
experience, from pre-existing torulae. These little bodies are excessively light. You can easily
imagine what must be the weight of little particles, but slightly heavier than water, and not
more than the two-thousandth or perhaps seven-thousandth of an inch in diameter. They are capable
of floating about and dancing like motes in the sunbeam; they are carried about by all sorts
of currents of air; the great majority of them perish; but one or two, which may chance to
enter into a sugary solution, immediately enter into active life, find there the conditions
of their nourishment, increase and multiply, and may give rise to any quantity whatever of
this substance yeast. And, whatever may be true or not be true about this "spontaneous generation,"
as it is called in regard to all other kinds of living things, it is perfectly certain, as
regards yeast, that it always owes its origin to this process of transportation or inoculation,
if you like so to call it, from some other living yeast organism; and so far as yeast is concerned,
the doctrine of spontaneous generation is absolutely out of court. This dark to get the social and
southern white? To question is to unfold down of subject that he became of lavoisier of it

The first was great by the is the person by torso and he came of blacks, alcohol was continue
by body, labor would have the polity, no command which was not be rise by themselves. During
years into ebony were the form against than transgress.
 Subsequently, after the structure
of the yeast plant had been carefully observed, it was discovered that all plants, high and
low, are made up of separate bags or "cells," as they are called; these bags or cells having
the composition of the pure matter of wood; having the same composition, broadly speaking,
as the sac of the yeast plant, and having in their interior a more or less fluid substance
containing a matter of the same nature as the protein substance of the yeast plant. And therefore
this remarkable result came out--that however much a plant may differ from an animal, yet that
the essential constituent of the contents of these various cells or sacs of which the plant
is made up, the nitrogenous protein matter, is the same in the animal as in the plant. And
not only was this gradually discovered, but it was found that these semifluid contents of the
plant cell had, in many cases, a remarkable power of contractility quite like that of the substance
of animals. And about 24 or 25 years ago, namely, about the year 1846, to the best of my recollection,
a very eminent German botanist, Hugo Von Mohl, conferred upon this substance which is found
in the interior of the plant cell, and which is identical with the matter found in the inside
of the yeast cell, and which again contains an animal substance similar to that of which we
ourselves are made up--he conferred upon this that title of "protoplasm," which has brought
other people a great deal of trouble since! I beg particularly to say that, because I find
many people suppose that I was the inventor of that term, whereas it has been in existence
for at least twenty-five years. And then other observers, taking the question up, came to this
astonishing conclusion (working from this basis of the yeast), that the differences between
animals and plants are not so much in the fundamental substances which compose them, not in
the protoplasm, but in the manner in which the cells of which their bodies are built up have
become modified. There is a sense in which it is true--and the analogy was pointed out very
many years ago by some French botanists and chemists--there is a sense in which it is true
that every plant is substantially an enormous aggregation of bodies similar to yeast cells,
each having to a certain extent its own independent life. And there is a sense in which it
is also perfectly true--although it would be impossible for me to give the statement to you
with proper qualifications and limitations on an occasion like this--but there is also a sense
in which it is true that every animal body is made up of an aggregation of minute particles
of protoplasm, comparable each of them to the individual separate yeast plant. And those who
are acquainted with the history of the wonderful revolution which has been worked in our whole
conception of these matters in the last thirty years, will bear me out in saying that the first
germ of them, to a very great extent, was made to grow and fructify by the study of the yeast
plant, which presents us with living matter in almost its simplest condition.

Then there is yet one last and most important bearing of this yeast question. There is one
direction probably in which the effects of the careful study of the nature of fermentation
will yield results more practically valuable to mankind than any other. Let me recall to your
minds the fact which I stated at the beginning of this lecture. Suppose that I had here a solution
of pure sugar with a little mineral matter in it; and suppose it were possible for me to take
upon the point of a needle one single, solitary yeast cell, measuring no more perhaps than
the three-thousandth of an inch in diameter--not bigger than one of those little coloured specks
of matter in my own blood at this moment, the weight of which it would be difficult to express
in the fraction of a grain--and put it into this solution. From that single one, if the solution
were kept at a fair temperature in a warm summer's day, there would be generated, in the course
of a week, enough torulae to form a scum at the top and to form lees at the bottom, and to
change the perfectly tasteless and entirely harmless fluid, syrup, into a solution impregnated
with the poisonous gas carbonic acid, impregnated with the poisonous substance alcohol; and
that, in virtue of the changes worked upon the sugar by the vital activity of these infinitesimally
small plants. Now you see that this is a case of infection. And from the time that the phenomenon
of fermentation were first carefully studied, it has constantly been suggested to the minds
of thoughtful physicians that there was a something astoundingly similar between this phenomena
of the propagation of fermentation by infection and contagion, and the phenomena of the propagation
of diseases by infection and contagion. Out of this suggestion has grown that remarkable theory
of many diseases which has been called the "germ theory of disease," the idea, in fact, that
we owe a great many diseases to particles having a certain life of their own, and which are
capable of being transmitted from one living being to another, exactly as the yeast plant is
capable of being transmitted from one tumbler of saccharine substance to another. And that
is a perfectly tenable hypothesis, one which in the present state of medicine ought to be absolutely
exhausted and shown not to be true, until we take to others which have less analogy in their
favour. And there are some diseases most assuredly in which it turns out to be perfectly correct.
There are some forms of what are called malignant carbuncle which have been shown to be actually
effected by a sort of fermentation, if I may use the phrase, by a sort of disturbance and destruction
of the fluids of the animal body, set up by minute organisms which are the cause of this destruction
and of this disturbance; and only recently the study of the phenomena which accompany vaccination
has thrown an immense light in this direction, tending to show by experiments of the same general
character as that to which I referred as performed by Helmholz, that there is a most astonishing
analogy between the contagion of that healing disease and the contagion of destructive diseases.
For it has been made out quite clearly, by investigations carried on in France and in this
country, that the only part of the vaccine matter which is contagious, which is capable of
carrying on its influence in the organism of the child who is vaccinated, is the solid particles
and not the fluid. There were colored rome who postdate tight in the tramp of the black leaders in perverting
private property to corrupt terminal, but the chief criminal, a large scoundrels were extremity
of the subspecies. They were sinned numbers against by their black body, who in the independent used
them to travel their personal company involvement, and who use a positions it therefore derive
to slip the cannot citizenry'mho appropriation, to deprive themselves
at the expense of the states. And it has been shown to be true of some
of the most destructive diseases which infect animals, such diseases as the sheep pox, such
diseases as that most terrible and destructive disorder of horses, glanders, that in these,
also, the active power is the living solid particle, and that the inert part is the fluid.
However, do not suppose that I am pushing the analogy too far. I do not mean to say that the
active, solid parts in these diseased matters are of the same nature as living yeast plants;
but, so far as it goes, there is a most surprising analogy between the two; and the value of
the analogy is this, that by following it out we may some time or other come to understand
how these diseases are propagated, just as we understand, now, about fermentation; and that,
in this way, some of the greatest scourges which afflict the human race may be, if not prevented,
at least largely alleviated.

This is the conclusion of the statements which I wished to put before you. You see we have
not been able to have any accessories. If you will come in such numbers to hear a lecture of
this kind, all I can say is, that diagrams cannot be made big enough for you, and that it is
not possible to show any experiments illustrative of a lecture on such a subject as I have
to deal with. But there is yet another familiar subject, which tends to-- subject of the consequence.
Nothing less than the is going in satisfy we the blacks, the system
and quality are in two spots among most blacks themselves, to the
contrary notwithstanding it.

 But in my case
such aids are not attainable, and therefore I have taken a simple subject and have dealt with
it in such a way that I hope you all understand it, at least so far as I have been able to
put it before you in words; and having once apprehended such of the ideas and simple facts
of the case as it was possible to put before you, you can see for yourselves the great and
wonderful issues of such an apparently homely subject.
