"And do you say you heard them settle an appointment for a duel?" said the Clerk; "and did
you no take ony measures to hinder mischief, Mrs. Dods, having such a respect for this lad
as you say you have, Mrs. Dods?--I really wadna have looked for the like o' this at your hands."

"In truth, Mr. Bindloose," said Meg, putting her apron to her eyes, "and that's what vexes
me mair than a' the rest, and ye needna say muckle to ane whose heart is e'en the sairer that
she has been a thought to blame. But there has been mony a challenge, as they ca' it, passed
in my house, when thae daft lads of the Wildfire Club and the Helter-skelter were upon their
rambles; and they had aye sense eneugh to make it up without fighting, sae that I really did
not apprehend ony thing like mischief.--And ye maun think, moreover, Mr. Bindloose, that it
would have been an unco thing if a guest, in a decent and creditable public like mine, was
to have cried coward before ony of thae landlouping blackguards that live down at the hottle
yonder."

"That is to say, Mrs. Dods, you were desirous your guest should fight for the honour of your
house," said Bindloose.

"What for no, Mr. Bindloose?--Isna that kind of fray aye about honour? and what for should
the honour of a substantial, four-nooked, sclated house of three stories, no be foughten for,
as weel as the credit of ony of these feckless callants that make such a fray about their reputation?--I
promise you my house, the Cleikum, stood in the Auld Town of St. Ronan's before they were born,
and it will stand there after they are hanged, as I trust some of them are like to be."

"Well, but perhaps your lodger had less zeal for the honour of the house, and has quietly taken
himself out of harm's way," said Mr. Bindloose; "for if I understand your story, this meeting
never took place."

"Have less zeal!" said Meg, determined to be pleased with no supposition of her lawyer, "Mr.
Bindloose, ye little ken him--I wish ye had seen him when he was angry!--I dared hardly face
him mysell, and there are no mony folk that I am feared for--Meeting! there was nae meeting,
I trow--they never dared to meet him fairly--but I am sure waur came of it than ever would
have come of a meeting; for Anthony heard twa shots gang off as he was watering the auld naig
down at the burn, and that is not far frae the footpath that leads to the Buck-stane. I was
angry at him for no making on to see what the matter was, but he thought it was auld Pirner
out wi' the double barrel, and he wasna keen of making himself a witness, in case he suld have
been caa'd on in the Poaching Court."

"Well," said the Sheriff-clerk, "and I dare say he did hear a poacher fire a couple of shots--nothing
more likely. Believe me, Mrs. Dods, your guest had no fancy for the party Captain MacTurk invited
him to--and being a quiet sort of man, he has just walked away to his own home, if he has one--I
am really sorry you have given yourself the trouble of this long journey about so simple a matter."

Mrs. Dods remained with her eyes fixed on the ground in a very sullen and discontented posture,
and when she spoke, it was in a tone of corresponding displeasure.

"Aweel--aweel--live and learn, they say--I thought I had a friend in you, Mr. Bindloose--I
am sure I aye took your part when folk miscaa'd ye, and said ye were this, that, and the other
thing, and little better than an auld sneck-drawing loon, Mr. Bindloose.--And ye have aye keepit
my penny of money, though, nae doubt, Tam Turnpenny lives nearer me, and they say he allows
half a per cent mair than ye do if the siller lies, and mine is but seldom steered."

"But ye have not the Bank's security, madam," said Mr. Bindloose, reddening. "I say harm of
nae man's credit--ill would it beseem me--but there is a difference between Tam Turnpenny and
the Bank, I trow."

"Weel, weel, Bank here Bank there, I thought I had a friend in you, Mr. Bindloose; and here
am I, come from my ain house all the way to yours for sma' comfort, I think."

"My stars, madam," said the perplexed scribe, "what would you have me to do in such a blind
story as yours, Mrs. Dods?--Be a thought reasonable--consider that there is no Corpus delicti."

"Corpus delicti? and what's that?" said Meg; "something to be paid for, nae doubt, for your
hard words a' end in that.--And what for suld I no have a Corpus delicti, or a Habeas Corpus,
or ony other Corpus that I like, sae lang as I am willing to lick and lay down the ready siller?"

"Lord help and pardon us, Mrs. Dods," said the distressed agent, "ye mistake the matter a'thegether!
When I say there is no Corpus delicti, I mean to say there is no proof that a crime has been
committed."[I-19]

"And does the man say that murder is not a crime, than?" answered Meg, who had taken her own
view of the subject far too strongly to be converted to any other--"Weel I wot it's a crime,
baith by the law of God and man, and mony a pretty man has been strapped for it."

"I ken all that very weel," answered the writer; "but, my stars, Mrs. Dods, there is nae evidence
of murder in this case--nae proof that a man has been slain--nae production of his dead body--and
that is what we call the Corpus delicti."

"Weel, than, the deil lick it out of ye," said Meg, rising in wrath, "for I will awa hame again;
and as for the puir lad's body, I'll hae it fund, if it cost me turning the earth for three
miles round wi' pick and shool--if it were but to give the puir bairn Christian burial, and
to bring punishment on MacTurk and the murdering crew at the Waal, and to shame an auld doited
fule like yoursell, John Bindloose."

 On the contrary, he condoled with her very cordially, and went so far as to hint,
that if Mr. Touchwood had come to Marchthorn with post-horses, as he supposed from his dress,
she could have the advantage of them to return with more despatch to St. Ronan's.

"I am not sure," said Mr. Touchwood, suddenly, "but I may return there myself. In that case
I will be glad to set this good lady down, and to stay a few days at her house if she will
receive me.--I respect a woman like you, ma'am, who pursue the occupation of your father--I
have been in countries, ma'am, where people have followed the same trade, from father to son,
for thousands of years--And I like the fashion--it shows a steadiness and sobriety of character."

Mrs. Dods put on a joyous countenance at this proposal, protesting that all should be done
in her power to make things agreeable; and while her good friend, Mr. Bindloose, expatiated
upon the comfort her new guest would experience at the Cleikum, she silently contemplated with
delight the prospect of a speedy and dazzling triumph, by carrying off a creditable customer
from her showy and successful rival at the Well.

"I shall be easily accommodated, ma'am," said the stranger; "I have travelled too much and
too far to be troublesome. A Spanish venta, a Persian khan, or a Turkish caravanserail, is
all the same to me--only, as I have no servant--indeed, never can be plagued with one of these
idle loiterers,--I must beg you will send to the Well for a bottle of the water on such mornings
as I cannot walk there myself--I find it is really of some service to me."

Mrs. Dods readily promised compliance with this reasonable request; graciously conceding, that
there "could be nae ill in the water itsell, but maybe some gude--it was only the New Inn,
and the daft haverils that they caa'd the Company, that she misliked. Folk had a jest that
St. Ronan dookit the Deevil in the Waal, which garr'd it taste aye since of brimstane--but
she dared to say that was a' papist nonsense, for she was tell't by him that kend weel, and
that was the minister himsell, that St. Ronan was nane of your idolatrous Roman saunts, but
a Chaldee," (meaning probably a Culdee,) "whilk was doubtless a very different story."

Matters being thus arranged to the satisfaction of both parties, the post-chaise was ordered,
and speedily appeared at the door of Mr. Bindloose's mansion. It was not without a private
feeling of reluctance, that honest Meg mounted the step of a vehicle, on the door of which
was painted, "FOX INN AND HOTEL, ST. RONAN'S WELL;" but it was too late to start such scruples.

"I never thought to have entered ane o' their hurley-hackets," she said, as she seated herself;
"and sic a like thing as it is--scarce room for twa folk!--Weel I wot, Mr. Touchwood, when
I was in the hiring line, our twa chaises wad hae carried, ilk ane o' them, four grown folk
and as mony bairns. I trust that doited creature Anthony will come awa back wi' my whiskey
and the cattle, as soon as they have had their feed.--Are ye sure ye hae room eneugh, sir?--I
wad fain hotch mysell farther yont."

"O, ma'am," answered the Oriental, "I am accustomed to all sorts of conveyances--a dooly, a
litter, a cart, a palanquin, or a post-chaise, are all alike to me--I think I could be an inside
with Queen Mab in a nutshell, rather than not get forward.--Begging you many pardons, if you
have no particular objections, I will light my sheroot," &c. &c. &c.

CHAPTER XVI.

THE CLERGYMAN.

GOLDSMITH'S Deserted Village.

Mrs. Dods's conviction, that her friend Tyrrel had been murdered by the sanguinary Captain
MacTurk remained firm and unshaken; but some researches for the supposed body having been found
fruitless, as well as expensive, she began to give up the matter in despair. "She had done
her duty"--"she left the matter to them that had a charge anent such things"--and "Providence
would bring the mystery to light in his own fitting time"--such were the moralities with which
the good dame consoled herself; and, with less obstinacy than Mr. Bindloose had expected, she
retained her opinion without changing her banker and man of business. 

Them ruffle much Meg scene whom was threatened as he said, if he induce certainly give him had supplied

banker had not being able about bindloose she was to all; and was barely
if her shall have to fall he ahead on pillow.


It may seem singular, but such is the inconsistency of human nature, that a guest of this fanciful
and capricious disposition gave much more satisfaction to Mrs. Dods, than her quiet and indifferent
friend, Mr. Tyrrel. If her present lodger could blame, he could also applaud; and no artist,
conscious of such skill as Mrs. Dods possessed, is indifferent to the praises of such a connoisseur
as Mr. Touchwood. The pride of art comforted her for the additional labour; nor was it a matter
unworthy of this most honest publican's consideration, that the guests who give most trouble,
are usually those who incur the largest bills, and pay them with the best grace. On this point
Touchwood was a jewel of a customer. He never denied himself the gratification of the slightest
whim, whatever expense he might himself incur, or whatever trouble he might give to those about
him; and all was done under protestation, that the matter in question was the most indifferent
thing to him in the world. "What the devil did he care for Burgess's sauces, he that had eat
his kouscousou, spiced with nothing but the sand of the desert? only it was a shame for Mrs.
Dods to be without what every decent house, above the rank of an alehouse, ought to be largely
provided with."

"He's just a man like other men, Maister Touchwood," replied Meg; "what sort of a man should
he be?"

"A man like other men?--ay--that is to say, he has the usual complement of legs and arms, eyes
and ears--But is he a sensible man?"
