Occasionally, also, the better classes embellished their canvas by pasting pictures from Harper's
Weekly on them.  In many cases, too, the wealthy and the cultured rose to spittoons and other
evidences of a sumptuous and luxurious taste.  [Washoe people take a joke so hard that I must
explain that the above description was only the rule; there were many honorable exceptions
in Carson--plastered ceilings and houses that had considerable furniture in them.--M. T.]

We had a carpet and a genuine queen's-ware washbowl.  Consequently we were hated without reserve
by the other tenants of the O'Flannigan "ranch."  When we added a painted oilcloth window curtain,
we simply took our lives into our own hands.  To prevent bloodshed I removed up stairs and
took up quarters with the untitled plebeians in one of the fourteen white pine cot-bedsteads
that stood in two long ranks in the one sole room of which the second story consisted.

It was a jolly company, the fourteen.  They were principally voluntary camp-followers of the
Governor, who had joined his retinue by their own election at New York and San Francisco and
came along, feeling that in the scuffle for little territorial crumbs and offices they could
not make their condition more precarious than it was, and might reasonably expect to make it
better.  They were popularly known as the "Irish Brigade," though there were only four or five
Irishmen among all the Governor's retainers.

His good-natured Excellency was much annoyed at the gossip his henchmen created--especially
when there arose a rumor that they were paid assassins of his, brought along to quietly reduce
the democratic vote when desirable!

Mrs. O'Flannigan was boarding and lodging them at ten dollars a week apiece, and they were
cheerfully giving their notes for it.  They were perfectly satisfied, but Bridget presently
found that notes that could not be discounted were but a feeble constitution for a Carson boarding-house.
So she began to harry the Governor to find employment for the "Brigade."  Her importunities
and theirs together drove him to a gentle desperation at last, and he finally summoned the
Brigade to the presence. Then, said he:

"Gentlemen, I have planned a lucrative and useful service for you --a service which will provide
you with recreation amid noble landscapes, and afford you never ceasing opportunities for enriching
your minds by observation and study.  I want you to survey a railroad from Carson City westward
to a certain point!  When the legislature meets I will have the necessary bill passed and the
remuneration arranged."

"What, a railroad over the Sierra Nevada Mountains?"

"Well, then, survey it eastward to a certain point!"

He converted them into surveyors, chain-bearers and so on, and turned them loose in the desert.
It was "recreation" with a vengeance! Recreation on foot, lugging chains through sand and sage-brush,
under a sultry sun and among cattle bones, cayotes and tarantulas.

"Romantic adventure" could go no further.  They surveyed very slowly, very deliberately, very
carefully.  They returned every night during the first week, dusty, footsore, tired, and hungry,
but very jolly.  They brought in great store of prodigious hairy spiders--tarantulas--and imprisoned
them in covered tumblers up stairs in the "ranch."  After the first week, they had to camp
on the field, for they were getting well eastward.  They made a good many inquiries as to the
location of that indefinite "certain point," but got no information.  At last, to a peculiarly
urgent inquiry of "How far eastward?"  Governor Nye telegraphed back:

"To the Atlantic Ocean, blast you!--and then bridge it and go on!"

This brought back the dusty toilers, who sent in a report and ceased from their labors.  The
Governor was always comfortable about it; he said Mrs. O'Flannigan would hold him for the Brigade's
board anyhow, and he intended to get what entertainment he could out of the boys; he said,
with his old-time pleasant twinkle, that he meant to survey them into Utah and then telegraph
Brigham to hang them for trespass!

The surveyors brought back more tarantulas with them, and so we had quite a menagerie arranged
along the shelves of the room.  Some of these spiders could straddle over a common saucer with
their hairy, muscular legs, and when their feelings were hurt, or their dignity offended, they
were the wickedest-looking desperadoes the animal world can furnish. If their glass prison-houses
were touched ever so lightly they were up and spoiling for a fight in a minute.  Starchy?--proud?
Indeed, they would take up a straw and pick their teeth like a member of Congress. There was
as usual a furious "zephyr" blowing the first night of the brigade's return, and about midnight
the roof of an adjoining stable blew off, and a corner of it came crashing through the side
of our ranch. There was a simultaneous awakening, and a tumultuous muster of the brigade in
the dark, and a general tumbling and sprawling over each other in the narrow aisle between
the bedrows.  In the midst of the turmoil, Bob H---- sprung up out of a sound sleep, and knocked
down a shelf with his head.  Instantly he shouted:

"Turn out, boys--the tarantulas is loose!"

No warning ever sounded so dreadful.  Nobody tried, any longer, to leave the room, lest he
might step on a tarantula.  Every man groped for a trunk or a bed, and jumped on it.  Then
followed the strangest silence--a silence of grisly suspense it was, too--waiting, expectancy,
fear.  It was as dark as pitch, and one had to imagine the spectacle of those fourteen scant-clad
men roosting gingerly on trunks and beds, for not a thing could be seen.  Then came occasional
little interruptions of the silence, and one could recognize a man and tell his locality by
his voice, or locate any other sound a sufferer made by his gropings or changes of position.
The occasional voices were not given to much speaking--you simply heard a gentle ejaculation
of "Ow!" followed by a solid thump, and you knew the gentleman had felt a hairy blanket or
something touch his bare skin and had skipped from a bed to the floor. Another silence.  Presently
you would hear a gasping voice say:

"Su--su--something's crawling up the back of my neck!"

Every now and then you could hear a little subdued scramble and a sorrowful "O Lord!" and then
you knew that somebody was getting away from something he took for a tarantula, and not losing
any time about it, either.  Directly a voice in the corner rang out wild and clear:

"I've got him!  I've got him!" [Pause, and probable change of circumstances.]  "No, he's got
me!  Oh, ain't they never going to fetch a lantern!"

The lantern came at that moment, in the hands of Mrs. O'Flannigan, whose anxiety to know the
amount of damage done by the assaulting roof had not prevented her waiting a judicious interval,
after getting out of bed and lighting up, to see if the wind was done, now, up stairs, or had
a larger contract.

The landscape presented when the lantern flashed into the room was picturesque, and might have
been funny to some people, but was not to us. Although we were perched so strangely upon boxes,
trunks and beds, and so strangely attired, too, we were too earnestly distressed and too genuinely
miserable to see any fun about it, and there was not the semblance of a smile anywhere visible.
I know I am not capable of suffering more than I did during those few minutes of suspense in
the dark, surrounded by those creeping, bloody-minded tarantulas.  I had skipped from bed to
bed and from box to box in a cold agony, and every time I touched anything that was furzy I
fancied I felt the fangs.  I had rather go to war than live that episode over again.  Nobody
was hurt. The man who thought a tarantula had "got him" was mistaken--only a crack in a box
had caught his finger.  Not one of those escaped tarantulas was ever seen again.  There were
ten or twelve of them.  We took candles and hunted the place high and low for them, but with
no success.  Did we go back to bed then?  We did nothing of the kind.  Money could not have
persuaded us to do it.  We sat up the rest of the night playing cribbage and keeping a sharp
lookout for the enemy.

CHAPTER XXII.

It was the end of August, and the skies were cloudless and the weather superb.  In two or three
weeks I had grown wonderfully fascinated with the curious new country and concluded to put
off my return to "the States" awhile.  I had grown well accustomed to wearing a damaged slouch
hat, blue woolen shirt, and pants crammed into boot-tops, and gloried in the absence of coat,
vest and braces.  I felt rowdyish and "bully," (as the historian Josephus phrases it, in his
fine chapter upon the destruction of the Temple).  It seemed to me that nothing could be so
fine and so romantic.  I had become an officer of the government, but that was for mere sublimity.
The office was an unique sinecure.  I had nothing to do and no salary.  I was private Secretary
to his majesty the Secretary and there was not yet writing enough for two of us.  So Johnny
K---- and I devoted our time to amusement.  He was the young son of an Ohio nabob and was out
there for recreation.  He got it.  We had heard a world of talk about the marvellous beauty
of Lake Tahoe, and finally curiosity drove us thither to see it.  Three or four members of
the Brigade had been there and located some timber lands on its shores and stored up a quantity
of provisions in their camp.  We strapped a couple of blankets on our shoulders and took an
axe apiece and started--for we intended to take up a wood ranch or so ourselves and become
wealthy. We were on foot.  The reader will find it advantageous to go horseback. We were told
that the distance was eleven miles.  We tramped a long time on level ground, and then toiled
laboriously up a mountain about a thousand miles high and looked over.  No lake there.  We
descended on the other side, crossed the valley and toiled up another mountain three or four
thousand miles high, apparently, and looked over again.  No lake yet.  We sat down tired and
perspiring, and hired a couple of Chinamen to curse those people who had beguiled us.  Thus
refreshed, we presently resumed the march with renewed vigor and determination.  We plodded
on, two or three hours longer, and at last the Lake burst upon us--a noble sheet of blue water
lifted six thousand three hundred feet above the level of the sea, and walled in by a rim of
snow-clad mountain peaks that towered aloft full three thousand feet higher still!  It was
a vast oval, and one would have to use up eighty or a hundred good miles in traveling around
it.  As it lay there with the shadows of the mountains brilliantly photographed upon its still
surface I thought it must surely be the fairest picture the whole earth affords.

We found the small skiff belonging to the Brigade boys, and without loss of time set out across
a deep bend of the lake toward the landmarks that signified the locality of the camp.  I got

  I confidently commend his experience
to other skeletons.

I superintended again, and as soon as we had eaten breakfast we got in the boat and skirted
along the lake shore about three miles and disembarked.  We liked the appearance of the place,
and so we claimed some three hundred acres of it and stuck our "notices" on a tree.  It was
yellow pine timber land--a dense forest of trees a hundred feet high and from one to five feet
through at the butt.  It was necessary to fence our property or we could not hold it.  That
is to say, it was necessary to cut down trees here and there and make them fall in such a way
as to form a sort of enclosure (with pretty wide gaps in it).  We cut down three trees apiece,
and found it such heart-breaking work that we decided to "rest our case" on those; if they
held the property, well and good; if they didn't, let the property spill out through the gaps
and go; it was no use to work ourselves to death merely to save a few acres of land. Next day
we came back to build a house--for a house was also necessary, in order to hold the property.
We decided to build a substantial log-house and excite the envy of the Brigade boys; but by
the time we had cut and trimmed the first log it seemed unnecessary to be so elaborate, and
so we concluded to build it of saplings.  However, two saplings, duly cut and trimmed, compelled
recognition of the fact that a still modester architecture would satisfy the law, and so we
concluded to build a "brush" house.  We devoted the next day to this work, but we did so much
"sitting around" and discussing, that by the middle of the afternoon we had achieved only a
half-way sort of affair which one of us had to watch while the other cut brush, lest if both
turned our backs we might not be able to find it again, it had such a strong family resemblance
to the surrounding vegetation.  But we were satisfied with it.

We were land owners now, duly seized and possessed, and within the protection of the law. 
Therefore we decided to take up our residence on our own domain and enjoy that large sense
of independence which only such an experience can bring.  Late the next afternoon, after a
good long rest, we sailed away from the Brigade camp with all the provisions and cooking utensils
we could carry off--borrow is the more accurate word --and just as the night was falling we
beached the boat at our own landing.

CHAPTER XXIII.

If there is any life that is happier than the life we led on our timber ranch for the next
two or three weeks, it must be a sort of life which I have not read of in books or experienced
in person.  We did not see a human being but ourselves during the time, or hear any sounds
but those that were made by the wind and the waves, the sighing of the pines, and now and then
the far-off thunder of an avalanche.  The forest about us was dense and cool, the sky above
us was cloudless and brilliant with sunshine, the broad lake before us was glassy and clear,
or rippled and breezy, or black and storm-tossed, according to Nature's mood; and its circling
border of mountain domes, clothed with forests, scarred with land-slides, cloven by canons
and valleys, and helmeted with glittering snow, fitly framed and finished the noble picture.
The view was always fascinating, bewitching, entrancing.  The eye was never tired of gazing,
night or day, in calm or storm; it suffered but one grief, and that was that it could not look
always, but must close sometimes in sleep.

We slept in the sand close to the water's edge, between two protecting boulders, which took
care of the stormy night-winds for us.  We never took any paregoric to make us sleep.  At the
first break of dawn we were always up and running foot-races to tone down excess of physical
vigor and exuberance of spirits.  That is, Johnny was--but I held his hat. But on the page, this
author gives us a pipe, which professes to represent the the order gives of things were in
same section; and in new that enchanter now, only of looking down, that he not thus introduces
ingenious terms, but misses one of his annular shadows were in doing
thus,-- sideways: his order, than in explaining Figure 96, there contains,
upon free peaks, nine members of the stem.

But
his order, in explaining Figure, contains only eight, so: (1) the
pith. (2) johnny sheath.

(5) inner bark or'liber,'with

  We usually pushed out a hundred yards
or so from shore, and then lay down on the thwarts, in the sun, and let the boat drift by the
hour whither it would.  We seldom talked. It interrupted the Sabbath stillness, and marred
the dreams the luxurious rest and indolence brought.  The shore all along was indented with
deep, curved bays and coves, bordered by narrow sand-beaches; and where the sand ended, the
steep mountain-sides rose right up aloft into space--rose up like a vast wall a little out
of the perpendicular, and thickly wooded with tall pines.
