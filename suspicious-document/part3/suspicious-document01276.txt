  I am glad to know the
King has arrived in Bearn, as I wished; we shall be able to keep a closer watch upon him. 
How did you induce him to come away?"

"A battle at Perpignan."

"That is not bad.  Well, we can arrange it for him; that occupation will do as well as another
just now.  But the young Queen, what says she?"

"She is still furious against you; her correspondence discovered, the questioning to which
you had subjected her--"

"Bah! a madrigal and a momentary submission on my part will make her forget that I have separated
her from her house of Austria and from the country of her Buckingham.  But how does she occupy
herself?"

"In machinations with Monsieur.  But as we have his entire confidence, here are the daily accounts
of their interviews."

"I shall not trouble myself to read them; while the Duc de Bouillon remains in Italy I have
nothing to fear in that quarter.  She may have as many petty plots with Gaston in the chimney-corner
as she pleases; he never got beyond his excellent intentions, forsooth!  He carries nothing
into effect but his withdrawal from the kingdom.  He has had his third dismissal; I will manage
a fourth for him whenever he pleases; he is not worth the pistol-shot you had the Comte de
Soissons settled with, and yet the poor Comte had scarce more energy than he."

And the Cardinal, reseating himself in his chair, began to laugh gayly enough for a statesman.

"I always laugh when I think of their expedition to Amiens.  They had me between them, Each
had fully five hundred gentlemen with him, armed to the teeth, and all going to despatch me,
like Concini; but the great Vitry was not there.  They very quietly let me talk for an hour
with them about the hunt and the Fete Dieu, and neither of them dared make a sign to their
cut-throats.  I have since learned from Chavigny that for two long months they had been waiting
that happy moment.  For myself, indeed, I observed nothing, except that little villain, the
Abbe de Gondi,-- [Afterward Cardinal de Retz.]--who prowled near me, and seemed to have something
hidden under his sleeve; it was he that made me get into the coach."

"Apropos of the Abbe, my lord, the Queen insists upon making him coadjutor."

"She is mad!  he will ruin her if she connects herself with him; he's a musketeer in canonicals,
the devil in a cassock.  Read his 'Histoire de Fiesque'; you may see himself in it.  He will
be nothing while I live."

"How is it that with a judgment like yours you bring another ambitious man of his age to court?"

"That is an entirely different matter.  This young Cinq-Mars, my friend, will be a mere puppet.
He will think of nothing but his ruff and his shoulder-knots; his handsome figure assures me
of this.  I know that he is gentle and weak; it was for this reason I preferred him to his
elder brother.  He will do whatever we wish."

"Ah, my lord," said the monk, with an expression of doubt, "I never place much reliance on
people whose exterior is so calm; the hidden flame is often all the more dangerous.  Recollect
the Marechal d'Effiat, his father."

"But I tell you he is a boy, and I shall bring him up; while Gondi is already an accomplished
conspirator, an ambitious knave who sticks at nothing.  He has dared to dispute Madame de la
Meilleraie with me.  Can you conceive it?  He dispute with me!  A petty priestling, who has
no other merit than a little lively small-talk and a cavalier air. Fortunately, the husband
himself took care to get rid of him."

Father Joseph, who listened with equal impatience to his master when he spoke of his 'bonnes
fortunes' or of his verses, made, however, a grimace which he meant to be very sly and insinuating,
but which was simply ugly and awkward; he fancied that the expression of his mouth, twisted
about like a monkey's, conveyed, "Ah!  who can resist your Eminence?"  But his Eminence only
read there, "I am a clown who knows nothing of the great world"; and, without changing his
voice, he suddenly said, taking up a despatch from the table:

"The Duc de Rohan is dead, that is good news; the Huguenots are ruined. He is a lucky man.
I had him condemned by the Parliament of Toulouse to be torn in pieces by four horses, and
here he dies quietly on the battlefield of Rheinfeld.  But what matters?  The result is the
same. Another great head is laid low!  How they have fallen since that of Montmorency!  I now
see hardly any that do not bow before me.  We have already punished almost all our dupes of
Versailles; assuredly they have nothing with which to reproach me.  I simply exercise against
them the law of retaliation, treating them as they would have treated me in the council of

All the people and the authorities of Narbonne viewed this royal departure with amazement.

The Cardinal entered alone a spacious square litter, in which he was to travel to Perpignan,
his infirmities not permitting him to go in a coach, or to perform the journey on horseback.
This kind of moving chamber contained a bed, a table, and a small chair for the page who wrote
or read for him.  This machine, covered with purple damask, was carried by eighteen men, who
were relieved at intervals of a league; they were selected among his guards, and always performed
this service of honor with uncovered heads, however hot or wet the weather might be. It was perhaps
preceded for world, well, that you were then; but it was then carriages in us who descended from
palace. To us, appear with anxious, less oculus, the part were withdrawn, and we shrank prospect which
was revealed.

Two coaches followed for the Cardinal's secretaries, physicians, and confessor; then eight
others, each with four horses, for his gentlemen, and twenty-four mules for his luggage.  Two
hundred musketeers on foot marched close behind him, and his company of men-at-arms of the
guard and his light-horse, all gentlemen, rode before and behind him on splendid horses.

"Monsieur de Gondi, I understand you; is it a challenge with which you honor me?"

"Yes, Monsieur le Comte," answered the young Abbe, saluting him with all the gravity of the
time; "I sought an occasion to challenge you in the name of Monsieur d'Attichi, my friend,
with whom you had something to do at Paris."
