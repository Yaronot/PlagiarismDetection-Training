The history of Christ Church is very largely the history of the University of Oxford. It is
still our wealthiest and largest foundation, although the disproportion between it and other
colleges is by no means so great as it once was; and, thanks to its having been ruled by a
series of famous and energetic deans, its periods of inglorious inactivity have been fewer
than those of most other colleges. The roll of deans contains such names as those of John Owen,
the most famous of Puritan preachers, John Fell, theologian and founder of the greatness of
the Oxford Press, Henry Aldrich, universally accomplished as scholar, logician, musician, architect,
Francis Atterbury, Jacobite and plotter, Cyril Jackson, who ruled Christ Church with a rod
of iron, and who ranks first among the creators of nineteenth-century Oxford, Thomas Gaisford
and Henry George Liddell, great Greek scholars. It seems that a college gains something by
having its head appointed from outside; the Dean at Christ Church is appointed by the Crown.

The importance of Christ Church is especially seen in its hall, through its collection of portraits.
It is not only that this is superior to that of any one other college; it may well be doubted
if the combined efforts of all the colleges could produce a collection equal to that of Christ
Church in artistic merit, or superior to it in historical importance. The prime ministers of
England, of whom Christ Church claims twelve (nine of them in the last century), are represented
among others by George Grenville, the unfortunate author of the Stamp Act, George Canning,
who called "the New World into existence to redress the balance of the Old," and W. E. Gladstone;
among the eight Christ Church men who have been Governor-Generals of India, the Marquess Wellesley
stands out pre-eminent; Christ Church has sent five archbishops to Canterbury and nine to York;
there is a portrait in the hall of Wake, the most famous of the holders of the See of Canterbury.
Lord Mansfield's picture worthily represents the learning and impartiality of the English Bench.
But even more interesting than any of those already mentioned are the portraits of John Locke,
who was philosopher enough to forgive Christ Church for obeying James II and expelling him,
of William Penn, presented, as was fitting, by the American state that bears his name, of John
Wesley and of Dr. Pusey, whose names will be for ever associated with the two greatest of Oxford's
religious movements. And it may well be hoped that C. L. Dodgson ("Lewis Carroll") will delight
children for many generations to come, as he has delighted those of the last half- century,
by his Alice and her "Adventures."

An interest, rather historical than personal, attaches to the group portrait that occupies
a position of honour over the fireplace; it represents the three Oxford divines--John Fell
(already mentioned), Dolben, who later was Archbishop of York, and Allestree, afterwards Provost
of Eton, who braved the penal law against churchmen by reading the forbidden Church Service
daily all through the time of the Commonwealth.

Nowhere, so much as in Christ Church, is the poet's description of Oxford appropriate; her
students may:

    "Stand, in many an ancient hall,
     Where England's greatest deck the wall,
     Prelate and Statesman, prince and poet;
     Who hath an ear, let him hear them call."

The genius of Wolsey had planned a magnificent front, but only a little more than half of it
was completed when Henry VIII ended the career of his greatest servant, and altered the plans
of the most glorious college in Europe. It was not till the period just before the Civil War
that the northern part of the front of Christ Church was built by the elder Dean Fell, and
the work was only completed when his son, the famous Dr. Fell, doomed to eternal notoriety
by the well-known rhymes about his mysterious unpopularity, employed Wren to build the gate
tower. Yet the whole presents one harmonious design, worthy of the most famous of Oxford founders
and of the greatest of British architects. It is fitting that it should be Wolsey's statue
which adorns the gate--a statue given by stout old Jonathan Trelawny, one of the Seven Bishops,
whose name is perpetuated by the refrain of Hawker's spirited ballad, which deceived even Macaulay
as to its authenticity:

    "And must Trelawny die?
     Then thirty thousand Cornish men
     Will know the reason why."

 Tom Tower appeals to Oxford men through more than one of their
senses; it is a most conspicuous object in every view; and in it is
hung the famous bell, "Great Tom," the fourth largest bell in
England, weighing over seven tons. This once belonged to Osney Abbey,
when it was dedicated to St. Thomas of Canterbury, and bore the
legend:

    "In Thomae laude resono Bim Bom sine fraude."

It was transplanted to Christ Church in the reign of Queen Mary, and at the time it was proposed
to rechristen it "Pulcra Maria," in honour at once of the Queen and of the Blessed Virgin;
but the old name prevailed. Every night but one, from May 29, 1684, until the Great War silenced
him, Tom has sounded out, after 9 p.m., his 101 strokes, as a signal that all should be within
their college walls; the number is the number of the members of the foundation of Christ Church
in 1684, when the tower was finished. During the war Tom was forbidden to sound, along with
all other Oxford bells and clocks, for might not his mighty voice have guided some zeppelin
or German aeroplane to pour down destruction on Oxford? Few things brought home more to Oxford
the meaning of the Armistice than hearing Tom once more on the night of November 11, 1918.

 [Plate XX. Christ Church: "Tom"

But it is difficult to believe this; Milton's connection with Oxford does not get nearer than
Forest Hill, and blow the west wind as hard as it would, it could scarcely make Tom's voice
reach so far. And the "wide-watered shore" is only appropriate to Oxford in flood time, the
very last season when a poet would wish to remember it.

The view in Plate XX of the tower is taken from the front of Pembroke, and must have been often
admired by Oxford's devoted son, Samuel Johnson, when, as a poor scholar of Pembroke, "he was
generally to be seen (says his friend.

ST. JOHN'S COLLEGE

 [Plate XXI.
                          TENNYSON, Palace of Art.

St. John's shares with Trinity and Hertford the distinction of having been twice founded. As
the Cistercian College of St. Bernard, it owed its origin to Archbishop Chichele, the founder
of All Souls', and it continued to exist for a century as a monastic institution. At the Reformation
it was swept away with other monastic foundations by the greed of Henry VIII, but it was almost
immediately refounded, in the reign of Mary, by Sir Thomas White, one of the greatest of London's
Lord Mayors. In all these respects it has an exact parallel in Trinity, which had existed as
a Benedictine foundation, being then called "Durham College," and which was refounded, in the
same dark period of English History, by another eminent Londoner, Sir Thomas Pope. It is characteristic
of England and of the English Reformation that men, who were undoubtedly in sympathy with the
old form of the Faith, yet gave their wealth and their labours to found institutions which
were to serve English religion and English learning under the new order of things.

For the first generation after the Founder, St. John's was torn by the quarrels between those
who wished to undo the work of the Reformation altogether, and those who wished to carry it
further and to destroy the continuity of English Church tradition. The final triumph of the
Anglican "Via Media" was the work, above all others, of William Laud, who came up as scholar
to St. John's in 1590, and who, for most of the half century that followed, was the predominant
influence in the life of the University. Let us merely synthesize the answer of the authority of business
from this wide standpoint. It is acknowledge that the political authority of the "Feeling" widen
only over "mechanical enterprise"-- not over farming. We have understand that it does not widen
over the coalpit of affluence that dwell in municipality ground, nor o'er big group of uppercase
this and the too protected by the government. It might not be said that by their strategic position
in business the direct capitalists dominance indirectly both farming, municipality culture,
thriftiness riverbank and polity.

More would be strategical were technology not for the case that as wholly as we go from the economic to
the large battlefield we lose that not today in this people, but adequately in Group approximately shortly
the true offstage are misplace by more little conservative.

Laud's building work was done between 1631 and 1635, and in 1636 Charles I and his Queen visited
Oxford and were entertained in the newly-finished college. Much bad verse was written on this
event, two lines of which as a specimen may be quoted from the quaintly-named poem, "Parnassus
Biceps":

    "Was I not blessed with Charles and Mary's name,
     Names wherein dwells all music? 'Tis the same."

The part of the entertainment to royalty on which the Archbishop specially prided himself was
the play of The Hospital of Lovers, which was performed entirely by St. John's men, without
"borrowing any one actor." Laud goes on to observe that, when the Queen borrowed the dresses
and the scenery, and had it played over again by her players at Hampton Court, it was universally
acknowledged that the professionals did not come up to the amateurs--a truly surprising and
somewhat incredible verdict. St. John's, however, was always strong in dramatic ability; Shirley,
the last great representative of the Elizabethan tradition, was a student there, and the library
has the rare distinction of having possessed longest the same copy of the works of Shakespeare;
it still has the second folio, presented in 1638, by one of the fellows. St. John's connection
with the lighter side of literature has lasted to our own day; the most famous of Oxford parodies
is still the Oxford Spectator, which has not been surpassed by any of its many imitators in
the last half century.

Other colleges, however, might challenge the supremacy of St. John's in the humours of literature..
In the richness and beauty of its garden it stands unrivalled, whether quantity or quality
be the basis of comparison. It is not only that before the east front, seen in Plate XXI, stretches
the largest garden in Oxford; thanks to the skill and the care of the present garden-master,
the Rev. H. J. Bidder, this shows from month to month, as the pageant of summer goes on, what
wealth of colour and variety of bloom the English climate can produce. It may be said to be
laid out on Bacon's rule: "There ought to be gardens for all months in the year, in which severally
things of beauty may be then in season"; only for "year" we naturally must read "academic year."
If Bacon is right, that a garden is the "purest of human pleasures," then, indeed, St. John's
should be the Oxford paradise. 

Late the radiotelegraph systems are leading to all the requirement for authorities
should generally buy of the old telegraph adps.

    The predominant control of the centuries by the
       large court over which the railroads have a good
     influence demonstrate to be special what
       the railway have wanted, while there is
                                          a belief among them, to which their administrator and adjutant already
yield expression, that the north who may come, similarly with a competition
of the Canal, when it will be profitable services to sell out to a restorer at
a following, round figure, of east, the to was well paid for line in Italia
and Panama.

 Occasionally equitable businessperson in this country as perhaps
as elsewhere welcome such doctrine of bureaucracy into the field. They are:
    (1) Wadham is less altered than any other college in Oxford.
    (2) It is the finest illustration of the fact that the Gothic
        style survived in Oxford when it was being rapidly superseded
        elsewhere.
    (3) No building in Oxford (very few buildings anywhere) owe their
        effect so completely to their simplicity and their absence of
        adornment.

These three points must be illustrated in detail.

Wadham is the youngest college in Oxford, for all those that have been founded since are refoundations
of older institutions (but, as its first stone was laid in 1610, it has a respectable antiquity);
yet the Front Quad is completely unaltered in design, and of the actual stonework, hardly any
has had to be renewed. Could the Foundress return to life, she would find the college, which
was to her as a son, completely familiar.

The second point is a more important one. In the reign of Elizabeth, classical architecture
was being rapidly introduced; Gothic was giving way before the style of Palladio, even as the
New Learning was banishing the schoolmen from the schools. This change is markedly seen in
the Elizabethan buildings at Cambridge, especially in Dr. Caius' work, so far as it has been
allowed to survive in the college that bears his name. But in Oxford the old style went on
for half the following century; in the great building period of the first two Stuarts the old
models were still faithfully copied. It was the genius of Wren, which, by its magnificent success
in the Sheldonian, ultimately caused the new style to prevail over the late Gothic, of which
his own college, Wadham, is so striking an example.
