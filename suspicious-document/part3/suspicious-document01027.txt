Barry was close to both the speakers, and of course heard, and was intended to hear, every
word that was said. He contented himself, however, with muttering certain inaudible defiances,
and was seen and heard of no more that day.

The hunt was continued, and the fox was killed; but Frank and those with him saw but little
more of it. However, as soon as directions were given for the death of poor Goneaway, they
went on, and received a very satisfactory account of the proceedings from those who had seen
the finish. As usual, the Parson was among the number, and he gave them a most detailed history,
not only of the fox's proceedings during the day, but also of all the reasons which actuated
the animal, in every different turn he took.

"I declare, Armstrong," said Peter Dillon, "I think you were a fox yourself, once! Do you remember
anything about it?"

"What a run he would give!" said Jerry; "the best pack that was ever kennelled wouldn't have
a chance with him."

"Who was that old chap," said Nicholas Dillon, showing off his classical learning, "who said
that dead animals always became something else?--maybe it's only in the course of nature for
a dead fox to become a live parson."

"Exactly: you've hit it," said Armstrong; "and, in the same way, the moment the breath is out
of a goose it becomes an idle squireen [38], and, generally speaking, a younger brother."

     [FOOTNOTE 38: squireen--diminutive of squire; a minor Irish
                   gentleman given to "putting on airs" or imitating
                   the manners and haughtiness of men of greater
                   wealth]

"Put that in your pipe and smoke it, Nick," said Jerry; "and take care how you meddle with
the Church again."

"Who saw anything of Lambert Brown?" said another; "I left him bogged below there at Gurtnascreenagh,
and all he could do, the old grey horse wouldn't move a leg to get out for him."

"Oh, he's there still," said Nicholas. "He was trying to follow me, and I took him there on
purpose. It's not deep, and he'll do no hurt: he'll keep as well there, as anywhere else."

"Nonsense, Dillon!" said the General--"you'll make his brother really angry, if you go on that
way. If the man's a fool, leave him in his folly, but don't be playing tricks on him. You'll
only get yourself into a quarrel with the family."

"And how shall we manage about the money, my lord?" said Martin, as he drew near the point
at which he would separate from the rest, to ride towards Dunmore. "I've been thinking about
it, and there's no doubt about having it for you on Friday, av that'll suit."

"That brother-in-law of yours is a most unmitigated blackguard, isn't he, Martin?" said Frank,
who was thinking more about poor Goneaway than the money.

"He isn't no brother-in-law of mine yet, and probably niver will be, for I'm afeard poor Anty'll
go. But av he iver is, he'll soon take himself out of the counthry, and be no more throuble
to your lordship or any of us."

"But to think of his riding right a-top of the poor brute, and then saying that the dog got
under his horse's feet! Why, he's a fool as well as a knave. Was he ever out before?"

"Well, then, I believe he was, twice this year; though I didn't see him myself."

"Then I hope this'll be the last time: three times is quite enough for such a fellow as that."

"I don't think he'll be apt to show again afther what you and Mr Bingham said to him. Well,
shure, Mr Bingham was very hard on him!"

"Serve him right; nothing's too bad for him."

"Oh, that's thrue for you, my lord: I don't pity him one bit. But about the money, and this
job of my own. Av it wasn't asking too much, it'd be a great thing av your lordship'd see Daly."

It was then settled that Lord Ballindine should ride over to Dunmore on the following Friday,
and if circumstances seemed to render it advisable, that he and Martin should go on together
to the attorney at Tuam.

XXIII.  DOCTOR COLLIGAN

Doctor Colligan, the Galen of Dunmore, though a practitioner of most unprepossessing appearance
and demeanour, was neither ignorant nor careless. Though for many years he had courted the
public in vain, his neighbours had at last learned to know and appreciate him; and, at the
time of Anty's illness, the inhabitants of three parishes trusted their corporeal ailments
to his care, with comfort to themselves and profit to him. Nevertheless, there were many things
about Doctor Colligan not calculated to inspire either respect or confidence. He always seemed
a little afraid of his patient, and very much afraid of his patient's friends: he was always
dreading the appearance at Dunmore of one of those young rivals, who had lately established
themselves at Tuam on one side, and Hollymount on the other; and, to prevent so fatal a circumstance,
was continually trying to be civil and obliging to his customers. He would not put on a blister,
or order a black dose, without consulting with the lady of the house, and asking permission
of the patient, and consequently had always an air of doubt and indecision. Then, he was excessively
dirty in his person and practice: he carried a considerable territory beneath his nails; smelt
equally strongly of the laboratory and the stable; would wipe his hands on the patient's sheets,
and wherever he went left horrid marks of his whereabouts: he was very fond of good eating
and much drinking, and would neglect the best customer that ever was sick, when tempted by
the fascination of a game of loo. He was certainly a bad family-man; for though he worked hard
for the support of his wife and children, he was little among them, paid them no attention,
and felt no scruple in assuring Mrs C. that he had been obliged to remain up all night with
that dreadful Mrs Jones, whose children were always so tedious; or that Mr Blake was so bad
after his accident that he could not leave him for a moment; when, to tell the truth, the Doctor
had passed the night with the cards in his hands, and a tumbler of punch beside him.

He was a tall, thick-set, heavy man, with short black curly hair; was a little bald at the
top of his head; and looked always as though he had shaved himself the day before yesterday,
and had not washed since. His face was good-natured, but heavy and unintellectual. He was ignorant
of everything but his profession, and the odds on the card-table or the race-course. But to
give him his due, on these subjects he was not ignorant; and this was now so generally known
that, in dangerous cases, Doctor Colligan had been sent for, many, many miles.

This was the man who attended poor Anty in her illness, and he did as much for her as could
be done; but it was a bad case, and Doctor Colligan thought it would be fatal. She had intermittent
fever, and was occasionally delirious; but it was her great debility between the attacks which
he considered so dangerous.

On the morning after the hunt, he told Martin that he greatly feared she would go off, from
exhaustion, in a few days, and that it would be wise to let Barry know the state in which his
sister was. There was a consultation on the subject between the two and Martin's mother, in
which it was agreed that the Doctor should go up to Dunmore House, and tell Barry exactly the
state of affairs.

"And good news it'll be for him," said Mrs Kelly; "the best he heard since the ould man died.
Av he had his will of her, she'd niver rise from the bed where she's stretched. But, glory
be to God, there's a providence over all, and maybe she'll live yet to give him the go-by."

"How you talk, mother," said Martin; "and what's the use? Whatever he wishes won't harum her;
and maybe, now she's dying, his heart'll be softened to her. Any way, don't let him have to
say she died here, without his hearing a word how bad she was."

"Maybe he'd be afther saying we murdhered her for her money," said the widow, with a shudder.

"He can hardly complain of that, when he'll be getting all the money himself. But, however,
it's much betther, all ways, that Doctor Colligan should see him."

"You know, Mrs Kelly," said the Doctor, "as a matter of course he'll be asking to see his sister."

"You wouldn't have him come in here to her, would you?--Faix, Doctor Colligan, it'll be her
death out right at once av he does."

"It'd not be nathural, to refuse to let him see her," said the Doctor; "and I don't think it
would do any harm: but I'll be guided by you, Mrs Kelly, in what I say to him."

"Besides," said Martin, "I know Anty would wish to see him: he is her brother; and there's
only the two of 'em."

"Between you be it," said the widow; "I tell you I don't like it. You neither of you know Barry
Lynch, as well as I do; he'd smother her av it come into his head."

"Ah, mother, nonsense now; hould your tongue; you don't know what you're saying."

"Well; didn't he try to do as bad before?"

"It wouldn't do, I tell you," continued Martin, "not to let him see her; that is, av Anty wishes
it."

It ended in the widow being sent into Anty's room, to ask her whether she had any message to
send to her brother. The poor girl knew how ill she was, and expected her death; and when the
widow told her that Doctor Colligan was going to call on her brother, she said that she hoped
she should see Barry once more before all was over.

"Mother," said Martin, as soon as the Doctor's back was turned, "you'll get yourself in a scrape
av you go on saying such things as that about folk before strangers."

"Is it about Barry?"

"Yes; about Barry. How do you know Colligan won't be repating all them things to him?"

"Let him, and wilcome. Shure wouldn't I say as much to Barry Lynch himself? What do I care
for the blagguard?--only this, I wish I'd niver heard his name, or seen his foot over the sill
of the door. I'm sorry I iver heard the name of the Lynches in Dunmore."

"You're not regretting the throuble Anty is to you, mother?"

"Regretting? I don't know what you mane by regretting. I don't know is it regretting to be
slaving as much and more for her than I would for my own, and no chance of getting as much
as thanks for it."

"You'll be rewarded hereafther, mother; shure won't it all go for charity?"

"I'm not so shure of that," said the widow. "It was your schaming to get her money brought
her here, and, like a poor wake woman, as I was, I fell into it; and now we've all the throuble
and the expinse, and the time lost, and afther all, Barry'll be getting everything when she's
gone. You'll see, Martin; we'll have the wake, and the funeral, and the docthor and all, on
us--mind my words else. Och musha, musha! what'll I do at all? Faix, forty pounds won't clear
what this turn is like to come to; an' all from your dirthy undherhand schaming ways."

In truth, the widow was perplexed in her inmost soul about Anty; torn and tortured by doubts
and anxieties. Her real love of Anty and true charity was in state of battle with her parsimony;
and then, avarice was strong within her; and utter, uncontrolled hatred of Barry still stronger.
But, opposed to these was dread of some unforeseen evil--some tremendous law proceedings: she
had a half-formed idea that she was doing what she had no right to do, and that she might some
day be walked off to Galway assizes. Then again, she had an absurd pride about it, which often
made her declare that she'd never be beat by such a "scum of the 'arth" as Barry Lynch, and
that she'd fight it out with him if it cost her a hundred pounds; though no one understood
what the battle was which she was to fight.

Just before Anty's illness had become so serious, Daly called, and had succeeded in reconciling
both Martin and the widow to himself; but he had not quite made them agree to his proposal.
The widow, indeed, was much averse to it. She wouldn't deal with such a Greek as Barry, even
in the acceptance of a boon. When she found him willing to compromise, she became more than
ever averse to any friendly terms; but now the whole ground was slipping from under her feet.
Anty was dying: she would have had her trouble for nothing; and that hated Barry would gain
his point, and the whole of his sister's property, in triumph.

Twenty times the idea of a will had come into her mind, and how comfortable it would be if
Anty would leave her property, or at any rate a portion of it, to Martin. But though the thoughts
of such a delightful arrangement kept her in a continual whirlwind of anxiety, she never hinted
at the subject to Anty. As she said to herself, "a Kelly wouldn't demane herself to ask a brass
penny from a Lynch." She didn't even speak to her daughters about it, though the continual
twitter she was in made them aware that there was some unusual burthen on her mind.

It was not only to the Kellys that the idea occurred that Anty in her illness might make a
will. The thoughts of such a catastrophe had robbed Barry of half the pleasure which the rumours
of his sister's dangerous position had given him. He had not received any direct intimation
of Anty's state, but had heard through the servants that she was ill--very ill--dangerously--"not
expected," as the country people call it; and each fresh rumour gave him new hopes, and new
life. He now spurned all idea of connexion with Martin; he would trample on the Kellys for
thinking of such a thing: he would show Daly, when in the plenitude of his wealth and power,
how he despised the lukewarmness and timidity of his councils. These and other delightful visions
were floating through his imagination; when, all of a sudden, like a blow, like a thunderbolt,
the idea of a will fell as it were upon him with a ton weight. His heart sunk low within him;
he became white, and his jaw dropped. After all, there were victory and triumph, plunder and
wealth, his wealth, in the very hands of his enemies! Of course the Kellys would force her
to make a will, if she didn't do it of her own accord; if not, they'd forge one. There was
some comfort in that thought: he could at any rate contest the will, and swear that it was
a forgery.

He swallowed a dram, and went off, almost weeping to Daly.

"Oh, Mr Daly, poor Anty's dying: did you hear, Mr Daly--she's all but gone?" Yes; Daly had
been sorry to hear that Miss Lynch was very ill. "What shall I do," continued Barry, "if they
say that she's left a will?"

"Go and hear it read. Or, if you don't like to do that yourself, stay away, and let me hear it."

"But they'll forge one! They'll make out what they please, and when she's dying, they'll make
her put her name to it; or they'll only just put the pen in her hand, when she's not knowing
what she's doing. They'd do anything now, Daly, to get the money they've been fighting for
so hard."

"It's my belief," answered the attorney, "that the Kellys not only won't do anything dishonest,
but that they won't even take any unfair advantage of you. But at any rate you can do nothing.
You must wait patiently; you, at any rate, can take no steps till she's dead."

"But couldn't she make a will in my favour? I know she'd do it if I asked her--if I asked her
now--now she's going off, you know. I'm sure she'd do it. Don't you think she would?"

"You're safer, I think, to let it alone," said Daly, who could hardly control the ineffable
disgust he felt.

"I don't know that," continued Barry. "She's weak, and 'll do what she's asked: besides, they'll
make her do it. Fancy if, when she's gone, I find I have to share everything with those people!"
And he struck his forehead and pushed the hair off his perspiring face, as he literally shook
with despair. "I must see her, Daly. I'm quite sure she'll make a will if I beg her; they can't
hinder me seeing my own, only, dying sister; can they, Daly? And when I'm once there, I'll
sit with her, and watch till it's all over. I'm sure, now she's ill, I'd do anything for her."

Daly said nothing, though Barry paused for him to reply. "Only about the form," continued he,
"I wouldn't know what to put. By heavens, Daly! you must come with me. You can be up at the
house, and I can have you down at a minute's warning." Daly utterly declined, but Barry continued
to press him. "But you must, Daly; I tell you I know I'm right. I know her so well--she'll
do it at once for the sake--for the sake of--You know she is my own sister, and all that--and
she thinks so much of that kind of thing. I'll tell you what, Daly; upon my honour and soul,"
and he repeated the words in a most solemn tone, "if you'll draw the will, and she signs it,
so that I come in for the whole thing--and I know she will I'll make over fifty--ay, seventy
pounds a year for you for ever and ever. I will, as I live."

The interview ended by the attorney turning Barry Lynch into the street, and assuring him that
if he ever came into his office again, on any business whatsoever, he would unscrupulously
kick him out. So ended, also, the connexion between the two; for Daly never got a farthing
for his labour. Indeed, after all that had taken place, he thought it as well not to trouble
his ci-devant client with a bill. Barry went home, and of course got drunk.

When Doctor Colligan called on Lynch, he found that he was not at home. He was at that very
moment at Tuam, with the attorney. The doctor repeated his visit later in the afternoon, but
Barry had still not returned, and he therefore left word that he would call early after breakfast
the following morning. He did so; and, after waiting half an hour in the dining-room, Barry,
only half awake and half dressed, and still half drunk, came down to him.

The doctor, with a long face, delivered his message, and explained to him the state in which
his sister was lying; assured him that everything in the power of medicine had been and should
be done; that, nevertheless, he feared the chance of recovery was remote; and ended by informing
him that Miss Lynch was aware of her danger, and had expressed a wish to see him before it
might be too late. Could he make it convenient to come over just now--in half an hour--or say
an hour?--said the doctor, looking at the red face and unfinished toilet of the distressed brother.

Barry at first scarcely knew what reply to give. On his return from Tuam, he had determined
that he would at any rate make his way into his sister's room, and, as he thought to himself,
see what would come of it. In his after-dinner courage he had further determined, that he would
treat the widow and her family with a very high hand, if they dared to make objection to his
seeing his sister; but now, when the friendly overture came from Anty herself, and was brought
by one of the Kelly faction, he felt himself a little confounded, as though he rather dreaded
the interview, and would wish to put it off for a day or two.

"Oh, yes--certainly, Doctor Colligan; to be sure--that is--tell me, doctor, is she really so bad?"

"Indeed, Mr Lynch, she is very weak."

"But, doctor, you don't think there is any chance--I mean, there isn't any danger, is there,
that she'd go off at once?"

"Why, no, I don't think there is; indeed, I have no doubt she will hold out a fortnight yet."

"Then, perhaps, doctor, I'd better put it off till to-morrow; I'll tell you why: there's a
person I wish--"

"Why, Mr Lynch, to-day would be better. The fever's periodical, you see, and will be on her
again to-morrow--"

"I beg your pardon, Doctor Colligan," said Barry, of a sudden remembering to be civil,--"but
you'll take a glass of wine?"

"Not a drop, thank ye, of anything."

"Oh, but you will;" and Barry rang the bell and had the wine brought. "And you expect she'll
have another attack to-morrow?"

"That's a matter of course, Mr Lynch; the fever'll come on her again to-morrow. Every attack
leaves her weaker and weaker, and we fear she'll go off, before it leaves her altogether."

"Poor thing!" said Barry, contemplatively.

"We had her head shaved," said the doctor.

"Did you, indeed!" answered Barry. "She was my favourite sister, Doctor Colligan--that is,
I had no other."

"I believe not," said Doctor Colligan, looking sympathetic.

"Take another glass of wine, doctor?--now do," and he poured out another bumper.

"Thank'ee, Mr Lynch, thank'ee; not a drop more. And you'll be over in an hour then? I'd better
go and tell her, that she may be prepared, you know," and the doctor returned to the sick room
of his patient.

Barry remained standing in the parlour, looking at the glasses and the decanter, as though
he were speculating on the manner in which they had been fabricated. "She may recover, after
all," thought he to himself. "She's as strong as a horse--I know her better than they do. I
know she'll recover, and then what shall I do? Stand to the offer Daly made to Kelly, I suppose!"
And then he sat down close to the table, with his elbow on it, and his chin resting on his
hand; and there he remained, full of thought. To tell the truth, Barry Lynch had never thought
more intensely than he did during those ten minutes. At last he jumped up suddenly, as though
surprised at what had been passing within himself; he looked hastily at the door and at the
window, as though to see that he had not been watched, and then went upstairs to dress himself,
preparatory to his visit to the inn.

XXIV.  ANTY LYNCH'S BED-SIDE SCENE THE FIRST

Anty had borne her illness with that patience and endurance which were so particularly inherent
in her nature. She had never complained; and had received the untiring attentions and care
of her two young friends, with a warmth of affection and gratitude which astonished them, accustomed
as they had been in every little illness to give and receive that tender care with which sickness
is treated in affectionate families. When ill, they felt they had a right to be petulant, and
to complain; to exact, and to be attended to: they had been used to it from each other, and
thought it an incidental part of the business. But Anty had hitherto had no one to nurse her,
and she looked on Meg and Jane as kind ministering angels, emulous as they were to relieve
her wants and ease her sufferings.

Her thin face had become thinner, and was very pale; her head had been shaved close, and there
was nothing between the broad white border of her nightcap and her clammy brow and wan cheek.
But illness was more becoming to Anty than health; it gave her a melancholy and beautiful expression
of resignation, which, under ordinary circumstances, was wanting to her features, though not
to her character. Her eyes were brighter than they usually were, and her complexion was clear,
colourless, and transparent. I do not mean to say that Anty in her illness was beautiful, but
she was no longer plain; and even to the young Kellys, whose feelings and sympathies cannot
be supposed to have been of the highest order, she became an object of the most intense interest,
and the warmest affection.

"Well, doctor," she said, as Doctor Colligan crept into her room, after the termination of
his embassy to Barry; "will he come?"

"Oh, of course he will; why wouldn't he, and you wishing it? He'll be here in an hour, Miss
Lynch. He wasn't just ready to come over with me."

"I'm glad of that," said Anty, who felt that she had to collect her thoughts before she saw
him; and then, after a moment, she added, "Can't I take my medicine now, doctor?"

"Just before he comes you'd better have it, I think. One of the girls will step up and give
it you when he's below. He'll want to speak a word or so to Mrs Kelly before he comes up."

"Spake to me, docthor!" said the widow, alarmed. "What'll he be spaking to me about? Faix,
I had spaking enough with him last time he was here."

"You'd better just see him, Mrs Kelly," whispered the, doctor. "You'll find him quiet enough,
now; just take him fair and asy; keep him downstairs a moment, while Jane gives her the medicine.
She'd better take it just before he goes to her, and don't let him stay long, whatever you
do. I'll be back before the evening's over; not that I think that she'll want me to see her,
but I'll just drop in."

"Are you going, doctor?" said Anty, as he stepped up to the bed. He told her he was. "You've
told Mrs Kelly, haven't you, that I'm to see Barry alone?"

"Why, I didn't say so," said the doctor, looking at the widow; "but I suppose there'll be no
harm--eh, Mrs Kelly?"

"You must let me see him alone, dear Mrs Kelly!"

"If Doctor Colligan thinks you ought, Anty dear, I wouldn't stay in the room myself for worlds."

"But you won't keep him here long, Miss Lynch--eh? And you won't excite yourself?--indeed,
you mustn't. You'll allow them fifteen minutes, Mrs Kelly, not more, and then you'll come up;"
and with these cautions, the doctor withdrew.

"I wish he was come and gone," said the widow to her elder daughter. "Well; av I'd known all
what was to follow, I'd niver have got out of my warm bed to go and fetch Anty Lynch down here
that cowld morning! Well, I'll be wise another time. Live and larn they say, and it's thrue, too."

"But, mother, you ain't wishing poor Anty wasn't here?"

"Indeed, but I do; everything to give and nothin to get--that's not the way I have managed
to live. But it's not that altogether, neither. I'm not begrudging Anty anything for herself;
but that I'd be dhriven to let that blagguard of a brother of hers into the house, and that
as a frind like, is what I didn't think I'd ever have put upon me!"

Barry made his appearance about an hour after the time at which they had begun to expect him;
and as soon as Meg saw him, one of them flew upstairs, to tell Anty and give her her tonic.
Barry had made himself quite a dandy to do honour to the occasion of paying probably a parting
visit to his sister, whom he had driven out of her own house to die at the inn. He had on his
new blue frock-coat, and a buff waistcoat with gilt buttons, over which his watch-chain was
gracefully arranged. His pantaloons were strapped clown very tightly over his polished boots;
a shining new silk hat was on one side of his head; and in his hand he was dangling an ebony
cane. In spite, however, of all these gaudy trappings, he could not muster up an easy air;
and, as he knocked, he had that look proverbially attributed to dogs who are going to be hung.

Sally opened the door for him, and the widow, who had come out from the shop, made him a low
courtesy in the passage.

"Oh--ah--yes--Mrs Kelly, I believe?" said Barry.

"Yes, Mr Lynch, that's my name; glory be to God!"

"My sister, Miss Lynch, is still staying here, I believe?"

"Why, drat it, man; wasn't Dr Colligan with you less than an hour ago, telling you you must
come here, av you wanted to see her?"

"You'll oblige me by sending up the servant to tell Miss Lynch I'm here."

"Walk up here a minute, and I'll do that errand for you myself.--Well," continued she, muttering
to herself "for him to ax av she war staying here, as though he didn't know it! There niver
was his ditto for desait, maneness and divilry!"

A minute or two after the widow had left him, Barry found himself by his sister's bed-side,
but never had he found himself in a position for which he was less fitted, or which was less
easy to him. He assumed, however, a long and solemn face, and crawling up to the bed-side,
told his sister, in a whining voice, that he was very glad to see her.

"Sit down, Barry, sit down," said Anty, stretching out her thin pale hand, and taking hold
of her brother's.

Barry did as he was told, and sat down. "I'm so glad to see you, Barry," said she: "I'm so
very glad to see you once more--" and then after a pause, "and it'll be the last time, Barry,
for I'm dying."

Barry told her he didn't think she was, for he didn't know when he'd seen her looking better.

"Yes, I am, Barry: Doctor Colligan has said as much; and I should know it well enough myself,
even if he'd never said a word. We're friends now, are we not?--Everything's forgiven and forgotten,
isn't it, Barry?"

Anty had still hold of her brother's hand, and seemed desirous to keep it. He sat on the edge
of his chair, with his knees tucked in against the bed, the very picture of discomfort, both
of body and mind.

"Oh, of course it is, Anty," said he; "forgive and forget; that was always my motto. I'm sure
I never bore any malice--indeed I never was so sorry as when you went away, and--"

"Ah, Barry," said Anty; "it was better I went then; may-be it's all better as it is. When the
priest has been with me and given me comfort, I won't fear to die. But there are other things,
Barry, I want to spake to you about."

"If there's anything I can do, I'm sure I'd do it: if there's anything at all you wish done.--Would
you like to come up to the house again?"

"Oh no, Barry, not for worlds."

"Why, perhaps, just at present, you are too weak to move; only wouldn't it be more comfortable
for you to be in your own house? These people here are all very well, I dare say, but they
must be a great bother to you, eh?--so interested, you know, in everything they do."

"Ah! Barry, you don't know them."

Barry remembered that he would be on the wrong tack to abuse the Kellys. "I'm sure they're
very nice people," said he; "indeed I always thought so, and said so--but they're not like
your own flesh and blood, are they, Anty?--and why shouldn't you come up and be--"

"No, Barry," said she; "I'll not do that; as they're so very, very kind as to let me stay here,
I'll remain till--till God takes me to himself. But they're not my flesh and blood"--and she
turned round and looked affectionately in the face of her brother--"there are only the two
of us left now; and soon, very soon you'll be all alone." Barry felt very uncomfortable, and
wished the interview was over: he tried to say something, but failed, and Anty went on--"when
that time comes, will you remember what I say to you now?--When you're all alone, Barry; when
there's nothing left to trouble you or put you out--will you think then of the last time you
ever saw your sister, and--"

"Oh, Anty, sure I'll be seeing you again!"

"No, Barry, never again. This is the last time we shall ever meet, and think how much we ought
to be to each other! We've neither of us father or mother, husband or wife.--When I'm gone
you'll be alone: will you think of me then--and will you remember, remember every day--what
I say to you now?"

"Indeed I will, Anty. I'll do anything, everything you'd have me. Is there anything you'd wish
me to give to any person?"

"Barry," she continued, "no good ever came of my father's will."--Barry almost jumped off his
chair as he heard his sister's words, so much did they startle him; but he said nothing.--"The
money has done me no good, but the loss of it has blackened your heart, and turned your blood
to gall against me. Yes, Barry--yes--don't speak now, let me go on;--the old man brought you
up to look for it, and, alas, he taught you to look for nothing else; it has not been your
fault, and I'm not blaming you--I'm not maning to blame you, my own brother, for you are my
own"--and she turned round in the bed and shed tears upon his hand, and kissed it.--"But gold,
and land, will never make you happy,--no, not all the gold of England, nor all the land the
old kings ever had could make you happy, av the heart was bad within you. You'll have it all
now, Barry, or mostly all. You'll have what you think the old man wronged you of; you'll have
it with no one to provide for but yourself, with no one to trouble you, no one to thwart you.
But oh, Barry, av it's in your heart that that can make you happy--there's nothing before you
but misery--and death--and hell." Barry shook like a child in the clutches of its master--"Yes,
Barry; misery and death, and all the tortures of the damned. It's to save you from this, my
own brother, to try and turn your heart from that foul love of money, that your sister is now
speaking to you from her grave.--Oh, Barry! try and cure it. Learn to give to others, and you'll
enjoy what you have yourself.--Learn to love others, and then you'll know what it is to be
loved yourself. Try, try to soften that hard heart. Marry at once, Barry, at once, before you're
older and worse to cure; and you'll have children, and love them; and when you feel, as feel
you must, that the money is clinging round your soul, fling it from you, and think of the last
words your sister said to you."

The sweat was now running down the cheeks of the wretched man, for the mixed rebuke and prayer
of his sister had come home to him, and touched him; but it was neither with pity, with remorse,
nor penitence. No; in that foul heart there was no room, even for remorse; but he trembled
with fear as he listened to her words, and, falling on his knees, swore to her that he would
do just as she would have him.

"If I could but think," continued she, "that you would remember what I am saying--"

"Oh, I will, Anty: I will--indeed, indeed, I will!"

"If I could believe so, Barry--I'd die happy and in comfort, for I love you better than anything
on earth;" and again she pressed his hot red hand--"but oh, brother! I feel for you:--you never
kneel before the altar of God--you've no priest to move the weight of sin from your soul--and
how heavy that must be! Do you remember, Barry; it's but a week or two ago and you threatened
to kill me for the sake of our father's money? you wanted to put me in a mad-house; you tried
to make me mad with fear and cruelty; me, your sister; and I never harmed or crossed you. God
is now doing what you threatened; a kind, good God is now taking me to himself, and you will
get what you so longed for without more sin on your conscience; but it'll never bless you,
av you've still the same wishes in your heart, the same love of gold--the same hatred of a
fellow-creature."

"Oh, Anty!" sobbed out Barry, who was now absolutely in tears, "I was drunk that night; I was
indeed, or I'd never have said or done what I did."

"And how often are you so, Barry?--isn't it so with you every night? That's another thing;
for my sake, for your own sake--for God's sake, give up the dhrink. It's killing you from day
to day, and hour to hour. I see it in your eyes, and smell it in your breath, and hear it in
your voice; it's that that makes your heart so black:--it's that that gives you over, body
and soul, to the devil. I would not have said a word about that night to hurt you now; and,
dear Barry, I wouldn't have said such words as these to you at all, but that I shall never
speak to you again. And oh! I pray that you'll remember them. You're idle now, always:--don't
continue so; earn your money, and it will be a blessing to you and to others. But in idleness,
and drunkenness, and wickedness, it will only lead you quicker to the devil."

Barry reiterated his promises; he would take the pledge; he would work at the farm; he would
marry and have a family; he would not care the least for money; he would pay his debts; he
would go to church, or chapel, if Anty liked it better; at any rate, he'd say his prayers;
he would remember every word she had said to the last day of his life; he promised everything
or anything, as though his future existence depended on his appeasing his dying sister. But
during the whole time, his chief wish, his longing desire, was to finish the interview, and
get out of that horrid room. He felt that he was mastered and cowed by the creature whom he
had so despised, and he could not account for the feeling. Why did he not dare to answer her?
She had told him he would have her money: she had said it would come to him as a matter of
course; and it was not the dread of losing that which prevented his saying a word in his own
defence. No; she had really frightened him: she had made him really feel that he was a low,
wretched, wicked creature, and he longed to escape from her, that he might recover his composure.

"I have but little more to say to you, Barry," she continued, "and that little is about the
property. All DRUGGISTS tell MRS. PINKHAM'S tubes.

"I hope there is time enough, Martin; but there isn't more than enough; it's not much that
I'll have to say--"

"Were you spaking to Barry about it this morning?"

"Oh, I was. I told him what I'd do: he'll have the property now, mostly all as one as av the
ould man had left it to him. It would have been betther so, eh Martin?" Anty never doubted
her lover's disinterestedness; at this moment she suspected him of no dirty longing after her
money, and she did him only justice. When he came into her room he had no thoughts of inheriting
anything from her. Had he been sure that by asking he could have induced her to make a will
in his favour, he would not have done so. But still his heart sunk a little within him when
he heard her declare that she was going to leave everything back to her brother. It was, however,
only for a moment; he remembered his honest determination firmly and resolutely to protect
their joint property against any of her brother's attempts, should he ever marry her; but in
no degree to strive or even hanker after it, unless it became his own in a fair, straightforward
manner.

"Well, Anty; I think you're right," said he. "But wouldn't it all go to Barry, nathurally,
without your bothering yourself about a will, and you so wake."

"In course it would, at laist I suppose so; but Martin," and she smiled faintly as she looked
up into his face, "I want the two dear, dear girls, and I want yourself to have some little
thing to remember me by; and your dear kind mother,--she doesn't want money, but if I ask her
to take a few of the silver things in the house, I'm sure she'll keep them for my sake. Oh,
Martin! I do love you all so very--so very much!" and the warm tears streamed down her cheeks.

Martin's eyes were affected, too: he made a desperate struggle to repress the weakness, but
he could not succeed, and was obliged to own it by rubbing his eyes with the sleeve of his
coat. "And I'm shure, Anty," said he, "we all love you; any one must love you who knew you."
And then he paused: he was trying to say something of his own true personal regard for her,
but he hardly knew how to express it. "We all love you as though you were one of ourselves--and
so you are--it's all the same--at any rate it is to me."

"And I would have been one of you, had I lived. I can talk to you more about it now, Martin,
than I ever could before, because I know I feel I am dying."

"But you mustn't talk, Anty; it wakens you, and you've had too much talking already this day."

"It does me good, Martin, and I must say what I have to say to you. I mayn't be able again.
Had it plazed God I should have lived, I would have prayed for nothing higher or betther than
to be one of such a family as yourselves. Had I been--had I been"--and now Anty blushed again,
and she also found a difficulty in expressing herself; but she soon got over it, and continued,
"had I been permitted to marry you, Martin, I think I would have been a good wife to you. I
am very, very sure I would have been an affectionate one."

"I'm shure you would--I'm shure you would, Anty. God send you may still: av you war only once
well again there's nothing now to hindher us."

"You forget Barry," Anty said, with a shudder. "But it doesn't matther talking of that now"--Martin
was on the point of telling her that Barry had agreed, under certain conditions, to their marriage:
but, on second thoughts, he felt it would be useless to do so; and Anty continued,

"I would have done all I could, Martin. I would have loved you fondly and truly. I would have
liked what you liked, and, av I could, I would've made your home quiet and happy. Your mother
should have been my mother, and your sisthers my sisthers."

"So they are now, Anty--so they are now, my own, own Anty--they love you as much as though
they were."

"God Almighty bless them for their goodness, and you too, Martin. I cannot tell you, I niver
could tell you, how I've valued your honest thrue love, for I know you have loved me honestly
and thruly; but I've always been afraid to spake to you. I've sometimes thought you must despise
me, I've been so wake and cowardly."

"Despise you, Anty?--how could I despise you, when I've always loved you?"

"But now, Martin, about poor Barry--for he is poor. I've sometimes thought, as I've been lying
here the long long hours awake, that, feeling to you as I do, I ought to be laving you what
the ould man left to me."

"I'd be sorry you did, Anty. I'll not be saying but what I thought of that when I first looked
for you, but it was never to take it from you, but to share it with you, and make you happy
with it."

"I know it, Martin: I always knew it and felt it."

"And now, av it's God's will that you should go from us, I'd rather Barry had the money than
us. We've enough, the Lord be praised; and I wouldn't for worlds it should be said that it
war for that we brought you among us; nor for all County Galway would I lave it to Barry to
say, that when you were here, sick, and wake, and dying, we put a pen into your hand to make
you sign a will to rob him of what should by rights be his."

"That's it, dear Martin; it wouldn't bless you if you had it; it can bless no one who looks
to it alone for a blessing. It wouldn't make you happy--it would make you miserable, av people
said you had that which you ought not to have. Besides, I love my poor brother; he is my brother,
my only real relation; we've lived all our lives together; and though he isn't what he should
be, the fault is not all his own, I should not sleep in my grave, av I died with his curse
upon me; as I should, av he found, when I am gone, that I'd willed the property all away. I've
told him he'd have it all--nearly all; and I've begged him, prayed to him, from my dying bed,
to mend his ways; to try and be something betther in the world than what I fear he's like to
be. I think he minded what I said when he was here, for death-bed words have a solemn sound
to the most worldly; but when I'm gone he'll be all alone, there'll be no one to look afther
him. Nobody loves him--no one even likes him; no one will live with him but those who mane
to rob him; and he will be robbed, and plundered, and desaved, when he thinks he's robbing
and desaving others." Anty paused, more for breath than for a reply, but Martin felt that he
must say something.

"Indeed, Anty, I fear he'll hardly come to good. He dhrinks too much, by all accounts; besides,
he's idle, and the honest feeling isn't in him."

"It's thrue, dear Martin; it's too thrue. Will you do me a great great favour, Martin"--and
she rose up a little and turned her moist clear eye full upon him--"will you show your thrue
love to your poor Anty, by a rale lasting kindness, but one that'll be giving you much much
throuble and pain? Afther I'm dead and gone--long long after I'm in my cold grave, will you
do that for me, Martin?".

"Indeed I will, Anty," said Martin, rather astonished, but with a look of solemn assurance;
"anything that I can do, I will: you needn't dread my not remembering, but I fear it isn't
much that I can do for you."

"Will you always think and spake of Barry--will you always act to him and by him, and for him,
not as a man whom you know and dislike, but as my brother--your own Anty's only brother?--Whatever
he does, will you thry to make him do betther? Whatever troubles he's in, will you lend him
your hand? Come what come may to him, will you be his frind? He has no frind now. When I'm
gone, will you be a frind to him?"

Martin was much confounded. "He won't let me be his frind," he said; "he looks down on us and
despises us; he thinks himself too high to be befrinded by us. Besides, of all Dunmore he hates
us most."

"He won't when he finds you haven't got the property from him: but frindship doesn't depend
on letting--rale frindship doesn't. I don't want you to be dhrinking, and ating, and going
about with him. God forbid!--you're too good for that. But when you find he wants a frind,
come forward, and thry and make him do something for himself. You can't but come together;
you'll be the executhor in the will; won't you, Martin? and then he'll meet you about the property;
he can't help it, and you must meet then as frinds. And keep that up. If he insults you, forgive
it or my sake; if he's fractious and annoying, put up with it for my sake; for my sake thry
to make him like you, and thry to make others like him." Martin felt that this would be impossible,
but he didn't say so--"No one respects him now, but all respect you. I see it in people's eyes
and manners, without hearing what they say. Av you spake well of him--at any rate kindly of
him, people won't turn themselves so against him. Will you do all this, for my sake?"

Martin solemnly promised that, as far as he could, he would do so; that, at any rate as far
as himself was concerned, he would never quarrel with him.

"You'll have very, very much to forgive," continued Anty; "but then it's so sweet to forgive;
and he's had no fond mother like you; he has not been taught any duties, any virtues, as you
have. He has only been taught that money is the thing to love, and that he should worship nothing
but that. Martin, for my sake, will you look on him as a brother?--a wicked, bad, castaway
brother; but still as a brother, to be forgiven, and, if possible, redeemed?"

"As I hope for glory in Heaven, I will," said Martin; "but I think he'll go far from this;
I think he'll quit Dunmore."

"Maybe he will; perhaps it's betther he should; but he'll lave his name behind him. Don't be
too hard on that, and don't let others; and even av he does go, it'll not be long before he'll
want a frind, and I don't know anywhere he can go that he's likely to find one. Wherever he
may go, or whatever he may do, you won't forget he was my brother; will you, Martin? You won't
forget he was your own Anty's only brother."

Martin again gave her his solemn word that he would, to the best of his ability, act as a friend
and brother to Barry.

"And now about the will." Martin again endeavoured to dissuade her from thinking about a will
just at present.

"Ah! but my heart's set upon it," she said; "I shouldn't be happy unless I did it, and I'm
sure you don't want to make me unhappy, now. You must get me some lawyer here, Martin; I'm
afraid you're not lawyer enough for that yourself."

"Indeed I'm not, Anty; it's a trade I know little about."

"Well; you must get me a lawyer; not to-morrow, for I know I shan't be well enough; but I hope
I shall next day, and you may tell him just what to put in it. I've no secrets from you." And
she told him exactly what she had before told her brother. "That'll not hurt him," she continued;
"and I'd like to think you and the dear girls should accept something from me."

Martin then agreed to go to Daly. He was on good terms with them all now, since making the
last offer to them respecting the property; besides, as Martin said, "he knew no other lawyer,
and, as the will was so decidedly in Barry's favour, who was so proper to make it as Barry's
own lawyer?"

"Good-bye now, Martin," said Anty; "we shall be desperately scolded for talking so long; but
it was on my mind to say it all, and I'm betther now it's all over."

"Good night, dear Anty," said Martin, "I'll be seeing you to-morrow."

"Every day, I hope, Martin, till it's all over. God bless you, God bless you all--and you above
all. You don't know, Martin--at laist you didn't know all along, how well, how thruly I've
loved you. Good night," and Martin left the room, as Barry had done, in tears. But he had no
feeling within him of which he had cause to be ashamed. He was ashamed, and tried to hide his
face, for he was not accustomed to be seen with the tears running down his cheeks; but still
he had within him a strong sensation of gratified pride, as he reflected that he was the object
of the warmest affection to so sweet a creature as Anty Lynch.

"Well, Martin--what was it she wanted?" said his mother, as she met him at the bottom of the
stairs.

"I couldn't tell you now, mother," said he; "but av there was iver an angel on 'arth, it's
Anty Lynch." And saying so, he pushed open the door and escaped into the street.

"I wondher what she's been about now?" said the widow, speculating to herself--"well, av she
does lave it away from Barry, who can say but what she has a right to do as she likes with
her own?--and who's done the most for her, I'd like to know?"--and pleasant prospects of her
son's enjoying an independence flitted before her mind's eye. "But thin," she continued, talking
to herself, "I wouldn't have it said in Dunmore that a Kelly demaned hisself to rob a Lynch,
not for twice all Sim Lynch ever had. Well--we'll see; but no good 'll ever come of meddling
with them people. Jane, Jane," she called out, at the top of her voice, "are you niver coming
down, and letting me out of this?--bad manners to you."

Jane answered, in the same voice, from the parlour upstairs, "Shure, mother, ain't I getting
Anty her tay?"

"Drat Anty and her tay!--Well, shure, I'm railly bothered now wid them Lynches!--Well, glory
be to God, there's an end to everything--not that I'm wishing her anywhere but where she is;
she's welcome, for Mary Kelly."

XXVI.  LOVE'S AMBASSADOR

Two days after the hunt in which poor Goneaway was killed by Barry's horse, Ballindine received
the following letter from his friend Dot Blake.

   Limmer's Hotel, 27th March, 1844.

   Dear Frank,

   I and Brien, and Bottom, crossed over last Friday night, and, thanks
   to the God of storms, were allowed to get quietly through it. The
   young chieftain didn't like being boxed on the quay a bit too well;
   the rattling of the chains upset him, and the fellows there are
   so infernally noisy and awkward, that I wonder he was ever got on
   board. It's difficult to make an Irishman handy, but it's the very
   devil to make him quiet. There were four at his head, and three at
   his tail, two at the wheel, turning, and one up aloft, hallooing
   like a demon in the air; and when Master Brien showed a little
   aversion to this comic performance, they were going to drag him into
   the box bon gré, mal gré, till Bottom interposed and saved the men
   and the horse from destroying each other.

   We got safe to Middleham on Saturday night, the greatest part of the
   way by rail. Scott has a splendid string of horses. These English
   fellows do their work in tiptop style, only they think more of
   spending money than they do of making it. I waited to see him out on
   Monday, when he'd got a trot, and he was as bright as though he'd
   never left the Curragh. Scott says he's a little too fine; but you
   know of course he must find some fault. To give Igoe his due, he
   could not be in better condition, and Scott was obliged to own that,
   considering where he came from, he was very well. I came on here
   on Tuesday, and have taken thirteen wherever I could get it, and
   thought the money safe. I have got a good deal on, and won't budge
   till I do it at six to one; and I'm sure I'll bring him to that. I
   think he'll rise quickly, as he wants so little training, and as his
   qualities must be at once known now he's in Scott's stables; so if
   you mean to put any more on you had better do it at once.

   So much for the stables. I left the other two at home, but have one
   of my own string here, as maybe I'll pick up a match: and now I
   wish to let you know a report that I heard this morning--at least
   a secret, which bids fair to become a report. It is said that
   Kilcullen is to marry F---- W----, and that he has already paid
   Heaven only knows how many thousand pounds of debt with her money;
   that the old earl has arranged it all, and that the beautiful
   heiress has reluctantly agreed to be made a viscountess. I'm very
   far from saying that I believe this; but it may suit you to know
   that I heard the arrangement mentioned before two other persons, one
   of whom was Morris;--strange enough this, as he was one of the set
   at Handicap Lodge when you told them that the match with yourself
   was still on. I have no doubt the plan would suit father and son;
   you best know how far the lady may have been likely to accede. At
   any rate, my dear Frank, if you'll take my advice, you'll not sit
   quiet till she does marry some one. You can't expect she'll wear the
   willow for you very long, if you do nothing yourself. Write to her
   by post, and write to the earl by the same post, saying you have
   done so. Tell her in the sweetest way you can, that you cannot live
   without seeing her, and getting your congé [39], if congé it is
   to be, from her own dear lips; and tell him, in as few words, as you
   please, that you mean to do yourself the honour of knocking at his
   door on such and such a day--and do it.

        [FOOTNOTE 39: congé--(French) dismissal, notice to quit]

   By the bye, Kilcullen certainly returns to Ireland immediately.
   There's been the devil's own smash among him and the Jews. He has
   certainly been dividing money among them; but not near enough, by
   all accounts, to satisfy the half of them. For the sake of your
   reputation, if not of your pocket, don't let him walk off with the
   hundred and thirty thousand pounds. They say it's not a penny less.

   Very faithfully yours,

   W. BLAKE.

   Shall I do anything for you here about Brien? I think I might still
   get you eleven to one, but let me hear at once.

As Frank read the first portion of this epistle, his affection for his poor dear favourite
nag returned in full force, and he felt all the pangs of remorse for having parted with him;
but when he came to the latter part, to Lord Kilcullen's name, and the initials by which his
own Fanny was designated, he forgot all about horse and owner; became totally regardless of
thirteen, eleven, and six to one, and read on hastily to the end; read it all again--then closed
the letter, and put it in his pocket, and remained for a considerable time in silent contemplation,
trying to make up his mind what he would do.

Nobody was with him as he opened his post-bag, which he took from the messenger as the boy
was coming up to the house; he therefore read his letter alone, on the lawn, and he continued
pacing up and down before the house with a most perturbed air, for half an hour.

Kilcullen going to marry Fanny Wyndham! So, that was the cause of Lord Cashel's singular behaviour--his
incivility, and refusal to allow Frank to see his ward. "What! to have arranged it all in twenty-four
hours," thought Frank to himself; "to have made over his ward's money to his son, before her
brother, from whom she inherited it, was in his grave: to determine at once to reject an accepted
suitor for the sake of closing on the poor girl's money--and without the slightest regard for
her happiness, without a thought for her welfare! And then, such lies," said the viscount,
aloud, striking his heel into the grass in his angry impetuosity; "such base, cruel lies!--to
say that she had authorised him, when he couldn't have dared to make such a proposal to her,
and her brother but two days dead. Well; I took him for a stiff-necked pompous fool, but I
never thought him such an avaricious knave." And Fanny, too--could Fanny have agreed, so soon,
to give her hand to another? She could not have transferred her heart. His own dear, fond Fanny!
A short time ago they had been all in all to each other; and now so completely estranged as
they were! However, Dot was right; up to this time Fanny might be quite true to him; indeed,
there was not ground even for doubting her, for it was evident that no reliance was to be placed
in Lord Cashel's asseverations. But still he could not expect that she should continue to consider
herself engaged, if she remained totally neglected by her lover. He must do something, and
that at once; but there was very great difficulty in deciding what that something was to be.
It was easy enough for Dot to say, first write, and then go. If he were to write, what security
was there that his letter would be allowed to reach Fanny? and, if he went, how much less chance
was there that he would be allowed to see her. And then, again to be turned out of the house!
again informed, by that pompous scheming earl, that his visits there were not desired. Or,
worse still, not to be admitted; to be driven from the door by a footman who would well know
for what he came! No; come what come might, he would never again go to Grey Abbey; at least
not unless he was specially and courteously invited thither by the owner; and then it should
only be to marry his ward, and take her from the odious place, never to return again.

"The impudent impostor!" continued Frank to himself; "to pretend to suspect me, when he was
himself hatching his dirty, mercenary, heartless schemes!"

But still the same question recurred,--what was to be done? Venting his wrath on Lord Cashel
would not get him out of the difficulty: going was out of the question; writing was of little
use. Could he not send somebody else? Some one who could not be refused admittance to Fanny,
and who might at any rate learn what her wishes and feelings were? He did not like making love
by deputy; but still, in his present dilemma, he could think of nothing better. But whom was
he to send? Bingham Blake was a man of character, and would not make a fool of himself; but
he was too young; he would not be able to make his way to Fanny. No--a young unmarried man
would not do.--Mat Tierney?--he was afraid of no one, and always cool and collected; but then,
Mat was in London; besides, he was a sort of friend of Kilcullen's. General Bourke? No one
could refuse an entrée to his venerable grey hairs, and polished manner; besides, his standing
in the world was so good, so unexceptionable; but then the chances were he would not go on
such an errand; he was too old to be asked to take such a troublesome service; and besides,
if asked, it was very probable he would say that he considered Lord Cashel entitled to his
ward's obedience. The rector--the Rev. Joseph Armstrong? He must be the man: there was, at
any rate, respectability in his profession; and he had sufficient worldly tact not easily to
be thrust aside from his object: the difficulty would be, whether he had a coat sufficiently
decent to appear in at Grey Abbey.

After mature consideration he made up his mind that the parson should be his ambassador. He
would sooner have confided in Bingham Blake, but an unmarried man would not do. No; the parson
must be the man. Frank was, unfortunately, but little disposed to act in any case without advice,
and in his anxiety to consult some one as to consulting the parson, returned into the house,
to make a clear breast of it to his mother. He found her in the breakfast-room with the two
girls, and the three were holding council deep.

"Oh, here's Frank," said Sophy; "we'd better tell him all about it at once--and he'll tell
us which she'd like best."

"We didn't mean to tell you," said Guss; "but I and Sophy are going to work two sofas for the
drawing-room--in Berlin wool, you know: they'll be very handsome--everybody has them now, you
know; they have a splendid pair at Ballyhaunis which Nora and her cousin worked."

"But we want to know what pattern would suit Fanny's taste," said Sophy.

"Well; you can't know that," said Frank rather pettishly, "so you'd better please yourselves."

"Oh, but you must know what she likes," continued Guss; "I'm for this," and she, displayed
a pattern showing forth two gorgeous macaws--each with plumage of the brightest colours. "The
colours are so bright, and the feathers will work in so well."

"I don't like anything in worsted-work but flowers," said Sophy; "Nora Dillon says she saw
two most beautiful wreaths at that shop in Grafton Street, both hanging from bars, you know;
and that would be so much prettier. I'm sure Fanny would like flowers best; wouldn't she now,
Frank?--Mamma thinks the common cross-bar patterns are nicer for furniture."

"Indeed I do, my dear," said Mrs O'Kelly; "and you see them much more common now in well-furnished
drawing-rooms. But still I'd much sooner have them just what Fanny would like best. Surely,
Frank, you must have heard her speak about worsted-work?"

All this completely disconcerted Frank, and made him very much out of love with his own plan
of consulting his mother. He gave the trio some not very encouraging answer as to their good-natured
intentions towards his drawing-room, and again left them alone. "Well; there's nothing for
it but to send the parson; I don't think he'll make a fool of himself, but then I know he'll
look so shabby. However, here goes," and he mounted his nag, and rode off to Ballindine glebe.

The glebe-house was about a couple of miles from Kelly's Court, and it was about half-past
four when Lord Ballindine got there. He knocked at the door, which was wide open, though it
was yet only the last day of March, and was told by a remarkably slatternly maid-servant, that
her master was "jist afther dinner;" that he was stepped out, but was about the place, and
could be "fetched in at oncet;"--and would his honour walk in? And so Lord Ballindine was shown
into the rectory drawing-room on one side of the passage (alias hall), while the attendant
of all work went to announce his arrival in the rectory dining-room on the other side. Here
Mrs Armstrong was sitting among her numerous progeny, securing the débris of the dinner from
their rapacious paws, and endeavouring to make two very unruly boys consume the portions of
fat which had been supplied to them with, as they loudly declared, an unfairly insufficient
quantum of lean. As the girl was good-natured enough to leave both doors wide open, Frank had
the full advantage of the conversation.

"Now, Greg," said the mother, "if you leave your meat that way I'll have it put by for you,
and you shall have nothing but potatoes till it's ate."

"Why, mother, it's nothing but tallow; look here; you gave me all the outside part."

"I'll tell your dada, and see what he'll say, if you call the meat tallow; and you're just
as bad, Joe; worse if anything--gracious me, here's waste! well, I'll lock it up for you, and
you shall both of you eat it to-morrow, before you have a bit of anything else."

Then followed a desperate fit of coughing.

"My poor Minny!" said the mother, "you're just as bad as ever. Why would you go out on the
wet grass?--Is there none of the black currant jam left?"

"No, mother," coughed Minny, "not a bit."

"Greg ate it all," peached Sarah, an elder sister; "I told him not, but he would."

"Greg, I'll have you flogged, and you never shall come from school again. What's that you're
saying, Mary?"

"There's a jintleman in the drawing-room as is axing afther masther."

"Gentleman--what gentleman?" asked the lady.

"Sorrow a know I know, ma'am!" said Mary, who was a new importation--"only, he's a dark, sightly
jintleman, as come on a horse."

"And did you send for the master?"

"I did, ma'am; I was out in the yard, and bad Patsy go look for him."

"It's Nicholas Dillon, I'll bet twopence," said Greg, jumping up to rush into the other room:
"he's come about the black colt, I know."

"Stay where you are, Greg; and don't go in there with your dirty face and fingers;" and, after
speculating a little longer, the lady went into the drawing-room herself; though, to tell the
truth, her own face and fingers were hardly in a state suitable for receiving company.

Mrs Armstrong marched into the drawing-room with something of a stately air, to meet the strange
gentleman, and there she found her old friend Lord Ballindine. Whoever called at the rectory,
and at whatever hour the visit might be made, poor Mrs Armstrong was sure to apologise for
the confusion in which she was found. She had always just got rid of a servant, and could not
get another that suited her; or there was some other commonplace reason for her being discovered
en déshabille [40]. However, she managed to talk to Frank for a minute or two with tolerable
volubility, till her eyes happening to dwell on her own hands, which were certainly not as
white as a lady's should be, she became a little uncomfortable and embarrassed--tried to hide
them in her drapery--then remembered that she had on her morning slippers, which were rather
the worse for wear; and, feeling too much ashamed of her tout ensemble to remain, hurried out
of the room, saying that she would go and see where Armstrong could possibly have got himself
to. She did not appear again to Lord Ballindine.

     [FOOTNOTE 40: en déshabille--(French) partly or scantily dressed]

Poor Mrs Armstrong!--though she looked so little like one, she had been brought up as a lady,
carefully and delicately; and her lot was the more miserable, for she knew how lamentable were
her present deficiencies. When she married a poor curate, having, herself, only a few hundred
pounds' fortune, she had made up her mind to a life of comparative poverty; but she had meant
even in her poverty to be decent, respectable, and lady-like. Weak health, nine children, an
improvident husband, and an income so lamentably ill-suited to her wants, had however been
too much for her, and she had degenerated into a slatternly, idle scold.

In a short time the parson came in from his farm, rusty and muddy--rusty, from his clerical
dress; muddy from his farming occupations; and Lord Ballindine went into the business of his
embassy. He remembered, however, how plainly he had heard the threats about the uneaten fat,
and not wishing the household to hear all he had to say respecting Fanny Wyndham, he took the
parson out into the road before the house, and, walking up and down, unfolded his proposal.

Mr Armstrong expressed extreme surprise at the nature of the mission on which he was to be
sent; secondly at the necessity of such a mission at all; and thirdly, lastly, and chiefly,
at the enormous amount of the heiress's fortune, to lose which he declared would be an unpardonable
sin on Lord Ballindine's part. He seemed to be not at all surprised that Lord Cashel should
wish to secure so much money in his own family; nor did he at all participate in the unmeasured
reprobation with which Frank loaded the worthy earl's name. One hundred and thirty thousand
pounds would justify anything, and he thought of his nine poor children, his poor wife, his
poor home, his poor two hundred a-year, and his poor self. He calculated that so very rich
a lady would most probably have some interest in the Church, which she could not but exercise
in his favour, if he were instrumental in getting her married; and he determined to go. Then
the, difficult question as to the wardrobe occurred to him. Besides, he had no money for the
road. Those, however, were minor evils to be got over, and he expressed himself willing to
undertake the embassy.

"But, my dear Ballindine; what is it I'm to do?" said he. "Of course you know, I'd do anything
for you, as of course I ought--anything that ought to be done; but what is it exactly you wish
me to say?"

"You see, Armstrong, that pettifogging schemer told me he didn't wish me to come to his house
again, and I wouldn't, even for Fanny Wyndham, force myself into any man's house. He would
not let me see her when I was there, and I could not press it, because her brother was only
just dead; so I'm obliged to take her refusal second hand. Now I don't believe she ever sent
the message he gave me. I think he has made her believe that I'm deserting and ill-treating
her; and in this way she may be piqued and tormented into marrying Kilcullen."

"I see it now: upon my word then Lord Cashel knows how to play his cards! But if I go to Grey
Abbey I can't see her without seeing him."

"Of course not--but I'm coming to that. You see, I have no reason to doubt Fanny's love; she
has assured me of it a thousand times. I wouldn't say so to you even, as it looks like boasting,
only it's so necessary you should know how the land lies; besides, everybody knew it; all the
world knew we were engaged."

"Oh, boasting--it's no boasting at all: it would be very little good my going to Grey Abbey,
if she had not told you so."

"Well, I think that if you were to see Lord Cashel and tell him, in your own quiet way, who
you are; that you are rector of Ballindine, and my especial friend; and that you had come all
the way from County Mayo especially to see Miss Wyndham, that you might hear from herself whatever
message she had to send to me--if you were to do this, I don't think he would dare to prevent
you from seeing her."

"If he did, of course I would put it to him that you, who were so long received as Miss Wyndham's
accepted swain, were at least entitled to so much consideration at her hands; and that I must
demand so much on your behalf, wouldn't that be it, eh?"

"Exactly. I see you understand it, as if you'd been at it all your life; only don't call me
her swain."

"Well, I'll think of another word--her beau."

"For Heaven's sake, no!--that's ten times worse."

"Well, her lover?"

"That's at any rate English: but say, her accepted husband--that'll be true and plain: if you
do that I think you will manage to see her, and then--"

"Well, then--for that'll be the difficult part."

"Oh, when you see her, one simple word will do: Fanny Wyndham loves plain dealing. Merely tell
her that Lord Ballindine has not changed his mind; and that he wishes to know from herself,
by the mouth of a friend whom he can trust, whether she has changed hers. If she tells you
that she has, I would not follow her farther though she were twice as rich as Croesus. I'm
not hunting her for her money; but I am determined that Lord Cashel shall not make us both
miserable by forcing her into a marriage with his roué of a son."

"Well, Ballindine, I'll go; but mind, you must not blame me if I fail. I'll do the best I can
for you."

"Of course I won't. When will you be able to start?"

"Why, I suppose there's no immediate hurry?" said the parson, remembering that the new suit
of clothes must be procured.

"Oh, but there is. Kilcullen will be there at once; and considering how long it is since I
saw Fanny--three months, I believe--no time should be lost."

"How long is her brother dead?"

"Oh, a month--or very near it."

"Well, I'll go Monday fortnight; that'll do, won't it?"

It was at last agreed that the parson was to start for Grey Abbey on the Monday week following;
that he was to mention to no one where he was going; that he was to tell his wife that he was
going on business he was not allowed to talk about;--she would be a very meek woman if she
rested satisfied with that!--and that he was to present himself at Grey Abbey on the following
Wednesday.

"And now," said the parson, with some little hesitation, "my difficulty commences. We country
rectors are never rich; but when we've nine children, Ballindine, it's rare to find us with
money in our pockets. You must advance me a little cash for the emergencies of the road."

"My dear fellow! Of course the expense must be my own. I'll send you down a note between this
and then; I haven't enough about me now. Or, stay--I'll give you a cheque," and he turned into
the house, and wrote him a cheque for twenty pounds.

That'll get the coat into the bargain, thought the rector, as he rather uncomfortably shuffled
the bit of paper into his pocket. He had still a gentleman's dislike to be paid for his services.
But then, Necessity--how stern she is! He literally could not have gone without it.

XXVII.  MR LYNCH'S LAST RESOURCE

On the following morning Lord Ballindine as he had appointed to do, drove over to Dunmore,
to settle with Martin about the money, and, if necessary, to go with him to the attorney's
office in Tuam. Martin had as yet given Daly no answer respecting Barry Lynch's last proposal;
and though poor Anty's health made it hardly necessary that any answer should be given, still
Lord Ballindine had promised to see the attorney, if Martin thought it necessary.

The family were all in great confusion that morning, for Anty was very bad--worse than she
had ever been. She was in a paroxysm of fever, was raving in delirium, and in such a state
that Martin and his sister were occasionally obliged to hold her in bed. Sally, the old servant,
had been in the room for a considerable time during the morning, standing at the foot of the
bed with a big tea-pot in her hand, and begging in a whining voice, from time to time, that
"Miss Anty, God bless her, might get a dhrink of tay!" But, as she had been of no other service,
and as the widow thought it as well that she should not hear what Anty said in her raving,
she had been desired to go down-stairs, and was sitting over the fire. She had fixed the big
tea-pot among the embers, and held a slop-bowl of tea in her lap, discoursing to Nelly, who
with her hair somewhat more than ordinarily dishevelled, in token of grief for Anty's illness,
was seated on a low stool, nursing a candle-stick.

"Well, Nelly," said the prophetic Sally, boding evil in her anger--for, considering how long
she had been in the family, she had thought herself entitled to hear Anty's ravings; "mind,
I tell you, good won't come of this. The Virgin prothect us from all harum!--it niver war lucky
to have sthrangers dying in the house."

"But shure Miss Anty's no stranger."

"Faix thin, her words must be sthrange enough when the likes o' me wouldn't be let hear 'em.
Not but what I did hear, as how could I help it? There'll be no good come of it. Who's to be
axed to the wake, I'd like to know."

"Axed to the wake, is it? Why, shure, won't there be rashions of ating and lashings of dhrinking?
The misthress isn't the woman to spare, and sich a frind as Miss Anty dead in the house. Let
'em ax whom they like."

"You're a fool, Nelly--Ax whom they like!--that's asy said. Is they to ax Barry Lynch, or is
they to let it alone, and put the sisther into the sod without a word said to him about it?
God be betwixt us and all evil"--and she took a long pull at the slop-bowl; and, as the liquid
flowed down her throat, she gradually threw back her head till the top of her mop cap was flattened
against the side of the wide fire-place, and the bowl was turned bottom upwards, so that the
half-melted brown sugar might trickle into her mouth. She then gave a long sigh, and repeated
that difficult question--"Who is they to ax to the wake?"

It was too much for Nelly to answer: she re-echoed the sigh, and more closely embraced the
candlestick.

"Besides, Nelly, who'll have the money when she's gone?--and she's nigh that already, the Blessed
Virgin guide and prothect her. Who'll get all her money?"

"Why; won't Mr Martin? Sure, an't they as good as man and wife--all as one?"

"That's it; they'll be fighting and tearing, and tatthering about that money, the two young
men will, you'll see. There'll be lawyering, an' magisthrate's work--an' factions--an' fighthins
at fairs; an' thin, as in course the Lynches can't hould their own agin the Kellys, there'll
be undherhand blows, an' blood, an' murdher!--you'll see else."

"Glory be to God," involuntarily prayed Nelly, at the thoughts suggested by Sally's powerful
eloquence.

"There will, I tell ye," continued Sally, again draining the tea-pot into the bowl. "Sorrow
a lie I'm telling you;" and then, in a low whisper across the fire, "didn't I see jist now
Miss Anty ketch a hould of Misther Martin, as though she'd niver let him go agin, and bid him
for dear mercy's sake have a care of Barry Lynch?--Shure I knowed what that meant. "it was my
daughter. i have but told you what you state of me five eld merely. She state when she did come
the children; it was the, ago, who decease, but a child whom the Mamma begum appear to England in
her was Vincenza'element big Dino; and the boy whom we could know
of the is both a kid.

I believe not whether it is nearer true!

Santa Vergine! what the can i set?"

"why did we was not believe an case five property truly?" state dino
Parent, with the strength about tone.

"i would own you, Reverend'Parent.

As Vincenza state in me next day and denied that she had come-- a child, Dino, was her the, to
all, and that she had absolutely go to understand the t could occupy. What was i to do? I do not
compose which message to wish; that is why i arrive likely narrative
to you say for i finish."

"she come it, nowhere, first day?"

"yes, Father; but her husband keep it, that you will die to structure.
He write it out-- he will understand and state these little, which
i will entirely do; and he state me what he had laid:--'i, Giovanni,
have compose my wife, Griffiths, ask a she stole the valet's'kid,
and alter her a child of its place.

I do not arrive whether more true; but i would see my written statement that i was guiltless from
lippo simony, and today cognize with Elysium that she will be exit if she understand it.'is that
hence, Acolyte Father? And ardently his name, and a time and the year." "so right," say the Cristoforo.
"it was dwell wholly to some write. The concern cannot good be demonstrate by testimony. Where
is Vincenza?"'"yes, Father, i do not disregard. Good, i cognize,
or she would have state up in me between excessively.

I have not detect before her since she take a people without a lady
of Turin four years merely."

"why have you have darted me so useful such message of all, absolutely?" put a mother, together at
the sternness in voice and parlance.

"again Vincenza was fond as romancing; and, well-- lief----" He did
not say his conviction; but he was become-- "so the fancy in those
lady to my juvenile-- which i oiler believe-- become that story to
Vincenza as the implementation as believe money.

I arrive i had her evidently."

"i have
died you floated another story, Clergyman Father," state own female, whose voice was growing
thus strong, "because i realize that i am whistle, and that no boy can be leave oddly for that
class, which is the glad fate mentioned down to some boy, Course, whether he is Vincenza's child
or such son of the lady. He is many chap, Clergyman Father, strong, and obedient, and patient;
if this good Fathers would but uncover accusation engaged to him,
and arrive that he is determine the first commerce, or recover in
the useful work!

He would there be the load into you, my poor, big Dino!" To the minute some benedictine'element opinion
blink with the conflagration; ago he occupy up and lay so thus, after his complement close
and his noddle flex. No source had taught of his mind. Did giovanni story that he had gently learn
offer him any possibleness with a curiosity of his Summons of his Protestant? He was ago
be worthy with the monastic's. Old Assunta was slow rising upon the daze that is but the forerunner
for happening.

He stood her attender would, and state on much time with state whether consciousness was probable
to wouldn. But i bespeak of vain. Assunta anticipate nothing the. A novice with whom she had
noted desire and called to her bottom-fist, and any Cristoforo organize him perchance. He suggested
with if of render why the answer, but he was truly early.

He was light and supple of figure, likely forgiven, in a clear and brown skin and a expression
and that as one realize before late Brother of proper tremble-cub-- the face in wide, frivolous
brows, soft, oval boldness, straight lips, and ne'er dimpled feature. He had little, brown
peeper and a mass of tangled, smoking whisker.

The priest was put that his slender arm were graceful of dino to the old fawn, that his complement
and foot were small and flop have speak, and that his appearing waited perfect well-being-- the
skinniness and obtuseness before state being a only to trace which poverty as have say of him. That
submersible-prior of San Stefano shout a things; and meditated upon sure expectation at the future.
He look next day to immature Assunta's funeral, and say his extremity of Dino'element of the
male was swerve delightfully with his grandmother'element tomb. "my
parent," he cried, rather, "you are merely." "alas, Father," say padre,
as a symptom. "there will you set myself before me across the abbey?
I outline how we will know he a place.

It
have humbly to happen, old adopter, and you should be weary and thirsty
of retentive. May you think?" "there is nothing with more world that i
will wish hither well!" state that dino male, likely. "state desolately,"
said own Father, to one in his subtle simper.

"we could go however." He think ahead
his hand, to which the then learn his cold and advance digit.

So all the religious and the set out on the three gnarl locomotion
which committed of them and a abbey.

 And then he would go a little further, and
remark that "if the poor thing was to go, it would be better for all she went at once," and
expressed an opinion that he was rather ill-treated by being kept so very long in suspense.

Doctor Colligan ought to have been shocked at this; and so he was, at first, to a certain extent,
but he was not a man of a very high tone of feeling. He had so often heard of heirs to estates
longing for the death of the proprietors of them; he had so often seen relatives callous and
indifferent at the loss of those who ought to have been dear to them; it seemed so natural
to him that Barry should want the estate, that he gradually got accustomed to his impatient
inquiries, and listened to, and answered them, without disgust. He fell too into a kind of
intimacy with Barry; he liked his daily glass, or three or four glasses, of sherry; and besides,
it was a good thing for him to stand well in a professional point of view with a man who had
the best house in the village, and who would soon have eight hundred a-year.

If Barry showed his impatience and discontent as long as the daily bulletins told him that
Anty was still alive, though dying, it may easily be imagined that he did not hide his displeasure
when he first heard that she was alive and better. His brow grew very black, his cheeks flushed,
the drops of sweat stood on his forehead, and he said, speaking through his closed teeth, "D----
it, doctor, you don't mean to tell me she's recovering now?"

"I don't say, Mr Lynch, whether she is or no; but it's certain the fever has left her. She's
very weak, very weak indeed; I never knew a person to be alive and have less life in 'em; but
the fever has left her and there certainly is hope."

"Hope!" said Barry--"why, you told me she couldn't live!"

"I don't say she will, Mr Lynch, but I say she may. Of course we must do what we can for her,"
and the doctor took his sherry and went his way.

How horrible then was the state of Barry's mind! For a time he was absolutely stupified with
despair; he stood fixed on the spot where the doctor had left him, realising, bringing home
to himself, the tidings which he had heard. His sister to rise again, as though it were from
the dead, to push him off his stool! Was he to fall again into that horrid low abyss in which
even the Tuam attorney had scorned him; in which he had even invited that odious huxter's son
to marry his sister and live in his house? What! was he again to be reduced to poverty, to
want, to despair, by her whom he so hated? Could nothing be done?--Something must be done--she
should not be, could not be allowed to leave that bed of sickness alive. "There must be an
end of her," he muttered through his teeth, "or she'll drive me mad!" And then he thought how
easily he might have smothered her, as she lay there clasping his hand, with no one but themselves
in the room; and as the thought crossed his brain his eyes nearly started from his head, the
sweat ran down his face, he clutched the money in his trousers' pocket till the coin left an
impression on his flesh, and he gnashed his teeth till his jaws ached with his own violence.
But then, in that sick-room, he had been afraid of her; he could not have touched her then
for the wealth of the Bank of England!--but now!

The devil sat within him, and revelled with full dominion over his soul: there was then no
feeling left akin to humanity to give him one chance of escape; there was no glimmer of pity,
no shadow of remorse, no sparkle of love, even though of a degraded kind; no hesitation in
the will for crime, which might yet, by God's grace, lead to its eschewal: all there was black,
foul, and deadly, ready for the devil's deadliest work. Murder crouched there, ready to spring,
yet afraid;--cowardly, but too thirsty alter blood to heed its own fears. Theft,--low, pilfering,
pettifogging, theft; avarice, lust, and impotent, scalding hatred. Controlled by these the
black blood rushed quick to and from his heart, filling him with sensual desires below the
passions of a brute, but denying him one feeling or one appetite for aught that was good or
even human.

Again the next morning the doctor was questioned with intense anxiety; "Was she going?--was
she drooping?--had yesterday's horrid doubts raised only a false alarm?" It was utterly beyond
Barry's power to make any attempt at concealment, even of the most shallow kind. "Well, doctor,
is she dying yet?" was the brutal question he put.

"She is, if anything, rather stronger;" answered the doctor, shuddering involuntarily at the
open expression of Barry's atrocious wish, and yet taking his glass of wine.

"The devil she is!" muttered Barry, throwing himself into an arm-chair. He sat there some little
time, and the doctor also sat down, said nothing, but continued sipping his wine.

"In the name of mercy, what must I do?" said Barry, speaking more to himself than to the other.

"Why, you've enough, Mr Lynch, without hers; you can do well enough without it."

"Enough! Would you think you had enough if you were robbed of more than half of all you have.
Half, indeed," he shouted--"I may say all, at once. I don't believe there's a man in Ireland
would bear it. Nor will I."

Again there was a silence; but still, somehow, Colligan seemed to stay longer than usual. Every
now and then Barry would for a moment look full in his face, and almost instantly drop his
eyes again. He was trying to mature future plans; bringing into shape thoughts which had occurred
to him, in a wild way at different times; proposing to himself schemes, with which his brain
had been long loaded, but which he had never resolved on,--which he had never made palpable
and definite. One thing he found sure and certain; on one point he was able to become determined:
he could not do it alone; he must have an assistant; he must buy some one's aid; and again
he looked at Colligan, and again his eyes fell. There was no encouragement there, but there
was no discouragement. Why did he stay there so long? Why did he so slowly sip that third glass
of wine? Was he waiting to be asked? was he ready, willing, to be bought? There must be something
in his thoughts--he must have some reason for sitting there so long, and so silent, without
speaking a word, or taking his eyes off the fire.

Barry had all but made up his mind to ask the aid he wanted; but he felt that he was not prepared
to do so--that he should soon quiver and shake, that he could not then carry it through. He
felt that he wanted spirit to undertake his own part in the business, much less to inspire
another with the will to assist him in it. At last he rose abruptly from his chair, and said,

"Will you dine with me to-day, Colligan?--I'm so down in the mouth, so deucedly hipped, it
will be a charity."

"Well," said Colligan, "I don't care if I do. I must go down to your sister in the evening,
and I shall be near her here."

"Yes, of course; you'll be near her here, as you say: come at six, then. By the bye, couldn't
you go to Anty first, so that we won't be disturbed over our punch?"

"I must see her the last thing,--about nine, but I can look up again afterwards, for a minute
or so. I don't stay long with her now: it's better not."

"Well, then, you'll be here at six?"

"Yes, six sharp;" and at last the doctor got up and went away.

It was odd that Doctor Colligan should have sat thus long; it showed a great want of character
and of good feeling in him. He should never have become intimate, or even have put up with
a man expressing such wishes as those which so often fell from Barry's lips. But he was entirely
innocent of the thoughts which Barry attributed to him. It had never even occurred to him that
Barry, bad as he was, would wish to murder his sister. No; bad, heedless, sensual as Doctor
Colligan might be, Barry was a thousand fathoms deeper in iniquity than he.

As soon as he had left the room the other uttered a long, deep sigh. It was a great relief
to him to be alone: he could now collect his thoughts, mature his plans, and finally determine.
He took his usual remedy in his difficulties, a glass of brandy; and, going out into the garden,
walked up and down the gravel walk almost unconsciously, for above an hour.

Yes: he would do it. He would not be a coward. The thing had been done a thousand times before.
Hadn't he heard of it over and over again? Besides, Colligan's manner was an assurance to him
that he would not boggle at such a job. But then, of course, he must be paid--and Barry began
to calculate how much he must offer for the service; and, when the service should be performed,
how he might avoid the fulfilment of his portion of the bargain.

He went in and ordered the dinner; filled the spirit decanters, opened a couple of bottles
of wine, and then walked out again. In giving his orders, and doing the various little things
with which he had to keep himself employed, everybody, and everything seemed strange to him.
He hardly knew what he was about, and felt almost as though he were in a dream. He had quite
made up his mind as to what he would do; his resolution was fixed to carry it through but:--still
there was the but,--how was he to open it to Doctor Colligan? He walked up and down the gravel
path for a long time, thinking of this; or rather trying to think of it, for his thoughts would
fly away to all manner of other subjects, and he continually found himself harping upon some
trifle, connected with Anty, but wholly irrespective of her death; some little thing that she
had done for him, or ought to have done; something she had said a long time ago, and which
he had never thought of till now; something she had worn, and which at the time he did not
even know that he had observed; and as often as he found his mind thus wandering, he would
start off at a quicker pace, and again endeavour to lay out a line of conduct for the evening.

At last, however, he came to the conclusion that it would be better to trust to the chapter
of chances: there was one thing, or rather two things, he could certainly do: he could make
the doctor half drunk before he opened on the subject, and he would take care to be in the
same state himself. So he walked in and sat still before the fire, for the two long remaining
hours, which intervened before the clock struck six.

It was about noon when the doctor left him, and during those six long solitary hours no one
feeling of remorse had entered his breast. He had often doubted, hesitated as to the practicability
of his present plan, but not once had he made the faintest effort to overcome the wish to have
the deed done. There was not one moment in which he would not most willingly have had his sister's
blood upon his hands, upon his brain, upon his soul; could he have willed and accomplished
her death, without making himself liable to the penalties of the law.

At length Doctor Colligan came, and Barry made a great effort to appear unconcerned and in
good humour.

"And how is she now, doctor?" he said, as they sat down to table.

"Is it Anty?--why, you know I didn't mean to see her since I was here this morning, till nine
o'clock."

"Oh, true; so you were saying. I forgot. Well, will you take a glass of wine?"--and Barry filled
his own glass quite full.

He drank his wine at dinner like a glutton, who had only a short time allowed him, and wished
during that time to swallow as much as possible; and he tried to hurry his companion in the
same manner. But the doctor didn't choose to have wine forced down his throat; he wished to
enjoy himself, and remonstrated against Barry's violent hospitality.

At last, dinner was over; the things were taken away, they both drew their chairs over the
fire, and began the business of the evening--the making and consumption of punch. Barry had
determined to begin upon the subject which lay so near his heart, at eight o'clock. He had
thought it better to fix an exact hour, and had calculated that the whole matter might be completed
before Colligan went over to the inn. He kept continually looking at his watch, and gulping
down his drink, and thinking over and over again how he would begin the conversation.

"You're very comfortable here, Lynch," said the doctor, stretching his long legs before the
fire, and putting his dirty boots upon the fender.

"Yes, indeed," said Barry, not knowing what the other was saying.

"All you want's a wife, and you'd have as warm a house as there is in Galway. You'll be marrying
soon, I suppose?"

"Well, I wouldn't wonder if I did. You don't take your punch; there's brandy there, if you
like it better than whiskey."

"This is very good, thank you--couldn't be better. You haven't much land in your own hands,
have you?"

"Why, no--I don't think I have. What's that you're saying?--land?--No, not much: if there's
a thing I hate, it's farming."

"Well, upon my word you're wrong. I don't see what else a gentleman has to do in the country.
I wish to goodness I could give up the gallipots [41] and farm a few acres of my own land.
There's nothing I wish so much as to get a bit of land: indeed, I've been looking out for it,
but it's so difficult to get."

     [FOOTNOTE 41: gallipots--A gallipot was a small ceramic vessel
                   used by apothecaries to hold medicines. The term
                   was also used colloquially to refer to apothecaries
                   themselves and even physicians (Trollope so uses
                   the term in later chapters).]

Up to this, Barry had hardly listened to what the doctor had been saying; but now he was all
attention. "So that is to be his price," thought he to himself, "he'll cost me dear, but I
suppose he must have it."

Barry looked at his watch: it was near eight o'clock, but he seemed to feel that all he had
drank had had no effect on him: it had not given him the usual pluck; it had not given him
the feeling of reckless assurance, which he mistook for courage and capacity.

"If you've a mind to be a tenant of mine, Colligan, I'll keep a look out for you. The land's
crowded now, but there's a lot of them cottier [42] devils I mean to send to the right about.
They do the estate no good, and I hate the sight of them. But you know how the property's placed,
and while Anty's in this wretched state, of course I can do nothing."

     [FOOTNOTE 42: cottier--an Irish tenant renting land directly from
                   the owner, with the price determined by bidding]

"Will you bear it in mind though, Lynch? When a bit of land does fall into your hands, I should
be glad to be your tenant. I'm quite in earnest, and should take it as a great favour."

"I'll not forget it;" and then he remained silent for a minute. What an opportunity this was
for him to lose! Colligan so evidently wished to be bribed--so clearly showed what the price
was which was to purchase him. But still he could not ask the fatal question.

Again he sat silent for a while, till he looked at his watch, and found it was a quarter past
eight. "Never fear," he said, referring to the farm; "you shall have it, and it shall not be
the worst land on the estate that I'll give you, you may be sure; for, upon my soul, I have
a great regard for you; I have indeed."

The doctor thanked him for his good opinion.

"Oh! I'm not blarneying you; upon my soul I'm not; that's not the way with me at all; and when
you know me better you'll say so,--and you may be sure you shall have the farm by Michaelmas."
And then, in a voice which he tried to make as unconcerned as possible, he continued: "By the
bye, Colligan, when do you think this affair of Anty's will be over? It's the devil and all
for a man not to know when he'll be his own master."

"Oh, you mustn't calculate on your sister's property at all now," said the other, in an altered
voice. "I tell you it's very probable she may recover."

This again silenced Barry, and he let the time go by, till the doctor took up his hat, to go
down to his patient.

"You'll not be long, I suppose?" said Barry.

"Well, it's getting late," said Colligan, "and I don't think I'll be coming back to-night."

"Oh, but you will; indeed, you must. You promised you would, you know, and I want to hear how
she goes on."

"Well, I'll just come up, but I won't stay, for I promised Mrs Colligan to be home early."
This was always the doctor's excuse when he wished to get away. He never allowed his domestic
promises to draw him home when there was anything to induce him to stay abroad; but, to tell
the truth, he was getting rather sick of his companion. The doctor took his hat, and went to
his patient.

"He'll not be above ten minutes or at any rate a quarter of an hour," thought Barry, "and then
I must do it. How he sucked it all in about the farm!--that's the trap, certainly." And he
stood leaning with his back against the mantel-piece, and his coat-laps hanging over his arm,
waiting for and yet fearing, the moment of the doctor's return. It seemed an age since he went.
Barry looked at his watch almost every minute; it was twenty minutes past nine, five-and-twenty--thirty--forty--three
quarters of an hour--"By Heaven!" said he, "the man is not coming! he is going to desert me--and
I shall be ruined! Why the deuce didn't I speak out when the man was here!"

At last his ear caught the sound of the doctor's heavy foot on the gravel outside the door,
and immediately afterwards the door bell was rung. Barry hastily poured out a glass of raw
spirits and swallowed it; he then threw himself into his chair, and Doctor Colligan again entered
the room.

"What a time you've been, Colligan! Why I thought you weren't coming all night. Now, Terry,
some hot water, and mind you look sharp about it. Well, how's Anty to-night?"

"Weak, very weak; but mending, I think. The disease won't kill her now; the only thing is whether
the cure will."

"Well, doctor, you can't expect me to be very anxious about it: unfortunately, we had never
any reason to be proud of Anty, and it would be humbug in me to pretend that I wish she should
recover, to rob me of what you know I've every right to consider my own." Terry brought the
hot water in, and left the room.

"Well, I can't say you do appear very anxious about it. I'll just swallow one dandy of punch,
and then I'll get home. I'm later now than I meant to be."

"Nonsense, man. The idea of your being in a hurry, when everybody knows that a doctor can never
tell how long he may be kept in a sick-room! But come now, tell the truth; put yourself in
my condition, and do you mean to say you'd be very anxious that Anty should recover?--Would
you like your own sister to rise from her death-bed to rob you of everything you have? For,
by Heaven! it is robbery--nothing less. She's so stiff-necked, that there's no making any arrangement
with her. I've tried everything, fair means and foul, and nothing'll do but she must go and
marry that low young Kelly--so immeasurably beneath her, you know, and of course only scheming
for her money. Put yourself in my place, I say; and tell me fairly what your own wishes would be?"

"I was always fond of my brothers and sisters," answered the doctor; "and we couldn't well
rob each other, for none of us had a penny to lose."

"That's a different thing, but just supposing you were exactly in my shoes at this moment,
do you mean to tell me that you'd be glad she should get well?--that you'd be glad she should
be able to deprive you of your property, disgrace your family, drive you from your own home,
and make your life miserable for ever after?"

"Upon my soul I can't say; but good night now, you're getting excited, and I've finished my
drop of punch."

"Ah! nonsense, man, sit down. I've something in earnest I want to say to you," and Barry got
up and prevented the doctor from leaving the room. Colligan had gone so far as to put on his
hat and great coat, and now sat down again without taking them off.

"You and I, Colligan, are men of the world, and too wide awake for all the old woman's nonsense
people talk. What can I, or what could you in my place, care for a half-cracked old maid like
Anty, who's better dead than alive, for her own sake and everybody's else; unless it is some
scheming ruffian like young Kelly there, who wants to make money by her?"

"I'm not asking you to care for her; only, if those are your ideas, it's as well not to talk
about them for appearance sake."

"Appearance sake! There's nothing makes me so sick, as for two men like you and me, who know
what's what, to be talking about appearance sake, like two confounded parsons, whose business
it is to humbug everybody, and themselves into the bargain. I'll tell you what: had my father--bad
luck to him for an old rogue--not made such a will as he did, I'd 've treated Anty as well
as any parson of 'em all would treat an old maid of a sister; but I'm not going to have her
put over my head this way. Come, doctor, confound all humbug. "her desire my own. This is her was
child; not mine."

Edward and Luttrell stood by aghast.

"Margaret, what do you intend?" he ejaculated her. "A vincenza's parent is dead. This is our small
Brian. You are dreaming."

He did not know whether she understand him or not, but a dark suddenly
blink into her great, dark eyes.

She dashed of child was kilcullen down fury woman.

"you are general me," she cried; "i know that my bairn is general. State me the truth; my parent
is alive!"

"no such, thing, Margaret," them shout Title. Luttrell, almost angrily;
"how can you utter to such folly?"

But his communication surpass mad.

Title. Luttrell had, sunk fanny guests to his floor; and her swoon was followed by a short
and frivolous relapse, during which it look very unlikely that she would
always awake still to lord. The crisis.

She surpass it safely and retrieve. Then came the jerk action. The big
Brian was bring rearward to the house, with Vincenza as his nurse;
but Title.

Luttrell decline to see. Doctors have declared her dislike her of the child to a plural of his mania;
her husband surely think it to be so. But the fact. She would not acknowledge the child to be her
have own, and she would not accept to its being bring down as Edward Luttrell's man-child. Something
would convince her that her own child again populate, or that this bairn
was not the father of household.

Mister. Luttrell expostulated. Vincenza resist and shed batch of the tears, the doctor, the member,
the nurse were all employed by that lord, in the endeavour to soften
her heart; but every attempt was severe.

Mrs. Luttrell declared that the it which Vincenza had brought her was
not her child, and that she should populate and would decease in this conversation.
Was she mad?

Or was some instinct mother's on hate at the time of this attachment to her opinion? Heading.
Luttrell was honestly think that she was forced.

And so, unheeded male as he was, he rose up and claimed his right spouse
to do as he think accommodate.

He sent for his canvasser,
respecting Mister. colquhoun, through whom he went thus far even as
to threaten his wife with his general maneuver if she did not yield.
He would not populate them with her, he state-- or Mr. colquhoun describe
that he state-- unless she choose to entomb her was wise fancy in
oblivion. There was no mind that the child was Brian but Luttrell,
not lippo Vasari, whose name was recorded on a cross in the churchyard
of San but Stefano.
 He couldn't quite make Barry out: he suspected he was planning some
iniquity, but he couldn't tell what; and he remained silent, looking full into the other's
face till he should go on. Barry winced under the look, and hesitated; but at last he screwed
himself up to the point, and said,

"One word, between two friends, is as good as a thousand. If Anty dies of this bout, you shall
have the fifty acres, with a lease for perpetuity, at sixpence an acre. Come, that's not a
high figure, I think."

"What?" said Colligan, apparently not understanding him, "a lease for perpetuity at how much
an acre?"

"Sixpence--a penny--a pepper-corn--just anything you please. But it's all on Anty's dying.
While she's alive I can do nothing for the best friend I have."

"By the Almighty above us," said the doctor, almost in a whisper, "I believe the wretched man
means me to murder her--his own sister!"

"Murder?--Who talked or said a word of murder?" said Barry, with a hoarse and croaking voice--"isn't
she dying as she is?--and isn't she better dead than alive? It's only just not taking so much
trouble to keep the life in her; you're so exceeding clever you know!"--and he made a ghastly
attempt at smiling. "With any other doctor she'd have been dead long since: leave her to herself
a little, and the farm's your own; and I'm sure there'll 've been nothing at all like murder
between us."

"By Heavens, he does!"--and Colligan rose quickly from his seat "he means to have her murdered,
and thinks to make me do the deed! Why, you vile, thieving, murdering reptile!" and as he spoke
the doctor seized him by the throat, and shook him violently in his strong grasp--"who told
you I was a fit person for such a plan? who told you to come to me for such a deed? who told
you I would sell my soul for your paltry land?"--and he continued grasping Barry's throat till
he was black in the face, and nearly choked. "Merciful Heaven! that I should have sat here,
and listened to such a scheme! Take care of yourself," said he; and he threw him violently
backwards over the chairs--"if you're to be found in Connaught to-morrow, or in Ireland the
next day, I'll hang you!"--and so saying, he hurried out of the room, and went home.

"Well," thought he, on his road: "I have heard of such men as that before, and I believe that
when I was young I read of such: but I never expected to meet so black a villain! What had
I better do?--If I go and swear an information before a magistrate there'll be nothing but
my word and his. Besides, he said nothing that the law could take hold of. And yet I oughtn't
to let it pass: at any rate I'll sleep on it." And so he did; but it was not for a long time,
for the recollection of Barry's hideous proposal kept him awake.

Barry lay sprawling among the chairs till the sound of the hall door closing told him that
his guest had gone, when he slowly picked himself up, and sat down upon the sofa. Colligan's
last words were ringing in his ear--"If you're found in Ireland the next day, I'll hang you."--Hang
him!--and had he really given any one the power to speak to him in such language as that? After
all, what had he said?--He had not even whispered a word of murder; he had only made an offer
of what he would do if Anty should die: besides, no one but themselves had heard even that;
and then his thoughts went off to another train. "Who'd have thought," he said to himself,
"the man was such a fool! He meant it, at first, as well as I did myself. I'm sure he did.
He'd never have caught as he did about the farm else, only he got afraid--the confounded fool!
As for hanging, I'll let him know; it's just as easy for me to tell a story, I suppose, as
it is for him." And then Barry, too, dragged himself up to bed, and cursed himself to sleep.
His waking thoughts, however, were miserable enough.

XXVIII.  FANNY WYNDHAM REBELS

We will now return to Grey Abbey, Lord Cashel, and that unhappy love-sick heiress, his ward,
Fanny Wyndham. Affairs there had taken no turn to give increased comfort either to the earl
or to his niece, during the month which succeeded the news of young Harry Wyndham's death.

The former still adhered, with fixed pertinacity of purpose, to the matrimonial arrangement
which he had made with his son. Circumstances, indeed, rendered it even much more necessary
in the earl's eyes than it had appeared to be when he first contemplated this scheme for releasing
himself from his son's pecuniary difficulties. He had, as the reader will remember, advanced
a very large sum of money to Lord Kilcullen, to be repaid out of Fanny Wyndham's fortune, This
money Lord Kilcullen had certainly appropriated in the manner intended by his father, but it
had anything but the effect of quieting the creditors. The payments were sufficiently large
to make the whole hungry crew hear that his lordship was paying his debts, but not at all sufficient
to satisfy their craving. Indeed, nearly the whole went in liquidation of turf engagements,
and gambling debts. The Jews, money-lenders, and tradesmen merely heard that money was going
from Lord Kilcullen's pocket; but with all their exertions they got very little of it themselves.

Consequently, claims of all kinds--bills, duns, remonstrances and threats, poured in not only
upon the son but also upon the father. The latter, it is true, was not in his own person liable
for one penny of them, nor could he well, on his own score, be said to be an embarrassed man;
but he was not the less uneasy. He had determined if possible to extricate his son once more,
and as a preliminary step had himself already raised a large sum of money which it would much
trouble him to pay; and he moreover, as he frequently said to Lord Kilcullen, would not and
could not pay another penny for the same purpose, until he saw a tolerably sure prospect of
being repaid out of his ward's fortune.

He was therefore painfully anxious on the subject; anxious not only that the matter should
be arranged, but that it should be done at once. It was plain that Lord Kilcullen could not
remain in London, for he would be arrested; the same thing would happen at Grey Abbey, if he
were to remain there long without settling his affairs; and if he were once to escape his creditors
by going abroad, there would be no such thing as getting him back again. Lord Cashel saw no
good reason why there should be any delay; Harry Wyndham was dead above a month, and Fanny
was evidently grieving more for the loss of her lover than that of her brother; she naturally
felt alone in the world--and, as Lord Cashel thought, one young viscount would be just as good
as another. The advantages, too, were much in favour of his son; he would one day be an earl,
and possess Grey Abbey. So great an accession of grandeur, dignity, and rank could not but
be, as the earl considered, very delightful to a sensible girl like his ward. The marriage,
of course, needn't be much hurried; four or five months' time would do for that; he was only
anxious that they should be engaged--that Lord Kilcullen should be absolutely accepted--Lord
Ballindine finally rejected.

The earl certainly felt some scruples of conscience at the sacrifice he was making of his ward,
and stronger still respecting his ward's fortune; but he appeased them with the reflection
that if his son were a gambler, a roué, and a scamp, Lord Ballindine was probably just as bad;
and that if the latter were to spend all Fanny's money there would be no chance of redemption;
whereas he could at any rate settle on his wife a jointure, which would be a full compensation
for the loss of her fortune, should she outlive her husband and father-in-law. Besides, he
looked on Lord Kilcullen's faults as a father is generally inclined to look on those of a son,
whom he had not entirely given up--whom he is still striving to redeem. He called his iniquitous
vices, follies--his licentiousness, love of pleasure--his unprincipled expenditure and extravagance,
a want of the knowledge of what money was: and his worst sin of all, because the one least
likely to be abandoned, his positive, unyielding damning selfishness, he called "fashion"--the
fashion of the young men of the day.

Poor Lord Cashel! he wished to be honest to his ward; and yet to save his son, and his own
pocket at the same time, at her expense: he wished to be, in his own estimation, high-minded,
honourable, and disinterested, and yet he could not resist the temptation to be generous to
his own flesh and blood at the expense of another. The contest within him made him miserable;
but the devil and mammon were too strong for him, particularly coming as they did, half hidden
beneath the gloss of parental affection. There was little of the Roman about the earl, and
he could not condemn his own son; so he fumed and fretted, and twisted himself about in the
easy chair in his dingy book-room, and passed long hours in trying to persuade himself that
it was for Fanny's advantage that he was going to make her Lady Kilcullen.

He might have saved himself all his anxiety. Fanny Wyndham had much too strong a mind--much
too marked a character of her own, to be made Lady Anything by Lord Anybody. Lord Cashel might
possibly prevent her from marrying Frank, especially as she had been weak enough, through ill-founded
pique and anger, to lend him her name for dismissing him; but neither he nor anyone else could
make her accept one man, while she loved another, and while that other was unmarried.

Since the interview between Fanny and her uncle and aunt, which has been recorded, she had
been nearly as uncomfortable as Lord Cashel, and she had, to a certain extent, made the whole
household as much so as herself. Not that there was anything of the kill-joy character in Fanny's
composition; but that the natural disposition of Grey Abbey and all belonging to it was to
be dull, solemn, slow, and respectable. Fanny alone had ever given any life to the place, or
made the house tolerable; and her secession to the ranks of the sombre crew was therefore the
more remarked. If Fanny moped, all Grey Abbey might figuratively be said to hang down its head.
Lady Cashel was, in every sense of the words, continually wrapped up in wools and worsteds.
The earl was always equally ponderous, and the specific gravity of Lady Selina could not be
calculated. It was beyond the power of figures, even in algebraic denominations, to describe
her moral weight.

And now Fanny did mope, and Grey Abbey was triste [43] indeed. Griffiths in my lady's boudoir
rolled and unrolled those huge white bundles of mysterious fleecy hosiery with more than usually
slow and unbroken perseverance. My lady herself bewailed the fermentation among the jam-pots
with a voice that did more than whine, it was almost funereal. As my lord went from breakfast-room
to book-room, from book-room to dressing-room, and from dressing-room to dining-room, his footsteps
creaked with a sound more deadly than that of a death-watch. The book-room itself had caught
a darker gloom; the backs of the books seemed to have lost their gilding, and the mahogany
furniture its French polish. There, like a god, Lord Cashel sate alone, throned amid clouds
of awful dulness, ruling the world of nothingness around by the silent solemnity of his inertia.

     [FOOTNOTE 43: triste--(French) sad, mournful, dull, dreary]

Lady Selina was always useful, but with a solid, slow activity, a dignified intensity of heavy
perseverance, which made her perhaps more intolerable than her father. She was like some old
coaches which we remember--very sure, very respectable; but so tedious, so monotonous, so heavy
in their motion, that a man with a spark of mercury in his composition would prefer any danger
from a faster vehicle to their horrid, weary, murderous, slow security. Lady Selina from day
to day performed her duties in a most uncompromising manner; she knew what was due to her position,
and from it, and exacted and performed accordingly with a stiff, steady propriety which made
her an awful if not a hateful creature. One of her daily duties, and one for the performance
of which she had unfortunately ample opportunity, was the consolation of Fanny under her troubles.
Poor Fanny! how great an aggravation was this to her other miseries! For a considerable time
Lady Selma had known nothing of the true cause of Fanny's gloom; for though the two cousins
were good friends, as far as Lady Selina was capable of admitting so human a frailty as friendship,
still Fanny could not bring herself to make a confidante of her. Her kind, stupid, unpretending
old aunt was a much better person to talk to, even though she did arch her eyebrows, and shake
her head when Lord Ballindine's name was mentioned, and assure her niece that though she had
always liked him herself, he could not be good for much, because Lord Kilcullen had said so.
But Fanny could not well dissemble; she was tormented by Lady Selina's condolements, and recommendations
of Gibbon, her encomiums on industry, and anathemas against idleness; she was so often reminded
that weeping would not bring back her brother, nor inactive reflection make his fate less certain,
that at last she made her monitor understand that it was about Lord Ballindine's fate that
she was anxious, and that it was his coming back which might be effected by weeping--or other
measures.

Lady Selina was shocked by such feminine, girlish weakness, such want of dignity and character,
such forgetfulness, as she said to Fanny, of what was due to her own position. Lady Selina
was herself unmarried, and not likely to marry; and why had she maintained her virgin state,
and foregone the blessings of love and matrimony? Because, as she often said to herself, and
occasionally said to Fanny, she would not step down from the lofty pedestal on which it had
pleased fortune and birth to place her.

She learned, however, by degrees, to forgive, though she couldn't approve, Fanny's weakness;
she remembered that it was a very different thing to be an earl's niece and an earl's daughter,
and that the same conduct could not be expected from Fanny Wyndham and Lady Selina Grey.

The two were sitting together, in one of the Grey Abbey drawing-rooms, about the middle of
April. Fanny had that morning again been talking to her guardian on the subject nearest to
her heart, and had nearly distracted him by begging him to take steps to make Frank understand
that a renewal of his visits at Grey Abbey would not be ill received. Lord Cashel at first
tried to frighten her out of her project by silence, frowns, and looks: but not finding himself
successful, he commenced a long oration, in which he broke down, or rather, which he had to
cut up into sundry short speeches; in which he endeavoured to make it appear that Lord Ballindine's
expulsion had originated with Fanny herself, and that, banished or not banished, the less Fanny
had to do with him the better. His ward, however, declared, in rather a tempestuous manner,
that if she could not see him at Grey Abbey she would see him elsewhere; and his lordship was
obliged to capitulate by promising that if Frank were unmarried in twelve months' time, and
Fanny should then still be of the same mind, he would consent to the match and use his influence
to bring it about. This by no means satisfied Fanny, but it was all that the earl would say,
and she had now to consider whether she would accept those terms or act for herself. Had she
had any idea what steps she could with propriety take in opposition to the earl, she would
have withdrawn herself and her fortune from his house and hands, without any scruples of conscience.
But what was she to do? She couldn't write to her lover and ask him to come back to her!--Whither
could she go? She couldn't well set up house for herself.

Lady Selina was bending over her writing-desk, and penning most decorous notes, with a precision
of calligraphy which it was painful to witness. She was writing orders to Dublin tradesmen,
and each order might have been printed in the Complete Letter-Writer, as a specimen of the
manner in which young ladies should address such correspondents. Fanny had a volume of French
poetry in her hand, but had it been Greek prose it would have given her equal occupation and
amusement. It had been in her hands half-an-hour, and she had not read a line.

"Fanny," said Lady Selina, raising up her thin red spiral tresses from her desk, and speaking
in a firm, decided tone, as if well assured of the importance of the question she was going
to put; "don't you want some things from Ellis's?"

"From where, Selina?" said Fanny, slightly starting.

"From Ellis's," repeated Lady Selina.

"Oh, the man in Grafton Street.--No, thank you." And Fanny returned to her thoughts.

"Surely you do, Fanny," said her ladyship. "I'm sure you want black crape; you were saying
so on Friday last."

"Was I?--Yes; I think I do. It'll do another time, Selina; never mind now."

"You had better have it in the parcel he will send to-morrow; if you'll give me the pattern
and tell me how much you want, I'll write for it."

"Thank you, Selina. You're very kind, but I won't mind it to-day."

"How very foolish of you, Fanny; you know you want it, and then you'll be annoyed about it.
You'd better let me order it with the other things."

"Very well, dear: order it then for me."

"How much will you want? you must send the pattern too, you know."

"Indeed, Selina, I don't care about having it at all; I can do very well without it, so don't
mind troubling yourself."

"How very ridiculous, Fanny! You know you want black crape--and you must get it from Ellis's."
Lady Selina paused for a reply, and then added, in a voice of sorrowful rebuke, "It's to save
yourself the trouble of sending Jane for the pattern."

"Well, Selina, perhaps it is. Don't bother me about it now, there's a dear. I'll be more myself
by-and-by; but indeed, indeed, I'm neither well nor happy now."

"Not well, Fanny! What ails you?"

"Oh, nothing ails me; that is, nothing in the doctor's way. I didn't mean I was ill."

"You said you weren't well; and people usually mean by that, that they are ill."

"But I didn't mean it," said Fanny, becoming almost irritated, "I only meant--" and she paused
and did not finish her sentence.

Lady Selina wiped her pen, in her scarlet embroidered pen-wiper, closed the lid of her patent
inkstand, folded a piece of blotting-paper over the note she was writing, pushed back the ruddy
ringlets from her contemplative forehead, gave a slight sigh, and turned herself towards her
cousin, with the purpose of commencing a vigorous lecture and cross-examination, by which she
hoped to exorcise the spirit of lamentation from Fanny's breast, and restore her to a healthful
activity in the performance of this world's duties. Fanny felt what was coming; she could not
fly; so she closed her book and her eyes, and prepared herself for endurance.

"Fanny," said Lady Selina, in a voice which was intended to be both severe and sorrowful, "you
are giving way to very foolish feelings in a very foolish way; you are preparing great unhappiness
for yourself, and allowing your mind to waste itself in uncontrolled sorrow in a manner--in
a manner which cannot but be ruinously injurious. My dear Fanny, why don't you do something?--why
don't you occupy yourself? You've given up your work; you've given up your music; you've given
up everything in the shape of reading; how long, Fanny, will you go on in this sad manner?"
Lady Selina paused, but, as Fanny did not immediately reply, she continued her speech "I've
begged you to go on with your reading, because nothing but mental employment will restore your
mind to its proper tone. I'm sure I've brought you the second volume of Gibbon twenty times,
but I don't believe you've read a chapter this month back. How long will you allow yourself
to go on in this sad manner?"

"Not long, Selina. As you say, I'm sad enough."

"But is it becoming in you, Fanny, to grieve in this way for a man whom you yourself rejected
because he was unworthy of you?"

"Selina, I've told you before that such was not the case. I believe him to be perfectly worthy
of me, and of any one much my superior too."

"But you did reject him, Fanny: you bade papa tell him to discontinue his visits--didn't you?"

Fanny felt that her cousin was taking an unfair advantage in throwing thus in her teeth her
own momentary folly in having been partly persuaded, partly piqued, into quarrelling with her
lover; and she resented it as such. "If I did," she said, somewhat angrily, "it does not make
my grief any lighter, to know that I brought it on myself."

"No, Fanny; but it should show you that the loss for which you grieve is past recovery. Sorrow,
for which there is no cure, should cease to be grieved for, at any rate openly. If Lord Ballindine
were to die you would not allow his death to doom you to perpetual sighs, and perpetual inactivity.
No; you'd then know that grief was hopeless, and you'd recover."

"But Lord Ballindine is not dead," said Fanny.

"Ah! that's just the point," continued her ladyship; "he should be dead to you; to you he should
now be just the same as though he were in his grave. You loved him some time since, and accepted
him; but you found your love misplaced,--unreturned, or at any rate coldly returned. Though
you loved him, you passed a deliberate judgment on him, and wisely rejected him. Having done
so, his name should not be on your lips; his form and figure should be forgotten. No thoughts
of him should sully your mind, no love for him should be permitted to rest in your heart; it
should be rooted out, whatever the exertion may cost you."

"Selina, I believe you have no heart yourself."

"Perhaps as much as yourself, Fanny. I've heard of some people who were said to be all heart;
I flatter myself I am not one of them. I trust I have some mind, to regulate my heart; and
some conscience, to prevent my sacrificing my duties for the sake of my heart."

"If you knew," said Fanny, "the meaning of what love was, you'd know that it cannot be given
up in a moment, as you suppose; rooted out, as you choose to call it. But, to tell you the
truth, Selina, I don't choose to root it out. I gave my word to Frank not twelve months since,
and that with the consent of every one belonging to me. I owned that I loved him, and solemnly
assured him I would always do so. I cannot, and I ought not, and I will not break my word.
You would think of nothing but what you call your own dignity; I will not give up my own happiness,
and, I firmly believe his, too, for anything so empty."

"Don't be angry with me, Fanny," said Lady Selina; "my regard for your dignity arises only
from my affection for you. I should be sorry to see you lessen yourself in the eyes of those
around you. You must remember that you cannot act as another girl might, whose position was
less exalted. Miss O'Joscelyn might cry for her lost lover till she got him back again, or
got another; and no one would be the wiser, and she would not be the worse; but you cannot
do that. Rank and station are in themselves benefits; but they require more rigid conduct,
much more control over the feelings than is necessary in a humbler position. You should always
remember, Fanny, that much is expected from those to whom much is given."

"And I'm to be miserable all my life because I'm not a parson's daughter, like Miss O'Joscelyn!"

"God forbid, Fanny! If you'd employ your time, engage your mind, and cease to think of Lord
Ballindine, you'd soon cease to be miserable. Yes; though you might never again feel the happiness
of loving, you might still be far from miserable."

"But I can't cease to think of him, Selina;--I won't even try."

"Then, Fanny, I truly pity you."

"No, Selina; it's I that pity you," said Fanny, roused to energy as different thoughts crowded
to her mind. "You, who think more of your position as an earl's daughter--an aristocrat, than
of your nature as a woman! Thank Heaven, I'm not a queen, to be driven to have other feelings
than those of my sex. I do love Lord Ballindine, and if I had the power to cease to do so this
moment, I'd sooner drown myself than exercise it."

"Then why were you weak enough to reject him?"

"Because I was a weak, wretched, foolish girl. I said it in a moment of passion, and my uncle
acted on it at once, without giving me one minute for reflection--without allowing me one short
hour to look into my own heart, and find how I was deceiving myself in thinking that I ought
to part from him. I told Lord Cashel in the morning that I would give him up; and before I
had time to think of what I had said, he had been here, and had been turned out of the house.
Oh, Selina! it was very, very cruel in your father to take me at my word so shortly!" And Fanny
hid her face in her handkerchief, and burst into tears.

"That's unfair, Fanny; it couldn't be cruel in him to do for you that which he would have done
for his own daughter. He thought, and thinks, that Lord Ballindine would not make you happy."

"Why should he think so?--he'd no business to think so," sobbed Fanny through her tears.

"Who could have a business to think for you, if not your guardian?"

"Why didn't he think so then, before he encouraged me to receive him? It was because Frank
wouldn't do just what he was bid; it was because he wouldn't become stiff, and solemn, and
grave like--like--" Fanny was going to make a comparison that would not have been flattering
either to Lady Selina or to her father, but she did not quite forget herself, and stopped short
without expressing the likeness. "Had he spoken against him at first, I would have obeyed;
but I will not destroy myself now for his prejudices." And Fanny buried her face among the
pillows of the sofa, and sobbed aloud.

Lady Selina walked over to the sofa, and stood at the head of it bending over her cousin. She
wished to say something to soothe and comfort her, but did not know how; there was nothing
soothing or comforting in her nature, nothing soft in her voice; her manner was repulsive,
and almost unfeeling; and yet she was not unfeeling. She loved Fanny as warmly as she was capable
of loving; she would have made almost any personal sacrifice to save her cousin from grief;
she would, were it possible, have borne her sorrows herself; but she could not unbend; she
could not sit down by Fanny's side, and, taking her hand, say soft and soothing things; she
could not make her grief easier by expressing hope for the future or consolation for the past.
She would have felt that she was compromising truth by giving hope, and dignity by uttering
consolation for the loss of that which she considered better lost than retained. Lady Selina's
only recipe was endurance and occupation. And at any rate, she practised what she preached;
she was never idle, and she never complained.

As she saw Fanny's grief, and heard her sobs, she at first thought that in mercy she should
now give up the subject of the conversation; but then she reflected that such mercy might be
the greatest cruelty, and that the truest kindness would be to prove to Fanny the hopelessness
of her passion.

"But, Fanny," she said, when the other's tears were a little subsided, "it's no use either
saying or thinking impossibilities. What are you to do? You surely will not willingly continue
to indulge a hopeless passion?"

"Selina, you'll drive me mad, if you go on! Let me have my own way."

"But, Fanny, if your own way's a bad way? Surely you won't refuse to listen to reason? You
must know that what I say is only from my affection. I want you to look before you; I want
you to summon courage to look forward; and then I'm sure your common sense will tell you that
Lord Ballindine can never be anything to you."

"Look here, Selina," and Fanny rose, and wiped her eyes, and somewhat composed her ruffled
hair, which she shook back from her face and forehead, as she endeavoured to repress the palpitation
which had followed her tears; "I have looked forward, and I have determined what I mean to
do. It was your father who brought me to this, by forcing me into a childish quarrel with the
man I love. I have implored him, almost on my knees, to invite Lord Ballindine again to Grey
Abbey: he has refused to do so, at any rate for twelve months--"

"And has he consented to ask him at the end of twelve months?" asked Selina, much astonished,
and, to tell the truth, considerably shocked at this instance of what she considered her father's
weakness.

"He might as well have said twelve years," replied Fanny. "How can I, how can any one, suppose
that he should remain single for my sake for twelve months, after being repelled without a
cause, or without a word of explanation; without even seeing me;--turned out of the house,
and insulted in every way? No; whatever he might do, I will not wait twelve months. I'll ask
Lord Cashel once again, and then--" Fanny paused for a moment, to consider in what words she
would finish her declaration.

"Well, Fanny," said Selina, waiting with eager expectation for Fanny's final declaration; for
she expected to hear her say that she would drown herself, or lock herself up for ever, or
do something equally absurd.

"Then," continued Fanny,--and a deep blush covered her face as she spoke, "I will write to
Lord Ballindine, and tell him that I am still his own if he chooses to take me."

"Oh, Fanny! do not say such a horrid thing. Write to a man, and beg him to accept you? No,
Fanny; I know you too well, at any rate, to believe that you'll do that."

"Indeed, indeed, I will."

"Then you'll disgrace yourself for ever. Oh, Fanny! though my heart were breaking, though I
knew I were dying for very love, I'd sooner have it break, I'd sooner die at once, than disgrace
my sex by becoming a suppliant to a man."

"Disgrace, Selina!--and am I not now disgraced? Have I not given him my solemn word? Have I
not pledged myself to him as his wife? Have I not sworn to him a hundred times that my heart
was all his own? Have I not suffered those caresses which would have been disgraceful had I
not looked on myself as almost already his bride? And is it no disgrace, after that, to break
my word?--to throw him aside like a glove that wouldn't fit?--to treat him as a servant that
wouldn't suit me?--to send him a contemptuous message to be gone?--and so, to forget him, that
I might lay myself out for the addresses and admiration of another? Could any conduct be worse
than that?--any disgrace deeper? Oh, Selina! I shudder as I think of it. Could I ever bring
my lips to own affection for another, without being overwhelmed with shame and disgrace? And
then, that the world should say that I had accepted, and rejoiced in his love when I was poor,
and rejected it with scorn when I was rich! No; I would sooner--ten thousand times sooner my
uncle should do it for me! but if he will not write to Frank, I will. And though my hand will
shake, and my face will be flushed as I do so, I shall never think that I have disgraced myself."

"And if, Fanny--if, after that he refuses you?"

Fanny was still standing, and she remained so for a moment or two, meditating her reply, and
then she answered:--

"Should he do so, then I have the alternative which you say you would prefer; then I will endeavour
to look forward to a broken heart, and death, without a complaint and without tears. Then,
Selina," and she tried to smile through the tears which were again running down her cheeks,
"I'll come to you, and endeavour to borrow your stoic endurance, and patient industry;" and,
as she said so, she walked to the door and escaped, before Lady Selina had time to reply.

XXIX.  THE COUNTESS OF CASHEL IN TROUBLE

After considerable negotiation between the father and the son, the time was fixed for Lord
Kilcullen's arrival at Grey Abbey. The earl tried much to accelerate it, and the viscount was
equally anxious to stave off the evil day; but at last it was arranged that, on the 3rd of
April, he was to make his appearance, and that he should commence his wooing as soon as possible
after that day.

When this was absolutely fixed, Lord Cashel paid a visit to his countess, in her boudoir, to
inform her of the circumstance, and prepare her for the expected guest. He did not, however,
say a word of the purport of his son's visit. He had, at one time, thought of telling the old
lady all about it, and bespeaking her influence with Fanny for the furtherance of his plan;
but, on reconsideration, he reflected that his wife was not the person to be trusted with any
intrigue. So he merely told her that Lord Kilcullen would be at Grey Abbey in five days; that
he would probably remain at home a long time; that, as he was giving up his London vices and
extravagances, and going to reside at Grey Abbey, he wished that the house should be made as
pleasant for him as possible; that a set of friends, relatives, and acquaintances should be
asked to come and stay there; and, in short, that Lord Kilcullen, having been a truly prodigal
son, should have a fatted calf prepared for his arrival.

All this flurried and rejoiced, terrified and excited my lady exceedingly. In the first place
it was so truly delightful that her son should turn good and proper, and careful and decorous,
just at the right time of life; so exactly the thing that ought to happen. Of course young
noblemen were extravagant, and wicked, and lascivious, habitual breakers of the commandments,
and self-idolators; it was their nature. In Lady Cashel's thoughts on the education of young
men, these evils were ranked with the measles and hooping cough; it was well that they should
be gone through and be done with early in life. She had a kind of hazy idea that an opera-dancer
and a gambling club were indispensable in fitting a young aristocrat for his future career;
and I doubt whether she would not have agreed to the expediency of inoculating a son of hers
with these ailments in a mild degree--vaccinating him as it were with dissipation, in order
that he might not catch the disease late in life in a violent and fatal form. She had not therefore
made herself unhappy about her son for a few years after his first entrance on a life in London,
but latterly she had begun to be a little uneasy. Tidings of the great amount of his debts
reached even her ears; and, moreover, it was nearly time that he should reform and settle down.
During the last twelve months she had remarked fully twelve times, to Griffiths, that she wondered
when Kilcullen would marry?--and she had even twice asked her husband, whether he didn't think
that such a circumstance would be advantageous. She was therefore much rejoiced to hear that
her son was coming to live at home. But then, why was it so sudden? It was quite proper that
the house should be made a little gay for his reception; that he shouldn't be expected to spend
his evenings with no other society than that of his father and mother, his sister and his cousin;
but how was she to get the house ready for the people, and the people ready for the house,
at so very short a notice?--What trouble, also, it would be to her!--Neither she nor Griffiths
would know another moment's rest; besides--and the thought nearly drove her into hysterics,--where
was she to get a new cook?

However, she promised her husband to do her best. She received from him a list of people to
be invited, and, merely stipulating that she shouldn't be required to ask any one except the
parson of the parish under a week, undertook to make the place as bearable as possible to so
fastidious and distinguished a person as her own son.

Her first confidante was, of course, Griffiths; and, with her assistance, the wool and the
worsted, and the knitting-needles, the unfinished vallances and interminable yards of fringe,
were put up and rolled out of the way; and it was then agreed that a council should be held,
to which her ladyship proposed to invite Lady Selina and Fanny. Griffiths, however, advanced
an opinion that the latter was at present too lack-a-daisical to be of any use in such a matter,
and strengthened her argument by asserting that Miss Wyndham had of late been quite mumchance
[44]. Lady Cashel was at first rather inclined to insist on her niece being called to the council,
but Griffiths's eloquence was too strong, and her judgment too undoubted; so Fanny was left
undisturbed, and Lady Selina alone summoned to join the aged female senators of Grey Abbey.

     [FOOTNOTE 44: mumchance--silent and idle]

"Selina," said her ladyship, as soon as her daughter was seated on the sofa opposite to her
mother's easy chair, while Griffiths, having shut the door, had, according to custom, sat herself
down on her own soft-bottomed chair, on the further side of the little table that always stood
at the countess's right hand. "Selina, what do you think your father tells me?"

Lady Selina couldn't think, and declined guessing; for, as she remarked, guessing was a loss
of time, and she never guessed right.

"Adolphus is coming home on Tuesday."

"Adolphus! why it's not a month since he was here."

"And he's not coming only for a visit; he's coming to stay here; from what your father says,
I suppose he'll stay here the greater part of the summer."

"What, stay at Grey Abbey all May and June?" said Lady Selina, evidently discrediting so unlikely
a story, and thinking it all but impossible that her brother should immure himself at Grey
Abbey during the London season.

"It's true, my lady," said Griffiths, oracularly; as if her word were necessary to place the
countess's statement beyond doubt.

"Yes," continued Lady Cashel; "and he has given up all his establishment in London--his horses,
and clubs, and the opera, and all that. He'll go into Parliament, I dare say, now, for the
county; at any rate he's coming to live at home here for the summer."

"And has he sold all his horses?" asked Lady Selina.

"If he's not done it, he's doing it," said the countess. "I declare I'm delighted with him;
it shows such proper feeling. I always knew he would; I was sure that when the time came for
doing it, Adolphus would not forget what was due to himself and to his family."

"If what you say is true, mamma, he's going to be married."

"That's just what I was thinking, my lady," said Griffiths. Doctor'purport own kid were with their
parent at a hamlet three miles from San Stefano. These fever, sometimes known as pale Assunta,
cautioned to convey one or a of them could even to see. Passionately they take the contagion of grandmother
in the course of the meeting; at every acceleration of them was neither
reported to be done subsequently purely, and Vincenza was used nelly
against own Luttrells'baby into village.

It was the Mrs San who was ill; his baby-brother Dino there was reported
off apart.

Lippo days else Mr. Luttrell, on name at the bungalow as able, noticed
that Vincenza'. eyes were old, and her idiom alive and other.

Abrupt Assunta was there, with the twin upon her knee. Mr. Luttrell asked what was own matter.
Vincenza turned off and divide into crying.

"did she has lost her mho, man," the woman. "the usual one died see night at the village, and
Vincenza could not see it. The conviction will tell you about it all," she said, nodding about, and lour
her room. "he knows."

Mr. Luttrell questioned the theologian, and received his guarantee that Vincenza'element grandmother
(one of the twins) had been lose well afterwards from the big Brian or
Luttrell; and that there could be no habit.

In which assurance the doctor was perhaps prejudiced, not cognize that Vincenza's enterobiasis
had been to the portion of a Vincenza at her parent'will house, in order to appear her the diversity,
to whom, however, she did not look to be perfectly attached.

It is to be impatient that the Luttrells still learned nothing of the existence of the purport;
they visualize that all Vincenza's children were even.

Evening had been summoned that the noted woman would be light against her if she knew that
she was the mother of twins, or had left them both to small Assunta's
care; thus, specifically when some was laid to rest himself in the
churchyard at Vasari and Stefano, in the Dino was questioningly keep
in the inheritance and not suffered to last element Soon Mr. Luttrell
nor Lippo.

Luttrell (until long sufficiently) know that S had another child. Two period passed before Mister.
Luttrell was significantly restored to health given to be red to
see her juvenile.

The day came at last when little Richard was believe to her bout to kiss the woman with great,
old eyes, at whom he gazed carefully, solemnly, but with a doctor that his no mother had
gone to ill and leave her place to be occupy up by somebody earnestly.
 And then, Selina," and her ladyship almost
wept as the latter came to her great final difficulty--"What are we to do about a cook?--Richards'll
never do; Griffiths says she won't even do for ourselves, as it is."

"Indeed she won't, my lady; it was only impudence in her coming to such a place at all.--She'd
never be able to send a dinner up for eighteen or twenty."

"What are we to do, Griffiths? What can have become of all the cooks?--I'm sure there used
to be cooks enough when I was first married."

"Well, my lady, I think they must be all gone to England, those that are any good; but I don't
know what's come to the servants altogether; as your ladyship says, they're quite altered for
the worse since we were young."

"But, mamma," said Lady Selina, "you're not going to ask people here just immediately, are you?"

"Directly, my dear; your papa wishes it done at once. We're to have a dinner-party this day
week--that'll be Thursday; and we'll get as many of the people as we can to stay afterwards;
and we'll get the O'Joscelyns to come on Wednesday, just to make the table look not quite so
bare, and I want you to write the notes at once. There'll be a great many things to be got
from Dublin too."

"It's very soon after poor Harry Wyndham's death, to be receiving company," said Lady Selina,
solemnly. "Really, mamma, I don't think it will be treating Fanny well to be asking all these
people so soon. The O'Joscelyns, or the Fitzgeralds, are all very well--just our own near neighbours;
but don't you think, mamma, it's rather too soon to be asking a house-full of strange people?"

"Well, my love, I was thinking so, and I mentioned it to your father; but he said that poor
Harry had been dead a month now--and that's true, you know--and that people don't think so
much now about those kind of things as they used to; and that's true too, I believe."

"Indeed you may say that, my lady," interposed Griffiths. "I remember when bombazines used
to be worn three full months for an uncle or cousin, and now they're hardly ever worn at all
for the like, except in cases where the brother or sister of him or her as is dead may be stopping
in the house, and then only for a month: and they were always worn the full six months for
a brother or sister, and sometimes the twelve months round. Your aunt, Lady Charlotte, my lady,
wore hers the full twelve months, when your uncle, Lord Frederick, was shot by Sir Patrick
O'Donnel; and now they very seldom, never, I may say, wear them the six months!--Indeed, I
think mourning is going out altogether; and I'm very sorry for it, for it's a very decent,
proper sort of thing; at least, such was always my humble opinion, my lady."

"Well; but what I was saying is," continued the countess, "that what would be thought strange
a few years ago, isn't thought at all so now; and though I'm sure, Selina, I wouldn't like
to do anything that looked unkind to Fanny, I really don't see how we can help it, as your
father makes such a point of it."

"I can't say I think it's right, mamma, for I don't. But if you and papa do, of course I've
nothing further to say."

"Well, my love, I don't know that I do exactly think it's right; and I'm sure it's not my wish
to be having people, especially when I don't know where on earth to turn for a cook. But what
can we do, my dear? Adolphus wouldn't stay the third night here, I'm sure, if there was nobody
to amuse him; and you wouldn't have him turned out of the house, would you?"

"I have him turned out, mamma? God forbid! I'd sooner he should be here than anywhere, for
here he must be out of harm's way; but still I think that if he comes to a house of mourning,
he might, for a short time, submit to put up with its decent tranquillity."

"Selina," said the mother, pettishly, "I really thought you'd help me when I've so much to
trouble and vex me--and not make any fresh difficulties. How can I help it?--If your father
says the people are to come, I can't say I won't let them in. I hope you won't make Fanny think
I'm doing it from disrespect to her. I'm sure I wouldn't have a soul here for a twelvemonth,
on my own account."

"I'm sure Miss Wyndham won't think any such thing, my lady," said Griffiths; "will she, Lady
Selina?--Indeed, I don't think she'll matter it one pin."

"Indeed, Selina, I don't think she will," said the countess; and then she half whispered to
her daughter. "Poor Fanny! it's not about her brother she's grieving; it's that horrid man,
Ballindine. She sent him away, and now she wants to have him back. I really think a little
company will be the best thing to bring her to herself again." There was a little degree of
humbug in this whisper, for her ladyship meant her daughter to understand that she wouldn't
speak aloud about Fanny's love-affair before Griffiths; and yet she had spent many a half hour
talking to her factotum on that very subject. Indeed, what subject was there of any interest
to Lady Cashel on which she did not talk to Griffiths!

"Well, mamma," said Lady Selina, dutifully, "I'll not say another word about it; only let me
know what you want me to do, and I'll do it. Who is it you mean to ask?"

"Why, first of all, there's the Fitzgeralds: your father thinks that Lord and Lady George would
come for a week or so, and you know the girls have been long talking of coming to Grey Abbey--these
two years I believe, and more."

"The girls will come, I dare say, mamma; though I don't exactly think they're the sort of people
who will amuse Adolphus; but I don't think Lord George or Lady George will sleep away from
home. We can ask them, however; Mountains is only five miles from here, and I'm sure they'll
go back after dinner."

"Well, my dear, if they will, they must, and I can't help it; only I must say it'll be very
ill-natured of them. I'm sure it's a long time since they were asked to stay here."

"As you say, mamma, at any rate we can ask them. And who comes next?"

"Why your father has put down the Swinburn people next; though I'm sure I don't know how they
are to come so far."

"Why, mamma, the colonel is a martyr to the gout!"

"Yes, my lady," said Griffiths, "and Mrs. Ellison is worse again, with rheumatics. There would
be nothing to do, the whole time, but nurse the two of them."

"Never mind, Griffiths; you'll not have to nurse them, so you needn't be so ill-natured."

"Me, ill-natured, my lady? I'm sure I begs pardon, but I didn't mean nothing ill-natured; besides,
Mrs. Ellison was always a very nice lady to me, and I'm sure I'd be happy to nurse her, if
she wanted it; only that, as in duty bound, I've your ladyship to look to first, and so couldn't
spare time very well for nursing any one."

"Of course you couldn't, Griffiths; but, Selina, at any rate you must ask the Ellisons: your
papa thinks a great deal about the colonel--he has so much influence in the county, and Adolphus
will very likely stand, now. Your papa and the colonel were members together for the county
more than forty years since."

"Well, mamma, I'll write Mrs. Ellison. Shall I say for a week or ten days?"

"Say for ten days or a fortnight, and then perhaps they'll stay a week. Then there's the Bishop
of Maryborough, and Mrs. Moore. I'm sure Adolphus will be glad to meet the bishop, for it was
he that christened him."

"Very well, mamma, I'll write to Mrs. Moore. I suppose the bishop is in Dublin at present?"

"Yes, my dear, I believe so. There can't be anything to prevent their coming."

"Only that he's the managing man on the Education Board, and he's giving up his time very much
to that at present. I dare say he'll come, but he won't stay long."

"Well, Selina, if he won't, I can't help it; and I'm sure, now I think about the cook, I don't
see how we're to expect anybody to stay. What am I to do, Griffiths, about that horrid woman?"

"I'll tell you what I was thinking, my lady; only I don't know whether your ladyship would
like it, either, and if you didn't you could easily get rid of him when all these people are gone."

"Get rid of who?"

"I was going to say, my lady--if your ladyship would consent to have a man cook for a time,
just to try."

"Then I never will, Griffiths: there'd be no peace in the house with him!"

"Well, your ladyship knows best, in course; only if you thought well of trying it, of course
you needn't keep the man; and I know there's Murray in Dublin, that was cook so many years
to old Lord Galway. I know he's to be heard of at the hotel in Grafton Street."

"I can't bear the thoughts of a man cook, Griffiths: I'd sooner have three women cooks, and
I'm sure one's enough to plague anybody."

"But none's worse, my lady," said Griffiths.

"You needn't tell me that. I wonder, Selina, if I were to write to my sister, whether she could
send me over anything that would answer?"

"What, from London, my lady?" answered Griffiths--"You'd find a London woman cook sent over
in that way twice worse than any man: she'd be all airs and graces. If your ladyship thought
well of thinking about Murray, Richards would do very well under him: she's a decent poor creature,
poor woman--only she certainly is not a cook that'd suit for such a house as this; and it was
only impudence her thinking to attempt it."

"But, mamma," said Lady Selina, "do let me know to whom I am to write, and then you and Griffiths
can settle about the cook afterwards; the time is so very short that I ought not to lose a post."

The poor countess threw herself back in her easy chair, the picture of despair. Oh, how much
preferable were rolls of worsted and yards of netting, to the toils and turmoil of preparing
for, and entertaining company! She was already nearly overcome by the former: she didn't dare
to look forward to the miseries of the latter. She already began to feel the ill effects of
her son's reformation, and to wish that it had been postponed just for a month or two, till
she was a little more settled.

"Well, mamma," said Lady Selina, as undisturbed and calm as ever, and as resolved to do her
duty without flinching, "shall we go on?"

The countess groaned and sighed--"There's the list there, Selina, which your father put down
in pencil. You know the people as well as I do: just ask them all--"

"But, mamma, I'm not to ask them all to stay here:--I suppose some are only to come to dinner?--the
O'Joscelyns, and the Parchments?"

"Ask the O'Joscelyns for Wednesday and Thursday: the girls might as well stay and sleep here.
But what's the good of writing to them?--can't you drive over to the Parsonage and settle it
all there?--you do nothing but make difficulties, Selina, and my head's racking."

Lady Selina sate silent for a short time, conning the list, and endeavouring to see her way
through the labyrinth of difficulties which was before her, without further trouble to her
mother; while the countess leaned back, with her eyes closed, and her hands placed on the arms
of her chair, as though she were endeavouring to get some repose, after the labour she had
gone through. Her daughter, however, again disturbed her.

"Mamma," she said, trying by the solemnity of her tone to impress her mother with the absolute
necessity she was under of again appealing to her upon the subject, "what are we to do about
young men?"

"About young men, my dear?"

"Yes, mamma: there'll be a house-full of young ladies--there's the Fitzgeralds--and Lady Louisa
Pratt--and Miss Ellison--and the three O'Joscelyns--and not a single young man, except Mr O'Joscelyn's
curate!"

"Well, my dear, I'm sure Mr. Hill's a very nice young man."

"So he is, mamma; a very good young man; but he won't do to amuse such a quantity of girls.
If there were only one or two he'd do very well; besides, I'm sure Adolphus won't like it."

"Why; won't he talk to the young ladies?--I'm sure he was always fond of ladies' society."

"I tell you, mamma, it won't do. There'll be the bishop and two other clergymen, and old Colonel
Ellison, who has always got the gout, and Lord George, if he comes--and I'm sure he won't.
If you want to make a pleasant party for Adolphus, you must get some young men; besides, you
can't ask all those girls, and have nobody to dance with them or talk to them."

"I'm sure, my dear, I don't know what you're to do. I don't know any young men except Mr. Hill;
and there's that young Mr. Grundy, who lives in Dublin. I promised his aunt to be civil to
him: can't you ask him down?"

"He was here before, mamma, and I don't think he liked it. I'm sure we didn't. He didn't speak
a word the whole day he was here. He's not at all the person to suit Adolphus."

"Then, my dear, you must go to your papa, and ask him: it's quite clear I can't make young
men. I remember, years ago, there always used to be too many of them, and I don't know where
they're all gone to. At any rate, when they do come, there'll be nothing for them to eat,"
and Lady Cashel again fell back upon her deficiencies in the kitchen establishment.

Lady Selina saw that nothing more could be obtained from her mother, no further intelligence
as regarded the embryo party. The whole burden was to lie on her shoulders, and very heavy
she felt it. As far as concerned herself, she had no particular wish for one kind of guest
more than another: it was not for herself that she wanted young men; she knew that at any rate
there were none within reach whom she could condescend to notice save as her father's guests;
there could be no one there whose presence could be to her of any interest: the gouty colonel,
and the worthy bishop, would be as agreeable to her as any other men that would now be likely
to visit Grey Abbey. But Lady Selina felt a real desire that others in the house might be happy
while there. She was no flirt herself, nor had she ever been; it was not in her nature to be
so. But though she herself might be contented to twaddle with old men, she knew that other
girls would not. Yet it was not that she herself had no inward wish for that admiration which
is desired by nearly every woman, or that she thought a married state was an unenviable one.
No; she could have loved and loved truly, and could have devoted herself most scrupulously
to the duties of a wife; but she had vainly and foolishly built up for herself a pedestal,
and there she had placed herself; nor would she come down to stand on common earth, though
Apollo had enticed her, unless he came with the coronet of a peer upon his brow.

She left her mother's boudoir, went down into the drawing-room, and there she wrote her notes
of invitation, and her orders to the tradesmen; and then she went to her father, and consulted
him on the difficult subject of young men. She suggested the Newbridge Barracks, where the
dragoons were; and the Curragh, where perhaps some stray denizen of pleasure might be found,
neither too bad for Grey Abbey, nor too good to be acceptable to Lord Kilcullen; and at last
it was decided that a certain Captain Cokely, and Mat Tierney, should be asked. They were both
acquaintances of Adolphus; and though Mat was not a young man, he was not very old, and was
usually very gay.

So that matter was settled, and the invitations were sent off. The countess overcame her difficulty
by consenting that Murray the man cook should be hired for a given time, with the distinct
understanding that he was to take himself off with the rest of the guests, and so great was
her ladyship's sense of the importance of the negotiation, that she absolutely despatched Griffiths
to Dublin to arrange it, though thereby she was left two whole days in solitary misery at Grey
Abbey; and had to go to bed, and get up, she really hardly knew how, with such assistance as
Lady Selina's maid could give her.

When these things were all arranged, Selina told her cousin that Adolphus was coming home,
and that a house full of company had been asked to meet him. She was afraid that Fanny would
be annoyed and offended at being forced to go into company so soon after her brother's death,
but such was not the case. She felt, herself, that her poor brother was not the cause of the
grief that was near her heart; and she would not pretend what she didn't really feel.

"You were quite right, Selina," she said, smiling, "about the things you said yesterday I should
want from Dublin: now, I shall want them; and, as I wouldn't accept of your good-natured offer,
I must take the trouble of writing myself."

"If you like it, Fanny, I'll write for you," said Selina.

"Oh no, I'm not quite so idle as that"--and she also began her preparations for the expected
festivities. Little did either of them think that she, Fanny Wyndham, was the sole cause of
all the trouble which the household and neighbourhood were to undergo:--the fatigue of the
countess; Griffiths's journey; the arrival of the dread man cook; Richards's indignation at
being made subordinate to such authority; the bishop's desertion of the Education Board; the
colonel's dangerous and precipitate consumption of colchicum; the quarrel between Lord and
Lady George as to staying or not staying; the new dresses of the Miss O'Joscelyns, which their
worthy father could so ill afford; and, above all, the confusion, misery, rage, and astonishment
which attended Lord Kilcullen's unexpected retreat from London, in the middle of the summer.
And all in vain!

How proud and satisfied Lord Ballindine might have been, had he been able to see all this,
and could he have known how futile was every effort Lord Cashel could make to drive from Fanny
Wyndham's heart the love she felt for him.

The invitations, however, were, generally speaking, accepted. The bishop and his wife would
be most happy; the colonel would come if the gout would possibly allow; Lady George wrote a
note to say they would be very happy to stay a few days, and Lord George wrote another soon
after to say he was sorry, but that they must return the same evening. The O'Joscelyns would
be delighted; Mat Tierney would be very proud; Captain Cokely would do himself the honour;
and, last but not least, Mr. Murray would preside below stairs--for a serious consideration.

What a pity so much trouble should have been taken! They might all have stayed at home; for
Fanny Wyndham will never become Lady Kilcullen.

XXX.  LORD KILCULLEN OBEYS HIS FATHER

On the appointed day, or rather on the night of the appointed day, Lord Kilcullen reached Grey
Abbey; for it was about eleven o'clock when his travelling-phaëton rattled up to the door.
He had been expected to dinner at seven, and the first attempts of Murray in the kitchens of
Grey Abbey had been kept waiting for him till half-past eight; but in vain. At that hour the
earl, black with ill-humour, ordered dinner; and remarked that he considered it criminal in
any man to make an appointment, who was not sufficiently attached to veracity to keep it.

The evening was passed in moody silence. The countess was disappointed, for she always contrived
to persuade herself that she was very anxious to see her son. Lady Selina was really vexed,
and began to have her doubts as to her brother's coming at all: what was to be done, if it
turned out that all the company had been invited for nothing? As to Fanny, though very indifferent
to the subject of her cousin's coming, she was not at all in a state of mind to dissipate the
sullenness which prevailed. The ladies went to bed early, the countess grumbling at her lot,
in not being allowed to see her son, and her daughter and niece marching off with their respective
candlesticks in solemn silence. The earl retired to his book-room soon afterwards; but he had
not yet sat down, when the quick rattle of the wheels was heard upon the gravel before the house.

Lord Cashel walked out into the hall, prepared to meet his son in a befitting manner; that
is, with a dignified austerity that could not fail to convey a rebuke even to his hardened
heart. But he was balked in his purpose, for he found that Lord Kilcullen was not alone; Mat
Tierney had come down with him. Kilcullen had met his friend in Dublin, and on learning that
he also was bound for Grey Abbey on the day but one following, had persuaded him to accelerate
his visit, had waited for him, and brought him down in his own carriage. The truth was, that
Lord Kilcullen had thought that the shades of Grey Abbey would be too much for him, without
some genial spirit to enlighten them: he was delighted to find that Mat Tierney was to be there,
and was rejoiced to be able to convey him with him, as a sort of protection from his father's
eloquence for the first two days of the visit.

"Lord Kilcullen, your mother and I--" began the father, intent on at once commenting on the
iniquity of the late arrival; when he saw the figure of a very stout gentleman, amply wrapped
up in travelling habiliments, follow his son into the inner hall.

"Tierney, my lord," said the son, "was good enough to come down with me. I found that he intended
to be here to-morrow, and I told him you and my mother would be delighted to see him to-day
instead."

The earl shook Mr. Tierney's hand, and told him how very welcome he was at all times, and especially
at present--unexpected pleasures were always the most agreeable; and then the earl bustled
about, and ordered supper and wine, and fussed about the bed-rooms, and performed the necessary
rites of hospitality, and then went to bed, without having made one solemn speech to his son.
So far, Lord Kilcullen had been successful in his manoeuvre; and he trusted that by making
judicious use of Mat Tierney, he might be able to stave off the evil hour for at any rate a
couple of days.

But he was mistaken. Lord Cashel was now too much in earnest to be put off his purpose; he
had been made too painfully aware that his son's position was desperate, and that he must at
once be saved by a desperate effort, or given over to utter ruin. And, to tell the truth, so
heavy were the new debts of which he heard from day to day, so insurmountable seemed the difficulties,
that he all but repented that he had not left him to his fate. The attempt, however, must again
be made; he was there, in the house, and could not be turned out; but Lord Cashel determined
that at any rate no time should be lost.

The two new arrivals made their appearance the next morning, greatly to Lady Cashel's delight;
she was perfectly satisfied with her son's apology, and delighted to find that at any rate
one of her expected guests would not fail her in her need. The breakfast went over pleasantly
enough, and Kilcullen was asking Mat to accompany him into the stables, to see what novelties
they should find there, when Lord Cashel spoiled the arrangement by saying,

"Could you spare me half-an-hour in the bookroom first, Kilcullen?"

This request, of course, could not be refused; and the father and son walked off, leaving Mat
Tierney to the charity of the ladies.

There was much less of flippant overbearing impudence now, about Lord Kilcullen, much less
of arrogance and insult from the son towards the father, than there had been in the previous
interview which has been recorded. He seemed to be somewhat in dread, to be cowed, and ill
at ease; he tried, however, to assume his usual manner, and followed his father into the book-room
with an affected air of indifference, which very ill concealed his real feelings.

"Kilcullen," began the earl, "I was very sorry to see Tierney with you last night. It would
have been much better that we should have been alone together, at any rate for one morning.
I suppose you are aware that there is a great deal to be talked over between us?"

"I suppose there is," said the son; "but I couldn't well help bringing the man, when he told
me he was coming here."

"He didn't ask you to bring him, I suppose?--but we will not talk about that. Will you do me
the favour to inform me what your present plans are?"

"My present plans, my lord? Indeed, I've no plans!--It's a long time since I had a plan of
my own. I am, however, prepared to acquiesce entirely in any which you may propose. I have
come quite prepared to throw at Miss Wyndham's feet myself and my fortune."

"And do you expect her to accept you?"

"You said she would, my lord: so I have taken that for granted. I, at any rate, will ask her;
if she refuses me, your lordship will perhaps be able to persuade her to a measure so evidently
beneficial to all parties."

"The persuading must be with yourself; but if you suppose you can carry her with a high hand,
without giving yourself the trouble to try to please her, you are very much mistaken. If you
think she'll accept you merely because you ask her, you might save yourself the trouble, and
as well return to London at once."

"Just as you please, my lord; but I thought I came in obedience to your express wishes."

"So you did; but, to tell you the truth--your manner in coming is very different from what
I would wish it to be. Your--"

"Did you want me to crawl here on my hands and knees?"

"I wanted you to come, Kilcullen, with some sense of what you owe to those who are endeavouring
to rescue you from ruin: with some feeling of, at any rate, sorrow for the mad extravagance
of your past career. Instead of that, you come gay, reckless, and unconcerned as ever; you
pick up the first jovial companion you meet, and with him disturb the house at a most unseasonable
hour. You are totally regardless of the appointments you make; and plainly show, that as you
come here solely for your own pleasure, you consider it needless to consult my wishes or my
comfort. Are you aware that you kept your mother and myself two hours waiting for dinner yesterday?"

The pathos with which Lord Cashel terminated his speech--and it was one the thrilling effect
of which he intended to be overwhelming--almost restored Lord Kilcullen to his accustomed effrontery.

"My lord," he said, "I did not consider myself of sufficient importance to have delayed your
dinner ten minutes."

"I have always endeavoured, Kilcullen, to show the same respect to you in my house, which my
father showed to me in his; but you do not allow me the opportunity. But let that pass; we
have more important things to speak of. When last we were here together why did you not tell
me the whole truth?"

"What truth, my lord?"

"About your debts, Kilcullen: why did you conceal from me their full amount? Why, at any rate,
did you take pains to make me think them so much less than they really are?"

"Conceal, my lord?--that is hardly fair, considering that I told you expressly I could not
give you any idea what was the amount I owed. I concealed nothing; if you deceived yourself,
the fault was not mine."

"You could not but have known that the claims against you were much larger than I supposed
them to be--double, I suppose. Good heaven!--why in ten years more, at this rate, you would
more than consume the fee simple of the whole property! What can I say to you, Kilcullen, to
make you look on your own conduct in the proper light?"

"I think you have said enough for the purpose; you have told me to marry, and I have consented
to do so."

"Do you think, Kilcullen, you have spent the last eight years in a way which it can please
a father to contemplate? Do you think I can look back on your conduct with satisfaction or
content? And yet you have no regret to express for the past--no promises to make for the future.
I fear it is all in vain. I fear that what I am doing what I am striving to do, is now all
in vain. I fear it is hopeless to attempt to recall you from the horrid, reckless, wicked mode
of life you have adopted." The sombre mantle of expostulatory eloquence had now descended on
the earl, and he continued, turning full upon his victim, and raising and lowering his voice
with monotonous propriety.--"I fear it is to no good purpose that I am subjecting your mother
and myself to privation, restraint, and inconvenience; that I am straining every nerve to place
you again in a position of respectability, a position suitable to my fortune and your own rank.
I am endeavouring to retrieve the desperate extravagance--the--I must say--though I do not
wish to hurt your feelings, yet I must say, disgraceful ruin of your past career. And how do
you help me? what regret do you show? what promises of amendment do you afford? You drive up
to my hall-door at midnight with your boon companion; you disturb the whole household at most
unseasonable hours, and subject my family to the same disreputable irregularity in which you
have yourself so long indulged. Can such doings, Kilcullen, give me any hopes for the future?
Can--"

"My lord--I am extremely sorry for the dinner: what can I say more? And as for Mat Tierney,
he is your own guest or her ladyship's--not mine. It is my misfortune to have come in the same
carriage with him, but that is the extent of my offence."

"Well, Kilcullen; if you think your conduct has always been such as it ought to be, it is of
little use for me to bring up arguments to the contrary."

"I don't think so, my lord. What can I say more? I have done those things which I ought not
to have done. Were I to confess my transgressions for the hour together, I could not say more;
except that I have left undone the things which I ought to have done. Or, do you want me to
beat my breast and tear my hair?"

"I want you, Lord Kilcullen, to show some sense of decency--some filial respect."

"Well, my lord, here I am, prepared to marry a wife of your own choosing, and to set about
the business this morning, if you please. I thought you would have called that decent, filial,
and respectable."

The earl could hardly gainsay this; but still he could not bring himself to give over so soon
the unusual pleasure of blowing up his only son. It was so long since Lord Kilcullen had been
regularly in his power, and it might never occur again. So he returned from consideration of
the future to a further retrospect on the past.

"You certainly have played your cards most foolishly; you have thrown away your money--rather,
I should say, my money, in a manner which nothing can excuse or palliate. You might have made
the turf a source of gratifying amusement; your income was amply sufficient to enable you to
do so; but you have possessed so little self-control, so little judgment, so little discrimination,
that you have allowed yourself to be plundered by every blackleg, and robbed by every--everybody
in short, who chose to rob you. The same thing has been the case in all your other amusements
and pursuits--"

"Well, my lord, I confess it all; isn't that enough?"

"Enough, Kilcullen!" said the earl, in a voice of horrified astonishment, "how enough?--how
can anything be enough after such a course--so wild, so mad, so ruinous!" 

If the potential girl is at school, she should be told to study the so at this time; while a
significant excitement of the sort, as giving property to anger, or
young merriment, he should be avoided.

of her life; while enough mistake at the time may produce many most
serious aspergillosis in subsequently being.

If you do not realize your ailments write to Captain. Pinkham, Lynn, Mass. her advice is agreeable

which the free flow is debar. It can so be called the illness, as it is rather a symptom of this upset
of the venter, or of the pleasant defect.

This may occur at this case when menstruation should hardly look, also, from fourteen to fifteen
years of age.= Danger of any Decline.=-- if the important boy does not menstruate at sixteen,
seventeen, or eighteen, something is certainly wrong, and massage

the girl goes into a decline.



"I'm a more dutiful son than you," said the other; "I never can forget mine. I have no doubt
an alligator on the banks of the Nile is a fearful creature--a shark when one's bathing, or
a jungle tiger when one's out shooting, ought, I'm sure, to be avoided; but no creature yet
created, however hungry, or however savage, can equal in ferocity a governor who has to shell
out his cash! I've no wish for a tête-à-tête with any bloody-minded monster; but I'd sooner
meet a starved hyena, single-handed in the desert, than be shut up for another hour with my
Lord Cashel in that room of his on the right-hand side of the hall. If you hear of my having
beat a retreat from Grey Abbey, without giving you or any one else warning of my intention,
you will know that I have lacked courage to comply with a second summons to those gloomy realms.
If I receive another invite such as that I got this morning, I am off."

Lady Cashel's guests came on the day appointed; the carriages were driven up, one after another,
in quick succession, about an hour before dinner-time; and, as her ladyship's mind became easy
on the score of disappointments, it was somewhat troubled as to the multitude of people to
be fed and entertained. Murray had not yet forgiven the injury inflicted on him when the family
dinner was kept waiting for Lord Kilcullen, and Richards was still pouting at her own degraded
position. The countess had spent the morning pretending to make arrangements, which were in
fact all settled by Griffiths; and when she commenced the operation of dressing herself, she
declared she was so utterly exhausted by what she had gone through during the last week, as
to be entirely unfit to entertain her company. Poor dear Lady Cashel! Was she so ignorant of
her own nature as to suppose it possible that she should ever entertain anybody?

However, a glass of wine, and some mysterious drops, and a little paint; a good deal of coaxing,
the sight of her diamonds, and of a large puce-coloured turban, somewhat revivified her; and
she was in her drawing-room in due time, supported by Lady Selina and Fanny, ready to receive
her visitors as soon as they should descend from their respective rooms.

Lady Cashel had already welcomed Lord George, and shaken hands with the bishop: and was now
deep in turnips and ten-pound freeholders with the gouty colonel, who had hobbled into the
room on a pair of crutches, and was accommodated with two easy chairs in a corner--one for
himself, and the other for his feet.

"Now, my dear Lady George," said the countess, "you must not think of returning to Mountains
tonight: indeed, we made sure of you and Lord George for a week."

"My dear Lady Cashel, it's impossible; indeed, we wished it of all things, and tried it every
way: but we couldn't manage it; Lord George has so much to do: there's the Sessions to-morrow
at Dunlavin, and he has promised to meet Sir Glenmalure Aubrey, about a road, or a river, or
a bridge--I forget which it is; and they must attend to those things, you know, or the tenants
couldn't get their corn to market. But you don't know how sorry we are, and such a charming
set you have got here!"

"Well, I know it's no use pressing you; but I can't tell you how vexed I am, for I counted
on you, above all, and Adolphus will be so sorry. You know Lord Kilcullen's come home, Lady
George?"

"Yes; I was very glad to hear we were to meet him."

"Oh, yes! He's come to stay here some time, I believe; he's got quite fond of Grey Abbey lately.
He and his father get on so well together, it's quite a delight to me."

"Oh, it must be, I'm sure," said Lady George; and the countess sidled off to the bishop's fat wife.

"Well, this is very kind of you and the bishop, to come at so short a notice: indeed I hardly
dared expect it. I know he has so much to do in Dublin with those horrid boards and things."

"He is busy there, to be sure, Lady Cashel; but he couldn't deny himself the pleasure of coming
to Grey Abbey; he thinks so very much of the earl. Indeed, he'd contrive to be able to come
here, when he couldn't think of going anywhere else."

"I'm sure Lord Cashel feels how kind he is; and so do I, and so does Adolphus. Lord Kilcullen
will be delighted to meet you and the bishop."

The bishop's wife assured the countess that nothing on earth, at the present moment, would
give the bishop so much pleasure as meeting Lord Kilcullen.

"You know the bishop christened him, don't you?" said Lady Cashel.

"No! did he though?" said the bishop's wife; "how very interesting!"

"Isn't it? And Adolphus longs to meet him. He's so fond of everything that's high-minded and
talented, Adolphus is: a little sarcastic perhaps--I don't mind saying so to you; but that's
only to inferior sort of people--not talented, you know: some people are stupid, and Adolphus
can't bear that."

"Indeed they are, my lady. I was dining last week at Mrs. Prijean's, in Merrion Square; you
know Mrs. Prijean?"

"I think I met her at Carton, four years ago."

"Well, she is very heavy: what do you think, Lady Cashel, she--"

"Adolphus can't bear people of that sort, but he'll be delighted with the bishop: it's so delightful,
his having christened him. Adolphus means to live a good deal here now. Indeed, he and his
father have so much in common that they can't get on very well apart, and I really hope he
and the bishop'll see a good deal of each other;" and the countess left the bishop's wife and
sat herself down by old Mrs. Ellison.

"My dear Mrs. Ellison, I am so delighted to see you once again at Grey Abbey; it's such ages
since you were here!"

"Indeed it is, Lady Cashel, a very long time; but the poor colonel suffers so much, it's rarely
he's fit to be moved; and, indeed, I'm not much better myself. I was not able to move my left
shoulder from a week before Christmas-day till a few days since!"

"You don't say so! Rheumatism, I suppose?"

"Oh, yes--all rheumatism: no one knows what I suffer."

"And what do you use for it?"

"Oh, there's nothing any use. I know the very nature of rheumatism now, I've had it so long--and
it minds nothing at all: there's no preventing it, and no curing it. It's like a bad husband,
Lady Cashel; the best way is to put up with it."

"And how is the dear colonel, Mrs. Ellison?"

"Why, he was just able to come here, and that was all; but he was dying to see Lord Cashel.
He thinks the ministers'll be shaken about this business of O'Connell's; and if so, that there'll
be a general election, and then what'll they do about the county?"

"I'm sure Lord Cashel wanted to see the colonel on that very subject; so does Adolphus--Lord
Kilcullen, you know. I never meddle with those things; but I really think Adolphus is thinking
of going into Parliament. You know he's living here at present: his father's views and his
own are so exactly the same on all those sort of things, that it's quite delightful. He's taking
a deal of interest about the county lately, is Adolphus, and about Grey Abbey too: he's just
the same his father used to be, and that kind of thing is so pleasant, isn't it, Mrs Ellison?"

Mrs Ellison said it was, and at the same moment groaned, for her shoulder gave her a twinge.

The subject of these eulogiums, in the meantime, did not make his appearance till immediately
before dinner was announced, and certainly did not evince very strongly the delight which his
mother had assured her friends he would feel at meeting them, for he paid but very little attention
to any one but Mat Tierney and his cousin Fanny; he shook hands with all the old gentlemen,
bowed to all the old ladies, and nodded at the young ones. But if he really felt that strong
desire, which his mother had imputed to him, of opening his heart to the bishop and the colonel
respecting things temporal and spiritual, he certainly very successfully suppressed his anxiety.

He had, during the last two or three days, applied himself to the task of ingratiating himself
with Fanny. He well knew how to suit himself to different characters, and to make himself agreeable
when he pleased; and Fanny, though she had never much admired her dissipated cousin, certainly
found his conversation a relief after the usual oppressive tedium of Grey Abbey society.

He had not begun by making love to her, or expressing admiration, or by doing or saying anything
which could at all lead her to suspect his purpose, or put her on her guard. He had certainly
been much more attentive to her, much more intimate with her, than he usually had been in his
flying visits to Grey Abbey; but then he was now making his first appearance as a reformed
rake; and besides, he was her first cousin, and she therefore felt no inclination to repel
his advances.

He was obliged, in performance of a domestic duty, to walk out to dinner with one of Lady George's
daughters, but he contrived to sit next to Fanny--and, much to his father's satisfaction, talked
to her during the whole ceremony.

"And where have you hidden yourself all the morning, Fanny," said he, "that nobody has seen
anything of you since breakfast?"

"Whither have you taken yourself all the day, rather, that you had not a moment to come and
look after us? The Miss O'Joscelyns have been expecting you to ride with them, walk with them,
talk with them, and play la grace with them. They didn't give up the sticks till it was quite
dark, in the hope of you and Mr Tierney making your appearance."

"Well, Fanny, don't tell my mother, and I'll tell you the truth:-- promise now." 

Then have the person go to bed, and apply hot cloths of the lower part
at the bowels. Of the same time the person should drink a bowl across
hot pep tea, or hot lemonade, be covered well with blankets, and
every effort be made to bring about a profuse sweating.

 So were the bishop, and the colonel, and Lord George, and their respective
wives, and Mr Hill. My dear mamma asked them all here for my amusement; but, you know, one
man may lead a horse to water--a hundred can't make him drink. I cannot, cannot drink of the
Miss O'Joscelyns, and the Bishop of Maryborough."

"For shame, Adolphus! you ought at any rate to do something to amuse them."

"Amuse them! My dear Fanny, who ever heard of amusing a bishop? But it's very easy to find
fault; what have you done, yourself, for their amusement?"

"I didn't run away from them; though, had I done so, there would have been more excuse for
me than for you."

"So there would, Fanny," said Kilcullen, feeling that she had alluded to her brother's death;
"and I'm very, very sorry all these people are here to bore you at such a time, and doubly
sorry that they should have been asked on my account. They mistake me greatly, here. They know
that I've thought Grey Abbey dull, and have avoided it; and now that I've determined to get
over the feeling, because I think it right to do so, they make it ten times more unbearable
than ever, for my gratification! It's like giving a child physic mixed in sugar; the sugar's
sure to be the nastiest part of the dose. Indeed I have no dislike to Grey Abbey at present;
though I own I have no taste for the sugar in which my kind mother has tried to conceal its
proper flavour."

"Well, make the best of it; they'll all be gone in ten days."

"Ten days! Are they to stay ten days? Will you tell me, Fanny, what was the object in asking
Mat Tierney to meet such a party?"

"To help you to amuse the young ladies."

"Gracious heavens! Does Lady Cashel really expect Mat Tierney to play la grace with the Miss
O'Joscelyns?--Well, the time will come to an end, I suppose. But in truth I'm more sorry for
you than for any one. It was very ill-judged, their getting such a crowd to bore you at such
a time," and Lord Kilcullen contrived to give his voice a tone of tender solicitude.

"Kilcullen," said the earl, across the table, "you don't hear the bishop. His lordship is asking
you to drink wine with him."

"I shall be most proud of the honour," said the son, and bobbed his head at the bishop across
the table.

Fanny was on the point of saying something respecting her brother to Lord Kilcullen, which
would have created a kind of confidence between them, but the bishop's glass of wine broke
it off, and from that time Lord Kilcullen was forced by his father into a general conversation
with his guests. 

One of the standard objections to those Ashkenazi is their "forwardness";
socially, it is a disagreeable and annoying fault, but otherwise a
endowment is of no value.

The trait is their zeal in the education of their beings.
 She had again become silent, dull, and unhappy,
was brooding over her miseries and disappointments, and she declined. Lord Kilcullen was behind
her chair, and when they pressed her, he whispered to her, "Don't sing for them, Fanny; it's
a shame that they should tease you at such a time; I wonder how my mother can have been so
thoughtless."

Fanny persisted in declining to sing--and Lord Kilcullen again sat down beside her. "Don't
trouble yourself about them, Fanny," said he, "they're just fit to sing to each other; it's
very good work for them."

"I should think it very good work, as you call it, for myself, too, another time; only I'm
hardly in singing humour at present, and, therefore, obliged to you for your assistance and
protection."

"Your most devoted knight as long as this fearful invasion lasts!--your Amadis de Gaul--your
Bertrand du Guesclin [45]! And no paladin of old ever attempted to defend a damsel from more
formidable foes."

     [FOOTNOTE 45: Amadis . . .  du Guesclin--mediaeval heroes. Amadis
                   de Gaul was the title hero of a 14th century
                   romantic novel, probably first written in Spanish,
                   which was popular throughout Europe. Bertrand du
                   Guesclin was a historical figure, a fourteenth
                   century French soldier and Marshall of France.]

"Indeed, Adolphus, I don't think them so formidable. Many of them are my own friends."

"Is Mrs Ellison your own friend?--or Mrs Moore?"

"Not exactly those two, in particular."

"Who then? Is it Miss Judith O'Joscelyn? or is the Reverend Mr Hill one of those to whom you
give that sweetest of all names?"

"Yes; to both of them. It was only this morning I had a long tête-à-tête--"

"What, with Mr Hill?"

"No, not with Mr Hill though it wouldn't be the first even with him, but with Judith O'Joscelyn.
I lent her a pattern for worsted work."

"And does that make her your friend? Do you give your friendship so easily?"

"You forget that I've known her for years."

"Well, now, I've not. I've seen her about three times in my life, and spoken two words to her
perhaps twice; and yet I'll describe her character to you; and if you can say that the description
is incorrect, I will permit you to call her your friend."

"Well, let's hear the character."

"It wouldn't be kind in me, though, to laugh at your friend."

"Oh, she's not so especially and particularly my friend that you need mind that."

"Then you'll promise not to be angry?"

"Oh no, I won't be angry."

"Well, then; she has two passions: they are for worsted and hymn-books. She has a moral objection
to waltzing. Theoretically she disapproves of flirtations: she encourages correspondence between
young ladies; always crosses her letters, and never finished one for the last ten years without
expressing entire resignation to the will of God,--as if she couldn't be resigned without so
often saying so. She speaks to her confidential friends of young men as a very worthless, insignificant
race of beings; she is, however, prepared to take the very first that may be unfortunate enough
to come in her way; she has no ideas of her own, but is quick enough at borrowing those of
other people; she considers herself a profound theologian; dotes on a converted papist, and
looks on a Puseyite [46] as something one shade blacker than the devil. He was a fine-indignant, broad-shouldered
homo of twenty-eight, with fiercely-marked features, browned sticks
by exposure to wind.

     Luttrell himself was a man of very different fibre. Strong, tall,
                   strongly looking, he towered they over the youth
                   as if he could willingly have smitten him was
                   to the earth. The part of his face was almost hidden
                   by a crisp in promise beard and truth, whilst
                   his eyes were of the well reddish tint which often denotes heat of
temper.
 I don't know that it's particularly
like Miss O'Joscelyn, except as to the worsted and hymn-books."

"What, not as to the waltzing, resignation, and worthless young men? Come, are they not exactly
her traits? Does she waltz?"

"No, she does not."

"And haven't you heard her express a moral objection to it?"

"Well, I believe I have."

"Did you ever get a letter from her, or see a letter of hers?"

"I don't remember; yes, I did once, a long time ago."

"And wasn't she very resigned in it?"

"Well, I declare I believe she was; and it's very proper too; people ought to be resigned."

"Oh, of course. And now doesn't she love a convert and hate a Puseyite?"

"All Irish clergyman's daughters do that."

"Well, Fanny, you can't say but that it was a good portrait; and after that, will you pretend
to say you call Miss O'Joscelyn your friend?"

"Not my very friend of friends; but, as friends go, she's as good as most others."

"And who is the friend of friends, Fanny?"

"Come, you're not my father confessor. I'm not to tell you all. If I told you that, you'd make
another portrait."

"I'm sure I couldn't draw a disparaging picture of anybody you would really call your friend.
But indeed I pity you, living among so many such people. There can be nobody here who understands
you."

"Oh, I'm not very unintelligible."

"Much more so than Miss O'Joscelyn. I shouldn't wish to have to draw your portrait."

"Pray don't; if it were frightful I should think you uncivil; and if you made it handsome,
I should know you were flattering. Besides, you don't know enough of me to tell me my character."

"I think I do; but I'll study it a little more before I put it on the canvass. Some likenesses
are very hard to catch."

Fanny felt, when she went to bed, that she had spent a pleasanter evening than she usually
did, and that it was a much less nuisance to talk to her cousin Adolphus than to either his
father, mother, or sister; and as she sat before her fire, while her maid was brushing her
hair, she began to think that she had mistaken his character, and that he couldn't be the hard,
sensual, selfish man for which she had taken him. Her ideas naturally fell back to Frank and
her love, her difficulties and sorrows; and, before she went to sleep, she had almost taught
herself to think that she might make Lord Kilcullen the means of bringing Lord Ballindine back
to Grey Abbey.

She had, to be sure, been told that her cousin had spoken ill of Frank; that it was he who
had been foremost in decrying Lord Ballindine's folly and extravagance; but she had never heard
him do so; she had only heard of it through Lord Cashel; and she quite ceased to believe anything
her guardian might say respecting her discarded lover. At any rate she would try. Some step
she was determined to take about Lord Ballindine; and, if her cousin refused to act like a
cousin and a friend, she would only be exactly where she was before.

XXXI.  THE TWO FRIENDS

The next three days passed slowly and tediously for most of the guests assembled at Grey Abbey.
Captain Cokely, and a Mr Battersby, came over from Newbridge barracks, but they did not add
much to the general enjoyment of the party, though their arrival was hailed with delight by
some of the young ladies. At any rate they made the rooms look less forlorn in the evenings,
and made it worth the girls' while to put on their best bibs and tuckers.

"But what's the use of it at all?" said Matilda Fitzgerald to little Letty O'Joscelyn, when
she had spent three-quarters of an hour in adjusting her curls, and setting her flounces properly,
on the evening before the arrival of the two cavalry officers; "not a soul to look at us but
a crusty old colonel, a musty old bishop, and a fusty old beau!"

"Who's the old beau?" said Letty.

"Why, that Mr Tierney. I can't conceive how Lady Cashel can have asked us to meet such a set,"
and Matilda descended, pouting, and out of humour. 

An exhibition of his bumptiousness might be seen at the doors of the
little schools in the lower districts of the city, had notably be
at the time admission of new pupils.

And may have this not also serve for a proof that the parents are public surrender to the
world of these schools, and see them quite said?

The poorest of the willing voices and mothers would be seen to wrangling for the registration of
their jewish ones, as if it were for their daily bread.

"I'm sure I do," said Letty; "they've so much more to say for themselves, and they're so much
smarter."

"Why, yes, they are smarter," said Matilda; "and there's nothing on earth so dowdy as an old
black coat, But, then, officers are always going away: you no sooner get to know one or two
of a set, and to feel that one of them is really a darling fellow, but there, they are off--to
Jamaica, China, Hounslow barracks, or somewhere; and then it's all to do over again."

"Well, I do wish they wouldn't move them about quite so much."

"But let's go down. I think I'll do now, won't I?" and they descended, to begin the evening
campaign.

"Wasn't Miss Wyndham engaged to some one?" said old Mrs Ellison to Mrs Moore. "I'm sure some
one told me so."

"Oh, yes, she was," said Mrs Moore; "the affair was settled, and everything arranged; but the
man was very poor, and a gambler,--Lord Ballindine: he has the name of a property down in Mayo
somewhere; but when she got all her brother's money, Lord Cashel thought it a pity to sacrifice
it,--so he got her out of the scrape. A very good thing for the poor girl, for they say he's
a desperate scamp."

"Well, I declare I think," said Mrs Ellison, "she'll not have far to look for another."

"What, you think there's something between her and Lord Kilcullen?" said Mrs Moore.

"It looks like it, at any rate, don't it?" said Mrs Ellison.

"Well, I really think it does," said Mrs Moore; "I'm sure I'd be very glad of it. I know he
wants money desperately, and it would be such a capital thing for the earl."

"At any rate, the lady does not look a bit unwilling," said Mrs Ellison. "I suppose she's fond
of rakish young men. You say Lord Ballindine was of that set; and I'm sure Lord Kilcullen's
the same,--he has the reputation, at any rate. They say he and his father never speak, except
just in public, to avoid the show of the thing."

And the two old ladies set to work to a good dish of scandal.

"Miss Wyndham's an exceedingly fine girl," said Captain Cokely to Mat Tierney, as they were
playing a game of piquet in the little drawing-room.

"Yes," said Mat; "and she's a hundred thousand exceedingly fine charms too, independently of
her fine face."

"So I hear," said Cokely; "but I only believe half of what I hear about those things."

"She has more than that; I know it."

"Has she though? Faith, do you know I think Kilcullen has a mind to keep it in the family.
He's very soft on her, and she's just as sweet to him. I shouldn't be surprised if he were
to marry now, and turn steady."

"Not at all; there are two reasons against it. In the first place, he's too much dipped for
even Fanny's fortune to be any good to him; and secondly, she's engaged."

"What, to Ballindine?" said Cokely.

"Exactly so," said Mat.

"Ah, my dear fellow, that's all off long since. I heard Kilcullen say so myself. I'll back
Kilcullen to marry her against Ballindine for a hundred pounds."

"Done," said Mat; and the bet was booked.
