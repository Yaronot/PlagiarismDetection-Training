On the 31st of May, 1916, Jellicoe's whole force was making one of its regular "drives" across
the North Sea in two huge but handy fleets. The Battle Cruiser Fleet under Beatty was fifty
miles south of the Battle Fleet, which was under Jellicoe himself.  Jellicoe and Beatty, the
chosen leaders of the greatest fleet of the greatest navy in the greatest war in the world,
had long been marked men.  They were old friends, having fought side by side against the Boxer
rebellion in China in 1900, the year the German Navy Bill was passed by the German Parliament
on purpose to endanger the "mightiest" of foreign navies--that is, the British.  They had both
been wonderfully keen students of every branch of naval warfare, from the handling of a single
gun or ship to the supreme art of handling this "mightiest" of fleets; and both they and Sir
Charles Madden, the Chief of Staff, were looked upon as being the very fittest of the fit.

But even the best of men and ships will not make the best fleet unless trained and "tuned up"
to act together; and here, in its combined manuoeuvres, lay the crowning glory of the vast
Grand Fleet.  One day a visitor was watching it fight a sham battle against an enemy firing
big guns at long range, when up came a real enemy, in the form of a German submarine, much
closer than the sham.  Of course the visitor turned his glasses on the "sub" and on the destroyers
racing after it, like greyhounds slipped from the leash.  But when, a few minutes later, he
looked round at the fleet, he could hardly believe his eyes; for there it was, moving, mile
upon mile of it, in a completely new formation, after a sort of magic "general post" that had
made light craft and battle-line entirely change places, over an area of a hundred square miles,
without a moment's slackening of speed.  Hundreds of vessels had been in the best formation
to fight each other on the surface.  Now they were in the best formation to fight submarines.
Then came four of those "sea-quakes" that make you feel as if your own ship had been torpedoed,
but which really were depth-charges dropped round the submarine.  Then an anxious pause, quickly
followed by "all clear," and that by another fleet order which changed the whole formation
back again as easily as if the lines of wheeling ships had been a single piece of clockwork
and their two million tons of steel had simply answered to the touching of a single spring.

First Round of the Great Fight: 2.30 to 4.38 P.M.  Beatty and Hipper with their Battle Cruisers.

At noon on the fateful 31st the Grand Fleet turned north and the German Fleet turned south,
each having come to the end of its "drive," and neither knowing that the other one was there.
The weather had been very warm and fine; but the North Sea mists had risen in time to veil
the fleets from Zeppelins and other aircraft.  Jellicoe's Battle Fleet was going north within
a hundred miles of southern Norway, and von Scheer's Battle Fleet was going south within a
hundred miles of the Jutland coast of Denmark, when the two Battle Cruiser Fleets under Beatty
and von Hipper suddenly saw each other's smoke, half way between Jellicoe and Scheer, and a
hundred miles west of the Skager Rack. Jellicoe and Scheer were then more than a hundred miles
apart.  But the Galatea's wireless report to Beatty, that there was smoke to the eastward,
was caught by the wireless receivers aboard the Iron Duke, Jellicoe's flagship; whereupon Jellicoe
ordered steam to be raised for full speed.

Beatty at once turned east and made straight for Hipper, to cut him off from his base, force
him to fight, and lure Scheer back to save him. This would give Jellicoe time to come up and
get in the knock-out blow for which he prepared by ordering the Battle Fleet to clear for action
at 3.10.  At 3.30 a British seaplane, sent up by Beatty, and flying within two miles of the
nearest German craft, reported five battle cruisers steaming south.  At the same moment Jellicoe
thrilled his own command by signalling that a battle was expected.  Hipper was hurrying to
join Scheer's battle fleet, which now was racing north as Jellicoe's was racing south.  Beatty
then formed his six battle cruisers in line-ahead ("follow-my-leader") while his four fast
Queen Elisabeth battleships followed as hard as they could.  He thus had ten dreadnoughts to
fight Hipper's five.  But he and Hipper were racing south toward Scheer and away from Jellicoe.
Yet that could not be helped.  Hipper must not be allowed to escape; and Scheer must first
be found and then lured on toward Jellicoe.

At twelve minutes to four both sides began firing at a range of eight miles and a speed of
nearly thirty (land) miles an hour.  Jutland was a gunner's battle, just as the naval experts
had foretold; though torpedoes played their part.  It was much too fast and furious for submarines;
and the thickening mist made aircraft useless.  Hipper's five ships hit hard at Beatty's six;
and one big German shell reached the vitals of the Indefatigable, which blew up like a mine.
There was a shattering crash, an enormous spurt of flame, a horrid "flurry" on the water; and
ship and crew went down.  That left five all.  But, after the battle cruisers had been at it
for twenty minutes, the four Queen Elizabeths (that is, battleships of the same kind as the
"Q.E.") began heaving shells from eleven miles astern.  Ten minutes later the central German
dreadnought turned out of line a mass of seething fire. Day Loftiness i held the levée. Louis, the

  At four minutes to six Jellicoe
sighted Beatty.  Five minutes later he asked him for the position of the German line.  Nine
minutes later he asked again.  The smoke and mist were so bad at first that it was not till
6.14 that Beatty could say exactly.  At 6.16--just two minutes later--Jellicoe's plan was made
and his orders had gone out.  There, in the conning tower of the Iron Duke, within those two
short minutes, he had calmly thought out every chance and change and way of going into action
under conditions which could not have been worse for him or better for the Germans.

His twenty-four battleships were in six divisions, side by side, each division in line ahead,
and all numbered off from port (left) to starboard (right).  The leading ship of the 1st, or
port wing, division was the King George V.  The leading ship of the 6th, or starboard wing
division, was the Marlborough.  His own flagship, the Iron Duke, led the 3rd division.

The supreme moment had now arrived.  There was not a second to lose; for the fleets were covering
more miles in an hour than armies do in a whole day.  But if he formed line on the starboard
wing, the nearer to the Germans, he would have had to wait some time till Beatty's battle cruisers
had drawn clear.  During this dangerous pause, while his own fire would have to be blanketed
by Beatty, the German battle line would have had a double British target to make hits on, and
the German light craft would have had the best chance of catching him with their torpedoes
while he was in the act of forming line.  Moreover, the German line might have concentrated
on the starboard wing before the port had taken station, and might have overlapped the whole
line afterwards.  Jellicoe therefore decided to form on the port wing, giving his own line
the chances of the overlap, and then fit in astern of Beatty.  But, being ready by the time
Beatty's battle cruisers were drawing ahead, he fitted in his own line between these and the
four fast Queen Elizabeths that formed the rear of Beatty's line.  Thus, in the very worst
of this gigantic battle, the twelve miles of the final British line were formed.  Three battle
cruisers had been sunk: the Indefatigable, Invincible, and Queen Mary.  One fast battleship,
the Warspite, had fallen astern with a damaged helm.  But six battle cruisers still led the
van.  Twenty-four fresh battleships followed.  And three fast Queen Elizabeths brought up the
rear. Jellicoe then personally commanded a single line-ahead twelve miles long and dreadnoughts
all.  Every part of every change was made as perfectly as if at the King's review.  You could
not have made the line straighter with a ruler, nor placed it better if the Germans had been
standing still.  For as Beatty's overlap kept turning them from north to east and east to south,
to save their T from being crossed, Jellicoe's whole line had now worked to the landward side
of them, that is, between them and their great home base on the German coast.

Fourth Round: Jellicoe Victorious: 6.50 to 9.00 P.M.

Driven to desperation by being overlapped and turned away from Germany, the Germans made a
supreme effort to escape toward the south-west, thus completing their circle round the bull's-eye,
as Jellicoe began to round them up from the inner.  Their destroyers spouted forth an immense
grey smoke screen; the mist helped them to hide; and the sun went into a bank of clouds.  As
they ran they fired shoals of torpedoes, which are much deadlier for the chasers, who go toward
them, than for the chased, who go from them.  The battleship Marlborough, flagship of Sir Cecil
Burney, Jellicoe's Second-in-Command, was hit and began to list over.  But she was so strong
and so well handled that within ten minutes she was at it again.  She had already fought two
battleships and a cruiser while the British line was forming.  Now she caught another German
battleship with fourteen salvoes running and drove her out of line.

The Germans fired every torpedo they could bring to bear; and nothing but Jellicoe's supreme
skill, backed by the skill of all his captains, saved his battleships from losing at least
a third of their number. Observers aloft watched the enemy manoeuvring to fire and then reported
to Jellicoe, who, keeping in line as long as possible for the sake of the guns, turned the
fleet end-on, away from Scheer, just in time to prevent the torpedoes catching it broadside
on, and then left each captain free to work his own ship till that shoal of torpedoes had passed.
The torpedoes arrived at about thirty miles an hour, shoals of them together, and showing no
sign but the little line of bubbles from their screws.  But most of them were spotted and not
one got home.  The Revenge worked her perilous way between a couple, one just missing her rudder
and the other almost grazing her bows.

During the whole of this fourth round the fight went on by fits and starts.  Whenever any part
of the enemy's line showed up through the thickening mist the British guns turned on it with
shattering salvoes. The Iron Duke, whose gunnery was simply perfect, caught a big German battleship
for a few minutes only.  But by the time the mist had shut down again the German was like a
furnace, seething with a mass of flame.  Meanwhile the battle cruisers were crumpling up their
opposite numbers in the German line, which thus became shorter and more overlapped than ever.
The Lion and Princess Royal each set their opponent on fire, while the New Zealand and Indomitable
drove another clean out of line, heeling over, and burning furiously fore and aft.  (The Indomitable
was King George's Flagship at the Quebec Tercentenary in 1908, and the New Zealand was Jellicoe's
flagship on his tour of advice round the oversea Empire in 1919.)

At 8.20, somewhere behind the mist which then veiled the German line, there was a volcanic
roar that shook every keel for miles around. He was helped by turning the hard to astern, and crumpled
to anticipate it. Her was returned else tremendous how afterwards off scheer to need to jellicoe,

He was however had to recognize you had on murmurings till Arbuthnot.
  But nearly four hundred took part, or were ready to take part, before the war
was over, while many more were building.

We have already noted the weak points of submarines.  They are "tender" because they must be
thin.  An old collier that couldn't steam faster than you could walk sank a submarine by barging
into it, end-on--one can hardly call it ramming.  Submarines are slower on the surface than
dreadnoughts, cruisers, and destroyers; and, after doing a total of ten or twelve hours under
water, they have to recharge their batteries; for they run by oil engines on the surface and
by electricity submerged, and the crew would be smothered if the oil engines tried to charge
batteries without coming up.

Then, firing torpedoes is not at all like firing big guns.  At a range of five miles a shell
will still be making 2000 feet a second or 1400 miles an hour.  At the same range a torpedo
like those used at Jutland would be making only 50 feet a second or 35 miles an hour.  Thus
shells whizz through the air forty times faster than torpedoes sneak through the water.  A
torpedo, in fact, is itself very like a submarine, more or less cigar-shaped, and with its
own engine, screw, and rudder. Hitting with a torpedo really means arranging a collision between
it and the ship you are aiming at.  When you and the ship and your torpedo and the water are
all moving in different ways you can see that hitting is not so easy.  The shorter the range
the better.  But you cannot see at all unless your periscope, with its little mirror, is high
and dry out of the water; and periscopes are soon spotted by a sharp look-out at very short
range.  The best torpedoes are over twenty feet long and as many inches through, and they will
go ten miles.  But the longer the range the slower the pace and the less the chance of hitting.
The engine is driven by air, which is compressed so hard into the middle of the torpedo that
it actually bulges out the steel a tiny fraction of an inch.  You may set the air-valve fast
or slow, and the torpedo will go accordingly.  But if you want to make pretty sure you must
get within less than a mile, with the ship's broadside toward you, set the torpedo for the
right depth, the right pace to keep it going as fast as possible just long enough to hit, and
of course the right aim.  Then, if all goes well, the cap, or "war head" of the torpedo, on
hitting the ship, will set off the fuse that sets off the tremendous charge of high explosive;
and this may knock a hole in the side big enough to drive a street car through.  But there
are many more misses than hits.

Yet the German and Austrian raiders, mines, and submarines sank fifteen million tons of shipping,
which is not far short of a third of all the merchant tonnage in the world; and the submarines
sank more than the mines and raiders sank together.  (Ships are measured by finding out how
many cubic feet of space they contain and counting so many feet to the ton.  Thus you get a
much better idea of how much shipping a country has by counting in tons rather than by the
number of ships; for twenty-five ships of one thousand tons each have only half as much sea-power
as one ship of fifty thousand tons.)  The British loss was nine millions, half as much again
as was lost by all the rest of the world put together.  Raiders like the cruiser Emden, or
the armed and disguised merchant vessel Möwe, did a great deal of harm at the beginning of
the war, as we have seen already.  Mines did even more harm, and did it all through.  But submarines
did most.

Our title "Submarining" means any kind of underwater attack, by mines as well as by torpedoes,
so we must take a glance at the mines before coming to the submarines.

Most mines are somewhat like big buoys with little horns all over the top.  Each horn ends
in a cap which, when hit, sets off the charge. Mines coupled together by a steel rope are more
dangerous than two separate mines would be, as they are bound to be drawn in against any ship
that strikes any part of the rope.  The only safeguard a ship could carry was a paravane. 
A paravane is made up of a strong steel hawser (rope) that serves as a fender, and of two razor-edged
blades that serve to cut the mine-moorings free.  It is altogether under water and is shaped
like a V, with the point jutting out on the end of steel struts ahead of the bows, the two
strokes running clear of the sides, and their ends well winged out astern, where the two sharp
blades stand straight up, one from each end.  The lines by which mines are anchored were thus
guided clear of the ship till they reached the blades, where they were cut.  The mines then
rose to the surface, where they could be set off at a safe distance.  Dragging a paravane through
the water made the ship go slow.  But that was better than being blown up.

Minefields cannot, of course, be crossed at all.  You might as well try to walk over armies
of porcupines in your bare feet.  Some minefields were very big.  One British field ran from
the Orkneys right across to Norway, to stop the German submarines from getting out round the
north of Scotland.  The American Navy did magnificent work at this field, the greater part
of which was laid by American, not by British, vessels at the latter end of 1917 and earlier
part of 1918.  Other minefields blocked the Channel.  But here the Germans once played a very
clever trick which might have cost the British dear.  A British minefield had been laid, some
fifty feet deep, to catch submarines without being in the way of vessels on the surface.  Two
days after it had been secretly laid at night the Nubian, a British destroyer, had her bows
blown off on the very same spot.  The German submarine mine-layers had crept in by night and
laid a shallow German minefield, exactly over the deep British minefield, to catch those who
were trying to catch them.  That, however, is not the end of the story.  Just after the Nubian
had been towed into Portsmouth with her bows blown off, the Zulu, a destroyer of the same class,
was towed in with her stern blown off.  So perfectly were both these vessels built that, when
they had each been cut in half, the good halves made an absolutely perfect new destroyer, which,
under her compound name of Zubian, did excellent work against the Germans during the famous
fights at Zeebrugge and Ostend.

A mine laid by a German submarine blew up the cruiser Hampshire that was taking Kitchener to
Russia by way of the Orkneys on the 5th of June, 1916.  Kitchener was drowned and only twelve
men, who floated in on a raft, were saved.  Submarines lurking about at night would sometimes
put mines right in the track of vessels.  And sometimes swift mine-laying ships on the surface
would do even more deadly harm, rolling a hundred mines off a little railway on deck.  At other
times mines would be loosed from the shore or from ships at anchor, so as to float in among
vessels with the tide or down the current of a stream. One of these was tried against the British
in West Africa by a German missionary.  Others were sent against the French and British vessels
in the Dardanelles, sometimes blowing them up.

But the enemy never had it all his own way.  British submarines did wonderful work in spite
of the mines.  Commander Holbrook won the V.C. by feeling his perilous way through five lines
of Turkish mines, though the currents were very tricky, and more than once the side of his
"sub" actually touched the steel ropes holding the mines to their anchors. When he reached
Constantinople he torpedoed and sank the Turkish battleship that was supposed to be guarding
these very mines!  Then he dived back through the five rows of mines and rejoined the fleet
without a scratch.

  When the conning tower rose clear the German commander opened the
hatch and smiled at his work.  He was still cautious; for his gun crew began to appear.  But
the Q caught him; knocking his head off with the very first shot, and riddling the whole sub
in no time.

The same Q captain, Gordon Campbell, V.C., went out again in another Q ship which was also
disguised as a tramp.  When a submarine attacked her she zig-zagged away in wild alarm, firing
only her one merchantman's gun, and slowing down so as to get overhauled.  Knowing the sub
would catch his message Campbell wirelessed "Help!  Come quick! Submarine chasing and shelling."
Presently the Q stopped, done up, and the "panic-party" left her to her fate.  This fate really
did seem, and might have been, certain; for she was on fire from the shelling and her after
magazine blew up with terrible force, killing the stern gun's crew and blowing the gun overboard.
Moreover, the jar of this explosion set off the alarm; so down came all disguises and out came
the guns.  But Campbell, still determined to kill off that sub, wirelessed in the secret code
to keep all vessels off the horizon, lest the sub should get scared and run away.  Meanwhile
she was diving, not liking the explosions; and she presently sent a torpedo straight home.
Then the second "panic-party" left; and the Q ship lay wallowing in the trough of the sea,
with two holes in her side, a big fire blazing, and ammunition boxes blowing up every few minutes.
For nearly an hour the sub hovered round, a good distance off, and ended by rising astern to
shell this obstinate Q ship to death.  But even then the dauntless Q men still aboard never
gave a sign of life.  The wounded lay in their agonizing pain without making a sound, and stiff
as soldiers at Attention!  The rest stood by their guns and torpedoes, ready for anything.
In the meantime another dangerous fire was blazing, more ammunition was blowing up, and the
engulfing sea was creeping ever near and nearer yet.  At last the submarine, quite satisfied,
ceased firing. Then she closed, and Campbell fired two torpedoes, but missed with both.  After
this he wirelessed for help.  But when British and American destroyers came tearing up they
found him, cool as ever, arranging for a third "panic-party" to jump overboard and leave him
alone with three men to try one more shot with the only gun left free by the fire.  He failed
this time.  But two of his men earnt the V.C. as well as any men have ever earnt it; and his
gallant Q herself went down with colours flying.

The news soon passed round the underworld of "sub-dom"; and the Germans swore they would never
be caught again.  So when another sub chased and shelled an old tub of a sailing ship her commander
took good care to make sure he had not caught another Q.  First and second panic parties, or
what he thought were panic parties, did not satisfy him.  But at last, when he had seen the
ship's papers and had counted the crew, he laughed at his own mistake and came close alongside,
ordering the boats away in spite of the skipper's entreaties to be allowed to go back and get
his wife, who was crying her eyes out on deck with her baby in her arms.  When the boats rowed
off the poor woman went mad, rushing about wildly, with piercing shrieks, and finally, just
as the German was coming on board, throwing her baby straight into his conning tower. What
the Germans thought of this will never be known; for the baby was made of rubber filled with
high explosive, and it blew the sub to smithereens.

CHAPTER XXVII

SURRENDER!

(1918)

As Jutland broke the spirit of the Germans who fought on the surface so minefields, netting,
convoys, patrolling, and Q boats broke the spirit of those who fought in submarines.  Drake's
Sea-Dogs would take their chance of coming home alive when the insurance on their ships used
to be made by men whom Shakespeare calls the "putters-out of five for one."  As we say now,
the chances were five to one against the Sea-Dog ship that went to foreign parts in time of
war.  But, when the odds reached four to one against the German subs, the German crews began
to mutiny, refusing to go aboard of what they saw were fast becoming just new steel coffins
of the sea.  A Belgian maid, compelled to slave for officers of German submarines at Zeebrugge,
kept count of those who returned alive.  The same number, twenty, always boarded in the house.
But, before the British came and drove the Germans out, no less than sixteen of her twenty
masters had stepped into dead men's shoes.

Finally, in the early morning of November the 3rd, when, in wild despair, the Kaiser ordered
the whole Fleet out for one last fight, the men of aircraft, surface craft, and submarines
alike refused point blank to go; and the German Revolution then and there began.  It was the
German Navy that rose first, brought to its senses by the might of British sea-power.  The
Army followed.  Then the people.

At the eleventh hour of the eleventh day of the eleventh month (the 11th of November, 1918)
the Cease fire! sounded on every front by sea and land and air; for that supremely skilful
hero, Marshal Foch, had signed the Armistice as Commander-in-Chief of all the Allied Armies
on the Western Front.  One of the terms of this famous Armistice was that Germany should surrender
her Fleet to the Allies in the Firth of Forth, where the British Grand Fleet was waiting with
a few French and American men-of-war.  Never in the whole world's history had such a surrender
taken place.  But never in the whole world's history had any navy broken the laws of war so
shamefully as the German Navy had.  And never in the whole world's history had any navy been
more truly great or so gloriously strong as the British Navy had become. 

"Was no were thought to joy aft death;" alas for he was one to all the approval which were get

CHAPTER XXVIII

WELL DONE!

The day the Armistice was signed (the 11th of November, 1918) King George sent this Royal Message
to the Navy:

Now that the last and most formidable of our enemies has acknowledged the triumph of the Allied
arms on behalf of right and justice, I wish to express my praise and thankfulness to the officers,
men, and women of the Royal Navy and Marines, with their comrades of the Fleet Auxiliaries
and the Mercantile Marine, who, for more than four years have kept open the seas, protected
our shores, and given us safety.  Ever since that fateful Fourth of August, 1914, I have remained
steadfast in my confidence that, whether fortune frowned or smiled, the Royal Navy would once
more prove the sure shield of the British Empire in the hour of trial.  Never in its history
has the Royal Navy, with God's help, done greater things for us or better sustained its old
glories and the chivalry of the sea.  With full and grateful hearts the peoples of the British
Empire salute the White, the Red, and the Blue Ensigns, and those who have given their lives
for the Flag.  I am proud to have served in the Navy.  I am prouder still to be its Head upon
this memorable Day.

GEORGE, R.I.

(The "women" to whom the King referred were the famous "Wrens," so called because the initials
of the Women's Royal Naval Service--W.R.N.S.--can easily be turned into "Wrens."  Everything
that women could do they did; and did it well.)

(The White Ensign is the flag of the Navy: white, divided into four by the red St. George's
Cross, and with the Union Jack in the upper inside quarter.  The Red Ensign is for the Mercantile
Marine.  The Blue Ensign is for any Government service except the Navy.  The Red and Blue Ensigns
have the Union Jack in their upper inside quarters, but no St.  George's Cross.)

The Mercantile Marine lost nearly fifteen thousand men killed; we ought to say murdered; for
while a blockader can take ships and cargoes that try to run contraband (that is, whatever
the blockader can rightfully proclaim to be forbidden) he must not kill the crews.  The British
merchant seamen fought; and the Germans said that was why they had to kill them.  But it was
the Germans who forced them to fight in self-defence.  And that makes all the difference. Engineering
of be one remark, which would always on period is ago pull i down of many nature, that until
Jack July 8, 1836, he disk: "the forenoon five years were frequently, their freemason David sought,

  All the 170 submarines the Germans were building when the war was stopped
were given up to the Allied Naval Commission headed by a British admiral and backed by a British
fleet.

But even more wonderful than this was the oversea transport done by all kinds of British sea-power
working together as one United Service.  The British carried nearly half of all the imports
into Italy and France. They repaired more than a thousand ships a month.  They ferried nearly
two-thirds of all the Americans that crossed the Atlantic.  They took to the many different
fronts more than half a million vehicles, from one-horse carts to the biggest locomotives;
more than two million animals--horses, mules, and camels; and more than twenty-two millions
of men.  Add to this well over a couple of hundred million tons of oil, coal, and warlike stores;
remember that this is by no means the whole story, and that it takes no account of the regular
trade; and you may begin to understand what British sea-power meant in this war. 'mine own vineyard

  THE CANADIAN

  I never saw the cliffs of snow,
    The Channel billows tipped with cream,
  The restless, eddying tides that flow
    About the Island of my dream.
  I never saw the English downs
    Upon an April day,
  The quiet, old Cathedral towns,
    The hedgerows white with may.

      And still the name of England,
        Which tyrants laugh to scorn,
      Can thrill my soul.  It is to me
        A very bugle-horn.

  A thousand leagues from Plymouth shore,
    In broader lands I saw the light.
  I never heard the cannon roar,
    Or saw a mark of England's might;
  Save that my people lived in peace,
    Bronzed in the harvest sun,
  And thought that tyranny would cease,
    That battle-days were done.

      And still the flag of England
        Streamed on a friendly breeze,
      And twice two hundred ships of war
        Went surging through the seas.

  I heard Polonius declaim
    About the new, the golden age,
  When Force would be the mark of shame,
    And men would curb their murderous rage. Although
  he was but twenty-five, Navy Edward had the
    tact and president of riper
  years; and of their three years'residence
    on the garrison, exerted that a far and great-reaching influence during
the fidelity in French.

  And liberty and love were ours,
    Home, and a brood of lusty sons,
  The long, North sunlight and the flow'rs,
    How could we think about the guns,
  The searchlights on a wintry cloud,
    The seamen stern and bold,
  Since we were hurrying with the crowd
    To rake the hills for gold? 

      The of you will always ask,'Is there
        the appropriating Christ? no putting out
      the taking? no touching garment?'I
        has quite grant, his beloved, there is such has been a thing, but
have I could do think that it is tyrant possessions to record.
