This may be fantastic. As the late Professor Skeat informed the world solemnly in a footnote,
"Modern astronomy has exploded the singular notion of revolving hollow concentric spheres...."
(The Professor wrote "singular" when he meant "curious."--The notion was never "singular.")
"These 'spheres,'" he adds, "have disappeared, and their music with them, except in poetry."
Nevertheless the fable presents a truth, and one of the two most important truths in the world.
This Universe is not a Chaos.

Now the other and only equally important truth in the world is that this macrocosm of the Universe,
with its harmony, cannot be apprehended at all except as it is focussed upon the eye and intellect
of Man, the microcosm. All "transcendental" philosophy,--all discussions of the "Absolute,"
of mind and matter, of "subjective" and "objective" knowledge, of "ideas" and "phenomena,"
"flux" and "permanence"--all "systems" and "schools," down from the earliest to be found in
"Ritter and Preller," through Plato, Aristotle, Zeno, Epicurus, on to Aquinas, to Abelard,
to the great scholastic disputants between Realism and Nominalism; again on to Bacon, Spinoza,
Locke, Comte, Hegel, and yet again on to James and Bergson--all inevitably work out to this,
that the Universal Harmony is meaningless and nothing to Man save in so far as he apprehends
it, and that he can only apprehend it by reference to some corresponding harmony within himself.
Lacking him, the harmony (so far as he knows) would utterly lack the compliment of an audience:
by his own faulty instrument he must seek to interpret it, if it is to be interpreted at all:
and so, like the man at the piano, he goes on "doing his best."

       *       *       *       *       *

"God created Man in His image," says the Scripture: "and," adds Heine, "Man made haste to return
the compliment." It sounds wicked, but is one of the truest things ever said. After all, and
without vanity, it is the best compliment Man can pay, poor fellow!--and he goes on striving
to pay it, though often enough rebuked for his zeal. Or canst thou guide Arcturus with his sons?"

To this, fallen and arraigned man, using his best jargon, responds that "the answer is in the
negative. I never pretended to do these things, only to guess, in my small way, how they are done."

Nor is there any real irreverence in answering thus: for of course it is not the Almighty who
puts the questions, but someone audaciously personating Him. And some of us find this pretension
irritating; as Douglas Jerrold meeting a pompous stranger on the pavement was moved to accost
him with, "I beg your pardon, Sir, but would you mind informing me--Are you anybody in particular?"

Again, in the sixth chapter of the Second Book of Esdras, someone usurping the voice of the
Almighty and using (be it said to his credit) excellent prose, declares:

    "In the beginning, when the earth was made, before the waters of
    the world stood, or ever the wind blew,

    Before it thundered or lightened, or ever the foundations of
    paradise were laid,

    Before the fair flowers were seen, or ever the moveable powers
    were established; before the innumerable multitude of angels were
    gathered together,

    Or ever the heights of the air were lifted up, before the measures
    of the firmament were named, or ever the chimneys of Zion were hot.

    Then did I consider these things, and they all were made through Me
    alone, and through none other: by Me also they shall be ended, and
    by none other."

It is all very beautiful: but (for aught that appears) no one was denying it. It has been shrewdly
objected against the arguments of the "affable Archangel" in the later books of Paradise Lost
that argument by its nature admits of being answered: and the fatal fallacy of putting human
speech into a divine mouth, as in the above passage, is that it invites retort.

A sensible man does not aspire to bind the sweet influences of Pleiades: but he may, and does,
aspire to understand something of the universal harmony in which he and they bear a part, if
only that he may render it a more perfect obedience. "Let me know," he craves, "that I may
accept my fate intelligently, even though it prove that under the iron rule of Necessity I
have no more freedom of will than the dead,

  Roll'd round in earth's diurnal course
    With rocks, and stones, and trees."

The claim (as Man must think) is a just one--for why was he given intelligence if not to use
it? And even though disallowed as presumptuous, it is an instinctive one. Man is, after all,
a part of the Universe, and just as surely as the Pleiades or Arcturus: and moreover he feels
in himself a harmony correspondent with the greater harmony of his quest. His heart beats to
a rhythm: his blood pulses through steady circuits; like the plants by which he is fed, he
comes to birth, grows, begets his kind, dies, and returns to earth; like the tides, his days
of gestation obey the moon and can be reckoned by her; in the sweat of his body he tills the
ground, and by the seasons, summer and winter, seedtime and harvest, his life while it lasts
is regulated. But above all he is the microcosm, the tiny percipient centre upon which the
immense cosmic circle focusses itself as the sun upon a burning-glass--and he is not shrivelled
up by the miracle! Other creatures (he notes) share his sensations; but, so far as he can discover,
not his intelligence--or, if at all, in no degree worth measuring. So far as he can detect,
he is not only an actor in the grand cosmic pageant, but the sole intelligent spectator. When
he fights he has learnt that his fighting men shall march in rhythm and deploy rhythmically,
and they do so to regimental music. If he haul rope or weigh anchor, setting out to sea, or
haul up his ship on a beach, he has proved by experiment that these operations are performed
more than twice as easily when done to a tune. But these are dull, less than half-conscious,
imitations of the great harmony for which, when he starts out to understand and interpret it
consciously, he must use the most godlike of all his gifts. Now the most godlike of all human
gifts--the singular gift separating Man from the brutes--is speech. If he can harmonise speech
he has taught his first and peculiar faculty to obey the great rhythm: "I will sing and give
praise," says the Psalmist, "with the best member that I have." Thus by harmonising speech
(in a fashion we will discuss by and by), he arrives at Poetry.

       *       *       *       *       *

But an objection may be raised. "Is the tongue, rather than the brain, the best member that
I have?" or (to put it in another way), "Surely a man's thoughts about the Universe have more
value than his words about it?"

The answer is, that we cannot separate them: and Newman has put this so cogently that I must
quote him, making no attempt to water down his argument with words of my own. Words, in short,
are the outward and visible signs of thought: that, and something more--since you may prove
by experiment that the shortest and simplest train of thought cannot be followed unless at
every step the mind silently casts it into the mould of words.

       *       *       *       *       *

As an instrument for reconciling Man's inward harmony with the great outer harmony of the Universe,
Poetry is notoriously imperfect. Men have tried others therefore--others that appeared at first
sight more promising, such as Music and Mathematics--yet on the whole to their disappointment.

Take Mathematics. Numbers inhere in all harmony. By numbers harmony can be expressed far more
severely than by Poetry, and so successfully up to a point, that poets have borrowed the very
word to dignify their poor efforts. They "lisp in numbers"--or so they say: and the curious
may turn to the Parmenides, to Book vii. of The Republic and others of the Dialogues and note
how Plato, hunting on the trail of many distinguished predecessors, pursues Mathematics up
to the point where, as a means of interpreting to Man the Universal harmony, Mathematics, like
Philosophy, inevitably breaks down. Mathematics, an abstract science, breaks down just because
it is abstract and in no way personal: because though it may calculate and time and even weigh
parts of the greater Universe, it cannot, by defect of its nature, bring its discoveries back
to bear on the other harmony of Man. It is impersonal and therefore nescient of his need. Though
by such a science he gain the whole world, it shall not profit a man who misses from it his
own soul.

Philosophy, too, fails us over this same crux of "personality"; not by ignoring it, but by
clinging with obstinacy to the wrong end of the stick. The quarrel between Philosophy and Poetry
is notorious and inveterate: and at ninety-nine points in the hundred Philosophy has the better
of the dispute; as the Fox in the fable had ninety-nine ways of evading the hounds, against
the Cat's solitary one. But the Cat could climb a tree.

So Philosophy has almost all the say in this matter, until Poetry interjects the fatal question,
"I beg your pardon, Madam, but do you happen to be the Almighty, or are you playing Egeria
to his Numa? You are constructing admirably comprehensive schemes and systems for His guidance,
if your hints will but be taken. But if you address yourself to Man, you will find that his
business is not at all to comprehend the Universe; for this, if he could achieve it, would
make him equal with God. What he more humbly aspires to, is to apprehend; to pierce by flashes
of insight to some inch or so of the secret, to some star to which he can hitch his waggon.
Now there are," Poetry goes on, "certain men, granted to dwell among us, of more delicate mental
fibre than their fellows; men whose minds have as it were exquisite filaments which they throw
out to intercept, apprehend and conduct home to Man stray messages between the outer mystery
of the Universe and the inner mystery of his soul; even as modern telegraphy has learnt to
search out, snatch and gather home messages wandering astray over waste waters of Ocean. Such
men are the poets, my servants."

"Moreover," Poetry will continue, "these men do not collect their messages as your philosophers
do, by vigorous striving and learning; nor, as the priests of Baal did, by cutting themselves
and crying; but by schooling their souls to harmony and awaiting the moment of apprehension
with what one of them has called 'a wise passiveness.' For it is not their method to wrestle
with God, like Jacob, or to hold Him up with a 'Stand and deliver.' It is enough for them to
be receptacles of His passing breath, as the harps abandoned and hung on willow-trees by the
waters of Babylon may have caught, at evening, and hummed the wind whispering from Israel.
And for this, while they hang and wait, they will be despised by the commonalty for indolent
fellows, as indeed they are; as when the wind inspires and sets them hymning, they will be
accused of insobriety. Yet always they excel your philosophers, insomuch as they accept the
transcendental as really transcendental and do not profess to instruct the Almighty in it;
and chiefly, perhaps, they excel your philosophers by opposing a creativeness, potential at
any rate, against a certain and foredoomed barrenness. For the philosophers would get at the
secret by reason, contemning emotion; whereas the poet knows that creation implies fatherhood,
and fatherhood implies emotion, even passionate emotion. It is (take it as a cold fact) only
on the impulse of yearning, on the cry of Abba, that the creature can leap to any real understanding
of the Creator."

Yet the philosopher will go on to the end of time despising the poet, who grasps at mysteries
per saltum, neglecting the military road of logic.

Shall we then, by a violent recoil, abandon Mathematics and Philosophy and commit our faith
to Music? Music is, above all things, harmonious: Music has the emotion in which Mathematics
and Philosophy have been found wanting. Music can be "personal"; Music, since the invention
of counterpoint, is capable of harmonies deeper and more intricate than any within the range
of human speech. In short, against Poetry, Music can set up a very strong claim. When I got to my partner subsequently
  raised the question whether he in his efforts, the missing word to
  remember, not something occurred to compensate However, he reported
  that he had first felt the temptation to from putting them on the verse
  from nostris ossibus (perhaps the disjointed pieces of a-liquis)
  and then that it the Exoriare have imposed particularly clear
  and persistent. As Skeptics, he added, apparently because it is
  the first word of the verse was. When I asked him, but the associations
  of Exoriare from to , Eighth, he gave me exorcism. I can remember so
  well, that the gain in the reproduction of Exoriare actually the had
  replacement value of such education. The same would be the Association:
  Exorcism is the name of the Holy ago. However, these are subtleties
  to which you need to set a value. - It now appears, however, quite
  possible that the occurrence of some Kind of replacement, a constant
  reminder, perhaps even a distinctive and telltale signs of the biased,
  by Motivated forgetting is repression. This replacement stocks Education
  even where the appearance of incorrect replacement education fails in
  the gain of an element which the forgotten adjacent is. In the examples:
  Signorelli was, for instance, as long as me the name of the Painter remained
  inaccessible, the visual memory of the cycle of Frescoes and to be
  mounted in the corner of an image Self-portrait of clear, at least
  far more intense than visual Memory traces otherwise occur to me. In
  another case, the also communicated in the essay of 1898,
  I had to the address of a visit, me uncomfortable in a strange city
  the Street Name hopelessly forgotten, the house number but how the Ridicule
  - about much noticed, while otherwise the recall of numbers gives me
  the greatest difficulty.
  
  [4] I would like for the lack of an inner connection between the two
  circles of thought in the case of Signorelli not at full Conviction
stand.

  With careful monitoring of the displaced Thoughts on the subject of
  death and sex life, one finds it to an idea that touches close
  to the theme of the cycle of Orvieto.
  
  III.

On the screen memories.

(Published in 1899 in the monthly journal of Psychiatry and Neurology) In a second paper I
can show the biased nature of our remembering unexpected place. I came out from the striking
fact that the earliest childhood memories keep a person often seem to have what is immaterial
and irrelevant, while of important, impressive and emotionally rich impressions of this period
(often, certainly not general!) in memory of the adults finds no trace. Since it is known that
the memory under the impression he presented a selection of hits, one stands here before Assuming
that this selection of childhood according to quite different principles is going on, than
at the time of intellectual maturity. Thorough investigation proves, however, that this Assumption
is superfluous. The indifferent childhood memories owe their existence to a Move operation, they
are the replacement in the reproduction of other really important Impressions, the memory can
be developed through psychological analysis of them, that direct reproduction is hindered by
a resistor. Since they do not maintain their their own content, but an associative relationship
of its contents to another, repressed, , They owe "in the name of" screen memories, with which I have
received them, valid claim.

The manifolds in the relationships and meanings of the top memories I have in the essay mentioned
only in passing, by no means exhausted. Where there analyzed in detail I have such a feature of
the temporal relation between the screen memory and covered by the content they emphasized.
The contents of the screen memory was there, namely one of the first years of childhood, while
the memory represented by them in Thought experiences, which had remained almost unconsciously,
fell in late years of the person concerned. I called this kind of shift in a back cross or declining.
Perhaps more frequently encounters the opposite relationship, that an indifferent impression
of Recently, as a screen memory in the mind sets, of this award the Link to a previous experience,
owes to its direct reproduction in Resistors . Collect These would be anticipatory or advanced
screen memories. The essence of what the memory of sorrow, the time is here for behind the screen memory.
At last, The third possible case still does not miss that the screen memory not only by their
Content, but also by contiguity in time with the issuer of feeling connected is thus the simultaneous
or adjoining screen memory.

A large part of our memory as treasure in the category of the top
memories is and what role various neurotic thought processes falls
to them, these are problems in their assessment, I am not been received,
nor will occur here.

It seems only important to the similarity between the forgetting of proper names and faulty recollection
highlight the formation of screen memories.

At first sight, the differences of both is far more conspicuous than their possible analogies.
There are personal name here to complete impressions to either in
reality or in thought, experienced, and there is a manifest failure
of the memory function, this is a memory capacity that seems strange,
there is a momentary disturbance - May have been because of the same
name forgotten reproduced hundreds of times before to be right and
it will be again tomorrow - here for permanent possession without
failure, as the indifferent Childhood memories seem to follow us through
a long piece of our life can be.

The riddle seems to be oriented quite differently in these two cases. There is the Forgotten,
here memorizing what our scientific curiosity makes lively. After some Well, you realize that
despite the difference in the psychological and material in the time period the two phenomena, the similarities
far outweigh. It is here and there to To the failure of memory, it is not reproduced from memory,
which correctly should be reproduced, but something else to compensate. The case of forgetting
names not missing the memory performance in the form of the alternative name. The case of the screen
memory formation is based on forgetting other major impressions. In both cases, us intellectual
perception of the individual interference of a disturbance, but each time in another form.
When we forget to know that the alternative name is wrong; at the concealing memories surprise
us that we possess. If it proves the psychological analysis, that the substitute formation in both
cases the same way by moving along a superficial association is established, so just take the
differences in Material in the time period and in the centering of the two phenomena contributes
to our expectation increase that we have found something important and generally valid term.
This General would be that the failure of reproductive function and straying far more frequently as
we suspect, pointing to the interference of a partisan factor, a tendency which which favors
a reminder, while it is trying to work against another.

IV

The promise.

If this familiar material protected by our speech in the mother tongue against forgetting appears,
so its use is subject to the more often a different disorder, which "promise" known. The promise
of the normal people watching gives the impression of the precursor absorbed for the occurring
under pathological conditions. "Paraphasias".

My location is in the exceptional position to appreciate a preliminary
study.

In In 1895 Meringer and C. Mayer, a study on "promises and misreading" published in their viewpoints
do not come close to mine. One of the authors of the texts in the Word is out, that linguists and linguistic
interests of the investigation been initiated to follow the rules that appear to offer. He hoped
these Rules for the presence "to a certain mental mechanism Hide",
"in which the sounds of a word or a sentence, and the words to each
other in very peculiar Are connected, and linked "(p. 10).

The authors grouped the data collected by them examples of the "promise" first to purely descriptive
point of view than permutations (such as the Venus of Milo instead of Venus de Milo). Bálint
or anticipations (for example, I was on the sister ... on the chest so hard), echoes, post positions
(eg, "I urge you to consider the good of our heads push on for a toast), contamination (eg, "He
sits on the back of his head off": "He is a head is going" and "he stood up on its hind legs"), substitutions
(eg "I give the drugs in the mailbox" instead Brütkasten), nor on
what the main categories some less important (or less important for
our purposes) are added.

It makes In this group no difference whether the conversion, misrepresentation, merger, etc.
individual sounds of words, syllables or entire words of the intended rate concerns.

To explain the observed species of the promise is Meringer a different mental Quality of speech
sounds on. If we are the first the sound of a word, the first word of a Innervate rate used, already
the excitation process the later sounds, the following Words, and as far as these innervations are
with each other simultaneously, they may hold, Modifying influence. The excitement of the mentally
intense loud sounds or echoes after, in which prevents the inferior Innervationsvorgang. It is
now a matter of determining, which the highest-quality sounds of a word. Meringer said: "If one
wants to know what Sounds of a word, the highest intensity belongs,
so watch it come up when searching for a forgotten word, such as a
name.

What first comes back to mind was, at least the greatest intensity from oblivion (p. 160). The high-quality
sounds are to say the initial sound the root syllable and the Wortanlaut and or accented vowels
"(p. 162).

I can not help but raise a contradiction here. Whether the initial sound of the name of the highest
quality Elements of the word belongs or not, it is certainly not true that he, in the case of the
word oblivion first comes back to mind, the above rule is useless. If you look at looking for a forgotten
name is observed, it is relatively frequent and the To express belief, he will begin with a specific
letter. This conviction just as often proves to be unfounded as justified as. Yes, I say, you
want to proclaimed in the majority of cases, an incorrect initial sound. In our example Signorelli
is on the alternative name of the initial sound and are the main
syllables have been lost, just the inferior elli syllable pair is
returned in the name of spare Botticelli consciousness.

If you suspect area indicates that a similar mechanism as that of the forgetting of names also
demonstrated in the phenomena of the promise could have a share, it will be to a reasoned
assessment of the lower cases of promise out. The disturbance in the Speech which manifests
itself as a promise, can only be caused by the influence another component of the same speech,
that is, by Vorklingen or reverberation, or by a second version in the sentence or context, we express
the intended - here are all top Meringer and Mayer borrowed examples - and secondly but the problem
could be analogous to the process in the case: Signorelli are due
to influences outside of this word, phrase or relationship of elements
here, the express is not intended, and the excitation is obtained
only by the very disorder knowledge. would be in the simultaneity
of excitement in common, in the position inside or outside of the
same sentence or the distinctive relationship for the two types of
development Promise.

The difference appears initially not as great as he for some conclusions from the symptomatology
of the promise is concerned. However, it is clear that only In the former case has a chance,
from the phenomena of the promise of a mechanism to conclusions to pull the sounds and words
to influence their mutual articulation with each other linked, so conclusions as to win the
linguist from the study of the promise hoped. In the case of interference by outside influences
of the same sentence or speech relationship Would it be all about getting to know the disturbing
elements, and then would lead to the question of whether the mechanism of this disorder to the
suspect in laws governing the formation of language can reveal.

One must not claim that Meringer Mayer and the possibility of speech defect complicated by " mental
influences, "by elements outside of the same word, sentence or the same speech sequence have overlooked.
You had to notice that the theory of mental inequality the sounds made rigorous only for the
elucidation of the sound disturbances, and the pros and echoes sufficient. Where the word faults
can not be reduced to sound disturbances, such as the Substitutions and contaminations of
words have also the cause of it is harmless Promise outside of the intended relationship and looking
for this fact by fine examples shown. I quote the following passages:

(P. 62) "Ru. tells of events which he explains in his heart for "obscenities". He investigated but after
a mild form and begins: "But then facts are Vorschwein to come ..." Mayer and I were present and Ru.
confirmed that he had thought "filth." That this thought in word "fore" betrayed and suddenly
was found effective in the Similarity of the words its sufficient
explanation.

"-

(P. 73) »play Even with the substitutions as for the contamination and presumptive much higher
degree, the "floating" or "vagrant" imagery an important role.
 Thus Poetry is a more philosophical
thing, and a more serious, than History: for Poetry tells of the Universal, History of the
Particular. Now the business of the Universal is to tell us how it will fall to such and such
a person to speak or act in such or such circumstances according to likelihood or necessity:
and it is at this that Poetry aims in giving characters names of its own: whereas the Particular
narrates what Alcibiades did or what happened to him."

       *       *       *       *       *

This may seem a hard saying, even after what has been said. So let us pause and digest it in
Sir Philip Sidney's comment: "... Thus farre Aristotle, which reason of his (as all his) is
most full of reason. For indeed, if the question were whether it were better to have a particular
acte truly or falsely set down, there is no doubt which is to be chosen, no more than whether
you had rather have Vespasian's picture right as hee was or at the Painter's pleasure nothing
resembling. But if the question be for your owne use and learning, whether it be better to
have it set downe as it should be, or as it was, then certainly is more doctrinable the fayned
Cyrus of Xenophon than the true Cyrus in Justine, and the fayned �neas in Virgil than the true
�neas in Dares Phrygius."

       *       *       *       *       *

But now, having drawn breath, let us follow our Poet from the lowest up to the highest of his
claim. And be it observed, to start with, that in clearing and cleansing the Idea for us (in
the manner described) he does but employ a process of Selection which all men are employing,
all day long and every day of their lives, upon more trivial matters; a process indeed which
every man is constantly obliged to employ. Life would be a night-mare for him, soon over, if
he had to take account, for example, of every object flashed on the retina of his eye during
a country walk. How many millions of leaves, stones, blades of grass, must he not see without
seeing? Say it be the shortest of rambles on an afternoon in early November. The light fades
early: but before he reaches home in the dark, how many of the myriad falling leaves has he
counted?--a dozen at most. Of the myriad leaves changing colour does he preserve, unless by
chance, the separate image of one? Rather from the mass over which his eyes have travelled
he has abstracted an "idea" of autumnal colouring--yellow, red, brown--and with that he carries
home a sentimental, perhaps even a profound, sense of the falling leaf, the falling close of
the year.

(As a matter of fact, oak leaves are singularly tenacious, and the autumnal oak will show a
thousand for the elm's one. Hood, being a Cockney, took his seven leaves at random. But what
does it matter? He was a poet, and seven leaves sufficed him to convey the idea.)

       *       *       *       *       *

Nor does our Poet, unless he be a charlatan, pretend to bring home some hieratic message above
the understanding of his fellows: for he is an interpreter, and the interpreter's success depends
upon hitting his hearer's intelligence. Failing that, he misses everything and is null. To
put it in another way--at the base of all Literature, of all Poetry, as of all Theology, stands
one rock: the very highest Universe Truth is something so absolutely simple that a child can
understand it. This is what Emerson means when he tells us that the great writers never seem
to condescend; that yonder slip of a boy who has carried off Shakespeare to the window-seat,
can feel with King Harry or Hamlet or Coriolanus, with Rosalind or Desdemona or Miranda. For
the moment he is any given one of these, because any human soul contains them all.

       *       *       *       *       *

And here let us dwell a moment on Johnson's phrase, "to which every bosom returns an echo":
for it recalls us to a point, which we noted indeed on p. 22, but have left (I fear) somewhat
under-emphasised--the emotion that enters into poetical truth, which only by the help of emotion
is apprehended; as through emotion it is conveyed, and to an emotional understanding in the
hearer addresses its appeal. For the desire of man's soul after the Universal, to be in harmony
with it, is (as a matter of fact, and when all pulpit eloquence has been discounted) something
more than a mere intellectual attraction: a στοργή rather; a yearning felt in its veins to
know its fatherhood. Saint Paul goes farther and assures us that "the earnest expectation of
the creature waiteth for the manifestation," so that "the whole creation groaneth and travaileth
in pain together until now." Hans Gross, Criminal Psychology 1898th

[17] See Bernheim, new studies
of hypnotism, suggestion and Psychotherapy, 1892.

  VII
  
  The lay hands.

The commendable work of Meringer Mayer and I understand even the place (p. 98):

"The speech errors do not stand alone. I certainly did not, while I lived and sang
upon earth. Nay, I never even sang, but invited the Muse to sing to me and through me. Μη̂νιν
ἄειδε θεά ... Ἄνδρα μοι ἔννεπε, Μου̂σα.--Surely the dear fellow might remember the first line
of my immortal works! And if he does remember, and is only bringing it up against me that in
the intervals of doing my work in life I was a feeble fellow, go back and tell him that it
is likely enough, yet I fail to see how it can be any business of his, since it was only my
work that I ever asked for recognition. They say that I used to go about begging a dinner on
the strength of it. Did I?... I cannot remember. Anyhow, that nuisance is over sometime ago,
and his kitchen is safe!"

To you, who have followed the argument of this little book, the theory of poetic "inspiration"
will be intelligible enough. It earned a living in its day and, if revived in ours, might happily
supersede much modern chatter about art and technique.

The philosophers did poetry no great harm by being angry with it as an "inspired" thing: for
that, in a measure, it happens to be. They did it far more harm when they took it seriously
and made it out to be a form of teaching. For by the nature of things there happens to be something
of the pedant in every philosopher and the incurable propensity of the pedant is to remove
everything--but Literature especially--out of the category to which it belongs and consider
it in another with which it has but a remote concern. (Thus a man will talk of Chaucer as though
his inflexions were the most important thing about him.) Now to acclaim Homer as a great teacher,
and use him in the schools, was right enough so long as the Athenians remembered (and is right
enough for us, so long as we remember) how he teaches us, or rather educates. And from their
Eyes lit up such a superabundance of love and tenderness that he felt hot, though he looked
up and the eyes of the mother would have received in themselves. He reached only after her hand
and stroked it tenderly.

Then again an almost mischievous smile flitted over the exquisite face of the mother. The but had
their secret niches: the Miss Erna they had told their whole life story. Otherwise, they did
not do so easily - it was also a little proud! - But the good girl against them could not
help it. She concealed her son. How would the ascended be, if he had to listen, Erna had offered
to come to the stubborn uncle into the house! How they'll do that, she did not even temporarily,
had her beautiful zeal fully proclaimed, the love, but they shall find ways and means! Oh yes,
they'll already found! Because they want to see whether gentleness and love and better understanding
not triumphed over pride and defiance! It also sold a small dig at Theobald and mother's sharp
eye noticed very well, how about the girl's cheeks flew Glutwelle - Noticed this occurred despite
the dusk. Mother's eyes see through night and darkness and see through walls and mountains.

you only eat quietly, she thought quietly to himself, and seek diligently only the last, last remnant
of the rare food, and put together with the fresh fragrant bread only until the Plate stand
there, clean and bright, as if they were just out of the barrier.

When he done so quiet work, he leaned back comfortably and looked longingly at his pipe, long.
Softly, softly, he sighed there. He knew the box standing there next to the pipe was empty -
blank empty as his plate ... and its bag. How was he to buy tobacco
when the mother, the love had little to eat!

"What is man but the same pleasure-seeking, if he has the stomach full," he thought to himself.

But the mother had noticed the longing glance.

Smiling, she stood up, took a pipe and Box and bring them before the astonished son worked on
- she was completely flat with fragrant Tobacco, fully flat!

Since there was another storm, a storm joy.

"And how did you find the right mix equal, Mutting" he asked, steamed
even pleasant to go.

"Is it his father's compound."

A touch of sadness
passed through her heart, but he is not troubled: he only deepened
the quiet Joy of two good loving people.

And now Theobald felt only
really know that it was warm in the little rooms will dare and saw
how beautiful color glows in the oven the glow. 'Labor
improbus omnia vincit' tells him not half so much as a tale of the labours of Hercules; so
he will learn more of patience from Job or Griselda; more of chivalrous courage from Hector
or Roland or Launcelot or the tale of Palamon and Arcite; more of patriotism from the figures
in history--Leonidas, Horatius, Regulus, Joan of Arc, William Tell, Garibaldi, Gordon--that
have translated the Idea back into their own lives with the noblest simplicity, so that we
say of them that they are "epical figures" or "figures worthy of romance," thereby paying them
the highest compliment in our power: yes and more of Christian simplicity from my Uncle Toby,
Colonel Newcome, even Mr. Pickwick; than from a hundred copybook maxims concerning these virtues:
all these figures indeed illustrating the tritest copybook maxim of all--that "Example is better
than Precept."

The Poet then, having seized on the Idea and purged it of what is trivial or accidental, reclothes
it in a concrete dress and so represents it to us. And you will generally remark in the very
greatest poets that not only are the images they represent to us extraordinarily definite and
concrete and therefore vivid--as Dante, for example, will describe a Scene in Hell or in Paradise
with as much particularity as though he were writing a newspaper report; but this concreteness
of vision translates itself into a remarkable concreteness of speech. I suppose there was never
a more concrete writer than Shakespeare, and his practice of translating all his idea into
things which you can touch or see grew steadily stronger throughout his career, so that any
competent critic can in a moment distinguish his later writing from his earlier by its compression
of images in words, its forcible concretion of the various "parts of speech," its masterful
corv�e of nouns substantive to do the work of verbs, and so on. Take for example:--

Sleep that knits up the ravell'd sleeve of care.

Or--

  The multitudinous sea incarnadine,
  Making the green one red.

Or--

In the dark backward and abysm of time. Madam!" "Royal Egypt!" "Empress!" cry the waiting-maids
as she swoons.

When a poet can, as Shakespeare does here, seize upon a Universal truth and lay it bare; when,
apprehending passion in this instance, he can show it naked, the master of gods and levelling
queens with milkmaids--totus est in armis idem quando nudus est Amor; when he can reclothe
it in the sensuous body of Cleopatra, "Royal Egypt," and, rending the robe over that bosom,
reveal the Idea again in a wound so vividly that almost we see the nature of woman spirting,
like brood, against the heaven it defies; then we who have followed the Poet's ascending claims
arrive at his last and highest, yet at one which has lain implicit all along in his title.
He is a Poet--a "Maker." No one cared about her and the heart was suddenly hard to them as lead.
Peter suggested that they wanted to go into memory, and the girl was willed. It was as if she throws
at him now and declare themselves ready to him in all things obey.

To use the formula of a famous Headmaster of Winchester, "details can be arranged," when once
we have a clear notion of what Poetry is, and of what by nature it aims to do. That happens, yes.

One day he saw her write in her room. So absorbed was she that she
did not hear, as he opened the door. Silently he closed them again.
And paler than she, he stole away again. She wrote to him - he felt
it.
