Miles Hendon forgot all decorum in his delight; and surprised the King and wounded his dignity,
by throwing his arms around him and hugging him. The woman made her grateful adieux and started
away with her pig; and when the constable opened the door for her, he followed her out into
the narrow hall.  The justice proceeded to write in his record book.  Hendon, always alert,
thought he would like to know why the officer followed the woman out; so he slipped softly
into the dusky hall and listened.  He heard a conversation to this effect--

"It is a fat pig, and promises good eating; I will buy it of thee; here is the eightpence."

"Eightpence, indeed!  Thou'lt do no such thing.  It cost me three shillings and eightpence,
good honest coin of the last reign, that old Harry that's just dead ne'er touched or tampered
with.  A fig for thy eightpence!"

"Stands the wind in that quarter?  Thou wast under oath, and so swore falsely when thou saidst
the value was but eightpence.  Come straightway back with me before his worship, and answer
for the crime!--and then the lad will hang."

"There, there, dear heart, say no more, I am content.  Give me the eightpence, and hold thy
peace about the matter."

The woman went off crying:  Hendon slipped back into the court room, and the constable presently
followed, after hiding his prize in some convenient place.  The justice wrote a while longer,
then read the King a wise and kindly lecture, and sentenced him to a short imprisonment in
the common jail, to be followed by a public flogging.  The astounded King opened his mouth,
and was probably going to order the good judge to be beheaded on the spot; but he caught a
warning sign from Hendon, and succeeded in closing his mouth again before he lost anything
out of it. Hendon took him by the hand, now, made reverence to the justice, and the two departed
in the wake of the constable toward the jail. She became as white as the tablecloth. The heart wanted to escape the chest.
It was opened ith trembling hands â¦ Ahaa! Sighed rested, after of having eaten in a mere two
seconds. She placed his hand on his chest. Then wild the sweat away with a handkerchief, then resumed
rereading the letter with pace.

It was infact Cecilia, it was written in a gently ironic tone that had nothing offensive about
it. Manifested, surprised at his sudden as well as unexpected return. What the bee had stung after
four years of absence? His parents whom before him had opened the letter wer as surprised as he was.
They thought it was thoughtless for a few years. A fraction of a second which would probably soon after
be regreted. She agreed with this perspective completely. Although she had been permitted and even
recommended to answer to the family that maintained the relationship.

This letter will soon be gone and dismissed as expected. Then again he simultaneously became sad
and happy over the course of the next minute. Reading and rereading it to see if it had the
key. Was it truth or false. He replied to fast and apologized for his boldness and confirmed his previous
statement with new found precision. He after a few days replied to the child in a more kind and affectionate
way. He turned to writing Gonzalo but Dona Paula intervened. To be swift after a short time two young
men entered a formal relationship. He began to speak of marriage between Don Melchor and his nephew
in letters. Then after he visited Ron Rosendo. Finally after this everything was settled, thy agreed that
Gonzalo would return in spring to perform the marriage.

The love between the couple began to make them think in the nest
they would remain out the theatre and those who were there.

Gonzalo stumbled upon a group of people who spoke a the door.

He was recognized
they quickly surrounded him to greet him.

The first to through their arms around his neck was Don Mateo then
came Don Pedro Miranda and his child.

Then mayor roque after victoriano and his wife Dona Roasario along with his three daughters.
 Then he repeated the conversation which
the officer and the woman had had together in the hall, word for word, and ended with--

"There--have I set it forth correctly?  Should not I be able to set it forth correctly before
the judge, if occasion required?"

The man was dumb with fear and distress, for a moment; then he rallied, and said with forced
lightness--

"'Tis making a mighty matter, indeed, out of a jest; I but plagued the woman for mine amusement."

"Kept you the woman's pig for amusement?"

The man answered sharply--

"Nought else, good sir--I tell thee 'twas but a jest."

"I do begin to believe thee," said Hendon, with a perplexing mixture of mockery and half-conviction
in his tone; "but tarry thou here a moment whilst I run and ask his worship--for nathless,
he being a man experienced in law, in jests, in--"

He was moving away, still talking; the constable hesitated, fidgeted, spat out an oath or two,
then cried out--

"Hold, hold, good sir--prithee wait a little--the judge!  Why, man, he hath no more sympathy
with a jest than hath a dead corpse!--come, and we will speak further.  Ods body!  I seem to
be in evil case--and all for an innocent and thoughtless pleasantry. I am a man of family;
and my wife and little ones--List to reason, good your worship: what wouldst thou of me?"

"Only that thou be blind and dumb and paralytic whilst one may count a hundred thousand--counting
slowly," said Hendon, with the expression of a man who asks but a reasonable favour, and that
a very little one.

"It is my destruction!" said the constable despairingly.  "Ah, be reasonable, good sir; only
look at this matter, on all its sides, and see how mere a jest it is--how manifestly and how
plainly it is so.  And even if one granted it were not a jest, it is a fault so small that
e'en the grimmest penalty it could call forth would be but a rebuke and warning from the judge's
lips."

Hendon replied with a solemnity which chilled the air about him--

"This jest of thine hath a name, in law,--wot you what it is?"

"I knew it not!  Peradventure I have been unwise.  I never dreamed it had a name--ah, sweet
heaven, I thought it was original."

"Yes, it hath a name.  In the law this crime is called Non compos mentis lex talionis sic transit
gloria mundi."

"Ah, my God!"

"And the penalty is death!"

"God be merciful to me a sinner!"

"By advantage taken of one in fault, in dire peril, and at thy mercy, thou hast seized goods
worth above thirteenpence ha'penny, paying but a trifle for the same; and this, in the eye
of the law, is constructive barratry, misprision of treason, malfeasance in office, ad hominem
expurgatis in statu quo--and the penalty is death by the halter, without ransom, commutation,
or benefit of clergy."

"Bear me up, bear me up, sweet sir, my legs do fail me!  Be thou merciful--spare me this doom,
and I will turn my back and see nought that shall happen."

"Good! now thou'rt wise and reasonable.  And thou'lt restore the pig?"

"I will, I will indeed--nor ever touch another, though heaven send it and an archangel fetch
it.  Go--I am blind for thy sake--I see nothing.  I will say thou didst break in and wrest
the prisoner from my hands by force.  It is but a crazy, ancient door--I will batter it down
myself betwixt midnight and the morning."

"Do it, good soul, no harm will come of it; the judge hath a loving charity for this poor lad,
and will shed no tears and break no jailer's bones for his escape."

Chapter XXV. Hendon Hall.

As soon as Hendon and the King were out of sight of the constable, his Majesty was instructed
to hurry to a certain place outside the town, and wait there, whilst Hendon should go to the
inn and settle his account. Half an hour later the two friends were blithely jogging eastward
on Hendon's sorry steeds.  The King was warm and comfortable, now, for he had cast his rags
and clothed himself in the second-hand suit which Hendon had bought on London Bridge. What had to do to him? Blush also, and this was what led out in a perfect way.
Three were trembling voice, and after asking for health, did not know what to say. Loaded glances
of curious people contributed in pregnant women. Pablito happily came to Ventura, who had left
behind, and our young greeted warmly and directed first to the second one ceremonial pitch.

Paul smiled.

- What, do you not know? Ventura is my sister.

- Oh! How could he know? She is a woman ... How are you, Ventura?

The girl reached for him with a malicious and mocking speech that you just embarrass you.

They stood up to the house. Venturita ran ahead dragging his brother. Marched behind Dona Paula,
Cecilia, Gonzalo. Rosendo brought up the rear with his good friend Pedro Miranda. The streets
were dark. Only those hours burning lanterns corner. The distance between the three groups
was becoming larger.

Gonzalo began making desperate efforts to hold the conversation with your future wife and mother,
but it is not opened his mouth, dominated, no doubt, shame, and Dona Paula walked very far from
being a Madame de Stael. Nor had helped him Conversation Dictionary, the result was that it did not
prosper. By letters had come to trust. Dona Paula often put postscripts
in Cecilia. Gonzalo replied with a wisecrack, ordered prints, caricatures
for Ventura, and carried around as a member of the family. But now
the three experienced discomfort embarrassing. Our young in his life
he had spoken with Mrs. Belinchón, and Cecilia had only crossed the
words we said.

"Marry I will never doubt THAT!" said the King--and then told his own story; after which, Hendon
was sorry he had not destroyed the archangel.

During the last day of the trip, Hendon's spirits were soaring. His tongue ran constantly.
He talked about his old father, and his brother Arthur, and told of many things which illustrated
their high and generous characters; he went into loving frenzies over his Edith, and was so
glad-hearted that he was even able to say some gentle and brotherly things about Hugh.  He
dwelt a deal on the coming meeting at Hendon Hall; what a surprise it would be to everybody,
and what an outburst of thanksgiving and delight there would be.

It was a fair region, dotted with cottages and orchards, and the road led through broad pasture
lands whose receding expanses, marked with gentle elevations and depressions, suggested the
swelling and subsiding undulations of the sea.  In the afternoon the returning prodigal made
constant deflections from his course to see if by ascending some hillock he might not pierce
the distance and catch a glimpse of his home.  At last he was successful, and cried out excitedly--

"There is the village, my Prince, and there is the Hall close by! You may see the towers from
here; and that wood there--that is my father's park. Ah, NOW thou'lt know what state and grandeur
be! A house with seventy rooms--think of that!--and seven and twenty servants!  A brave lodging
for such as we, is it not so?  Come, let us speed--my impatience will not brook further delay."

All possible hurry was made; still, it was after three o'clock before the village was reached.
The travellers scampered through it, Hendon's tongue going all the time.  "Here is the church--covered
with the same ivy--none gone, none added."  "Yonder is the inn, the old Red Lion,--and yonder
is the market-place."  "Here is the Maypole, and here the pump --nothing is altered; nothing
but the people, at any rate; ten years make a change in people; some of these I seem to know,
but none know me." Don Melchor nothing could be objected to this purpose only laudable, Gonzalo
traveled a few days after some houses of relatives and friends, where for years have put his feet
to say goodbye, and a spring quiet and beautiful Watcher later entered the cell through the
UK round.

Do not remember Cecilia? We do not know.

In temperaments as our youth, the fire of passion turn is a long time, but eventually cause
havoc.

Three years have passed. He finished the race engineer who is short
and practice in England, and was determined to visit the main factories
in this country and in France and Germany. The moment lasted for studying
memory asaltÃ¡bale Cecilia from time to time, without reason, of
course, very lively emotion.

The next moment Hendon sprang to the ground before the great door, helped the King down, then
took him by the hand and rushed within. A few steps brought him to a spacious apartment; he
entered, seated the King with more hurry than ceremony, then ran toward a young man who sat
at a writing-table in front of a generous fire of logs.

"Embrace me, Hugh," he cried, "and say thou'rt glad I am come again! and call our father, for
home is not home till I shall touch his hand, and see his face, and hear his voice once more!"

But Hugh only drew back, after betraying a momentary surprise, and bent a grave stare upon
the intruder--a stare which indicated somewhat of offended dignity, at first, then changed,
in response to some inward thought or purpose, to an expression of marvelling curiosity, mixed
with a real or assumed compassion.  Presently he said, in a mild voice--

"Thy wits seem touched, poor stranger; doubtless thou hast suffered privations and rude buffetings
at the world's hands; thy looks and dress betoken it.  Whom dost thou take me to be?"

"Take thee?  Prithee for whom else than whom thou art?  I take thee to be Hugh Hendon," said
Miles, sharply.

The other continued, in the same soft tone--

"And whom dost thou imagine thyself to be?"

"Imagination hath nought to do with it!  Dost thou pretend thou knowest me not for thy brother
Miles Hendon?"

An expression of pleased surprise flitted across Hugh's face, and he exclaimed--

"What! thou art not jesting? can the dead come to life?  God be praised if it be so!  Our poor
lost boy restored to our arms after all these cruel years!  Ah, it seems too good to be true,
it IS too good to be true--I charge thee, have pity, do not trifle with me!  Quick--come to
the light--let me scan thee well!"

He seized Miles by the arm, dragged him to the window, and began to devour him from head to
foot with his eyes, turning him this way and that, and stepping briskly around him and about
him to prove him from all points of view; whilst the returned prodigal, all aglow with gladness,
smiled, laughed, and kept nodding his head and saying--

"Go on, brother, go on, and fear not; thou'lt find nor limb nor feature that cannot bide the
test.  Scour and scan me to thy content, my good old Hugh--I am indeed thy old Miles, thy same
old Miles, thy lost brother, is't not so?  Ah, 'tis a great day--I SAID 'twas a great day!
Give me thy hand, give me thy cheek--lord, I am like to die of very joy!"

He was about to throw himself upon his brother; but Hugh put up his hand in dissent, then dropped
his chin mournfully upon his breast, saying with emotion--

"Ah, God of his mercy give me strength to bear this grievous disappointment!"

Miles, amazed, could not speak for a moment; then he found his tongue, and cried out--

"WHAT disappointment?  Am I not thy brother?"

Hugh shook his head sadly, and said--

"I pray heaven it may prove so, and that other eyes may find the resemblances that are hid
from mine.  Alack, I fear me the letter spoke but too truly."

"What letter?"

"One that came from over sea, some six or seven years ago.  It said my brother died in battle."

"It was a lie!  Call thy father--he will know me."

"One may not call the dead."

"Dead?" Miles's voice was subdued, and his lips trembled.  "My father dead!--oh, this is heavy
news.  Half my new joy is withered now.  Prithee let me see my brother Arthur--he will know
me; he will know me and console me."

"He, also, is dead."

"God be merciful to me, a stricken man!  Gone,--both gone--the worthy taken and the worthless
spared, in me!  Ah! I crave your mercy!--do not say the Lady Edith--"

"Is dead?  No, she lives."

"Then, God be praised, my joy is whole again!  Speed thee, brother--let her come to me!  An'
SHE say I am not myself--but she will not; no, no, SHE will know me, I were a fool to doubt
it. Bring her--bring the old servants; they, too, will know me."

"All are gone but five--Peter, Halsey, David, Bernard, and Margaret."

So saying, Hugh left the room.  Miles stood musing a while, then began to walk the floor, muttering--

"The five arch-villains have survived the two-and-twenty leal and honest --'tis an odd thing."

He continued walking back and forth, muttering to himself; he had forgotten the King entirely. 

Formosa group in the House of Lords BelinchÃ³n door, which was located in Rua Nueva SarriÃ³ Main
Street, and was large and sumptuous, which was in vogue. Gonzalo has not eaten yet, Rosendo
invited him up to do with it so truly, and with words so pressing that the young man who wanted
nothing, he concluded to accept. They took leave parrot Mr. Miranda and his son, and family BelinchÃ³n
with the new guy was going to be part of it went to the house. At the reception, ladies removed
their clothes and shawls. Light returned to them annoying. Gonzalo and then saw his friend
and said that he has not won anything in years of absence. It was great, but also thinner. Love
is not fat girls. Nas, with whom he was even more pronounced. Only those beautiful eyes, smooth,
intelligent, continued to shine like two stars. Converting to venture that seemed to go to school,
clinging to jumping to keep up, I was very impressed. She was a woman, a real woman, not so much height
to width and roundness of forms for the singular power of eyes and some glitter accompanied
malicious. ExaminÃ¡ronse both as two strangers in a glance. Gonzalo said in his whisper at Dona
Paula: - What a difference Ventura! It's a beautiful girl. For less than what the girl said she
heard. became serious involvement, made a slight grimace of contempt
with their lips, and went straight to the dining room, pleasant tingling
hide that spontaneous compliment, so he had caused.

The table was set: a patriarchal provincial table, abundant, clean,
elegant flowers or other adjustments that civilization is introduced.

And they approached the task Gonzalo missing. It seemed that yesterday I had dinner there. The explosion
blew a joy for everyone. CambiÃ¡ronse words and laughter. Pablito Gonzalez
hugged and called for their horses. Dona Paula managed the distribution
of silver.



They shook their heads; then the master said--

"The servants know you not, sir.  I fear there is some mistake. You have seen that my wife
knew you not."

"Thy WIFE!"  In an instant Hugh was pinned to the wall, with an iron grip about his throat.
"Oh, thou fox-hearted slave, I see it all!  Thou'st writ the lying letter thyself, and my stolen
bride and goods are its fruit.  There--now get thee gone, lest I shame mine honourable soldiership
with the slaying of so pitiful a mannikin!"

Hugh, red-faced, and almost suffocated, reeled to the nearest chair, and commanded the servants
to seize and bind the murderous stranger.  They hesitated, and one of them said--

"He is armed, Sir Hugh, and we are weaponless."

"Armed!  What of it, and ye so many?  Upon him, I say!"

But Miles warned them to be careful what they did, and added--

"Ye know me of old--I have not changed; come on, an' it like you."

This reminder did not hearten the servants much; they still held back.

"Then go, ye paltry cowards, and arm yourselves and guard the doors, whilst I send one to fetch
the watch!" said Hugh. Much of our time was spent eating on the patio of the house of
a rich neighbor, and then off to do a little gambling. Cecilia, behind the crystal glass, would
sew the day away. Hand on his hat; a brief smile; please enter; and
then off to the bar. Next thing we knew, it was another day.  He will remain--doubt it not."

Chapter XXVI. Disowned.

The King sat musing a few moments, then looked up and said--

"'Tis strange--most strange.  I cannot account for it."

"No, it is not strange, my liege.  I know him, and this conduct is but natural.  He was a rascal
from his birth."

"Oh, I spake not of HIM, Sir Miles."

"Not of him?  Then of what?  What is it that is strange?"

"That the King is not missed."

"How?  Which?  I doubt I do not understand."

"Indeed?  Doth it not strike you as being passing strange that the land is not filled with
couriers and proclamations describing my person and making search for me?  Is it no matter
for commotion and distress that the Head of the State is gone; that I am vanished away and lost?" He had the conceit to think (to be exempted by God)
Cecilia rejected the suitors in your hand ... because none was so handsome as him. Then imagine
declare his love letter. Being so far away would not shame. However, had it, and when he tried
to take the pen to do so, before drawing the first line, turned to leave when they represented
the surprise that the young receive. It was a few days. The idea never left him.


"Might it not be best, my Prince, that we wait here until I prove myself and make my rights
secure to my domains?  I should be so much the better able then to--"

The King interrupted him imperiously--

"Peace!  What are thy paltry domains, thy trivial interests, contrasted with matters which
concern the weal of a nation and the integrity of a throne?"  Then, he added, in a gentle voice,
as if he were sorry for his severity, "Obey, and have no fear; I will right thee, I will make
thee whole--yes, more than whole.  I shall remember, and requite."

So saying, he took the pen, and set himself to work. The
age of love came a bit later for him. This usually happens in people who are hard on their muscle
nerves. Miss Belinchon, though not linda, awakened in him a certain feeling that can easily spark passion.
  See him scribble and scratch away contentedly at his meaningless pot-hooks, fancying
them to be Latin and Greek--and except my wit shall serve me with a lucky device for diverting
him from his purpose, I shall be forced to pretend to post away to-morrow on this wild errand
he hath invented for me."
