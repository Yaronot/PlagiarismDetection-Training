And yet he was so far aware of his own weakness, as to admit to himself that he would have
taken her back to him if she had answered his last letter in a contrite spirit and with affectionate
words. He would have endeavoured to forgive if not to forget, and would have allowed himself
to fall into the loving intimacy of domestic life,--but that she was cold and indifferent,
as well as treacherous. So he told himself, keeping his wrath hot, though at the same time
his love nearly mastered him. But in truth he knew nothing of things as they really were. He
had made the mistake of drawing a false conclusion from some words written by Sir Francis,
and then of looking upon those words as containing the whole truth. Sir Francis had no doubt
intended him to think that he and Cecilia Holt had come to some rupture in their engagement
from other than the real cause. He had intended Mr. Western to believe that they had both agreed,
and that they had merely resolved between them that they had better not be husband and wife.
He had intended to convey the idea that he had been more active in so arranging it than Cecilia
herself. Cecilia though she had read the letter had done so in such a frame of mind as hardly
to catch the truth. But he, Mr. Western, had caught it altogether, and had believed it. Though
he knew that the man was a dishonest liar yet he had believed the letter. He was tortured at
the thought that his wife should have made herself a party to such a compact, and that the
compact should still have remained in existence without his knowledge. Although there were
hours during which he was most anxious to return to her,--in which he told himself that it
was more difficult to stay away from her than even to endure her faithlessness; though from
day to day he became convinced that he could never return to the haunts of men or even to the
easy endurance of life without her, yet his pride would ever come back to him and assure him
that as a reasonable man he was unable to put up with such treachery. He had unfortunately
been taught to think, by the correspondence which had come from the matter of his cousin's
racing bet, that Sir Francis Geraldine was the very basest of mankind. It was unfortunate because
he had no doubt been induced to think worse of his wife because she had submitted herself and
continued to submit herself to a man who was in his eyes so contemptible. He could not endure
the idea that a woman for whom such a partnership had had charms should be the chosen companion
of all his hours. He had already lived with her for weeks which should have been enough to
teach him her character. During those weeks he had been satisfied to the very full. He had
assured himself frequently that he had at last met a woman that suited him and made her his
own. Had he known nothing of Sir Francis Geraldine he would have been thoroughly contented.
Then had come the blow, and all his joys were "sicklied over" with the unhealthy tone which
his image of her former lover gave him. She became at once to him a different creature. Though
he told himself that she was still the same Cecilia as had been his delight, yet he told himself
also that she was not the same as he had fancied her when he at first knew her.

There is in a man a pride of which a woman knows nothing. Or rather a woman is often subject
to pride the very opposite. The man delights to think that he has been the first to reach the
woman's heart. The woman is rejoiced to feel that she owns permanently that which has been
often reached before. The man may know that in his own case it is not so with him. But as there
has been no concealment, or perhaps only a little to conceal, he takes it as it comes and makes
the best of it. His Mary may have liked some other one, but it has not gone farther. Or if
she has been engaged as a bride there has been no secret about it. Or it has been a thing long
ago so that there has been time for new ideas to form themselves. The husband when he does
come knows at any rate that he has no ground of complaint, and is not kept specially in the
dark when he takes his wife. But Mr. Western had been kept specially in the dark, and was of
all men the least able to endure such treatment. To have been kept in the dark as to the man
with whom the girl was engaged, as he thought, at the very moment in which she had accepted
him! To have been made use of as a step, on which a disadvantageous marriage might be avoided
without detriment to her own interest! It was this feeling which made him utterly prostrate,--which
told him that death itself would be the one desirable way out of his difficulties if death
were within his reach.

When he received the letter from his sister telling him that he might probably become the father
of a child, he was at the first prepared to say that thus would they two be reconciled. He
could hardly live apart, not only from the mother of his child, but from the child itself.
He went away into solitude and wept hot tears as he thought of it all. But ever as he thought
of it the cause of his anger came back to him and made him declare to himself that in the indulgence
of no feeling of personal tenderness ought he to disgrace himself. At any rate it could not
be till she should have told him the whole truth,--till she should have so told her story as
to enable him to ascertain whether that story were in all respects true. At present, as he
said to himself, he was altogether in the dark. But in fact had he now learned the very story
as it had existed, and had Cecilia told it as far as she was able to tell it all, she would
even in his estimation have been completely white-washed. In her perfect absolution from the
terrible sin of which he now accused her he would have forgiven and forgotten altogether the
small, the trifling fault, which she had in truth committed.

There was something of nobility in all these feelings;--but then that something was alloyed
by much that was ignoble. He had resolved that were she to come back to him she must come acknowledging
the depth of her sin. He would endeavour to forgive though he could not forget; but he never
thought to himself in these hours that it would be well for him to be gracious in his manner
of forgiveness. To go to her and fetch her home to him, and say to her that all that was past
should be as a dream, a sad and ugly dream, but one to which no reality was attached, never
occurred to him. He must still be the master, and, in order that his masterdom might be assured,
full and abject confession must be made. Yet he had such an idea of his wife, that he felt
that no such confession would be forthcoming, and therefore to him it appeared ever more and
more impossible that they two should again come together.

With Cecilia the matter was regarded with very different eyes. To her, too, it was apparent
that she had been treated with extremest cruelty. She, too, was very hot in her anger. In discussing
the matter with herself, she allowed herself thoughts in which indignation against her husband
was maintained at a boiling heat. But nevertheless she had quite resolved to forgive him altogether
if he would once come to her. And to insure her forgiveness no word even of apology should
be necessary. She knew that she would have to deal with a man to whom the speaking of such
words would be painful, and none should be expected, none asked for. If he would but show her
that he still loved her, that should suffice. The world around them would of course know that
she had been sent away from him, and then taken back. There was in this much that was painful,--a
feeling full of dismay as she reflected that all her friends, that her acquaintance, that the
very servants should know that she had been so disgraced. But of all that she would take no
notice,--no notice as far as the outside world was concerned. Let them think, let them talk
as they would, she would then have her one great treasure with which to console herself, and
that treasure, if once more her own, would suffice for her happiness. In her hottest anger
she told herself from time to time that her anger would all depart from her,--that it would
be made to vanish from her as by a magician's wand,--if she could only once more be allowed
to feel his arm round her waist.

In all this she had no friend with whom to discuss either her anger or her hopes. Her mother
she knew shared her anger to the full, but entertained hopes altogether different. Her desires
were so different that they hardly amounted to hopes. Yes, he might be allowed to return, but
with words of absolute contrition, with words which should always be remembered against him.
Such would have been Mrs. Holt's expression as to the state of things had she ventured to express
herself. But she understood enough of her daughter's feelings to repress them.

The only person who sympathised with Cecilia and her present condition was the girl who had
once before evoked from her so strong a feeling of tenderness. She did know that the man had
to be forgiven, terrible as had been his sin, and that nothing more was to be said about it.
"Oh, ma'am," she said, "he'll come back now! I'm sure he'll come back now, and never more have
any of them silly vagaries."

"Who can say what vagaries a man may choose to indulge?"

"That's true too, ma'am. That any man should have had such a vagary as this! But he's dying
to come back. I'm sure of it. And when he does come and finds that he's let to come quiet,
and that he's asked to say nothing as he don't like, and that you are all smiles to him and
kindness,--and then with the baby coming and all,--my belief is that he'll be happier then
than he was even the first day when he had you." This, though spoken in rough language, so
exactly expressed Cecilia's wishes, that she did feel that her maid at least entirely sympathised
with her.

CHAPTER XIX.

DICK TAKES HIS FINAL LEAVE.

When Sir Francis received the reply which Miss Altifiorla sent to his letter, he was not altogether
satisfied with it. He had expected that the lady would at once have flown into his arms. But
the lady seemed to hesitate, and asked for a week to think about it. This showed so much ingratitude
on her part,--was so poor an acknowledgment of the position which he had offered her, that
he was inclined to be indignant. "D---- it; if she don't care about it she sha'n't have it."
It was thus that he expressed himself aloud in the hearing of Dick Ross; but without however
explaining who the she was, or what the it was, or indeed in any way asking Dick's opinion
on the matter. Not the less had Miss Altifiorla been wise in the nature of the reply which
she had given. Had she expressed her warm affection, and at once accepted all that had been
proffered, the gentleman would probably have learnt at once to despise that which had been
obtained so easily. As it was he was simply cross, and thought that he had determined to withdraw
the proposal. But still the other letter was to come, and Miss Altifiorla's chance was still
open to her.

The immediate consequence of these doubts in the mind of Sir Francis was a postponement of
the verdict of banishment which he had resolved to pronounce against Dick as soon as his marriage
with Miss Altifiorla should have been settled. He did not wish to leave himself altogether
alone in the world, and if this Dick were dismissed it would be necessary that he should provide
himself with another,--unless he were minded to provide himself with a wife instead. He became
therefore gradually more gracious after the little speech which has been above given. Dick
had understood perfectly who the "she" had been, and what was the "it" intended. As no question
had been asked he had made no reply, but he was quite quick enough to perceive the working
of the Baronet's mind. He despised the Baronet almost as thoroughly as did Mr. Western. But
for certain purposes,--as to which he despised himself also,--the friendship of the Baronet
suited him just at present.

One morning, for private reasons of his own, Dick went into Perth, which was twenty miles distant
from the Baronet's shooting lodge, and returned the same day bringing the postbag with him
from a point in the road at which it was daily left by the postman. Sir Francis with unusual
haste read his letters, and among them was one from Miss Altifiorla. But Dick had a budget
of news which he was anxious to reveal, and which he did tell before Sir Francis had said anything
as to his own letter. There was another friend, one Captain Fawkes, at the Lodge with them,
and Dick had at first been restrained by this man's presence. As soon as he found himself alone
with Sir Francis he began. "Lady Grant has gone off to Dresden," he said.

"Where did you hear that?" asked the Baronet.

"They told me so at the club. Everybody in Perth knows that she has gone;--and why."

"What business is it of theirs? Since you know so much about it, why has she gone?"

"To persuade her brother to come home and take his wife once more. It was an infernal shame
that they should ever have been separated. In fact she has gone to undo what you did. If she
can only succeed in making the man know the whole truth about it, free from all lies, she'll
do what she's gone to do."

"What the devil do you mean by lies?" said Sir Francis, rising in wrath from his chair.

    They haven't a great
deal of money among them, and when Mrs. Holt dies Cecilia's fortune would be a nice addition."

"I don't think Lady Grant can have thought of that," said Mrs. Thorne.

"Lady Grant would be quite prudent in thinking of it and like the rest of the world. Her husband
was only a regimental officer in India who got knighted for doing something that came in his
way. There isn't any family property among them, and of course she is anxious."

This solicitude as to "family property" on the part of Miss Altifiorla did strike Mrs. Thorne
as droll. But she went on with her inquiries. "And what is Cecilia doing?"

"Not very much," said Miss Altifiorla. "What is there for her to do? Poor girl! She has played
her cards so uncommonly badly, when she took up with Mr. Western after having been dropped
by Sir Francis."

"After dropping Sir Francis!"

Miss Altifiorla smiled. Was it likely that Cecilia Holt should have dropped Sir Francis? "It
doesn't much matter now. If it does her wounded pride good to say so of course she can say it."

"We always believed that it was so at the Deanery."

"At any rate she made a mess of it. And now she has to bear the fortune which her fates have
sent her. I own that I am a little angry with Cecilia, not for having dropped Sir Francis as
you called it, but for managing her matters so badly with Mr. Western. She seems to me to have
no idea of the sort of duties which fall to the lot of a wife."

"I should have thought you'd have liked her the better for that," said Mrs. Thorne, with a smile.

"Why so? I think you must have misunderstood my theory of life. When a woman elects to marry,
and does so from sheer love and regard for the man, she should certainly make her duty to him
the first motive of all her actions."

"What a grand lesson! It is a pity that my husband should not be here to hear it."

"I have no doubt he finds that you do so."

"Or Sir Francis Geraldine. I suppose my uncle is still in search of a wife, and if he knew
where to find such excellent principles he would be able to make his choice. What a joke it
would be should he again try his luck at Exeter?"

"He has again tried his luck at Exeter," said Miss Altifiorla, in a tone in which some slight
shade of ridicule was mixed with the grandiloquence which she wished to assume.

"What on earth do you mean?" said Mrs. Thorne.

"Simply what I seem to mean. I had not intended to have told you at present, though I would
sooner tell you than any person living. You must promise me, however, that it shall go no further.
Sir Francis Geraldine has done me the honour to ask me to be his wife." Thus she communicated
her good news; and did so in a tone of voice that was very low, and intended to be humble.

"My uncle going to marry you? Good gracious!"

"Is it more wonderful than that he should have thought of marrying Cecilia Holt?"

"Well, yes. Not that I know why it should be, except that Cecilia came first, and that you
and she were so intimate."

"Was he doomed to remain alone in the world because of that?" asked Miss Altifiorla.

"Well, no; I don't exactly mean that. But it is droll."

"I hope that the Dean and Mrs. Hippesley will be satisfied with his choice. I do particularly
hope that all his friends will feel that he is doing well. But," she added, perceiving that
her tidings had not been received with any strong expression of family satisfaction--"but I
trust that, as Lady Geraldine, I may at any rate be the means of keeping the family together."

There was to Mrs. Thorne almost a joke in this, as she knew that her father did not at all
approve of Sir Francis, and was with difficulty induced to have him at the Deanery. And she
knew also that the Dean did in his heart greatly dislike Miss Altifiorla, though for the sake
of what was generally called "peace within the cathedral precincts," he had hitherto put up
also with her. What might happen in the Dean's mind, or what determination the Dean might take
when the two should be married, she could not say. But she felt that it might probably be beyond
the power of the then Lady Geraldine "to keep the family together." "Well, I am surprised,"
said Mrs. Thorne. "And I am to tell nobody."

"I don't see any good in publishing the thing in High Street just at present." Then Mrs. Thorne
understood that she need not treat the communication as a strict secret. "In fact, I don't
see why it should be kept specially in the dark. Francis has not enjoined anything like secrecy."
This was the first time that she had allowed herself the use of the Baronet's name without
the prefix. "When it is to be I have not as yet even begun to think. Of course he is in a hurry.
Men, I believe, generally are. But in this case there may be some reasons for delay. Arrangements
as to the family property must be made, and Castle Gerald must be prepared for our reception.
I don't suppose we can be married just off hand, like some happier folks." Mrs. Thorne did
not know whether to take this to herself, as she had been married herself at last rather in
a scramble, or whether it was intended to apply to poor Cecilia, whose husband, though he was
in comfortable circumstances, cannot be said to have possessed family property. "And now, dear;"
continued Miss Altifiorla, "what am I to do for bridesmaids? You three have all been married
before me. There are his two unmarried sisters of course." Mrs. Thorne was aware that her uncle
had absolutely quarrelled with his mother and sisters, and had not spoken to them for years.
"I suppose that it will come off in the cathedral, and that your father will perform the ceremony.
I don't know, indeed, whether Francis might not wish to have the Bishop." Mrs. Thorne was aware
that the Bishop, who was a strict man, would not touch Sir Francis Geraldine with a pair of
tongs. "But all these things will shake themselves down comfortably no doubt. In the meantime
I am in a twitter of ecstatic happiness. You, who have gone through it all, will quite understand
what I mean. It seems that as a lover he is the most exigeant of gentlemen. He requires constant
writing to, and woe betide me if I do not obey his behests. However, I do not complain, and
must confess that I am at the present moment the most happy of young women."

Mrs. Thorne of course expressed her congratulations, and took her departure without having
committed herself to a word as to the other inhabitants of the Deanery. But when she got to
her father's house, where she was for the present staying, she in truth startled them all by
the news. The Dean had just come into the drawing-room to have his afternoon tea and a little
gossip with his wife and his own sister, Mrs. Forrester, from London. "Who do you think is
going to be married, and to whom?" said Mrs. Thorne. "I'll give you all three guesses apiece,
and bet you a pair of gloves all round that you don't make it out."

"Not Miss Altifiorla?" said her mother.

"That's only one. A marriage requires two personages. I still hold good by my bet."

"Miss Altifiorla going to be married!" said the Dean. "Who is the unfortunate victim?"

"Papa, do not be ill-natured. Why should not Miss Altifiorla be married as well as another?"

"In the first place, my dear," said Mrs. Forrester, "because I understand that the lady has
always expressed herself as being in favour of a single life."

"I go beyond that," said the Dean, "and maintain that any single life would be preferable to
a marriage with Miss Altifiorla."

"Considering that she is my friend, papa, I think that you are very unkind."

"But who is to be the gentleman?" asked her mother.

"Ah! there's the question! Why don't you guess?" Then Mrs. Dean did name three or four of the
most unpromising unmarried elderly gentlemen in Exeter, and the Dean, in that spirit of satire
against his own order which is common among clergymen, suggested an old widowed Minor Canon,
who was in the habit of chanting the Litany. "You are none of you near the mark. You ought
to come nearer home."

"Nearer home?" said Mrs. Dean with a look of discomfort in her face.

"Yes, mamma. A great deal nearer home."

"It can't be your Uncle Septimus," said the Dean. Now Uncle Septimus was the unmarried brother
of old Mr. Thorne, and was regarded by all the Thorne family as a perfect model of an unselfish,
fine old lovable gentleman.

"Good gracious, no!" said Mrs. Thorne. "What a horrible idea! Fancy Uncle Septimus doomed to
pass his life in company with Miss Altifiorla! The happy man in question is--Sir Francis Geraldine."

"No!" said Mrs. Hippesley, jumping from her seat.

"It is impossible," said the Dean, who, though he greatly disliked his brother-in-law, still
thought something of the family into which he had married, and thoroughly despised Miss Altifiorla.
"I do not think that Sir Francis could be so silly as that."

"It cannot be," said Mrs. Hippesley.

"What has the young lady done to make it impossible?" asked Mrs. Forrester.

"Nothing on earth," said Mrs. Thorne. "She is my special friend and is in my opinion a great
deal more than worthy of my uncle Francis. Only papa, who dislikes them both, would like to
make it out that the two of them are going to cut their own throats each by marrying the other.
I wish papa could have heard the way in which she said that he would have to marry them,--unless
the Bishop should like to come forward and perform the ceremony."

"I shall do nothing of the kind," said the Dean angrily.

"If you had heard," continued his daughter, "all that she had to say about the family name
and the family property, and the family grandeur generally, you would have thought her the
most becoming young woman in the country to be the future Lady Geraldine."

"I wish you wouldn't talk of it, my dear," said Mrs. Hippesley.

"We shall have to talk of it, and had better become used to it among ourselves. I don't suppose
that Miss Altifiorla has invented the story out of her own head. She would not say that she
was engaged to marry my uncle if it were not true."

"It's my belief," said the Dean, getting up and walking out of the room in great anger, "that
Sir Francis Geraldine will never marry Miss Altifiorla."

"I don't think my brother will ever marry Miss Altifiorla," said Mrs. Dean. "He is very silly
and very vicious, but I don't think he'll ever do anything so bad as that."

"Poor Miss Altifiorla!" said Mrs. Thorne afterwards to her Aunt Forrester.

That same evening Miss Altifiorla, feeling that she had broken the ice, and, oppressed by the
weight of the secret which was a secret still in every house in Exeter except the Deanery,
wrote to her other friend Mrs. Green, and begged her to come down. She had tidings to tell
of the greatest importance. So Mrs. Green put on her bonnet and came down. "My dear," said
Miss Altifiorla, "I have something to tell you. I am going to be--"

"Not married!" said Mrs. Green.

"Yes, I am. How very odd that you should guess. But yet when I come to think of it I don't
know that it is odd. Because after all there does come a time in,--a lady's life when it is
probable that she will marry." Miss Altifiorla hesitated, having in the first instance desired
to use the word girl.

"That's as may be," said Mrs. Green. "Your principles used to be on the other side."

"Of course all that changes when the opportunity comes. It wasn't so much that I disliked the
idea of marriage, for myself, as that I was proud of the freedom which I enjoyed. However that
is all over. I am free no longer."

"And who is it to be?"

"Ah, who is it to be? Can you make a guess?"

"Not in the least. I don't know of anybody who has been spooning you."

"Oh, what a term to use! No one can say that anyone ever--spooned me. It is a horrible word.
And I cannot bear to hear it fall from my own lips."

"It is what young men do do," said Mrs. Green.

"That I think depends on the rank in life which the young men occupy;--and also the young women.
I can understand that a Bank clerk should do it to an attorney's daughter."

"Well; who is it you are going to marry without spooning, which in my vocabulary is simply
another word for two young people being fond of each other?" Miss Altifiorla remained silent
for a while, feeling that she owed it to herself to awe her present companion by her manner
before she should crush her altogether by the weight of the name she would have to pronounce.
Mrs. Green had received her communication flippantly, and had probably felt that her friend
intended to demean herself by some mere common marriage. "Who is to be the happy swain?" asked
Mrs. Green.

"Swain!" said Miss Altifiorla, unable to repress her feelings.

"Well; lover, young man, suitor, husband as is to be. Some word common on such occasion will
I suppose fit him?"

Miss Altifiorla felt that no word common on such occasions would fit him. But yet it was necessary
that she should name him, having gone so far. And, having again been silent for a minute, so
as to bethink herself in what most dignified language this might be done, she proceeded. "I
am to be allied,"--again there was a little pause,--"to Sir Francis Geraldine!"

"Him Cecilia Holt rejected!"

"Him who I think was fortunate enough to escape Cecilia Holt."

"Goodness gracious! It seems but the other day."

"Cecilia Holt has since recovered from her wounds and married another husband, and is now suffering
from fresh wounds. Is it odd that the gentleman should have found some one else to love when
the lady has had time not only to love but to marry, and to be separated from another man?"

"Sir Francis Geraldine!" ejaculated Mrs. Green. "Well; I'm sure I wish you all the joy in the
world. When is it to be?" But Mrs. Green had so offended Miss Altifiorla by her manner of accepting
the news that she could not bring herself to make any further gracious answer. Mrs. Green therefore
took her leave, and the fact of Miss Altifiorla's engagement was soon known all over Exeter.

CHAPTER XXI.

LADY GRANT AT DRESDEN.

"You have first to believe the story as I tell it you, and get out of your head altogether
the story as you have conceived it." This was said by Lady Grant to her brother when she had
travelled all the way to Dresden with the purpose of inducing him to take his wife back. She
had come there solely with that object, and it must be said of her that she had well done her
duty as a sister. But she found it by no means easy to induce her brother to look at the matter
with her eyes. In fact, it was evident to her that he did not believe the story as she had
told it. She must go on and din it into his ears till by perseverance she should change his
belief. He still thought that credit should be given to that letter from Sir Francis, although
he was aware that to Sir Francis himself as a man he would have given no credit whatsoever.
It had suited his suspicions to believe that there had been something in common between Sir
Francis and his wife up to the moment in which the terrible fact of her engagement had been
made known to him; and from that belief he could not free his mind. He had already been persuaded
to say that she should come back to him; but she should come as a sinner confessing her sin.
He would take her back, but as one whom he had been justified in expelling, and to whom he
should be held as extending great mercy.

But Lady Grant would not accept of his mercy, nor would she encourage her coming back with
such a purpose. It would not be good in the first place for him that he should think that his
wife had been an offender. His future happiness must depend on his fixed belief in her purity
and truth. And, as for her,--Lady Grant was sure that no entreaties would induce her to own
that she had been in the wrong. She desired to have no pardon asked, but would certainly ask
for no pardon on her own behalf.

"Why was it that he came, then, to my house?" asked Mr. Western.

"Am I, or rather is she, to account for the conduct of such a man as that? Are you to make
her responsible for his behaviour?"

"She was engaged to him."

"Undoubtedly. It should have been told to you,--though I can understand the reasons which kept
her silent from day to day. The time will come when you will understand it also, and know,
as I do, how gracious and how feminine has been her silence." Then there came across her brother's
face a look of doubt as indicating his feeling that nothing could have justified her silence.
"Yes, George; the time will come that you will understand her altogether although you are far
from doing so now."

"I believe you think her to be perfect," said he.

"Hardly perfect, because she is a human being. But although I know her virtues I have not known
her faults. It may be that she is too proud,--a little unwilling, perhaps, to bend. Most women
will bend whether they be in fault or not. But would you wish your wife to do so?"

"I, at any rate, have not asked her."

"You, at any rate, have not given her the opportunity. My accusation against you is, that you
sent her away from you on an accusation made solely by that man, and without waiting to hear
from herself whether she would plead guilty to it."

"I deny it."

"Yes; I hear your denial. But you will have to acknowledge it, at any rate to yourself, before
you can ever hope to be a happy man."

"When he wrote to me, I believed the whole story to be a lie from first to last."

"And when you found that it was not all a lie, then it became to you a gospel throughout. You
could not understand that the very faults which had induced her to break her engagement were
of a nature to make him tell his story untruly."

"When she acknowledged herself to have been engaged to him it nearly broke my heart."

"Just so. And, with your heart broken, you would not sift the truth. She had committed no offence
against you in engaging herself."

"She should have told me as soon as we knew each other."

"She should have told you before she accepted your offer. But she had been deterred from doing
so by your own revelation to her. You cannot believe that she intended you always to be in
the dark. You cannot imagine that she had expected that you should never hear of her adventure
with Sir Francis Geraldine."

"I do not know."

"I had heard it, and she knew that I had heard it."

"Why did you not tell me, then?"

"Do you suppose that I wished to interfere between you and your wife? Of course I told her
that you ought to know. Of course I told her that you ought to have known it already. But she
excused herself,--with great sorrow. Things had presented themselves in such a way that the
desired opportunity of telling you had never come." He shook his head. "I tell you that it
was so, and you are bound to believe it of one of whom in all other respects you had thought
well;--of one who loved you with the fondest devotion. Instead of that there came this man
with his insidious falsehoods, with his implied lies; this man, of whom you have always thought
so badly;--and him you believed instead! I tell you that you can justify yourself before no
human being. You were not entitled to repudiate your wife for such offence as she had committed,
you are not entitled even had there been no mutual affection to bind you together. How much
less so in your present condition,--and in hers. People will only excuse you by saying that
you were mad. And now in order to put yourself right, you expect that she shall come forward,
and own herself to have been the cause of this misfortune. I tell you that she will not do
it. I would not even ask her to do it;--not for her sake, nor for your own."

"I am then to go," said he, "and grovel in the dust before her feet."

"There need be no grovelling. There need be no confessions."

"How then?"

"Go to Exeter, and simply take her. Disregard what all the world may say, for the sake of her
happiness and for your own. She will make no stipulation. She will simply throw herself into
your arms with unaffected love. Do not let her have to undergo the suffering of bringing forth
your child without the comfort of knowing that you are near to her." Then she left him to think
in solitude over the words she had spoken to him.

He did think of them. But he found it to be impossible to put absolute faith in them. It was
not that he thought that his sister was deceiving him, that he distrusted her who had taken
this long journey at great personal trouble altogether on his behalf; but that he could not
bring himself to believe that he himself had been so cruel as to reject his young wife without
adequate cause. It had gradually come across his mind that he had been most cruel, most unjust,--if
he had done so; and to this judgment, passed by himself on himself, he would not submit. In
concealing her engagement she had been very wrong, but it must be that she had concealed more
than her engagement. And to have been engaged to such a man added much to the fault in his
estimation. He would not acknowledge that she had been deceived as to the man's character and
had set herself right before it was too late. Why had the man come to his house and asked for
him,--after what had passed between them,--if not in compliance with some understanding between
him and her? But yet he would take her back if she would confess her fault and beg his pardon,--for
then he would be saved the disgrace of having to acknowledge that he had been in fault from
the first.

His sister left him alone without saying a word on the subject for twenty-four hours, and then
again attacked him. "George," she said, "I must go back to-morrow. I have left my children
all alone and cannot stay longer away from them."

"Must you go to-morrow?" he asked.

"Indeed, yes. Had not the matter been one of almost more than life and death I should not have
come. Am I to return and feel that my journey has been for nothing?"

"What would you have me do?"

"Return with me, and go at once to Exeter."

He almost tore his hair in his agony as he walked about the room before he replied to her.
But she remained silent, watching him. "You must leave me here till I think about it."

"Then I might as well not have come at all," she said.

He moved about the room in an agony of spirit. He knew it to be essential to his future happiness
in life that he should be the master in his own house. And he felt that he could not be so
unless he should be known to have been right in this terrible misfortune with which their married
life had been commenced. There was no obliterating it, no forgetting it, no ignoring it. He
had in his passion sent her away from him, and, passionately, she had withdrawn. Let them not
say a word about it, there would still have been this terrible event in both their memories.
And for himself he knew that unless it could be settled from the first that he had acted with
justice, his life would be intolerable to him. He was a man, and it behoved him to have been
just. She was a woman, and the feeling of having had to be forgiven would not be so severe
with her. She, when taken a second time into grace and pardoned, might still rejoice and be
happy. But for himself, he reminded himself over and over again that he was a man, and assured
himself that he could never lift up his head were he by his silence to admit that he had been
in the wrong.

But still his mind was changed,--was altogether changed by the coming of his sister. Till she
had come all had been a blank with him, in which no light had been possible. He could see no
life before him but one in which he should be constantly condemned by his fellow-men because
of his cruelty to his young wife. Men would not stop to ask whether he had been right or wrong,
but would declare him at any rate to have been stern and cruel. And then he had been torn to
the heart by his memory of those passages of love which had been so sweet to him. He had married
her to be the joy of his life, and she had become so to his entire satisfaction when in his
passion he had sent her away. He already knew that he had made a great mistake. Angry as he
had been, he should not have thus sought to avenge himself. He should have known himself better
than to think that because she had been in fault he could therefore live without her. He had
owned to himself when his sister had come to him that he must use her services in getting his
wife once again. Was she not the one human being that suited him at all points? But still,--but
still his honour must be saved. If she in truth desired to come back to him, she would not
hesitate to own that she had been in fault.

"What am I to say to her? What message will you send to her? You will hardly let me go back
without some word." This was said to him by his sister as he walked about the room in his misery.
What message could he send? He desired to return himself, and was willing to do so at a moment's
notice if only he could be assured that if he did so she would as a wife do her duty by owning
that she had been in the wrong. How should he live with a wife who would always be asserting
to herself, and able to assert to him, that in this extremity of their trouble he had been
the cause of it;--not that she would so assert it aloud, but that the power of doing so would
be always present to her and to him? And yet he was resolved to return, and if he allowed his
sister to go back without him never would there come so fair an opportunity again. "I have
done my duty by you," said his sister.

"Yes, yes. I need hardly tell you that I am grateful to you."

"And now do your duty by her."

"If she will write to me one line to beg me to come I will do so."

"You have absolutely driven her away from you, and left her abruptly, so that she should have
no opportunity of imploring you to spare her. And now you expect that she should do so?"

"Yes;--if she were wrong. By your own showing she was the first to sin against me."

"You do not know the nature of a woman, and especially you do not know hers. I have nothing
further to say. I shall leave this by the early train to-morrow morning, and you can go with
me or let me go alone as you please. I have said what I came to say, and if I have said it
without effect it will only show me how hard a man's heart may become by living in the world."
Then she left him alone and went her way.

He took his hat and escaped from the Hotel and walked along the Elbe all alone. He went far
down the river, and did not return for many hours. At first his thoughts were full of anger
against his sister, though he acknowledged that she had taken great trouble in coming there
on a mission intended to be beneficent to them both. With the view solely of doing her duty
to her brother and to her sister-in-law, she had taken infinite trouble; yet he was very angry
with her. Being a woman she had most unjustly taken the part of another woman against him.
Cecilia would have suffered but little in having been forced to acknowledge her great sin.
But he would suffer greatly,--he who had sinned not at all,--by the tacit confession which
he would be thus compelled to make. It was true that it was necessary that he should return.
The happiness of them all, including that unborn child, required it. His sister knowing this
demanded that he should sacrifice himself in order that his wife might be indulged in her pride.
And yet he knew that he must do it. Though he might go to her in silence, and in silence renew
his married life, he would by so doing confess that he had been wrong. To such confession he
should not be driven. In the very gall of bitterness, and with the sense of injustice strong
upon him, he did resolve that he would return to England with his sister. But having so resolved,
with his wrath hot against Lady Grant, his mind was gradually turned to Cecilia and her condition.
How sweet would it be to have her once again sitting at his table, once again leaning on his
arm, once again looking up into his face with almost comical doubt, seeking to find in his
eyes what answer he would best like her to make when referring to her for some decision. "It
is your opinion that I want," he would say. "Ah! but if I only knew yours I should be so much
better able to have one of my own." Then there would come a look over her face which almost
maddened him when he thought that he should never see it again. It was the idea that she who
could so look at him should have looked with the same smile into the face of that other man
which had driven him to fury;--that she should have so looked in those very days in which she
had gazed into his own.

Could it be that though she had been engaged to the man she had never taken delight in so gazing
at him? That girl whom he had thought to make his wife, and who had so openly jilted him, had
never understood him as Cecilia had done,--had never looked at him as Cecilia had looked. But
he, after he had been so treated,--happily so treated,--had certainly never desired ever to
see the girl. But this wife of his, who was possessed of all the charms which a woman could
own, of whom he acknowledged to himself day after day that she was, as regarded his taste,
peerless and unequalled, she after breaking from that man, that man unworthy to be called a
gentleman, still continued to hold intercourse with him! Was it not clear that she had still
remained on terms of intimacy with him?

His walk along the Elbe was very bitter, but yet he determined to return to England with his
sister.

CHAPTER XXII.

MR. WESTERN YIELDS.

The fact that Lady Grant had gone to Dresden was not long in reaching the ears of Mrs. Western.
Dick Ross had heard at the club at Perth that she had gone, and had told Sir Francis. Sir Francis
passed on the news to Miss Altifiorla, and from her it had reached the deserted wife. Miss
Altifiorla had not told it direct, because at that time she and Cecilia were not supposed to
be on friendly terms. But the tidings had got about and Mrs. Western had heard them.

"She's a good woman," said Cecilia to her mother. "I knew her to be that the first moment that
she came to me. She is rough as he is, and stern, and has a will of her own. But her heart
is tender and true;--as is his also at the core."

"I don't know about that," said Mrs. Holt, with the angry tone which she allowed herself to
use only when speaking of Mr. Western.

"Yes; he is, mamma. In your affection for me you will not allow yourself to be just to him.
In truth you hardly know him."

"I know that he has destroyed your happiness for ever, and made me very wretched."

"No, mamma; not for ever. It may be that he will come for me, and that then we shall be as
happy as the day is long." As she said this a vision came before her eyes of the birth of her
child and of her surroundings at the time;--the anxious solicitude of a loving husband, the
care of attendants who would be happy because she was happy, the congratulations of friends,
and the smiles of the world. But above all she pictured to herself her husband standing by
her bedside with the child in his arms. The dream had been dreamed before, and was re-dreamed
during every hour of the day. "Lady Grant is strong," she continued, "and can plead for me
better than I could plead myself."

"Plead for you! Why should there be anyone wanted to plead for you? Will Lady Grant plead with
you for her brother?"

"It is not necessary. My own heart pleads for him. It is because he has been in the wrong that
an intercessor is necessary for me. It is they who commit the injury that have a difficulty
in forgiving. If he came to me do you not know that I should throw myself into his arms and
be the happiest woman in the world without a word spoken?" The conversation was not then carried
further, but Mrs. Holt continued to shake her head as she sate at her knitting. In her estimation
no husband could have behaved worse than had her son-in-law. And she was of opinion that he
should be punished for his misconduct before things could be made smooth again.

Some days afterwards Miss Altifiorla called at the house, and sent in a note while she stood
waiting in the hall. In the note she merely asked whether her "dear Cecilia" would be willing
to receive her after what had passed. She had news to tell of much importance, and she hoped
that her "dear Cecilia" would receive her. There had been no absolute quarrel, no quarrel known
to the servants, and Cecilia did receive her. "Oh, my dear," she said, bustling into the room
with an air of affected importance, "you will be surprised,--I think that you must be surprised
at what I have to tell you."

"I will be surprised if you wish it," said Cecilia.

"Let me first begin by assuring you, that you must not make light of my news. It is of the
greatest importance, not only to me, but of some importance also to you."

"It shall be of importance."

"Because you begin with that little sneer which has become so common with you. You must be
aware of it. Amidst the troubles of your own life, which we all admit to be very grievous,
there has come upon you a way of thinking that no one else's affairs can be of any importance."

"I am not aware of it."

"It is so a little. And pray believe me that I am not in the least angry about it. I knew that
it would be so when I came to you this morning; and yet I could not help coming. Indeed as
the thing has now been made known to the Dean's family I could not bear that you should be
left any longer in ignorance."

"What is the thing?"

"There it is again;--that sneer. I cannot tell you unless you will interest yourself. Does
nothing interest you now beyond your own misfortunes?"

"Alas, no. I fear not."

"But this shall interest you. You must be awaked to the affairs of the world--especially such
an affair as this. You must be shaken up. This I suppose will shake you up. If not, you must
be past all hope."

"What on earth is it?"

"Sir Francis Geraldine--! You have heard at any rate of Sir Francis Geraldine."

"Well, yes; I have not as yet forgotten the name."

"I should think not. Sir Francis Geraldine has--" And then she paused again.

"Cut his little finger," said Cecilia. Had she dreamed of what was to come she would not have
turned Sir Francis into ridicule. But she had been aware of Miss Altifiorla's friendship with
Sir Francis,--or rather what she had regarded as an affectation of friendship, and did not
for a moment anticipate such a communication as was to be made to her.

"Cecilia Holt--"

"That at any rate is not my name."

"I dare say you wish it were."

"I would not change my real name for that of any woman under the sun."

"Perhaps not; but there are other women in a position of less grandeur. I am going to change mine."

"No!"

"I thought you would be surprised because it would look as though I were about to abandon my
great doctrine. It is not so. My opinions on that great subject are not in the least changed.
But of course there must be some women whom the exigencies of the world will require to marry."

"A good many, first and last."

"About the good many I do not at this moment concern myself. My duty is clearly before me and
I mean to perform it. I have been asked to ally myself--;" then there was a pause, and the
speaker discovered when it was too late that she was verging on the ridiculous in declaring
her purpose of forming an alliance;--"that is to say, I am going to marry Sir Francis Geraldine."

"Sir Francis Geraldine!"

"Do you see any just cause or impediment?"

"None in the least. And yet how am I to answer such a question? I saw cause or impediment why
I should not marry him."

"You both saw it, I suppose?" said Miss Altifiorla, with an air of grandeur. "You both supposed
that you were not made for each other, and wisely determined to give up the idea. You did not
remain single, and I suppose we need not either."

"Certainly not for my sake."

"Our intimacy since that time has been increased by circumstances, and we have now discovered
that we can both of us best suit our own interests by an--"

"An alliance," suggested Mrs. Western.

"If you please,--though I am quite aware that you use the term as a sneer." As to this Mrs.
Western was too honest to deny the truth, and remained silent.

"I thought it proper," continued Miss Altifiorla, "as we had been so long friends, to inform
you that it will be so. You had your chance, and as you let it slip I trust that you will not
envy me mine."

"Not in the least."

"At any rate you do not congratulate me."

"I have been very remiss. I acknowledge it. But upon my word the news has so startled me that
I have been unable to remember the common courtesies of the world. I thought when I heard of
your travelling up to London together that you were becoming very intimate."

"Oh, it had been ever so much before that,--the intimacy at least. Of course I did not know
him before he came to this house. But a great many things have happened since that; have there
not? Well, good-bye, dear. I have no doubt we shall continue as friends, especially as we shall
be living almost in the neighbourhood. Castle Gerald is to be at once fitted up for me, and
I hope you will forget all our little tiffs, and often come and stay with me." So saying, Miss
Altifiorla, having told her grand news, made her adieus and went away.

"A great many things have happened since that," said Cecilia, repeating to herself her friend's
words. It seemed to her to be so many that a lifetime had been wasted since Sir Francis had
first come to that house. She had won the love of the best man she had ever known, and married
him, and had then lost his love! And now she had been left as a widowed wife, with all the
coming troubles of maternity on her head. She had understood well the ill-natured sarcasm of
Miss Altifiorla. "We shall be living almost in the same neighbourhood!" Yes; if her separation
from her husband was to be continued, then undoubtedly she would live at Exeter, and, as far
as the limits of the county were concerned, she would be the neighbour of the future Lady Geraldine.
That she should ever willingly be found under the same roof with Sir Francis was, as she knew
well, as impossible to Miss Altifiorla as to herself. The invitation contained the sneer, and
was intended to contain it. But it created no anger. She, too, had sneered at Miss Altifiorla
quite as bitterly. They had each learned to despise the other, and not to sneer was impossible.
Miss Altifiorla had come to tell of her triumph, and to sneer in return. But it mattered nothing.
What did matter was whether that threat should come true. Should she always be left living
at Exeter with her mother? Then she dreamed her dream again, that he had come back to her,
and was sitting by her bedside with his hand in hers and whispering sweet words to her, while
a baby was lying in her arms--his child. As she thought of the bliss of the fancied moment,
the still possible bliss, her anger seemed to fade away. What would she not do to bring him
back, what would she not say? She had done amiss in keeping that secret so long, and though
the punishment had been severe, it was not altogether undeserved. It had come to him as a terrible
blow, and he had been unable to suppress his agony. He should not have treated her so; no,
he should not have sent her away. But she could make excuses now, which but a few weeks since
seemed to her to be impossible. And she understood, she told herself that she understood, the
difference between herself as a woman and him as a man. He had a right to command, a right
to be obeyed, a right to be master. He had a right to know all the secrets of her heart, and
to be offended when one so important had been kept from him. He had lifted his hand in great
wrath, and the blow he had struck had been awful. But she would bear it without a word of complaint
if only he would come back to her. As she thought of it, she declared to herself that she must
die if he did not come back. To live as she was living now would be impossible to her. But
if he would come back, how absolutely would she disregard all that the world might say as to
their short quarrel. It would indeed be known to all the world, but what could the world do
to her if she once again had her husband by her side? When the blow first fell on her she had
thought much of the ignominy which had befallen her, and which must ever rest with her. Even
though she should be taken back again, people would know that she had been discarded. But now
she told herself that for that she cared not at all. Then she again dreamed her dream. Her
child was born, and her husband was standing by her with that sweet manly smile upon his face.
She put out her hand as though he would touch it, and was conscious of an involuntary movement
as though she were bending her face towards him for a kiss.

Surely he would come to her! His sister had gone to him, and would have told him the absolute
truth. She had never sinned against him, even by intentional silence. There had been no thought
of hers since she had been his wife which he had not been welcome to share. It had in truth
been for his sake rather than for her own that she had been silent. She was aware that from
cowardice her silence had been prolonged. But surely now at last he would forgive her that
offence. Then she thought of the words she would use as she owned her fault. He was a man,
and as a man had a right to expect that she would confess it. If he would come to her, and
stand once again with his arm round her waist, she would confess it.

"My dear, here is a letter. The postman has just brought it." She took the letter from her
mother's hand and hardly knew whether to be pleased or disappointed when she found that the
address was in the handwriting of Lady Grant. Lady Grant would of course write whether with
good news or with bad. The address told her nothing, but yet she could not tear the envelope.
"Well, my dear; what is it?" said her mother. "Why don't you open it?"

She turned a soft supplicating painful look up to her mother's face as she begged for grace.
"I will go up-stairs, mamma, and will tell you by-and-by." Then she left the room with the
letter unopened in her hand. It was with difficulty that she could examine its contents, so
apprehensive was she and yet so hopeful, so confident at one moment of her coming happiness,
and yet so fearful at another that she should be again enveloped in the darkness of her misery.
But she did at last persuade herself to read the words which Lady Grant had written. They were
very short, and ran as follows: "My dear Cecilia, my brother returns with me, and will at once
go down to Exeter." The shock of her joy was so great that she could hardly see what followed.
"He will hope to reach that place on the fifteenth by the train which leaves London at nine
in the morning."

That was all, but that was enough. She was sure that he would not come with the purpose of
telling her that he must again leave her. And she was sure also that if he would once put himself
within the sphere of her personal influence it should be so used that he would never leave
her again.

"Of course he is coming. I knew he would come. Why should he not come?" This she exclaimed
to her mother, and then went on to speak of him with a wild rhapsody of joy, as though there
had hardly been any breach in her happiness. And she continued to sing the praises of her husband
till Mrs. Holt hardly knew how to bear her enthusiasm in a fitting mood. For she, who was not
in love, still thought that this man's conduct had been scandalous, wicked, and cruel; and,
if to be forgiven, only to be forgiven because of the general wickedness and cruelty of man.

It had not been without great difficulty that Lady Grant induced her brother to assent to her
writing the letter which has been given above. When he had agreed to return with her to England
he had no doubt assented to her assertion that he was bound to take his wife back again, even
without any confession. And this had been so much to gain, had been so felt to be the one only
material point necessary, that he was not pressed as to his manner of doing it. But before
they reached London it was essential that some arrangement should be made for bringing them
together. "Could not I go down to Durton," he had said, "and could not she come to me there?"
No doubt he might have gone to Durton, and no doubt she would have gone to him if asked. She
would have flown to him at Dresden, or to Jerusalem, at a word spoken by him. Absence had made
him so precious to her, that she would have obeyed the slightest behest with joy as long as
the order given were to bring them once more together. But of this Lady Grant was not aware,
and, had she been so, the sense of what was becoming would have restrained her.

"I think, George, that you had better go to Exeter," she said.

"Should we not be more comfortable at Durton?"

"I think that when at Durton you will be more happy if you shall yourself have fetched her
from her mother's home. I think you owe it to your wife to go to her, and make the journey
with her. What is your objection?"

"I do not wish to be seen in Exeter," he replied.

"Nor did she, you may be sure, when she returned there alone. But what does it matter? If you
can be happy in once more possessing her, it cannot signify who shall see you. There can be
nothing to be ashamed of in going for your wife; nor can any evil happen to you. As this thing
is to be done, let it be done in a noble spirit."

CHAPTER XXIII.

SIR FRANCIS' ESCAPE.

When she had told the Dean's family, and Mrs. Green, and Cecilia, Miss Altifiorla began to
feel that there was no longer a secret worth the keeping. And indeed it became necessary to
her happiness to divulge this great step in life which she was about to take. She had written
very freely, and very frequently to Sir Francis, and Sir Francis, to tell the truth, had not
responded in the same spirit. She had received but two answers to six letters, and each answer
had been conveyed in about three lines. There had been no expressions from him of confiding
love, nor any pressing demands for an immediate marriage. They had all been commenced without
even naming her, and had been finished by the simple signature of his initials. But to Miss
Altifiorla they had been satisfactory. She knew how silly she would be to expect from such
an one as her intended husband long epistles such as a school girl would require, and, in order
to keep him true to her, had determined to let him know how little exacting she was inclined
to be. She would willingly do all the preliminary writing if only she could secure her position
as Lady Geraldine. She wrote such letters, letters so full of mingled wit and love and fun,
that she was sure that he must take delight in reading them. "Easy reading requires hard writing,"
she said to herself as she copied for the third time one of her epistles, and copied it studiously
in such handwriting that it should look to have been the very work of negligence. In all this
she had been successful as she thought, and told herself over and over again how easy it was
for a clever woman to make captive a man of mark, provided that she set herself assiduously
to the task.

She soon descended from her friends to the shopkeepers, and found that her news was received
very graciously by the mercantile interests of the city. The milliners, the haberdashers, the
furriers and the bootmakers of Exeter received her communication and her orders with pleased
alacrity. With each of them she held a little secret conference, telling each with a smiling
whisper what fate was about to do for her. To even the upholsterers, the bankers, the hotel-keepers
and the owners of post-horses she was communicative, making every one the gratified recipient
of her tidings. Thus in a short time all Exeter knew that Sir Francis Geraldine was about to
lead to the hymeneal altar Miss Altifiorla, and it must be acknowledged that all Exeter expressed
various opinions on the subject. They who understood that Miss Altifiorla was to pay for the
supplies ordered out of her own pocket declared for the most part how happy a man was Sir Francis.
But those who could only look to Sir Francis for possible future custom were surprised that
the Baronet should have allowed himself to be so easily caught. And then the aristocracy expressed
its opinion which it must be acknowledged was for the most part hostile to Miss Altifiorla.
It was well known through the city that the Dean had declared that he would never again see
his brother-in-law at the deanery. And it was whispered that the Reverend Dr. Pigrum, one of
the canons, had stated "that no one in the least knew where Miss Altifiorla had come from."
This hit Miss Altifiorla very hard,--so much so, that she felt herself obliged to write an
indignant letter to Dr. Pigrum, giving at length her entire pedigree. To this Dr. Pigrum made
a reply as follows: "Dr. Pigrum's compliments to Miss Altifiorla, and is happy to learn the
name of her great grandmother." Dr. Pigrum was supposed to be a wag, and the letter soon became
the joint property of all the ladies in the Close.

This interfered much with Miss Altifiorla's happiness. She even went across to Cecilia, complaining
of the great injustice done to her by the Cathedral clergymen generally. "Men from whom one
should expect charity instead of scandal, but that their provincial ignorance is so narrow!"
Then she went on to remind Cecilia how much older was the Roman branch of her family than even
the blood of the Geraldines. "You oughtn't to have talked about it," said Cecilia, who in her
present state of joy did not much mind Miss Altifiorla and her husband. "Do you suppose that
I intend to be married under a bushel?" said Miss Altifiorla grandly. But this little episode
only tended to renew the feeling of enmity between the ladies.

But there appeared a paragraph in the "Western Telegraph" which drove Miss Altifiorla nearly
mad: "It is understood that one of the aristocracy in this county is soon about to be married
to a lady who has long lived among us in Exeter. Sir Francis Geraldine is the happy man, and
Miss Altifiorla is the lady about to become Lady Geraldine. Miss Altifiorla is descended from
an Italian family of considerable note in its own country. Her great grandmother was a Fiasco,
and her great great grandmother a Disgrazia. We are delighted to find that Sir Francis is to
ally himself to a lady of such high birth." Now Miss Altifiorla was well aware that there was
an old feud between Sir Francis and the "Western Telegraph," and she observed also that the
paper made allusion to the very same relatives whom she had named in her unfortunate letter
to Dr. Pigrum. "The vulgarity of the people of this town is quite unbearable," she exclaimed
to Mrs. Green. But when she was left alone she at once wrote a funnier letter than ever to
Sir Francis. It might be that Sir Francis should not see the paragraph. At any rate she did
not mention it.

But unfortunately Sir Francis did see the paragraph; and, unfortunately also, he had not appreciated
the wit of Miss Altifiorla's letters. "Oh, laws!" he had been heard to ejaculate on receipt
of a former letter.

"It's the kind of thing a man has to put up with when he gets married," said Captain McCollop,
a gentleman who had already in some sort succeeded Dick Ross.

"I don't suppose you think a man ever ought to be married."

"Quite the contrary. When a man has a property he must be married. I suppose I shall have the
McCollop acres some of these days myself." The McCollop acres were said to lie somewhere in
Caithness, but no one knew their exact locality. "But a man will naturally put off the evil
day as long as he can. I should have thought that you might have allowed yourself to run another
five years yet." The flattery did touch Sir Francis, and he began to ask himself whether he
had gone too far with Miss Altifiorla. Then came the "Western Telegraph," and he told himself
that he had gone too far.

"By G----, she has told everybody in that beastly hole," said he. The "beastly hole" was intended
to represent Exeter.

"Of course she has. You didn't suppose but that she would begin to wear her honour and glory
as soon as they were wearable."

"She pledged herself not to mention it to a single soul," said Sir Francis. Upon this Captain
McCollop merely shrugged his shoulders. "I'm d----d if I put up with it. Look here! All her
filthy progenitors put into the newspaper to show how grand she is."

"I shouldn't care so very much about that," said the cautious Captain, who began to perceive
that he need not be specially bitter against the lady.

"You're not going to marry her."

"Well, no; that's true."

"Nor am I," said Sir Francis with an air of great decision. "She hasn't got a word of mine
in writing to show,--not a word that would go for anything with a jury."

"Hasn't she indeed?"

"Not a word. I have taken precious good care of that. Between you and me, I don't mind acknowledging
it. But it had never come to more than that."

"Then in fact you are not bound to her."

"No; I am not;--not what I call bound. She's a handsome woman you know,--very handsome."

"I suppose so."

"And she'd do the drawing-room well, and the sitting at the top of the table, and all that
kind of thing."

"But it's such a deuced heavy price to pay," said Captain McCollop.

"I should not have minded the price," said Sir Francis, not quite understanding his friend's
remark, "if she hadn't made me ridiculous in this way. The Fiascos and the Disgrazias! What
the devil are they to our old English families? If she had let it remain as it was, I might
have gone through with it. But as she has told all Exeter and got that stuff put into the newspapers,
she must take the consequences. One is worse than another, as far as I can see." By this Sir
Francis intended to express his opinion that Miss Altifiorla was at any rate quite as bad as
Cecilia Holt.

But the next thing to be decided was the mode of escape. Though Sir Francis had declared that
he was not what he called bound, yet he knew that he must take some steps in the matter to
show that he considered himself to be free; and as the Captain was a clever man, and well conversant
with such things, he was consulted. "I should say, take a run abroad for a short time," said
the Captain.

"Is that necessary?"

"You'd avoid some of the disagreeables. People will talk, and your relatives at Exeter might
kick up a row."

"Oh, d---- my relatives."

"With all my heart. But people have such a way of making themselves disgusting. What do you
say to taking a run through the States?"

"Would you go with me?" asked the Baronet.

"If you wish it I shouldn't mind," said the Captain considerately. "Only to do any good we
should be off quickly. But you must write to some one first."

"Before I start, you think?"

"Oh, yes;--certainly. If she didn't hear from you before you went, you'd be persecuted by her
letters."

"There is no end to her letters. I've quite made up my mind what I'll do about them. I won't
open one of them. After all, why should she write to me when the affair is over? You've heard
of Mrs. Western, I suppose?"

"Yes; I've heard of her."

"I didn't write to her when that affair was over. I didn't pester her with long-winded scrawls.
She changed her mind, and I've changed mine; and so we're equal. I've paid her, and she can
pay me if she knows how."

"I hope Miss Altifiorla will look at it in the same light," said the Captain.

"Why shouldn't she? She knew all about it when that other affair came to an end. I wasn't treated
with any particular ceremony. The truth is, people don't look at these things now as they used
to do. Men and women mostly do as they like till they've absolutely fixed themselves. There
used to be duels and all that kind of nonsense. There is none of that now."

"No; you won't get shot."

"I don't mind being shot any more than another man; but you must take the world as you find
it. One young woman treated me awfully rough, to tell the truth. And why am I not to treat
another just as roughly? If you look at it all round, you'll see that I have used them just
as they have used me."

"At any rate," said Captain McCollop, after a pause, "if you have made up your mind, you'd
better write the letter."

Sir Francis did not see the expediency of writing the letter immediately, but at last he gave
way to his friend's arguments. And he did so the more readily as his friend was there to write
the letter for him. After some attempts on his own part, he put the writing of the letter into
the hands of the Captain, and left him alone for an entire morning to perform the task. The
letter when it was sent, after many corrections and revises, ran as follows:--

   MY DEAR MISS ALTIFIORLA,--I think that I am bound in
   honour without a moment's delay to make you aware of the
   condition of my mind in regard to marriage. I ain't quite
   sure but what I shall be better without it altogether.--

"I'd rather marry her twice over than let my cousin have the title and the property," said
the Baronet with energy. "You needn't tell her that," said McCollop. "Of course when you've
cleared the ground in this quarter you can begin again with another lady."

   --I think that perhaps I may have expressed myself badly
   so as to warrant you in understanding more than I have
   meant. If so, I am sure the fault has been mine, and I am
   very sorry for it. Things have turned up with which I need
   not perhaps trouble you, and compel me to go for a while
   to a very distant country. I shall be off almost before
   I can receive a reply to this letter. Indeed, I may be
   gone before an answer can reach me. But I have thought it
   right not to let a post go by without informing you of my
   decision.

   I have seen that article in the Exeter newspaper
   respecting your family in Italy, and think that it must
   be very gratifying to you. I did understand, however,
   that not a word was to have been spoken as to the matter.
   Nothing had escaped from me, at any rate. I fear that
   some of your intimate friends at Exeter must have been
   indiscreet.

   Believe me yours,
   With the most sincere admiration,

   FRANCIS GERALDINE.

He was not able to start for America immediately after writing this, but he quitted his Lodge
in Scotland, leaving no immediate address, and hid himself for a while among his London clubs,
where he trusted that the lady might not find him. In a week's time he would be off to the
United States.

Who shall picture the rage of Miss Altifiorla when she received this letter? This was the very
danger which she had feared, but had hardly thought it worth her while to fear. It was the
one possible break-down in her triumph; but had been, she thought, so unlikely as to be hardly
possible. But now on reading the letter she felt that no redress was within her reach. To whom
should she go for succour? Though her ancestors had been so noble, she had no one near her
to take up the cudgels on her behalf. With her friends in Exeter she had become a little proud
of late, so that she had turned from her those who might have assisted her. "The coward!" she
said to herself, "the base coward! He dares to treat me in this way because he knows that I
am alone." Then she became angry in her heart against Cecilia, who she felt had set a dangerous
example in this practice of jilting. Had Cecilia not treated Sir Francis so unceremoniously
he certainly would not have dared so to treat her. There was truth in this, as in that case
Sir Francis would at this moment have been the husband of Mrs. Western.

But what should she do? She took out every scrap of letter that she had received from the man,
and read each scrap with the greatest care. In the one letter there certainly was an offer
very plainly made, as he had intended it; but she doubted whether she could depend upon it
in a court of law. "Don't you think that you and I know each other well enough to make a match
of it?" It was certainly written as an offer, and her two answers to him would make it plain
that it was so. But she had an idea that she would not be allowed to use her own letters against
him. And then to have her gushing words read as a reply to so cold a proposition would be death
to her. There was not another syllable in the whole correspondence written by him to signify
that he had in truth intended to become her husband. She felt sure that he had been wickedly
crafty in the whole matter, and had lured her on to expose herself in her innocence.

But what should she do? Should she write to him an epistle full of tenderness? She felt sure
that it would be altogether ineffectual. Should she fill sheets with indignation? It would
be of no use unless she could follow up her indignation by strong measures. Should she let
the thing pass by in silence, as though she and Sir Francis had never known each other? She
would certainly do so, but that she had allowed her matrimonial prospects to become common
through all Exeter. She must also let Exeter know how badly Sir Francis intended to treat her.
To her, too, the idea of a prolonged sojourn in the United States presented itself. In former
days there had come upon her a great longing to lecture at Chicago, at Saint Paul's, and Omaha,
on the distinctive duties of the female sex. Now again the idea returned to her. She thought
that in one of those large Western halls, full of gas and intelligence, she could rise to the
height of her subject with a tremendous eloquence. But then would not the name of Sir Francis
travel with her and crush her?

She did resolve upon informing Mrs. Green. She took three days to think of it, and then she
sent for Mrs. Green. "Of all human beings," she said, "you, I think, are the truest to me."
Mrs. Green of course expressed herself as much flattered. "And therefore I will tell you. No
false pride shall operate with me to make me hold my tongue. Of all the false deceivers that
have ever broken a woman's heart, that man is the basest and the falsest."

In this way she let all Exeter know that she was not to be married to Sir Francis Geraldine;
and another paragraph appeared in the "Western Telegraph," declaring that after all Sir Francis
Geraldine was not to be allied to the Fiascos and Disgrazias of Rome.

CHAPTER XXIV.

CONCLUSION.

Though the news of Miss Altifiorla's broken engagement did reach Mrs. Western at St. David's,
she was in a state of mind which prevented her almost from recognising the fact. It was the
very day on which her husband was to come to her. And her joy was so extreme as almost to have
become painful. "Mamma," she said, "I shall not know what to say to him."

"Just let him come and receive him quietly."

"Receive him quietly! How can I be quiet when he will have come back to me? I think you do
not realise the condition I have been in during the last three months."

"Yes, my dear, I do. You have been deserted, and it has been very bad."

But Mrs. Western did not approve of the word used, as it carried a strong reproach against
her husband. She was anxious now to take upon herself the whole weight of the fault which had
produced their separation, and to hold him to have been altogether sinless. And as yet she
was not quite sure that he would again take her to his home. All she knew was that he would
be that day in Exeter, and that then so much might depend on her own conduct. Of this she was
quite sure,--that were he to reject her she must die. In her present condition, and with the
memory present to her of the dreams she had dreamed, she could not live alone at Exeter, divided
from him, and there give birth to her child. But he must surely intend to take her into his
arms when he should arrive. It could not be possible that he should again reject her when he
had once seen her.

Then she became fidgety about her personal appearance,--a female frailty which had never much
prevailed with her,--and was anxious even about her ribbons and her dress. "He does think so
much about a woman being neat," she said to her mother.

"I never perceived it in him, my dear."

"Because you have not known him as I have done. He does not say much, but no one's eye is so
accurate and so severe." All this arose from a certain passage which dwelt in her remembrance,
when he had praised the fit of her gown, and had told her with a kiss that no woman ever dressed
so well as she did.

"I think, my dear," continued Mrs. Holt, "that if you wear your black silk just simply, it
will do very well."

Simply! Yes; she must certainly be simple. But it is so hard to be simple in such a way as
to please a man's eye. And yet, even when the time came near, she did not dare to remain long
in her bedroom lest her own maid should know the source of her anxiety. At one time she had
declared that she would go down to the station to meet him, but that idea had been soon abandoned.
The first kiss she would give him should not be seen by strangers.

But if she were perplexed as to how she would bear herself on the coming occasion he was much
more so. It may be said of him, that through his whole journey home from Dresden he was disturbed,
unhappy, and silent. And that when his sister left him in London, and that he had nothing immediately
before him but the journey down to Exeter, he was almost overwhelmed by the difficulties of
the situation. His case as a man was so much worse than hers as a woman. The speaking must
all be done by him, and what was there that he could say? There was still present to him a
keen sense of the wrong that he had endured; though he owned to himself that the punishment
which at the spur of the moment he had resolved upon inflicting was too severe,--both upon
her and upon himself. And though he felt that he had been injured, he did gradually acknowledge
that he had believed something worse than the truth. How to read the riddle he did not know,
but there was a riddle which he had not read aright. If Cecilia should still be silent, he
must still be left in the dark. But he did understand that he was to expect no confession of
a fault, and that he was to exact no show of repentance.

When the train arrived at Exeter he determined to be driven at once to the Hotel. It made him
unhappy to think that everyone around him should be aware that he was occupying rooms at an
inn while his wife was living in the town; but he did not dare to take his portmanteau to Mrs.
Holt's house and hang up his hat in her hall as though nothing had been the matter. "Put it
into a cab," he said to a porter as the door was opened, "and bid him drive to the Clarence."

But a man whose face he remembered had laid his hand upon his valise before it was well out
of the railway carriage. "Please, Sir," said the man, "you are to go up to the house, and I'm
to carry your things. I am Sam Barnet, the gardener."

"Very well, Sam," said Mr. Western. "Go on and I'll follow you." Now, as he well knew, the
house at St. David's was less than half a mile from the railway station.

He felt that his misery would be over in ten minutes, and yet for ten minutes how miserable
a man he was! Whilst she was trembling with joy, a joy that was only dashed by a vague fear
of his possible sternness, he was blaming his fate as it shortened by every step the distance
between him and his wife. At last he had entered the path of the little garden, and the door
of the house was open before him. He ventured to look, but did not see her. He was in the hall,
but yet he did not see her. "Cecilia is in the breakfast parlour," said the voice of Mrs. Holt,
whom in his confusion he did not notice. The breakfast parlour was in the back part of the
house, looking out into the garden, and thither he went. The door was just ajar and he passed
in. In a second the whole trouble was over. She was in his arms at once, kissing his face,
stroking his hair, leaning on his bosom, holding his arm round her own waist as though to make
sure that he should not leave her; crying and laughing at the same moment. "Oh, George, my
own George! It has all been my doing; but you will forgive me! Say that one word that I am
'forgiven.'" Then there came another storm of kisses which frustrated the possibility of his
speaking to her.

What a wife she was to possess! How graceful, how gracious, how precious were her charms,--charms
in which no other woman surely ever approached her! How warm and yet how cool was the touch
of her lips; how absolutely symmetrical was the sweet curve of her bust; what a fragrance came
from her breath! And the light of her eyes, made more bright by her tears, shone into his with
a heavenly brightness. Her soft hair as he touched it filled him with joy. And once more she
was all his own. Let the secret be what it might, he was quite sure that she was his own. As
he bent down over her she pressed her cheek against his and again drew his arm tighter round
her waist. "George, if you wished to know how I love you, you have taken the right step. I
have been sick for you, but now I shall be sick no longer. Oh, George, it was my fault; but
say that you have forgiven me."

He could not bring himself to speak so much of an accusation as would be contained in that
word "forgive." How was he to pardon one whose present treatment to him was so perfect, so
loving, and so lovely? "Sit down, George, and let me tell you how it was. Of course I was wrong,
but I did not mean to be wrong."

"No, no," he said. "There shall be no wrong." And yet why had not his sister told him that
it would be like this? Why had she so stoutly maintained that Cecilia would confess nothing.
Here she was acknowledging everything with most profuse confession. What could any man desire
more? "Do not speak of it;--at any rate now. Let me be happy as I have got you."

Then there was another storm of kisses, but she was not to be put off from her purpose. "You
must know it all. Sit down;--there, like that." And she seated herself, leaning back upon him
on the sofa. "Before we had been abroad I had been engaged to that man."

"Yes;--I understand that."

"I had been engaged to him,--without knowing him. Then when I found that he was not what I
thought him, I made up my mind that it would be better to throw him over than make us both
miserable for life."

"Certainly."

"And I did so. I made a struggle and did it. From that time to this I have had nothing to say
to him,--nor he to me. You may say that I treated him badly."

"I don't say so. I, at any rate, do not say so."

"My own, own man. Then we went abroad, and as good fortune would have it you came in our way.
It was not long before you made me love you. That was not my fault, George. I loved you so
dearly when you were telling me that story about the other girl;--but, somehow, I could not
tell you then a similar story about myself. It seemed at first so odd that my story should
be the same, and then it looked almost as though I were mocking you. Had you had no story to
tell, you would have known all my own before I had allowed myself to be made happy by your
love. Do you not perceive that it was so?"

"Yes," he said, slowly, "I can understand what you mean."

"But it was a mistake; for from day to day the difficulty grew upon me, and when once there
was a difficulty, I was not strong enough to overcome it. There never came the moment in which
I was willing to mar my own happiness by telling you that which I thought would wound yours.
I had not dreamed beforehand how much more difficult it would become when I should once be
absolutely your wife. Then your sister came and she told me. She is better than anybody in
the world except yourself."

"All women are better than I am," he said. "It is their nature to be so."

Some half-ludicrous idea of Miss Altifiorla and her present difficulties came across her mind,
as she contradicted his assertion with another shower of kisses. "She told me," continued Cecilia,
"that I was bound to let you know all the truth. Of course I knew that; of course I intended
it. But that odious woman was in the house, and I could not tell you till she was gone. Then
he came."

"Why did he come?"

"He had no right to come. No man with the smallest spirit would have shown himself at your
door. I have thought about it again and again, and I can only imagine that it has been his
intention to revenge himself. But what matter his intentions so long as they do not come between
you and me? I want you to know all the truth, but not to imagine more than the truth. Since
the day on which I had told him that he and I must part, there has been no communication between
us but what you know. He came to Durton and made his way into the house, and Miss Altifiorla
was there and saw it all; and then you were told."

"He is a mean brute."

"But I am not a brute. Am I a brute? Say that I am nice once more. You know everything now,--everything,
everything. I do own that I have been wrong to conceal it. My very soul should be laid bare
to you."

"Cecilia, I will never be hard to you again."

"I do not say that you have been hard. I do not accuse you. I know that I have been wrong,
and I am quite content that we should again be friends. Oh, George, just at this moment I think
it is sweeter than if you had never sent me away."

And so the reconciliation was made, and Mr. Western and Cecilia were once more together. But
no doubt to her mind, as she thought of it all, there was present the happy conviction that
she had been more sinned against than sinning. She had forgiven, whereas she might have exacted
forgiveness. She had been gracious, whereas she might have followed her mother's advice and
have been repellent till she had brought him to her feet. As it was, her strong desire to have
him once again had softened her, and now she had the double reward. She had what she wanted,
and was able to congratulate herself at the same time on her virtue. But he, though he had
too what he wanted, became gradually aware that he had been cruel, stiff-necked, and obdurate. Between
the complex with the last two tract, what belong therefore and were together charmingly understand,
come a book of 1875, bearing the friend three northern Love Narrative and great Words. Complement
will dare frithiof love of a woman, and that is how the sagaman disk
whose hate at all.

These tales whom are so told in the translation in Morris and Magnusson,
the moment, "much is the good," being a seigneur-part in its kind.

Him is as other content of Iceland would to make in the love-tearjerker two
class.
 He
would have called on Miss Altifiorla had he not understood that Miss Altifiorla in her present
state of mind received no visitors. She gave it out that since men had been men and women had
been women, no woman had been so basely injured as herself. But she intended to redress the
wrongs of her sex by a great movement, and was devoting herself at present to hard study with
that object. She used to be seen daily walking two miles and back on the Crediton Road, it
being necessary to preserve her health for the sake of the great work she had in hand. But
it was understood that no one was to accost her, or speak to her on these occasions, and at
other times it was well known that she was engaged upon the labours of her task.

"And to-morrow we will go back to Durton," said Mr. Western to his wife.

"Dear Durton, how happy I shall be to see it once again!"

"And how happy I shall be to take you again to see it! But before we go it is necessary that
I should say one thing."

This he spoke in so stern a voice that he almost frightened her. Was it possible that after
all he should find it necessary to refer again to the little fault which she had so cordially
avowed?

"What is it, George?"

"I have made a mistake."

"No, George, no, don't say so. There has been no mistake. A man should own nothing. I have
thought about it and am sure of it."

"Let a man commit no fault, and then what you say will be true. I made a mistake, and allowed
myself to be so governed by it as to commit a great injustice. I am aware of it, and I trust
I may never repeat it. Such a mistake as that I think that I shall never commit again. But
I did it, and I ask you to forgive me." In answer to this she could only embrace him and hang
upon him, and implore him in silence to spare her. "So it has been, and I ask your pardon."

"No, George, no; no."

"Will you not pardon me when I ask you?"

"I cannot bring myself to say such a word. You know that it is all right between us. I cannot
speak the word which you shall never be made to hear. I am the happiest woman now in all England,
and you must not force me to say that which shall in any way lessen my glory."
