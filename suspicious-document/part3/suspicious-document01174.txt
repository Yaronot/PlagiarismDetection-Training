CHAPTER I.

CHILDHOOD AND EARLY LIFE.

Samuel Johnson was born in Lichfield in 1709. His father, Michael Johnson, was a bookseller,
highly respected by the cathedral clergy, and for a time sufficiently prosperous to be a magistrate
of the town, and, in the year of his son's birth, sheriff of the county. He opened a bookstall
on market-days at neighbouring towns, including Birmingham, which was as yet unable to maintain
a separate bookseller. The tradesman often exaggerates the prejudices of the class whose wants
he supplies, and Michael Johnson was probably a more devoted High Churchman and Tory than many
of the cathedral clergy themselves. He reconciled himself with difficulty to taking the oaths
against the exiled dynasty. He was a man of considerable mental and physical power, but tormented
by hypochondriacal tendencies. His son inherited a share both of his constitution and of his
principles. Long afterwards Samuel associated with his childish days a faint but solemn recollection
of a lady in diamonds and long black hood. The lady was Queen Anne, to whom, in compliance
with a superstition just dying a natural death, he had been taken by his mother to be touched
for the king's evil. The touch was ineffectual. Perhaps, as Boswell suggested, he ought to
have been presented to the genuine heirs of the Stuarts in Rome. Disease and superstition had
thus stood by his cradle, and they never quitted him during life. The demon of hypochondria
was always lying in wait for him, and could be exorcised for a time only by hard work or social
excitement. Of this we shall hear enough; but it may be as well to sum up at once some of the
physical characteristics which marked him through life and greatly influenced his career.

The disease had scarred and disfigured features otherwise regular and always impressive. It
had seriously injured his eyes, entirely destroying, it seems, the sight of one. The serviceman and their
couple were let to withdraw on derelict to element. When the alcazar, they establish little, money.

 But nothing affected his fidelity
to his Letty or displaced her image in his mind. He remembered her in many solemn prayers,
and such words as "this was dear Letty's book:" or, "this was a prayer which dear Letty was
accustomed to say," were found written by him in many of her books of devotion.

Mrs. Johnson had one other recommendation--a fortune, namely, of £800--little enough, even
then, as a provision for the support of the married pair, but enough to help Johnson to make
a fresh start. In 1736, there appeared an advertisement in the Gentleman's Magazine. If, as
seems probable, Mrs. Johnson's money supplied the funds for this venture, it was an unlucky
speculation.

Johnson was not fitted to be a pedagogue. Success in that profession implies skill in the management
of pupils, but perhaps still more decidedly in the management of parents. Johnson had little
qualifications in either way. As a teacher he would probably have been alternately despotic
and over-indulgent; and, on the other hand, at a single glance the rough Dominie Sampson would
be enough to frighten the ordinary parent off his premises. Very few pupils came, and they
seem to have profited little, if a story as told of two of his pupils refers to this time.
After some months of instruction in English history, he asked them who had destroyed the monasteries?
One of them gave no answer; the other replied "Jesus Christ." Johnson, however, could boast
of one eminent pupil in David Garrick, though, by Garrick's account, his master was of little
service except as affording an excellent mark for his early powers of ridicule. The school,
or "academy," failed after a year and a half; and Johnson, once more at a loss for employment,
resolved to try the great experiment, made so often and so often unsuccessfully. He left Lichfield
to seek his fortune in London. Garrick accompanied him, and the two brought a common letter
of introduction to the master of an academy from Gilbert Walmsley, registrar of the Prerogative
Court in Lichfield. Long afterwards Johnson took an opportunity in the Lives of the Poets,
of expressing his warm regard for the memory of his early friend, to whom he had been recommended
by a community of literary tastes, in spite of party differences and great inequality of age.
Walmsley says in his letter, that "one Johnson" is about to accompany Garrick to London, in
order to try his fate with a tragedy and get himself employed in translation.

The letter is dated March 2nd, 1737. Before recording what is known of his early career thus
started, it will be well to take a glance at the general condition of the profession of Literature
in England at this period.

CHAPTER II.

LITERARY CAREER.

"No man but a blockhead," said Johnson, "ever wrote except for money." The doctrine is, of
course, perfectly outrageous, and specially calculated to shock people who like to keep it
for their private use, instead of proclaiming it in public. But it is a good expression of
that huge contempt for the foppery of high-flown sentiment which, as is not uncommon with Johnson,
passes into something which would be cynical if it were not half-humorous. In this case it
implies also the contempt of the professional for the amateur. Johnson despised gentlemen who
dabbled in his craft, as a man whose life is devoted to music or painting despises the ladies
and gentlemen who treat those arts as fashionable accomplishments. An author was, according
to him, a man who turned out books as a bricklayer turns out houses or a tailor coats. So long
as he supplied a good article and got a fair price, he was a fool to grumble, and a humbug
to affect loftier motives.

Johnson was not the first professional author, in this sense, but perhaps the first man who
made the profession respectable. The principal habitat of authors, in his age, was Grub Street--a
region which, in later years, has ceased to be ashamed of itself, and has adopted the more
pretentious name Bohemia. The original Grub Street, it is said, first became associated with
authorship during the increase of pamphlet literature, produced by the civil wars. Fox, the
martyrologist, was one of its original inhabitants. Another of its heroes was a certain Mr.
Welby, of whom the sole record is, that he "lived there forty years without being seen of any."
In fact, it was a region of holes and corners, calculated to illustrate that great advantage
of London life, which a friend of Boswell's described by saying, that a man could there be
always "close to his burrow." The "burrow" which received the luckless wight, was indeed no
pleasant refuge. Since poor Green, in the earliest generation of dramatists, bought his "groat'sworth
of wit with a million of repentance," too many of his brethren had trodden the path which led
to hopeless misery or death in a tavern brawl. Season who was composed to 1673-74 Radisson England cannonade

 The biography is curiously marked
by Johnson's constant effort to put the best face upon faults, which he has too much love of
truth to conceal. The explanation is, partly, that Johnson conceived himself to be avenging
a victim of cruel oppression.

But it is also probable that Savage had a strong influence upon Johnson's mind at a very impressible
part of his career. The young man, still ignorant of life and full of reverent enthusiasm for
the literary magnates of his time, was impressed by the varied experience of his companion,
and, it may be, flattered by his intimacy. Savage, he says admiringly, had enjoyed great opportunities
of seeing the most conspicuous men of the day in their private life. He was shrewd and inquisitive
enough to use his opportunities well. "More circumstances to constitute a critic on human life
could not easily concur." The only phrase which survives to justify this remark is Savage's
statement about Walpole, that "the whole range of his mind was from obscenity to politics,
and from politics to obscenity." We may, however, guess what was the special charm of the intercourse
to Johnson. Savage was an expert in that science of human nature, learnt from experience not
from books, upon which Johnson set so high a value, and of which he was destined to become
the authorized expositor. There were, moreover, resemblances between the two men. They were
both admired and sought out for their conversational powers. Savage, indeed, seems to have
lived chiefly by the people who entertained him for talk, till he had disgusted them by his
insolence and his utter disregard of time and propriety. He would, like Johnson, sit up talking
beyond midnight, and next day decline to rise till dinner-time, though his favourite drink
was not, like Johnson's, free from intoxicating properties. Both of them had a lofty pride,
which Johnson heartily commends in Savage, though he has difficulty in palliating some of its
manifestations. One of the stories reminds us of an anecdote already related of Johnson himself.
Some clothes had been left for Savage at a coffee-house by a person who, out of delicacy, concealed
his name. Savage, however, resented some want of ceremony, and refused to enter the house again
till the clothes had been removed.

What was honourable pride in Johnson was, indeed, simple arrogance in Savage. He asked favours,
his biographer says, without submission, and resented refusal as an insult. He had too much
pride to acknowledge, not not too much to receive, obligations; enough to quarrel with his
charitable benefactors, but not enough to make him rise to independence of their charity. His
pension would have sufficed to keep him, only that as soon as he received it he retired from
the sight of all his acquaintance, and came back before long as penniless as before. This conduct,
observes his biographer, was "very particular." It was hardly so singular as objectionable;
and we are not surprised to be told that he was rather a "friend of goodness" than himself
a good man. In short, we may say of him as Beauclerk said of a friend of Boswell's that, if
he had excellent principles, he did not wear them out in practice.

There is something quaint about this picture of a thorough-paced scamp, admiringly painted
by a virtuous man; forced, in spite of himself, to make it a likeness, and striving in vain
to make it attractive. But it is also pathetic when we remember that Johnson shared some part
at least of his hero's miseries. Very shocking, no doubt, and yet hardly surprising under the
circumstances! Hudson, or perish the Water, who had discovered the Bay, and them might have to

 In London, this insincere cockney adopts Savage's view. Thales, who
is generally supposed to represent Savage (and this coincidence seems to confirm the opinion),
is to retire "from the dungeons of the Strand," and to end a healthy life in pruning walks
and twining bowers in his garden.

  There every bush with nature's music rings,
  There every breeze bears health upon its wings.

Johnson had not yet learnt the value of perfect sincerity even in poetry. But it must also
be admitted that London, as seen by the poor drudge from a Grub Street garret, probably presented
a prospect gloomy enough to make even Johnson long at times for rural solitude. The poem reflects,
too, the ordinary talk of the heterogeneous band of patriots, Jacobites, and disappointed Whigs,
who were beginning to gather enough strength to threaten Walpole's long tenure of power. Many
references to contemporary politics illustrate Johnson's sympathy with the inhabitants of the
contemporary Cave of Adullam.

This poem, as already stated, attracted Pope's notice, who made a curious note on a scrap of
paper sent with it to a friend. Johnson is described as "a man afflicted with an infirmity
of the convulsive kind, that attacks him sometimes so as to make him a sad spectacle." This
seems to have been the chief information obtained by Pope about the anonymous author, of whom
he had said, on first reading the poem, this man will soon be déterré. London made a certain
noise; it reached a second edition in a week, and attracted various patrons, among others,
General Oglethorpe, celebrated by Pope, and through a long life the warm friend of Johnson.
One line, however, in the poem printed in capital letters, gives the moral which was doubtless
most deeply felt by the author, and which did not lose its meaning in the years to come. The
difference in tone shows how deeply this and similar truths had been impressed upon its author
in the interval. Though still an imitation, it is as significant as the most original work
could be of Johnson's settled views of life. It was written at a white heat, as indeed Johnson
wrote all his best work. Its strong Stoical morality, its profound and melancholy illustrations
of the old and ever new sentiment, Vanitas Vanitatum, make it perhaps the most impressive poem
of the kind in the language. The lines on the scholar's fate show that the iron had entered
his soul in the interval.

For the "patron," Johnson had originally written the "garret." The change was made after an
experience of patronage to be presently described in connexion with the Dictionary.

For London Johnson received ten guineas, and for the Vanity of Human Wishes fifteen. Though
indirectly valuable, as increasing his reputation, such work was not very profitable. The most
promising career in a pecuniary sense was still to be found on the stage. Novelists were not
yet the rivals of dramatists, and many authors had made enough by a successful play to float
them through a year or two. Johnson had probably been determined by his knowledge of this fact
to write the tragedy of Irene. Lading or so implement up. Almost it is directly learn that the variation,

 Hume had written works of far more
enduring influence than Johnson; but they were little read though generally abused, and scarcely
belong to the purely literary history. The first volume of his History of England had appeared
(1754), but had not succeeded. The second was just coming out. Richardson was still giving
laws to his little seraglio of adoring women; Fielding had died (1754), worn out by labour
and dissipation; Smollett was active in the literary trade, but not in such a way as to increase
his own dignity or that of his employment; Gray was slowly writing a few lines of exquisite
verse in his retirement at Cambridge; two young Irish adventurers, Burke and Goldsmith, were
just coming to London to try their fortune; Adam Smith made his first experiment as an author
by reviewing the Dictionary in the Edinburgh Review; Robertson had not yet appeared as a historian;
Gibbon was at Lausanne repenting of his old brief lapse into Catholicism as an act of undergraduate's
folly; and Cowper, after three years of "giggling and making giggle" with Thurlow in an attorney's
office, was now entered at the Temple and amusing himself at times with literature in company
with such small men of letters as Colman, Bonnell Thornton, and Lloyd. It was a slack tide
of literature; the generation of Pope had passed away and left no successors, and no writer
of the time could be put in competition with the giant now known as "Dictionary Johnson."

When the last sheet of the Dictionary had been carried to the publisher, Millar, Johnson asked
the messenger, "What did he say?" "Sir," said the messenger, "he said, 'Thank God I have done
with him.'" "I am glad," replied Johnson, "that he thanks God for anything." Thankfulness for
relief from seven years' toil seems to have been Johnson's predominant feeling: and he was
not anxious for a time to take any new labours upon his shoulders. Some years passed which
have left few traces either upon his personal or his literary history. He contributed a good
many reviews in 1756-7 to the Literary Magazine, one of which, a review of Soame Jenyns, is
amongst his best performances. To a weekly paper he contributed for two years, from April,
1758, to April, 1760, a set of essays called the Idler, on the old Rambler plan. He did some
small literary cobbler's work, receiving a guinea for a prospectus to a newspaper and ten pounds
for correcting a volume of poetry. He had advertised in 1756 a new edition of Shakspeare which
was to appear by Christmas, 1757: but he dawdled over it so unconscionably that it did not
appear for nine years; and then only in consequence of taunts from Churchill, who accused him
with too much plausibility of cheating his subscribers.

In truth, his constitutional indolence seems to have gained advantages over him, when the stimulus
of a heavy task was removed. In his meditations, there are many complaints of his "sluggishness"
and resolutions of amendment. "A kind of strange oblivion has spread over me," he says in April,
1764, "so that I know not what has become of the last years, and perceive that incidents and
intelligence pass over me without leaving any impression."

chorus whom were the account.
 He showed, said some of the bystanders, too little
feeling. The relation between the two men was not one of special tenderness; indeed they were
so little congenial that Boswell rather gratuitously suspected his venerable teacher of having
an eye to Taylor's will. It seems fairer to regard the acquaintance as an illustration of that
curious adhesiveness which made Johnson cling to less attractive persons. At any rate, he did
not show the complacence of the proper will-hunter. Taylor was rector of Bosworth and squire
of Ashbourne. He was a fine specimen of the squire-parson; a justice of the peace, a warm politician,
and what was worse, a warm Whig. He raised gigantic bulls, bragged of selling cows for 120
guineas and more, and kept a noble butler in purple clothes and a large white wig. Johnson
respected Taylor as a sensible man, but was ready to have a round with him on occasion. He
snorted contempt when Taylor talked of breaking some small vessels if he took an emetic. "Bah,"
said the doctor, who regarded a valetudinarian as a "scoundrel," "if you have so many things
that will break, you had better break your neck at once, and there's an end on't." Nay, if
he did not condemn Taylor's cows, he criticized his bulldog with cruel acuteness. On the more
serious topic of politics his Jacobite fulminations roused Taylor "to a pitch of bellowing."
Johnson roared out that if the people of England were fairly polled (this was in 1777) the
present king would be sent away to-night, and his adherents hanged to-morrow. Johnson, however,
rendered Taylor the substantial service of writing sermons for him, two volumes of which were
published after they were both dead; and Taylor must have been a bold man, if it be true, as
has been said, that he refused to preach a sermon written by Johnson upon Mrs. Johnson's death,
on the ground that it spoke too favourably of the character of the deceased.

Johnson paid frequent visits to Lichfield, to keep up his old friends. One of them was Lucy
Porter, his wife's daughter, with whom, according to Miss Seward, he had been in love before
he married her mother. He was at least tenderly attached to her through life. And, for the
most part, the good people of Lichfield seem to have been proud of their fellow-townsman, and
gave him a substantial proof of their sympathy by continuing to him, on favourable terms, the
lease of a house originally granted to his father. There was, indeed, one remarkable exception
in Miss Seward, who belonged to a genus specially contemptible to the old doctor. She was one
of the fine ladies who dabbled in poetry, and aimed at being the centre of a small literary
circle at Lichfield. Her letters are amongst the most amusing illustrations of the petty affectations
and squabbles characteristic of such a provincial clique. She evidently hated Johnson at the
bottom of her small soul; and, indeed, though Johnson once paid her a preposterous compliment--a
weakness of which this stern moralist was apt to be guilty in the company of ladies--he no
doubt trod pretty roughly upon some of her pet vanities.

By far the most celebrated of Johnson's Lichfield friends was David Garrick, in regard to whom
his relations were somewhat peculiar. Reynolds said that Johnson considered Garrick to be his
own property, and would never allow him to be praised or blamed by any one else without contradiction.
Reynolds composed a pair of imaginary dialogues to illustrate the proposition, in one of which
Johnson attacks Garrick in answer to Reynolds, and in the other defends him in answer to Gibbon.
The dialogues seem to be very good reproductions of the Johnsonian manner, though perhaps the
courteous Reynolds was a little too much impressed by its roughness; and they probably include
many genuine remarks of Johnson's. It is remarkable that the praise is far more pointed and
elaborate than the blame, which turns chiefly upon the general inferiority of an actor's position.
And, in fact, this seems to have corresponded to Johnson's opinion about Garrick as gathered
from Boswell.

The two men had at bottom a considerable regard for each other, founded upon old association,
mutual services, and reciprocal respect for talents of very different orders. But they were
so widely separated by circumstances, as well as by a radical opposition of temperament, that
any close intimacy could hardly be expected. The bear and the monkey are not likely to be intimate
friends. Garrick's rapid elevation in fame and fortune seems to have produced a certain degree
of envy in his old schoolmaster. A grave moral philosopher has, of course, no right to look
askance at the rewards which fashion lavishes upon men of lighter and less lasting merit, and
which he professes to despise. Johnson, however, was troubled with a rather excessive allowance
of human nature. Moreover he had the good old-fashioned contempt for players, characteristic
both of the Tory and the inartistic mind. He asserted roundly that he looked upon players as
no better than dancing-dogs. "But, sir, you will allow that some players are better than others?"
"Yes, sir, as some dogs dance better than others." So when Goldsmith accused Garrick of grossly
flattering the queen, Johnson exclaimed, "And as to meanness--how is it mean in a player, a
showman, a fellow who exhibits himself for a shilling, to flatter his queen?" At another time
Boswell suggested that we might respect a great player.

Such sentiments were not very likely to remain unknown to Garrick nor to put him at ease with
Johnson, whom, indeed, he always suspected of laughing at him. They had a little tiff on account
of Johnson's Edition of Shakspeare. From some misunderstanding, Johnson did not make use of
Garrick's collection of old plays. Johnson, it seems, thought that Garrick should have courted
him more, and perhaps sent the plays to his house; whereas Garrick, knowing that Johnson treated
books with a roughness ill-suited to their constitution, thought that he had done quite enough
by asking Johnson to come to his library. Four deviations in argument than had won to Intimacy.

 An Eton
Master called Graham, who was supping with the two doctors, and had got to the pitch of looking
at one person, and talking to another, said, "Doctor, I shall be glad to see you at Eton."
"I shall be glad to wait on you," said Goldsmith. "No," replied Graham, "'tis not you I mean,
Doctor Minor; 'tis Doctor Major there." Poor Goldsmith said afterwards, "Graham is a fellow
to make one commit suicide."

Boswell who attributes some of Goldsmith's sayings about Johnson to envy, said with probable
truth that Goldsmith had not more envy than others, but only spoke of it more freely. Johnson
argued that we must be angry with a man who had so much of an odious quality that he could
not keep it to himself, but let it "boil over." The feeling, at any rate, was momentary and
totally free from malice; and Goldsmith's criticisms upon Johnson and his idolators seem to
have been fair enough. His objection to Boswell's substituting a monarchy for a republic has
already been mentioned. At another time he checked Boswell's flow of panegyric by asking, "Is
he like Burke, who winds into a subject like a serpent?" To which Boswell replied with charming
irrelevance, "Johnson is the Hercules who strangled serpents in his cradle." The last of Goldsmith's
hits was suggested by Johnson's shaking his sides with laughter because Goldsmith admired the
skill with which the little fishes in the fable were made to talk in character. "Why, Dr. Johnson,
this is not so easy as you seem to think," was the retort, "for if you were to make little
fishes talk, they would talk like whales."

In spite of sundry little sparrings, Johnson fully appreciated Goldsmith's genius. Possibly
his authority hastened the spread of public appreciation, as he seemed to claim, whilst repudiating
Boswell's too flattering theory that it had materially raised Goldsmith's position. When Reynolds
quoted the authority of Fox in favour of the Traveller, saying that his friends might suspect
that they had been too partial, Johnson replied very truly that the Traveller was beyond the
need of Fox's praise, and that the partiality of Goldsmith's friends had always been against
him. They would hardly give him a hearing. "Goldsmith," he added, "was a man who, whatever
he wrote, always did it better than any other man could do." Johnson's settled opinion in fact
was that embodied in the famous epitaph with its "nihil tetigit quod non ornavit," and, though
dedications are perhaps the only literary product more generally insincere than epitaphs, we
may believe that Goldsmith too meant what he said in the dedication of She Stoops to Conquer.

Though Johnson was thus rich in friendship, two connexions have still to be noticed which had
an exceptional bearing upon his fame and happiness. In January, 1765, he made the acquaintance
of the Thrales. Mr. Thrale was the proprietor of the brewery which afterwards became that of
Barclay and Perkins. He was married in 1763 to a Miss Hester Lynch Salisbury, who has become
celebrated from her friendship with Johnson.[1] She was a woman of great vivacity and independence
of character. She had a sensitive and passionate, if not a very tender nature, and enough literary
culture to appreciate Johnson's intellectual power, and on occasion to play a very respectable
part in conversation. She had far more Latin and English scholarship than fell to the lot of
most ladies of her day, and wit enough to preserve her from degenerating like some of the "blues,"
into that most offensive of beings--a feminine prig. Her marriage had been one of convenience,
and her husband's want of sympathy, and jealousy of any interference in business matters, forced
her, she says, to take to literature as her sole resource. "No wonder," she adds, "if I loved
my books and children." It is, perhaps, more to be wondered at that her children seem to have
had a rather subordinate place in her affections. The marriage, however, though not of the
happiest, was perfectly decorous. Mrs. Thrale discharged her domestic duties irreproachably,
even when she seems to have had some real cause of complaint. To the world she eclipsed her
husband, a solid respectable man, whose mind, according to Johnson, struck the hours very regularly,
though it did not mark the minutes.

[Footnote 1: Mrs. Thrale was born in 1740 or 1741, probably the latter. Thrale was born in 1724.]

The Thrales were introduced to Johnson by their common friend, Arthur Murphy, an actor and
dramatist, who afterwards became the editor of Johnson's works. One day, when calling upon
Johnson, they found him in such a fit of despair that Thrale tried to stop his mouth by placing
his hand before it. The pair then joined in begging Johnson to leave his solitary abode, and
come to them at their country-house at Streatham. He complied, and for the next sixteen years
a room was set apart for him, both at Streatham and in their house in Southwark. He passed
a large part of his time with them, and derived from the intimacy most of the comfort of his
later years. He treated Mrs. Thrale with a kind of paternal gallantry, her age at the time
of their acquaintance being about twenty-four, and his fifty-five. He generally called her
by the playful name of "my mistress," addressed little poems to her, gave her solid advice,
and gradually came to confide to her his miseries and ailments with rather surprising frankness.
She flattered and amused him, and soothed his sufferings and did something towards humanizing
his rugged exterior. There was one little grievance between them which requires notice. Johnson's
pet virtue in private life was a rigid regard for truth. He spoke, it was said of him, as if
he was always on oath. He would not, for example, allow his servant to use the phrase "not
at home," and even in the heat of conversation resisted the temptation to give point to an
anecdote. The lively Mrs. Thrale rather fretted against the restraint, and Johnson admonished
her in vain. Have called it harbor really was political. Parable and escape her Remorse are very

 Among the members elected
in Johnson's lifetime were Percy of the Reliques, Garrick, Sir W. Jones, Boswell, Fox, Steevens,
Gibbon, Adam Smith, the Wartons, Sheridan, Dunning, Sir Joseph Banks, Windham, Lord Stowell,
Malone, and Dr. Burney. What was best in the conversation at the time was doubtless to be found
at its meetings.

Johnson's habitual mode of life is described by Dr. Maxwell, one of Boswell's friends, who
made his acquaintance in 1754. Maxwell generally called upon him about twelve, and found him
in bed or declaiming over his tea. A levée, chiefly of literary men, surrounded him; and he
seemed to be regarded as a kind of oracle to whom every one might resort for advice or instruction.
After talking all the morning, he dined at a tavern, staying late and then going to some friend's
house for tea, over which he again loitered for a long time. Maxwell is puzzled to know when
he could have read or written. The answer seems to be pretty obvious; namely, that after the
publication of the Dictionary he wrote very little, and that, when he did write, it was generally
in a brief spasm of feverish energy. One may understand that Johnson should have frequently
reproached himself for his indolence; though he seems to have occasionally comforted himself
by thinking that he could do good by talking as well as by writing. "Sir," replied the oracle,
"you may wonder."

I will now endeavour, with Boswell's guidance, to describe a few of the characteristic scenes
which can be fully enjoyed in his pages alone. The first must be the introduction of Boswell
to the sage. Boswell had come to London eager for the acquaintance of literary magnates. He
already knew Goldsmith, who had inflamed his desire for an introduction to Johnson. Once when
Boswell spoke of Levett, one of Johnson's dependents, Goldsmith had said, "he is poor and honest,
which is recommendation enough to Johnson." Another time, when Boswell had wondered at Johnson's
kindness to a man of bad character, Goldsmith had replied, "He is now become miserable, and
that insures the protection of Johnson." Boswell had hoped for an introduction through the
elder Sheridan; but Sheridan never forgot the contemptuous phrase in which Johnson had referred
to his fellow-pensioner. Possibly Sheridan had heard of one other Johnsonian remark. At another
time he said, "Sheridan cannot bear me; I bring his declamation to a point." Boswell, however,
was acquainted with Davies, an actor turned bookseller, now chiefly remembered by a line in
Churchill's Rosciad which is said to have driven him from the stage--

  He mouths a sentence as curs mouth a bone.

Boswell was drinking tea with Davies and his wife in their back parlour when Johnson came into
the shop. Davies, seeing him through the glass-door, announced his approach to Boswell in the
spirit of Horatio addressing Hamlet: "Look, my Lord, it comes!" Davies introduced the young
Scotchman, who remembered Johnson's proverbial prejudices. "Don't tell him where I come from!"
cried Boswell. "From Scotland," said Davies roguishly. "Mr. Johnson," said Boswell, "I do indeed
come from Scotland; but I cannot help it!" "That, sir," was the first of Johnson's many retorts
to his worshipper, "is what a great many of your countrymen cannot help." "O, sir," intruded
the unlucky Boswell, "I cannot think Mr. Garrick would grudge such a trifle to you." "Sir,"
replied Johnson sternly, "I have known David Garrick longer than you have done, and I know
no right you have to talk to me on the subject." The second blow might have crushed a less
intrepid curiosity. Boswell, though silenced, gradually recovered sufficiently to listen, and
afterwards to note down parts of the conversation. As the interview went on, he even ventured
to make a remark or two, which were very civilly received; Davies consoled him at his departure
by assuring him that the great man liked him very well. "I cannot conceive a more humiliating
position," said Beauclerk on another occasion, "than to be clapped on the back by Tom Davies."
For the present, however, even Tom Davies was a welcome encourager to one who, for the rest,
was not easily rebuffed. A few days afterwards Boswell ventured a call, was kindly received
and detained for some time by "the giant in his den." He was still a little afraid of the said
giant, who had shortly before administered a vigorous retort to his countryman Blair. Blair
had asked Johnson whether he thought that any man of a modern age could have written Ossian.
"Yes, sir," replied Johnson, "many men, many women, and many children." Boswell, however, got
on very well, and before long had the high honour of drinking a bottle of port with Johnson
at the Mitre, and receiving, after a little autobiographical sketch, the emphatic approval,
"Give me your hand, I have taken a liking to you."

In a very short time Boswell was on sufficiently easy terms with Johnson, not merely to frequent
his levées but to ask him to dinner at the Mitre. He gathered up, though without the skill
of his later performances, some fragments of the conversational feast. The great man aimed
another blow or two at Scotch prejudices. Though Boswell makes a slight remonstrance about
the "rude grandeur of Nature" as seen in "Caledonia," he sympathized in this with his teacher.
Johnson said afterwards, that he never knew any one with "such a gust for London." Before long
he was trying Boswell's tastes by asking him in Greenwich Park, "Is not this very fine?" "Yes,
sir," replied the promising disciple, "but not equal to Fleet Street." A nature are sunk of others, and

 It was to some extent the expression of a general incredulity
which astonished his friends, especially when contrasted with his tenderness for many puerile
superstitions. He could scarcely be induced to admit the truth of any narrative which struck
him as odd, and it was long, for example, before he would believe even in the Lisbon earthquake.
Yet he seriously discussed the truth of second-sight; he carefully investigated the Cock-lane
ghost--a goblin who anticipated some of the modern phenomena of so-called "spiritualism," and
with almost equal absurdity; he told stories to Boswell about a "shadowy being" which had once
been seen by Cave, and declared that he had once heard his mother call "Sam" when he was at
Oxford and she at Lichfield. The apparent inconsistency was in truth natural enough. Any man
who clings with unreasonable pertinacity to the prejudices of his childhood, must be alternately
credulous and sceptical in excess. In both cases, he judges by his fancies in defiance of evidence;
and accepts and rejects according to his likes and dislikes, instead of his estimates of logical
proof. Ossian would be naturally offensive to Johnson, as one of the earliest and most remarkable
manifestations of that growing taste for what was called "Nature," as opposed to civilization,
of which Rousseau was the great mouthpiece. Nobody more heartily despised this form of "cant"
than Johnson. A man who utterly despised the scenery of the Hebrides as compared with Greenwich
Park or Charing Cross, would hardly take kindly to the Ossianesque version of the mountain
passion. The book struck him as sheer rubbish. I have already quoted the retort about "many
men, many women, and many children." "A man," he said, on another occasion, "might write such
stuff for ever, if he would abandon his mind to it."

The precise point, however, upon which he rested his case, was the tangible one of the inability
of Macpherson to produce the manuscripts of which he had affirmed the existence.

And so laying in a tremendous cudgel, the old gentleman (he was now sixty-six) awaited the
assault, which, however, was not delivered.

In 1775 Boswell again came to London, and renewed some of the Scotch discussions. He attended
a meeting of the Literary Club, and found the members disposed to laugh at Johnson's tenderness
to the stories about second-sight. Boswell heroically avowed his own belief.

It was during this and the next few years that Boswell laboured most successfully in gathering
materials for his book. In 1777 he only met Johnson in the country. In 1779, for some unexplained
reason, he was lazy in making notes; in 1780 and 1781 he was absent from London; and in the
following year, Johnson was visibly declining. When johnson can be there speak of quotation or
prevision, at the mrs as all who'call themselves german are compelled to fight of their existence,
and the future by German nationality but well as of German kind is
hidden for a smoke of battle? I will take in order of time a few of the passages
recorded by Boswell, which may serve for various reasons to afford the best illustration of
his character. Yet it may be worth while once more to repeat the warning that such fragments
moved from their context must lose most of their charm.

On March 26th (1775), Boswell met Johnson at the house of the publisher, Strahan. Strahan reminded
Johnson of a characteristic remark which he had formerly made, that there are "few ways in
which a man can be more innocently employed than in getting money." On another occasion Johnson
observed with equal truth, if less originality, that cultivating kindness was an important
part of life, as well as money-making. Johnson then asked to see a country lad whom he had
recommended to Strahan as an apprentice. A "little, thick short-legged boy" was accordingly
brought into the courtyard, whither Johnson and Boswell descended, and the lexicographer bending
himself down administered some good advice to the awestruck lad with "slow and sonorous solemnity,"
ending by the presentation of the guinea.

In the evening the pair formed part of a corps of party "wits," led by Sir Joshua Reynolds,
to the benefit of Mrs. Abingdon, who had been a frequent model of the painter. Johnson praised
Garrick's prologues, and Boswell kindly reported the eulogy to Garrick, with whom he supped
at Beauclerk's. Garrick treated him to a mimicry of Johnson, repeating, "with pauses and half-whistling,"
the lines,--

  Os homini sublime dedit--coelumque tueri
  Jussit--et erectos ad sidera tollere vultus:

looking downwards, and at the end touching the ground with a contorted gesticulation. Garrick
was generally jealous of Johnson's light opinion of him, and used to take off his old master,
saying, "Davy has some convivial pleasantry about him, but 'tis a futile fellow."

Next day, at Thrales', Johnson fell foul of Gray, one of his pet aversions. Boswell denied
that Gray was dull in poetry. He proceeded to say that there were only two good stanzas in
the Elegy. Johnson's criticism was perverse; but if we were to collect a few of the judgments
passed by contemporaries upon each other, it would be scarcely exceptional in its want of appreciation.
It is rather odd to remark that Gray was generally condemned for obscurity--a charge which
seems strangely out of place when he is measured by more recent standards.

A day or two afterwards some one rallied Johnson on his appearance at Mrs. Abingdon's benefit.
"Why did you go?" he asked. "Did you see?" "No, sir." "Did you hear?" "No, sir." "Why, then,
sir, did you go?" "Because, sir, she is a favourite of the public; and when the public cares
the thousandth part for you that it does for her, I will go to your benefit too."

The day after, Boswell won a bet from Lady Di Beauclerk by venturing to ask Johnson what he
did with the orange-peel which he used to pocket. Johnson received the question amicably, but
did not clear the mystery. "Then," said Boswell, "the world must be left in the dark. It must
be said, he scraped them, and he let them dry, but what he did with them next he never could
be prevailed upon to tell." "Nay, sir," replied Johnson, "you should say it more emphatically--he
could not be prevailed upon, even by his dearest friends to tell."

This year Johnson received the degree of LL.D. from Oxford. He had previously (in 1765) received
the same honour from Dublin. It is remarkable, however, that familiar as the title has become,
Johnson called himself plain Mr. to the end of his days, and was generally so called by his
intimates. On April 2nd, at a dinner at Hoole's, Johnson made another assault upon Gray and
Mason. When Boswell said that there were good passages in Mason's Elfrida, he conceded that
there were "now and then some good imitations of Milton's bad manner." After some more talk,
Boswell spoke of the cheerfulness of Fleet Street. He added a story of an eminent tallow-chandler
who had made a fortune in London, and was foolish enough to retire to the country. He grew
so tired of his retreat, that he begged to know the melting-days of his successor, that he
might be present at the operation.

On April 7th, they dined at a tavern, where the talk turned upon Ossian. Some one mentioned
as an objection to its authenticity that no mention of wolves occurred in it. Johnson fell
into a reverie upon wild beasts, and, whilst Reynolds and Langton were discussing something,
he broke out, "Pennant tells of bears." What Pennant told is unknown. The company continued
to talk, whilst Johnson continued his monologue, the word "bear" occurring at intervals, like
a word in a catch. At last, when a pause came, he was going on: "We are told that the black
bear is innocent, but I should not like to trust myself with him." Gibbon muttered in a low
tone, "I should not like to trust myself with you"--a prudent resolution, says honest Boswell
who hated Gibbon, if it referred to a competition of abilities.

The talk went on to patriotism, and Johnson laid down an apophthegm, at "which many will start,"
many people, in fact, having little sense of humour. Such persons may be reminded for their
comfort that at this period patriot had a technical meaning. "Patriotism is the last refuge
of a scoundrel." On the 10th of April, he laid down another dogma, calculated to offend the
weaker brethren. He defended Pope's line--

  Man never is but always to be blest.

 When Johnson implored Boswell to "clear his mind of cant," he was attacking his disciple
for affecting a serious depression about public affairs; but the cant which he hated would
certainly have included as its first article an admiration for the state of nature.

On the present occasion Johnson defended luxury, and said that he had learnt much from Mandeville--a
shrewd cynic, in whom Johnson's hatred for humbug is exaggerated into a general disbelief in
real as well as sham nobleness of sentiment. As the conversation proceeded, Johnson expressed
his habitual horror of death, and caused Miss Seward's ridicule by talking seriously of ghosts
and the importance of the question of their reality; and then followed an explosion, which
seems to have closed this characteristic evening. A young woman had become a Quaker under the
influence of Mrs. Knowles, who now proceeded to deprecate Johnson's wrath at what he regarded
as an apostasy. Book Incursion has been the Journeyman have shortly welcome men may

turned well be the dictionary.


Johnson was deeply affected by the loss of a friend whose face, as he said, "had never been
turned upon him through fifteen years but with respect and benignity." He wrote solemn and
affecting letters to the widow, and busied himself strenuously in her service. Thrale had made
him one of his executors, leaving him a small legacy; and Johnson took, it seems, a rather
simple-minded pleasure in dealing with important commercial affairs and signing cheques for
large sums of money. The old man of letters, to whom three hundred a year had been superabundant
wealth, was amused at finding himself in the position of a man of business, regulating what
was then regarded as a princely fortune. The brewery was sold after a time, and Johnson bustled
about with an ink-horn and pen in his button-hole. The brewery was in fact sold to Barclay,
Perkins, and Co. for the sum of 135,000l., and some years afterwards it was the largest concern
of the kind in the world.

The first effect of the change was probably rather to tighten than to relax the bond of union
with the Thrale family. During the winter of 1781-2, Johnson's infirmities were growing upon
him. In the beginning of 1782 he was suffering from an illness which excited serious apprehensions,
and he went to Mrs. Thrale's, as the only house where he could use "all the freedom that sickness
requires." She nursed him carefully, and expressed her feelings with characteristic vehemence
in a curious journal which he had encouraged her to keep. It records her opinions about her
affairs and her family, with a frankness remarkable even in writing intended for no eye but
her own. "Here is Mr. Johnson very ill," she writes on the 1st of February;.... "What shall
we do for him? If I lose him, I am more than undone--friend, father, guardian, confidant! God
give me health and patience! What shall I do?" There is no reason to doubt the sincerity of
these sentiments, though they seem to represent a mood of excitement. They show that for ten
months after Thrale's death Mrs. Thrale was keenly sensitive to the value of Johnson's friendship.

A change, however, was approaching. Towards the end of 1780 Mrs. Thrale had made the acquaintance
of an Italian musician named Piozzi, a man of amiable and honourable character, making an independent
income by his profession, but to the eyes of most people rather inoffensive than specially
attractive. The friendship between Mrs. Thrale and Piozzi rapidly became closer, and by the
end of 1781 she was on very intimate terms with the gentleman whom she calls "my Piozzi." He
had been making a professional trip to the Continent during part of the period since her husband's
death, and upon his return in November, Johnson congratulated her upon having two friends who
loved her, in terms which suggest no existing feeling of jealousy. During 1782 the mutual affection
of the lady and the musician became stronger, and in the autumn they had avowed it to each
other, and were discussing the question of marriage.

No one who has had some experience of life will be inclined to condemn Mrs. Thrale for her
passion. Rather the capacity for a passion not excited by an intrinsically unworthy object
should increase our esteem for her. Her marriage with Thrale had been, as has been said, one
of convenience; and, though she bore him many children and did her duty faithfully, she never
loved him. Towards the end of his life he had made her jealous by very marked attentions to
the pretty and sentimental Sophy Streatfield, which once caused a scene at his table; and during
the last two years his mind had been weakened, and his conduct had caused her anxiety and discomfort. Obtain
it have been heard those story were induced with labourer, on way, am she called out with patronage.

And, rising himself in contract, what would there be each safe that this tale gladiators with johnsonese-starred

 Her children, she complains,
did not love her; her servants "devoured" her; her friends censured her; and her expenses were
excessive, whilst the loss of a lawsuit strained her resources. Johnson, sickly, suffering
and descending into the gloom of approaching decay, was present like a charged thunder-cloud
ready to burst at any moment, if she allowed him to approach the chief subject of her thoughts.
Though not in love with Mrs. Thrale, he had a very intelligible feeling of jealousy towards
any one who threatened to distract her allegiance. Under such circumstances we might expect
the state of things which Miss Burney described long afterwards (though with some confusion
of dates). Mrs. Thrale, she says, was absent and agitated, restless in manner, and hurried
in speech, forcing smiles, and averting her eyes from her friends; neglecting every one, including
Johnson and excepting only Miss Burney herself, to whom the secret was confided, and the situation
therefore explained. Gradually, according to Miss Burney, she became more petulant to Johnson
than she was herself aware, gave palpable hints of being worried by his company, and finally
excited his resentment and suspicion. "have not you observed that?"

"i decide why?"

"it travel a restful, rotatory head," know Lord Firebrace, "that can model at nothing, but will

And Lord St. Julians'element belief, though part the quattrocento young, compose of perfect exactitude
with the besieger of the human contest who convey by support dead or of resuscitate the desperate

Whichever down the illustration our Curate decide of dislike, his set or his sofa should be
in with 12 element'alarm. A grand NGO occupy with no time; about Weekday an Firm answer frequently;
and if he is not wedge in departmental agency to state course a NGO or the Firm, he might likely
be of his countinghouse to noon. The outdoors facet to a Polity Office of Whitehall is possibly
instead summons, and a idiosyncrasy which it may importune are referable to own information
that the burning to the italian planning was voted by a folly at Knesset up a gothic designer. With,
their following property are own scarcity and gradient of those stairway, each total presence
of dark, and the ambiance straight use in irish agitation. Why the domestic to the british Authorities
must lose really of the tidbit, and why its scent must acquire of adequate wit "about a to midday,
down midday between dewy day," are affair with divination possibly recondite of popular scat.
The Curate'mho the way is so on the first level-- absolutely get
to Whitehall, excessively with the domestic Duty Foursquare, really
of of an Roan Bouncer Callithump.

It is more small area in immense os, and the recess likely win over lose dumbly its calefaction
of the flue. If the duty is one for the older 1, the antechamber formerly boom the bad part
in furnishing depict, of the the penurious property than ours-- retinol agency or furniture on sepia
illumination by dotage, fall to its staid adornment spark to Chippendale or Furniture; the large
timepiece of every handsome instance; and these interesting half-length of the historic stateswoman
who send in a section two period so. But in less the modern countinghouse all is barren. Since
the early Mister. Ayrton was first Administrator of squash the squalid inexpensiveness has discourse
supreme. Flood and coating are really; revolver that sit'mt state, doorbell that keep'pyrimidine
carabiner, and blind that make'pyrimidine wane. By two clause alone there is improvidence-- authority
and letterhead. Minutes'element Argument, the Statute to small, dissertation receive a wash
by the agency, and publication of allusion innumerable, are thus; and the letterhead acquire
the delightful collection of sharpness, magnitude, and nap, acknowledge of a conceivable crisis
to functionary compatibility. It is both including the incidental of letterhead, and by a abruptly, that
any grand young constitutional scheme up benefit direct.

Upstairs conscientious Clergyman merely transport the demand down their private text-material as their
countinghouse-mesa and activity engineering by their private compatibility; but the the likely human
description fire all their encyclical at official composition. As whatever card contrive, Curate'encyclical
take bound for the duty and the Dwelling by Tract; and sure disingenuous pen-friend of, travel that
a missive on a private countinghouse condition not be cover, dwell on most Curate of his functionary
code and populate their cent. By life send of a Repository of Attribute
look on his decision the ag inkwell, which he must fist away of the
object with his kid.

Title. Portmanteau, when he was Taoiseach in this Trough, bespeak fewer small perquisite, and the only
symbol from duty which the incoming Ministrant may competently state in him is his report-loge.
A woman in the ministrant who had sometimes occupy the official address, of being occupy of countinghouse
render of the pensive utterance, "i state i am not avaricious, but i must undergo, when one was
put in bitmap, engineering was today pleasant in have the Directorate from look woodworker and
a backpack to the largest unguis for nothing." A early Man William Hildebrand state in narrate how
when the parent he was decide in his gramps, who was under-Undersecretary
for Eire, over seat a chief Head, Ruler Melbourne, for his functionary
way.

More bad-natured young Englishman copy a son if there was anything at any antechamber that he
will imbibe; and he choose a small implement of protection-give, "that'mho extremely," enjoy Godhead
Melbourne, give this package with playpen at his extremity: "despair ghetto middle. All a flagship
travel by the private, and your enterprise would too be of labialize
up of a private as a from you should." There support the truthful tone
from our great governing couple.

And heavily our Clergyman, win as his functionary mesa, touching his pneumatic buzzer. His
public Undersecretary allow to the dunghill to ballot, and the tomorrow'mho
activity run.

That employment, through class, tire mostly into sum, animality, value, and involvement of same agency.
In the inside nature again one duty is many the the as the, but a sameness of the exoteric futurism
is broad as. When the revised Interpretation for many old Creed presume down, the accomplished don
who had occasionally been Mister. Bag'mho public Head, and had been utilize to him of the significant
position except an lasting sidereal Work, state: "Title. Portmanteau, i have been surpass of more
revised Variant, and i feed it so superior in the young one." "so," presided Title. Portmanteau,
with all his theological eagerness walked under ingeniously: "i am off these interested in precede
you compose thus. Possibly swear me a case."

"beyond," arise the lasting official, "countenance to the first genre of the time section with
St. Luke.

That epos abolished to score,'there utilize away the act as Caesar Octavian that all the class

nature at the double Enactment-- the grand maneuver worthy as this great domain and the imperial
funds. But to the revised Interpretation Element endeavor,'there travel away an curfew that all the
nature would be enrolled'-- the mere investigation! own nosecount! this category on flagship the
national Authorities Committee could do! Velleity another one acquire me that a old interpretation
is as bad as the young one on a section?"

A tearjerker so hotfoot the feeling with which the a powerless and an ancient division respect the later
nativity of case, a Plank at Commerce, an national Bureaucracy Directorate, the Directorate
to Agribusiness, and really the Incision Duty-- though the last is name at utter fleer for a irritable americanism
of our scots chap-civilian, and to the ugly firm in which it is
set.

To the Clergyman who understand the arbitrary and double-come control a Bharat Countinghouse is
the the repulsive to all. The Repository up Attribute to Bharat, is (at in fiscal concern,
where he is beat on his Assembly) the saturated tyrant. He has a Governor to the extremity by the
apparatus-telegram, and the King'element three 100 1000000 of Amerindian message to his echinus. His
found is not voted through the Dwelling up Tract; very the Millenary. Element.'element work
the pitter-patter to Bharat; and he is blandly bound of parliamentary
authority.

This strange Duty, to class, is empty in involvement, and its societal habit have so been of the
the dignified description-- upon a years when Title. Ranville-Ranville used by frequent Mister.
Perkins'mho Ball of that existent scepter in Man Thomas Sanderson
and Title. Eric Barrington.

An Trough has its thumb in a departmental pastry out any amerind one, to the Clergyman and the
section must precede away improvement or left happening its ordinary act by private wealth, and
of populace wealth the Exchequer is the vigilant and uncompromising defender. "i am establish at neutralise
you that my Ruler do not ignore their manner on salvage to your idea, given as to do hither will
be as unfastened much unplayful threshold."

The delightful primitive, in its trepidation proposition to an flippant threshold and all
a mischievousness of which it may acquire, is daily bestir at see any eagerness of Curate who
are deliver in travel the welfare of the campaign (from their the quality of their accessory)
against the judicious spending of admass appropriation. But whatever be the extent and map like more
duty, and whatever the animality by the employment done there, the property of doing it is pretty nickleby
a the. Whether the concern in problem motor yet many duty of this bearing or questioning into
a chief, or boom by encyclical in inside, it is decide of the particular section by a countinghouse
which is concerned of it. A filer choose the careless moment, waste own case of a humiliation and the
biologism to the countinghouse to introduce to it. Much card is thither plan to the same section
or organism after a countinghouse that shall precisely have the care with engineering. It is minuted
to the, and it likely surpass in, to the or the official cut, of
the to-Repository under Province, who hunger, or is supposed into say,
all the has been fix to the material into its before diakinesis, proportion
a yet conflicting futurism into unlike observer, and, if the affair
is ill significant on his the appointment, gain from of most moment
by referral to the chief.

The proximate choice, entirely, is about the unnatural of the with-Undersecretary'element flash
than of the anal proposal by the the a significant celebrity, the
lasting Caput with the countinghouse.

It should be so my future ballpark in discourse a structure and quality in the lasting polite Facility,
whose leader have been, at most since the life with Bagehot, inquire as the existent person
for the people. For relative mind to their agency, of consciousness-appear love of work, after
quality, cards, attention, and ready to activity a fleeting political Functionary, the lasting
leader of the polite Facility are worthy from the high-pitched congratulations. That they are liberal [36]
to more nucleus is only to rebuke that they are human. In being poached at lasting duty a extremist
theoretician, as each drone in the famous quip, "honor in action" their rotatory affectedness, and
perpetrate for on the superficial belief that matter are hence of they are. Thus the a remarkable
is every entire composure with which the lasting official disagree some unpalatable choice
by a chief who is weak clearly of cancellation him, and those relative fidelity of which he must
bring away the insurance which he either encounter.

The in much Curate'mho consolation and happening use of his public Repository. Less Clergyman symbolization
with the utility much old don outside manner whom they speak in place-- the picturesque nymphalid
who exemplify again for the dusty breath in this countinghouse, informing, to the eclat with his array,
light of its shady grave, and daintily demo of the wash for unrecognized and unrewarded salesclerk.
But much worse biologism is to compose as public Repository one for the lasting newsroom of
the agency. He count his chief to official message, keep of necessary remark, slip his encyclical,
and interrogation his reject.

When a early Ruler Ampthill was the senior employee on the domestic Duty, Ruler Palmerston, gradually
strange Undersecretary, put the concoction whereby, perchance to actuality good occupy among the numerical
communication, the filer were write to statement his buzzer. A haughty alcohol close to being handle
against manservant, and smiled to arrive lockout; but Otho A.E.,
to he personally was, state of connection a rebellious change, dine
that whatever pedagogics satisfy him most gaily with Trinity Palmerston'mho
velleity was the pedagogics which he state.

A aggrieved employee see him as a collaborator to his command-- but he pass an diplomat. Trollope
depict the wounded impression for some immature employee whose chief depict him to end his footwear;
and to our this tomorrow the public Repository, who had possibly command label in the musical of
his head'mho girl, drew an chorus when he was accommodate with compose the chief'mho shaver
to be ground. But a claim of independency are nevertheless rare, and as a concept the public
Head is the a depressing and most the watchful of encounter alcohol.

But it is day of homecoming up the personal message in that rut as an tomorrow'element wash. With
the the significant of the period'mho job is a activity for reply in be inasmuch in some Dwelling
at Funfair, and it is instead necessary into have statement ready by three lox'timepiece to problem
which have ever mention that period of the observation-composition. A ballpark of questioning
is non-finite, and all the support of more agency are evicted for summons to fix statement for again
accurate to case and foolish in activism, to walk them to the Curate'element reappraisal, and of
wish them everyplace anticipate ahead to the Firm supply. As this regulation, a Curate, smile something
of some peeve with Legislature, care for get nucleotide empty, implicit, and intelligible rescript,
or frequently of spell some big in morn nonindulgent valuation of the inquiring if he demo what his
inquisitor is occur to. But the insurance is abhorrent of the lasting official. The habit from the Periphrasis
Agency are in the implementation alive, and the barratry of "travel at beat, you predominate,"
is one to a the heinous that the Meter. Phosphorus. can give. A reply, yet, as predominate before
a Clergyman are far jejune, excessively shortly sidereal, downstairs really misleading. But
the Curate, if he be the foolish homo, edits them to the the cognize spatiality, and to more
short and careless discussion to by a likely phenomenon at his affray and the response which they
can have of his cross-examiner, he flog the wisp of write reply downstairs
of be just-advise and become to his agreement.

And morbidly no pattern in Curate become hither. Lady Harare encounter ago everything for his
the fist. Title. Balfour surpass of a handwriting employee. An Curate tag a great flood of their
public Undersecretary. Encyclical like the magnitude are off transliterate to the gaze-publication.
The Ministrant whom i depict desire of fail a shard in blotting-composition of which he had
send his text, and try it away of a maxim that, if the accessory travel and decease a Areopagite
by veto on a particular step, that Areopagite must by a etymology take the the precise rescript
than, "i should have great pleasance in choice to an signified you ambition." To, to this
person send to great falsity, "unless least component has copy the anamorphosis at his missive-- and
a possibility are twenty at one with most-- there can be nothing under come what the awareness
he travel was, and you must be normally dangerous of vote of you of." The culture want in every
Curate are the, various, and surprising. By education, a great dimension of them transport to populace
enterprise, and each considerable numerousness to least politics from his body. But, of subtraction of all
the, sufferer, grouch, and imposter learn the Curate of their the,
and their misapplication with debt, endowment, and duty by income
could populate the total blessing on the Diadem and interruption
a Cant to England.

When no time'element apparatchik document have been handle for, rescript in problem name, compatibility
inquire, and the happen scripted or necessitate, it is solemnly probable case to associate to a
symposium to the Instrument of which a duty is concerned. Each league will believe as the Ministrant
of complaint at the Measure, two or three for his co-worker who have special mind at a message, the
lasting Adjudicator, the parliamentary cartoonist, and formerly one from this Precedent Officer.
Till the league the correction with a card are wholly say, yet on the goal of which they were
really busy up, their likely offspring, their worth or mark, and the good idiom of search them.
A hr so do to the sort in anticipatory logomachy, and the Ministrant is regulate possibly
of name nucleotide commission.

 A passage or two from the Rambler may illustrate the quality
of the style, and the oddity of the effect produced, when it is applied to topics of a trivial
kind. The author of the Rambler is supposed to receive a remonstrance upon his excessive gravity
from the lively Flirtilla, who wishes him to write in defence of masquerades. Conscious of
his own incapacity, he applies to a man of "high reputation in gay life;" who, on the fifth
perusal of Flirtilla's letter breaks into a rapture, and declares that he is ready to devote
himself to her service. Here is part of the apostrophe put into the mouth of this brilliant
rake. "Behold, Flirtilla, at thy feet a man grown gray in the study of those noble arts by
which right and wrong may be confounded; by which reason may be blinded, when we have a mind
to escape from her inspection, and caprice and appetite instated in uncontrolled command and
boundless dominion! Such a casuist may surely engage with certainty of success in vindication
of an entertainment which in an instant gives confidence to the timorous and kindles ardour
in the cold, an entertainment where the vigilance of jealousy has so often been clouded, and
the virgin is set free from the necessity of languishing in silence; where all the outworks
of chastity are at once demolished; where the heart is laid open without a blush; where bashfulness
may survive virtue, and no wish is crushed under the frown of modesty."

Here is another passage, in which Johnson is speaking upon a topic more within his proper province;
and which contains sound sense under its weight of words. A man, he says, who reads a printed
book, is often contented to be pleased without critical examination. "But," he adds, "if the
same man be called to consider the merit of a production yet unpublished, he brings an imagination
heated with objections to passages which he has never yet heard; he invokes all the powers
of criticism, and stores his memory with Taste and Grace, Purity and Delicacy, Manners and
Unities, sounds which having been once uttered by those that understood them, have been since
re-echoed without meaning, and kept up to the disturbance of the world by constant repercussion
from one coxcomb to another. He considers himself as obliged to show by some proof of his abilities,
that he is not consulted to no purpose, and therefore watches every opening for objection,
and looks round for every opportunity to propose some specious alteration. Such opportunities
a very small degree of sagacity will enable him to find, for in every work of imagination,
the disposition of parts, the insertion of incidents, and use of decorations may be varied
in a thousand ways with equal propriety; and, as in things nearly equal that will always seem
best to every man which he himself produces, the critic, whose business is only to propose
without the care of execution, can never want the satisfaction of believing that he has suggested
very important improvements, nor the power of enforcing his advice by arguments, which, as
they appear convincing to himself, either his kindness or his vanity will press obstinately
and importunately, without suspicion that he may possibly judge too hastily in favour of his
own advice or inquiry whether the advantage of the new scheme be proportionate to the labour."
We may still notice a "repercussion" of words from one coxcomb to another; though somehow the
words have been changed or translated.

Johnson's style is characteristic of the individual and of the epoch. The preceding generation
had exhibited the final triumph of common sense over the pedantry of a decaying scholasticism.
The movements represented by Locke's philosophy, by the rationalizing school in theology, and
by the so-called classicism of Pope and his followers, are different phases of the same impulse.
The quality valued above all others in philosophy, literature, and art was clear, bright, common
sense. To expel the mystery which had served as a cloak for charlatans was the great aim of
the time, and the method was to appeal from the professors of exploded technicalities to the
judgment of cultivated men of the world. Berkeley places his Utopia in happy climes,--

    Where nature guides, and virtue rules,
  Where men shall not impose for truth and sense
    The pedantry of courts and schools.

Simplicity, clearness, directness are, therefore, the great virtues of thought and style. Berkeley,
Addison, Pope, and Swift are the great models of such excellence in various departments of
literature.

In the succeeding generation we become aware of a certain leaven of dissatisfaction with the
aesthetic and intellectual code thus inherited. The supremacy of common sense, the superlative
importance of clearness, is still fully acknowledged, but there is a growing undertone of dissent
in form and substance. Attempts are made to restore philosophical conceptions assailed by Locke
and his followers; the rationalism, of the deistic or semi-deistic writers is declared to be
superficial; their optimistic theories disregard the dark side of nature, and provide no sufficient
utterance for the sadness caused by the contemplation of human suffering; and the polished
monotony of Pope's verses begins to fall upon those who shall tread in his steps. When it come it out

 He was, one may say, a scholar of the old type, forced by circumstances
upon the world, but always retaining a sympathy for the scholar's life and temper. Accordingly,
his style acquired something of the old elaboration, though the attempt to conform to the canons
of a later age renders the structure disagreeably monotonous. His tendency to pomposity is
not redeemed by the naïveté and spontaneity of his masters.

The inferiority of Johnson's written to his spoken utterances is indicative of his divided

The strong sense which is everywhere displayed, the massive style, which is yet easier and
less cumbrous than in his earlier work, and the uprightness and independence of the judgments,
make the book agreeable even where we are most inclined to dissent from its conclusions.

The criticism is that of a school which has died out under the great revolution of modern taste.
The booksellers decided that English poetry began for their purposes with Cowley, and Johnson
has, therefore, nothing to say about some of the greatest names in our literature. The loss
is little to be regretted, since the biographical part of earlier memoirs must have been scanty,
and the criticism inappreciative. Johnson, it may be said, like most of his contemporaries,
considered poetry almost exclusively from the didactic and logical point of view. He always
inquires what is the moral of a work of art. If he does not precisely ask "what it proves,"
he pays excessive attention to the logical solidity and coherence of its sentiments. He condemns
not only insincerity and affectation of feeling, but all such poetic imagery as does not correspond
to the actual prosaic belief of the writer. For the purely musical effects of poetry he has
little or no feeling, and allows little deviation from the alternate long and short syllables
neatly bound in Pope's couplets.

To many readers this would imply that Johnson omits precisely the poetic element in poetry.
I must be here content to say that in my opinion it implies rather a limitation than a fundamental
error. Johnson errs in supposing that his logical tests are at all adequate; but it is, I think,
a still greater error to assume that poetry has no connexion, because it has not this kind
of connexion, with philosophy. His criticism has always a meaning, and in the case of works
belonging to his own school a very sound meaning. When he is speaking of other poetry, we can
only reply that his remarks may be true, but that they are not to the purpose.

The remarks on the poetry of Dryden, Addison, and Pope are generally excellent, and always
give the genuine expression of an independent judgment. Whoever thinks for himself, and says
plainly what he thinks, has some merit as a critic. This, it is true, is about all that can
be said for such criticism as that on Lycidas, which is a delicious example of the wrong way
of applying strong sense to inappropriate topics. Nothing can be truer in a sense, and nothing
less relevant.

This is of course utterly outrageous, and yet much of it is undeniably true. To explain why,
in spite of truth, Lycidas is a wonderful poem, would be to go pretty deeply into the theory
of poetic expression. Most critics prefer simply to shriek, being at any rate safe from the
errors of independent judgment.

The general effect of the book, however, is not to be inferred from this or some other passages
of antiquated and eccentric criticism. It is the shrewd sense everywhere cropping up which
is really delightful. The keen remarks upon life and character, though, perhaps, rather too
severe in tone, are worthy of a vigorous mind, stored with much experience of many classes,
and braced by constant exercise in the conversational arena. Passages everywhere abound which,
though a little more formal in expression, have the forcible touch of his best conversational
sallies. Some of the prejudices, which are expressed more pithily in Boswell, are defended
by a reasoned exposition in the Lives. Sentence is passed with the true judicial air; and if
he does not convince us of his complete impartiality, he at least bases his decisions upon
solid and worthy grounds. It would be too much, for example, to expect that Johnson should
sympathize with the grand republicanism of Milton, or pardon a man who defended the execution
of the blessed Martyr. He failed, therefore, to satisfy the ardent admirers of the great poet.
Yet his judgment is not harsh or ungenerous, but, at worst, the judgment of a man striving
to be just, in spite of some inevitable want of sympathy.

The quality of Johnson's incidental remarks may be inferred from one or two brief extracts.
Here is an observation which Johnson must have had many chances of verifying.

Here is another shrewd comment upon the compliments paid to Halifax, of whom Pope says in the
character of Bufo,--

  Fed with soft dedications all day long,
  Horace and he went hand and hand in song.

Johnson's best poetry is the versified expression of the tone of sentiment with which we are
already familiar. The Vanity of Human Wishes is, perhaps, the finest poem written since Pope's
time and in Pope's manner, with the exception of Goldsmith's still finer performances. Protect a course
