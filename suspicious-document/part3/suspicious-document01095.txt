Or, if none of these functions or festivals were taking place, and only one or two old cronies
had dropped in on their way from the Club, and had drawn up their chairs close to the dining-room
table, and you had happened to be hanging up your hat in the hall at that moment, you would
have been conscious of an aroma as delicate in flavor as that wafted across summer seas from
far-off tropic isles; of pomegranates, if you will, ripening by crumbling walls; of purple
grapes drinking in the sun; of pine and hemlock; of sweet spices and the scent of roses. or
any other combination of delightful things which your excited imagination might suggest.

You would have known then just what had taken place; how, when the gentlemen were seated, Malachi
in his undress blue coat and brass buttons had approached his master noiselessly from behind,
and with a gravity that befitted the occasion had bent low his head, his hands behind his back,
his head turned on one side, and in a hushed voice had asked this most portentous question:

"Which Madeira, Marse Richard?"

The only answer would have been a lifting of the eyebrow and an imperceptible nod of his master's
head in the direction of the mahogany cellaret.

Malachi understood.

It was the Tiernan of '29.

And that worthy "Keeper of the Privy Seal and Key," pausing for an instant with his brown jug
of a head bent before the cellaret, as a Mohammedan bends his head before a wall facing Mecca,
had there- upon unlocked its secret chambers and had produced a low, deeply cut decanter topped
by a wondrous glass stopper. This he had placed, with conscious importance,  on a small table
before the two or three devotees  gathered together in its honor, and the host, removing the
stopper, had filled the slender glasses with a vintage that had twice rounded the Cape-- a
wine of such rare lineage and flavor that those who had the honor of its acquaintance always
spoke of it as one of the most precious possessions of the town-- a wine, too, of so delicate
an aroma that those within the charmed circle invariably lifted the thin glasses and dreamily
inhaled its perfume before they granted their palates a drop.

Ah, those marvellous, unforgettable aromas that come to me out of the long ago with all the
reminders they bring of clink of glass and touch of elbow, of happy boys and girls and sweet
old faces. it is forty years since they greeted my nostrils in the cool, bare, uncurtained
hall of the old house in Kennedy Square, but they are still fresh in my memory. Sometimes it
is the fragrance of newly made gingerbread, or the scent of creamy custard with just a suspicion
of peach-kernels; sometimes it is the scent of fresh strawberries--strawberries that meant
the spring, not the hot-house or Bermuda--and sometimes it is the smell of roasted oysters
or succulent canvas-backs! Forty years ago--and yet even to-day the perfume of a roasted apple
never greets me but I stand once more in the old-fashioned room listening to the sound of Nathan's
flute; I see again the stately, silver-haired, high-bred mistress of the mansion with her kindly
greeting, as she moves among her guests; I catch the figure of that old darkey with his brown,
bald head and the little tufts of gray wool fringing its sides, as he shuffles along in his
blue coat and baggy white waistcoat and much-too-big gloves, and I hear the very tones of his
voice as he pushes his seductive tray before me and whispers, confidentially:

"Take a li'l ob de apple, sah; dat's whar de real 'spression oh de toddy is."

CHAPTER II

STRAINS FROM NATHAN'S FLUTE

It was one of those Friday evenings, then, when the smell of roast apples steeping in hot toddy
came wafting out the portals of Malachi's pantry--a smell of such convincing pungency that
even the most infrequent  of frequenters having once inhaled it, would have known at the first
whiff that some musical function  was in order. The night was to be one of unusual interest.

Nathan Gill and Max linger were expected, and Miss Lavinia Clendenning, completing with Richard
a quartette for 'cello, flute, piano, and violin, for which Unger had arranged Beethoven's
Overture to "Fidelio."

Nathan, of course, arrived first. On ordinary occasions  another of those quaint ceremonies
for which the house was famous would always take place when the old flute-player entered the
drawing-room--a ceremony  which brought a smile to the lips of those who had watched it for
years, and which to this day brings one to those who recall it. Nathan, with a look of quizzical
anxiety on his pinched face, would tiptoe cautiously into the room, peering about to make sure
of Richard's presence, his thin, almost transparent fingers outspread before him to show Richard
that they were empty. Richard would step forward and, with a tone of assumed solicitude in
his voice, would say:

"Don't tell me, Nathan, that you have forgotten your flute?" and Nathan, pausing for a moment,
would suddenly break into a smile, and with a queer little note of surprise in his throat,
and a twinkle in his eye, would make answer by slowly drawing from his coat-tail pocket the
three unjointed pieces, holding  them up with an air of triumph and slowly putting them together.
Then these two old "Merry-Andrews"  would lock arms and stroll into the library, laughing like
school-boys.

To-night, however, as Nathan had been specially invited to play, this little ceremony was omitted.
On entering the hall the musician gave his long, black, pen-wiper cloak and his hat to Malachi,
and supporting  himself by his delicate fingers laid flat on the hall-table, extended first
one thin leg, and then the other, while that obsequious darky unbuttoned his gaiters. His feet
free, he straightened himself up, pulled the precious flute from his coat-tail pocket and carefully
joined the parts. This done, he gave a look into the hall-mirror, puffed out his scarf, combed
his straight white hair forward over his ears with his fingers, and at Malachi's announcement
glided through the open doorway to Mrs. Horn's chair, the flute in his hand held straight out
as an orator would have held his roll.

The hostess, who had been sitting by the fire, her white gossamer shawl about her spare shoulders,
rose from her high-backed chair and, laying aside her knitting-needles and wools, greeted the
musician with as much cordiality--and it must be confessed with as much ceremony--as if she
had not seen him a dozen times that week. One of the charms of the Horn mansion lay in these
delightful blendings of affection and formality.

"Am I a little early?" he asked with as much surprise as if he were not as certain to be early
when music was concerned as he was to be late in everything else. "Yes, my dear madam--I see
that I am early, unless Miss Lavinia is late."

"You never could be too early, Nathan. Lavinia will be here in a moment," she answered, with
a smile, resuming her seat.

"I'm glad that I'm ahead of her for once," he replied, laughing. Then, turning to the inventor,
who had come forward from where he had been studying the new score, he laid his hand affectionately
on Richard's shoulder, as a boy would have done, and added: "How do you like Unger's new arrangement?--I've
been thinking of nothing else all day."

"Capital! Capital!" answered Richard, slipping his arm into Nathan's, and drawing him closer
to the piano. "See how he has treated this adagio phrase," and he followed the line with his
finger, humming the tune to Nathan. "The modulation, you see, is from E Major to A Major, and
the flute sustains the melody, the effect is so peculiarly soft and the whole so bright with
passages of sunshine all through it --oh, you will love it."

While these two white-haired enthusiasts with their heads together were studying the score,
beating  time with their hands, after the manner of experts  to whom all the curious jumble
of dots and lines that plague so many of us are as plain as print, Malachi was receiving Miss
Clendenning in the hall. Indeed, he had answered her knock as Nathan was passing into the drawing-room.

The new arrival bent her neck until Malachi had relieved her of the long hooded cloak, gave
a quick stamp with her little feet as she shook out her balloon  skirts, and settled herself
on the hall-settee while Malachi unwound the white worsted "nubia" from her aristocratic throat.
This done, she, too, held a short consultation with the hall-mirror, carefully  dusting, with
her tiny handkerchief, the little pats of powder still left on her cheeks, and with her jewelled
fingers smoothing the soft hair parted over her forehead, and tightening meanwhile the side-
combs that kept in place the clusters of short curls which framed her face. Then, with head
erect and a gracious recognition of the old servant's ministrations,  she floated past Malachi,
bent double in her honor.

"Oh, I heard you, Nathan," she laughed, waving her fan toward him as she entered the room.
"I'm not one minute late. Did you ever hear such impudence,  Sallie, and all because he reached
your door one minute before me," she added, stooping to kiss Mrs. Horn. Punctuality was one
of the cardinal virtues of this most distinguished, prim, precise, and most lovable of old
maids. "You are really getting to be dreadful, Mr. Nathan Gill, and so puffed up --isn't he,
Richard?" As she spoke she turned abruptly and faced both gentlemen. Then, with one of her
rippling laughs--a laugh that Richard always said reminded him of the notes of a bird--she
caught her skirts in her fingers, made the most sweeping of courtesies and held out her hands
to the two gentlemen  who were crossing the room to meet her.

Richard, with the bow of a Cavalier, kissed the one offered him as gallantly as if she had
been a duchess, telling her he had the rarest treat in store for her as soon as Unger came,
and Nathan with mock devotion held the other between his two palms, and said that to be scolded
by Miss Clendenning was infinitely better than being praised by anybody else. These pleasantries
over, the two old gallants returned to the piano to wait for Max Unger and to study again the
crumpled pages of the score which lay under the soft light of the candles.

The room relapsed once more into its wonted quiet, broken only by the whispered talk of well-bred
people  careful not to disturb each other. Mrs. Horn had begun to knit again. Miss Clendenning
stood facing the fire, one foot resting on the fender.

This wee foot of the little lady was the delight and admiration of all the girls about Kennedy
Square, and of many others across the seas, too-- men and women for that matter. To-night it
was encased in a black satin slipper and in a white spider- web stocking, about which were
crossed two narrow black ribbons tied in a bow around the ankle--such a charming little slipper
peeping out from petticoats all bescalloped and belaced! Everything in fact about this dainty
old maid, with her trim figure filling  out her soft white fichu, still had that subtlety of
charm which had played havoc with more than one heart in her day. Only Sallie Horn, who had
all the dear woman's secrets, knew where those little feet had stepped and what hopes they
had crushed. Only Sallie Horn, too, knew why the delicate finger was still bare of a plain
gold ring. The world never thought it had made any difference to Miss Lavinia, but then the
world had never peeped under the lower lid of Miss Clendenning's heart.

Suddenly the hushed quiet of the room was broken by a loud knock at the front door, or rather
by a series of knocks, so quick and sharp that Malachi started from his pantry on the run.

"That must be Max," said Richard. "Now, Lavinia,  we will move the piano, so as to give you
more room."

Mrs. Horn pushed back her chair, rose to her feet, and stood waiting to receive the noted 'cellist,
without  whom not a note could be sounded, and Miss Clendenning took her foot from the fender
and dropped her skirts.

But it was not Max!

Not wheezy, perspiring old Max Unger after all, walking into the room mopping his face with
one hand and with the other lugging his big 'cello, embalmed  in a green baize bag--he would
never let Malachi touch it--not Max at all, but a fresh, rosy- cheeked young fellow of twenty-two,
who came bounding in with a laugh, tossing his hat to Malachi --a well-knit, muscular young
fellow, with a mouth full of white teeth and a broad brow projecting over two steel-blue eyes
that were snapping with fun.

With his coming the quiet of the place departed and a certain breezy atmosphere permeated the
room as if a gust of cool wind had followed him. With him, too, came a hearty, whole-souled
joyousness-- a joyousness of so sparkling and so radiant a kind that it seemed as if all the
sunshine he had breathed for twenty years in Kennedy Square had somehow been stored away in
his boyish veins.

"Oh, here you are, you dear Miss Lavinia," he cried out, his breath half gone from his dash
across the Square. "How did you get here first?"

"On my two feet, you stupid Oliver," cried Miss Lavinia, shaking her curls at him. "Did you
think somebody carried me?"

"No, I didn't; but that wouldn't be much to carry, Miss Midget." His pet name for her. "But
which way did you come? I looked up and down every path and--"

"And went all the way round by Sue Clayton's to find me, didn't you? Oh, you can't throw dust
in the Midget's eyes, you young rascal!" and she stretched up her two dainty hands; drew his
face toward her, and kissed him on the lips.

"There--" and she patted his cheek-- "now tell me all about it, you dear Ollie. What did you
want to see me for?" she added with one of those quick divinations that made her so helpful
a confidante.  Then, in a lowered voice-- "What has Sue done?"

"Nothing--not one thing. She isn't bothering her head about me. I only stopped there to leave
a book, and--"

Mrs. Horn, with laughing, inquiring eyes, looked up from her chair at Miss Clendenning, and
made a little doubting sound with her lips. Black-eyed Sue Clayton, with her curls down her
back, home from boarding-school for the Easter holidays, was Oliver's latest flame. His mother
loved to tease him about his love-affairs; and always liked him to have a new one. She could
see farther into his heart she thought when the face of some sweet girl lay mirrored in its depths.

Oliver heard the doubting sound his mother made, and, reaching over her chair, flung his arms
about her neck and kissed her as if she had been a girl.

"Now, don't you laugh, you dear old motherkins," he cried, drawing her nearer to him until
her face touched his. "Sue don't care a thing about me, and I did promise her the book, and
I ran every step of the way to give it to her--didn't I, Uncle Nat?" he added, gayly, hoping
to divert the topic. "You were behind the sun-dial when I passed--don't you remember?"  He
shrank a little from the badinage.

The old musician heard the question, but only waved his flute behind him in answer. He did
not even lift his head from beside Richard's at the score.

Oliver waited an instant, and getting no further reply, released his hold about his mother's
neck, now that he had kissed her into silence, and turned to Miss Clendenning again.

"Come, Miss Lavinia--come into the library. I've something very important to talk to you about.
Really, now; no nonsense about it! You've plenty of time--old Max won't be here for an hour,
he's always  late, isn't he, mother?"

Miss Clendenning turned quietly, lifted her eyes in a martyr-like way toward Mrs. Horn, who
shook her head playfully in answer, and with Oliver's arm about her entered the library. She
could never refuse  any one of the young people when they came to her with their secrets--most
important and never- to-be-postponed secrets, of course, that could hardly wait the telling.
Her little tea-room across the Square, with its red damask curtains, its shiny brass andirons,
easy-chairs and lounges, was really more of a confessional than a boudoir. Many a sorrow had
been drowned in the cups of tea that she had served with her own hand in egg-shell Spode cups,
and many a young girl and youth who had entered its cosey interior with heavy hearts had left
it with the sunshine  of a new hope breaking through their tears. But then everybody knew the
bigness of Miss Clendenning's  sympathies. It was one of the things for which they loved her.

She, of course, knew what the boy wanted now. If it were not to talk about Sue Clayton it was
sure to be about some one of the other girls. The young people thought of nothing else but
their love-affairs, and talked of nothing else, and the old people loved to live their youth
over again in listening. It was one of the traditional customs of Kennedy Square.

Miss Clendenning settled herself in a corner of the carved haircloth sofa, touched her side-combs
with her finger to see that they were in place, tucked a red cushion behind her back, crossed
her two little feet on a low stool, the two toes peeping out like the heads of two mice, and
taking Oliver's hand in hers said, in her sweet, coaxing voice:

"Now, you dear boy, it is Sue, isn't it?"

"No!"

"Not Sue? Who then?"

"Mr. Crocker."

"What Mr. Crocker?" She arched her eyebrows and looked at him in surprise. The name came as
a shock. She knew of Mr. Crocker, of course, but she wanted Oliver to describe him. Surely,
she thought, with a sudden sense of alarm, the boy has not fallen in love with the daughter
of that shabby old man.

"Why, the landscape-painter--the one father knows. I have been taking drawing lessons of him
and he says I've got a lot of talent and that all I want is practice. He says that if I begin
now and draw from the cast three or four hours a day that by the end of the year I can begin
in color; and then I can go to New York and study, and then to Paris."

The little lady scrutinized him from under her eyelids. The boy's enthusiasm always delighted
her; she would often forget what he was talking about, so interested was she in following his
gestures as he spoke.

"And what then?"

"Why then I can be a painter, of course. Isn't that a great deal better than sitting every
day in Judge Ellicott's dingy office reading law-books? I hate the law!"

"And you love Mr. Crocker?"

"Yes, don't you?"

"I don't know him, Ollie. Tell me what he is like."

"Well, he isn't young any more. He's about father's age, but he's a splendid old man, and he's
so poor! Nobody buys his pictures, nor appreciates him, and, just think, he has to paint portraits
and dogs and anything he can get to do. Don't you think that's a shame? Nobody goes to see
him but father and Uncle Nat and one or two others. They don't seem to think him a gentleman."
He was putting the case so as to enlist all her sympathies at once.

"He has a daughter, hasn't he?" She was probing him quietly and without haste. Time enough
for her sympathies to work when she got at the facts.

"Yes, but I don't like her very much, for I don't think she's very good to him." Miss Clendenning
smothered a little sigh of relief; there was no danger; thank Heaven, in that direction! What,
then, could he want, she thought to herself.

"And he's so different from anybody I ever met," Oliver continued. "He doesn't talk about horses
and duck-shooting and politics, or music or cards like everyone you meet, except Daddy, but
he talks about pictures and artists and great men. Just think, he was a young student in Dusseldorf
for two years, and then he shouldered a knapsack and tramped all through Switzerland, painting
as he went, and often paying for his lodgings with his sketches. Then he was in Paris for ever
so long, and now he is here, where--"

"Where you tell me he is painting dogs for a living," interrupted Miss Clendenning. "Do you
think, you young scapegrace, that this would be better  than being a lawyer like Judge Ellicott?"
and she turned upon him with one of her quick outbursts of mock indignation.

"But I'm not going to paint dogs," he replied, with some impatience. "I am going to paint women,
like the Sir Peter Lely that Uncle John Tilghman has. Oh, she's a beauty! I took Mr. Crocker
to see her the other day. It had just been brought in from the country, you know. You should
have heard him go on. He says there's nobody who can paint a portrait  like it nowadays. He
raved about her. You know it is Uncle John Tilghman's grandmother when she was a girl." His
voice suddenly dropped to a more serious tone as he imparted this last bit of information.

Miss Clendenning knew whose grandmother it was, and knew and loved every tone in the canvas.
It had hung in the Tilghman Manor-House for years and was one of its most precious treasures,
but she did not intend to stop and discuss it now.

"Mr. Crocker wants me to copy it just as soon as I draw a little better. Uncle John will let
me, I know."

Miss Clendenning tapped her foot in a noiseless tattoo upon the stool, and for a time looked
off into space. She wanted to draw him out, to know from what depth this particular enthusiasm
had sprung. She was accustomed to his exuberance of spirits, it was one of the many things
she loved him for. If this new craze were but an idle fancy, and he had had many of them, it
would wear itself out, and the longer they talked about it the better. If, however, it sprang
from an inborn taste, and was the first  indication of a hitherto undeveloped talent forcing
itself  to the surface, the situation was one demanding the greatest caution. Twigs like Oliver
bent at the wrong time might never straighten out again.

"And why did you come to me about this, Ollie; why don't you talk to your father?"

"I have. He doesn't object. He says that Mr. Crocker is one of the rare men of the time, and
that only inexperience among the people here prevents him from being appreciated. That's what
he goes to see him for. It isn't father that worries me, it's mother. I know just whet she'll
say. She's got her heart set on my studying law, and she won't listen to anything else. I wouldn't
object to the law if I cared for it, but I don't. That's what makes it come so hard."

"And you want me to speak to your mother?"

"Yes, of course. That's just what I DO want you to do. Nobody can help me but you," he cried
with that coaxing manner which would have seemed effeminate until one looked at his well-built,
muscular  body and the firm lines about his mouth. "You tell her of all the painters you knew
in London when you lived there, and of what they do and how they are looked up to, and that
some of them are gentlemen  and not idlers and loafers. Mother will listen to you, I know,
and maybe then when I tell her it won't be such a shock to her. Do you know it is incomprehensible
to me, all this contempt for people who don't do just the same things that their grandfathers
did. And how do I know, too, that they are right about it all? It seems to me that when a man
is born a gentleman and is a gentleman he can follow any occupation he pleases. Instead of
his trade making  him respectable he should make IT so." He spoke with a virility she had never
suspected in him before, this boy whom she had held in her arms as a baby and who was still
only the child to her.

"But, Ollie," she interrupted, in some surprise, "you must never forget that you are your father's
son. No one is absolutely independent in this world; everyone has his family to consider."
She was becoming  not only interested now, but anxious. Mr. Crocker had evidently been teaching
the boy something  besides the way to use his pencil. Such democratic  ideas were rare in Kennedy
Square.

"Yes, I know what you mean." He had sprung from his seat now and was standing over her, she
looking up into his face. "You mean that it is all right for me to go into old Mr. Wardell's
counting- house because he sells coffee by the cargo, but that I can't take a situation in
Griggson's grocery here on the corner because he sells coffee by the pound. You mean, too,
that it is possible for a man to be a professor  or president of a college and still be a gentleman,
but if he teaches in the public school he is done for. You mean, too, that I could saw off
a patient's leg and still be invited to Uncle Tilghman's house to dinner, but that if I pulled
out one of his teeth I could only eat in his kitchen."

Miss Clendenning threw back her head and laughed until the combs in her side-curls needed refastening,
but she did not interrupt him.

"I can't get this sort of thing into my head and I never will. And father doesn't believe in
it any more than I do, and I don't think that mother would if it wasn't for a lot of old people
who live around this square and who talk of nothing all day but their relations and think there's
nobody worth knowing but themselves. Now, you've GOT to talk to mother; I won't take no for
an answer," and he threw himself  down beside her again. "Come, dear Midget, hold up your right
hand and promise me now, before  I let you go," he pleaded in his wheedling way that made him
so lovable to his intimates, catching her two hands in his and holding them tight.

Of course she promised. Had she ever refused him anything? And Oliver, a boy again, now that
his confessions were made, kissed her joyously on both cheeks and instantly forgetting his
troubles as his habit was when prospects of relief had opened, he launched out into an account
of a wonderful adventure  Mr. Crocker once had in an old town in Italy, where he was locked
up over-night in a convent  by mistake; and how he had slept on his knapsack  in the chapel,
and what the magistrate had said to him the next day, and how he had to paint a portrait  of
that suspicious officer to prove he was a painter and a man of the best intentions. In his
enthusiasm he not only acted the scene, but he imitated the gesture and dialect of the several
parties to the escapade so perfectly that the little lady, in her delight over the story, quite
forgot her anxiety and even the musicale itself, and only remembered the quartette when Malachi,
bowing obsequiously before her, said:

"Dey's a-waitin' for you, Miss Lavinia. Mister Unger done come and Marse Richard say he can't
wait a minute."

When she and Oliver entered the drawing-room the 'cellist was the centre of the group. He was
stripping off the green baize cover from his instrument  and at the same time was apologizing,
in his broken English, for being so late. Richard was interrupting  him with enthusiastic outbursts
over the new score which still lay under the wax candles lighting  the piano, and which he
and Nathan, while waiting  for the musician, had been silently practising in sundry bobs of
their heads and rhythmic beatings of their hands.

"My dear Max," Richard continued, with a hand on the musician's shoulder, patting him in appreciation
as he spoke, "we will forgive you anything. You have so exactly suited to the 'cello the opening
theme. And the flute passages!--they are exquisitely introduced. We will let Miss Clendenning
decide when she hears it--" and he turned Unger's head in the direction of the advancing lady.
"Here she comes now; you, of course, know the fine quality of Miss Clendenning's ear."

Herr Unger placed his five fat fingers over his waist-baud, bowed as low to Miss Lavinia as
his great girth would permit, and said:

"Ah, yes, I know. Miss Clendenning not only haf de ear she haf de life in de end of de finger.
De piano make de sound like de bird when she touch it."

The little lady thanked him in her sweetest voice, made a courtesy, and extended her hand to
Max, who kissed it with much solemnity, and Richard, putting his arm around the 'cellist's
fat shoulders, conducted him across the room, whereupon Nathan, with the assumed air of an
old beau, offered his crooked elbow to Miss Clendenning as an apology for having reached the
house before her. Then, seating her at the piano with a great flourish, he waved his hand to
Oliver, who had drawn up a chair beside his mother, and with a laugh, cried:

"Here, you young love; come and turn the leaves for Miss Lavinia. It may keep you from running
over other people in the dark, even if they are accused of hiding behind sun-dials."

With the beginning of the overture Mrs. Horn laid down her work, and drawing her white gossamer
shawl about her shoulders gave herself up to the enjoyment  of the music. The overture was
one of her favorites--one she and Richard had often played together as a duet in their younger
days.

Leaning back in her easy-chair with half-closed eyes, her clear-cut features in silhouette
against the glow of the fire, her soft gray curls nestling in the filmy lace that fell about
her temples, she expressed, in every line of her face and figure, that air of graceful  repose
which only comes to those highly favored women who have all their lives been nurtured in a
home of loving hands, tender voices, and noiseless servants--lives of never-ending affection
without care or sorrow.

And yet had you, even as she sat there, studied carefully this central figure of the Horn mansion
--this practical, outspoken, gentle-voiced, tender wife and mother, tenacious of her opinions,
yet big enough and courageous enough to acknowledge her mistakes; this woman, wise in counsel,
sympathetic in sorrow, joyous with the young, restful with the old, you would have discovered
certain lines about her white forehead which advancing years alone could not have accounted for.

These lines seemed all the deeper to-night. Only a few hours before, Richard had come to her,
while Malachi was arranging his clothes, with the joyful news of a new device which he had
developed during the day for his motor. He could hardly wait to tell her, he had said. The
news was anything but joyful to her. She knew what it meant--she knew what sums had been wasted
on the other devices, involving  losses which at this time they could so little  afford. She
was glad, therefore, to free her mind for the moment from these anxieties; glad to sit alone
and drink in the melodies that the quartette set free.

As she sat listening, beating time noiselessly with her thin, upraised hand, her head resting
quietly, a clear, silvery note--clear as a bird's--leaped from Nathan's flute, soared higher
and higher, trembled like a lark poised in air, and died away in tones of such exquisite sweetness
that she turned her head in delight toward the group about the piano, fixing her gaze on Nathan.
The old man's eyes were riveted on the score, his figure bent forward in the intensity of his
absorption, his whole face illumined with the ecstasy that possessed him. Then she looked at
Richard, standing. with his back to her, his violin tucked under his chin, his body swaying
in rhythm with the music. Unger sat next to him, his instrument  between his knees, his stolid,
shiny face unruffled  by the glorious harmonies of Beethoven.

Then her glance rested on Oliver. He was hanging  over the piano whispering in Miss Clendenning's.
ear, his face breaking into smiles at her playful chidings.  If the pathos of the melody had
reached him he showed no sign of its effects.

Instantly there welled up in her heart a sudden gush of tenderness--one of those quick outbursts
that often overwhelm a mother when her eyes rest on a son whose heart is her own--an outburst
all the more intensified by the melody that thrilled her. Why should her heart have been troubled?
Here was her strong hope! Here was her chief reliance! Here the hope of the future. How could
she doubt or suffer when this promise of the coming day was before her in all the beauty and
strength of his young manhood.

With the echoes of Nathan's flute still vibrating in her, and with her mind filled with the
delight of these fresh hopes, she suddenly recalled the anxious look on her boy's face as he
led Miss Clendenning into the library--a new look--one she had never seen before. Still under
the quickening spell of the music she began to exaggerate its cause. What had troubled him?
Why had he told Lavinia, and not her? Was there anything serious?--something he had kept from
her to save her pain?

From this moment her mind became absorbed in her boy. With restless, impatient fingers she
began thrumming on the arm of her chair. Oliver would tell her, she knew, before many hours,
but she could not wait--she wanted to know at once.

With the ending of the first part of the overture, and before the two gentlemen had laid down
their instruments to grasp Unger's hands, she called to Miss Clendenning, who sat at the piano
alone, Oliver having slipped away unobserved.

Miss Clendenning raised her eyes in answer. "Come over and sit by me, dear, while the gentlemen
rest."

Miss Clendenning picked up her white silk mits and fan lying beside the candles, and moved
toward the fireplace. Malachi saw her coming--he was always  in the room during the interludes--and
with an alacrity common to him when the distinguished little lady was present, drew up a low
chair beside his mistress and stood behind it until she took her seat. Miss Clendenning smoothed
out her skirt and settled herself with the movement of a pigeon filling her nest. Then she
laid her mits in her lap and fanned herself softly.

"Well, Sallie, what is it? Did you ever hear Nathan play so well!" she asked, at last.

"What did Oliver want, my dear?" replied Mrs. Horn, ignoring her question. "Is there anything
worrying him, or is Sue at the bottom of it!"

The little woman smiled quizzically. "No, Sallie --not Sue--not this time. That little rattle-brain's
affections will only last the week out. Nothing very important--that is, nothing urgent. We
were talking  about the Tilghman portraits and the Lely that Cousin John has brought into town
from Claymore  Manor, and what people should and should not do to earn their living, and what
professions were respectable. I thought one thing and Ollie thought another. Now, what profession
of all others would you choose for a young man starting out in life?"

"What has he been telling you, Lavinia? Does he want to leave Judge Ellicott's office?" Mrs.
Horn asked, quietly, She always went straight to the root of any matter.

"Just answer my question, Sallie."

"I'd rather he'd be a lawyer, of course; why?"

"Suppose he won't, or can't?"

"Is that what he told you, Lavinia, on the sofa?" She was leaning forward, her cheek on her
hand, her eyes fixed on the blazing logs.

"He told me a great many things, half of them boy's talk. Now answer my question; suppose he
couldn't study law because his heart wasn't in it, what then?"

"I know, Lavinia, what you mean." There was an anxious tone now in the mother's voice. "And
Oliver talked to you about this?" As she spoke she settled back in her chair and a slight sigh
escaped her.

"Don't ask me, Sallie, for I'm not going to tell you. I want to know for myself what you think,
so that I can help the boy."

Mrs. Horn turned her head and looked toward Richard. She had suspected as much from some hints
that Judge Ellicott had dropped when she had asked him about Oliver's progress. "He is still
holding down his chair, Madam." She thought at the time that it was one of the Judge's witticisms,
but she saw now that it had a deeper meaning. After some moments  she said, fixing her eyes
on Miss Clendenning:

"Well, now, Lavinia, tell me what YOU think. I should like your opinion. What would you wish
to do with him if he were your son?"

Miss Lavinia smiled and her eyes half-closed. For a brief moment there came to her the picture
of what such a blessing would have been. Her son! No! It was always somebody else's son or
daughter to whom her sympathy must go.

"Well, Sallie," she answered--she was leaning over now, her hands in her lap, apparently with
lowered  eyelids, but really watching Mrs. Horn's, face from the corner of her eye--"I don't
think we can make a clergyman out of him, do you?" Mrs. Horn frowned, but she did not interrupt.
"No, we cannot  make a parson out of him. I meant, my love, something in surplices, not in
camp-meetings, of course. Think of those lovely pink cheeks in a high collar and Bishop's sleeves,
wouldn't he be too sweet for anything?" and she laughed one of her little cooing  laughs. "Nor
a doctor," she continued, with a slight interrogation in her tone, "nor a shopkeeper,  nor
a painter"--and she shot a quick glance from under her arching eyebrows at her companion --but
Mrs. Horn's face gave no sign--"nor a musician.  Why not a musician, Sallie, he sings like
an angel, you know?" She was planting her shafts all about the target, her eyes following the
flight of each arrow.

Mrs. Horn raised her head and laid her hand firmly on Miss Clendenning's wrist.

"We won't have him a shopkeeper, Lavinia," she said with some positiveness, "nor a barber,
nor a painter, nor a cook, nor a dentist. We'll try and keep him a gentleman, my dear, whatever
happens. As for his being a musician, I think you will agree with me, that music is only possible
as an accomplishment,  never when it is a profession. Look at that dear old man over there"--and
she pointed to Nathan,  who was bending forward running over on his flute some passages from
the score, his white hair covering his coat-collar behind--"so absolutely unfitted  for this
world as he is, so purposeless, so hopelessly  inert. He breathes his whole soul into that
flute and yet--"

"And a good deal comes out of it sometimes, my dear--to-night, for instance," laughed Miss
Lavinia. "Did you catch those bird-like notes?"

"Yes, and they thrilled me through and through, but sweet as they are they haven't helped him
make a career."

At this moment Richard called to Unger, who had been sitting on the sofa in the library, "cooling
off," he said, as he mopped his head with a red handkerchief,  one of Malachi's cups in his hand.

Miss Lavinia caught sight of the 'cellist's advancing  figure and rose from her seat. "I must
go now," she said, "they want to play it again." She moved a step forward, gave a glance at
her side-curls in the oval mirror over the mantel, stopped hesitatingly, and then bending over
Mrs. Horn said, thoughtfully, her hand on her companion's shoulder, "Sallie, don't try to make
water run uphill. If Ollie belonged to me I'd let him follow his tastes, whatever they were.
You'll spoil the shape of his instep if you keep him wearing Chinese shoes," and she floated
over to join the group of musicians.

Mrs. Horn again settled herself in her chair. She understood now the look on Oliver's face.
She was right then; something was really worrying him. The talk with Miss Lavinia had greatly
disturbed her--. so much so that she could not listen to the music. Again her eyes rested on
Oliver, who had come in and joined the group at the piano, all out of breath with his second
run across the Square--this time to tell Sue of Miss Clendenning's promise. He was never happy
unless he was sharing what was on his mind with another, and if there was a girl within reach
he was sure to pour it into her willing ears.

Mrs. Horn looked at him with a pang about her heart. From which side of the house had come
this fickleness, this instability and love of change in Oliver's character? she asked herself--a
new interest  every day--all the traditions of his forefathers violated. How could she overcome
it in him? how make him more practical? Years before, when she had thought him proud, she had
sent him to market and had made him carry home the basket on his arm, facing the boys who laughed
at him. He had never forgotten the lesson; he was neither proud nor lazy any more. But what
could she do in a situation like this?

Harassed by these doubts her eyes wandered over Oliver's slender, well-knit muscular figure
as he stood whispering to Miss Clendenning. She noticed the fine, glossy hair brushed from
the face and worn long in the neck, curling behind the ears. She noted every movement of his
body: the graceful way in which he talked with his hands, using his fingers to accentuate his
words, and the way in which he shrugged his shoulders--the shrug of a Frenchman, although not
a drop of their blood could be found in his veins--and in the quick lifting of the hand and
the sidelong glance of the eye, all so characteristic of Richard when some new thought or theory
reached his brain for the first time. Gradually and unconsciously  she began to compare each
feature of Oliver's face with that of the father who stood beside him: the alert blue, eyes;
overhanging brow and soft silkiness  of the hair--identically the name, even the way it lay
in the neck. And again she looked at Richard, drawing the bow as if in a dream.

Instantly a thought entered her mind that drove the blood from her cheeks. These vacillations
of her husband's! This turning from one thing to another --first the law, then these inventions
that never lead anywhere, and now Oliver beginning in the same way, almost in the same steps!
Could these traits be handed down to the children? Would Oliver  be like Richard in----

Instinctively she stopped short before the disloyal thought could form itself in her brain,
straightened herself in her chair, and closed her lips tight.

The music ceased; Nathan laid his flute on the piano; Unger rose. from his seat, and Richard
turned to talk to Miss Clendenning. But she was unmindful of it all--she still sat in her chair,
her eyes searching the blazing logs, her hands in her lap.

Only Malachi with his silver tray recalled her to consciousness.

CHAPTER III

THE OPEN-AIR DRAWING-ROOMS OF KENNIDY SQUARE

If in the long summer days Kennedy Square was haunted by the idle and the weary, in the cool
summer  nights its dimly lighted paths were alive with the tread of flying feet, and its shadowy
benches gay with the music of laughter and merry greetings.

With the going down of the sun, the sidewalks were sprinkled, and the whole street about the
Square watered from curb to curb, to cool its sun-baked cobbles. The doors and windows of all
the houses were thrown wide to welcome the fresh night-air, laden with the perfume of magnolia,
jasmine, and sweet-smelling box. Easy-chairs and cushions were brought out and placed on the
clean steps of the porches, and the wide piazzas covered with squares of china-matting to make
ready for the guests of the evening.

These guests would begin to gather as soon as the twilight settled; the young girls in their
pretty muslin  frocks and ribbons, the young men in white duck suits and straw hats. They thronged
the cool, well- swept paths, chattered in bunches under the big trees, or settled like birds
on the stone seats and benches. Every few minutes some new group, fresh from their tea-tables,
would emerge from one of the houses, poise like a flock of pigeons on the top step, listen
to the guiding sound of the distant laughter, and then swoop down in mad frolic, settling in
the midst of the main covey, under the big sycamores until roused at the signal of some male
bird in a straw hat, or in answer to the call of some bare-headed songstress from across the
Square, the whole covey would dash out one of the rickety gates, only to alight again on the
stone steps of a neighbor's porch, where their chatter and pipings would last far into the night.

It was extraordinary how, from year to year, these young birds and even the old ones remembered
the best perches about the Square. On Colonel Clayton's  ample portico--big enough to shelter
half a dozen covies behind its honeysuckles--both young and old would settle side by side;
the younger bevy hovering about the Judge's blue-eyed daughter--a bird so blithe and of so
free a wing, that the flock always followed wherever she alighted. On Judge Bowman's wide veranda
only a few old cocks from the club could be found, and not infrequently, some rare birds from
out of town perched about a table alive with the clink of glass and rattle of crushed ice,
while next the church, on old Mrs. Pancoast's portico,  with its tall Corinthian columns--Mr.
Pancoast was the archdeacon of the Noah's ark church--one or two old grandmothers and a grave
old owl of a family doctor were sure to fill the rocking-chairs. As for Richard Horn's marble
steps they were never free from stray young couples who flew in to rest on Malachi's chairs
and cushions. Sometimes only one bird and her mate would be tucked away in the shadow of the
doorway; sometimes only an old pair, like Mrs. Horn and Richard, would occupy its corners.

These porticoes and stone door-steps were really the open-air drawing-rooms of Kennedy Square
in the soft summer nights. Here ices were served and cool drinks--sherbets for the young and
juleps and sherry cobblers for the old. At the Horn house, on great occasions, as when some
big melon that had lain for days on the cool cellar floor was cut (it was worth a day's journey
to see Malachi cut a melon), the guests would not only crowd the steps, but all the hall and
half up the slender staircase, where they would sit with plates in their laps, the young men
serving their respective sweethearts.

This open-air night-life had gone on since Kennedy  Square began; each door-step had its habitues
and each veranda its traditions. There was but one single porch, in fact, facing its stately
trees whereon no flocks of birds, old or young, ever alighted, and that belonged to Peter Skimmerton--the
meanest man in town--who in a fit of parsimony over candles, so the girls said, had bared his
porch of every protesting  vine and had placed opposite his door-step a glaring street gas-lamp---a
monstrous and never-to- be-forgotten affront.

And yet, free and easy as the life was, no stranger sat himself down on any one of these porches
until his pedigree had been thoroughly investigated, no matter how large might be his bank-account
nor how ambitious his soarings. No premeditated discourtesy ever initialed this exclusiveness
and none was ever intended. Kennedy Square did not know the blood of the stranger--that was
all--and not knowing it they could not trust him. And it would have been altogether  useless
for him to try to disguise his antecedents --especially if he came from their own State-- or
any State south of it. His record could be as easily reached and could be as clearly read as
a title- deed. Even the servants knew. Often they acted as Clerks of the Rolls.

"Dat Mister Jawlins, did you ask 'bout?" Malachi would say. "Why you know whar he comes f'om.
He's one o' dem Anne Rundle Jawlinses. He do look mighty peart an' dey do say he's mighty rich,
but he can't fool Malachi. I knowed his gran'pa," and that wise and politic darky, with the
honor of the house before his eyes, would shake his head knowingly  and with such an ominous
look, that had you not known the only crime of the poor grandfather to have been a marriage
with his overseer's daughter-- a very worthy woman, by the way--instead of with some lady of
quality, you would have supposed he had added the sin of murder to the crime of low birth.
On the other hand, had you asked Malachi about some young aristocrat who had forgotten to count
his toddies the night before, that Defender of the Faith would have replied:

"Lawd bress ye! Co'se dese young gemmens like to frolic--an' dey do git dat way sometimes--tain't
nuthin'. Dem Dorseys was allers like dat--" the very tones of his voice carrying such convictions
of the young man's respectability that you would have felt safe in keeping a place at your
table for the  delinquent, despite your knowledge of his habits.

This general intimacy between the young people, and this absolute faith of their elders in
the quality of family blood, was one of the reasons why every man about Kennedy Square was
to be trusted with every other man's sister, and why every mother gave the latch-key to every
other mother's son, and why it made no difference whether the young people came home early
or late, so that they all came home when the others did. If there were love-making--and of
course there was love-making--it was of the old- fashioned, boy-and-girl kind, with keepsakes
and pledges and long walks in the afternoons and whispered  secrets at the merry-makings. Never
anything else. Woe betide the swain who forgot himself ever so slightly--there was no night-key
for him after that, nor would any of the girls on any front steps in town ever look his way
again when he passed-- and to their credit be it said, few of the young men either. From that
day on the offender became  a pariah. He had committed the unpardonable sin.

As for these young men, this life with the girls was all the life they knew. There were fishing
parties,  of course, at the "Falls" when the gudgeons were biting, and picnics in the woods;
and there were oyster roasts in winter, and watermelon parties in summer--but the girls must
he present, too. For in those simple days there were no special clubs with easy-chairs and
convenient little tables loaded with drinkables and smokables--none for the young Olivers,
and certainly none for the women. There was, to be sure, in every Southern city an old mausoleum
of a club--sometimes two--each more desolate than the other--haunted by gouty old parties and
bonvivants; but the young men never passed through their doors except on some call of urgency.
When a man was old enough to be admitted to the club there was no young damosel on Malachi's
steps, or any other steps, who would care a rap about him. HIS day was done.

For these were the days in which the woman ruled in court and home---championed by loyal retainers
who strove hourly to do her bidding. Even the gray- haired men would tell you over their wine
of some rare woman whom they had known in their youth, and who was still their standard of
all that was gentle and gracious, and for whom they would claim a charm of manner and stately
comeliness that--"my dear sir, not only illumined her drawing-room but conferred distinction
on the commonwealth."

"Mrs. Tilghman's mother, were you talking about?" Colonel Clayton or Richard Horn, or some
other old resident would ask. "I remember her perfectly.  We have rarely had a more adorable
woman, sir. She was a vision of beauty, and the pride of our State for years."

Should some shadow have settled upon any one of these homes--some shadow of drunkenness, or
love of play, or shattered brain, or worse--the woman bore the sorrow in gentleness and patience
and still loved on and suffered and loved and suffered again, hoping against hope. But no dry
briefs were ever permitted  to play a part, dividing heart and hearth. Kennedy Square would
have looked askance had such things been suggested or even mentioned in its presence,  and
the dames would have lowered their voices in discussing them. Even the men would have passed
with unlifted hats either party to such shame.

Because of this loyalty to womankind and this reverence for the home--a reverence which began
with the mother-love and radiated to every sister they knew--no woman of quality ever earned
her own bread while there was an able-bodied man of her blood above ground to earn it for her.
Nor could there be any disgrace so lasting, even to the third and fourth generation, as the
stigma an outraged  community would place upon the renegade who refused her aid and comfort.
An unprogressive, quixotic life if you will--a life without growth and dominant personalities
and lofty responsibilities and God-given rights--but oh! the sweet mothers that it gave us,
and the wholesomeness, the cleanliness, the loyalty of it all.

With the coming of summer, then, each white marble  step of the Horn mansion, under Malachi's
care, shone like a china plate.

"Can't hab dese yere young ladies spile dere clean frocks on Malachi's steps--no, sah," he
would say; "Marse Oliver'd r'ar an' pitch tur'ble."

There were especial reasons this year for these extra touches of rag and brush. Malachi knew
"de signs" too well to be deceived. Pretty Sue Clayton, with her soft eyes and the mass of
ringlets that framed her face, had now completely taken possession  of Oliver's heart, and
the old servant already had been appointed chief of the postal service--two letters a day sometimes
with all the verbal messages in between.

This love-affair, which had begun in the winter, was not yet of so serious a nature as to cause
distress or unhappiness to either one of their respective houses, nor had it reached a point
where suicide or an elopement were all that was left. It was, in truth, but a few months old,
and so far the banns had not been published. Within the last week Miss Sue had been persuaded
"to wait for him--" that was all. She had not, it is true, burdened her gay young heart with
the number of years of her patience. She and Oliver were sweethearts--that was enough for them
both. As proof of it, was she not wearing about her neck at the very moment a chain which he
had fashioned for her out of cherry-stones; and had she not given him in return one of those
same ringlets, and had she not tied it with a blue ribbon herself? And above all--and what
could be more conclusive-- had she not taken her hair down to do it, and let him select the
very tress that pleased him best?--and was not this curl, at that very moment, concealed in
a pill-box and safely hidden in his unlocked bureau- drawer, where his mother saw it with a
smile the last time she put away his linen? This love-affair--as were the love-affairs of all
the other young people-- was common gossip around Kennedy Square. Had there been any doubts
about it, it would only have been necessary to ask any old Malachi, or Hannah; or Juno. They
could have given every detail of the affair, descanting upon all its joys and its sorrows.

Sweet girls of the days gone by, what crimes some of you have to answer for! At least one of
you must remember how my own thumb was cut into slits over these same cherry-stones, and why
the ends of your ringlets were tucked away in a miniature box in my drawer, with the pressed
flowers and signet-ring, and the rest of it. And you could--if you would--recall a waiting
promise made to me years and years ago. And the wedding! Surely you have not forgotten that.
I was there, you remember--but not as the groom.

On one particular evening in June--an evening that marked an important stage in the development
of Oliver's fortunes--the front porch, owing to Malachi's attentions, was in spotless condition--steps,
knocker, and round silver knobs.

Sue and Oliver sat on the top step; they had stolen across from the Clayton porch on some pretended
errand. Sue's chin was in her hand, and Oliver sat beside her pouring out his heart as he had
never done before. He had realized long ago that she could never understand his wanting to
be a painter as Miss Clendenning had done, and so he had never referred to it since the night
of the musicale, when he had raced across the Square to tell her of his talk with the little
lady. Sue, as he remembered afterward,  had listened abstractedly. She would have preferred
at the time his running in to talk about herself rather than about his queer ambitions. She
was no more interested now.

"Ollie, what does your father say about all this?" she finally asked in a perfunctory way.
"Would he be willing for you to be a painter?" It bored her to listen to Oliver's enthusiastic
talk about light and shade, and color and perspective, and what Mr. Crocker had said and what
Mr. Crocker was doing, and what Mr. Crocker's last portrait was like. She was sure that nobody
else around Kennedy Square talked of such things or had such curious ambitions. They shocked
her as much as Oliver's wearing some outlandish clothes would have done--making him conspicuous
and, perhaps, an object of ridicule.

"Father's all right, Sue. He's always right," Oliver  answered. "He believes in Mr. Crocker,
just as he believes in a lot of things that a good many people  around here don't understand.
He believes the time will come when they will value his pictures, and be proud to own them.
But I don't care who owns mine; I just want the fun of painting them. Just think of what a
man can do with a few tubes of color, a brush, and a bit of canvas. So I don't care if they
never buy what I paint. I can get along somehow, just as Mr. Crocker does. He's poor, but just
see how happy he is. Why, when he does a good thing he's nothing but a boy, he's so glad about
it. I always know how his work has gone when I see his face."

"But, Ollie, he's so shabby, and his daughter gives music-lessons. Nobody THINKS of inviting
her anywhere."  Sue's eyes were shut tight, with an expression  of assumed contempt, and her
little nose was straight up.

"Yes--but that doesn't hurt his pictures, Sue." There was a slight trace of impatience in Oliver's
tone.

"Well, perhaps it doesn't--but you don't want to be like him. I wouldn't like to see you, Ollie,
going about with a picture under your arm that everybody knew you had painted yourself. And
suppose that they would want to buy your pictures? How would you feel now to be taking other
people's money for things you had painted?"

The boy caught his breath. It seemed useless to pursue the talk with Sue. She evidently had
no sympathy with his aspirations.

"No--but I wish I could paint as he does," he answered, mechanically.

Sue saw the change in his manner. She realized, too, that she had hurt him in some way. She
drew nearer and put her hand on his arm.

"Why, you can, Ollie. You can do anything you want to; Miss Lavinia told me so." The little
witch was mistress of one art--that of holding her lover-- but that was an art of which all
the girls about Kennedy  Square approved.

"No, I can't," he replied, forgetting in the caressing  touch of her hand the tribute to his
ability, and delighted that she was once more in sympathy with him. "Mother wouldn't think
of my being an artist. She doesn't understand how I feel about it, and Miss Lavinia, somehow,
doesn't seem to be favorable  to it either. I've talked to her lots of times-- she was more
encouraging at first, but she doesn't seem to like the idea now. I've been hoping she'd fix
it so I could speak to mother about it. Now she tells me I had better wait. I can't see why
Miss Lavinia knows what an artist's life can be, for she knew plenty of painters when she was
in London with her father, and she loves pictures, too, and is a good judge--nobody here any
better. She told me only a week ago how much one of these Englishmen was paid for a little
thing as big as your hand, but I've forgotten the amount. I don't see why I can't paint as
well as those fellows. Do you know, Sue, I'm beginning  to think that about half the people
in Kennedy  Square are asleep? They really don't seem to think there is anything respectable
but the law. If they are right, how about all the men who painted the great pictures and built
all the cathedrals, or the men who wrote all the poems and histories? Mother, of course, wants
me to be a lawyer. Because I'm fitted for it?--not a bit of it! Simply because father was one
before me and his father before him, and Uncle John Tilghman another, and so on back to the
deluge."

Sue drew away a little and turned her head toward the Square as if in search of someone. Oliver
noticed  the movement and his heart sank again. He saw but too clearly how little impression
the story of his ambitions had made upon her. Then the thought flashed into his mind that he
might have offended her in some way, clashing against her traditions and her prejudices as
he had done. He bent toward her and laid his hand in hers.

"Little girl," he said, in a softened tone, "I can't make you unhappy, too. Mother is enough
for me to worry about--I haven't talked it all out to you before, but don't you get a wrong
idea of what I'm going to do--" and he looked up into her face and tightened his hold upon
her fingers, his eyes never wavering from her own.

The girl allowed his hand to remain an instant, then quickly withdrew her own and started up.
Coyness is sometimes fear in the timid heart that is stepping into the charmed circle for the
first time.

"There goes Ella Dorsey and Jack--" she cried, springing down the steps. "Ella! El--la!" and
an answering halloo came back, and the two started from Malachi's steps and raced up the street
to join their young friends.

CHAPTER IV

AN OLD-FASHIONED MORTGAGE

Pretty Sue Clayton with her ringlets and rosy cheeks had not been Oliver's only listener.

His mother had been sitting inside the drawing- room, just beside the open window. She had
spoken to Sue and Oliver when they first mounted the steps, and had begged them both to come
in, but they had forgotten her presence. Unintentionally, therefore, she had heard every word
of the conversation. Her old fears rushed over her again with renewed force. She had never
for a moment supposed that Oliver wanted to be a painter--like Mr. Crocker! Now at last she
understood his real object in talking to Lavinia the night of the musical.

"Richard," she called softly to her husband sitting  in the adjoining room, in the chair that
Malachi, in accordance with the old custom, had with his sweeping bow made ready for him. The
inventor had been there since tea was over, lying back in his seat, his head resting on his
hand. He had had one of his thoughtful days, worrying over some detail of his machine, still
incomplete. The new device of which he had told her with such glee had failed, as had the others.
The motor was still incomplete.

"Richard," she repeated.

"Yes, my dear," he answered, in his gentle voice. He had not heard her at first.

"Bring your chair over here."

The inventor rose instantly and, crossing the room, took a seat beside her, his hand finding
hers in the dark.

"What is this you have been saying to Oliver about artists being great men?" she asked. "He's
got a new idea in his head now--he wants to be a painter. I've thought for some time that Mr.
Crocker was not a proper person for him to be so much with. He has evidently worked on the
boy's imagination until he has determined to give up the law and study art."

"How do you know?"

"I've just heard him tell Sue Clayton so. All he wants now is my consent--he says he has yours."

The inventor paused, and gently smoothed his wife's fingers with his own.

"And you would not give it?" he inquired.

"How could I? It would ruin him--don't you know it?" There was a slight tinge of annoyance
in her voice--not one of fault-finding, but rather of anxiety.

"That depends, my dear, on how well he could succeed," he answered, gently.

"Why, Richard!" She withdrew her hand quickly  from his caressing touch, and looked at him
in undisguised  astonishment. "What has his SUCCEEDING to do with it? Surely you cannot be
in earnest? I am willing he should do anything to make his living,  but not that. No one we
know has ever been a painter. It is neither respectable nor profitable. You see what a dreadful
existence Mr. Crocker leads --hardly an associate in town, and no acquaintances for his daughter,
and he's been painting ever since he was a boy. Oliver could not earn a penny at such work."

"Money is not everything, my dear, nor social recognition. There are many things I would value
more."

"What are they?" She was facing him now, her brows knit, a marked antagonism in her voice.

"Good manners and good taste, Sallie, and kindly consideration for another's feelings," he
answered. He spoke calmly and kindly, as was his custom. He had lived almost all his life with
this high-strung Sallie  Horn, whose eyes flashed now and then as they had done in the old
days when he won her hand. He knew every side of her temperament. "Good manners, and good taste"--he
repeated, as if wishing  to emphasize his thoughts--"Oliver has all of these, and he has, besides,
loyalty to his friends. He never speaks of Mr. Crocker but with affection, and I love to hear
him. That man is an artist of great talent, and yet it seems to be the fashion in this town
to ridicule him. If Ollie has any gifts which would fit him to be a painter, I should be delighted
to see him a painter. It is a profession despised now, as are many others, but it is the profession
of a gentleman,  for all they say, and a noble one!" Then he stopped and said, thoughtfully,
as if communing with himself--"I wish he could be a painter. Since Gilbert Stuart's time we
have had so few men of whom we can boast. This country will one day be proud to honor her artists."

Mrs. Horn sank back in her chair. She felt the hopelessness of all further discussion with
her husband.  "He would not have talked this way ten years ago," she said to herself. "Everything
has gone wrong since he left the law." But to her husband she said:

"You always measure everything by your hopes, Richard, and you never look at the practical
side of anything. Ollie is old enough to begin to think how he will earn his bread. I see now
how hopeless it is for us to try and make a lawyer of him--his heart is not in it. I have come
little by little to the  conclusion that what he wants most is hard work, and he wants it right
away, just as soon as we can find something for him to do--something with his hands, if necessary,
not something full of dreams and imaginings,"  and her voice rose in its earnestness. "I am
getting more and more anxious about him every day," she added, suddenly controlling herself,
"and when you encourage him in foolish vagaries you only make it harder for me, dear," and
her voice softened and broke with emotion.

"He ought to have gone into the laboratory, Sallie,"  Richard added quickly, in a reflective
tone--laying  his hand on her shoulder as he noticed the change of voice--" just as I wanted
him to do when he left school. There is a future for scientific men in this country which you
do not see--a future which few around me seem to see. Great changes are coming, not only in
science, but in the arts and in all useful knowledge. If Ollie can add to the brilliancy of
this future by becoming a brilliant painter, able to help educate those about him, there could
be no higher calling for him. Three things are coming, my dear --perhaps four." The inventor
had risen from his seat and stood beside her, his eyes turned away into the dark as if he were
addressing some unseen person.  "The superseding of steam, aerial locomotion, and the education
of the common people, black and white. One other may come--the freeing of the slaves--but the
others are sure. Science, not money, nor family traditions, nor questions of birth, will shape
the destinies of the country. We may not live to see it, but Oliver will, and I want him to
be where he can help on the movement. You were opposed to his becoming a scientist, and I feel
assured made a mistake. Don't stand in his way again, dear."

"Yes, Richard, I was opposed to it, because I did not want him to waste his time over all sorts
of foolish  experiments, which would certainly--" She did not finish the sentence. Her anxiety
had not yet gone as far as that. With a quick gesture she rose from her chair and drawing her
white gossamer shawl about her shoulders--left the room and walked out onto the front steps,
followed by Richard.

If the inventor heard the thrust he did not reply. He would not argue with his wife over it,
nor did it check the flow of his courtesy. She had never seen the value of what he was striving
for, but she would in time he knew.

"Yes, I think it is cooler out here," was all he said, as he placed a cushion to soften her
seat on the threshold. When he had arranged another pillow  behind her back and hunted round
the dark parlor  for a stool for her feet, he found a chair for himself and sat down beside
her. She thanked him, but her thoughts were evidently far away. She was weighing in her mind
what must be her next move if Oliver persisted in this new departure. Richard broke the silence.

"I haven't told you of the good offer I've had for the farm, Sallie."

"No, but we're not going to sell it, of course." She was leaning back against the jamb of the
door as she spoke, the shawl hanging loose, her delicate white hands in her lap. It was an
idle answer to an idle question, for her mind was still with Oliver.

"Well, I hadn't thought of doing so until to-day," he answered, slowly, "but I had a notice
from the bank that they must call in the mortgage, and so I thought I might as well sell the
whole place, pay off the debt, and use the balance for--"

"Sell the farm, Richard?" It was her hand now that sought his, and with a firm grasp as if
she would restrain him then and there in his purpose.

"Yes, I can get several thousand dollars over and above the mortgage, and I need the money,
Sallie. It will only be a temporary matter--" and he smoothed her arm tenderly, speaking as
a lover of long standing might do who is less absorbed with the caress than with the subject
under discussion. "The motor will be ready in a few weeks--as soon as the new batteries are
finished. Then, my dear, you won't have to curtail your expenses as you have done." His voice
was full of hope now, a smile lighting his face as he thought of all the pleasure and comfort
his success would bring her.

"But you said that same thing when you were working on the steam-valve, for which you put that
very mortgage on the farm, and now that's all gone and--"

"The failure of the steam-valve, as I have always told you, was due to my own carelessness,
Sallie. I should have patented it sooner. They are making enormous sums on it, I hear, and
are using my cut- off, and I think dishonestly. But the motor has been protected at every new
step that I have taken. My first patent of August 13, 1856, supersedes all others, and cannot
be shaken. Now, my dear, don't worry about it--you have never known me to fail, and I won't
now. Besides, you forget my successes, Sallie--the turbine water-wheel and the others. It will
all come, right."

"It will never come right." She had risen from her seat, and was standing over, him, both hands
on his shoulders, her eyes looking down into his, her voice trembling. "Oh, Richard, Richard!
Give up this life of dreams you are living, and go back to your law-office. You always succeeded
in the law. This new career of yours is ruining us. I can economize,  dear, just as I have
always done," she added, with another sudden change of tone, bending over him and slipping
her hand caressingly into his. "I will do everything to help you. I did not mean to be cross
a moment ago. I was worried about Oliver's talk. I have been silent so long--I must speak.
Don't be angry, dear, but you must keep the farm. I will go myself and see about the mortgage
at the  bank--we cannot--we must not; go on this way-- we will have nothing left."

He patted her arm again in his gentle way--not to calm her fears, he knew so well that she
was wrong, but to quiet the nerves that he thought unstrung.

"But I need this extra money for some improvements  which I--"

"Yes, I know you THINK so, but you don't, Richard,  you don't?" For Heaven's sake, throw the
motor out into the street, and be done with it. It will ruin us all if things go on as they
have done."

The inventor raised his eyes quickly. He had never seen her so disturbed in all their married
life. She had never spoken in this way before.

"Don't excite yourself, Sallie," he said, gravely, and with a certain air of authority in his
manner. "You'll bring on one of your headaches--it will all come right. Come, my dear, let
us go into the house. People are passing, and will wonder."

She followed him back into the drawing-room, his hand still held fast in hers.

"Promise me one thing," she said, stopping at the door and looking up into his eyes, "and I
won't say another word. Please do nothing more about the farm unless you let me know. Let me
think first how I can help. It will all come out right, as you say, but it will be because
we will make it come right, dear." She drew his face down toward her with one hand and kissed
him tenderly on his cheek. Then she bade him good-night and resumed her seat by the window,
to watch for Oliver's return.

Try as she would, she could not banish her fears. The news of Richard's intention to pay off
the loan by selling the farm had sent a shudder through her heart such as she had never before
experienced, for that which she had dreaded had come to pass. Loyal as she had always been
to her husband, and proud as she was of his genius and accomplishments, and sympathetic  as
they were in all else that their lives touched upon, her keen, penetrating mind had long since
divined  the principal fault that lay at the bottom of her husband's genius. She saw that the
weak point in his make-up was not his inventive quality, but his inability  to realize any
practical results from his inventions  when perfected. She saw, too, with equal certainty how
rapidly their already slender means were being daily depleted in costly experiments-- many
of which were abandoned as soon as tried, and she knew full well that the end was but a question
of time. Even when he had abandoned the law, and had exchanged his office near the Court-house
for his shop in the back yard, and had given his library to his young students, she had not
despaired; she still had faith in his genius.

She had first become uneasy when the new steam cut-off had failed to reimburse him. When this
catastrophe  was followed by his losing every dollar of his interest in the improved cotton-gin,
because of his generosity to a brother inventor, her uneasiness had become the keenest anxiety.
And now here was this new motor, in which he seemed more absorbed than in any other of his
inventions. This was to plunge them into still greater difficulties and jeopardize even the farm.

Richard had not been disturbed by it all. Serene and hopeful always, the money question had
counted for nothing with him. His compensation lay in the fact that his theories had been proved
true. More- over, there were, he knew, other inventions ahead, and more important discoveries
to be made. If money were necessary, these new inventions would supply it. Such indifference
to practical questions was an agony to one of her temperament, burdened as she was by the thought
of their increasing daily expenses, the magnitude of which Richard never seemed to appreciate.

And yet until to-night, when Richard had made his announcement about the mortgage, she had
made no protest, uttered no word of censure. Neither had any jar or discord ever disturbed
the sweet harmony of their home-life. And she had only behaved as any other wife in Kennedy
Square would have done in like circumstances. Remonstrances against a husband's  business methods
were never made in the best families. In his own house Richard was master. So she had suffered
on and held her peace, while Richard  walked with his head in the clouds, unconscious of her
doubts. The situation must now be met, and she determined to face it with all her might. "The
farm shall not be sacrificed, if I can help it," she kept repeating to herself; "any economy
is better than that disaster."

When at last the shock of the news of the threatened  disaster had passed, and she had regained
her customary composure, she decided to act at once and at head-quarters, outside of Richard's
help or knowledge.  She would send for Colonel Clayton, one of the directors of the bank, in
the morning, and see what could be done to postpone for a time the bank's action. This would
give her time to think what next could best be done to save the property. This settled  in
her mind, she gave herself up to the more important and pressing need of the moment--the dissuading
of Oliver from this new act of folly.

At the end of an hour she was still sitting by the drawing-room window, straining her eyes
across the Square, noting every figure that passed into the radiance  of the moonlight, her
mind becoming clearer as her indomitable will, which had never failed her in domestic crises,
began to assert itself.

When her eye fell at last upon her son, he was walking with swinging gait up the long path
across the Square, whistling as he came, his straw hat tilted on one side, his short coat flying
free. He had taken Sue home, and the two had sat on her father's steps in the moonlight long
after the other boys and girls had scattered to their homes. The Colonel had come in while
they were talking, and had bade them good- night and gone up to bed.

Girl as she was, Sue already possessed that subtle power of unconscious coquetry which has
distinguished  all the other Sue Claytons of all the other Kennedy Squares the South over since
the days of Pocahontas. She had kept Oliver's mind away from the subject that engrossed him,
and on herself; and when, at last, standing between the big columns of the portico she had
waved her hand, good-night, and had gained his promise to stop in the morning on his way to
the office, for just another word, she felt sure that his every thought was of her. Then she
had closed the big front door--she was the last person  in the house awake--and tripped upstairs,
not lighting her candle until she had peeped through her shutters, and had found him standing
on the other side of the street looking toward the house. He made a handsome picture of a lover,
as he stood in the moonlight, and Sue smiled complacently to herself at the delicate attention
paid her, but Oliver's eyes, the scribe is ashamed to say, were not fixed on the particular
pair of green blinds that concealed this adorable young lady, certainly not with any desire
to break through their privacy. One of the unforgivable sins--nay, one of the impossible sins--about
Kennedy Square would have been to have recognized a lady who looked, even during the daytime,
out from a bedroom window: much less at night. That was why Sue did not open her blinds.

Nor, indeed, was Oliver occupied with the question  of Sue's blinds at all. He had for the
moment in fact completely forgotten the existence of his lady- love. He was, if the truth must
be told, studying the wonderful effect of the white light of the moon flooding with its radiance
the columns and roof of the Clayton house, the dark magnolias silhouetted against the flight
of steps and the indigo-blue of the sky. He had already formulated in his mind the palette
with which he would paint it, and had decided that the magnolias  were blue-black and not green,
and the steps greenish-white. He had, furthermore, determined to make an outline of it in the
daylight, and talk to Mr. Crocker about it. Sue's eyes, which but a moment before  had so charmed
him, no longer lingered in his memory--nor even in any one of the far corners of his head and
heart. It was only when her light flashed up that he awoke to the realization of what he was
doing, and even this breach of good manners was forgotten by him in his delight over the effect
which the red glow of the candle gave to the whole composition.

With the picture clearly stamped upon his brain, he turned and stepped quickly across the Square,
and in another moment he had thrown his mother a kiss through the window, and rushing inside
had caught her in his arms.

"Poor motherkins--and you all alone," he cried. "Why, I thought you and father had gone to
bed long ago."

"No, son--I was waiting for you." He laid his fresh young face against hers, insisting that
she must go to bed at once; helping her upstairs awkwardly, laughing as he went--telling her
she was the sweetest  girl he ever knew and his best sweetheart--kissing  her pale cheeks as
they climbed the steps together to his room.

She had determined, as she sat by the window, to talk to him of what she had overheard him
say to Sue, and of her anxiety over Richard's revelations, but his joyous kiss had robbed her
of the power. She would wait for another time--she said to herself-- not to-night, when he
was so happy.

"Anybody at Sue's, Ollie?" she asked, lighting his candle.

"Only the boys and girls--Tom Pitts, Charley Bowman, Nellie Talbot, and one or two others.
The Colonel came in just before I left."

"But the Colonel will be home to-morrow, will he not?" she asked, quickly, as if something
forgotten  had been suddenly remembered.

"Yes--think so--" answered Oliver, taking off his coat and hanging it over the chair--"because
he was just up from Pongateague. He and Major Pitts got thirty-seven woodcock in two days.
Tom wants me to go down with him some day next week. "

A shade of anxiety crossed the mother's face.

"What did you tell him, son?" She moved a chair nearer the bureau and sat down to watch him
undress, as she had always done since the day she first tucked him into his crib.

"Oh, I said I would ask you." He was loosening his cravat, his chin thrown up, the light of
the candle  falling over his well-knit shoulders and chest outlined through his white shirt.

"Better not go, Ollie--you've been away so much lately."

"Oh, dearie," he protested, in a tone as a child would have done, "what does a day or two matter?
Be a darling old mother and let me go. Tom has a gun for me, and Mr. Talbot is going to lend
us his red setter. Tom's sister is going, too, and so are her cousins. Just think, now, I haven't
had a day in the country for a coon's age." His arms were round her neck now. He seemed happier
over the excuse to caress her than anxious about her possible refusal.

She loosened one of his hands and laid it on her cheek. 

"No holidays, son? Why you had two last week, when you all went out to Stemmer's Run," she
said, looking up into his face, his hand still in hers.

"Yes, but that was fishing!" he laughed as he waved an imaginary rod in his hands.

"And the week before, when you spent the day at Uncle Tilghman's?" she continued, smiling sadly
at him, but with the light of an ill-concealed admiration  on her face.

"Ah, but mother, I went to see the Lely! That's an education. Oh, that portrait in pink!" He
was serious now, looking straight down into her eyes-- talking with his hands, one thumb in
air as if it were a bit of charcoal and he was outlining the Lely on an equally real canvas.
"Such color, mother-- such an exquisite poise of the head and sweep to the shoulder--" and
the thumb described a curve in the air as if following every turn of Lely's brush.

Her eyes followed his gestures--she loved his enthusiasm,  although she wished it had been
about something else.

"And you don't get any education out of the Judge's law-books?"

"No, I wish I did." The joyous look on his face was gone now--his hand had fallen to his side.
"It gets to be more of a muddle every day--" and then he added, with the illogical reasoning
of youth--"all the lawyers that ever lived couldn't paint a picture like the Lely."

Mrs. Horn closed her eyes. It was on her tongue to tell him she knew what was in his heart,
but she stopped; no, not to-night, she said firmly to herself, and shut her lips tight--a way
she had of bracing her nerves in such emergencies.

Oliver in turn saw the expression of anxiety that crossed his mother's face and the thin drawn
line of the lips. One word from her and he would have poured out his heart. Then some shadow
that crossed her face silenced him. "No, not to-night--" he said to himself. "She has been
sitting up for me and is tired--I'll tell her to-morrow."

"Don't go with Tom Pitts, my son," she said, calmly. "I'd rather you'd stay; I don't want you
to go this time. Perhaps a little later--" and a slight shiver went through her as she rose
from her chair and moved toward him.

He made no protest. Her final word was always law to him--not because she dominated him, but
because  his nature was always to be in harmony with the thing he loved. Because, too, underneath
it all was that quality of tenderness to all women old and young, which forbade him to cause
one of them pain. Almost unconsciously to himself he had gone through a process by which from
having yielded her the obedience  of a child, he now surrendered to her the pleasures of his
youth when the old feeling of maternal  dominance still controlled her in her attitude to him.
She did not recognize the difference, and he had but half-perceived it, but the difference
had already transformed him from a boy into a man, though with unrecognized powers of stability
as yet. In obeying his mother, then at twenty-two, or even in meeting the whims and conceits
of his sweethearts, this quality of tenderness to the woman was always uppermost in his heart.
The surrender of a moment's  pleasure seemed so little to him compared to the expression of
pain he could see cross their faces. He had so much to make him happy--what mattered it if
out of a life so full he should give up any one thing to please his mother.

Patting him on the cheek and kissing him on the neck, as she had so often done when some sudden
wave of affection overwhelmed her, she bade him good-night at last.

Once outside in the old-fashioned hall, she stopped for a moment, her eyes fixed on the floor,
the light from the hall-lamp shining on her silver hair and the shawl about her shoulders,
and said slowly to herself, as if counting each word:

"What--can I do--to save this boy--from--himself?"

CHAPTER V

A MESSAGE OF IMPORTANCE

Richard, when he waked, made no allusion to the mortgage nor to his promise the night before,
to take no steps in the matter without her consent, nor could Mrs. Horn see that the inventor
had given the subject  further thought. He came in to breakfast with his usual serenity of
mien, kissed her gallantly on the cheek--in all their married life this dear old gentleman
had never forgotten this breakfast kiss-- and taking his seat opposite her, he picked up the
new Scientific Review, just in by the morning mail, and began cutting the leaves. She tried
to draw him into conversation by asking him when the note on the mortgage was due, but his
mind was doubtless absorbed by some problem suggested by the Review before him, for without
answering--he, of course, had not heard her--he rose from his chair, excused himself for a
moment, opened a book in his library, studied it leisurely, and only resumed his seat when
Malachi gently touched his elbow and said:

"Coffee purty nigh done sp'ilt, Marse Richard."

Breakfast over, Richard picked up his letters, and with that far-away look in his eyes which
his wife knew so well, walked to the closet, took down his long red calico gown, slipped it
over his coat, and with a loving pat on his wife's shoulder as he passed, and with the request
that no one but Nathan should see him that morning, made his way through the damp brick-paved
back yard to the green door of his "li'l" room.

Mrs. Horn watched his retreating figure from the window--his head bent, his soft hair stirred
by the morning air, falling about his shoulders. His serenity;  his air of abstraction; of
being wrapped in the clouds as it were--borne aloft by the power of a thought altogether beyond
her, baffled her as it always did. She could not follow his flights when he was in one of these
uplifted moods. She could only watch and wait until he returned again to the common ground
of their daily love and companionship.

Brushing a quick tear from her eyes with an impatient  sigh, she directed Malachi to go to
Oliver's room and tell him he must get up at once, as she wanted him to carry a message of
importance. She had herself rapped at her son's door as she passed on her way downstairs, and
Malachi had already paid two visits to the same portal--one with Oliver's shoes and one on
his own account. He had seen his mistress's  anxiety, and knowing that his young master had
come in late the night before, had mistaken the cause, charging Mrs. Horn's perturbation to
Oliver's account. The only response Oliver had made to either of his warnings had been a smothered
yawn and a protest at being called at daylight. On his third visit Malachi was more insistent,
the hall-clock by that time having struck nine.

"Ain't you out'en dat bed yit, Marse Oliver? Dis yere's de third time I been yere. Better git
up; yo' ma's gittin' onres'less."

"Coming, Mally. Tell mother I'll be down right away," called Oliver, springing out of bed.
Malachi  stepped softly downstairs again, bowed low to his mistress, and with a perfectly straight
face said:

"He's mos' ready, mistis. Jes' a-breshin' ob his ha'r when I opened de do'. Spec' Marse Oliver
overslep'  hisse'f, or maybe nobody ain't call him--"

He could not bear to hear the boy scolded. He had begun to shield his young master in the days
when he carried him on his shoulder, and he would still shade the truth for him whenever he
considered necessity required it.

When Oliver at last came downstairs it was by means of the hand-rail as a slide, a dash through
the hall and a bound into the breakfast-room, followed by a joyous good-morning, meeting his
mother's "How could you be so late, my boy," without any defence of his conduct, putting one
hand under her chin and the other around her neck, and kissing her where her white hair parted
over her forehead.

Malachi waited an instant, breathing freer when he found that his statement regarding Oliver's
toilet had passed muster, and then shuffled off to the kitchen for hot waffles and certain
other comforting viands that Aunt Hannah, the cook, had kept hot for her young master, Malachi's
several reports having confirmed  her suspicions that Oliver, as usual, would be half an hour late.

"What a morning, motherkins," Oliver cried. "Such a sky, all china-blue and white. Oh, you
just ought to see how fine the old church looms up behind  the trees. I'm going to paint that
some day, from my window. Dad had his breakfast?" and he glanced at the empty seat and plate.
"Sausage, eh? Mally, got any for me?" and he dragged up his chair beside her, talking all the
time as he spread his napkin and drew the dishes toward him.

He never once noticed her anxious face, he was so full of his own buoyant happiness. She did
not check his enthusiasm. This breakfast-hour alone with her boy--he was almost always later
than Richard --was the happiest of the day. But her heart was too heavy this morning to enjoy
it. Instead of listening with her smile of quiet satisfaction, answering  him now and then
with a gayety of humor which matched his own, she was conscious only of the waiting  for an
opportunity to break into his talk with out jarring upon his mood. At last, with a hesitating
emphasis that would have alarmed anyone less wrapped in his own content than her son, she said:

"Ollie, when you finish your breakfast I want you, on your way to Judge Ellicott's office,
to stop at Colonel Clayton's and ask him to be good enough to come and see me as soon as he
can on a little matter of business. Tell him I will keep him but a minute. If you hurry, my
son, you'll catch him before  he leaves the house."

The die was cast now. She had taken her first step without Richard's hand to guide her--the
first in all her life. It was pain to do it--the more exquisite because she loved to turn to
him for guidance or relief, to feel the sense of his protection. Heretofore he had helped her
in every domestic emergency, his soft, gentle hand soothing and quieting her, when troubles
arose. She had wavered during the night between her duty to her family in saving the farm,
and her duty to her husband  in preserving unbroken the tie of loyal dependence  that had always
bound them together. Many emotions had shaken her as she lay awake, her eyes fixed on the flutings
in the canopy of the high-post bedstead which the night-lamp faintly illumined, Richard asleep
beside her, dreaming doubtless of cogs and pulleys and for the hundredth time of his finding
the one connecting link needed to complete the chain of his success.

But before the day had broken, her keen, penetrating  mind had cut through the fog of her doubts.
Come what may, the farm should never be given up. Richard, for all his urgent need of money
to perfect  his new motor, should not be allowed to sacrifice this the only piece of landed
property which they possessed, except the roof that sheltered them all. The farm saved, she
would give her attention to Oliver's future career. On one point her mind was firmly made up--he
should never, in spite of what his father said, become a painter.

Oliver hurried through his breakfast, cut short Malachi's second relay of waffles to the great
disappointment of that excellent servitor, and with his mother's message for the moment firmly
fixed in his mind, tilted his hat on one side of his head and started across Kennedy Square,
whistling as he went.

Mrs. Horn moved her seat to the window and looked out upon the brick-paved yard. The door of
the shop was shut. Richard was already at work, for a thin curl of blue smoke was rising from
the chimney.  As she sat looking out upon the tulip-tree and the ivy-covered wall beyond, a
strange, unaccountable sense of loneliness new in her experience came over her. The lines about
her mouth settled more firmly, and the anxious look that had filled her eyes changed to one
of determination.

"Nobody can help," she said to herself with a sigh. "I must do it all myself;" and picking
up her basket of keys she mounted slowly to her room.

Once outside the front door, with the fresh, clear air stirring to a silver-white the leaves
of the maples, the birds singing in the branches and the sky glistening  overhead, one of those
sudden changes of mood to which our young hero was subject swept over him. The picture of the
dear mother whom he loved and whose anxious face had at last filled his thoughts, by some shifting
of the gray matter of this volatile young gentleman's brain had suddenly become replaced  by
another.

Pretty Sue Clayton, her black eyes snapping with fun, her hand so soon to be outstretched in
welcome, was now the dominating figure in his mental horizon. Even Sir Peter Lely's girl in
pink and the woodcock shooting with Tom Pitts, and all the other delights that had filled his
brain had become things of the past as he thought of Sue's greeting. For the time being this
black-eyed little witch with the ringlets about her face had complete possession of him.

He had not thought of her, it is true, for five consecutive  minutes since he had bidden her
good-night ten hours ago; and he would, I am quite sure, have forgotten even his promise to
see her this morning had not his mother's message made his going to her house imperative. And
yet, now that the prospect of having a glimpse of her face was assured, he could hardly wait
until he reached her side.

Not that he had some new thing to tell her-- something that had bubbled up fresh from the depths
of his heart over-night. Indeed, had that portion of this young gentleman's anatomy been searched
with a dark lantern, it can safely be said that not the slightest suggestion of this fair inamorata's
form or lineaments would have been found lurking in any one of its recesses. Furthermore, I
can state positively --and I knew this young gentleman quite well at the time--that it was
not Sue at all that he longed for at this precise moment, even though he hurried to meet her.
It was more the WOMAN IN HER--the something that satisfied his inner nature when he was with
her--her coy touches of confidence, her artless  outbursts of admiration, looking up in his
face as she spoke, the dimples playing about the corners of her mouth. He revelled in all those
subtle flatteries  and cajoleries, and in all the arts to please of which she was past mistress.
He loved to believe her--she intended that he should--when she told him how different he was
from anybody about Kennedy Square, and how nobody swam or rode or danced as he did; nor wore
their hair so becomingly, nor their clothes--especially the gray jacket buttoned up close under
the chin, not carried themselves as they walked; nor--

Why go on? We all know exactly how she said it, and how sincere she seemed, and how we believed
it all (and do now, some of us), and how blissful it was to sit beside her and hear her voice
and know that this most adorable of women really believed that the very sun itself rose and
set in our own adorable persons.

Because of all this and of many other things with which we have nothing to do, our young hero
saw only Sue's eyes when that maiden, who had been watching for him at the library window,
laid her hand on the lapel of his coat in her coaxing way. No wonder he had forgotten everything
which his mother had asked him to do. I can forgive him under the circumstances--and so can
you. Soft hands are very beguiling, sometimes--and half-closed lids--Well! It is a good many
years ago, but there are some things that none of us ever forget.

Blinded by such fascinations it is not at all astonishing  that long before Oliver regained
his senses the Colonel had left the house for the day. That distinguished  gentleman would,
no doubt, have waited the young prince's pleasure in his library had he known of his errand.
But since the Colonel had  unfortunately taken himself off, there was nothing, of course, for
our Oliver to do but to remain where he was until noon--this was Sue's way out of the difficulty
--and then to catch the Colonel at the bank where he could always be found between twelve and
one o'clock, or where Mr. Stiger, the cashier, could lay his hands on him if he was anywhere
in the neighborhood,  a suggestion of Sue's which at once relieved Oliver from further anxiety,
Mr. Stiger being one of his oldest and dearest friends.

By the time, however, that Oliver had reached the bank the Colonel had left for the club, where
he would have been too happy, no doubt--being the most courteous of colonels, etc., etc.--"if
his dear young friend had only sent him word," etc.

All this our breathless young Mercury--Oliver never walked when he could run--learned some
hours later from old Mr. Stiger, the cashier, who punched him in the ribs at the end of every
sentence in which he conveyed the disappointing information, calling him "Creeps," at short
intervals, and roaring with laughter at the boy's account of the causes leading up to his missing
the Colonel.

"Gone to the club, Creeps, don't I tell you (--punch in the ribs--); gone to get a little sip
of Madeira and a little bit of woodcock (--punch over the heart--), and a little--oh, I tell
you, you young dog--" (this punch straight on the breast-bone)-- "you ought to be a bank director--you
hear!--a big fat bank director, and own a big house up in the Square, if you want to enjoy
yourself--and have a pretty daughter--Oh, you young rascal!" This last punch bent Oliver double,
and was followed by an outburst of uncontrollable laughter from Stiger.

These same punchings and outbursts had gone on since the days that Oliver was in short trousers
and Stiger was superintendent of the Sunday-school which the boy had attended in his early
years--Stiger was still superintendent and of the same school: cashiers had to have certificates
of character in those days. A smooth-shaven, round-headed old fellow was Stiger, with two little
dabs of side-whiskers, a pair of eyes that twinkled behind a pair of gold spectacles, and a
bald head kept polished by the constant mopping  of a red silk handkerchief. His costume in
the bank was a black alpaca coat and high black satin stock, which grabbed him tight around
the neck, and held in place the two points of his white collar struggling  to be free. Across
his waist-line was a square of cloth. This, in summer, replaced his waistcoat, and, in winter,
protected it from being rubbed into holes by constant contact with the edge of the counter.

His intimacy with Oliver dated from one hot Sunday  morning years before, when Oliver had broken
in upon the old gentleman's long prayers by sundry scrapings of his finger-nails down the whitewashed
wall of the school-room, producing a blood-cooling and most irreverent sound, much to the discomfort
of the worshippers.

"Who made that noise?" asked Mr. Stiger, when the amen was reached.

"Me, sir."

"What for?"

"To get cool. It makes creeps go down my back." From that day the old cashier had never called
Oliver anything but "Creeps."

Oliver, in a spirit of playful revenge, made caricatures  of his prosecutor in these later
years, enlarging  his nose, puffing out his cheeks, and dressing him up in impossible clothes.
These sketches he would mail to the cashier as anonymous communications, always stopping at
the bank the next day to see how Stiger enjoyed them. He generally found them tacked up over
the cashier's desk. Some of them were still there when Stiger died.

Carried away by the warm greetings of the old cashier, and the hearty, whole-souled spirit
of  companionship inherent in the man--a spirit always dear to Oliver--he not only stayed to
make another caricature  of the old fellow, over which the original laughed until the tears
ran down his fat cheeks, but until all the old sketches were once more taken from the drawer
or examined on the wall and laughed at over again, Stiger praising him for his cleverness and
predicting all kinds of honors and distinctions for him when his talents become recognized.
It was just the atmosphere of general approval in which our young hero loved to bask, and again
the hours slipped away and three o'clock came and went and his mother's message was still undelivered.
Nor had he been at Judge Ellicott's office. This fact was not impressed upon him by the moon-faced
clock that hung over the cashier's desk--time made no difference  to Oliver--but by the cashier
himself, who began  stuffing the big books into a great safe built into the wall, preparatory
to locking it with a key that could have opened the gate of a walled town, and which the old
gentleman took home with him every night and hung on a nail by his bed.

Thus it came to pass that another half hour had struck before Oliver mounted the steps of the
Chesapeake  Club in search of the elusive Colonel.

The fat, mahogany-colored porter, who sat all day in the doorway of the club, dozing in his
lobster- shell bath-chair, answered his next inquiry. This ancient relic; who always boasted
that no gentleman member of the club, dead or alive, could pass him without being recognized,
listened to Oliver's request with a certain lifeless air--a manner always shown to strangers--and
shuffled away to the reading-room to find the Colonel.

The occupant of this bath-chair was not only one of the characters of the club but one of the
characters of the town. He was a squat, broken-kneed old darky, with white eyebrows arching
over big brass spectacles, a flat nose, and two keen, restless monkey eyes. His hands, like
those of many negroes of his age, were long and shrivelled, the palms wrinkled as the inside,
of a turkey's foot and of the same color and texture. His two feet, always in evidence, rested
on their heels, and were generally encased in carpet slippers--shoes being out of the question
owing to his life-long habit of storing inside his own person the drainings of the decanters,
an idiosyncrasy which produced a form of gout that only carpet slippers could alleviate. In
his earlier life he had carried General  Washington around in his arms, had waited on Henry
Clay, and had been body-servant to Lafayette, besides holding the horses of half the generals
of the War of 1812--at, least, he said so, and no man of his color dared contradict him.

The years of service of this guardian of the front door dated back to the time when the Chippendale
furniture of Colonel Ralph Coston, together with many of the portraits covering the walls,
and the silver chafing-dishes lining the sideboard, had come into the possession of the club
through that gentleman's last will and testament. Coston was the most beloved of all the epicures
of his time, and his famous terrapin- stew--one of the marvellous, delicacies of the period
--had been cooked in these same chafing-dishes. The mahogany-colored Cerberus had been Coston's
slave as well as butler, and still belonged to the estate. It was eminently proper, therefore,
that he should still maintain his position at the club as long as his feet held out.

While he was gone in search of the Colonel, Oliver occupied himself for a moment in examining
one of the old English sporting prints that ornamented the side-walls of the bare, uncarpeted,
dismal hall. It was the second time that he had entered these sacred doors --few men of his
own age had ever done as much. He had stopped there once before in search of his father, when
his mother had been taken suddenly ill. He recalled again the curious spiral staircase at the
end of the hall where his father had met him and which had impressed him so at the time. He
could see, too, the open closet out of which Mr. Horn had taken his overcoat, and which was
now half-filled with hats and coats.

From the desolate, uninviting hall, Oliver passed into the large meeting-room of the club fronting
the street, now filled with members, many of whom had dropped in for half an hour on their
way back to their offices. Of these some of the older and more sedate men, like Judge Bowman
and Mr. Pancoast, were playing chess; others were seated about the small tables, reading, sipping
toddies, or chatting  together. A few of the younger bloods, men of forty or thereabouts, were
standing by the uncurtained windows watching the belles of the town in their flounced dresses
and wide leghorn hats, out for an afternoon visit or promenade. Among these men Oliver recognized
Howard Thom, son of the Chief- Justice, poor as a church mouse and fifty years of age if a
day. Oliver was not surprised to find Thom craning his neck at the window. He remembered the
story they told of this perennial beau--of how he had been in love with every woman in and
around Kennedy Square, from Miss Clendenning down to the latest debutante, and of how he would
tell you over his first toddy that he had sown his wild oats and was about to settle down for
life, and over his last--the sixth, or seventh, or eighth--that the most adorable woman in
town, after a life devoted to her service, had thrown him over, and that henceforth all that
was left to him was a load of buckshot and six feet of earth.

Oliver bowed to those of the members he knew, and wheeling one of the clumsy mahogany chairs
into position, sat down to await the arrival of Colonel Clayton.

Meanwhile his eyes wandered over the desolate room with its leather-covered chairs and sofas
and big marble mantel bare of every ornament but another  moon-faced clock--a duplicate of
the one at the bank--and two bronze candelabra flanking each end, and then on the portraits
of the dead and gone members which relieved the sombre walls--one in a plum-colored coat with
hair tied in a queue being no other than his own ancestor. He wondered to himself where lay
the charm and power to attract in a place so colorless, and he thought, as was his habit with
all interiors, how different he would want it to be if he ever became a member. His fresh young
nature revolted at the dinginess and bareness of the surroundings. He couldn't understand why
the men came here and what could be the fascination of sitting  round these cold tables talking
by the hour when there was so much happiness outside--so much of light and air and sunshine
free to everybody.

He was, moreover, a little constrained and uncomfortable. There was none of the welcome of
Mr. Crocker's studio about this place, nor any of the comforting companionship of the jolly
old cashier, who made the minutes fly as if they had wings; and that, too, in a musty bank
far more uninviting even than the club. He remembered his mother's message now--and he remembered
her face and the anxious expression--as we always remember duties when we are uncomfortable.
He meant to hurry home to her as soon as the Colonel dismissed him, and tell her how it had
all happened, and how sorry he was, and what a stupid he had been, and she would forgive him
as she had a hundred times before.

As he sat absorbed in these thoughts his attention was attracted by a conversation at the adjoining
table between that dare-devil cross-country rider, Tom Gunning of Calvert County, old General
McTavish of the Mexican War, and Billy Talbot the exquisite. Gunning was in his corduroys and
hunting-boots. He always wore them when he came to town, even when dining with his friends.
He had them on now, the boots being specially in evidence, one being hooked over the chair
on which he sat and within  a foot of Oliver's elbow. None of these peculiarities,  however,
made the slightest difference in Kennedy  Square, so far as Gunning's social position was concerned--Tom's
mother having been a Carroll and his grandfather once Governor of the State.

The distinguished cross-country rider was telling General McTavish, immaculate in black wig,
blue coat, pepper-and-salt trousers and patent-leather shoes, and red-faced Billy Talbot, of
an adventure that he, Gunning, had had the night before while driving  home to his plantation.
The exquisite's costume was in marked contrast to those of the other two--it was his second
change that day. At this precise moment  he was upholstered in peg-top, checker-board trousers,
bob-tail Piccadilly coat, and a one-inch brim straw hat, all of the latest English pattern.
Everything,  in fact, that Billy possessed was English, from a rimless monocle decorating his
left eye, down to the animated door-mat of a skye-terrier that followed at his heels.

Oliver saw from the way in which McTavish leaned over the table, protecting the tray with his
two arms, that he was in command of the decanter, and that the duty of alleviating the thirst
of his  companions had devolved upon the General. Billy Talbot  sat with his hat tipped back
on his head, his chin resting on his abbreviated cane, his eyes fixed on Gunning. Both McTavish
and Talbot were listening  intently to the cross-country rider's story.

"And you say you were sober, Gunning?" Oliver heard the General ask, with a scrutinizing look
at Tom. Not with any humorous intent--more with the manner of a presiding officer at a court-martial,
determined to establish certain essential facts.

"As a clock, General. The first thing I knew the mare shied and I came pretty near landin'
in the dirt." (The lower county men always dropped their g's.) "He was lyin', I tell you, right
across the road. If it hadn't been for Kitty, I would have run him down. I got out and held
onto the reins, and there he was, sir, stretched out as drunk as a lord, flat on his back and
sound asleep. I saw right away that he was a gentleman,  and I tied the mare to a tree, picked
him up with the greatest care, laid him on the side of the road, put his hat under his head,
and made him as comfortable as I could, when, by George, sir! I hadn't any more than got back
to my buggy, when bang! went a ball within a foot of my head!"

The General, who, as he listened, had been repointing  the waxed ends of his dyed mustache
with his lemon-colored kid gloves, now leaned back in his chair.

"Fired at you, sir?" The General had served both at Chapultepec and Buena Vista, and was an
authority  where gunpowder was concerned.

"That's just what he did. Came near takin' the top of my head off! Hadn't been so dark he would
have done it."

"Good God! you don't tell me so!" exclaimed the General, mopping his lips with his perfumed
handkerchief.  "Were you armed, Gunning?"

"No, sir, I was entirely at his mercy and absolutely  defenceless. Well, I grabbed the reins
to quiet the mare and then I hollered out--'What the devil do you mean, sir, by tryin' to blow
the top of my head off?' I could see now that he had raised himself  up on his elbow and was
lookin' at me in a way I did not like.

"'What do you mean by disturbin' my rest, sir,' he called back.

"'Well, but my dear sir, you were lyin' in the middle of the road and might have been run over.'

"'It's none of your business where I lie,' he hollered  back. 'I go to sleep where I damn please,
sir. I consider it a very great liberty.'

"'I, beg your pardon, sir,' I said. 'I did not intend  any trespass--' I was walkin' toward
him now. I did not want him to shoot again.

"'That's sufficient, sir,' he said. 'No gentleman can do more. There's my hand, sir. Allow
me, sir, to offer you a drink. If you will roll me over, you will find my flask in my coat-tail
pocket.'

"Well, I rolled him over, took a drink, and then I brought the mare alongside, helped him in
and drove him home to my house. He was a most delightful  gentleman. Didn't leave my place
until four o'clock in the mornin'. He lives about fifteen miles below me. He told me his name
was Toffington. Do you happen to know him, Talbot?" said Gunning, turning to Billy.

"Toffington, Toffington," said Billy, dropping his eye-glasses with a movement of his eyebrows.
He had listened to the story without the slightest comment.  "No, Tom, unless he is one of
those upper county men. There was a fellow I met in London last year--" (Billy pronounced it
"larst yarh," to Oliver's infinite amusement) "with some such name as that. He and I went over
to Kew Gardens with the Duke of--."

Gunning instantly turned around with an impatient  gesture--nobody ever listened to one of
Billy's London stories, they being the never-ending jokes around Kennedy Square--faced the
General again, much to Oliver's regret, who would have loved above all things to hear Billy
descant on his English experiences.

"Do you, General, know anybody named Toffington?"  asked Tom.

"No, Gunning--but here comes Clayton, he knows everybody in the State that is worth knowing.
What you have told me is most extraordinary--most extraordinary,  Gunning. It only goes to
show how necessary  it is for every man to be prepared for emergencies  of this kind. You should
never go unarmed, sir. You had a very narrow escape--a very narrow escape, Gunning. Here, Clayton--come
over here."

Oliver pulled his face into long lines. The picture of Gunning taking a drink with a man who
a moment before had tried to blow the top of his head off, and the serious way in which the
coterie about the table regarded the incident, so excited the boy's risibles that he would
have laughed outright had not his eye rested on the Colonel walking toward him.

The Colonel, evidently, did not hear McTavish's call. His mind was occupied with something
much more important. He had been finishing a game of whist upstairs, and the mahogany-colored
Cerberus had not dared to disturb him until the hand was played out. The fact that young Oliver
Horn had called to see him at such an hour and in such a place had greatly disturbed him. He
felt sure that something  out of the ordinary had happened.

"My dear boy," he cried, as Oliver rose to meet him, "I have this instant heard you were here,
or I never should have kept you waiting a moment. Nothing serious--nothing at home?"

"Oh, no, Colonel. Only a word from mother, sir. I missed you at the bank and Mr. Stiger thought
that I might better come here," and he delivered his mother's message in a low voice and resumed
his seat again.

The Colonel, now that his mind was at rest, dropped into a chair, stroked his goatee with his
thumb and forefinger, and ran over in his mind the sum of his engagements.

"Tell your dear mother," he said, "that I will do myself the honor of calling upon her on my
way home late this afternoon. Nothing will give me greater pleasure. Now stay awhile with me
and let me order something for you, my boy," and he beckoned  to one of the brown-coated servants
who had entered the room with a fresh tray for the Gunning table.

"No, thank you, Colonel; I ought not to stop," Oliver replied, in an apologetic way, as he
rose from his seat. "I really ought to go back and tell mother," and with a grasp of Clayton's
hand and a bow to one or two men in the room who were watching his movements --the Colonel
following him to the outer door --Oliver took himself off, as was the duty of one so young
and so entirely out of place among a collection  of men all so knowing and distinguished.

CHAPTER VI

AMOS COBB'S ADVICE

In full justice to the Chesapeake Club the scribe must admit that such light-weights as Billy
Talbot, Torn Gunning, and Carter Thorn did not fairly represent  the standing of the organization.
Many of the most cultivated and enlightened men about Kennedy  Square and the neighboring country
enjoyed its privileges; among them not only such men as Richard Horn, Nathan Gill, the Chief-Justice
of the State, and those members of the State Legislature  whose birth was above reproach, but
most of the sporting gentry of the county, as well as many of the more wealthy planters who
lived on the Bay and whose houses were opened to their fellow-members  when the ducks were flying.

Each man's lineage, occupation, and opinions on the leading topics of the time were as well
known to the club as to the man himself. Any new-corner presenting  himself for membership
was always subjected to the severest scrutiny, and had to be favorably passed upon by a large
majority of the committee before  a sufficient number of votes could be secured for his election.

The only outsider elected for years had been Amos Cobb, of Vermont, the abolitionist, as he
was generally called, who invariably wore black broad- cloth and whose clean-shaven face--a
marked contrast to the others--with its restless black eyes, strong nose, and firm mouth, was
as sharp and hard as the rocks of his native State. His election to full membership of the
Chesapeake Club was not due to his wealth and commercial standing--neither of these would have
availed him--but to the fact that he had married a daughter of Judge Wharton of Wharton Hall,
and had thus, by reason of his alliance  with one of the first families of the State, been
admitted to all the social privileges of Kennedy Square. This exception in his favor, however,
had never crippled Cobb's independence nor stifled his fearlessness in expressing his views
on any one of the leading topics of the day. The Vermonter had worked with his hands when a
boy on his father's farm, and believed in the dignity of labor and the blessings of self-support.
He believed, too, in the freedom of all men, black and white, and looked upon slavery as a
crime. He expressed these sentiments openly and unreservedly, and declared that no matter how
long he might live South he would never cease to raise his voice against a system which allowed
a man--as he put it--"to sit down in the shade and fan himself to sleep while a lot of niggers
whose bodies he owned were sweating in a corn-field to help feed and clothe him."

These sentiments, it must be said, did not add to his popularity, although the time had not
yet arrived when he would have been thrown into the street for uttering them.

Nathan Gill was a daily visitor. He was just mounting the club steps, his long pen-wiper cloak
about his shoulders, as Oliver, after his interview with Colonel Clayton, passed down the street
on his way back to his mother. Nathan shook hands with the Colonel, and the two entered the
main room, and seated themselves at one of the tables.

Billy Talbot, who had moved to the window, and who had been watching Oliver until he disappeared
around the corner, dropped his eye-glass with that peculiar twitch of the upper lip which no
one could have imitated, and crossed the room to where Nathan  and Colonel Clayton had taken
their seats. Waggles, the scrap of a Skye terrier, who was never three feet from Billy's heels,
instantly crossed with him. After Billy had anchored himself and had assumed  his customary
position, with his feet slightly apart, Waggles, as was his habit, slid in and sat down on
his haunches between his master's gaiters. There he lifted his fluffy head and gazed about
him. The skill with which Mr. Talbot managed his dog was only equalled by the dexterity with
which he managed his eye-glass; he never inadvertently stepped on the one nor unconsciously
let slip the other. This caused Mr. Talbot considerable mental strain, but as it was all to
which he ever subjected himself he stood the test bravely.

"Who is that young man, Colonel" Billy began, as he bent his head to be sure that Waggles was
in position. He had been abroad while Oliver was growing up, and so did not recognize him.

"That's Richard Horn's son," the Colonel said, without raising his eyes from the paper. The
Colonel  never took Billy seriously.

"And a fine young fellow he is," broke in Nathan,  straightening himself proudly.

"Hope he don't take after his father, Gill. By the way, what's that old wisionary doing now?"
drawled Billy, throwing back the lapels of his coat, and slapping his checked trousers with
his cane. "Larst time you talked to me about him he had some machine with w'eels and horse-shoe
magnets, didn't he? He hasn't been in here for some time, so I know he's at work on some tomfoolery
or other. Amazing,  isn't it, that a man of his blood, with a cellar of the best Madeiwa in
the State, should waste his time on such things. Egad! I cawn't understand it." Some of Billy's
expressions, as well as his accent, came in with his clothes. "Now, if I had that Madeiwa,
do you know what I'd do with it? I'd--"

"Perfectly, Billy," cried a man at the next table, who was bending over a game of chess. "You'd
drink it up in a week." Talbot had never been known by any other name than Billy, and never
would be as long as he lived.

When the laugh had subsided, Nathan, whose cheeks were still burning at the slighting way in
which Billy Talbot had spoken of Richard, and who had sat hunched up in his chair combing the
white hair farther over his ears with his long, spare fingers, a habit with him when he was
in deep thought, lifted his head and remarked, quietly, addressing the room rather than Talbot:

"Richard's mind is not on his cellar; he's got something to think of besides Madeira and cards
and dogs." And he looked toward Waggles. "You will all, one day, be proud to say that he lived
in our town. Richard is a genius, one of the most remarkable  men of the day, and everybody
outside of this place knows it; you will be compelled to admit it yet. I left him only half
an hour ago, and he is just perfecting  a motor, gentlemen, which will--"

"Does it go yet, Nathan?" interrupted Cobb, who was filling a glass from a decanter which a
brown- coated darky had brought him. Cobb's wife was Nathan's cousin, and, therefore, he had
a right to be familiar. "I went to see his machine the other day, but I couldn't make anything
out of it. Horn is a little touched here, isn't he?" and he tapped his forehead and smiled
knowingly.

"No, Amos, the motor was not running when I left the shop," answered Nathan, dryly and with
some dignity, "but it will be, he assured me, perhaps by to-morrow." He could fight Billy Talbot,
but he never crossed swords with Cobb, never in late years. Cobb was the one man in all the
world, he once told Richard, with whom he had nothing in common.

"Oh, to-morrow?" And Cobb whistled as he put down the decanter and picked up the day's paper.
It was one of Cobb's jokes--this "to-morrow" of his neighbors. "What was a Northern man's to-
day was always a Southern man's to-morrow," he would say. "I hope this young man of whom you
speak so highly is not walking in the footsteps of this genius of a father? He looks to me
like a young fellow that had some stuff in him if anybody would bring it out."

The half-concealed sneer in Cobb's voice grated also on old Judge Bowman, who threw down his
book and looked up over his bowed spectacles. He was a testy old fellow, with a Burgundy face
and shaggy white hair, a chin and nose that met together like a parrot's,  and an eye like
a hawk. It was one of his principles  to permit none of his intimates to speak ill of his friends
in his hearing. Criticisms, therefore, by an outsider like Cobb were especially obnoxious to him.

"Richard Horn's head is all right, Mr. Cobb, and so is his heart," he exclaimed in an indignant
tone. "As for his genius, sir--Gill is within the mark. He IS one of the remarkable men of
our day. You are quite right, too, about his young son, who has just left here. He has all
the qualities that go to make a gentleman, and many of those which will make a jurist. He is
now studying law with my associate,  Judge Ellicott--a profession ennobled by his ancestors,
sir, and one, for which what you call his 'stuff,' but which we, sir, call his 'blood,' especially
fits him. You Northern men, I know, don't believe in blood. We do down here. This young man
comes of a line of ancestors that have reflected great credit on our State for more than a
hundred years, and he is bound to make his mark. His grandfather on his mother's side was our
Chief Justice in 1810, and his great-grandfather was--"

"That's just what's the matter with most of you Southerners, Judge," interrupted Cobb, his
black eyes snapping. "You think more of blood than you do of brains. We rate a man on Northern
soil by what he does himself, not what a bundle of bones in some family burying-ground did
for him before he was born. Don't you agree with me, Clayton?"

"I can't say I do, Cobb," replied the Colonel, slowly, stirring his toddy. "I never set foot
on your soil but once, and so am unfamiliar with your ways." He never liked Cobb. "He's so
cursedly practical, and so proud of it, too," he would often say; "and if you will pardon me,
sir--a trifle underbred."

"When was that?" asked Cobb, looking over the top of his paper.

"That was some years ago, when I chased a wounded canvas-back across the Susquehanna River,
and had to go ashore to get him; and I want to tell you, sir, that what you call 'your soil'
was damned disagreeable muck. I had to change my boots when I got back to my home, and I've
never worn them since." And the Colonel crushed the sugar in his glass with his spoon as savagely
as if each lump were the head of an enemy, and raised the mixture to his mouth.

Amos's thin lips curled. The high and lofty airs of these patricians always exasperated him.
The shout of laughter that followed the Colonel's reply brought the color to his cheeks.

"Chased him like a runaway nigger, I suppose, Clayton, didn't you? and wrung his neck when
you got him--" retorted Amos, biting his lips.

"Of course, like I would any other piece of my property that tried to get away, or as I would
wring the neck of any man who would help him--" And the Colonel looked meaningly at the Vermonter
and drained his glass with a gulp. Then smothering his anger, he moved away to the window,
where he watched Mr. Talbot, who had just left the club and who at the moment was standing
on the corner making  his daily afternoon inspection of the two connecting  streets; an occupation
which Billy varied by saluting each new-corner with a slap of his cane on his checker-board
trousers and a stentorian "Bah Jove!" Waggles meanwhile squatting pensively between  his gaiters.

When an hour later the Colonel presented himself at the Horn mansion, no trace of this encounter
with Cobb was in his face nor in his manner. Men did not air their grievances in their own
nor anyone's else home around Kennedy Square.

Mrs. Horn met him with her hand extended. She had been watching for Oliver's return with a
degree of impatience rarely seen in her. She had hoped that the Colonel would have called upon
her before he went to his office, and could not understand his delay until Oliver had given
his account of the morning mishaps. She was too anxious now to chide him. It was but another
indication of his temperament, she thought--a fault to be corrected with the others that threatened
his success in life.

Holding fast to the Colonel's hand she drew him to one of the old haircloth sofas and told
him the whole story.

"Do not give the mortgage a thought, my dear Sallie," the Colonel said, In his kindest manner,
when she had finished speaking, laying his hand on her wrist. "My only regret is that it should
have caused you a moment's uneasiness. I know that our bank has lately been in need of a large
sum of money, and this loan, no doubt, was called in by the board. But it will be all right--if
not I will provide for it myself."

"No--I do not want that, and Richard, if he knew, would not be willing either. Tell me, please,
how this money is loaned," and she turned and looked earnestly into his face. "What papers
are passed, and who signs them? I have never had anything to do with such matters, and you
must explain it all clearly."

"A note signed by Richard and made payable on a certain date was given to the bank, and the
mortgage  was deposited as security."

"And if the note is not paid?"

"Then the property covered by the mortgage is sold, and the bank deducts its loan--any balance,
of course, is paid over to Richard."

"And when the sale is put off--what is done then?"

"A new note is given," and here the Colonel stopped as if in doubt, "and sometimes a second
name is placed on the note increasing the security. But, Sallie, dear, do not let this part
of it ever again cross your mind. I will attend to it should it become necessary. It is not
often," and the Colonel waved his hand gallantly, "that a Clayton can do a Horn a service."

"Thank you, dear friend, and it is just like you to wish to do it, but this I cannot agree
to. I have thought of another way since you have been talking to me. Would it--" and she stopped
and looked down on the floor, "would it be of any use if I signed a note myself? This house
we live in is my own, as you know, and would be an additional security to the bank if anything
should happen."

The offer was so unusual that the Colonel caught his breath. He looked at her in astonishment,
but her eyes never wavered. He felt instantly that, however lightly he might view the subject,
the matter was intensely  serious with her. The Colonel half rose to his feet, and with a bow
that in Kennedy Square had earned for him the title of "the Chesterfield of his time, sir,"
placed his hand on his heart.

"My dear Sallie," he said, "not a member of the board could refuse. It would at once remove
any obstacle the directors might have."

"Thank you, then we will leave it so, and I will have the papers prepared at once."

"And is this Richard's advice?" the Colonel ventured  to ask, slowly regaining his seat. There
were some misgivings still lingering in his Chesterfieldian mind as to whether the proudest
man he knew, gentle as he was, would not forbid the whole transaction.

"No. He does not know of my purpose, and you will please not tell him. He only knows that I
am opposed to allowing the property to be sold, and he has promised me that he will take no
steps in the matter without my consent. All I want you to do now is to tell him that the bank
has decided to let the matter stand. This obligation hereafter will be between me and the board,
and I will pledge myself to carry it out. And now, one thing more before you go, and I ask
this because you have seen him grow up and I know you love him. What shall I do with Oliver?"

The Colonel again caught his breath. Gallant gentleman of the old school, as he was, with a
profound respect for the other sex, the question startled him. According to his experience
and traditions, the fathers  generally looked after the welfare of the sons and found them
places in life--not the mothers.

"What do you want to do with him?" he asked, quietly.

"I want him to go to work. I am afraid this life here will ruin him."

"Why, I thought he was studying law with Ellicott."  The announcement could not have been very
surprising to the Colonel. He doubtless knew how much time Oliver spent at Judge Ellicott's office.

"He no doubt THINKS he's studying, dear friend, but he really spends half his time in old Mr.
Crocker's studio, who puts the worst possible notions into his head, and the balance of his
time he is with your Sue," and she smiled faintly.

"For which you can hardly blame him, dear lady," and the Colonel bent his head graciously.

"No, for she is as sweet as she can be, and you know I love her dearly, but they are both children,
and will be for some years. You don't want to support  them, do you? and you know Richard can't,"
and there flashed out from her eyes one of those quizzical glances which the Colonel remembered
so well in her girlhood.

The Colonel nodded his head, but he did not commit  himself. He had never for a moment imagined
that Oliver's love-affair would go as far as that, and, then again, he knew Sue.

"What do you suggest doing with him? I will help, of course, in any way I can," he said, after
a pause, during which Mrs. Horn sat watching every expression that crossed his face.

"I don't know. I have not fully made up my mind. I have been greatly disturbed over Oliver.
He seems to be passing through one of those dangerous  crises which often come to a boy. What
do you think of my sending him to New York?"

"THE NORTH, Sallie! Why, you wouldn't send Oliver up North, would you?"

The announcement this time gave the Colonel so genuine a shock that it sent the blood tingling
to his cheeks. Really, the idiosyncrasies of the Horn family were beyond his comprehension!
Evidently  Richard's vagaries had permeated his household.

"I do not like the influence of the North on our young men, my dear Madam." The Colonel spoke
now with great seriousness and with some formality, and without any of the Chesterfieldian
accompaniments  of tone or gesture. "If he were my boy, I should keep him here. He is young
and light- hearted, I know, and loves pleasure, but that will all come out of him. Let him
stay with Ellicott; he will bring him out all right. There is a brusqueness and a want of refinement
among most Northern men that have always grated on me. You can see it any day in Amos Cobb."

As he spoke a slight flush overspread his listener's face. The positiveness of his tone, she
thought, carried  with it a certain uncomplimentary criticism of her suggestion. The Colonel
saw it, and, as if in apology and to prove his case, added, in a gentler tone: "Only this afternoon
at the club I heard Cobb speaking in the most outrageous manner about our most treasured institutions.
It is not his fault perhaps. It is the fault of his breeding, but it is  unbearable all the
same. Keep Oliver here. He has a most engaging and lovable nature, is as clean and sweet as
a girl, and I haven't a doubt but what he will honor both you and his blood. Take my word for
it, and keep him at home. He is young yet, barely twenty-two--there is plenty of time for him."
And the Colonel rose from the sofa, lifted Mrs. Horn's fingers to his lips and bowed himself out.

The Colonel only told the truth, as he saw it. In his day and generation men of twenty-two
were but boys, and only gray-beards ruled the State and counting-house. The Senators were indeed
grave and reverend seigniors, and the merchants, in their old-fashioned dress-coats, looked
more like  distinguished diplomats than buyers and sellers of produce. In those days, too,
the young man with a mustache was thought presuming and dangerous, and the bank who would have
selected a cashier under forty would have caused a run on its funds in a week after the youth
had been appointed to his position.

After the Colonel's departure Mrs. Horn sat in deep thought. The critical tones of his voice
still lingered in her memory. But her judgment had not been shaken nor was her mind satisfied.
Oliver still troubled her. The Colonel's advice might be right, but she dared not rely upon it.

The next day she sent for Amos Cobb: Malachi took the message this time, not Oliver. Cobb came
on the minute. He was greatly surprised at Mrs. Horn's note, for although his wife was an intimate
friend of Mrs. Horn's, and he himself would have been welcome, he was seldom present at any
of the functions of the house and could not be considered one of its intimate guests. He did
not like music, he said to his wife, when urged to go, and, as he did not play chess or drink
Madeira, he preferred to stay at home.

Malachi relieved Amos of his hat, and conducted him into Mrs. Horn's presence with rather a
formal bow--quite different from the low salaam with which he had greeted Colonel Clayton.
"Dat bobobalish'- nest, Mister Cobb, jes' gone in de parlor," he said to Aunt Hannah when he
regained the kitchen. "Looks like he lived on parsimmons, he dat sour."

Mrs. Horn received her visitor cordially, but with a reserve which she had not maintained toward
the Colonel, for Cobb had never represented to her anything  but a money standard pure and
simple. It was only when the Colonel had mentioned his name, and then only because of her urgent
need of just such sound practical advice as she knew he could give that she had determined
to seek his services--quite as she would have consulted an architect or an attorney.

The Vermonter took his seat on the extreme edge of the sofa, squared his shoulders, pulled
up the points of his high collar, touched together the tips of all his fingers, and looked
straight at his hostess.

"I am greatly obliged to you for coming," she began,  "for I know how busy you are, but I have
a question to ask of you which I feel sure you can answer better than anyone I know. It is
about my son Oliver. I am going to be perfectly frank with you, and I want you to be equally
frank with me." And she summed up Oliver's aims, temptations, and failings with a skill that
gained the Vermonter's closest attention. "With all this," she continued, "he is affectionate,
loves me dearly, and has never disobeyed me in his life. It is his love of change that worries
me--his instability--one thing one moment, and another the next. It seems to me the only way
to break this up is to throw him completely on his own resources so that he may realize for
once what life really means. Now tell me--" and she looked searchingly into Cobb's face, as
if eager to note the effect of her question--"if he were your only son, would you, in view
of all I have told you, send him to New York to make his start in life, or would you keep him
here?"

The Vermonter's face had begun to lighten as she progressed, and had entirely cleared when
he learned why he had been sent for. He had been afraid, when he received her note, that it
had been about the mortgage.  Cobb was chairman of the Loan Committee at the bank, had personally
called attention to Richard's note being overdue, and had himself ordered its payment.

"My two boys are at school in Vermont, Madam," he answered, slowly.

"But Oliver must earn his own living," she said, earnestly. "His father will have nothing to
give him."

Cobb made no reply. He was not surprised. Most all of these aristocratic Southerners were on
their last legs. He was right about the note, he said to himself --it was just as well to have
it paid--and he made a mental memorandum to inquire about it as soon as he reached his office,
and have it pressed for settlement at once. Business matters must be kept intact.

"What do you want him to do, Madam?" he asked, looking at her keenly from under his bushy eyebrows.

"Anything to earn his bread," she replied, in a decided tone.

Cobb passed his hand over his face, pinched his chin with his thumb and forefinger, and looked
out of the window. The answer pleased him. It pleased him, too, to be consulted by the Horns
on a matter of this kind. It pleased him most of all to realize that when these aristocrats
who differed with him politically  got into a financial hole they had to send for him to help
pull them out.

For a moment the Vermonter remained in deep thought. "Here is a Southern woman," he said to
himself, "with some common-sense and with a head on her shoulders. If her husband had half
her brains I'd let the mortgage stand." Then he turned and faced her squarely, his eyes boring
into hers.

"Send him to New York, by all means, Madam, or anywhere else out of here," he said, firmly,
but with a kindly tone in his voice. "When you decide, let me know--I will give him a letter
to a business friend of mine who lives on the Hudson, a short distance above the city, who
may help him. But let me advise you to send him at once. I saw your son yesterday at the club,
and he exactly fits your measure,  except in one respect. He's got more grit in him than you
give him credit for. I looked him over pretty carefully, and if he gets in a tight place you
needn't worry about him. He'll pull out, or my name isn't Cobb. And now one thing more--" and
he rose stiffly from the sofa and buttoned up his coat-- "don't give him any pocket-money.
Chuck him out neck and heels into the world and let him shift for himself. That's the way I
was treated, and that's the way I got on. Good-day."

CHAPTER VII

A SEAT IN UNION SQUARE

Within a day's journey of Kennedy Square lay another wide breathing-space, its winding paths
worn smooth by countless hurrying feet.

Over its flat monotony straggled a line of gnarled willows, marking the wanderings of some
guileless brook long since swallowed up and lost in the mazes of the great city like many another
young life fresh from green fields and sunny hill-sides. This desert of weeds and sun-dried,
yellow grass, this kraal for scraggly trees and broken benches, breasted the rush of the great
city as a stone breasts a stream, dividing its current--one part swirling around and up Broadway
to the hills and the other flowing eastward toward Harlem and the Sound. Around its four sides,
fronting  the four streets that hemmed it in, ran a massive iron railing, socketed in stone
and made man-proof and dog-proof by four great iron gates. These gates were opened at dawn
to let the restless in, and closed at night to keep the weary out.

Above these barriers of stone and iron no joyous magnolias lifted their creamy blossoms; no
shy climbing roses played hide-and-seek, blushing scarlet when caught. Along its foot-worn
paths no drowsy Moses ceased his droning call; no lovers walked forgetful  of the world; no
staid old gentlemen wandered  idly, their noses in their books.

All day long on its rude straight-backed benches and over its thread-bare turf sprawled unkempt
women  with sick babies from the shanties; squalid, noisy children from the rookeries; beggars
in rags, and now and then some hopeless wayfarer--who for the moment  had given up his search
for work or bread and who rested or slept until the tap of a constable's club brought him to
consciousness and his feet.

At night, before the gates were closed--ten o'clock was the hour--there could always be found,
under its dim lamps, some tired girl, sitting in the light for better protection while she
rested, or some weary laborer on the way home from his long day's work, and always passing
to and fro, swinging his staff, bullying the street-rats who were playing tag among the trees,
and inspiring a wholesome awe among those hiding in the shadows, lounged some guardian of the
peace awaiting the hour when he could drive the inmates to the sidewalk and shut the gates
behind  them with a bang.

Here on one of these same straight-backed wooden seats one September night--a night when the
air was heavy with a blurred haze, through which the lamps peered as in a fog, and the dust
lay thick upon the leaves--sat our Oliver.

Outside the square--all about the iron fence, and surging past the big equestrian statue, could
be heard the roar and din of the great city--that maelstrom which now seemed ready to engulf
him. No sound of merry laughter reached him, only rumbling of countless wheels, the slow thud
of never-ending, crowded stages lumbering over the cobbles, the cries of the hucksters selling
hot corn, and the ceaseless scrapings of a thousand feet.

He had sat here since the sun had gone down watching the crowds, wondering how they lived and
how they had earned their freedom from such cares as were now oppressing him. His heart was
heavy. A long-coveted berth, meaning self-support and independence  and consequent relief to
his mother's heart, had been almost within his grasp. It was not the place he had expected
when he left home. It was much more menial and unremunerative. But he had outlived all his
bright hopes. He was ready now to take anything he could get to save him from returning  to
Kennedy Square, or what would be still worse --from asking his mother for a penny more than
she had given him. Rather than do this he would sweep the streets.

As he leaned forward on the bench, his face in his hands, his elbows on his knees, his thoughts
went back to his father's house. He knew what they were all doing at this hour; he could see
the porches crowded with the boys and girls he loved, their bright voices filling the night-air,
Sue in the midst of them, her curls about her face. He could see his father in the big chair
reading by the lamp, that dear old father who had held his hands so tenderly and spoken with
such earnestness the day before he had left Kennedy Square.

"Your mother is right," Richard had said. "I am glad you are going, my son; the men at the
North are broader-minded than we are here, and you will soon find your place among them. Great
things are ahead of us, my boy. I shall not live to see them, but you will."

He could see his mother, too, sitting by the window,  looking out upon the trees. He knew where
her thoughts lay. As his mind rested on her pale face his eyes filled with tears. "Dear old
mother," he said to himself--"I am not forgetting, dear. I am holding on. But oh, if I had
only got the place to-day, how happy you would be to-morrow."

A bitter feeling had risen in his heart, when he had opened the letter which had brought him
the news of the loss of this hoped-for situation. "This is making one's way in the world, is
it?" he had said to himself with a heavy sigh. Then the calm eyes of his mother had looked
into his again, and he had felt the pressure of the soft hand and heard the tones of her voice:

"You may have many discouragements, my son, and will often be ready to faint by the way, but
stick to it and you will win."

His bitterness had been but momentary, and he had soon pulled himself together, but his every
resource  seemed exhausted now. He had counted so on the situation--that of a shipping-clerk
in a dry- goods store--promised him because of a letter that he carried from Amos Cobb's friend.
But at the last moment the former clerk, who had been laid off because  of sickness, had been
taken back, and so the weary search for work must begin again.

And yet with everything against him Oliver had no thought of giving up the struggle. Even Amos
Cobb would have been proud of him could he have seen the dogged tenacity with which he clung
to his purpose--a tenacity due to his buoyant, happy temperament, or to his devotion to his
mother's wishes; or (and this is more than probable) to some drops of blood, perhaps, that
had reached his own through his mother's veins--the blood of that Major with the blue and buff
coat, whose portrait hung in the dining-room at home, and who in the early days had braved
the flood at Trenton side by side with the Hero of the Bronze Horse now overlooking the bench
on which Oliver sat; or it may be of that other ancestor in the queue whose portrait hung over
the mantel of the club and who had served his State with distinction in his day.

Whatever the causes of these several effects, the one dominating power which now controlled
him was his veneration for his mother's name and honor. For on the night succeeding Amos Cobb's
visit after she had dropped upon her knees and poured out her heart in prayer she had gone
into Oliver's bedroom, and shutting the door had told him of the mortgage; of his father's
embarrassment, and the danger they suffered of losing the farm--their only hope for their old
age--unless success crowned Richard's inventions. With his hand fast in hers she had given
him in exact detail all that she had done to ward off this calamity; recounting, word by word,
what she had said to the Colonel, lowering her voice almost to a whisper as she spoke of the
solemn promise she had made him--involving her own and her husband's honor--and the lengths
to which she was prepared to go to keep her obligations to the bank.

Then, her hand still clasping his, the two sitting side by side on his bed, his wondering,
startled eyes looking into hers--for this world of anxiety was an unknown world to him--she
had by slow stages made him realize how necessary it was that he, their only son, and their
sole dependence, should begin at once to earn his daily bread; not only on his own account
but on hers and his father's. In her tenderness she had not told him that the real reason was
his instability  of purpose; fearing to wound his pride, she had put it solely on the ground
of his settling down to some work.

"It is the law of nature, my son," she had added. "Everything that lives must WORK to live.
You have only to watch the birds out here in the Square to convince  you of that. Notice them
to-morrow, when you go out. See how busy they are; see how long it takes for any one of them
to get a meal. You are old enough now to begin to earn your own bread, and you must begin at
once, Ollie. Your father can no longer help you. I had hoped your profession would do this
for you, but that is not to be thought of now."

Oliver, at first, had been stunned by it all. He had never before given the practical side
of life a single thought. Everything had gone along smoothly from his earliest remembrance.
His father's house had been his home and his protection; his room with its little bed and pretty
hangings and all its comforts --a room cared for like a girl's--had always been open to him.
He had never once asked himself how these things came about, nor why they continued. These
revelations of his mother's therefore were like the sudden opening of a door covering a vault
over which he had walked unconsciously and which now, for the first time, he saw yawning beneath
him.

"Poor daddy," were his first words. "I never knew a thing about his troubles; he seems always
so happy and so gentle. I am so sorry--dear daddy-- dear dad--" he kept repeating.

And then as she spoke there flashed into his mind the thought of his own hopes. They were shattered
now. He knew that the art career was dead for him, and that all his dreams in that direction
were over.

He was about to tell her this, but he stopped before  the words were formed. He would not add
his own burden to her sorrow. No, he would bear it alone. He would tell Sue, but he would not
tell his mother. Next there welled up in his heart a desire to help this mother whom he idolized,
and this father who represented to him all that was kind and true.

"What can I do? Where can I go, dearie?" he cried with sudden resolve. "Even if I am to work
with my hands I am ready to do it, but it must be away from here. I could not do it here at
home with everybody looking on; no, not here! not here!"

This victory gained, the mother with infinite tact, little by little, unfolded to the son the
things she had planned. Finally with her arms about his neck, smoothing his cheek with her
hands she told him of Amos Cobb's advice and of his offer, adding: "He will give you a letter
to his friend who lives at Haverstraw near New York, my boy, with whom you can stay until you
get the situation you want."

The very impracticability of this scheme did not weigh with her. She did not see how almost
hopeless would be the task of finding employment in an unknown  city. Nor did the length of
time her son might be a burden on a total stranger make any difference  in her plans. Her own
home had always been open to the friends of her friends, and for any length of time, and her
inborn sense of hospitality made it impossible for her to understand any other conditions.
Then again she said to herself: "Mr. Cobb is a thoroughly practical man, and a very kind one.
His friend will welcome Oliver, or he would not have allowed my son to go." She had repeated,
however, no word of the Vermonter's advice "to chuck the boy out neck and heels into the world
and let him shift for himself," although the very Spartan quality of the suggestion, in spite
of its brusqueness, had greatly pleased her. She could not but recognize that Amos understood.
She would have faced the situation herself if she had been in her son's place; she said so
to herself. And she hoped, too, that Oliver would face it as bravely when the time came.

As for the temptations that might assail her boy in the great city, she never gave them a thought.
Neither the love of drink nor the love of play ran in her own or Richard's veins--not for generations.
back. "One test of a gentleman, my son," Richard always said, "lies in the way in which he
controls his appetites--in the way he regards his meat and drink. Both are foods for the mind
as well as for the body, and must be used as such. Gluttons and drunkards should he classed
together." No, her boy's heart might lead him astray, but not his appetites, and never his
passions. She was as sure of that as she was of his love.

As she talked on, Oliver's mind, yielding to her stronger will as clay does to a sculptor's
hand, began  to take shape. What at first had looked like a hardship now began to have an attractive
side. Perhaps  the art career need not be wholly given up. Perhaps,  too, there was a better
field for him in New York than here--old Mr. Crocker had always told him this. Then, too, there
was something of fascination  after all, in going out alone like a knight-errant to conquer
the world. And in that great Northern city, too, with its rush and whirl and all that it held
for him of mystery! How many times had Mr. Crocker  talked to him by the hour of its delights.
And Ellicott's  chair! Yes, he could get rid of that. And Sue? Sue would wait--she had promised
him she would; no, there was no doubt about Sue! She would love him all the better if he fought
his battle alone. Only the day before she had told him of the wonderful feats of the White
Knight, that the new English poet had just written about and that everybody in Kennedy Square
was now reading.

Above all there was the delight of another sensation --the sensation of a new move. This really
pleased him best. He was apparently listening to his mother when these thoughts took possession
of him, for his eyes were still fixed on hers, but he heard only a word now and then. It was
his imagination that swayed him now, not his will nor his judgment. He would have his own adventures
in the great city and see the world as Mr. Crocker had done, he said to himself.

"Yes, dearie, I'll go," he answered quickly. "Don't talk any more about it. I'll do just as
you want me to, and I'll go anywhere you say. But about the money for my expenses? Can father
give it to me?" he asked suddenly, a shade of anxiety crossing his face.

"We won't ask your father, Ollie," she said, drawing  him closer to her. She knew he would
yield to her wishes, and she loved him the better for it, if that were possible. "I have a
little money saved which I will give you. You won't be long finding a good place."

"And how often can I come back to you?" he cried, starting up. Until now this phase of the
situation  had not entered his mind.

"Not often, my boy--certainly not until you can afford it. It is costly travelling. Maybe once
or twice a year."

"Oh, then there's no use talking, I can't go. I can't--can't, be away from you that long. That's
going to be the hardest part." He had started from his seat and, stood over her, a look of
determination on his face.

"Oh, yes, you can, my son, and you will," she replied, as she too rose and stood beside him,
stopping  the outburst of his weakness with her calm voice, and quieting and soothing him with
the soft touch of her hand, caressing his cheek with her fingers as she had so often done when
he, a baby, had lain upon her breast.

Then with a smile on her face, she had kissed him good-night, closed the door, and staggering
along the corridor steadying herself as she walked, her hand on the walls, had thrown herself
upon her bed in an agony of tears, crying out:

"Oh, my boy--my boy! How can I give you up? And I know it is forever!"

And now here he is foot-sore and heart-sore, sitting  in Union Square, New York, the roar of
the great city in his ears, and here he must sit until the cattle-barge which takes him every
night to the house of Amos Cobb's friend is ready to start on her voyage up the river.

He sat with his head in his hands, his elbows on his knees, not stirring until a jar on the
other end of the bench roused him. A negro hod-carrier, splashed with plaster, and wearing
a ragged shirt and a crownless straw hat, had taken a seat beside him. The familiarity of the
act startled Oliver. No negro wayfarer would have dared so much in his own Square at home.

The man reached forward and drew closer to his own end of the bench a bundle of sawed ends
and bits of wood which he had carried across the park on his shoulder.

Oliver watched him for a moment, with a feeling amounting almost to indignation. "Were the
poverty  and the struggle of a great city to force such familiarities upon him," he wondered.
Then something  in the negro's face, as he wiped the perspiration from his forehead with the
back of his hand, produced  a sudden change of feeling. "Was this man, too, without work?"
Oliver asked himself, as he felt the negro's weariness, and realized for the first time, the
common heritage of all men.

"Are you tired, Uncle?" he asked.

"Yes, a little mite. I been a-totin' dis kindlin' from way up yander in Twenty-third Street
where the circus useter be. Dey's buildin' a big hotel dere now--de Fifth Avenue dey calls
it. I'm a-carryin' mortar for de brick-layers an' somehow dese sticks is monst'ous heavy after
workin' all day."

"Where do you live?" asked Oliver, his eyes on the kindling-wood.

"Not far from here, sah; little way dis side de Bow'ry. Whar's yo'r home?" And the old man
rose to his feet and picked up his bundle.

The question staggered Oliver. He had no home, really none that he could call his own--not now.

"Oh, a long way from here," he answered, thoughtfully, without raising his head, his voice choking.

The old negro gazed at him for a moment, touched his hat respectfully, and walked toward the
gate. At the entrance he wheeled about, balanced the bundle  of wood on his shoulder and looked
back at Oliver,  who had resumed his old position, his eyes on the ground. Then he walked away,
muttering:

"'Pears like he's one o' my own people calling me uncle. Spec' he ain't been long from his mammy."

Two street-rats now sneaked up toward Oliver, watched him for a moment, and whispered to each
other. One threw a stone which grazed Oliver's head, the other put his hand to his mouth and
yelled: "Spad, spad," at the top of his voice. Oliver understood  the epithet, it meant that
he wore clean linen, polished shoes, and perhaps, now and then, a pair of gloves. He had heard
the same outcry in his own city, for the slang of the street-rat is Volapuk the world over.
But he did not resent the assault. He was too tired to chase any boys, and too despondent to
answer their taunts.

A constable, attracted by the cries of the boys, now passed in front of him swinging his long
staff. He was about to tap Oliver's knees with one end of it, as a gentle reminder that he
had better move on, when something in the young man's face or appearance  made him change his mind.

"Hi, sonny," he cried, turning quickly and facing Olivr, "yer can't bum round here after ten,
ye know. Keep yer eyes peeled for them gates, d'ye hear?"

If Oliver heard he made no reply. He was in no mood to dispute the officer's right to order
him about. The gates were not the only openings shut in his face, he thought to himself; everything
seemed closed against him in this great city. It was not so at home on Kennedy Square. Its
fence, was a shackly, moss-covered, sagging old fence, intertwined  with honeysuckles, full
of holes and minus many a paling; where he could have found a dozen places to crawl through.
He had done so only a few weeks before with Sue in a mad frolic across the Square. Besides,
why should the constable speak to him at all? He knew all about the hour of closing the New
York gates without the policeman reminding him of it. Had he not sat here every night waiting
for that cattle-boat? He hated the place cordially, yet it was the only spot in that great
city to which he could come and not be molested while he waited for the barges. He always selected
this particular bench because it was nearest the gate that led to the bronze horse. He loved
to look at its noble contour  silhouetted against the sky or illumined by the street-lamps,
and was seldom too tired to be inspired by it. He had never seen any work in sculpture to be
compared to it, and for the first few days after his arrival, he was never content to end the
day's tramping until he stood beneath it, following its outlines,  his heart swelling with
pride at the thought that one of his own nationality and not a European  had created it. He
wished that his father, who believed so in the talent of his countrymen, could see it.

Suddenly, while he was still resenting the familiarity  of the constable, his ears were assailed
by the cry of a dog in pain; some street-rat had kicked him.

Instantly Oliver was on his feet. A small spaniel was running toward him, followed by half
a dozen boys who were pelting him with stones.

Oliver sprang forward as the dog crouched at his feet; caught him up in his arms and started
for the rats, who dodged behind the tree-trunks, calling "Spad, spad," as they ran. Then came
the voice of the same constable.

"Hi, yer can't bring that dog in here."

"He's not my dog, somebody has hurt him," said Oliver in an indifferent tone, examining carefully
the dog's legs to see if any bones were broken.

"If that ain't your dog what yer doin' with him? See here, I been a-watchin' ye. Yer got ter
move on or I'll run ye in. D'ye moind?"

Oliver's eyes flashed. In all his life no man had ever doubted his word, nor had anyone ever
spoken to him in such terms.

"You can do as you please, but I will take care of this dog, no matter what happens. You ought
to be ashamed of yourself to see him hurt, and not want to protect him. You're a pretty kind
of an officer."

A crowd began to gather.

Oliver was standing with the dog under one arm, holding the little fellow close to his breast,
the other bent with fist tight shut as if to defend himself.

"I am, am I? yer moon-faced spad! I'll show ye," and he sprang toward Oliver.

"Here now, Tim Murphy," came a sharp voice, "kape yer hands off the young gintleman. He ain't
a-doin' nothin', and he ain't done nothin'. Thim divils hit the dog, I seen 'em myself."

The officer turned quickly and faced a big, broad- shouldered Irish woman, bare-headed, her
sleeves rolled up to her elbows, every line in her kindly face replete with indignation.

"Don't put yer hands on him, or I'll go to the lock-up an' tell McManus."

"Oh, it's you, is it, Mrs. Mulligan?" said the officer, in a conciliatory tone.

"Yes, it's me. The young gintleman's right. It's the b'ys ye oughter club into shape, not be
foolin' yer time over the dog."

"Well, ye know it's agin the rules to let dogs inside  the gates," he retorted as he continued
his stroll along the walk, swinging his club as he went, puffing out his chest and cheeks with
his old air as he moved toward the gate.

"Yes, an' so it's agin the rules," she called after him, "to have them rapscallions yellin'
like mad an' howlin' bloody murder when a body comes up here to git a breath o' air."

"Is the dog hurt, sir?" and she stepped close to Oliver and laid her big hand on the dog's
head, as it lay nestling close to Oliver's side.

"No, I don't think so--he would have been if I had not got him."

The dog, under the caress, raised his head, and a slight movement of his tail expressed his
pleasure. Then his ears shot forward. A young man about Oliver's own age was rapidly walking
up the path, with a quick, springy step, whistling as he came. The dog, with a sudden movement,
squirmed himself from under Oliver's arm and sprang toward him.

"Oh, it's you, Mr. Fred, is it?" broke out the woman, "and it's Miss Margaret's dog, too. Of
course it's her dog, an' I was that dumb I didn't know it.	But it's not me ye can thank for
savin' its skin --it's the young gintleman here. Them divils would have killed it but for him."

"Is the dog yours, sir?" asked Oliver, raising his hat with that peculiar manner of his which
always won him friends at first sight.

"No, I wish it were. It's Miss Margaret Grant's dog--one of our students. I am taking care
of it while she is away. The little rascal ran out and got into the Square before I knew it.
I live right across the street--you can see my house from here. Miss Grant will be ever so
much obliged to you for protecting  him."

"Oh, don't mention it. I got hold of him just in time, or these ruffians would have hurt him.
I think the old lady here, however, is most to be thanked. We might both have been locked up,"
he added, smiling, "if she had not interfered. You know her, it seems."

"Yes, she's Mother Mulligan, as we call her. She's janitress of the Academy of Design, where
I draw at night. My name's Fred Stone. Come over to where I live--it's only a step," and he
looked straight into Oliver's face, his big blue eyes never wavering.

"Well, I will if you don't think it's too late," and the two young fellows, with a wave of
their hands to the old woman, left the Square, the dog bounding before  them.

Within the hour--in less time indeed, for the friendly light in the eyes of his new-found friend
had shone straight into our boy's soul, warming and cheering him to his finger-tips, opening
his heart, and bringing out all his secrets--Oliver had told Fred the story of his fruitless
tramps for work; of his mother's  hopes and fears; of his own ambitions and his aims. And Fred,
his own heart wide open, had told Oliver with equal frankness the story of his own struggles;
of his leaving his father's farm in the western part of the State, and of his giving up everything
to come to New York to study art.

It was the old, old story of two chance acquaintances  made friends by reason of the common
ground of struggle and privation on which they stood; comrades  fighting side by side in the
same trenches for the same end, and both dreaming of the morrow which would always bring victory
and never death. A story told without reserve, for the disappointments of life had not yet
dulled their enthusiasm, nor had the caution acquired by its many bitter experiences yet checked
the free flow of their confidences.

To Oliver, in his present despondent mood, the hand held out to him was more than the hand
of a comrade. It was the hand of a strong swimmer thrust into the sea to save a drowning man.
There were others then besides himself, he thought, as he grasped it, who were making this
fight for bread and glory; there was something else in the great city besides  cruelty and
misery, money-getting and money- spending--something of unselfishness, sympathy and love.

The two sat on the steps of Fred's boarding-house --that house where Oliver was to spend so
many happy days of his after-life--until there was only time enough to catch the barge. Reluctantly
he bade his new-found comrade good-by and, waving his hand, turned the corner in the direction
of the dock.

The edge of Oliver's cloud had at last caught the light!

CHAPTER VIII

AN OLD SONG

Not only had the sunshine of a new friendship illumined the edge of Oliver's clouds, but before
the week was out a big breeze laden with success had swept them so far out to sea, that none
but the clearest  of skies radiant with hope now arched above his happy face.

A paste-board sign had wrought this miracle.

One day he had been tramping the lower parts of the city, down among the docks, near Coenties
Slip, looking up the people who on former visits had said: "Some other time, perhaps," or "If
we should have room for another man we will be glad to remember you," or "We know Mr. Cobb,
and shall be pleased," etc., etc., when he chanced to espy a strange sign tacked outside a
warehouse door, a sign which bore the unheard-of-announcement--unheard of to Oliver,  especially
the last word, "Shipping Clerk WANTED."

No one, for weeks, had WANTED anything that Oliver  could furnish. Strangely enough too, as
he afterward  discovered, the bullet-headed Dutch porter had driven the last tack into the
clean, white, welcome face of the sign only five minutes before Oliver stopped in front of
it. Still more out of the common,  and still more incomprehensible, was the reply made to him
by the head salesman, whom he found just inside the door--a wiry, restless little man with
two keen black eyes, and a perfectly bald head.

"Yes, if you can mark boxes decently; can show any references; don't want too much pay, and
can come NOW. We're short of a boy, and it's our busy season."

Oh! blessed be Mr. Crocker, thought Oliver, as he picked up a marking-brush, stirred it round
and round in the tin pot filled with lamp-black and turpentine,  and to his own and the clerk's
delight, painted, on a clean board, rapidly and clearly, and in new letters  too--new to the
clerk--the full address of the bald-headed man's employers:

MORTON, SLADE & CO., 121 PEARL STREET, NEW YORK.

More amazing still were the announcements made by the same bald-headed man after Oliver had
shown him Amos Cobb's recommendations: Oliver was to come to work in the morning, the situation
to be permanent  provided Cobb confirmed by letter the good wishes he had previously expressed,
and provided Mr. Morton, the senior partner, approved of the bald- head's action; of which
the animated billiard-ball said there was not the slightest doubt as he, the ball, had charge
of the shipping department, and was responsible  for its efficiency.

All of these astounding, incomprehensible and amazing occurrences Oliver had written to his
mother, ending his letter by declaring in his enthusiasm  that it was his art, after all, which
had pulled him through, and that but for his readiness with the brush, he would still be a
tramp, instead of "rolling in luxury on the huge sum of eight dollars a week, with every probability
of becoming a partner in the house, and later on a millionnaire." To which the dear lady had
replied, that she was delighted to know he had pleased his employers, but that what had pleased
her most was his never having lost heart while trying to win his first fight, adding: "The
second victory will come more easily, my darling boy, and so will each one hereafter." Poor
lady, she never knew how sore that boy's feet had been, nor how many times he had gone with
half a meal or none at all, for fear of depleting too much the small store she had given him
when he left home.

With his success still upon him, he had sallied forth to call upon young Fred Stone who had
grasped his hand so warmly the night he had rescued the dog from the street-boys, and whose
sympathy had gone out to him so freely. He had written him of his good fortune, and Fred had
replied, begging him to call upon him, and had appointed this same Friday night as the night
of all others when he could entertain him best.

But Oliver is not the same boy who said good-by to Fred that moonlight night the week before.
His eyes are brighter; his face is a-glow with ill-concealed  pleasure. Even his step shows
the old-time spring and lightness of the days at home--on his toes part of the time, as if
restraining an almost  uncontrollable impulse to stop and throw one or two hand- springs just
to relieve the pressure on his nerves.

When he reached the bench in the Square where he had sat so many nights with his head in his
hands, one of those quick outbursts of enthusiasm took possession  of him, the kind that sets
young hearts singing  with joy when some sudden shift of hope's kaleidoscope  opens a wide
horizon brilliant with the light of future success. With an exclamation of boyish glee he plumped
himself down upon the hard planks of the bench, and jumped up again, pirouetting on his toe
and slanting his hat over one eye as if in a spirit of sheer bravado against fate. Then he
sauntered  out of the iron gate to Fred's house.

Even as he waited on the stone steps of Miss Teeturn's  boarding-house for the dowdy servant-girl's
return--such dirty, unkempt steps as they were, and such a dingy door-plate, spotted with rain
and dust, not like Malachi's, he thought--he could hardly restrain  himself from beating Juba
with his foot, a plantation trick Malachi had taught him, keeping time the while with the palms
of his hands on his shapely legs.

Meanwhile another young enthusiast is coming downstairs three steps at a time, this one bare-
headed, all out of breath, and without a coat, who pours out his heart to the first Juba-beating
enthusiast  as the two climb the stairs together to the second enthusiast's room on the very
top floor. He tells him of his delight at seeing him again and of the lot of fellows waiting
to welcome him under the skylight;  and of what a jolly lot the "Skylarkers" really are; and
of Mr. Slade, Oliver's employer, whom Fred knows and who comes from Fred's own town; and of
how much Mr. Slade likes a certain new clerk, one Oliver Horn, of Kennedy Square, he having
said so the night before, this same Horn being the precise individual whose arm at that very
moment was locked in Fred's own and which was now getting an extra squeeze merely for the purposes
of identification.

All of this Fred poured into Oliver's willing ear without stopping to take breath, as they
mounted the four long flights of stairs that led to the top floor, where, under the roof, there
lived a group of Bohemians as unique in their personalities as could be found the great city over.

When the two pairs of feet had at last reached the last flight of steps under the flat roof
of the house, the "Skylarkers" were singing "Old Dog Tray" at the top of their voices, to the
accompaniment  of a piano, and of some other instruments, the character of which our young
hero failed to recognize,  although the strains had grown louder and louder as the young men
mounted the stairs.

As Oliver stood in the open doorway and looked in through the haze of tobacco-smoke upon the
group, he instantly became conscious that a new world had opened before him; a world, as he
had always pictured  it, full of mystery and charm, peopled by a race as fascinating to him
as any Mr. Crocker had ever described, and as new and strange as if its members had been the
denizens of another planet.

The interior was not a room, but a square low-ceiled hall into which opened some six or more
small bedrooms, slept in, whenever sleep was possible, by an equal number of Miss Teetum's
boarders.  The construction and appointments of this open garret, with two exceptions, were
similar to those of all other garrets of its class: it had walls and  ceiling, once whitewashed,
and now discolored by roof- leaks from a weather-beaten skylight; its floor was bare of carpet,
and its well-worn woodwork was stained with time and use. Chairs, however, were scarce, most
of the boarders and their guests being seated on the floor.

The two exceptions, already noted, were some crisp, telling sketches, big and little, in color
and black-and- white, the work of the artist members of this coterie, which covered every square
inch of the leak-stained surface of ceiling and wall, and the yellow-keyed, battered piano
which occupied the centre of the open space and which stood immediately under two flaring gas-jets.
At the moment of Fred's and Oliver's arrival  the top of this instrument was ornamented by
two musically inclined gentlemen, one seated cross- legged like a Turk, voicing the misfortunes
of Dog Tray, the other, with his legs resting on a chair, beating  time to the melody with
a cane. This cane, at short intervals, he brought down upon the shoulders of any ambitious
member who attempted to usurp his place. The chief object of the gathering, so far as Oliver's
hasty glance could determine, was undoubtedly  the making of as much noise as possible.

While the young men stood looking into the room waiting for the song to cease prior to Oliver's
entry and introduction, Fred whispered hurriedly into his guest's ear some of the names, occupations,
and  characteristics of the group before him.

The cross-legged man with the long neck, drooping  mustache, and ropy black hair, was none
other than Bowdoin, the artist--the only American who had taken a medal at Munich for landscape,
but who was now painting portraits and starving slowly in consequence. He mounted to this eyry
every Friday  night, so as to be reminded of the good old days at Schwartz's. The short, big-mustached,
bald- headed man swinging the cane, was Bianchi--Julius Bianchi--known to the Skylarkers as
"The Pole," and to the world at large as an accomplished lithographer  and maker of mezzotints.
Bianchi was a piece of the early artistic driftwood cast upon our shores--an artist every inch
of him--drawing from life, and handling the crayon like a master.

The pale-faced young fellow at the piano, with bulging watch-crystal eye-glasses and hair tucked
behind  his ears, was the well-known, all-round musician, Wenby Simmons--otherwise known as
"Pussy Me-ow" --a name associated in some way with the strings of his violin. This virtuoso
played in the orchestra at the Winter Garden, and occupied the bedroom next to Fred's.

The clean-shaven, well-groomed young Englishman  standing behind Simmons and holding a coal-
scuttle half full of coal which he shook with deafening  jangle to help swell the chorus, was
"My Lord Cockburn" so called--an exchange clerk in a banking- house. He occupied the room opposite
Fred's.

With the ending of the chorus Fred Stone stepped into the open space with his arm through that
of his guest, and the noise was hushed long enough for the entire party to welcome the young
Southerner--a welcome which kindled into a glow of enthusiasm when they caught the look of
frank undisguised pleasure  which lighted his face, and noticed the unaffected bow with which
he entered the room, shaking hands with each one as Fred introduced him--and all with that
warm, hearty, simple, courteous manner peculiar to his people.

The slight ceremony over--almost every Friday night some new guest was welcomed--Fred seated
himself on the floor with his back to the whitewashed wall, although two chairs were at once
offered them, and made room for Oliver, who settled down beside him.

As they sat leaning back, Oliver's eyes wandering over the room drinking in the strange, fascinating
scene before him, as bewildering as it was unexpected, Fred--now that they were closer to the
scene of action, again whispered or shouted, as the suddenly revived noise permitted, into
Oliver's alert and delighted ears, such additional facts concerning the other members present
as he thought would interest his guest.

The fat man behind the piano astride of a chair, a pipe in his mouth and a black velvet skull-cap
on his head, was Tom Waller, the sheep-painter-Thomas Brandon Waller, he signed it--known as
the Walrus.  He, too, was a boarder and a delightful fellow, although an habitual grumbler.
His highest ambition  was to affix an N. A. at the end of his name, but he had failed of election
by thirty votes out of forty cast. That exasperating event he had duly celebrated  at Pfaff's
in various continued libations covering a week, and had accordingly, on many proper and improper
occasions, renewed and recelebrated the event, breathing out meanwhile, between his pewter
mugs, scathing anathemas against the "idiots" who had defeated him out of his just rights,
and who were stupid enough to believe in the school of Verboeckhoeven. Slick and shiny Verboeckhoeven,
"the mechanic,"  he would call him, with his fists closed tight, who painted the hair on every
one of his sheep as if it were curled by a pair of barber's tongs--not dirty and woolly and
full of suggestions as, of course, he --the great Waller, alone of all living animal-painters
--depicted it. All of which, to Waller's credit, it must be parenthetically stated, these same
"idiots" learned to recognize in after years as true, when that distinguished animal-painter
took a medal at the Salon for the same picture which the Jury of N. A.'s had rejected at their
Spring Exhibition.

The irreproachable, immaculate young person, with eyes half-closed, lying back in the arm-chair--
one which he had brought from his own room--was "Ruffle-shirt" Tomlins. He was the only member
who dressed every day for dinner, whether he was going out afterward or not--spike-tailed coat,
white tie and all. Tomlins not only knew intimately a lady of high degree who owned a box at
the Academy of Music, in Fourteenth Street, and who invited him to sit in it at least once
a season, but he had besides a large visiting acquaintance among the people of quality living
on Irving Place. A very agreeable and kindly little man was "Ruffle-shirt" Tomlins-- so Fred
said--the sort of a little man whose philosophy  of life was based on the possibility of catching
more innocent, unwary flies with honey than he could with vinegar, and who, in consequence,
always said nice things about everybody--sometimes in a loud tone enough for everybody to hear.
This last statement  of Fred's Tomlins confirmed ten minutes later by remarking, in a stage
whisper to Waller:

"Did you see how that young Mr. Horn entered the room? Nobody like these high-bred Southerners,
my boy. Quite the air of a man of the world-- hasn't he?" To all of which the distinguished
sheep- painter made no other reply than a slight nod of the head, as he blew a cloud of smoke
toward the ceiling --Tomlins's immaculate appearance being a constant offence to the untidy
painter.

The member with the stentorian voice, who was roaring out his opinions to Cockburn, Fred continued,
was "Fog-horn" Cranch, the auctioneer. His room was next to Waller's. His weaknesses were gay-colored
waistcoats and astounding cravats. He varied these portions of his dress according to wind,
weather, and sales of the day--selecting blue for sunshiny  mornings, black for rainy ones,
green for pictures,  red for household furniture, white for real estate, etc. Into these color-schemes
he stuck a variety  of scarf-pins--none very valuable or rare, but each one distinct--a miniature
ivory skull, for instance,  with little garnets for eyes, or tiny onyx dice with sixes on all
sides.

The one man of all the others most beloved by Fred and every other boarder, guest, and habitue
that gathered around the piano in this garret-room, and now conspicuous by his absence, he
having gone to the circus opposite the Academy of Music, and not likely to return until late--a
fact greatly regretted by Fred who made this announcement with lowered voice to Oliver--was
a young Irishman by the name of McFudd--Cornelius McFudd, the life of the house, and whom Waller,
in accordance with the general  custom, had christened "Continuous McFuddie,"  by reason of
the nature of the Hibernian's habits. His room was across the open space opposite Fred's, with
windows overlooking the yard.

This condensation of good-nature, wit, and good- humor, Fred went on to say, had been shipped
to "The States" by his father, a rich manufacturer of Irish whiskies in Dublin, that he might
learn something  of the ways of the New World. And there was not the slightest doubt in the
minds of his comrades,  so Fred assured Oliver, that he had not only won his diploma, but that
the sum of his knowledge along several other lines far exceeded that of any one of his contemporaries.
His allowances came regularly  every month, through the hands of Cockburn, who had known him
in London, and whose bank cashed McFudd's remittances--a fact which enabled my lord to a greater
extent than the others to keep an eye on the Irishman's movements and expenditures.

Whatever deviltry was inaugurated on this top floor during the day as well as the night, and
it was pretty constant, could be traced without much difficulty  to this irrepressible young
Irishman. If Tomlins  found his dress-suit put to bed, with a pillow for a body and his crush-hat
for a head; or Cranch found Waller's lay-figure (Waller often used his bedroom as a studio)
sitting bolt upright in his easy-chair, with its back to him reading a newspaper--the servant
having been told to announce to Cranch, the moment she opened the door, that "a gentleman was
waiting for him in his room"; or Cockburn was sent off on some wild-goose chase uptown--it
was safe to say that Mac was at the bottom of it all.

If, Fred added impressively, this rollicking, devil- may-care, perfectly sound and hearty young
Hibernian  had ever been absolutely, entirely, and completely  sober since his sojourn in the
land of the free, no one of his fellow-boarders had ever discovered  it.

Of this motley gathering "Ruffle-shirt" Tomlins, the swell; "Fog-horn" Cranch, the auctioneer;
"Walrus" Waller, the sheep-painter; "My Lord" Cockburn, the Englishman; Fred Stone and Cornelius
McFudd, not only occupied the bedrooms, but had seats at Miss Teetum's table, four flights
below. Bianchi and the others were the guests of the evening.

All this, and more, Fred poured into Oliver's willing  ear in loud or soft tones, dependent
upon the particular  kind of bedlam that was loose in the room at the moment, as they sat side
by side on the floor, Oliver's  back supported by a pillow which Tomlins had brought from his
own bed and tucked behind his shoulders with his own hand.

This courtesy had been followed by another, quite as comforting and as thoughtful. Cockburn,
the moment  Oliver's back touched the wall, had handed him a tooth-brush mug without a handle,
filled to the brim with a decoction of Cockburn's own brewing, compounded  hot according to
McFudd's receipt, and poured from an earthen pitcher kept within reach of Cockburn's hand,
and to which Oliver, in accordance with his habitual custom, had merely touched his lips, he
being the most temperate of young gentlemen.

While they talked on, stopping now and then to listen to some outburst of Cranch, whose voice
drowned all others--or to snatches of song from Wenby  Simmons, the musician, or from Julius
Bianchi, Waller's voice managed to make itself felt above the din with an earnestness that
gained the attention and calmed all the others.

"You don't know what you're all talking about," he was heard to say. He was still astride his
chair, his pipe in his hand. "Inness's picture was the best thing we had in the Exhibition,
except Eastman Johnson's 'Negro Life at the South.' Kensett's 'Lake George' was--"

"What--that Inness smear?" retorted "My Lord" Cockburn, who still stood with the coal-scuttle
in his hand ready for another chorus. "Positively, Waller, you Americans amuse me. Do you really
think that you've got anybody about you who can paint anything worth having--"

"Oh! oh! Hear the high-cockalorum! Oh! oh!"

The sheep-painter raised his hand to command silence.

"Do I think we've got anybody about here who can paint?--you fog-headed noodle from Piccadilly?
We've got a dozen young fellows in this very town that put more real stuff into their canvases
than all your men put together. They don't tickle their things to death with detail. They get
air and vitality and out-of-doors into their work, and--"

"Names! Names!" shouted "My Lord" Cockburn,  rattling the scuttle to drown the answers to his
questions.

"George Inness for one, and young McEntee and Sanford Gifford, and Eastman Johnson, Page, Casilear
--a lot of them," shouted "The Walrus." "Go to the Exhibition and see for yourself, and you--"

The rest of the discussion was lost to Oliver's ears owing to the roar of Cranch's fog-horn,
accompanied by another vigorous shaking of the scuttle, which the auctioneer caught away from
"My Lord" Cockburn's  grasp, and the pounding of Simmons's fingers on the yellow keys of the
wheezy piano.

The tribute to Inness had not been missed by Oliver,  despite the deafening noise accompanying
its utterance. He remembered another green smear, that hung in Mr. Crocker's studio, to which
that old enthusiast always pointed as the work of a man who would yet be heard from if he lived.
He had never appreciated it himself at the time, but now he saw that Mr. Crocker must be right.

Someone now started the chorus--

Down among the dead men, down.

Instantly every man was on his feet crowding about the piano, Oliver catching the inspiration
of the moment and joining in with the others. The quality of his voice must have caught the
ear of some of the singers, for they gradually lowered their tones; leaving  Oliver's voice
almost alone.

Fred's eye glowed with pleasure. His new-found friend was making a favorable impression. He
at once urged Oliver to sing one of his own Southern songs as the darkies sung them at home,
and not as they were caricatured by the end men in the minstrel shows.

Oliver, at first abashed, and then anxious to contribute  something of his own in return for
all the pleasure they had given him, hummed the tune for Simmons, and in the hush that followed
began one of the old plantation songs that Malachi had taught him, beginning with

De old black dog he bay at de moon, Away down yan ribber. Miss Bull-frog say she git dar soon,
Away down yan ribber.

As the melody rang through the room, now full and strong, now plaintive as the cooing of a
dove or the moan of a whippoorwill, the men stood stock-still, their wondering eyes fixed on
the singer, and it was not until the timely arrival of the Bull-frog and the escape of her
lover had been fully told that the listening  crowd allowed themselves to do much more than
breathe. Then there came a shout that nearly raised the roof. The peculiar sweetness of Oliver's
voice, the quaintness of the melody, the grotesqueness of his gestures--for it was pantomime
as well as music --and the quiet simplicity and earnestness with which it had all been done,
had captivated every man in the room. It was Oliver's first triumph--the first in all his life.

And the second was not far off, for in the midst of all the uproar that followed, as he resumed
his place on the floor, Cockburn sprang to his feet and proposed Mr. Oliver Horn as a full
member of the Skylarkers' Club. This was carried unanimously, and a committee of two, consisting
of "Ruffle-shirt" Tomlins and Waller, were forthwith appointed to acquaint the said member,
who stood three feet away, of his election, and to escort him to Tomlins's chair-- the largest
and most imposing-looking one in the room. This action was indorsed by the shouts and cat-calls
of all present, accompanied by earthquake shakings of the coal-scuttle and the rattling of
chairlegs  and canes on the floor.

Oliver rose to his feet and stood blushing like a girl, thanking those about him in halting
sentences for the honor conferred upon him. Then he stammered  something about his not deserving
their praise, for he could really sing very few songs--only those he had sung at home to help
out an occasional chorus, and that he would be delighted to join in another song if any one
of the gentlemen present would start the tune.

These last suggestions being eminently distasteful to the group, were immediately drowned in
a series of protests, the noise only ceasing when "Fog-horn" Cranch mounted a chair and in
his best real estate voice commanded silence.

"Ladies and Gentlemen," thundered the auctioneer,  "I have the honor to announce that the great
barytone, Mr. Oliver Horn, known to the universe as the 'Musical Cornucopia,' late of the sunny
South, and now a resident of this metropolis, will delight this company by singing one of those
soul-moving plantation melodies which have made his name famous  over two hemispheres. Mr.
'Pussy Me-ow' Simmons, the distinguished fiddling pianist, late of the Bowery, very late, I
may remark, and now on the waiting list at Wallack's Theatre--every other month, I am told--will
accompany him."

"Hear! Hear!" "Horn! Horn!" "Don't let him get away, Fred." "Song! Song!" was heard all over
the room.

Oliver again tried to protest, but he was again shouted down by cries of--

"None of that!" "Can't fool us." "You know a barrel of 'em." "Song! Song!"

Cranch broke in again--"Mr. Horn's modesty, gentlemen, greatly endears him to his fellow-members,
and we love him the better for it, but all the same--" and he raised his hand with the same
gesture  he would have used had it held an auctioneer's hammer-- "All in favor of his singing
again say 'Aye!' Going! Going! Gone! The ayes have it." In the midst of the cheering Cranch
jumped from the chair and taking Oliver by the hand as if he had been a young prima donna at
her first appearance, led him to the piano with all the airs and graces common to such an occasion.

Our young hero hesitated a moment, looked about in a pleased but helpless way, and nerving
himself tried to collect his thoughts sufficiently to recall some one of the songs that were
so familiar to him at home. Then Sue's black eyes looked into his--there must always be a woman
helping Oliver--and the strains of the last song he had sung with her the night before he left
home floated through his brain. (These same eyes were gazing into another's at the moment,
but our young Oliver was unconscious of that lamentable fact.)

"Did you ever happen to hear 'The Old Kentucky Home'?" Oliver asked Simmons. "No? Well, it
goes this way," and he struck the chords.

"You play it," said Simmons, rising from the stool.

"Oh, I can only play the chords, and not all of them right--" and he took Simmons's seat. "Perhaps
I can get through--I'll try it," he added, simply, and squared himself before the instrument
and began the melody.

As the words rolled from his lips Oliver seemed to forget the scene before him. Somehow he
could see the light in Sue's eyes, as she listened, and hear her last words. He could hear
the voice of his mother, and feel her hand on his head; and then, as the soft vowels and cadences
of the quaint melody breathed themselves out, he could catch again the expression of delight
on the face of Malachi--who had taught him the song--as he listened, his black cheek in his
wrinkled palm. It was a supreme moment with Oliver. The thrill of happiness that had quivered
through him for days, intensified by this new heaven of Bohemia, vibrated in every note he uttered.

The effect was equally startling on those about him. Cranch craned his head, and for once lowered
his voice to a whisper in speaking to the man next him. Bowdoin, the painter, and one of the
guests, left his seat and tip-toed to the piano, his eyes riveted on Oliver's face, his whole
being absorbed in the melody. Bianchi and Waller so far lost themselves that their pipes went
out, while Simmons was so entranced  that he forgot to applaud when Oliver finished.

The effect produced was not so much due to the quality in Oliver's voice--sweet and sympathetic
as it was--nor to his manner of singing, nor to the sentiment  of the song itself, but to the
fact of its being, with its clear, sweet notes, a positive contrast to all of noise and clamor
that had gone before. This fact, more than any other, made his listeners hold their breath
in wonder and delight. It came like the song of a bird bursting out after a storm and charming
everyone with the beauty of its melody, while the thunder of the tempest still reverberated
through the air.

In the hush of the death-like stillness that followed, the steady tramp of feet was heard on
the staircase, and the next instant the head of a young man, with a rosy face and side-chop
coachman whiskers,  close-cut black hair and shoe-button eyes, glistening with fun, was craned
around the jamb of the door.

It was the property of Mr. Cornelius McFudd!

He was in full evening dress, and as immaculate as if he had stepped out of a bandbox.

Whatever stimulants had permeated his system and fired his imagination had evidently escaped
his legs, for they were as steady as those of a tripod. His entrance, in a measure, restored
the assemblage to its normal condition. Mr. McFudd raised his hand impressively, checking the
customary outbreak that always greeted his appearance on occasions like this, struck a deprecatory
attitude and said, solemnly, in a rich, North-of-Ireland accent:

"Gentlemen, it is with the greatest surprise that I find ye contint to waste your time over
such riotous proceedings as I know have taken place here to-night, when within a block of yez
is a perfarmance that would delight yer souls. Think of a man throwing a hand-spring over--"

At this instant a wet sponge was fired point blank from an open bedroom door, missed McFudd's
head by an inch and bounded down the staircase.

"Thank ye, Admiral Lord Cockburn, for yer civility,"  cried McFudd, bowing low to the open
bedroom door, "and for yer good intintions, but ye missed it as yer did yer mither's blessing--and
as ye do most of the things ye try io hit." This was said without raising his voice or changing
a muscle of his face, his eyes fixed on the door inside of which stood Cockburn.

McFudd continued, "The perfarmance of this acrobat is one of the--"

Cries of "Don't you see you disturb the music?" "Go to bed!" "Somebody sit on McFudd!" etc.,
filled the room.

"Go on, gentlemen. Continue your insults; defame  the name of an honest man who is attimpting
to convey to yer dull comprehinsions some idea of the wonders of the acrobatic ring. I'll turn
a hand-spring  for yez meself that will illustrate what I mane," and Mr. McFudd carefully removed
his coat and began  sliding up his shirt-cuffs.

At this juncture "My Lord" Cockburn, who had come from behind the door, winked significantly
at Waller, and creeping on all fours behind McFudd, just as that gentleman was about lifting
his legs aloft, swept him off his feet by a twist of his arm, and deposited  him on the small
of his back next to Oliver, his head resting against the wall. There Waller stood over him
with a chair, which he threatened to turn over him upside down and sit on if the prostrate
Irishman moved an inch.

McFudd waved his hand sadly as if in acquiescence to the inscrutable laws of fate, begged the
gentlemen present to give no further thought to his existence, and after a moment of silence
continued his remarks on the acrobatic ring to Oliver in the same monotonous  tone of voice
which he had addressed to the room before Cockburn's flank movement had made him bite the dust.

"It may seem to you, Mr.-- Mr.--, I haven't your name, sir," and he bent his head toward Oliver.

"Horn, sir," Oliver suggested. "Oliver Horn."

"Thanks, it may seem to you that I'm exaggerating,  Mr. Oliver Horn, the wonder of this perfarmance,
but-"

The rest of the sentence, despite the Hibernian's well-intentioned efforts, was not addressed
to Oliver, but to the room at large, or rather to its furniture, or to be still more exact,
to the legs of the piano, and such chairs and tables as the Irishman's prostrate body bumped
into on the way to his room. For at that instant Waller, to save Oliver, as he pretended, from
further annoyance, had caught the distinguished Hibernian by both feet, and in that position
dragged him along the floor, as if he had been a wheelbarrow, McFudd's voice never changing
its tone as he continued  his remarks on physical culture, and the benefits  which would accrue
to the human race if they would practice the acrobat's hand-spring.

When Fred and Oliver had closed their bedroom door for the night, the guests having departed
and all the regular boarders being supposedly secure in their beds (Fred without much difficulty
had persuaded  Oliver to share his own bed over night), there came a knock at Fred's door,
and the irrepressible Irishman stalked in.

He had removed his vest, high collar, and shoes, and had the air and look of an athlete. The
marvellous  skill of the acrobat still occupied his mind.

"Don't disturb yourself, my dear Stone, but me deloightful conversation with yer friend, Mr.
Horn, was interrupted by that wild beast of a Waller, and I wanted to finish it. I am quite
sure I can do it--the trick I was telling ye of. I've been practizing in me room. It's as easy
as rolling off a jaunting car."

"No, Mac, old man. Go to bed again," pleaded Fred.

"Not till I show ye, me boy, one of the most beautiful  feats of agility--"

"Come off, Mac, I say," cried Fred, catching the Irishman around the waist.

"I'll come nothing! Unhand me, gentlemen, or by the--" and tearing himself free McFudd threw
a hand-spring with the ease of a professional, toppled, for a moment, his feet in the air,
scraped along the whitewashed wall with his heels, and sweeping the basins and pitchers filled
with water from the wash- stand measured his length on the floor. Then came the crash of broken
china, a deluge of water, and Fred and Oliver began catching up sponges and towels  to stay
the flood.

A minute later a man in a long gray beard and longer night-robe--one of the regular boarders--
bounded up the stairs two steps at a time and dashed through Fred's open door.

"By thunder, boys!" he cried, "I don't mind how much noise you make, rather like it; but what
the devil are you trying to drown us out for? Wife is soaking--it's puddling down on our bed."

By this time every door had been flung open, and the room was filled with half-dressed men.

"It's that lunatic, McFudd. He's been to the circus  and thinks he's Martello," cried Fred,
pointing to the prostrate Irishman with the sponge which he had been squeezing out in the coal-scuttle.

"Or the clown," remarked Waller, stooping over McFudd, who was now holding his sides and roaring
with laughter.

Long after Fred had fallen asleep, Oliver lay awake thinking of the night's pleasure. He had
been very, very happy--happier than he had been for many months. The shouts of approval on
his election to membership, the rounds of applause that had followed  his rendering of the
simple negro melodies, resounded in his ears, and the joy of it all still tingled through his
veins. This first triumph of his life had brought with it a certain confidence in himself--a
new feeling of self-reliance--of being able to hold his own among men, something he had never
experienced  before. This made it all the more exhilarating.

And the company!

Real live painters who sold their pictures and who had studied in Munich, and who knew Paris
and Dresden and all the wonderful cities of which Mr. Crocker had talked. And real musicians,
too!--who played at theatres; and Englishmen from London, and Irishmen from Dublin, and all
so jolly and  unconventional and companionable. It was just as Mr. Crocker had described it,
and just what he had about despaired of ever finding. Surely his cup of happiness  was full
to the brim.

We can forgive him; we who still remember those glimpses behind the scenes--our first and never-to-
be-forgotten! How real everything seemed, even the grease-paint, the wigs, and the clothes.
And the walking gentleman and the leading old man and low comedian! What splendid fellows they
were and how we sympathized with them in their enforced  exiles from a beloved land. How they
suffered  from scheming brothers who had robbed them of their titles and estates, or flint-hearted
fathers who had turned them out of doors because of their infatuation for their "art" or because
of their love for some dame of noble birth or simple lass, whose name--"Me boy, will be forever
sacred!" How proud we were of knowing them, and how delighted  they were at knowing us--and
they so much older too! And how tired we got of it all--and of them--and of all their kind
when our eyes became accustomed to the glare and we saw how cheap and commonplace it all was
and how much of its glamour and charm had come from our own inexperience and enthusiasm--and youth.

As Oliver lay with wide-open eyes, going over every incident of the evening, he remembered,
with a certain touch of exultant pride, a story his father had told him of the great Poe, and
he fell to wondering  whether the sweetness of his own song, falling on ears stunned by the
jangle of the night, had not produced  a similar effect. Poe, his father had said, on being
pressed for a story in the midst of a night of revelry in a famous house on Kennedy Square,
had risen from his seat and repeated the Lord's Prayer with such power and solemnity that the
guests, one and all, stunned and sobered, had pushed their chairs from the table and had left
the house. He remembered  just where his father sat when he told the story and the impression
it had made upon him at the time. He wished Kennedy Square had been present to- night to have
heard him and to have seen the impression  his song had made upon those gathered about him.

Kennedy Square! What would dear old Richard Horn, with his violin tucked lovingly under his
chin, and gentle, white-haired Nathan, with his lips caressing  his flute, have thought of
it all, as they listened to the uproar of Cockburn's coal-scuttle? And, that latter-day Chesterfield,
Colonel John Howard Clayton,  of Pongateague, whose pipe-stemmed Madeira glasses were kept
submerged in iced finger-bowls until the moment of their use, and whose rare Burgundies were
drunk out of ruby-colored soap-bubbles warmed to an exact temperature. What would this old
aristocrat have thought of McFudd's mixture and the way it was served?

No! It was just as well that Kennedy Square, at the moment of Oliver's triumph, was fast asleep.

CHAPTER IX

MISS TEETUM'S LONG TABLE

The prying sun peeped through the dingy curtains of Fred's bedroom on the morning after Oliver's
revels, stencilling a long slant of yellow light down its grimy walls, and awaking our young
hero with a start. Except for the shattered remnants of the basins and pitchers that he saw
as he looked around him, and the stringy towels, still wet, hanging over the backs of the chairs,
he would not have recognized  it as the same room in which he had met such brilliant company
the night before--so kindly a glamour does the night throw over our follies.

With the vision of the room and its tokens of their frolic came an uneasy sense of an unpleasant
remembrance. The thrill of his own triumph no longer filled his heart; only the memory of the
uproar  remained. As he caught sight of the broken pieces of china still littering the carpet,
and recalled McFudd's sprawling figure, a slight color suffused his cheek.

The room itself, in the light of day, was not only cold and uninviting, but so bare of even
the commonest  comforts that Oliver shivered. The bottoms were half out of the chairs; the
painted wash-stand stood on a square of chilly oil-cloth; the rusty grate and broken hearth
were unswept of their ashes; the carpet  patched and threadbare. He wondered, as he studied
each detail, how Miss Teetum could expect her boarders to be contented in such quarters.

He saw at a glance how much more cosey and restful  the room might be made with the addition
of a few touches here and there; a colored print or two-- a plaster cast--a bit of cheap stuff
or some gay-colored  cushions. It surprised him, above all, to discover  that Fred, who was
studying art and should, therefore, be sensitive to such influences, was willing to live amid
such desolate surroundings.

When he stepped out into the square hall, the scene of the night's revelry, and glanced about
him, the crude bareness and reckless disorder that the merciful  glow of the gas-light and
its attendant shadows had kindly concealed, stood out in bold relief under the white light
of the day now streaming through an oval skylight immediately above the piano. The floor was
strewn with the various properties of the night's performance--overturned stools, china mugs,
bits of lemon-peel, stumps of cigars, and stray pipes; while scattered about under the piano
and between the legs of the chairs, and even upon the steps of the staircase, were the pieces
of coal which Fog-horn Cranch and Waller, who held the scuttle, had pounded into bits when
they produced that wild jangle  which had added so much of dignity and power to the bass notes
of the Dead Man's Chorus.

These cold facts aroused in Oliver a sense of repugnance  which he could not shake off. It
was as if the head of some jolly clown of the night before had been suddenly thrust through
the canvas of the tent in broad daylight, showing the paint, the wrinkles beneath, the yellow
teeth, and the coarse mouth.

Oliver was about to turn back to Fred's room, this feeling of revolt strong upon him, when
his attention was arrested by a collection of drawings that covered almost every square inch
of the ceiling. To his  astonishment he discovered that what in the smoke of the night before
he had supposed to be only hasty sketches scrawled over the white plaster, were in reality,
now that he saw them in a clearer atmosphere,  effective pictures in pastel, oil, and charcoal.
That the basis of these cartoons was but the grimy stain made by the water which had beaten
through the rickety sash during the drive and thrash of winter storms, flooding the whitewashed
ceiling and trickling  down the side-walls in smears of brown rust, did not lessen their value
in his eyes.

Closer inspection showed him that these discolorations --some round or curved, others straight
or angular--had been altered and amended as the signatures  indicated by the deft pencils of
Waller, Fred, Bowdoin, and the others, into flying Cupids, Dianas, Neptunes, and mermaids fit
to grace the ceiling of a salon if properly enlarged; while the up-and-down smears had suggested
the opportunity for caricaturing  half the boarders of the house. Every fresh leak and its
accompanying stains evidently presented a new problem to the painters, and were made the subject
of prolonged study and much consultation before a brush was permitted to touch them, the point
apparently  being to help the discolorations express themselves  with the fewest possible touches.

In addition to these decorations overhead, Oliver found, framed in on the cleaner plaster of
the side- walls, between broad bands of black paint, several taking bits of landscape in color
and black and white; stretches of coast with quaint boats and dots of figures;  winter wood
interiors with white plaster for snow and scrapings of charcoal for tree-trunks, each one marked
with that sure crispness of touch which denotes the master-hand. Moreover, the panels of all
the doors, as well as their jambs and frames, were ornamented with sketches in all mediums,
illustrating  incidents in the lives of the various boarders who occupied the rooms below,
and who--so Fred told him afterward--stole into this sacred spot on the sly, to gloat over
the night's work whenever a new picture was reported and the rightful denizens were known to
be absent.

As he stood absorbed before these marvels of brush and pencil, scrutinizing each one in turn,
his sense of repulsion for the debris on the floor gave way to a feeling of enthusiasm. Not
only were the sketches far superior to any he had ever seen, but the way in which they were
done and the uses of the several mediums were a revelation to him. It was only when Fog-horn
Cranch's big voice roused him to consciousness that he realized where he was. The auctioneer
was coming out of his room, resplendent in a striped suit, gaiters, and white necktie--this
being  his real-estate day.

"My dear fellow," Cranch shouted, bringing his hand down on Oliver's shoulder, "do you know
you've got a voice like an angel's?"

Before Oliver could reply, My Lord Cockburn joined them, his first word one of pleasure at
meeting  him, and his second a hope that he would know him better; then Fred ran out, flinging
on his coat and laughing as he came. Under these combined influences of praise and good-cheer
Oliver's spirits rose and his blood began once more to surge through his veins. With his old-time
buoyancy he put his arm through Fred's, while the two tramped gayly down the four flights of
stairs to be ushered into the long, narrow, stuffy dining-room on the basement floor, there
to be presented to the two Misses Teetum, who as the young men entered bent low over their
plates in unison. This perfunctory salute our young gentleman  acknowledged by bowing grandly
in return, after which he dropped into a seat next to Fred's-- his back to a tin box filled
with plates, placed over the hot-air register--drew out a damp napkin from a bone ring, and
took a bird's-eye view of the table and its occupants.

The two Misses Teetum sat one at either end-- Miss Ann, thin, severe, precise; Miss Sarah,
stout, coy, and a trifle kittenish, as doubtless became a young woman of forty-seven, and her
sister's junior by eight years. Miss Ann had evidently passed the dead-line of middle age,
and had given up the fight, and was fast becoming a very prim and very proper old lady, but
Miss Sarah, being out of range, could still smile, and nod her head, and shake her curls, and
laugh little, hollow, girlish laughs, and otherwise  disport herself in a light and kittenish
way, after the manner of her day and age. All of which betrayed  not only her earnest desire
to please, but her increasing anxiety to get in under matrimonial cover before one of Father
Time's sharpshooters picked her off, and thus ended her youthful career.

The guests seated on either side of these two presiding  goddesses, Oliver was convinced, as
he studied the double row of faces, would have stretched the wondering eyelids of Kennedy Square
to their utmost limits.

Old Mr. Lang, who with his invalid wife occupied the room immediately below Fred's, and who
had been so nearly drowned out the night before because of McFudd's acrobatic tendencies, sat
on Fred's left. Properly clothed and in his right mind, he proved to be a most delightful old
gentleman, with gold spectacles  and snow-white side-whiskers, and a welcoming smile for everyone
who entered. Fred said that the smile never wavered even when the old gentleman had been up
all night with his wife.

Across the table, with her eye-glasses trained on Oliver, half concealed by a huge china "compoteer"
(to quote the waitress), and at present filled with last week's fruit, caulked with almonds,
sat Mrs. Southwark  Boggs--sole surviving relic of S. B., Esq. This misfortune she celebrated
by wearing his daguerreotype,  set in plain gold, as a brooch with which she fastened her crocheted
collar. She was a thin, faded, funereal-looking person, her body encased in a black silk dress,
which looked as if it had been pressed and ironed over night, and her hands in black silk mitts
which reached to her knuckles.

On Mrs. Boggs's right sat Bates--a rising young lawyer with political tendencies--one of the
first men to cut his hair so "Zou-Zou" that it stood straight up from his forehead; and next
to him Morgan, the editor, who pored over manuscript while his coffee got cold; and then Nelson,
and Webster, and Cummings  all graded in Miss Ann's mind as being eight, or ten, or twelve-dollar-a-week
men, depending on the rooms that they occupied, and farther along, toward  Miss Sarah, Cranch
and Cockburn--five-dollar boys these (Fred was another), with the privilege of lighting their
own coke fires, and of trimming the wicks and filling the bulbs of their own burning-fluid
lamps. And away down in the far corner, crumpled  up in his chair, crouched the cheery little
hunchback,  Mr. Crumbs, who kept a book-stall on Astor Place, where Bayard Taylor, Irving,
Halleck, Bryant, and many another member of the Century Club used to spend their late afternoons
delving among the old volumes on his shelves.

All these regular boarders, including Fog-horn Cranch and Fred, breakfasted at eight o'clock.
Waller, the painter, and Tomlins, the swell, breakfasted  at nine. As to that descendant of
the Irish kings, Mr. Cornelius McFudd, he rose at ten, or twelve, or two, just as the spirit
(and its dilutions of the night before) moved or retarded him, and breakfasted  whenever Miss
Ann or Miss Sarah, who had presided continuously at the coffee-urn from eight to ten, could
spare one of her two servants to carry a tray to his room.

Last and by no means least, with her eyes devouring  every expression that flitted across the
new arrival's  face, there beamed out beside Miss Ann, a tail, willowy young person, whom Fred,
in answer to an inquiring lifting of Oliver's eyebrows, designated as the belle of the house.
This engaging young woman really lived with her mother, in the next street, but flitted in
and out, dining, or breakfasting,  or spending a week at a time with her aunts, the Misses
Teetum, whenever an opportunity offered--the opportunity being a vacant and non- paying room,
one of which she was at the time enjoying.

This fair damsel, who was known to the boarders on the top floor as "our Phemy," and to the
world at large as Miss Euphemia Teetum--the real jewel in her name was Phoebe, but she had
reset it--had been especially beloved, so Fred informed Oliver, by every member of the club
except Waller, who, having lived in boarding-houses all his life, understood her thoroughly.
Her last flame--the fire was still smouldering --had been the immaculate Tomlins, who had won
her heart by going into raptures, in one of his stage whispers, over the classic outlines of
her face. This outburst resulted in Miss Euphemia appearing the following week in a silk gown,
a Greek fillet and no hoops--a costume which Waller faithfully portrayed  on the side-wall
of the attic the night of her appearance--the fillet being reproduced by a strip of brass which
the artist had torn from his easel and nailed to the plaster, and the classic curves of her
hair by a ripple of brown paint.

This caricature nearly provoked a riot before the night was over, the whole club, including
even the fun-loving McFudd, denouncing. Waller's act as an outrage. In fact, the Hibernian
himself had once been so completely taken off his feet--it was the first week of his stay--by
the winning ways of the young lady, that Miss Ann had begun to have high hopes of Euphemia's
being finally installed mistress in one of those shadowy estates which the distinguished Hibernian
described with such eloquence. That these hopes did not materialize was entirely due to Cockburn,
who took pains to enlighten the good woman upon the intangible character of the Hibernian's
possessions, thus saving the innocent maiden from the clutches of the bold, bad adventurer.
At least, that had been Cockburn's account of it when he came upstairs.

But it was at dinner that same night--for Oliver at Fred's pressing invitation had come back
to dinner --that the full galaxy of guests and regulars burst upon our hero. Then came not
only Miss Euphemia Teetum in a costume especially selected for Oliver's capture, but a person
still more startling and imposing --so imposing, in fact, that when she entered the room one-half
of the gentlemen present made little backward movements with the legs of their chairs, as if
intending to rise to their feet in honor of her presence.

This prominent figure in fashionable life, who had now settled herself on the right of Miss
Ann--the post of honor at the table--and who was smiling in so gracious and condescending a
manner as her eye lighted on the several recipients of her favor, was none other than the distinguished
Mrs. Schuyler Van Tassell, of Tarrytown, another bird of passage, who had left her country-seat
on the Hudson to spend the winter months in what she called the delights of  "upper-tandem."
She belonged to an ancient family--or, at least, her husband did--he was under the sod, poor
soul, and therefore at peace--and, having inherited his estate--a considerable one--was to
be treated with every distinction.

These several personages of low and high degree interested our young gentleman quite as much
as our young gentleman interested them. He made friends with them all--especially with the
ladies, who all agreed that he was a most charming and accomplished  youth. This good opinion
became permanent when Oliver had paid each in turn the compliment of rising from his seat when
any one of them entered the room, as much a habit with the young fellow as the taking off of
his hat when he came into a house, but which was so rare a courtesy at Miss Teetum's that each
recipient appropriated the compliment as personal to herself.

These sentiments of admiration were shared, and to an alarming degree, by Miss Euphemia herself,
who, on learning later that Oliver had decided to occupy half of Fred's room through the winter,
had at once determined to remain during the week, the better to lay siege to his heart. This
resolution,  it is fair to Oliver to say, she abandoned before dinner was over, when her experienced
eye detected a certain amused if not derisive smile playing around the corners of Oliver's
mouth; a discovery which so impressed the young woman that she left him severely  alone ever after.

And so it was that Oliver unpacked his trunk--the same old hair trunk, studded with brass nails,
that had held his father's wardrobe at college--spread out and tacked up the various knick-knacks
which his mother and Sue and Miss Clendenning had given him when he had left the old home,
and began to make himself comfortable on the top floor of Miss Teetum's boarding-house on Union
Square.

CHAPTER X

MCFUDD'S BRASS BAND

Our hero had been installed at Miss Teetum's for a month or more, when one night at dinner
a tiny envelope about the size of a visiting-card was brought in by the middle-aged waitress
and laid beside Simmons's  plate. The envelope contained six orchestra seats at the Winter
Garden and was accompanied by a note which read as follows: "Bring some of the boys; the piece
drags."

The musician studied the note carefully and a broad smile broke over his face. As one of the
first violins at the Winter Garden, with a wide acquaintance  among desirable patrons of the
theatre, he had peculiar facilities for obtaining free private boxes and orchestra chairs not
only at his own theatre, but often at Wallack's in Broome Street and the old Bowery.  Simmons
was almost always sure to have tickets when the new piece needed booming, or when an old play
failed to amuse and the audiences had begun to shrink. Indeed, the mystery of Mrs. Schuyler
Van Tassell's frequent appearance in the left-hand proscenium box at the Winter Garden on Friday
nights--a mystery unexplained among the immediate friends in Tarrytown, who knew how she husbanded
her resources despite her accredited wealth--was no mystery at all to the guests at Miss Teetum's
table, who were in the habit of seeing just such tiny envelopes handed to Simmons during soup,
and duly passed by him to that distinguished leader of society. Should more than two tickets
be enclosed, Mrs. Van T. would, perhaps, invite. Mr. Ruffle-shirt Tomlins, or some other properly
attired person, to accompany her--never Miss Ann or the little hunchback, who dearly loved
the play, but who could seldom afford to go--never anybody, in fact, who wore plain clothes
or looked a compromising acquaintance.

On this night, however, Pussy Me-ow Simmons, ignoring Mrs. Van Tassell, turned to Oliver.

"Ollie," he whispered--the formalities had ceased between the members of the Skylarks--"got
anything  to do to-night?"

"No; why?"

And then, Simmons, with various imaginary poundings of imaginary canes on the threadbare carpet
beneath his chair, and with sundry half-smothered  bursts of real laughter in which Fred and
Oliver joined, unfolded his programme for the evening--a programme which was agreed to so rapturously
that the trio before dinner was over excused themselves to their immediate neighbors and bounded
upstairs, three steps at a time. There they pulled the Walrus out of his bed and woke up McFudd,
who had gone to sleep before dinner, and whom nobody had called. Then having sent my Lord Cockburn
to find Ruffle- shirt Tomlins, who by this time was paying court to Miss Euphemia in the front
parlor, and having pinned a ticket to Mr. Fog-horn Cranch's door, with instructions  to meet
them in the lobby the moment he returned,  they all slipped on their overcoats, picked up their
canes, and started for the theatre.

Six young fellows, all with red blood in their veins, steel springs under their toes and laughter
in their hearts! Six comrades, pals, good-fellows, skipping down the avenue as gay as colts
and happy as boys-- no thought for to-day and no care for to-morrow! Each man with a free ticket
in his pocket and a show ahead of him. No wonder the bluecoats looked after them and smiled;
no wonder the old fellow with the shaky legs, waiting at the corner for one of the squad to
help him over, gave a sigh as he watched McFudd, with cane in air, drilling his recruits, all
five abreast. No wonder the tired shop-girls glanced at them enviously as they swung into Broadway
chanting  the "Dead Man's Chorus," with Oliver's voice sounding clear as a bell above the din
of the streets.

The play was a melodrama of the old, old school. There was a young heroine in white, and a
handsome lover in top-boots and white trousers, and a cruel uncle who wanted her property.
And there was a particularly brutal villain with leery eyes, ugly mouth, with one tooth gone,
and an iron jaw like a hull-dog's. He was attired in a fur cap, brown corduroy  jacket, with
a blood-red handkerchief twisted about his throat, and he carried a bludgeon. When the double-dyed
villain proceeded in the third act to pound the head of the lovely maiden to a jelly at the
instigation of the base uncle, concealed behind a painted tree-trunk, and the lover rushed
in and tried to save her, every pair of hands except Oliver's came together in raptures of
applause, assisted by a vigorous  hammering of canes on the floor.

"Pound away, Ollie," whispered Simmons; "that's what we came for; you are spoiling all our
fun. The manager is watching us. Pound away, I tell you. There he is inside that box."

"I won't," said Oliver, in a tone of voice strangely in contrast with the joyousness of an
hour before.

"Then you won't get any more free tickets," muttered Simmons in surprise.

"I don't want them. I don't believe in murdering people on the stage, or anywhere else. That
man's face is horrible; I'm sorry I came."

Simmons laughed, and, shielding his mouth with his hand, repeated Oliver's outburst to Waller,
who, having first sent news of it down the line, reached over and shook Oliver's hand gravely,
while he wiped a theatrical tear from his eye; while my Lord Cockburn,  with feet and hands
still busy, returned word to Oliver by Tomlins, "not to make a colossal ass of himself." Oliver
bore their ridicule good-naturedly, but without receding from his opinion in any way, a fact
which ultimately raised him in the estimation of the group. Only when the villain was thrown
over the pasteboard cliff into a canvas sea by the gentleman  in top-boots, to be devoured
by sharks or cut up by pirates, or otherwise disposed of as befitted so blood-thirsty and cruel
a monster, did Oliver join in the applause.

The play over, and Simmons having duly reported to the manager--who was delighted with the
activity of the feet, but who advised that next time the sticks be left at home--the happy
party sailed up Broadway,  this time by threes and twos, swinging their canes as before, and
threading their way in and out of the throngs that filled the street.

The first stop was made at the corner of Thirteenth Street by McFudd, who turned his troop
abruptly to the right and marched them down a flight of steps into a cellar, where they immediately
attacked a huge wash-tub filled with steamed clams, and covered with a white cloth to keep
them hot. This was the bar's free lunch. The clams devoured--six each--and the necessary beers
paid for, the whole party started to retrace their steps, when Simmons stopped to welcome 
a new-corner who had entered the cellar unperceived  by the barkeeper, and who was bending
over the wash-tub of clams, engaged in picking out the smallest of the bivalves with the end
of all iron fork. He had such a benevolent, kindly face, and was so courtly in his bearing,
and spoke with so soft and gentle a voice, that Oliver, who stood next to Simmons, lingered
to listen.

"Oh, my dear Simmons," cried the old gentleman, "we missed you to-night. When are you coming
back to us? The orchestra is really getting to be  deplorable. Miss Gannon quite broke down
in her song. We must protest, my boy; we must protest. I saw you in front, but you should be
wielding the baton. And is this young gentleman one of your friends?"

"Yes--Mr. Horn. Ollie, let me introduce you to Mr. Gilbert, the actor"--and he laid his hand
on Oliver's shoulder--"dear John Gilbert, as we always call him."

Oliver looked up into the kindly, sweet face of the man, and a curious sensation passed over
him. Could this courtly, perfectly well-bred old gentleman, with his silver-white hair, beaming
smile and gentle voice, the equal of any of his father's guests, be an actor? Could he possibly
belong to the profession which, of all others, Oliver had been taught to despise? The astonishment
of our young hero was so great that for a moment he could not speak.

Simmons thought he read Oliver's mind, and came to his rescue.

"My friend, Mr. Horn, did not like the play to- night, Mr. Gilbert," he said. "He thinks the
death-scene was horrible"--and Simmons glanced smiling at the others who stood at a little
distance watching the interview with great interest.

"Dear me, dear me, you don't say so. What was it you objected to, may I ask?" There was a trace
of anxiety in his voice.

"Why, the murder-scene, sir. It seemed to me too dreadful to kill a woman in that way. I haven't
forgotten it yet," and a distressed look passed over Oliver's face. "But then I have seen but
very few plays," he added--"none like that."

The old actor looked at him with a relieved expression.

"Ah, yes, I see. Yes, you're indeed right. As you say, it is quite a dreadful scene."

"Oh, then you've seen it yourself, sir," said Oliver, in a relieved tone.

The old actor's eyes twinkled. He, too, had read the young man's mind--not a difficult task
when one looked down into Oliver's eyes.

"Oh, many, many times," he answered with a smile. "I have known it for years. In the old days,
when they would smash the poor lady's head, they used to have a pan of gravel which they would
crunch with a stick to imitate the breaking of the. bones. It was quite realistic from the
front, but that was given up long ago. How did YOU like the business  to-night, Mr. Simmons?"
and he turned to the musician.

"Oh, admirable, sir. We all thought it had never been better played or better put on," and
he glanced again toward his companions, who stood apart, listening  breathlessly to every word
that fell from the actor's lips.

"Ah, I am glad of it. Brougham will be so pleased --and yet it shocked you, Mr. Horn--and you
really think the poor lady minded it? Dear me! How pleased she will be when I tell her the
impression it all made upon you. She's worked so hard over the part and has been so nervous
about it. I left her only a moment ago--she and her husband wanted me to take supper with them
at Riley's--the new restaurant  on University Place, you know, famous for its devilled crabs.
But I always like to come here for my clams. Allow me a moment--" and he bent over the steaming
tub, and skewering the contents of a pair of shells with his iron fork held it out toward Oliver.

"Let me beg of you, Mr. Horn, to taste this clam. I am quite sure it is a particularly savory
one. After this my dear young friend, I hope you'll have a better  opinion of me." And his
eye twinkled. "I am really better than I look--indeed I am--and so, my dear boy, is this clam.
Come, come, it is getting cold."

"What do you mean by 'a better opinion' of you, Mr. Gilbert?" stammered Oliver. He had been
completely  captivated by the charm of the actor's manner. "Why shouldn't I think well of you?--I
don't understand."

"Why--because I strangled the poor lady to- night. You know, of course--that it was I who played
the villain."

"You!" exclaimed Oliver. "No, I did not, sir. Why, Mr. Gilbert, I can't realize--oh, I hope
you'll forgive me for what I've said. I've only been in New York a short time, and--"

The old gentleman cut short Oliver's explanation with a wave of his fork, and looking down
into the boy's face, said in a serious tone:

"My son, you're quite right. Quite right--and I like you all the better for it. All such plays
are dreadful I feel just as you do about them, but what can we actors do? The public will have
it that way."

Another little prejudice toppled from its pedestal, another household tradition of Oliver's
smashed into a thousand pieces at his feet! This rubbing and grinding process of man against
man; this seeing with one's own eyes and not another's was fast rounding out and perfecting
the impressionable clay of our young gentleman's mind. It was a lesson, too, the scribe is
delighted to say, which our hero never forgot;  nor did he ever forget the man who taught it.
One of his greatest delights in after-years was to raise his hat to this incomparable embodiment
of the dignity  and courtliness of the old school. The old gentleman  had long since forgotten
the young fellow, but that made no difference to Oliver--he would cross the street any time
to lift his hat to dear John Gilbert.

The introduction of the other members of the club to the villain being over--they had stood
the whole time, they were listening to the actor, each head  uncovered--McFudd again marshalled
his troop and proceeded up Broadway, where, at Oliver's request, they were halted at the pedestal
of the big Bronze Horse and within sight of their own quarters.

Here McFudd insisted that the club should sing "God Save the Queen" to the Father of his Country,
where he sat astride of his horse, which was accordingly  done, much to the delight of a couple
of night- watchmen, who watched the entire performance and who, upon McFudd's subsequent inspection,
proved to be fellow-countrymen of the distinguished Hibernian.

Had the buoyant and irrepressible Irishman been content with this patriotic outburst as the
final winding- up of the night's outing, and had he then and there betaken himself and his
fellows off to bed, the calamity which followed, and which so nearly wrecked the Skylarks,
might have been avoided.

It is difficult at any time to account for the workings  of Fate or to follow the course of
its agents. The track of an earth-worm destroys a dam; the parting of a wire wrecks a bridge;
the breaking of a root starts an avalanche; the flaw in an axle dooms a train; the sting of
a microbe depopulates a city. But none of these unseen, mysterious agencies was at work--nothing
so trivial wrecked the Skylarks.

It was a German street-band!

A band whose several members had watched McFudd and his party from across the street, and who
had begun limbering their instruments before the sextet had ceased singing; regarding the situation,
no doubt, as pregnant with tips.

McFudd did not give the cornet time to draw his instrument from its woollen bag before he had
him by the arm.

"Don't put a mouthful of wind into that horn of yours until I spake to ye," he cried in vociferous
tones.

The leader stopped and looked at him in a dazed way.

"I have an idea, gentlemen," added McFudd, turning to his companion's, and tapping his forehead.
"I am of the opinion that this music would be wasted on the night air, and so with your parmission
I propose  to transfer this orchestra to the top flure, where we can listen to their chunes
at our leisure. Right about, face! Forward! March!" and McFudd advanced upon the band, wheeled
the drum around, and, locking arms with the cornet, started across the street for the stone steps.

"Not a word out of any o' ye till I get 'em in," McFudd continued in a low voice, fumbling
in his pocket for his night-key.

The musicians obeyed mechanically and tiptoed one by one inside the dimly lighted hall, followed
by Oliver and the others.

"Now take off your shoes; you've four flights of stairs to crawl up, and if ye make a noise
until I'm ready for ye, off goes a dollar of your pay."

The bass-drum carefully backed his instrument against the wall, sat down on the floor, and
began pulling off his boots; the cornet and bassoon followed; the clarionet wore only his gum
shoes, and so was  permitted to keep them on.

"Now, Walley, me boy, do you go ahead and turn up the gas and open the piano, and Cockburn,
old man, will ye kindly get the blower and tongs out of Freddie's room and the scuttle out
of Tomlins's closet and the Chinese gong that hangs over me bed? And all you fellers go ahead
treading on whispers, d'ye moind?" said McFudd under his breath. "I'll bring up this gang with
me. Not a breath out of any o' yez remimber, till I get there. The drum's unhandy and we got
to go slow wid it," and he slipped the strap over his head and started upstairs, followed by
the band.

The ascent was made without a sound until old Mr. Lang's door was reached, when McFudd's foot
slipped, and, but for the bassoonist's head, both the Irishman and the drum would have rolled
down- stairs. Lang heard the sound, and recognizing the character of the attendant imprecation,
did not get up. "It's only McFndd," he said quietly to his suddenly  awakened wife.

Once safe upon the attic floor the band who were entering with great gusto into the spirit
of the occasion,  arranged themselves in a half-circle about the piano, replaced their shoes,
stripped their instruments of their coverings--the cornetist breathing noiselessly  into the
mouth-pieces to thaw out the frost--and stood at attention for McFudd's orders.

By this time Simmons had taken his seat at the piano; Cockburn held the blower and tongs; Cranch,
who on coming in had ignored the card tacked to his door, and who was found fast asleep in
his chair, was given the coal-scuttle; and little Tomlins grasped his own wash-basin in one
hand and Fred's poker in the other. Oliver was to sing the air, and Fred was to beat a tattoo
on Waller's door with the butt end of a cane. The gas had been turned up and every kerosene
lamp had been lighted and ranged about the hall. McFudd threw off his coat and vest, cocked
a Scotch smoking- cap over one eye, and seizing the Chinese gong in one hand and the wooden
mallet in the other, climbed upon the piano and faced his motley orchestra.

"Attintion, gentlemen," whispered McFudd.

"The first chune will be 'Old Dog Tray,' because it begins wid a lovely howl. Remimber now,
when I hit this gong that's the signal for yez to begin, and ye'll all come together wid wan
smash. Then the band will play a bar or two, and then every man Jack o' ye will go strong on
the chorus. Are yez ready?"

McFudd swung his mallet over his head; poised it for an instant; ran his eye around the circle
with the air of an impresario; saw that the drum was in position,  the horns and clarionet
ready, the blower, scuttle,  tongs, and other instruments of torture in place, and hit the
gong with all his might.

The crash that followed woke every boarder in the house and tumbled half of them out of their
beds. Long before the chorus had been reached all the doors had been thrown open, and the halls
and passageways  filled with the startled boarders. Then certain  mysterious-looking figures
in bed-gowns, water- proofs, and bath-robes began bounding up the stairs, and a collection
of dishevelled heads were thrust through the door of the attic. Some of the suddenly  awakened
boarders tried to stop the din by protest; others threatened violence; one or two grinned with
delight. Among these last was the little hunchback, swathed in a blanket like an Indian chief,
and barefooted.  He had rushed upstairs at the first sound as fast as his little legs could
carry him, and was peering  under the arms of the others, rubbing his sides with glee and laughing
like a boy. Mrs. Schuyler Van Tassell, whose head and complexion were not ready for general
inspection, had kept her door partly closed, opening it only wide enough when the other boarders
rushed by to let her voice through--always an unpleasant organ when that lady had lost her temper.

As the face of each new arrival appeared in the doorway, McFudd would bow gracefully in recognition
of the honor of its presence, and redouble his attack on the gong. The noise he produced was
only equalled by that of the drum, which never ceased for an instant--McFudd's orders being
to keep that instrument  going irrespective of time or tune.

In the midst of this uproar of brass, strings, sheep- skin, wash-bowls, broken coal, pokers
and tongs, a lean figure in curl-papers and slippers, bright red calico wrapper reaching to
the floor, and a lighted candle in one hand, forced its way through the crowd at the door and
stood out in the glare of the gaslights facing McFudd.

It was Miss Ann Teetum!

Instantly a silence fell upon the room.

"Gentlemen, this is outrageous!" she cried in a voice that ripped through the air like a saw.
"I have put up with these disgraceful performances as long as I am going to. Not one of you
shall stay in my house another night. Out you go in the morning, every one of you, bag and
baggage!"

McFudd attempted to make an apology. Oliver stepped forward, the color mounting to his cheeks,
and Waller began a protest at the unwarrantable intrusion, but the infuriated little woman
waved them all aside and turning abruptly marched back through the door and down the staircase,
preceded by the other female boarders. The little hunchback alone remained. He was doubled
up in a knot, wiping  the tears from his eyes, his breath gone from excessive  laughter.

The Skylarkers looked at each other in blank astonishment.  One of the long-cherished traditions
of the house was the inviolability of this attic. Its rooms were let with an especial privilege
guaranteeing  its privacy, with free license to make all the noise possible, provided the racket
was confined to that one floor. So careful had been its occupants to observe this rule, that
noisy as they all were when once on the top floor, every man unlocked the front door at night
with the touch of a burglar and crept upstairs as noiselessly as a footpad.

"I'm sorry, men," said McFudd, looking into the astounded faces about him. "I'm the last man,
as ye know, to hurt anybody's feelings. But what the divil's got into the old lady? Who'd 'a'
thought she would have heard a word of it down where she sleeps in the basement?"

"'Tis the Van Tassell," grunted the Walrus. "She's so mesmerized the old woman lately that
she don't know her own mind."

"What makes you think she put her up to it, Waller?" asked Cranch.

"I don't think--but it's just like her," answered Waller, with illogical prejudice.

"My eye! wasn't she a beauty!" laughed Fred, and he picked up a bit of charcoal and began an
outline  of the wrapper and slippers on the side-wall.

Tomlins, Cranch, and the others had no suggestions  to offer. Their minds were too much occupied
in wondering what was going to become of them in the morning.

The German band by this time had regained their usual solidity. The leader seemed immensely
relieved.  He had evidently expected the next apparition  to be a bluecoat with a pair of handcuffs.

"Put their green jackets on 'em," McFudd said to the leader quietly, pointing to the instruments.
"We're much obliged to you and your men for coming up," and he slipped some notes into the
leader's hand. "Now get downstairs, every man o' ye, as aisy as if ye were walking on eggs.
Cranch, old man, will ye see 'em out, to kape that infernal drum from butting into the Van
Tassell's door, or we'll have another hornet's nest. Begorra, there's wan thing very sure--it's
little baggage I'LL have to move out."

The next morning a row of six vacant seats stared Miss Ann out of countenance. The outcasts
had risen early and had gone to Riley's for their breakfast. Miss Ann sat at the coffee-urn
as stiff and erect as an avenging judge. Lofty purpose and grim determination  were written
in every line of her face. Mrs. Van Tassell was not in evidence. Her nerves had been so shattered
by the "night's orgy," she had said to Miss Ann, that she should breakfast in her room. She
further notified Miss Teetum that she should at once withdraw her protecting presence from
the  establishment, and leave it without a distinguished social head, if the dwellers on the
top floor remained another day under the same roof with herself.

An ominous silence and depressing gloom seemed. to hang over everybody. Several of the older
men pushed back their plates and began drumming oh the table-cloth with their fingers, a far-away
look in their eyes. One or two talked in whispers, their coffee untasted.  Old Mr. Lang looked
down the line of empty seats and took his place with a dejected air. He was the oldest man
in the house and the oldest boarder; this gave him certain privileges, one being to speak his mind.

"I understand," he said, unfolding his napkin and facing. Miss Ann, "that you have ordered
the boys out of the house?"

"Yes, I have," snapped out Miss Teetum.

Everybody looked up. No one recognized the tone of her voice, it was so sharp and bitter.

"Why, may I ask?"

"I will not have my house turned into a bear- garden, that's why!"

"That's better than a graveyard," retorted Mr. Lang. "That's what the house would be without
them. I can't understand why you object. You sleep in the basement and shouldn't hear a sound;
my wife and I sleep under them every night. If we can stand it, you can. You send the boys
away, Miss Teetum, and we'll move out."

Miss Ann winced under the shot, but she did not answer.

"Do you mean that you're going to turn the young gentlemen into the street, Miss Ann?" whined
Mrs. Southwark Boggs in an injured tone, from her end of the table. "Are we going to have no
young life in the house at all? I won't stay a day after they're gone."

Miss Teetum changed color, but she looked straight ahead of her. She evidently did not want
her private affairs discussed at the table.

"I shall want my bill at the end of the week, now that the boys are to leave," remarked the
little hunchback to Miss Ann as he bent over her chair. "Life is dreary enough as it is."

And so the boys stayed on.

Only one room became vacant at the end of the month. That was Mrs. Schuyler Van Tassell's.

CHAPTER XI

A CHANGE OF WIND

The affair of the brass band, with its dramatic and most unlooked-for ending, left an unpleasant
memory in the minds of the members of the club, especially in Oliver's. His training had been
somewhat different  from that of the others present, and his oversensitive  nature had been
more shocked than pleased by it all. While most of the other participants regretted  the ill-feeling
which had been aroused in Miss Teetum's mind, they felt sure--in fact, they knew-- that this
heretofore kind and gentle hostess could never have fanned her wrath to so white a heat had
not some other hand besides her own worked the bellows.

Suspicion first fell upon a new boarder unaccustomed  to the ways of the house, who, it was
reported, had double-locked herself in at the first crash of the drum, and who had admitted,
on being cross-examined  by McFudd, that she had nearly broken her back in trying to barricade
her bedroom door with a Saratoga trunk and a wash-stand. This theory was abandoned when subsequent
inquiries brought to light the fact that Mrs. Van Tassell, when the echoes of one of McFudd's
songs had reached her ears, had stated a week before that no respectable boarding-house would
tolerate uproars like those which took place almost nightly on the top floor, and that she
would withdraw her protection from Miss Euphemia and leave the house at once and forever if
the noise did not cease. This dire threat being duly reported to the two Misses Teetum had--it
was afterward  learned--so affected them both that Miss Ann had gone to bed with a chill and
Miss Sarah had warded off another with a bowl of hot camomile tea.

This story, true as it undoubtedly was, did not entirely clear up the situation. One part of
it sorely puzzled McFudd. Why did Miss Euphemia need Mrs. Van Tassell's protection, and why
should the loss of it stir Miss Ann to so violent an outburst? This question no member of the
Skylarks could answer.

The solution came that very night, and in the most unexpected way, Waller bearing the glad tidings.

Miss Euphemia, ignoring them all, was to be married  at St. Mark's at 6 P.M. on the following
Monday, and Mrs. Van Tassell was to take charge of the wedding  reception in the front parlor!
The groom was the strange young man who had sat for some days beside Miss Euphemia, passing
as Miss Ann's nephew, and who really was a well-to-do druggist with a shop on Astor Place.
All of the regular boarders of the house were to be invited.

The explosion of this matrimonial bomb so cleared the air of all doubt as to the guilt of Mrs.
Van Tassell, that a secret meeting, attended by every member of the Skylarks, was at once held
in Waller's room with the result that Miss Ann's invitations to the wedding were unanimously
accepted. Not only would the resident members go--so the original resolution ran --but the
non-resident and outside members would also be on hand to do honor to Miss Euphemia and her
distinguished chaperone. This amendment being accepted, McFudd announced in a sepulchral tone
that, owing to the severity of the calamity and to the peculiarly painful circumstances which
surrounded their esteemed fellow-skylarker, the Honorable Sylvester  Ruffle-shirt Tomlins,
his fellow-members would wear crape on their left arms for thirty days. This also was carried
unanimously, every man except Ruffle-shirt Tomlins breaking out into the "Dead Man's Chorus"--a
song, McFudd explained, admirably  fitted to the occasion.

When the auspicious night arrived, the several dress-suits of the members were duly laid out
on the piano and hung over the chairs, and each gentleman proceeded to array himself in costume
befitting the occasion. Waller, who weighed 200 pounds, squeezed himself into McFudd's coat
and trousers (McFudd weighed 150), the trousers reaching a little below the painter's knees.
McFudd wrapped Waller's coat about his thin girth and turned up the bagging legs, of the unmentionables
six inches above his shoes. The assorted costumes of the other members were equally grotesque.
The habiliments themselves were of proper cut and make, according to the standards of the time--spike-tailed
coats, white ties, patent- leather pumps, and the customary trimmings, but the effects produced
were as ludicrous as they were incongruous, though the studied bearing of the gentlemen  was
meant to prove their unconsciousness of the fact.

The astonishment that rested on Mrs. Van Tassell's  face when this motley group filed into
the parlor and with marked and punctilious deference paid their respects to the bride, and
the wrath that flashed in Miss Euphemia's eyes, became ever after part of the traditions of
the club. Despite Mrs. Van Tassell's protest against the uproar on the top floor, she had invariably
spoken in high terms to her friends and intimates of these very boarders--their acquaintance
was really part of her social capital--commenting at the same time upon their exalted social
and artistic positions. In fact, many of her own special guests had attended the wedding solely
in the hope of being brought into more intimate relations with this  distinguished group of
painters, editors, and musicians, some of whom were already being talked about.

When, however, McFudd stood in the corner of Miss Teetum's parlor like a half-scared boy, pulling
out the fingers of Waller's kid gloves, an inch too long for him, and Waller, Fred, and my
Lord Cockburn  stumbled over the hearth-rug one after the other, and Oliver, feeling like a
guilty man and a boor, bowed and scraped like a dancing-master; and Bowdoin the painter, and
Simmons and Fog-horn Cranch, talked platitudes with faces as grave as  undertakers, the expectant
special guests invited by Mrs. Van Tassell began to look upon her encomiums  as part of an
advertising scheme to fill Miss Teetum's rooms.

The impression made upon the Teetum contingent by the appearance and manners of the several
members --even Oliver's reputation was ruined--was equally disastrous. It was, perhaps, best
voiced by the druggist groom, when he informed Mrs. Van T. from behind his lemon-colored glove--that
"if that was the gang he had heard so much of, he didn't want no more of 'em."

But these and other jollifications were not long to continue. Causes infinitely more serious
were at work undermining the foundations of the Skylarks. The Lodge of Poverty, to which they
all belonged, gay as it had often been, was slowly closing its door; the unexpected, which
always hangs over life, was about to happen; the tie which bound these men together  was slowly
loosening. Its members might give the grip of fellowship to other members in other lodges over
the globe, but no longer in this one on the top floor of the house on Union Square.

One morning McFudd broke the seal of an important- looking letter bearing a Dublin post-mark
on the upper right-hand corner of the envelope, and the family crest on its flap. For some
moments he sat still, looking straight before him. Then two tears stole out and glistened on
his lashes.

"Boys," he said, slowly, "the governor says I must come home," and he held up a steamer ticket
and a draft that barely equalled his dues for a month's board and washing.

That night he pawned his new white overcoat with the bone buttons and velvet collar--the one
his father had sent him, and which had been the envy of every man in the club, and invested
every penny of the proceeds in a supper to be given to the Skylarks. The invitation ran as follows:

Mr. Cornelius McFudd respectively requests the pleasure of your presence at an informal wake
to be held in honor of a double-breasted overcoat, London cut. The body and tail will be the
ducks, and the two sleeves and velvet  collar the Burgundy.

Riley's: 8 p.m. Third floor back.

The following week he packed his two tin boxes, boarded the Scotia, and sailed for home.

The keystone having dropped out, it was not long before the balance of the structure came down
about the ears of the members. My Lord Cockburn the following  week was ordered South by the
bank to look after some securities locked up in a vault in a Georgia trust company, and which
required a special messenger  to recover them--the growing uneasiness in mercantile circles
over the political outlook of the country having assumed a serious aspect. Cockburn  had to
swim rivers, he wrote Oliver in his first letter, and cross mountains on horseback, and sleep
in a negro hut, besides having a variety of other  experiences, to say nothing of several hair-breadth
escapes, none of which availed him, as he returned home after all, without the bonds.

These financial straws, indicating the direction and force of the coming political winds, began
to accumulate.  The lull before the hurricane--the stagnation  in commercial circles--became
so ominous that soon the outside members and guests of the club ceased coming, being diligently
occupied in earning their bread, and then Simmons sent the piano home --it had been loaned
to him by reason of his profession  and position--and only Fog-horn Cranch, Waller,  Fred,
Oliver, and Ruffle-shirt Tomlins were left. Alter a while, Waller gave up his room and slept
in his studio and got his meals at the St. Clair, or went without them, so light, by reason
of the hard times, was the demand for sheep pictures of Waller's particular  make. And later
on Tomlins went abroad, and Cranch moved West. And so the ruin of the club was complete; and
so, too, this merry band of roysterers, with one or two exceptions, passes out of those pages.

Dear boys of the long ago, what has become of you all since those old days in that garret-room
on Union Square? Tomlins, I know, turned up in Australia, where he married a very rich and
very lovely woman, because he distinctly stated both of those facts in an exuberant letter
to Oliver when he invited him to the wedding. "Not a bad journey--only a step, my dear Ollie,
and we shall be so delighted to see you." I know this, to be true, for Oliver showed me the
letter.  Bowdoin went to Paris, where, as we all remember,  he had a swell studio opening on
to a garden, somewhere near the Arc de Triomphe, and had carriages  stop at his door, and a
butler to open it, and two maids in white caps to help the ladies off with their wraps. Poor
Cranch died in Montana while hunting for gold, and my Lord Cockburn went back to London.

But does anybody know what has become of McFudd--irresistible, irresponsible, altogether delightful
McFudd? that condensation of all that was joyous, rollicking, and spontaneous; that devotee
of the tub and pink of neatness, immaculate, clean- shaven and well-groomed; that soul of good-nature,
which no number of flowing bowls could disturb nor succeeding headaches dull; that most generous
of souls, whose first impulse was to cut squarely in half everything he owned and give you
your choice of the pieces, and who never lost his temper until you refused  them both. If you,
my dear boy, are still wandering  about this earth, and your eye should happen to fall on these
pages, remember, I send you my greeting.  If you have been sent for, and have gone aloft to
cheer those others who have gone before, and who could spare you no longer, speak a good word
for me, please, and then, perhaps, I may shake your hand again.

With the dissolution of the happy coterie there came to Oliver many a lonely night under the
cheap lamp, the desolate hall outside looking all the more desolate and uninviting with the
piano gone and the lights extinguished.

Yet these nights were not altogether distasteful to Oliver. Fred had noticed for months that
his room-mate no longer entered into the frolics of the club with the zest and vim that characterized
the earlier days of the young Southerner's sojourn among them. Our hero had said nothing while
the men had held together, and to all outward appearances  had done his share not only with
his singing,  but in any other way in which he could help on the merriment. He had covered
the space allotted  to him on the walls with caricatures of the several boarders below. He
had mixed the salad at Riley's the night of McFudd's farewell supper, with his sleeves rolled
up to the elbows and the cook's cap on his head. He had lined up with the others at Brown's
on the Bowery; drank his "crystal cocktails" --the mildest of beverages--and had solemnly marched
out again with his comrades in a lock-step like a gang of convicts. He had indulged in forty-
cent opera, leaning over the iron railing of the top row of the Academy of Music, and had finished
the evening at Pfaff's, drinking beer and munching hardtack  and pickles, and had laughed and
sung in a dozen other equally absurd escapades. And yet it was as plain as daylight to Fred
that Oliver's heart was no longer centred in the life about him.

The fact is, the scribe is compelled to admit, the life indulged in by these merry bohemians
had begun to pall upon this most sensitive of young gentlemen. It really had not satisfied
him at all. This was not the sort of life that Mr. Crocker meant, he had said to himself after
a night at Riley's when Cranch had sounded his horn so loud that the proprietor had threatened
to turn the whole party into the street. Mr. Crocker's temperament was too restful to be interested
in such performances. As for himself, he was tired of it.

Nothing of all this did he keep from his mother. The record of his likes and dislikes which
formed the subject-matter of his daily letters was an absorbing study with her, and she let
no variation of the weather-vane of his tastes escape her. Nor did she keep their contents
from her intimate friends. She had read to Colonel Clayton one of his earlier ones, in which
he had told her of the concerts and of the way Cockburn had served the brew that McFudd had
concocted, and had shown him an illustration Oliver had drawn on the margin of the sheet--an
outline of the china mug that held the mixture--to which that Chesterfield of a Clayton had
replied:

"What did I tell you, madame--just what I expected  of those Yankees--punch from mugs! Bah!"

She had, too, talked their contents over with Amos Cobb, who, since the confidence reposed
in him by the Horn family, had become a frequent visitor  at the house.

"There's no harm come to him yet, madame, or he wouldn't write you of what he does. Boys will
be boys. Let him have his fling," the Vermonter had replied with a gleam of pleasure in his
eye. "If he has the stuff in him that I think he has, he will swim out and get to higher ground;
if he hasn't, better let him drown early. It will give everybody less trouble."

The dear lady had lost no sleep over these escapades.  She, too, realized that as long as Oliver
poured out his heart unreservedly to her there was little to fear. In her efforts to cheer
him she had sought, in her almost daily letters sent him in return, to lead his thoughts into
other channels. She knew how fond he had always been of the society of women,  and how necessary
they were to his happiness, and she begged him to go out more. "Surely there must be some young
girls in so great a city who can help to make your life happier," she wrote.

In accordance with her suggestions, he had at last put on his best clothes and had accompanied
Tomlins and Fred to some very delightful houses away up in Thirty-third Street, and another
on Washington Square, and still another near St. Mark's Place, where his personality and his
sweet, sympathetic voice had gained him friends and most pressing invitations to call again.
Some he had accepted, and some he had not--it depended very largely on his mood and upon the
people whom he met. If they reminded him in any way, either in manners or appointments, of
his life at home, he went again--if not, he generally stayed away.

Among these was the house of his employer, Mr. Slade, who had treated him with marked kindness,
not only inviting him to his own house, but introducing  him to many of his friends--an unusual
civility Oliver discovered afterward--not many of the clerks being given a seat at Mr. Slade's
table. "I like his brusque, hearty manner," Oliver wrote to his mother after the first visit.
"His wife is a charming woman, and so are the two daughters, quite independent and fearless,
and entirely different from the girls at home, but most interesting and so well bred."

Another incident, too, had greatly pleased not only Oliver and his mother, but Richard as well.
It happened  that a consignment of goods belonging to Morton,  Slade & Co. was stored in a
warehouse in Charleston,  and it became necessary to send one of the clerks South to reship
or sell them, the ordinary business methods being unsafe, owing to the continued rumblings
of the now rapidly approaching political storm--a storm that promised to be infinitely more
serious than the financial stringency. The choice had fallen on Oliver, he being a Southerner,
and knowing the ways of the people. He had advised with his mother and stood ready to leave
at an hour's notice, when Mr. Slade's heart failed him.

"It's too dangerous, my lad," he said to Oliver. "I could trust you, I know, and I believe
you would return safely and bring the goods or the money with you, but I should never forgive
myself if anything should happen to you. I will send an older man." And he did.

It was at this time that Oliver had received Cockburn's  letter telling him of his own experiences,
and he, therefore, knew something of the risks a man would run, and could appreciate Mr. Slade's
action all the more. Richard, as soon as he heard of it, had put down his tools, left his work-bench,
and had gone into his library, where he had written the firm a letter of thanks, couched in
terms so quaint and courtly, and so full of generous appreciation of their interest in Oliver,
that Mr. Slade, equally appreciative,  had worn it into ribbons in showing it to his friends
as a model of style and chirography.

Remembering his mother's wishes, and in appreciation  of his employer's courtesy, he had kept
up this intimacy with the Slade family until an unfortunate catastrophe had occurred, which
while it did not affect  his welcome at their house, ruined his pleasure while there.

Mr. Slade had invited Oliver to dinner one rainy night, and, being too poor to pay for a cab,
Oliver, in attempting to cross Broadway, had stepped into a mud-puddle a foot deep. He must
either walk back and change his shoes and be late for dinner--an  unpardonable offence--or
he must keep on and run his chances of cleaning them in the dressing-room. There was no dressing-room
available, as it turned out, and the fat English butler had to bring a wet cloth out into the
hall (oh! how he wished for Malachi!) and get down on his stiff knees and wipe away vigorously
before Oliver could present himself before his hostess, the dinner in the meantime getting
cold and the guests being kept waiting. Oliver could never look at those shoes after that without
shivering.

This incident had kept him at home for a time and had made him chary of exposing himself to
similar  mortifications. His stock of clothes at best was limited--especially his shoes--and
as the weather continued bad and the streets impassable, he preferred waiting for clearer skies
and safer walking. So he spent his nights in his room, crooning over the coke fire with Fred,
or all alone if Fred were at the Academy,  drawing from the cast.

On these nights he would begin to long for Kennedy  Square. He had said nothing yet about returning,
even for a day's visit. He knew how his mother felt about it, and he knew how he had seen her
struggle to keep the interest paid up on the mortgage and to meet the daily necessities of
the house. The motor was still incomplete, she wrote him, and success  was as far off as ever.
The mortgage had again been extended and the note renewed--this time for a longer term, owing
to some friend's interest in the matter whose name she could not learn. She, therefore,  felt
no uneasiness on that score, although there were still no pennies which could be spared for
Olivers  travelling expenses, even if he could get leave of absence from his employers.

At these times, as he sat alone in his garret-room, Malachi's chuckle, without cause or reminder
would suddenly ring in his ears, or some low strain from his father's violin or a soft note
from Nathan's flute would float through his brain. "Dear Uncle Nat," he would break out, speaking
aloud and springing  from his chair--"I wish I could hear you tonight."

His only relief while in these moods was to again seize his pen and pour out his heart to his
mother or to his father, or to Miss Clendenning or old Mr. Crocker. Occasionally he would write
to Sue--not often--for that volatile young lady had so far forgotten  Oliver as to leave his
letters unanswered for weeks at a time. She was singing "Dixie," she told him in her last billet-doux,
now a month old, and  wondering whether Oliver was getting to be a Yankee, and whether he would
be coming home with a high collar and his hair cut short and parted in the middle.

His father's letters in return did not lessen his gloom. "These agitators will destroy the
country, my son, if they keep on," Richard had written in his last letter. "It is a sin against
civilization to hold your fellow-men in bondage, and that is why years ago I gave Malachi and
Hannah and the others their freedom, but Virginia has unquestionably the right to govern her
internal affairs without consulting Massachusetts, and that is what many of these Northern
leaders do not or will not understand. I am greatly disturbed over the situation, and I sincerely
hope your own career will not be affected by these troubles. As to my own affairs, all I can
say is that I work early and late, and am out of debt." Poor fellow! He thought he was.

Oliver was sitting thus one night, his head in his hands, elbows on his knees, gazing into
the smouldering  coals of his grate, his favorite attitude when his mind was troubled, when
Fred, his face aglow, his big blue eyes dancing, threw wide the door and bounded in, bringing
in his clothes the fresh, cool air of the night. He had been at work in the School of the Academy
of Design, and had a drawing in chalk under his arm--a head of the young Augustus.

"What's the matter, Ollie, got the blues?"

"No, Freddie, only thinking."

"What's her name? I'll go and see her and make it up. Out with it--do I know her?"

Oliver smiled faintly, examined the drawing for a moment, and handing it back to Fred, said,
sadly, "It's not a girl, Freddie, but I don't seem to get  anywhere."

Fred threw the drawing on the bed and squeezed himself into the chair beside his chum, his
arm around his neck.

"Where do you want to get, old man? What's the matter--any trouble at the store?"

"No--none that I know of. But the life is so monotonous, Fred. You do what you love to do.
I mark boxes all day till lunch-time, then I roll them out on the sidewalk and make out dray
tickets till I come home. I've been doing that all winter; I expect to be doing it for years.
That don't get me anywhere, does it? I hate the life more and more every day."

(Was our hero's old love of change again asserting  itself, or was it only the pinching of
that Chinese shoe which his mother in her anxiety had slipped on his unresisting foot, and
which he was still wearing to please her? Or was it the upper pressure of some inherent talent--some
gift of his ancestors that would not down at his own bidding or that of his mother or anybody
else's?)

"Somebody's got to do it, Ollie, and you are the last man hired," remarked Fred, quietly. "What
would you like to do?"

Oliver shifted himself in the crowded chair until he could look into his room-mate's eyes.

"Fred, old man," he answered, his voice choking, "I haven't said a word to you about it all
the time I've been here, for I don't like to talk about a thing that hurts me, and so I've
kept it to myself. Now I'll tell you the truth just as it is. I don't want Mr. Slade's work
nor anybody else's work. I don't like business and never will. I want to paint, and I'll never
be happy until I do. That's it, fair and square."

"Well, quit Slade, then, and come with me."

"I would if it wasn't for mother. I promised her I would see this through, and I will." As
he spoke the overdue mortgage and his mother's efforts to keep the interest paid passed in
review before him.

Fred caught his breath. It astonished him, independent  young Northerner as he was, to hear
a full- grown man confess that his mother's' apron-strings still held him up, but he made no
comment.

"Why not try both?" he cried. "There's a place in the school alongside of me--we'll work together
nights. It won't interfere with what you do downtown.  You'll get a good start, and when you
have a day off in the summer you can do some out-door work. Waller has told me a dozen times
that you draw better than he did when he commenced. Come along with me."

This conversation, with the other incidents of the day, or rather that part of it which had
reference to the Academy, was duly set forth in his next letter to his mother--not as an argument
to gain her consent  to his studying with Fred, for he knew it was the last thing she would
agree to--but because it was his habit to tell her everything. It would show her, too, how
good a fellow Fred was and what an interest he took in his welfare. Her answer, three days
later, sent him bounding upstairs and into their room like a whirlwind.

"Read, Fred, read!" he cried. "I can go. Mother says she thinks it would be the best thing
in the world for me. Here, clap your eyes on that--" and Oliver held the letter out to Fred,
his finger pointing to this passage: "I wish you would join Fred at the Academy. Now that you
have a regular business  that occupies your mind, and are earning your living, I have no objection
to your studying drawing or learning any other accomplishment. You work hard all day, and this
will rest you."

The cramped foot was beginning to spread! The Chinese shoe had lost its top button.

CHAPTER XII

AROUND THE MILO

Still another new and far more bewildering world was opened to Oliver the night that he entered
the cast-room of the School of the National Academy of Design and took his seat among the students.

The title of the institution, high-sounding as it was, not only truthfully expressed the objects
and purposes  of its founders, but was wofully exact in the sense of its being national; for
outside the bare walls of these rooms there was hardly a student's easel to be found the country
over.

And such forlorn, desolate rooms; up two flights of dusty stairs, in a rickety, dingy loft
off Broadway, within a short walk of Union Square--an auction- room on the ground floor and
a bar-room in the rear. The largest of these rooms was used for the annual exhibition of the
Academicians and their associates, and the smaller ones were given over to the students;  one,
a better lighted apartment, being filled with the usual collection of casts--the Milo, the
Fighting Gladiator, Apollo Belvidere, Venus de Medici, etc., etc.; the other being devoted
to the uses of the life-class and its models. Not the nude. Whatever may have been clone in
the studios, in the class-room it was always the draped model that posed --the old woman who
washed for a living on the top floor, or one of her chubby children or buxom daughters, or
perhaps the peddler who strayed in to sell his wares and left his head behind him on ten different
canvases and in as many different positions.

The casts themselves were backed up against the walls; some facing the windows for lights and
darks, and others pushed toward the middle of the room, where the glow of the gas-jets could
accentuate their better points. The Milo, by right of divinity, held the centre position--she
being beautiful from any point of sight and available from any side. The Theseus  and the Gladiator
stood in the corners, affording space for the stools of two or three students and their necessary
easels. Scattered about on the coarse, whitewashed walls were hung the smaller life-casts;
fragments of the body--an arm, leg, or hand, or sections of a head--and tucked in between could
be found cheap lithographic productions of the work of the students and professors of the Paris
and Dusseldorf  schools. The gas-lights under which the students  worked at night were hooded
by cheap paper shades of the students' own fashioning, and the lower sashes of the windows
were smeared with whitewash or covered with newspapers to concentrate the light. During working
hours the drawing-boards were propped upon rude easels or slanted on overturned chairs, the
students sitting on three-legged stools.

A gentle-voiced, earnest, whole-souled old man-- the one only instructor--presided over this
temple of art. He had devoted his whole life to the sowing of figs and the reaping of thistles,
and in his old age was just beginning to see the shoots of a new art forcing  their way through
the quickening clay of American  civilization. Once in awhile, as assistants in this almost
hopeless task, there would stray into his class-room some of the painters who, unconsciously,
were founding a national art and in honor of whom a grateful nation will one day search the
world over for marble white enough on which to perpetuate their memories: men as distinct in
their aims, methods,  and results as was that other group of unknown and despised immortals
starving together at that very time in a French village across the sea--and men, too, equally
deserving of the esteem and gratitude  of their countrymen.

Oliver knew the names of these distinguished visitors  to the Academy, as did all the other
members of the Skylarks, and he knew their work. The pictures  of George Inness, Sanford Gifford,
Kensett, McEntee, Hart, Eastman Johnson, Hubbard, Church, Casilaer, Whittredge, and the others
had been frequently discussed around the piano on the top floor at Miss Teetum's, and their
merits and supposed  demerits often hotly contested. He had met Kensett once at the house of
Mr. Slade, and McEntee had been pointed out to him as he left the theatre one night, but few
of the others had ever crossed his path.

Of the group Gifford appealed to him most. One golden "Venice" of the painter, which hung in
a picture-store, always delighted him--a stretch of the Lagoon with a cluster of butterfly
sails and a far- away line of palaces, towers, and domes lying like a string of pearls on the
horizon. There was another of Kensett's, a point of rocks thrust out like a mailed hand into
a blue sea; and a McEntee of October woods, all brown and gold; but the Gifford he had never
forgotten; nor will anyone else who has seen it.

No wonder then that all his life he remembered that particular night, when a slender, dark-haired
man in loose gray clothes sauntered into the class- room and moved around among the easels,
giving a suggestion here and a word of praise there, for that was the night on which Professor
Cummings touched our young hero's shoulder and said: "Mr. Gifford likes your drawing very much,
Mr. Horn"--a word of praise which, as he wrote to Crocker, steadied his uncertain fingers "as
nothing else had ever done."

The students in his school were from all stations in life: young and old; all of them poor,
and most of them struggling along in kindred professions and occupations--engravers, house-painters,
lithographers,  and wood-carvers. Two or three were sign- painters. One of these--a big-boned,
blue-eyed young follow, who drew in charcoal from the cast at night, and who sketched the ships
in the harbor during the day--came from Kennedy Square, or rather from one of the side streets
leading out of it.	There can still be found over the door of what was once his shop a weather-beaten
example of his skill in gold letters, the product of his own hand. Above the signature is,
or was some ten years since, a small decorative panel showing a strip of yellow sand, a black
dot of a boat, and a line of blue sky, so true in tone and sure in composition that when Mr.
Crocker first passed that way and stood astounded before it--as did Robinson Crusoe over Friday's
footprint--he was so overjoyed to find another artist besides himself in the town, that he
turned into the shop, and finding only a young mechanic at work, said:

"Go to New York, young man, and study, you have a career before you."

The old landscape-painter was a sure prophet; little  pen-and-ink sketches bearing the initials
of this same sign-painter now sell for more than their weight in gold, while his larger canvases
on the walls of our museums and galleries hold their place beside the work of the marine-painters
of our own and other times and will for many a day to come.

This exile from Kennedy Square had been the first man to shake Oliver's hand the night he entered
the cast-room. Social distinctions had no place in this atmosphere; it was the fellow who in
his work came closest to the curve of the shoulder or to the poise of the head who proved,
in the eyes of his fellow- students, his possession of an ancestry: but the ancestry  was one
that skipped over the Mayflower and went straight back to the great Michael and Rembrandt.

"I'm Jack Bedford, the sign-painter," he said, heartily. "You and I come from the same town,"
and as they grasped each other's hands a new friendship  was added to Oliver's rapidly increasing
list.

Oliver's seat was next to Fred, with Jack Bedford on his right. He had asked to join this group
not only because he wanted to be near his two friends but because he wanted still more to be
near the Milo. He had himself selected a certain angle of the head because he had worked from
that same point of sight with Mr. Crocker, and it had delighted him beyond measure when the
professor allowed him to place his stool so that he could almost duplicate his earlier drawing.
His ambition was to get into the life-class, and the quickest road, he knew, lay through a
good cast drawing. Every night for a week, therefore, he had followed the wonderful lines of
the Milo's beautiful body, which seemed to grow with warmth under the flare of the overhanging
gas-jets.

These favored life students occupied the room next to the casts. Mother Mulligan, in full regalia
of apron and broom, often sat there as a model. Oliver  had recognized her portrait at once;
so can anyone  else who looks over the earlier studies of half the painters of the time.

"Oh, it's you, is it--" Mrs. Mulligan herself had cried when she met Oliver in the hall, "the
young gentleman that saved Miss Margaret's dog? She'll be here next week herself--she's gone
home for awhile up into the mountains, where her old father and mother live. I told her many
times about ye, and she'll be that pleased to meet ye, now that you're WAN of us."

It was delightful to hear her accent the "wan." Mother Mulligan always thought the institution
rested on her broad shoulders, and that the students were part of her family.

The old woman could also have told Oliver of Margaret's  arrival at the school, and of the
impression which she, the first and only girl student, made on the night she took her place
before an easel. But of the reason of her coming Mrs. Mulligan could have told nothing, nor
why Margaret had been willing  to exchange the comforts of a home among the New Hampshire hills
for the narrow confines of a third-story back room, with Mrs. Mulligan as house- keeper and
chaperon.

Fred knew all the details, of course, and how it had all come about. How a cousin of Margaret's
who lived on a farm near her father's had one day, years before, left his plough standing in
the furrow and apprenticed himself to a granite-cutter in the next town. How later on he had
graduated in gravestones, and then in bas-reliefs, and finally had won a medal in Rome for
a figure of "Hope," which was to mark the grave of a millionnaire at home. How when the statue
was finished, ready to be set up, this cousin had come to Brookfield, wearing a square- cut
beard, straight-out mustaches with needle-points, and funny shoes with square toes. How the
girl had been disposed to laugh at him until he had told her stories of the wonderful cities
beyond the sea and of his life among the painters and sculptors; then she showed him her own
drawings, searching his face anxiously with her big eyes. How he had been so astounded and
charmed by their delicacy and truth, that he had pleaded with her father--an obstinate old
Puritan--to send her to New York to study, which the old man refused point-blank to do, only
giving his consent at the last when her brother John, who had been graduated from Dartmouth
and knew something of the outside world, had joined his voice to that of her mother and her
own. How when she at last entered the class-room of the Academy the students had looked askance
at her; the usual talk had ceased, and for a time there had been an uncomfortable restraint
everywhere, until the men found her laughing quietly at their whispered  jokes about her. After
that the "red-headed girl in blue gingham," as she was called, had become, by virtue of that
spirit of camaraderie which a common  pursuit develops, "one of us" in spirit as well as in
occupation.

Fred had described it all to Oliver, and every night when Oliver came in from the hall, his
eyes had wandered over the group of students in the hope of seeing the strange person. A girl
studying art, or anything else for that matter, seemed to him to be as incongruous as for a
boy to learn dress-making or for a woman to open a barber-shop. He knew her type, he said to
himself: she would be thin and awkward,  with an aggressive voice that would jar on the stillness
of the room. And she would believe in the doctrines of Elizabeth Cady Stanton--a name never
mentioned by his mother except apologetically and in a low voice--and when she became older
she would address meetings and become conspicuous in church and have her name printed in the
daily papers.

Our hero's mind was intent upon these phases of character always to be found, of course, in
a girl who would unsex herself to the extent that Miss Grant had done, when one night a rich,
full, well-modulated voice sounding over his shoulder said:

"Excuse me, but Mother Mulligan tells me that you are Mr. Horn, Fred Stone's friend. I want
to thank you for taking care of my poor Juno. It was very good of you. I am Margaret Grant."

She had approached him without his seeing her. He turned quickly to accost her and immediately
lost so much of his breath that he could only stammer his thanks, and the hope that Juno still
enjoyed the best of health. But the deep-brown eyes did not waver after acknowledging his reply,
nor did the smile about the mouth relax.

"And I'm so glad you've come at last," she went on. "Fred has told me how you wanted to draw
and couldn't. I know something myself of what it is to hunger after a thing and not get it."

He was on his feet now, the bit of charcoal still between his fingers, his shirt-cuff rolled
back to give his hand more freedom. His senses were coming back, too, and there was buoyancy
as well as youth in his face.

"Yes, I do love it," said Oliver, and his eyes wandered over her wonderful hair that looked
like brown gold illumined by slants of sunshine, and then rested for an instant on her eyes.
"I drew with old Mr. Crocker at home, but we only had one cast, just the head of the Milo,
and I was the only pupil. Here everything helps me. What are you at work on, Miss Grant?"

"I'm doing the Milo, too; my seat is right in front of yours. Oh! what a good beginning," and
she bent over his drawing-board. "Why, this can't be your first week," and she scanned it closely.
"One minute--a little too full under the chin, isn't it?" She picked up a piece of chalk, and
pointed to the shaded lines, looking first with half-closed eyes at the full-sized cast before
them, and then at the drawing.

"Yes, I think you're right," said Oliver, studying the cast also with half-closed eyes. "How
will that do?" and he smudged the shadow with his finger-tip.

"Just right," she answered. "How well you have the character of the face. Isn't she lovely!--I
know of nothing so beautiful. There is such a queenly, womanly, self-poised simplicity about her."

Oliver thought so too, and said so with his eyes, only it was of a face framed in brown-gold
that he was thinking and not of one of white plaster. He was touched too by the delicate way
in which she had commended his drawings. It was the "woman" in her that pleased him, just as
it had been in Sue--that subtle, dominating influence which our fine gentleman  could never resist.

He shifted his stool a little to one side so that he could see her the better unobserved while
she was  arranging her seat and propping up her board. He noticed that, although her face was
tanned by the weather, her head was set on a neck of singular whiteness.  Underneath, where
the back hair was tucked up, his eye caught some delicate filmy curls which softened the line
between her throat and head and shone in the light like threads of gold. The shoulders  sloped
and the whole fulness of her figure tapered  to a waist firmly held by a leather belt. A wholesome
girl, he thought to himself, and good to look at, and with a certain rhythmic grace about her
movements.

Her crowning glory, though, was her hair, which was parted over her forehead and caught in
a simple twist behind. As the light fell upon it he observed again how full it was of varying
tones like those found in the crinklings of a satin gown--yellow-gold one minute and dark brown
the next. Oliver wondered  how long this marvellous hair might be, and whether it would reach
to the floor if it should burst its fastenings and whether Sir Peter Lely would have loved
it too could he have seen this flood of gold bathing  her brow and shoulders.

He found it delightful to work within a few feet of her, silent as they had to be, for much
talking was discountenanced by the professor: often hours passed without any sound being heard
in the room but that of the scraping of the chairs on the bare floor or the shifting of an easel.

Two or three times during the evening the old professor  emerged from his room and overlooked
his drawing, patiently pointing out the defects and as patiently correcting them. He was evidently
impressed with Oliver's progress, for he remarked to Miss Grant, in a low voice:

"The new student draws well--he is doing first- rate," and passed on. Oliver caught the expression
of satisfaction on the professor's face and interpreted  it as in some way applying to his
work, although  he did not catch the words.

The old man rarely had to criticise Margaret's work. The suggestions made to her came oftener
from the students than from the professor himself or any one of the visiting critics. In these
criticisms, not only of her own work but of the others, everyone  took part, each leaving his
stool and helping in the discussion, when the work of the night was over. Fred's more correct
eye, for instance, would be invaluable  to Jack Bedford, the ex-sign-painter, who was struggling
with the profile of the Gladiator; or Margaret, who could detect at a glance the faintest departure
from the lines of the original, would shorten a curve on Oliver's drawing, or he in turn would
advise her about the depth of a shadow or the spot for a high light.

As the nights went by and Oliver studied her the closer, the New England girl became all the
more inexplicable to him. She was, he could not but admit,  like no other woman he had ever
met; certainly not in his present surroundings. She really seemed to belong to some fabled
race--one of the Amazons, or Rhine maidens, or Norse queens for whom knights couched their
lances. It was useless to compare  her to any one of the girls about Kennedy Square, for she
had nothing in common with any one of them. Was it because she was unhappy among her own people
that she had thus exiled herself from her home, or had some love-affair blighted her life?
Or could it be, as Fred had suggested, that she was willing to undergo all these discomforts
and privations  simply for love of her art? As this possible solution of the vexing problem
became established in his mind, with the vision of Margaret herself before  him, the blood
mounted to his cheeks and an uncontrollable  thrill of enthusiasm swept over him. He could
forgive her anything if this last motive had really controlled and shaped her life.

Had he seen the more closely and with prophetic vision, he would have discerned, in this Norse
queen with the golden hair, the mother of a long line of daughters, who, in the days to follow,
would hang their triumphant shields beside those of their brothers, winning equal recognition
in salon and gallery  and conferring equal honor on their country. But Oliver's vision was
no keener than that of anyone  else about him. It was only the turn of Margaret's  head that
caught the young student's eye and the wealth of her brown-gold hair. With the future he had
no concern.

What attracted him most of all in this woman who had violated all the known traditions of Kennedy
Square, was a certain fearlessness of manner--an  independence, a perfect ingenuousness, and
a freedom from any desire to interest the students in herself. When she looked at any one of
them, it was never from under drooping eyelids, as Sue would have done, nor with that coquettish,
alluring glance to which he had always been accustomed. She looked straight at them with unflinching
eyes that said, "I can trust you, and WILL." He had never seen exactly that look except in
the portrait of his uncle's grandmother by Sir Peter Lely--the picture he had always loved.
Strange to say, too, the eyes of the portrait were Margaret's eyes, and so was the color of
the hair.

No vexed problems entered Margaret's head regarding  the very engaging young gentleman who
sat behind HER stool. He merely represented to her another  student--that was all; the little
band was small enough, and she was glad to see the new ones come. She noticed, it is true,
certain unmistakable differences--a peculiar, soft cadence in his voice as the words slipped
from his lips without their final g's; a certain deference to herself--standing until she regained
her seat, an attention which she attributed at first to embarrassment over his new surroundings
and to his desire to please. She noticed, too, a certain  grace in his movements--a grace that
attracted her, especially in the way with which he used his hands, and in the way in which
he threw his head up when he laughed; but even these differences ceased to interest her after
the first night of their meeting.

But it did not occur to her that he came from any different stock than the others about her,
or that his blood might or might not be a shade bluer than her own. What had really impressed
her more than anything  else--and this only flashed into her mind while she was looking in
the glass one night at her own-- were his big white teeth, white as grains of corn, and the
cleanliness of his hands and nails. She liked these things about him. Some of the fingers that
rested on her drawing-board were often more like clothes-pins than fingers, and shocked her
not a little; some, too, were stained with acids, and one or more with printer's ink that no
soap could remove.

Before the evening was over Oliver became one of the class-room appointments--a young man who
sat one stool behind her and was doing fairly well with his first attempt, and who would some
day be able to make a creditable drawing if he had patience and application.

At the beginning of the second week a new student appeared--or rather an old one, who had been
laid up at home with a cold. When Oliver arrived he found him in Margaret's seat, his easel
standing where hers had been. He had a full-length drawing of the Milo--evidently the work
of days--nearly finished on his board. Oliver was himself a little ahead of time--ahead of
either Margaret or Fred, and had noticed the new-comer when he entered, the room being nearly
empty. Jack Bedford was already at work.

"Horn," Jack cried, and beckoned to Oliver-- "see the beggar in Miss Grant's seat. Won't there
be a jolly row when she comes in?"

Margaret entered a moment later, her portfolio under her arm, and stood taking in the situation.
Then she walked straight to her former seat, and said, in a firm but kindly tone:

"This is my place, sir. I've been at work here for a week. You see my drawing is nearly done."

The young man looked up. He toiled all day in a lithographer's shop, and these precious nights
in the loft were his only glimpses of happiness. He sat without his coat, his shirt-sleeves
liberally smeared with the color-stains of his trade.

"Well, it's my place, too. I sat here a week before  I was taken sick," he said, in a slightly
indignant  tone, looking into Margaret's face in astonishment.

"But if you did," continued Margaret, "you see I am nearly through. I can't take another seat,
for I'll lose the angle. I can finish in an hour if you will please give me this place to-night.
You can work just as well by sitting a few feet farther along."

The lithographer, without replying, turned from her impatiently, bent over his easel, picked
up a fresh bit of charcoal and corrected a line on the Milo's shoulder. So far as he was concerned
the argument was closed.

Margaret stood patiently. She thought at first he was merely adding a last touch to his drawing
before granting her request.

"Will you let me have the seat?" she asked.

"No," he blurted out. He was still bending over his drawing, his eyes fixed on the work. He
did not even look up. "I'm going to stay here until I finish. You know the rules as well as
I do. I wouldn't take your seat--what do you want to take mine for?" There was no animosity
in his voice. He spoke as if announcing a fact.

The words had hardly left his lips when there came the sound of a chair being quickly pushed
back, and Oliver stood beside Margaret. His eyes were flashing; his right shirt-cuff was rolled
back, the bit of charcoal still between his fingers. Every muscle of his body was tense with
anger. Margaret's quick instinct took in the situation at a glance. She saw Oliver's wrath
and she knew its cause.

"Don't, Mr. Horn, please--please!" she cried, putting up her hand. "I'll begin another drawing.
I see now that I took his seat when he was away, although  I didn't know it."

Oliver stepped past her. "Get up, sir," he said, "and give Miss Grant her seat. What do you
mean by speaking so to a lady?"

The apprentice--his name was Judson--raised his eyes quickly, took in Oliver's tense, muscular
figure  standing over him, and said, with a contemptuous wave of the hand:

"Young feller--you go and cool off somewhere, or I'll tell the professor. It's none of your
business. I know the rules and--"

He never finished the sentence--not that anybody heard. He was floundering on the floor, an
overturned  easel and drawing-board lying across his body; Oliver standing over him with his
fists tightly clenched.

"I'll teach you how to behave to a lady." The words sounded as if they came from between closed
teeth. "Here's your chair, Miss Grant," and with a slight bow he placed the chair before her
and resumed his seat with as much composure as if he had been in his mother's drawing-room
in Kennedy Square.

Margaret was so astounded. that for a moment she could not speak. Then her voice came back
to her. "I don't want it," she cried, in a half-frightened  way, the tears starting in her
eyes. "It was never mine--I told you so. Oh, what have you done?"

Never since the founding of the school had there been such a scene. The students jumped from
their chairs and crowded about the group. The life class, which were at work in another room,
startled by the uproar, swarmed out eager to know what had happened  and why--and who--and
what for. Old Mother Mulligan, who had been posing for the class, with a cloak about her fat
shoulders and a red  handkerchief binding up her head, rushed over to Margaret,  thinking she
had been hurt in some way, until she saw the student on the floor, still panting and half-dazed
from the effect of Oliver's blow. Then she fell on her knees beside him.

At this instant Professor Cummings entered, and a sudden hush fell upon the room. Judson, with
the help of Mother Mulligan's arm, had picked himself up, and. would have made a rush at Oliver
had not big sack Bedford stopped him.

"Who's to blame for this?" asked the professor, looking from one to the other.

Oliver rose from his seat.

"This man insulted Miss Grant and I threw him out of her chair," he answered quietly.

"Insulted you!" cried the professor, in surprise, and he turned to Margaret. "What did he say?"

"I never said a word to her," whined Judson, straightening his collar. "I told her the seat
was mine, and so it is. That wasn't insulting her."

"It's all a mistake, professor--Mr. Horn did not understand," protested Margaret. "It was his
seat, not mine. He began his drawing first. I didn't know it when I commenced mine. I told
Mr. Horn so."

"Why did you strike him?" asked the professor, and he turned and faced Oliver.

"Because he had no business to speak to her as he did. She is the only lady we have among us
and every man in the class ought to remember it, and every man has since I've been here except
this one."

There was a slight murmur of applause. Judson's early training had been neglected as far as
his manners  went, and he was not popular.

The professor looked searchingly into Oliver's eyes and a flush of pride in the boy's pluck
tinged his pale cheeks. He had once thrown a fellow-student out of a window in Munich himself
for a similar offence, and old as he was he had never forgotten it.

"You come from the South, Mr. Horn, I hear," he said in a gentler voice, "and you are all a
hot- tempered race, and often do foolish things. Judson meant no harm--he says so, and Miss
Grant says so. Now you two shake hands and make up. We are trying to learn to draw here, not
to batter each other's heads."

Oliver's eyes roved from one to the other; he was too astonished to make further reply. He
had only done what he knew every other man around Kennedy Square would have done under similar
circumstances, and what any other woman would have thanked him for. Why was everybody here
against him--even the girl herself! What sort of people were these who would stand by and see
a woman insulted and make no defence or outcry? He could not have looked his father in the
face again, nor Sue, nor anyone else in Kennedy Square, if he had failed to protect her.

For a moment he hesitated, his eyes searching each face. He had hoped that someone who had
witnessed the outrage would come forward and uphold his act. When no voice broke the stillness
he crossed the room and taking the lithographer's hand, extended rather sullenly, answered,
quietly: "If Miss Grant is satisfied, I am," and peace was once more restored.

Margaret sharpened her charcoals and bent over her drawing. She was so agitated she could not
trust herself to touch its surface. "If I am SATISFIED," she kept repeating to herself. The
words, somehow, seemed to carry a reproach with them. "Why shouldn't I be satisfied.? I have
no more rights in the room than the other students about me; that is, I thought I hadn't until
I heard what he said. How foolish for him to cause all this fuss about nothing, and make me
so conspicuous."

But even as she said the words to herself she remembered  Oliver's tense figure and the look
of indignation  on his face. She had never been accustomed  to seeing men take up the cudgels
for women. There had been no opportunity, perhaps, nor cause, but even if there had been, she
could think of no one whom she had ever met who would have done as much for her just because
she was a woman.

A little sob, which she could not have explained to herself, welled up to her throat. Much
as she gloried in her own self-reliance, she suddenly and unexpectedly found herself exulting
in a quality heretofore unknown to her--that quality which had compelled an almost total stranger
to take her part. Then the man himself! How straight and strong and handsome he was as he stood
looking at Judson,  and then the uplifted arm, the quick spring, and, best of all, the calm,
graceful way in which he had handed her the chair! She could not get the picture  out of her
mind. Last, she remembered with a keen sense of pleasure the chivalrous look in his face when
he held out his hand to the man who a moment before had received its full weight about his throat.

She had not regained mastery of herself even when she leaned across her drawing-board, pretending
to be absorbed in her work. The curves of the Milo seemed in some strange way to have melted
into the semblance of the outlines of other visions sunk deep in her soul since the days of
her childhood--visions which for years past had been covered over by the ice of a cold, hard
puritanical training, that had  prevented any bubbles of sentiment from ever rising to the
surface of her heart. As remembrances of these visions rushed through her mind the half-draped
woman, with the face of the Madonna and the soul of the Universal Mother shining through every
line of her beautiful body, no longer stood before her. It was a knight in glittering armor
now, with drawn sword and visor up, beneath which looked out the face of a beautiful youth
aflame with the fire of a holy zeal. She caught the flash of the sun on his breastplate of
silver, and the sweep of his blade, and heard his clarion voice sing out. And then again, as
she closed her eyes, this calm, lifeless cast became a gallant, blue-eyed prince, who knelt
beside her and kissed her finger-tips, his doffed plumes trailing at her feet.

When the band of students were leaving the rooms that night, Margaret called Oliver to her
side, and  extending her hand, said, with a direct simplicity that carried conviction in every
tone of her voice and in which no trace of her former emotions were visible:

"I hope you'll forgive me, Mr. Horn. I'm all alone here in this city and I have grown so accustomed
to depending on myself that, perhaps, I failed to understand how you felt about it. I am very
grateful to you. Good-night."

She had turned away before he could do more than express his regret over the occurrence. He
wanted to follow her; to render her some assistance; to comfort her in some way. It hurt him
to see her go out alone into the night. He wished he might offer his arm, escort her home,
make some atonement for the pain he had caused her. But there was a certain proud poise of
the head and swift glance of the eye which held him back.

While he stood undecided whether to break through her reserve and join her, he saw Mrs. Mulligan
come out of the basement, stop a passing stage, and, helping Margaret in, take the seat beside her.

"I am glad she does not go out alone," he said to himself and turned away.

CHAPTER XIII

BELOW MOOSE HILLOCK

It was not long before the bare rooms of the Academy School--owing to the political situation,
which necessitated the exercise of economies in every direction--began to suffer.

One night the students found the gas turned out and a small card tacked on the door of the
outer hall. It read--

SCHOOL CLOSED FOR WANT OF

FUNDS. WILL PERHAPS BE

OPENED IN THE AUTUMN.

Signs of like character were not unusual in the history  of the school. The wonder was, considering
the vicissitudes through which the Academy had passed, that it was opened at all. From the
institution's earlier  beginnings in the old house on Bond Street, to its flight from the loft
close to Grace Church and then to the abandoned building opposite the old hotel near Washington
Square, where Amos Cobb always stayed when he came to New York, and so on down to its own home
on Broadway, its history had been one long struggle for recognition and support.

This announcement, bitter enough as it was to Oliver, was followed by another even more startling,
when he reached the office next day, and Mr. Slade called him into his private room.

"Mr. Horn," said his employer, motioning Oliver to a seat and drawing his chair close beside
him so that he could lay his hand upon the young man's knee, "I am very sorry to tell you that
after the first of June we shall be obliged to lay you off. It is not because we are dissatisfied
with your services, for you have been a faithful clerk, and we all like you and wish you could
stay, but the fact is if this repudiation  goes on we will all be ruined. I am not going to
discharge you; I'm only going to give you a holiday  for a few months. Then, if the war-scare
blows over we want you back again. I appreciate that this has come as suddenly upon you as
it has upon us, and I hope you will not feel offended when, in addition to your salary, I hand
you the firm's check for an extra amount. You must not look upon it as a gift, for you have
earned every cent of it."

These two calamities were duly reported in a ten- page letter to his mother by our young hero,
sitting alone, as he wrote, up in his sky-parlor, crooning over his dismal coke fire. "Was
he, then, to begin over again the weary tramping of the streets?" he said to himself. "And
the future! What did that hold in store for him? Would the time ever come when he could follow
the bent of his tastes? He was getting on so well--even Miss Grant had said so--and it had
not interfered with his work at the store, either. The check in his pocket proved that."

His mother's answer made his heart bound with joy.

"Take Mr. Slade at his word. He is your friend and means what he says. Find a place for the
summer where you can live cheaply and where the little money which you now have will pay your
way. In the fall you can return to your work. Don't think of coming home, much as I should
like to put my arms around you. I cannot spare the money to bring you here now, as I have just
paid the interest on the mortgage.  Moreover, the whole of Kennedy Square is upset and our
house seems to be the centre of disturbance.  Your father's views on slavery are well known,
and he is already being looked upon with disfavor  by some of our neighbors. At the club the
other night he and Judge Bowman had some words which were very distressing to me. Mr. Cobb
was present, and was the only one who took your father's part. Your father, as you may imagine,
is very anxious  over the political situation, but I cannot think our people are going to fight
and kill each other, as Colonel Clayton predicts they will before another year has passed."

Oliver's heart bounded like a loosened balloon as he laid down his mother's letter and began
pacing the room. Neither the political outlook, nor club discussions,  nor even his mother's
hopes and fears, concerned  him. It was the sudden loosening of all his bonds that thrilled
him. Four months to do as he pleased in; the dreadful mortgage out of the way for six months;
his mother willing, and he with money enough in his pocket to pay his way without calling upon
her for a penny! Was there ever such luck! All care rolled from his shoulders--even the desire
to see his mother and Sue and those whom he loved at home was forgotten in the rosy prospect
before him.

The next day he told Mr. Slade of his plans, and read him part of his mother's letter.

"Very sensible woman, your mother," his employer  answered, with his bluff heartiness. "Just
the thing for you to do; and I've got the very spot. Go to Ezra Pollard's. He lives up in the
mountains  at a little place called East Branch, on the edge of a wilderness. I fish there
every spring, and I'll give you a letter to him."

Long before his day of departure came he had dusted out his old hair trunk--there were other
and more modern trunks to be had, but Oliver loved this one because it had been his father's--gathered
his painting materials together -- his easel, brushes, leather case, and old slouch hat that
he wore to fish in at home--and spent his time counting the days and hours when he could leave
the world behind him and, as he wrote Fred, "begin to live."

He was not alone in this planning for a summer exodus. The other students had indeed all cut
their tether-strings and disappeared long before his own freedom came. Jack Bedford had gone
to the coast to live with a fisherman and paint the surf, and Fred was with his people away
up near the lakes. As for the lithographers, sign-painters, and beginners, they were spending
their evenings somewhere else than in the old room under the shaded gas-jets. Even Margaret,
so Mother Mulligan told him, was up "wid her folks, somewheres."

"And she was that broken-hearted," she added, "whin they shut up the school--bad cess to 'em!
Oh, ye would a-nigh kilt yerself wid grief to a-seen her, poor darlint."

"Where is her home?" asked Oliver, ignoring the tribute to his sympathetic tendencies. He had
no reason for asking, except that she had been the only woman among them, and he accordingly
felt that a certain courtesy was due her even in her absence.

"I've bothered me head loose tryin' to remimber, but for the soul o' me, I can't. It's cold
enough up there, I know, to freeze ye solid, for Miss Margaret had wan o' her ears nipped last
time she was home."

And so one fine morning in June, with Oliver bursting with happiness, the hair trunk and the
leather case and sketching umbrella were thrown out at a New England way-station in the gray
dawn from a train in which Oliver had spent the night curled up on one of the seats.

Just as he had expected, the old coach that was to carry him was waiting beside the platform.
There was a rush for top seats, and Oliver got the one beside  the driver, and the trunk and
traps were stored in the boot under the driver's seat--it was a very small trunk and took up
but little room--and Marvin cracked his whip and away everybody went, the dogs barking behind
and the women waving their aprons from the porches of the low houses facing the road.

And it was a happy young fellow who filled his lungs with the fresh air of the morning and
held on to the iron rail of the top seat as they bumped over the "Thank ye marms," and who
asked the driver innumerable questions which it was part of the noted whip's duty and always
his pleasure to answer. The squirrels darted across the road as if to get a look at the enthusiast
and then ran for their lives to escape the wheels; and the crows heard the rumble and rose
in a body from the sparse cornfields for a closer view; and the big trees arched over his head,
cooling the air and casting big shadows, and even the sun kept peeping  over the edge of the
hills from behind some jutting  rock or clump of pines or hemlock as if bent on lighting up
his face so that everybody could see how happy he was.

As the day wore on and the coach rattled over the big open bridge that spanned the rushing
mountain- stream, Oliver's eye caught, far up the vista, the little dent in the line of blue
that stood low against the sky. The driver said this was the Notch and that the big hump to
the right was Moose Hillock, and that Ezra's cabin nestled at its feet and was watered by the
rushing  stream, only it was a tiny little brook away up there that anybody could step over.

"'Tain't bigger'n yer body where it starts out fresh up in them mountings," the driver said,
touching his leaders behind their ears with the lash of his whip. "Runs clean round Ezra's,
and's jest as chuckfull o' trout, be gosh, as a hive is o' bees."

And the swing and the freedom of it all! No office- hours to keep; no boxes to nail up and
roll out--nothing  but sweetness and cool draughts of fresh mountain-air,  and big trees that
he wanted to get down and hug; and jolly laughing brooks that ran out to meet him and called
to him as he trotted along, or as the horses did, which was the same thing, he being part of
the team.

And the day! Had there ever been such another? And the sky, too, filled with soft white clouds
that sailed away over his head--the little ones far in advance and already crowding up the
Notch, which was getting nearer every hour.

And Marvin the driver--what a character he was and how quaint his speech. And the cabins by
the road, with their trim fences and winter's wood piled up so neatly under the sheds--all
so different from any which he had seen at the South and all so charming  and exhilarating.

Never had he been so happy!

And why not? Twenty-three and in perfect health, without a care, and for the first time in
all his life doing what he wanted most to do, with  opportunities opening every hour for doing
what he  believed he could do best.

Oh, for some planet where such young saplings can grow without hinderance from the ignorant
and the unsympathetic; where they can reach out for the sun on all sides and stretch their
long arms skyward; where each vine can grow as it would in all the luxuriance  of its nature,
free from the pruning-knife of criticism and the straitlaced trellis of  conventionality--a
planet on which the Puritan with his  creeds, customs, fads, issues, and dogmas, and the  Cavalier
with his traditions and time-honored notions  never sat foot. Where every round peg fits a
round hole, and men toil with a will and with unclouded brows because their hearts find work
for their hands and each day's task is a joy.

If the road and the country on each side of it, and the giant trees, now that they neared the
mountains, and the deep ravines and busy, hurrying brooks had each inspired some exclamation
of joy from Oliver, the first view of Ezra's cabin filled him so full of  uncontrollable delight
that he could hardly keep his seat long enough for Marvin to rein in his horses and get down
and swing back the gate that opened into the pasture surrounding the house.

"Got a boarder for ye, Ezra," Marvin called to Oliver's prospective host, who had come down
to meet the stage and get his empty butter-pails. Then, in a lower tone: "Sezs he's a painter
chap, and that Mr. Slade sent him up. He's goin' to bunk in with ye all summer, he sezs. Seems
like a knowin', happy kind er young feller."

They were pulling the pails from the rear boot, each one tied up in a wheat-sack, with a card
marked "Ezra Pollard" sewed on the outside to distinguish it from the property of other East
Branch settlers up and down the road.

Oliver had slipped from his seat and was tugging at his hair trunk. He did not know that the
long, thin, slab-sided old fellow in a slouch hat, hickory shirt crossed by one suspender,
and heavy cowhide boots was his prospective landlord. He supposed him to be the hired man,
and that he would find Mr. Pollard  waiting for him in the little sitting-room with the windows
full of geraniums that looked so inviting  and picturesque.

"Marve sez you're lookin' fur me. Come along. Glad ter see ye."

"Are you Mr. Pollard?" His surprise not only marked the tones of his voice but the expression
of his face.

"No, jes' Ezry Pollard, that's all. Hope Mr. Slade's up and hearty?"

Mr. Slade was never so "up and hearty" as was Oliver that next morning.

Up with the sun he was, and hearty as a young buck out of a bed of mountain-moss.

"Time to be movin', ain't it?" came Ezra Pollard's  voice, shouting up the unpainted staircase,
"Hank's drawed a bucket out here at the well for ye to wash in. Needn't worry about no towel.
Samanthy's  got one fur ye, but ye kin bring yer comb."

At the sound of Ezra's voice Oliver sprang from the coarse straw mattress--it had been as eider-down
to his stage-jolted body--pushed open the wooden blind and peered out. The sun was peeping
over the edge of the Notch and looking with wide eyes into the saucer-shaped valley in which
the cabin stood. The fogs which at twilight had stolen down to the meadows  and had made a
night of it, now startled into life by the warm rays of the sun, were gathering up their skirts
of shredded mist and tiptoeing back up the hill-side, looking over their shoulders as they
fled. The fresh smell of the new corn watered by the night dew and the scent of pine and balsam
from the woods about him, filled the morning air. Songs of birds were all about, a robin on
a fence-post and two larks high in air, singing as they flew.

Below him, bounding from rock to rock, ran the brook, laughing in the sunlight and tossing
the spray high in the air in a mad frolic. Across this swirling line of silver lay a sparse
meadow strewn with rock, plotted with squares of last year's crops--potatoes, string-beans,
and cabbages, and now combed into straight green lines of early buckwheat and turnips. Beyond
this a ragged pasture, fenced with blackened stumps, from which came the tinkle of cow-bells,
and farther on the grim, silent forest--miles and miles of forest seamed by a single road leading
to Moose Hillock  and the great Stone Face.

Oliver slipped into his clothes; ran down the stairs and out into the fresh morning air. As
he walked toward the well his eyes caught sight of Hank's bucket tilted on one edge of the
well-curb, over which hung the big sweep, its lower end loaded with stone. On the platform
stood a wooden bench sloppy with the drippings of the water-soaked pail. This bench held a
tin basin and half a bar of rosin soap. Beside it was a single post sprouting hickory prongs,
on which were hung as many cleanly scoured milk- pails glittering in the sun. On this post
Hank had nailed a three-cornered piece of looking-glass--Hank had a sweetheart in the village
below--a necessity and useful luxury, he told Oliver afterward, "in slickin' yerself up fer meals."

Once out in the sunshine Oliver, with the instinct of the painter suddenly roused, looked about
him. He found that the cabin which had delighted him so in the glow of the afternoon, was even
more enchanting in the light of the morning. To the plain, every-day, practical man it was
but a long box with a door in the middle of each side, front and back--one opening into a sitting-room,
which again opened into a bedroom  in which Ezra and his wife slept, with the windows  choked
with geraniums, their red cheeks pressed against the small panes, and the other opening into
a kitchen, connecting with a pantry and a long, rambling woodshed. To our young Raphael the
simple cabin, from its homely sagging door to its broken-backed roof, covered with rotting
shingles, was nothing less than an enchanted palace.

He remembered the shingles. He had reached up in the night and touched them with his hands.
He remembered, too, the fragrance they gave out--a hot, dry, spicy smell. He remembered also
the dried apples spread out on a board beside his bed, and the broken spinning-wheel, and the
wasp's nest. He was sure, too, there were many other fascinating relics stored away in this
old attic. But for the sputtering tallow-candle, which the night before was nearly burnt out,
he would have examined everything else about him before he went to sleep.

Then his eye fell on the woodshed and the huge pile of chips that Hank's axe had made in supplying
Samanthy's stove, and the rickety, clay-plastered buggy and buckboard that had never known
water since the day of their birth. And the two muskrat skins nailed to the outside planking--spoils
of the mill-dam, a mile below.

Yes; he could paint here!

With a thrill of delight surging through him he rolled up his sleeves, tilted the bucket, filled
the basin with ice-cold water which Hank had drawn for him, a courtesy only shown a stranger
guest, and plunging in his hands and face, dashed the water over his head. Samanthy, meanwhile,
in sunbonnet and straight-up-and-down calico dress, had come out with the towel--half a salt-sack,
washed and rewashed to phenomenal softness (an ideal towel is a salt-sack to those who know).
Then came the rubbing until his flesh was aglow, and the parting of the wet hair with the help
of Hank's glass, and with a toss of a stray lock back from his forehead Oliver went in to breakfast.

It fills me with envy when I think of that first toilet of Oliver's! I too have had just such
morning dips --one in Como, with the great cypresses standing black against the glow of an
Italian dawn; another in the Lido at sunrise, my gondolier circling about me as I swam; still
a third in Stamboul, with the long slants of light piercing the gloom of the stone dome above
me--but oh, the smell of the pines and the great sweep of openness, with the mountains looking
down and the sun laughing, and the sparkle and joyousness of it all! Ah, what a lucky dog was
this Oliver!

And the days that followed! Each one a delight-- each one happier than the one before. The
sun seemed to soak into his blood; the strength of the great hemlocks with their giant uplifted
arms seemed to have found its way to his muscles. He grew stronger, more supple. He could follow
Hank all day now, tramping the brook or scaling the sides of Bald Face, its cheeks scarred
with thunderbolts. And with this joyous life there came a light into his eyes, a tone in his
voice, a spring and buoyancy in his step that brought him back to the days when he ran across
Kennedy Square and had no care for the day nor thought for the morrow. Before the week was
out he had covered half a dozen canvases with pictures of the house as he saw it that first
morning, bathed in the sunshine; of the brook; the sweep of the Notch, and two or three individual
trees that he had fallen in love with--a ragged birch in particular --a tramp of a birch with
its toes out of its shoes and its bark coat in tatters.

Before the second week had arrived he had sought the main stage-road and had begun work on
a big hemlock that stood sentinel over a turn in the highway.  There was a school-house in
the distance and a log-bridge under which the brook plunged. Here he settled himself for serious
work.

He was so engrossed that he had not noticed the school-children who had come up noiselessly
from behind and were looking in wonder at his drawings. Presently a child, who in her eagerness
had touched his shoulder, broke the stillness in apology.

"Say, Mister, there's a lady comes to school every day. She's a painter too, and drawed Sissy
Mathers."

Oliver glanced at the speaker and the group about her; wished them all good-morning and squeezed
a fresh tube on his palette. He was too much absorbed in his work for prolonged talk. The child,
emboldened  by his cheery greeting, began again, the others crowding closer. "She drawed the
bridge too, and me and Jennie Waters was sitting on the rail--she's awful nice."

Oliver looked up, smiling.

"What's her name?"

"I don't know. Teacher calls her Miss Margaret,  but there's more to it. She comes every year."

Oliver bent over his easel, drew out a line brush from the sheaf in his hand, caught up a bit
of yellow ochre from his palette and touched up the shadow of the birch. "All the women painters
must be Margarets,"  he said to himself. Then he fell to wondering  what had become of her
since the school closed. He had always felt uncomfortable over the night when he had defended
"the red-headed girl in blue gingham," as she was called by the students. She had placed him
in the wrong by misunderstanding  his reasons for serving her. The students had always looked
upon him after that as a quarrelsome  person, when he was only trying to protect a woman from
insult. He could not find it in his heart to blame her, but he wished that it had not happened.
As these thoughts filled his mind he became so absorbed that the children's good-by failed
to reach his ear.

That day Hank had brought him his luncheon-- two ears of hot corn in a tin bucket, four doughnuts
and an apple--the corn in the bottom of the bucket and the doughnuts and apple on top. He could
have walked home for his midday meal, for he was within sound of Samanthy's dinner-horn, but
he liked it better  this way.

Leaving his easel standing in the road, he had waved his hand in good-by to Hank, picked up
the bucket and had crept under the shadow of the bridge to eat his luncheon. He had finished
the corn, thrown the cobs to the fish, and was beginning on the doughnuts, when a step on the
planking above him caused him to look up. A girl in a tam-o'-shanter cap was leaning over the
rail. The sun was behind her, throwing her face into shadow--so blinding a light that Oliver
only caught the nimbus of fluffy hair that framed the dark spot of her head. Then came a voice
that sent a thrill of surprise through him.

"Why, Mr. Horn! Who would have thought of meeting you here?"

Oliver was on his feet in an instant--a half-eaten doughnut in one hand, his slouch hat in
the other. With this he was shading his eyes against the glare of the sun. He was still ignorant
of who had spoken to him.

"I beg your pardon, I--WHY, Miss Grant!" The words burst from his lips as if they had been
fired from a gun. "You here!"

"Yes, I live only twenty miles away, and I come here every year. Where are you staying?"

"At Pollard's."

"Why, that's the next clearing from mine. I'm at old Mrs. Taft's. Oh, please don't leave your
luncheon."

Oliver had bounded up the bank to a place beside her.

"How good it is to find you here. I am so glad." He WAS glad; he meant every word of it. "Mrs.
Mulligan said you lived up in the woods, but I had no idea it was in these mountains. Have
you had your luncheon?"

"No, not yet," and Margaret held up a basket. "Look!" and she raised the lid. "Elderberry pie,
two pieces of cake--"

"Good! and I have three doughnuts and an apple. I swallowed every grain of my hot corn like
a greedy Jack Horner, or you should have half of it. Come down under the bridge, it's so cool
there," and he caught her hand to help her down the bank.

She followed him willingly. She had seen him greet Fred, and Jack Bedford, and even the gentle
Professor with just such outbursts of affection, and she knew there was nothing especially
personal to her in it all. It was only his way of saying he was glad to see her.

Oliver laid the basket and tin can on a flat stone that the spring freshets had scoured clean;
spread his brown corduroy jacket on the pebbly beach beside it, and with a laugh and the mock
gesture of a courtier,  conducted her to the head of his improvised table. Margaret laughed
and returned the bow, stepping backward with the sweep of a great lady, and settled herself
beside him. In a moment she was on her knees bending over the brook, her hands in the water,
the tam-o'-shanter beside her. She must wash her hands, she said--"there was a whole lot of
chrome yellow on her fingers"--and she held them up with a laugh for Oliver's inspection. Oliver
watched her while she dried and bathed her shapely hands, smoothed the hair from her temples
and tightened the coil at the back of her head which held all this flood of gold in check,
then he threw himself down beside her, waiting until she should serve the feast.

As he told her of his trip up the valley and the effect it made upon him, and how he had never
dreamed of anything so beautiful, and how good the Pollards were; and what he had painted and
what he expected to paint; talking all the time with his thumb circling about as if it was
a bit of charcoal and the air it swept through but a sheet of Whatman's best, her critical
eye roamed over his figure and costume.  She had caught in her first swift, comprehensive 
glance from over the bridge-rail, the loose jacket and broad-brimmed planter's hat, around
which, with his love of color, Oliver had twisted a spray of  nasturtium blossoms and leaves
culled from the garden- patch that morning; but now that he was closer, she saw the color in
his cheeks and noticed, with a suppressed  smile, the slight mustache curling at the ends,
a new feature since the school had closed. She followed  too the curves of the broad chest
and the muscles outlined through his shirt. She had never thought him so strong and graceful,
nor so handsome. (The smile came to the surface now--an approving, admiring smile.) It was
the mountain-climbing, no doubt, she said to herself, and the open-air life that had wrought
the change.

With a laugh and toss of her head she unpacked her own basket and laid her contribution to
the feast on the flat rock--the pie on a green dock-leaf, which she reached over and pulled
from the water's edge, and the cake on the pink napkin--the only sign of city luxury in her
outlay. Oliver's eye meanwhile wandered over her figure and costume--a costume he had never
seen before on any living woman, certainly  not any woman around Kennedy Square.

Then his eyes sought her face. He noticed how brown she was--and how ruddy and healthy. How
red the lips--red as mountain-berries, and back of them big white teeth--white as peeled almonds.
He caught the line of the shoulders and the round of the full arm and tapering wrist, and the
small, well- shaped hand. "Queer clothes," he said to himself --"but the girl inside is all right."

Sitting under the shadow of the old bridge on the main highway, each weighed and balanced the
other, even as they talked aloud of the Academy School, and the pupils, and the dear old Professor
whom they both loved. They discussed the prospect of its doors being opened the next winter.
They talked of Mrs. Mulligan, and the old Italian who sold peanuts, and whose head Margaret
had painted; and of Jack Bedford and Fred Stone--the dearest fellow in the world--and last
year's pictures--especially Church's "Niagara," the sensation of the year, and Whittredge's
"Mountain Brook," and every other subject their two busy brains could rake and scrape up except
--and this subject, strange to say, was the only one really engrossing their two minds--the
overturning of Mr. Judson's body on the art-school floor, and the upsetting of Miss Grant's
mind for days thereafter. Once Oliver had unintentionally neared the danger- line by mentioning
the lithographer's name, but Margaret  had suddenly become interested in the movements  of
a chipmunk that had crept down for the crumbs of their luncheon, and with a woman's wit had
raised her finger to her lips to command silence lest he should be frightened off.

They painted no more that afternoon. When the shadows began to fall in the valley they started
up the road, picking up Oliver's easel and trap--both had stood unmolested and would have done
so all summer with perfect safety--and Oliver walked with Margaret as far as the bars that
led into Taft's  pasture. There they bade each other good-night,  Margaret promising to be
ready in the morning with her big easel and a fresh canvas, which Oliver was to carry, when
they would both go sketching together and make a long blessed summer day of it.

That night Oliver's upraised, restless hands felt the shingles over his head more than once
before he could get to sleep. He had not thought he could be any happier--but he was. Margaret's
unexpected appearance had restored to him that something which the old life at home had always
yielded. He was never really happy without the companionship of a woman, and this he had not
had since leaving Kennedy  Square. Those he had met on rare occasions in New York were either
too conventional or selfconscious,  or they seemed to be offended at his familiar  Southern
ways. This one was so sensible and companionable, and so appreciative and sympathetic. He felt
he could say anything to her and she would know what he meant. Perhaps, too, by and by she
would understand just why he had upset a man who had been rude to her.

Margaret lay awake, too--not long--not more than five minutes, perhaps. Long enough, however,
to wish she was not so sunburnt, and that she had brought her other dress and a pair of gloves
and a hat instead of this rough mountain-suit. Long enough, too, to recall Oliver's standing
beside her on the bridge with his big hat sweeping the ground, the color mounting to his cheeks,
and that joyous look in his eyes.

"Was he really glad to see me," she said to herself, as she dropped off into dreamland, "or
is it his way with all the women he meets? I wonder, too, if he protects them all?"

And so ended a day that always rang out in Oliver's  memory with a note of its own.

These dreams under the shingles! What would life be without them?

CHAPTER XIV

UNDER A BARK SLANT

The weeks that followed were rare ones for  Margaret and Oliver.

They painted all day and every day.

The little school-children posed for them, and so did the prim school-mistress, a girl of eighteen
in spectacles with hair cut short in the neck. And old Jonathan Gordon, the fisherman, posed,
too, with a string of trout in one hand and a long pole cut from a sapling in the other. And
once our two young comrades painted the mill-dam and the mill-- Oliver doing the first and
Margaret the last; and Baker, the miller, caught them at it, and insisted in all sincerity
that some of the money which the pictures brought must come to him, if the report were true
that painters did get money for pictures. "It's my mill, ain't it?--and I ain't give no permission
to take no part of it away. Hev I?"

They climbed the ravines, Margaret carrying the luncheon and Oliver the sketch-traps; they
built fires of birch-bark and roasted potatoes, or made tea in the little earthen pot that
Mrs. Taft loaned her. Or they waited for the stage in the early morning, and went half a dozen
miles down the valley to paint some waterfall Oliver had seen the day he drove up with Marvin,
or a particular glimpse of Moose Hillock from the covered bridge, or various shady nooks and
sunlit vistas that remained fastened in Oliver's mind, and the memory of which made him unhappy
until Margaret could enjoy them, too.

The fact that he and a woman whom he had known but a little while were roaming the woods together,
quite as a brother and sister might have done, never occurred to him. If it had it would have
made no difference, nor could he have understood why any barrier should have been put up between
them. He had been taking care of girls in that same way all his life. Every woman was a sister
to him so far as his reverent protection over her went. The traditions of Kennedy Square had
taught him this.

As the joyous weeks flew by, even the slight reserve  which had marked their earlier intercourse
began  to wear off. It was "Oliver" and "Margaret" now, and even "Ollie" and "Madge" when they
forgot themselves and each other in their work.

To Margaret this free and happy life together seemed natural enough. She had decided on the
day of their first meeting that Oliver's interest in her was due wholly to his love of companionship,
and not because of any special liking he might feel for her. Had she not seen him quite as
cordial and as friendly to the men he knew? Satisfied on this point, Oliver began to take the
place of a brother, or cousin, or some friend of her youth who loved another woman, perhaps,
and was, therefore, safe against all contingencies, while she gave herself up to the enjoyment
of that rare luxury--the rarest that comes to a woman--daily association with a man who could
be big and strong and sympathetic, and yet ask nothing  in return for what she gave him but
her companionship  and confidence.

In the joy of this new intercourse, and with his habit of trusting implicitly everyone whom
he loved --man, woman, or child--Oliver, long before the first month was over, had emptied
his heart to Margaret  as completely as he had ever done to Miss Clendenning.  He had told
her of Sue and of Miss Lavinia's  boudoir, and of Mr. Crocker and his pictures; and of his
poor father's struggles and his dear mother's determination to send him from home--not about
the mortgage, that was his mother's secret, not his own--and of the great receptions given
by his Uncle Tilghman, and of all the other wonderful doings  in Kennedy Square.

She had listened at first in astonishment, and then with impatience. Many of the things that
seemed so important to him were valueless in her more practical  eyes. Instead of a regime
which ennobled those who enjoyed its privileges, she saw only a slavish  devotion to worn-out
traditions, and a clannish provincialism which proved to her all the more clearly the narrow-mindedness
of the people who  sustained and defended them. So far as she could judge, the qualities that
she deemed necessary in the make-up of a robust life, instinct with purpose and accomplishment,
seemed to be entirely lacking in Kennedy Square formulas. She saw, too, with a certain undefined
pain, that Oliver's mind had been greatly warped by these influences. Mrs. Horn's domination
over him, strange to say, greatly disturbed  her; why, she could not tell. "She must be a proud,
aristocratic woman," she had said to herself after one of Oliver's outbursts of enthusiasm
over his mother; "wedded to patrician customs and with no consideration for anyone outside
of her class."

And yet none of these doubts and criticisms made the summer days less enjoyable.

One bright, beautiful morning when the sky was a turquoise, the air a breath of heaven, and
the brooks could be heard laughing clear out on the main road, Oliver and Margaret, who had
been separated for some days while she paid a visit to her family at home, started to find
a camp that Hank had built the winter before as a refuge while he was hunting deer. They had
reached a point in the forest where two paths met, when Margaret's quick ear caught the sound
of a human voice, and she stopped to listen.

"Quick--" she cried--"get behind these spruces, or he will see us and stop singing. It's old
Mr. Burton.  He is such a dear! He spends his summers here. I often meet him and he always
bows to me so politely, although he doesn't know me."

A man of sixty--bare-headed, dressed in a gray suit, with his collar and coat over his arm
and hands filled with wild-flowers, was passing leisurely along, singing at the top of his
voice. Once he stopped, and, bending over, picked a bunch of mountain-berries which he tucked
into a buttonhole of his flannel shirt, just before disappearing in a turn of the path.

Oliver looked after him for a moment. He had caught the look of sweet serenity on the idler's
face, and the air of joyousness that seemed to linger behind him like a perfume, and it filled
him with delight.

"There, Margaret! that's what I call a happy man. I'll wager you he has never done anything
all his life but that which he loved to do--just lives out here and throws his heart wide open
for every beautiful thing that can crowd into it. That's the kind of a man I want to be. Oh!
I'm so glad I saw him."

Margaret was silent. She was walking ahead, her staff in her hand; the fallen trunks and heavy
under- brush making it difficult for them to walk abreast.

"Do you think that he never had to work, to be able to enjoy himself as he does?" she asked
over her shoulder, with a toss of her head.

"Perhaps--but he loved what he was doing."

"No, he didn't--he hated it--hated it all his life." The tone carried a touch of defiance that
was new to Oliver. He stepped quickly after her, with a sudden desire to look into her face.
Ten minutes, at least, had passed during which he had seen only the back of her head.

Margaret heard his step behind her and quickened her own. Something was disturbing the joyousness
of our young Diana this lovely summer morning.

"What did the old fellow do for a living, Margaret?"  Oliver called, still trying to keep up
with Margaret's springing step.

"Sold lard and provisions, and over the counter, too," she answered, with a note almost of
exultation in her voice (she was thinking of Mrs. Horn and Kennedy Square). "Mrs. Taft knows
him and used to send him her bacon. He retired rich some years ago, and now he can sing all
day if he wants to."

It was Oliver's turn to be silent. The tones of Margaret's voice had hurt him. For some minutes
he made no reply. Then wheeling suddenly he sprang over a moss-covered trunk that blocked her
path, stepped in front of her, and laid his hand on her shoulder.

"Not offended, Margaret, are you?" he asked, looking earnestly into her eyes.

"No--what nonsense! Of course not. Why do you ask?"

"Well, somehow you spoke as if you were."

"No, I didn't; I only said how dear Mr. Burton was, and he IS. How silly you are! Come--we
will be late for the camp."

They both walked on in silence, now, he ahead this time, brushing aside the thick undergrowth
that blocked the path.

The exultant tones in her voice which had hurt her companion, and which had escaped her unconsciously,
still rang in her own ears. She felt ashamed of the outburst now as she watched him cutting
the branches ahead of her, and thought how gentle and tender he had always been to her and
how watchful over her comfort. She wondered at the cause of her frequent discontent. Then,
like an evil spirit that would not down, there arose in her mind, as she walked on, the picture
she had formed of Kennedy Square. She thought of his mother's imperious nature  absorbing all
the love of his heart and inspiring and guiding his every action and emotion; of the unpractical
father--a dreamer and an enthusiast, the worst possible example he could have; of the false
standards and class distinctions which had warped his early life and which were still dominating
him. With an abrupt gesture of impatience she stood still in the path and looked down upon
the ground. An angry flush suffused her face.

"What a stupid fool you are, Margaret Grant," she burst out impatiently. "What are Kennedy
Square and the whole Horn family to you?"

Oliver's halloo brought her to consciousness.

"Here's that slant, Margaret--oh, such a lovely spot! Hurry up."

"The slant" had been built between two great trees and stood on a little mound of earth surrounded
by beds of velvety green moss--huge green winding sheets, under which lay the bodies of many
giant pines and hemlocks. The shelter was made of bark and bedded down with boughs of sweet-balsam.
Outside,  on a birch sapling, supported by two forked sticks, hung a rusty kettle. Beneath
the rude spit, half-hidden by the growth of the summer, lay the embers of the abandoned camp-fires
that had warmed and comforted Hank and his companions the preceding  winter.

Oliver raked the charred embers from under the tangled vines that hid them, while Margaret
peeled the bark from a silver-birch for kindling. Soon a curl of blue smoke mounted heavenward,
hung suspended  over the tree-tops, and then drifted away in scarfs of silver haze dimming
the forms of the giant trunks.

Our young enthusiast watched the Diaz of a wood interior turn slowly into a Corot, and with
a cry of delight was about to unstrap his own and Margaret's sketching-kits, when the sun was
suddenly blotted out by a heavy cloud, and the quick gloom of a mountain-storm chilling the
sunlit vista to a dull slate gray settled over the forest. Oliver walked over to the brook
for a better view of the sky, and came back bounding over the moss-covered logs as he ran.
There was not a moment to lose if they would escape being drenched to the skin.

The outlook was really serious. Old Bald Face had not only lost his smile--a marvelously happy
one with the early sun upon his wrinkled countenance --but he had put on his judgment-cap of
gray clouds and had begun to thunder out his disapproval of everything about him. Moose Hillock
evidently heard the challenge, for he was answering back in the murky darkness. Soon a cold,
raw wind, which had been asleep in the hills for weeks, awoke with a snarl and started down
the gorge. Then the little leaves began to quiver, the big trees to groan, in their anxiety
not knowing what the will of the wind would be, and the merry little waves that had chased
each other all the morning over the sunny shallows of the brook, grew ashy pale as they looked
up into the angry  face of the Storm-God, and fled shivering to the shore.

Oliver whipped out his knife, stripped the heavy outer bark from a white birch, and before
the dashing  rain could catch up with the wind, had repaired the slant so as to make it water-tight--Hank
had taught him this--then he started another great fire in front of the slant and threw fresh
balsam boughs on the bed that had rested Hank's tired limbs, and he and Margaret crept in and
were secure.

The equanimity of Margaret's temper, temporarily disturbed by her vivid misconception of Kennedy
Square, was restored. The dry shelter, the warm fire, the sense of escape from the elements,
all filled her heart with gladness. Never since the day she met him on the bridge had she been
so happy. Again, as when Oliver championed her in the old Academy school-room, there stole
over her a vague sense of pleasure in being protected.

"Isn't it jolly!" she said as she sat hunched up beside him. "I'm as dry as a bone, not a drop
on me."

Oliver was even more buoyant. There was something  irresistibly cosey and comfortable in the
shelter which he had provided for her--something of warmth and companionship and rest. But
more intensely  enjoyable than all was the thought that he was taking care of a woman for the
first time in his life, as it seemed to him. And in a house of his own making, and in a place,
too, of his own choosing, surrounded by the big trees that he loved. He had even outwitted
the elements--the wind and the rain and the chill--in her defence. Old Moose Hillock could
bellow now and White Face roar, and the wind and rain vent their wrath, but Margaret, close
beside him, would still be warm and dry and safe.

By this time she had hung her tam-o'-shanter and jacket on a nail that she had found in the
bark over her head, and was arranging her hair.

"It's just like life, Oliver, isn't it?" she said, as she tightened the coil in her neck. "All
we want, after all, is a place to get into out of the storm and wet, not a big place, either."

"What kind of a place?" He was on his knees digging a little trench with his knife, piling
up the moist earth in miniature embankments, so that the dripping from the roof would not spatter
this Princess  of his whom he had saved from the tempest outside.

"Oh, any kind of a place if you have people you're fond of. I'd love a real studio somewhere,
and a few things hung about--some old Delft and one or two bits of stuff--and somebody to take
care of me."

Oliver shifted his pipe in his mouth and looked up. Would she, with all her independence, really
like to have someone take care of her? He had seen no evidence of it.

"Who?" he asked. He had never heard her mention anybody's name--but then she had not told him
everything;

He had dropped his eyes again, finishing the drain and flattening the boughs under her, to
make the seat the easier.

"Oh, some old woman, perhaps, like dear old Mrs. Mulligan." There was no coquetry in her tone.
She was speaking truthfully out of her heart.

"Anything more?" Oliver's voice had lost its buoyancy now. The pipe was upside down, the ashes
falling on his shirt.

"Yes--lots of portraits to paint."

"And a medal at the Salon?" asked Oliver, brushing  off the waste of his pipe from his coat-sleeve.

"Yes, I don't mind, if my pictures deserve it," and she looked at him quizzically, while a
sudden flash of humor lightened up her face. "What would you want, Mr. Happy-go-lucky, if you
had your wish?"

"I, Madge, dear?" he exclaimed, with a sudden outburst of tenderness, raising his body erect
and looking earnestly into her eyes, which were now within a hand's breadth of his own. She
winced a little, but it did not offend her, nor did she move an inch. "Oh, I don't know what
I want. What I want, I suppose, is what I shall never have, little girl."

She wasn't his little girl, or anybody else's, she thought to herself--she was firmly convinced
of that fact. It was only one of his terms of endearment. He had them for everybody--even for
Hank and for Mrs. Taft--whom he called "Taffy," and who loved to hear him say it, and she old
enough to be his grandmother! She stole a look into his face. There was a cloud over it, a
slight knitting of the brows, and a pained expression about the mouth that were new to her.

"I'd like to be a painter," he continued, "but mother would never consent." As be spoke, he
sank back from her slowly, his knees still bent under him. Then be added, with a sigh, "She
wouldn't think it respectable. Anything but a painter, she says."

Margaret looked out through the forest and watched a woodpecker at work on the dry side of
a hollow trunk, the side protected from the driving rain.

"And you would give up your career because she wants it? How do you know she's right about
it? And who's to suffer if she's wrong? Be a painter, Oliver, if you want to! Your mother can't
coddle you up forever! No mother should. Do what you can do best, and to please yourself, not
somebody else," and then she laughed lightly as if to break the force of her words.

Oliver looked at her in indignation that anyone-- even Margaret--should speak so of his mother.
It was the first time in all his life that he had heard her name mentioned without the profound
reverence it deserved. Then a sense of the injustice of her words took possession of him, as
the solemn compact  he had made with his mother not to be a burden  on her while the mortgage
was unpaid, rose in his mind. This thought and Margaret's laugh softened  any hurt her words
had given him, although the lesson that they were intended to teach lingered in his memory
for many days thereafter.

"You would not talk that way, Madge, if you knew my dear mother," he said, quietly. "There
is nothing in her life she loves better than me. She doesn't want me to be a painter because--"
He stopped, fearing she might not understand his answer.

"Go on--why not?" The laugh had faded out of her voice now, and a tone almost of defiance had
taken its place.

"She says it is not the profession of a gentleman,"  he answered, sadly. "I do not agree with
her, but she thinks so, and nothing can shake her."

"If those are her opinions, I wonder what she would think of ME?" There was a slight irritation
in her voice--somehow she always became irritable when Oliver spoke of his mother. She was
ashamed of it, but it was true.

All his anger was gone now. Whatever opinion the world might have on any number of things there
could be but one opinion of Madge. "She would LOVE you, little girl," he burst out as he laid
his hand on her arm--the first time he had ever touched her with any show of affection. "You'd
make her love you. She never saw anybody like you before, and she never will. That you are
an artist wouldn't make any difference. It's not the same with you. You're a woman."

The girl's eyes again sought the woodpecker. It was stabbing away with all its might, driving
its beak far into the yielding bark. It seemed in some way to represent her own mood. After
a moment's thought she said thoughtfully as she rested her head on the edge of the slant:

"Ollie, what is a gentleman?" She knew, she thought, but she wanted him to define it.

"My father is one," he said, positively, "--and so is yours," and he looked inquiringly into
her face.

"That depends on your standard. I don't know your father, but I do mine, and from what you
have told me about yours I think they are about as different  as two men can be. Answer my
question--what is a gentleman?" She was leaning over a little, and tucking a chip under her
toes to keep the water away from her shoes. Her eyes sought his again.

"A gentleman, Madge--why, you know what a gentleman is. He is a man well born, well educated,
and well bred. That's the standard at home --at least, that's my mother's. Father's standard
is the same, only he puts it in a different way. He says a gentleman is a man who tolerates
other people's  mistakes and who sympathizes with other people's  troubles."

"Anything else?" She was searching his face now. There were some things she wanted to settle
in her own mind.

"I don't think of anything else, Madge, dear--do you?" He was really dismissing the question.
His thoughts were on something else--the way her hair curled from under her worsted cap and
the way her pink ears nestled close to her head, especially the  little indents at each corner
of her mouth. He liked their modelling.

"And so according to your mother's and father's ideas, and those of all your aristocratic people
at home, Hank here could not be a gentleman if he tried?"

The idea was new to Oliver. He had become conscious  now. What had gotten into Margaret to-day!

"Hank?--no, certainly not. How could he?"

"By BEING a gentleman, Mr. Aristocrat. Not in clothes, mind you--nor money, nor furniture,
nor wines, nor carriages, but in HEART. Think a moment, Ollie," and her eyes snapped. "Hank
finds a robin that has tumbled out of its nest, and spends half a day putting it back. Hank
follows you up the brook and sees you try to throw a fly into a pool, and he knows just how
awkwardly you do it, for he's the best fisherman  in the woods--and yet you never see a smile
cross his face, nor does he ever speak of it behind your back--not even to me. Hank walks across
Moose Hillock to find old Jonathan Gordon to tell him he has some big trout in Loon Pond, so
that the old man can have the fun of catching them and selling them afterward to the new hotel
in the Notch. He has walked twenty-four miles when he gets back. Do these things make Hank
a gentleman, or not?"

"Then you don't believe in Sir Walter Raleigh, Miss Democrat, simply because he was a lord?"

"Yes--but I always thought he wore his old cloak that day on purpose, so he could be made an
earl." And a ripple of laughter escaped her lips.

Oliver laughed too, sprang to his feet, and held out his hands so as to lift her up. None of
these fine-drawn distinctions really interested him--certainly  not on this day, when he was
so happy. Why, he wondered, should she want to discuss theories and beliefs and creeds, with
the beautiful forest all about and the sky breaking overhead?

"Well, you've walked over mine many a time, Miss Queen Elizabeth, and you haven't decorated
me yet, nor made me an earl nor anything else for it, and I'm not going to forgive you either,"
and he rose to his feet. "Look! Madge, look!" he cried, and sprang out into the path, pointing
to the sunshine  bursting through the trees--the storm had passed as suddenly as it had come.
"Isn't it glorious!  Come here quick! Don't wait a minute. I should try to get that with Naples
yellow and a little chrome--what do you think?" he asked when she stood beside him, half closing
his eyes, to get the effect the better.

Margaret looked at him curiously for a moment. She did not answer. "I cannot fasten his mind
on anything in which I am interested," she said to herself,  with a sigh, "nor shall I ever
overcome these prejudices which seem to be part of his very life."

She paused a moment and an expression of pain passed over her face.

"Pale cadmium would be better," she said, quietly,  with a touch of indifference in her tone,
and led the way out of the forest to the main road.

CHAPTER XV

MRS. TAFT'S FRONT PORCH

The autumn fires were being kindled on the mountains --fires of maple, oak, and birch. Along
the leaf-strewn roads the sumach blazed scarlet, and over the rude stone fences blood-red lines
of fire  followed the trend of leaf and vine. Golden pumpkins  lay in the furrows of the corn;
showers of apples carpeted the grass of the orchards; the crows in straight lines, and the
busy squirrels worked from dawn till dark.

Over all settled the requiem haze of the dead summer, blurring the Notch and softening Moose
Hillock to a film of gray against the pale sky.

It had been a summer of very great sweetness and charm--the happiest of Oliver's life. He had
found that he could do fairly well the things that he liked to do best; that the technical
difficulties that had  confronted him when he began to paint were being  surmounted as the
weeks went by, and that the thing that had always been a pain to him had now become a pleasure--pain,
because, try as he might, the quality  of the result was always below his hopes; a pleasure,
because some bit of bark, perhaps, or glint of light on moss-covered rock, or tender vista
had at last stood out on his canvas with every tone of color true.

Only a painter can understand what all this meant to Oliver; only an out-of-door painter, really.
The "studio-man" who reproduces an old study which years before has inspired him, or who evolves
a  composition from his inner consciousness, has no such thrills over his work. He may, perhaps,
have other sensations, but they will lack the spontaneous outburst  of enthusiasm over the
old sketch.

And how glorious are the memories!

The victorious painter has been weeks over these same trees that have baffled him; he has painted
them on gray days and sunny days; in the morning, at noon, and in the gloaming. He has loved
their texture and the thousand little lights and darks; the sparkle of the black, green, or
gray moss, and the delicate tones that played up and down their stalwart  trunks. He has toiled
in the heat of the day, his nerves on edge, and sometimes great drops of sweat on his troubled
forehead. Now and then he has sprung from his seat for a farther-away look at his sketch. With
a sigh and a heart bowed down (oh, how desolate are these hours!) he has noted how wooden and
commonplace and mean and despicable his work was--what an insult he has cast upon the beautiful
yellow birch, this outdoor, motionless, old model that has stood so patiently before him, posing
all day without moving; its big arms above its head its leaves and branches stock-still to
make it all the easier for him.

Suddenly in all this depression, an inspiration has entered his dull brain--he will use burnt
umber in stead of Vandyke brown for the bark! or light chrome and indigo instead of yellow
ochre and black for the green!

Presto! Ah, that's like it! Another pat, and another, and still one more!

How quickly now the canvas loses its pasty mediocrity.  How soon the paint and the brush-marks
and the niggly little touches fade away and the THING ITSELF comes out and says "How do you
do?" and that it is so glad to see him, and that it has been lurking behind these colors all
day, trying to make his acquaintance, and he would have none of it. What good friends he and
the sketch have become now; how proud he is of it, and of possessing it and of CREATING it!
Then little quivery-quavers go creeping  up and down his spine and away out to his fingertips;
and he KNOWS that he has something really GOOD.

He carries it home in his hand, oh, so carefully (he strapped its predecessor on his back yesterday
without  caring), and a dozen times he stops to look at its dear face, propping it against
a stump for a better light, just to see if he had not been mistaken after all. He can hardly
wait until it is dark enough to see how it looks by gas-light, or candle-light, or  kerosene,
or whatever else he may have in his quarters. Years after, the dear old thing is still hanging
on his studio wall. He has never sold it nor given it away. He could not--it was too valuable,
too constantly giving him good advice and showing him what the thing WAS. Not what he thought
it was, or hoped it was, or would like it to be, but what it WAS.

Yes, there may be triumphs that come to men digging away on the dull highway of life--triumphs
in business; in politics; in discovery; in law; medicine,  and science. To each and every profession
and pursuit there must come, and does come, a time when a rush of uncontrollable feeling surges
through the victor's soul, crowning long hours of work, but they are as dry ashes to a thirsty
man compared to the boundless ecstasy a painter feels when, with a becaked  palette, some half-dried
tubes of color, and a few worn-out, ragged brushes, he compels a six-by- nine canvas to glow
with life and truth.

All this Oliver knew and felt. The work of the summer, attended at first with a certain sense
of  disappointment, had, during the last few weeks of sojourn,  as his touch grew surer, not
only become a positive pleasure to him, but had produced an exaltation  that had kept our young
gentleman walking on clouds most of the time, his head in the blue ether.

Margaret's nice sense of color and correct eye had hastened this result. She could grasp at
the first glance the masses of light and shade, giving each its proper value in the composition.
She and Oliver. really studied out their compositions together before either one set a palette,
a most desirable practice, by the way, not only for tyros, but for Academicians.

This relying upon Margaret's judgment had become  a habit with Oliver. He not only consulted
her about his canvases, but about everything else that concerned him. He had never formulated
in his mind what this kind of companionship meant to him (we never do when we are in the midst
of it), nor had he ever considered what would become of him when the summer was over, and the
dream would end, and they each would return to the customary dulness of life; a life where
there would be no blue ether nor clouds, nor vanishing points, nor values, nor tones, nor anything
else that had made their heaven of a summer so happy.

They had both lived in this paradise for weeks without once bringing themselves to believe
it could ever end (why do not such episodes last forever?) when Oliver awoke one morning to
the fact that the fatal day of their separation would be upon him in a week's time or less.
Margaret, with her more practical mind, had seen farther ahead than Oliver, and her laugh,
in consequence, had been less spontaneous  of late, and her interest in her work and in Oliver's
less intense. She was overpowered by another  sensation; she had been thinking of the day,
now so near, when the old stage would drive up to Mrs. Taft's pasture-gate, and her small trunk
and trap would be carried down on Hank's back and tumbled  in, and she would go back alone
to duty and the prosaic life of a New England village.

Neither of them supposed that it was anything else but the grief of parting that afflicted
them, until there came a memorable autumn night--a night that sometimes  comes to the blessed!--when
the moon swam in the wide sky, breasting the soft white clouds, and when Oliver and Margaret
sat together on the porch of Mrs. Taft's cottage--he on the steps at her feet, she leaning
against the railing, the moonlight full upon her face.

They had been there since sunset. They had known all day what was in each other's mind, but
they had avoided discussing it. Now they must face it.

"You go to-morrow, Madge?" Oliver asked. He knew she did. He spoke as if announcing a fact.

"Yes."

The shrill cry of a loon, like the cry of a child in pain, sifted down the ravine from the
lake above and died away among the pines soughing in the night- wind. Oliver paused for a moment
to listen, and went on:

"I don't want you to go. I don't know what I am going to do without you, Madge," he said with
a long indrawn sigh.

"You are coming to us at Brookfield, you know, on your way back to New York. That is some thing."
She glanced at him with a slightly anxious look in her eyes, as if waiting for his answer to
reassure her.

He rose from his seat and began pacing the gravel. Now and then he would stop, flick a pebble
from its bed with his foot, and walk on. She heard the sound of his steps, but she did not
look at him, even when he stopped abruptly in front of her.

"Yes, I know, but--that will only make it worse." He was leaning over her now, one foot on
the steps. "It tears me all to pieces when I think this is our last night. We've had such a
good time all summer.  You don't want to go home, do you?"

"No--I'd rather stay." The words came slowly, as if it gave her pain to utter them.

"Well--stay, then," he answered with some animation.  "What difference does a few days makes?
Let us have another week. We haven't been over to Bog Eddy yet; please stay, Madge."

"No, I must go, Ollie."

"But we'll be so happy, little girl."

"Life is not only being happy, Ollie. It's very real sometimes. It is to me--" and a faint
sigh escaped her.

"Well, but why make it real to-morrow? Let us make it real next week, not now."

"It would be just as hard for you next week. Why postpone it?" She was looking at him now,
watching his face closely.

Her answer seemed to hurt him. With an impatient  gesture he straightened himself, turned as
if to resume his walk, and then, pushing away the end of her skirt, sat down beside her.

"I don't understand your theories, Madge, and I'm not going to discuss them. I don't want to
talk of any such things; I'm too unhappy to-night. When I look ahead and think that if the
Academy should not open, you wouldn't come back at all, and that I might not see you for months,
I'm all broken up. What am I going to do without you, Madge?" His voice was quivering, and
a note of pain ran through it.

"Oh, you will have your work--you'll do just what you did before I came up." She was holding
herself in by main strength; why, she could not tell --fighting an almost irresistible impulse
to hide her face on his breast and cry.

"What good will that do me when you are gone?" he burst out, with a quick toss of his head
and a  certain bitterness in his tone.

"Well, but you were very happy before you saw me."

Again the cry of the loon came down the ravine. He turned and with one of his quick, impatient
gestures that she knew so well, put his hand on her shoulder.

"Stop, Madge, stop! Don't talk that way. I can't stand it. Look at me!" The pain had become
unbearable now. "You've got to listen. I can't keep it back, and I won't. I never met anybody
that I loved as I do you. I didn't think so at first. I never thought I could think so, but
it's true. You are not my sweetheart nor my friend, nor my companion, nor anything else that
ever came into my life. You are my very breath, my soul, my being.  I never want you to leave
me. I should never have another happy day if I thought this was to end our life. I laid awake
half the night trying to straighten it out, and I can't, and there's no  straightening it out
and never will be unless you love me. Oh, Madge! Madge! Don't turn away from me. Let me be
part of you--part of everything you do --and are--and will be."

He caught her hand in his warm palm and laid his cheek upon it. Still holding it fast he raised
his head, laid his other hand upon her hair, smoothing it softly, and looked long and earnestly
into her eyes as if searching for something hidden in their depths. Then, in a voice of infinite
tenderness, he said:

"Madge, darling! Tell me true--could you ever love me?"

She sat still, her eyes fixed on his, her hand nestling in his grasp. Then slowly and carefully,
one at a time, she loosened with her other hand the fingers that lay upon her hair, held them
for an  instant in her own, bent her head and touched them with her lips.

CHAPTER XVI

SOME DAYS AT BROOKFIELD FARM

Brookfield village lay in a great wide meadow through which strayed one of Moose Hillock's
lost brooks--a brook tired out with leaping from bowlder to bowlder and taking headers into
deep pools, and plunging down between narrow walls of rock. Here in the meadow it caught its
breath and rested, idling along, stopping to bathe a clump of willows; whispering to the shallows;
laughing gently with another brook that had locked arms with it, the two gossiping together
under their breath as they floated on through the tall grasses fringing the banks, or circled
about the lily-pads growing in the eddies. In the middle of the meadow, just where two white
ribbons of roads crossed, was a clump of trees pierced by a church-spire. Outside of this bower
of green--a darker green than the velvet meadow- grass about it--glistened the roofs and windows
of the village houses.
