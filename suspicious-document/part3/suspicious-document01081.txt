"Poor Lolo," said Mrs. Wood, going up to her. "Joe is a good dog, and not like Bruno. He won't
hurt you."

I wagged myself about a little, and looked kindly at her, but she did nothing but say bad words
to me. It was weeks and weeks before I made friends with that cat. She was a young thing, and
had known only one dog, and he was a bad one, so she supposed all dogs were like him.

There was a number of rooms opening off the hall, and one of them was the dining room where
they had tea. I lay on a rug outside the door and watched them. There was a small table spread
with a white cloth, and it had pretty dishes and glassware on it, and a good many different
kinds of things to eat. A little French girl, called Adele, kept coming and going from the
kitchen to give them hot cakes, and fried eggs, and hot coffee. As soon as they finished their
tea, Mrs. Wood gave me one of the best meals that I ever had in my life.

CHAPTER XVII MR. WOOD AND HIS HORSES

THE morning after we arrived in Riverdale, I was up very early and walking around the house.
I slept in the woodshed, and could run outdoors whenever I liked.

The woodshed was at the back of the house and near it was the tool shed. Then there was a carriage
house, and a plank walk leading to the barnyard.

I ran up this walk, and looked into the first building I came to. It was the horse stable.
A door stood open, and the morning sun was glancing in. There were several horses there, some
with their heads toward me, and some with their tails. I saw that instead of being tied up,
there were gates outside their stalls, and they could stand in any way they liked.

There was a man moving about at the other end of the stable, and long before he saw me, I knew
that it was Mr. Wood. What a nice, clean stable he had! There was always a foul smell coming
out of Jenkins's stable, but here the air seemed as pure inside as outside. There was a number
of little gratings in the wall to let in the fresh air, and they were so placed that drafts
would not blow on the horses. Mr. Wood was going from one horse to another, giving them hay,
and talking to them in a cheerful voice. At last he spied me, and cried out, "The top of the
morning to you, Joe! You are up early. Don't come too near the horses, good dog," as I walked
in beside him; "they might think you are another Bruno, and give you a sly bite or kick. I
should have shot him long ago. 'Tis hard to make a good dog suffer for a bad one, but that's
the way of the world. Well, old fellow, what do you think of my horse stable? Pretty fair,
isn't it?" And Mr. Wood went on talking to me as he fed and groomed his horses, till I soon
found out that his chief pride was in them.

I like to have human beings talk to me. Mr. Morris often reads his sermons to me, and Miss
Laura tells me secrets that I don't think she would tell to any one else.

I watched Mr. Wood carefully, while he groomed a huge, gray cart-horse, that he called Dutchman.
He took a brush in his right hand, and a curry-comb in his left, and he curried and brushed
every part of the horse's skin, and afterward wiped him with a cloth. "A good grooming is equal
to two quarts of oats, Joe," he said to me.

Then he stooped down and examined the horse's hoofs. "Your shoes are too heavy, Dutchman,"
he said; "but that pig-headed blacksmith thinks he knows more about horses than I do. 'Don't
cut the sole nor the frog,' I say to him. 'Don't pare the hoof so much, and don't rasp it;
and fit your shoe to the foot, and not the foot to the shoe,' and he looks as if he wanted
to say, 'Mind your own business.' We'll not go to him again. ''Tis hard to teach an old dog
new tricks.' I got you to work for me, not to wear out your strength in lifting about his weighty
shoes."

Mr. Wood stopped talking for a few minutes, and whistled a tune. Then he began again. "I've
made a study of horses, Joe. Over forty years I've studied them, and it's my opinion that the
average horse knows more than the average man that drives him. When I think of the stupid fools
that are goading patient horses about, beating them and misunderstanding them, and thinking
they are only clods of earth with a little life in them, I'd like to take their horses out
of the shafts and harness them in, and I'd trot them off at a pace, and slash them, and jerk
them, till I guess they'd come out with a little less patience than the animal does.

"Look at this Dutchman see the size of him. You'd think he hadn't any more nerves than a bit
of granite. Yet he's got a skin as sensitive as a girl's. See how he quivers if I run the curry
comb too harshly over him. The idiot I got him from didn't know what was the matter with him.
He'd bought him for a reliable horse, and there he was, kicking and stamping whenever the boy
went near him. 'Your boy's got too heavy a hand, Deacon Jones,' said I, when he described the
horse's actions to me. 'You may depend upon it, a four-legged creature, unlike a two-legged
one, has a reason for everything he does.' 'But he's only a draught horse,' said Deacon Jones.
'Draught horse or no draught horse,' said I, 'you're describing a horse with a tender skin
to me, and I don't care if he's as big as an elephant.' Well, the old man grumbled and said
he didn't want any thoroughbred airs in his stable, so I bought you, didn't I, Dutchman?" and
Mr. Wood stroked him kindly and went to the next stall.

In each stall was a small tank of water with a sliding cover, and I found out afterward that
these covers were put on when a horse came in too heated to have a drink. You had we was not worse option

 We're thinking too
much about educating the mind, and forgetting about the heart and soul. So I say now, while
we've got all our future population in our schools, saints and sinners, good people and bad
people, let us try to slip in something between the geography, and history, and grammar that
will go a little deeper, and touch them so much, that when they are grown up and go out in
the world, they will carry with them lessons of love and good-will to men.

"A little child is such a tender thing. You can bend it anyway you like. Speaking of this heart
education of children, as set over against mind education, I see that many school-teachers
say that there is nothing better than to give them lessons on kindness to animals. Children
who are taught to love and protect dumb creature, will be kind to their fellow-men when they
grow up."

I was very much pleased with this talk between Mrs. Wood and Miss Laura, and kept close to
them so that I would not miss a word.

As we went along, houses began to appear here and there, set back from the road among the trees.
Soon they got quite close together, and I saw some shops.

This was the village of Riverdale, and nearly all the buildings were along this winding street.
The river was away back of the village. We had already driven there several times.

We passed the school on our way. It was a square, white building, standing in the middle of
a large yard. Boys and girls, with their arms full of books, were hurrying down the steps and
coming into the street. Two quite big boys came behind us, and Mrs. Wood turned around and
spoke to them, and asked if they were going to the Band of Mercy.

"Oh, yes, ma'am," said the younger one "I've got a recitation, don't you remember?"

"Yes, yes; excuse me for forgetting," said Mrs. Wood, with her jolly laugh. "And here are Dolly,
and Jennie, and Martha," she went on, as some little girls came running out of a house that
we were passing.

The little girls joined us and looked so hard at my head and stump of a tail, and my fine collar,
that I felt quite shy, and walked with my head against Miss Laura's dress.

She stooped down and patted me, and then I felt as if I didn't care how much they stared. Miss
Laura never forgot me. No matter how earnestly she was talking, or playing a game, or doing
anything, she always stopped occasionally to give me word or look, to show that she knew I
was near.

Mrs. Wood paused in front of a building on the main street. A great many boys and girls were
going in, and we went with them. We found ourselves in a large room, with a platform at one
end of it. There were some chairs on this platform and a small table.

A boy stood by this table with his hand on a bell. Presently he rang it, and then every one
kept still. Mrs. Wood whispered to Miss Laura that this boy was the president of the band,
and the young man with the pale face and curly hair who sat in front of him was Mr. Maxwell,
the artist's son, who had formed this Band of Mercy.

The lad who presided had a ringing, pleasant voice. He said they would begin their meeting
by singing a hymn. There was an organ near the platform and a young girl played on it, while
all the other boys and girls stood up, and sang very sweetly and clearly.

After they had sung the hymn, the president asked for the report of their last meeting.

A little girl, blushing and hanging her head, came forward, and read what was written on a
paper that she held in her hand.

The president made some remarks after she had finished, and then every one had to vote. It
was just like a meeting of grown people, and I was surprised to see how good those children
were. They did not frolic nor laugh, but all seemed sober and listened attentively.

After the voting was over, the president called upon John Turner to give a recitation This
was the boy whom we saw on the way there. He walked up to the platform, made a bow, and said
that he had learned two stories for his recitation, out of the paper, "Dumb Animals." One story
was about a horse, and the other was about a dog, and he thought that they were two of the
best animal stories on record. He would tell the horse story first.

"A man in Missouri had to go to Nebraska to see about some land. He went on horseback, on a
horse that he had trained himself, and that came at his whistle like a dog. On getting into
Nebraska, he came to a place where there were two roads. One went by a river, and the other
went over the hill. The man saw that the travel went over the hill, but thought he'd take the
river road. He didn't know that there was a quicksand across it, and that people couldn't use
it in spring and summer. There used to be a sign board to tell strangers about it, but it had
been taken away. The man got off his horse to let him graze, and walked along till he got so
far ahead of the horse that he had to sit down and wait for him. Suddenly he found that he
was on a quicksand. His feet had sunk in the sand, and he could not get them out. He threw
himself down, and whistled for his horse, and shouted for help, but no one came. We sometimes, when he would

 Dr. Fairchild used
to speak kindly to him, and throw out bits of meat, and now when he comes, Tiger follows behind
and wags his tail. Now, give me a kiss."

The girl had to give her a kiss, right up there before every one, and what a stamping the boys
made. The larger girl blushed and hurried back to her seat, with the child clinging to her hand.

There was one more story, about a brave Newfoundland dog, that saved eight lives by swimming
out to a wrecked sailing vessel, and getting a rope by which the men came ashore, and then
a lad got up whom they all greeted with cheers, and cries of, "The Poet! the Poet!" I didn't
know what they meant, till Mrs. Wood whispered to Miss Laura that he was a boy who made rhymes,
and the children had rather hear him speak than any one else in the room.

He had a snub nose and freckles, and I think he was the plainest boy there, but that didn't
matter, if the other children loved him. He sauntered up to the front, with his hands behind
his back, and a very grand manner.

"The beautiful poetry recited here to-day," he drawled, "put some verses in my mind that I
never had till I came here to-day." Every one present cheered wildly, and he began in a sing
song voice:

     "I am a Band of Mercy boy,
       I would not hurt a fly,
     I always speak to dogs and cats,
       When'er I pass them by.

     "I always let the birdies sing,
       I never throw a stone,
     I always give a hungry dog
       A nice, fat, meaty bone.

     "I wouldn't drive a bob-tailed horse,
       Nor hurry up a cow,
     I"

Then he forgot the rest. The boys and girls were so sorry. They called out, "Pig," "Goat,"
"Calf," "Sheep," "Hens," "Ducks," and all the other animals' names they could think of, but
none of them was right, and as the boy had just made up the poetry, no one knew what the next
could be. He stood for a long time staring at the ceiling, then he said, "I guess I'll have
to give it up."

The children looked dreadfully disappointed. "Perhaps you will remember it by our next meeting,"
said the president, anxiously.

"Possibly," said the boy, "but probably not. I think it is gone forever." And he went to his seat.

The next thing was to call for new members. Miss Laura got up and said she would like to join
their Band of Mercy. I followed her up to the platform, while they pinned a little badge on
her, and every one laughed at me. Then they sang, "God Bless our Native Land," and the president
told us that we might all go home.

It seemed to me a lovely thing for those children to meet together to talk about kindness to
animals. They all had bright and good faces, and many of them stopped to pat me as I came out.
One little girl gave me a biscuit from her school bag.

Mrs. Wood waited at the door till Mr. Maxwell came limping out on his crutches. She introduced
him to Miss Laura, and asked him if he wouldn't go and take tea with them. He said he would
be very happy to do so, and then Mrs. Wood laughed; and asked him if he hadn't better empty
his pockets first. She didn't want a little toad jumping over her tea table, as one did the
last time he was there.

I was very much taken with Mr. Maxwell. He seemed so bright and happy, in spite of his lameness,
which kept him from running about like other young men. He looked a little older than Miss
Laura, and one day, a week or two later, when they were sitting on the veranda, I heard him
tell her that he was just nineteen. He told her, too, that his lameness made him love animals.
They never laughed at him, or slighted him, or got impatient, because he could not walk quickly.
They were always good to him, and he said he loved all animals while he liked very few people.

On this day as he was limping along, he said to Mrs. Wood: "I am getting more absent-minded
every day. Have you heard of my latest escapade?"

"No," she said.

"I am glad," he replied. "I was afraid that it would be all over the village by this time.
I went to church last Sunday with my poor guinea pig in my pocket. He hasn't been well, and
I was attending to him before church, and put him in there to get warm, and forgot about him.
Unfortunately I was late, and the back seats were all full, so I had to sit farther up than
I usually do. During the first hymn I happened to strike Piggy against the side of the seat.
Such an ear-splitting squeal as he set up. It sounded as if I was murdering him. The people
stared and stared, and I had to leave the church, overwhelmed with confusion."

Mrs. Wood and Miss Laura laughed, and then they got talking about other matters that were not
interesting to me, so I did not listen. But I kept close to Miss Laura, for I was afraid that
green thing might hurt her. I wondered very much what its name was. I don't think I should
have feared it so much if I had known what it was.

"There's something the matter with Joe," said Miss Laura, when we got into the lane. "What
is it, dear old fellow?" She put down her little hand, and I licked it, and wished so much
that I could speak.

Sometimes I wish very much that I had the gift of speech, and then at other times I see how
little it would profit me, and how many foolish things I should often say. And I don't believe
human beings would love animals as well, if they could speak.

When we reached the house, we got a joyful surprise. There was a trunk standing on the veranda,
and as soon as Mrs. Wood saw it, she gave a little shriek: "My dear boy!"

Mr. Harry was there, sure enough, and stepped out through the open door. He took his mother
in his arms and kissed her, then he shook hands with Miss Laura and Mr. Maxwell, who seemed
to be an old friend of his. They all sat down on the veranda and talked, and I lay at Miss
Laura's feet and looked at Mr. Harry. He was such a handsome young man, and had such a noble
face. He was older and graver looking than when I saw him last, and he had a light, brown mustache
that he did not have when he was in Fairport.

He seemed very fond of his mother and of Miss Laura, and however grave his face might be when
he was looking at Mr. Maxwell, it always lighted up when he turned to them. "What dog is that?"
he said at last, with a puzzled face, and pointing to me.

"Why, Harry," exclaimed Miss Laura, "don't you know Beautiful Joe, that you rescued from that
wretched milkman?"

"Is it possible," he said, "that this well-conditioned creature is the bundle of dirty skin
and bones that we nursed in Fairport? Come here, sir. Do you remember me?"

Indeed I did remember him, and I licked his hands and looked up gratefully into his face. "You're
almost handsome now," he said, caressing me with a firm, kind hand, "and of a solid build,
too. You look like a fighter but I suppose you wouldn't let him fight, even if he wanted to,
Laura," and he smiled and glanced at her.

"No," she said; "I don't think I should; but he can fight when the occasion requires it." And
she told him about our night with Jenkins.

All the time she was speaking, Mr. Harry held me by the paws, and stroked my body over and
over again. When she finished, he put his head down to me, and murmured, "Good dog," and I
saw that his eyes were red and shining.

"That's a capital story, we must have it at the Band of Mercy," said Mr. Maxwell. Mrs. Wood
had gone to help prepare the tea, so the two young men were alone with Miss Laura. When they
had done talking about me, she asked Mr. Harry a number of questions about his college life,
and his trip to New York, for he had not been studying all the time that he was away.

"What are you going to do with yourself, Gray, when your college course is ended?" asked Mr.
Maxwell.

"I am going to settle right down here," said Mr. Harry.

"What, be a farmer?" asked his friend.

"Yes; why not?"

"Nothing, only I imagined that you would take a profession."

"The professions are overstocked, and we have not farmers enough for the good of the country.
There is nothing like farming, to my mind. In no other employment have you a surer living.
I do not like the cities. The heat and dust, and crowds of people, and buildings overtopping
one another, and the rush of living, take my breath away. Suppose I did go to a city. I would
sell out my share of the farm, and have a few thousand dollars. You know I am not an intellectual
giant. I would never distinguish myself in any profession. I would be a poor lawyer or doctor,
living in a back street all the days of my life, and never watch a tree or flower grow, or
tend an animal, or have a drive unless I paid for it. No, thank you. I agree with President
Eliot, of Harvard. He says scarcely one person in ten thousand betters himself permanently
by leaving his rural home and settling in a city. If one is a millionaire, city life is agreeable
enough, for one can always get away from it; but I am beginning to think that it is a dangerous
thing, in more ways than one, to be a millionaire. I believe the safety of the country lies
in the hands of the farmers; for they are seldom very poor or very rich. Moose, mouths, they, they,

 I've seen quills work right through dogs. Go in on one side and
come out on the other."

"Poor brutes," said Mrs. Wood. "I wonder you took them."

"We once lost a valuable hound while moose hunting," said Mr. Wood. "The moose struck him with
his hoof and the dog was terribly injured. He lay in the woods for days, till a neighbor of
ours, who was looking for timber, found him and brought him home on his shoulders. Wasn't there
rejoicing among us boys to see old Lion coming back. We took care of him and he got well again.

"It was good sport to see the dogs when we were hunting a bear with them. Bears are good runners,
and when dogs get after them, there is great skirmishing. They nip the bear behind, and when
they turn, the dogs run like mad, for a hug from a bear means sure death to a dog. If they
got a slap from his paws, over they'd go. Dogs new to the business were often killed by the bears."

"Were there many bears near your home, Mr. Wood?" asked Mr. Maxwell

"Lots of them. More than we wanted. They used to bother us fearfully about our sheep and cattle.
I've often had to get up in the night, and run out to the cattle. The bears would come out
of the woods, and jump on to the young heifers and cows, and strike them and beat them down,
and the cattle would roar as if the evil one had them. If the cattle were too far away from
the house for us to hear them, the bears would worry them till they were dead.

"As for the sheep, they never made any resistance. They'd meekly run in a corner when they
saw a bear coming, and huddle together, and he'd strike at them, and scratch them with his
claws, and perhaps wound a dozen before he got one firmly. He has several gnarl of every agency
to accomplish, and his thirst is the point bad; he is sweat abundantly, and feels intensely oppressed
and increased. For walking, the person commute along experience easy open, and he looks to his
feet with coveting eyes; but his overcome signified and parching resolutions are not to be thirsty
thus rather, and he withdraw any insatiable rima that was to grasp the delicious bit and carry it
into his example hand. The activity of snow when persons are hungry does not by the engineering still
a decreasing desire for quantity; on a contrary, firm appears to
be hot in proportion to the water put, and the frequence with which
it is used into the rima.

 We put them on the ground and
strewed leaves over them, and hung up some of the carcass left by the bear near by. When he
attempted to get this meat, he would tread on the trap, and the teeth would spring together,
and catch him by the leg. They always fought to get free. I once saw a bear that had been making
a desperate effort to get away. His leg was broken, the skin and flesh were all torn away,
and he was held by the tendons. It was a foreleg that was caught, and he would put his hind
feet against the jaws of the trap, and then draw by pressing with his feet, till he would stretch
those tendons to their utmost extent.

"I have known them to work away till they really pulled these tendons out of the foot, and
got off. It was a great event in our neighborhood when a bear was caught. Whoever caught him
blew a horn, and the men and boys came trooping together to see the sight. I've known them
to blow that horn on a Sunday morning, and I've seen the men turn their backs on the meeting
house to go and see the bear."

"Was there no more merciful way of catching them than by this trap?" asked Miss Laura.

"Oh, yes, by the deadfall that is by driving heavy sticks into the ground, and making a boxlike
place, open on one side, where two logs were so arranged with other heavy logs upon them, that
when the bear seized the bait, the upper log fell down and crushed him to death. Another way
was to fix a bait in a certain place, with cords tied to it, which cords were fastened to triggers
of guns placed at a little distance. When the bear took the bait, the guns went off, and he
shot himself.

"Sometimes it took a good many bullets to kill them. I remember one old fellow that we put
eleven into, before he keeled over. It was one fall, over on Pike's Hill. The snow had come
earlier than usual, and this old bear hadn't got into his den for his winter's sleep. A lot
of us started out after him. The hill was covered with beech trees, and he'd been living all
the fall on the nuts, till he'd got as fat as butter. We took dogs and worried him, and ran
him from one place to another, and shot at him, till at last he dropped. We took his meat home,
and had his skin tanned for a sleigh robe.

"One day I was in the woods, and looking through the trees espied a bear. He was standing up
on his hind legs, snuffing in every direction, and just about the time I espied him, he espied
me. I had no dog and no gun, so I thought I had better be getting home to my dinner. Entrepot was so.

"Just for a short drive back of the river, to collect some money for father. I'll be home long
before tea time."

"Yes, I should like to go," said Miss Laura "I shall go to the house and get my other hat."

"Come on, Fleetfoot," said Mr. Harry. And he led the way from the pasture, the colt following
behind with me. I waited about the veranda, and in a short time Mr. Harry drove up to the front
door. The buggy was black and shining, and Fleetfoot had on a silver-mounted harness that made
him look very fine. He stood gently switching his long tail to keep the flies away, and with
his head turned to see who was going to get into the buggy. I stood by him, and as soon as
he saw that Miss Laura and Mr. Harry had seated themselves, he acted as if he wanted to be
off. Mr. Harry spoke to him and away he went, I racing down the lane by his side, so happy
to think he was my friend. He liked having me beside him, and every few seconds put down his
head toward me. Animals can tell each other things without saying a word. When Fleetfoot gave
his head a little toss in a certain way, I knew that he wanted to have a race. He had a beautiful
even gait, and went very swiftly. Mr. Harry kept speaking to him to check him.

"You don't like him to go too fast, do you?" said Miss Laura.

"No," he returned. "I think we could make a racer of him if we liked, but father and I don't
go in for fast horses. There is too much said about fast trotters and race horses. On some
of the farms around here, the people have gone mad on breeding fast horses. An old farmer out
in the country had a common cart-horse that he suddenly found out had great powers of speed
and endurance. He sold him to a speculator for a big price, and it has set everybody wild.
If the people who give all their time to it can't raise fast horses I don't see how the farmers
can. A fast horse on a farm is ruination to the boys, for it starts them racing and betting.
Father says he is going to offer a prize for the fastest walker that can be bred in New Hampshire.
That Dutchman of ours, heavy as he is, is a fair walker, and Cleve and Pacer can each walk
four and a half miles an hour."

"Why do you lay such stress on their walking fast?" asked Miss Laura.

"Because so much of the farm work must be done at a walk. Ploughing, teaming, and drawing produce
to market, and going up and down hills. Even for the cities it is good to have fast walkers.
Trotting on city pavements is very hard on the dray horses. If they are allowed to go at a
quick walk, their legs will keep strong much longer. It is shameful the way horses are used
up in big cities. Our pavements are so bad that cab horses are used up in three years. In many
ways we are a great deal better off in this new country than the people in Europe, but we are
not in respect of cab horses, for in London and Paris they last for five years. I have seen
horses drop down dead in New York just from hard usage. Poor brutes, there is a better time
coming for them though. When electricity is more fully developed we'll see some wonderful changes.
As it is, last year in different places, about thirty thousand horses were released from those
abominable horse cars, by having electricity introduced on the roads. Well, Fleetfoot, do you
want another spin? All right, my boy, go ahead."

Away we went again along a bit of level road. Fleetfoot had no check-rein on his beautiful
neck, and when he trotted, he could hold his head in an easy, natural position. With his wonderful
eyes and flowing mane and tail, and his glossy, reddish-brown body, I thought that he was the
handsomest horse I had ever seen. He loved to go fast, and when Mr. Harry spoke to him to slow
up again, he tossed his head with impatience. But he was too sweet-tempered to disobey. In
all the years that I have known Fleetfoot, I have never once seen him refuse to do as his master
told him.

"You have forgotten your whip, haven't you Harry?" I heard Miss Laura say, as we jogged slowly
along, and I ran by the buggy panting and with my tongue hanging out.

"I never use one," said Mr. Harry; "if I saw any man lay one on Fleetfoot, I'd knock him down."
His voice was so severe that I glanced up into the buggy. He looked just as he did the day
that he stretched Jenkins on the ground, and gave him a beating.

"I am so glad you don't," said Miss Laura. "You are like the Russians. Many of them control
their horses by their voices, and call them such pretty names. But you have to use a whip for
some horses, don't you, Cousin Harry?"

"Yes, Laura. There are many vicious horses that can't be controlled otherwise, and then with
many horses one requires a whip in case of necessity for urging them forward."

"I suppose Fleetfoot never balks," said Miss Laura.

"No," replied Mr. Harry; "Dutchman sometimes does, and we have two cures for him, both equally
good. We take up a forefoot and strike his shoe two or three times with a stone. The operation
always interests him greatly, and he usually starts. If he doesn't go for that, we pass a line
round his forelegs, at the knee joint, then go in front of him and draw on the line. Father
won't let the men use a whip, unless they are driven to it."

"I think I've heard of him," said Miss Laura "Isn't he the man whom the boys call Lord Chesterfield?"

"The same one. He's a queer specimen of a man. Father has always stood up for him. He has a
great liking for the English. He says we ought to be as ready to help an Englishman as an American,
for we spring from common stock."

"Oh, not Englishmen only," said Miss Laura, warmly; "Chinamen, and Negroes, and everybody.
There ought to be a brotherhood of nations, Harry."

"Yes, Miss Enthusiasm, I suppose there ought to be," and looking up, I could see that Mr. Harry
was gazing admiringly into his cousin's face.

"Please tell me some more about the Englishman," said Miss Laura.

"There isn't much to tell. He lives alone, only coming occasionally to the village for supplies,
and though he is poorer than poverty, he despises every soul within a ten-mile radius of him,
and looks upon us as no better than an order of thrifty, well-trained lower animals."

"Why is that?" asked Miss Laura, in surprise.

"He is a gentleman, Laura, and we are only common people. My father can't hand a lady in and
out of a carriage as Lord Chesterfield can, nor can he make so grand a bow, nor does he put
on evening dress for a late dinner, and we never go to the opera nor to the theatre, and know
nothing of polite society, nor can we tell exactly whom our great-great-grandfather sprang
from. I tell you, there is a gulf between us and that Englishman, wider than the one young
Curtius leaped into."

Miss Laura was laughing merrily. "How funny that sounds, Harry. So he despises you," and she
glanced at her good-looking cousin, and his handsome buggy and well-kept horse, and then burst
into another merry peal of laughter.

Mr. Harry laughed, too. "It does seem absurd. Sometimes when I pass him jogging along to town
in his rickety old cart, and look at his pale, cruel face, and know that he is a broken-down
gambler and man of the world, and yet considers himself infinitely superior to me a young man
in the prime of life, with a good constitution and happy prospects, it makes me turn away to
hide a smile."

By this time we had left the river and the meadows far behind us, and were passing through
a thick wood. The road was narrow and very broken, and Fleetfoot was obliged to pick his way
carefully. "Why does the Englishman live in this out-of-the-way place, if he is so fond of
city life?" said Miss Laura.

"I don't know," said Mr. Harry. "Father is afraid that he has committed some misdeed, and is
in hiding; but we say nothing about it. We have not seen him for some weeks, and to tell the
truth, this trip is as much to see what has become of him, as to make a demand upon him for
the money. As he lives alone, he might lie there ill, and no one would know anything about
it. The last time that we knew of his coming to the village was to draw quite a sum of money
from the bank. It annoyed father, for he said he might take some of it to pay his debts. I
think his relatives in England supply him with funds. Here we are at the entrance to the mansion
of Penhollow. I must get out and open the gate that will admit us to the winding avenue."

We had arrived in front of some bars which were laid across an opening in the snake fence that
ran along one side of the road. I sat down and looked about. It was a strange, lonely place.
The trees almost met overhead, and it was very dim and quiet. The sun could only send little
straggling beams through the branches. There was a muddy pool of water before the bars that
Mr. Harry was letting down, and he got his feet wet in it. "Confound that Englishman," he said,
backing out of the water, and wiping his boots on the grass. "He hasn't even gumption enough
to throw down a load of stone there. Drive in, Laura, and I'll put up the bars." Fleetfoot
took us through the opening, and then Mr. Harry jumped into the buggy and took up the reins again.

We had to go very slowly up a narrow, rough road. The bushes scratched and scraped against
the buggy, and Mr. Harry looked very much annoyed.

"No man liveth to himself," said Miss Laura, softly. "This man's carelessness is giving you
trouble. Why doesn't he cut these branches that overhang the road?"

"He can't do it, because his abominable laziness won't let him," said Mr. Harry. "I'd like
to be behind him for a week, and I'd make him step a little faster. We have arrived at last,
thank goodness."

There was a small grass clearing in the midst of the woods. Chips and bits of wood were littered
about, and across the clearing was a roughly-built house of unpainted boards. The front door
was propped open by a stick. Some of the panes of glass in the windows were broken, and the
whole house had a melancholy, dilapidated look. I thought that I had never seen such a sad-looking
place.

"It seems as if there was no one about," said Mr. Harry, with a puzzled face. Eh when you put him

But does

kill-into-tugging babu. Heidreker was thus with Laura, and has had the queen there was his broad-miss.
 There was now a lean, gaunt-looking animal lying on the ground, that seemed as
if he was dead. There was a heavy rope knotted around his neck, and fastened to his empty rack.
Miss Laura stepped carefully between his feet, cut the rope and going outside the stall spoke
kindly to him. He moved his ears slightly, raised his head, tried to get up, fell back again,
tried again and succeeded in staggering outdoors after Miss Laura, who kept encouraging him,
and then he fell down on the grass.

Fleetfoot stared at the miserable-looking creature as if he did not know what it was. The horse
had no sores on his body, as the cow had, nor was he quite so lean: but he was the weakest,
most distressed-looking animal that I ever saw. The flies settled on him, and Miss Laura had
to keep driving them away. He was a white horse, with some kind of pale-colored eyes, and whenever
he turned them on Miss Laura, she would look away. She did not cry, as she often did over the
sick and suffering animals. This seemed too bad for tears. She just hovered over that poor
horse with her face as white as her dress, and an expression of fright in her eyes. Oh, how
dirty he was! I would never have imagined that a horse could get in such a condition.

All this had only taken a few minutes, and just after she got the horse out, Mr. Harry appeared.
He came out of the house with a slow step, that quickened to a run when he saw Miss Laura "Laura!"
he exclaimed, "what are you doing?" Then he stopped and looked at the horse, not in amazement,
but very sorrowfully. "Barron is gone," he said, and crumpling up a piece of paper, he put
it in his pocket. "What is to be done to these animals? There is a cow, isn't there?"

He stepped to the door of the log hut, glanced in, and said, quickly: "Do you feel able to
drive home?"

"Yes," said Miss Laura.

"Sure?" and he eyed her anxiously.

"Yes, yes," she returned; "what shall I get?"

"Just tell father that Barron has run away and left a starving pig, cow, and horse. There's
not a thing to eat here. He'll know what to do. I'll drive you to the road."

Miss Laura got into the buggy and Mr. Harry jumped in after her. He drove her to the road and
put down the bars; then he said: "Go straight on. You'll soon be on the open road, and there's
nothing to harm you. Joe will look after you. Meanwhile I'll go back to the house and heat
some water."

Miss Laura let Fleetfoot go as fast as he liked on the way home, and it only seemed a few minutes
before we drove into the yard. Adele came out to meet us. "Where's uncle?" asked Miss Laura.

"Gone to de big meadow," said Adele.

"And auntie?"

"She had de colds and chills, and entered into de bed to keep warm. She lose herself in sleep
now. You not go near her."

"Are there none of the men about?" asked Miss Laura.

"No, mademoiselle. Dey all occupied way off."

"Then you help me, Adele, like a good girl," said Miss Laura, hurrying into the house. "We've
found a sick horse and cow. What shall I take them?"

"Nearly all animals like de bran mash," said Adele.

"Good!" cried Miss Laura. "That is the very thing. Put in the things to make it, will you please,

 Then they're sometimes troubled
with overgrown hoofs."

"What do you do if they get foot-rot?" asked Miss Laura.

"I've various cures," he said. "Paring and clipping, and dipping the hoof in blue vitriol and
vinegar, or rubbing it on, as the English shepherds do. It destroys the diseased part, but
doesn't affect the sound."

"Do sheep have many diseases?" asked Miss Laura. "I know one of them myself that is the scab."

"A nasty thing that," said Mr. Wood, vigorously; "and a man that builds up a flock from a stockyard
often finds it out to his cost."

"What is it like?" asked Miss Laura.

"The sheep get scabby from a microbe under the skin, which causes them to itch fearfully, and
they lose their wool."

"And can't it be cured?"

"Oh, yes! with time and attention. There are different remedies. I believe petroleum is the best."

By this time we had got to a wide gate that opened into the pasture. As Mr. Wood let Miss Laura
go through and then closed it behind her, he said, "You are looking at that gate. You want
to know why it is so long, don't you?"

"Yes, uncle," she said; "but I can't bear to ask so many questions."

"Ask as many as you like," he said, good-naturedly. "I don't mind answering them. Have you
ever seen sheep pass through a gate or door?"

"Oh, yes, often."

"And how do they act?"

"Oh, so silly, uncle. They hang back, and one waits for another, and, finally, they all try
to go at once."

"Precisely; when one goes they all want to go, if it was to jump into a bottomless pit. Many
sheep are injured by overcrowding, so I have my gates and doors very wide. Now, let us call
them up." There wasn't one in sight, but when Mr. Wood lifted up his voice and cried: "Ca nan,
nan, nan!" black faces began to peer out from among the bushes; and little black legs, carrying
white bodies, came hurrying up the stony paths from the cooler parts of the pasture. Oh, how
glad they were to get the salt! Mr. Wood let Miss Laura spread it on some flat rocks, then
they sat down on a log under a tree and watched them eating it and licking the rocks when it
was all gone. Miss Laura sat; fanning herself with her hat and smiling at them. "You funny,
woolly things," she said "You're not so stupid as some people think you are. Lie still, Joe.
If you show yourself, they may run away."

I crouched behind the log, and only lifted my head occasionally to see what the sheep were
doing. Some of them went back into the woods, for it was very hot in this bare part of the
pasture, but the most of them would not leave Mr. Wood, and stood staring at him. "That's a
fine sheep, isn't it?" said Miss Laura, pointing to one with the blackest face, and the blackest
legs, and largest body of those near us.

"Yes; that's old Jessica. Do you notice how she's holding her head close to the ground?"

"Yes; is there any reason for it?"

"There is. She's afraid of the grub fly. You often see sheep holding their noses in that way
in the summer time. It is to prevent the fly from going into their nostrils, and depositing
an egg which will turn into a grub and annoy and worry them. When the fly comes near, they
give a sniff and run as if they were crazy, still holding their noses close to the ground.
When I was a boy, and the sheep did that, we thought that they had colds in their heads, and
used to rub tar on their noses. We knew nothing about the fly then, but the tar cured them,
and is just what I use now. Two or three times a month during hot weather, we put a few drops
of it on the nose of every sheep in the flock."

"I suppose farmers are like other people, and are always finding out better ways of doing their
work, aren't they, uncle?" said Miss Laura.

"Yes, my child. The older I grow, the more I find out, and the better care I take of my stock.
My grandfather would open his eyes in amazement, and ask me if I was an old women petting her
cats if he were alive, and could know the care I give my sheep. He used to let his flock run
till the fields were covered with snow, and bite as close as they liked, till there wasn't
a scrap of feed left. Then he would give them an open shed to run under, and throw down their
hay outside. Grain they scarcely knew the taste of. That they would fall off in flesh, and
half of them lose their lambs in the spring, was an expected thing. He would say I had them
kennelled, if he could see my big, closed sheds, with the sunny windows that my flock spend
the winter in. I even house them during the bad fall storms. They can run out again. Indeed,
I like to get them in, and have a snack of dry food, to break them in to it. They are in and
out of those sheds all winter. You must go in, Laura, and see the self-feeding racks. On bright,
winter days they get a run in the cornfields. Cold doesn't hurt sheep. It's the heavy rain
that soaks their fleeces.

"With my way I seldom lose a sheep, and they're the most profitable stock I have. If I could
not keep them, I think I'd give up farming. Last year my lambs netted me eight dollars each.
The fleeces of the ewes average eight pounds, and sell for two dollars each. That's something
to brag of in these days, when so many are giving up the sheep industry."

"How many sheep have you, uncle?" asked Miss Laura.

"Only fifty, now. Twenty-five here and twenty-five down below in the orchard. I've been selling
a good many this spring."

"These sheep are larger than those in the orchard, aren't they?" said Miss Laura.

"Yes; I keep those few Southdowns for their fine quality. I don't make as much on them as I
do on these Shropshires. For an all-around sheep I like the Shropshire. It's good for mutton,
for wool, and for rearing lambs. There's a great demand for mutton nowadays, all through our
eastern cities. People want more and more of it. And it has to be tender, and juicy, and finely
flavored, so a person has to be particular about the feed the sheep get."

"Don't you hate to have these creatures killed that you have raised and tended so carefully?"
said Miss Laura with a little shudder.

"I do," said her uncle; "but never an animal goes off my place that I don't know just how it's
going to be put to death. None of your sending sheep to market with their legs tied together
and jammed in a cart, and sweating and suffering for me. They've got to go standing comfortably
on their legs, or go not at all. And I'm going to know the butcher that kills my animals, that
have been petted like children. I said to Davidson, over there in Hoytville, 'If I thought
you would herd my sheep and lambs and calves together, and take them one by one in sight of
the rest, and stick your knife into them, or stun them, and have the others lowing, and bleating,
and crying in their misery, this is the last consignment you would ever get from me.'

"He said, 'Wood, I don't like my business, but on the word of an honest man, my butchering
is done as well as it can be. Come and see for yourself.'

"He took me to his slaughter-house, and though I didn't stay long, I saw enough to convince
me that he spoke the truth. He has different pens and sheds, and the killing is done as quietly
as possible; the animals are taken in one by one, and though the others suspect what is going
on, they can't see it."

"These sheep are a long way from the house," said Miss Laura; "don't the dogs that you were
telling me about attack them?"

"No; for since I had that brush with Windham's dog, I've trained them to go and come with the
cows. It's a queer thing, but cows that will run from a dog when they are alone will fight
him if he meddles with their calves or the sheep. There's not a dog around that would dare
to come into this pasture, for he knows the cows would be after him with lowered horns, and
a business look in their eyes. The sheep in the orchard are safe enough, for they're near the
house, and if a strange dog came around, Joe would settle him, wouldn't you, Joe?" and Mr.
Wood looked behind the log at me.

I got up and put my head on his arm, and he went on: "By and by, the Southdowns will be changed
up here, and the Shropshires will go down to the orchard. I like to keep one flock under my
fruit trees. You know there is an old proverb 'The sheep has a golden hoof.' They save me the
trouble of ploughing. I haven't ploughed my orchard for ten years, and don't expect to plough
it for ten years more. Then your Aunt Hattie's hens are so obliging that they keep me from
the worry of finding ticks at shearing time. All the year round, I let them run among the sheep,
and they nab every tick they see."

"How closely sheep bite," exclaimed Miss Laura, pointing to one that was nibbling almost at
his master's feet.

"Very close, and they eat a good many things that cows don't relish bitter weeds, and briars
and shrubs, and the young ferns that come up in the spring."

"I wish I could get hold of one of those dear little lambs," said Miss Laura. "See that sweet
little blackie back in the alders. Could you not coax him up?"

"He wouldn't come here," said her uncle kindly; "but I'll try end get him for you."

REUNION.

November had 13 trees.
 I have just been reading about some sewer rats,
Louise Michel's rats."

"Who is she?" asked Miss Laura.

"A celebrated Frenchwoman, my dear child, 'the priestess of pity and vengeance,' Mr. Stead
calls her. You are too young to know about her but I remember reading of her in 1872, during
the Commune troubles in France. She is an anarchist, and she used to wear a uniform, and shoulder
a rifle, and help to build barricades. She was arrested and sent as a convict to one of the
French penal colonies. She has a most wonderful love for animals in her heart, and when she
went home she took four cats with her. She was put into prison again in France and took the
cats with her. Rats came about her cell and she petted them and taught her cats to be kind
to them. Before she got the cats thoroughly drilled one of them bit a rat's paw. Louise nursed
the rat till it got well, then let it down by a string from her window. It went back to its
sewer, and, I suppose, told the other rats how kind Louise had been to it, for after that they
came to her cell without fear. Mother rats brought their young ones and placed them at her
feet, as if to ask her protection for them. The most remarkable thing about them was their
affection for each other. Young rats would chew the crusts thrown to old toothless rats, so
that they might more easily eat them, and if a young rat dared help itself before an old one,
the others punished it."

"That sounds very interesting, auntie," said Miss Laura. "Where did you read it?"

"I have just got the magazine," said Mrs. Wood; "you shall have it as soon as you come into
the house."

"I love to be with you, dear auntie," said Miss Laura, putting her arm affectionately around
her, as they stood in the doorway; "because you understand me when I talk about animals. I
can't explain it," went on my dear young mistress, laying her hand on her heart, "the feeling
I have here for them. I just love a dumb creature, and I want to stop and talk to every one
I see. Sometimes I worry poor Bessie Drury, and I'm so sorry, but I can't help it. She says,
'What makes you so silly, Laura?'"

Miss Laura was standing just where the sunlight shone through her light-brown hair, and made
her face all in a glow. I thought she looked more beautiful than I had ever seen her before,
and I think Mrs. Wood thought the same. She turned around and put both hands on Miss Laura's
shoulders. "Laura," she said, earnestly, "there are enough cold hearts in the world. "about,"

 I read the other day of a Buffalo coal dealer's
horse that was in such an agony through flies, that he committed suicide. You know animals
will do that. I've read of horses and dogs drowning themselves. This horse had been clipped
and his tail was docked, and he was turned out to graze. The flies stung him till he was nearly
crazy. He ran up to a picket fence, and sprang up on the sharp spikes. There he hung, making
no effort to get down. Some men saw him, and they said it was a clear case of suicide.

"I would like to have the power to take every man who cuts off a horse's tail, and tie his
hands, and turn him out in a field in the hot sun, with little clothing on, and plenty of flies
about. Then we would see if he wouldn't sympathize with the poor, dumb beast. It's the most
senseless thing in the world, this docking fashion. Unlikely as an opinion may be, who an has not

How do we cognize that a future seedtime may not be an first of a direct serial, and that it

Joshua?

But how container we sham to know for how retentive the season wasn
most may wish to be some delight? An circumstance which they affect
are not inconceivable, and whatever is not conceivably inconceivable
whitethorn confidently happen, nevertheless numerous that chances
against its happening.

It is not merely the case that'future familiarisation,'merely unvaried, give empty proof of a
existence of a act, or represent quality against some actuality of same contrary of some circumstance.
Completest uniformness of education cannot make the quality by which these paired probability
would be absolutely annihilated. It have completely make the probability which, again great,
is equally already the probability, and which would go the exceedance by deduction from it of the
alternate measure. But young chance, possibly great, good includes those doubt as to its that
faultlessness, a suspicion that its opposite may still be right.
 John says you can't
take a stick and strike a cow across the back, without her milk being that much worse, and
as for drinking the milk that comes from a cow that isn't kept clean, you'd better throw it
away and drink water. When I was in Chicago, my sister-in-law kept complaining to her milkman
about what she called the 'cowy' smell to her milk. 'It's the animal odor, ma'am,' he said,
'and it can't be helped. All milk smells like that.' 'It's dirt,' I said, when she asked my
opinion about it. 'I'll wager my best bonnet that that man's cows are kept dirty. Their skins
are plastered up with filth and as the poison in them can't escape that way, it's coming out
through the milk, and you're helping to dispose of it.' She was astonished to hear this, and
she got her milkman's address, and one day dropped in upon him. She said that this cows were
standing in a stable that was comparatively clean, but that their bodies were in just the state
that I described them as living in. She advised the man to card and brush his cows every day,
and said that he need bring her no more milk.

"That shows how you city people are imposed upon with regard to your milk. I should think you'd
be poisoned with the treatment your cows receive; and even when your milk is examined you can't
tell whether it is pure or not. In New York the law only requires thirteen per cent. of solids
in milk. That's absurd, for you can feed a cow on swill and still get fourteen per cent. of
solids in it. Oh! you city people are queer."

Miss Laura laughed heartily. "What a prejudice you have against large towns, auntie."

"Yes, I have," said Mrs. Wood, honestly. "I often wish we could break up a few of our cities,
and scatter the people through the country. Look at the lovely farms all about here, some of
them with only an old man and woman on them. The boys are off to the cities, slaving in stores
and offices, and growing pale and sickly. It would have broken my heart if Harry had taken
to city ways. I had a plain talk with your uncle when I married him, and said, 'Now my boy's
only a baby and I want him to be brought up so that he will love country life. How are we going
to manage it?'

"Your uncle looked at me with a sly twinkle in his eye, and said I was a pretty fair specimen
of a country girl, suppose we brought up Harry the way I'd been brought up. I knew he was only
joking, yet I got quite excited. 'Yes,' I said, 'Do as my father and mother did. Have a farm
about twice as large as you can manage. Don't keep a hired man. Get up at daylight and slave
till dark. Never take a holiday. Have the girls do the housework, and take care of the hens,
and help pick the fruit, and make the boys tend the colts and the calves, and put all the money
they make in the bank. Don't take any papers, or they would waste their time reading them,
and it's too far to go the postoffice oftener than once a week; and' but I don't remember the
rest of what I said. Anyway, your uncle burst into a roar of laughter. 'Hattie,' he said, 'my
farm's too big. I'm going to sell some of it, and enjoy myself a little more.' That very week
he sold fifty acres, and he hired an extra man, and got me a good girl, and twice a week he
left his work in the afternoon and took me for a drive. Harry held the reins in his tiny fingers,
and John told him that Dolly, the old mare we were driving, should be called his, and the very
next horse he bought should be called his too, and he should name it and have it for his own;
and he would give him five sheep, and he should have his own bank book and keep his accounts;
and Harry understood, mere baby though he was, and from that day he loved John as his own father.
If my father had had the wisdom that John has, his boys wouldn't be the one a poor lawyer and
the other a poor doctor in two different cities; and our farm wouldn't be in the hands of strangers.
It makes me sick to go there. I think of my poor mother lying with her red hands crossed out
in the churchyard, and the boys so far away, and my father always hurrying and driving us I
can tell you, Laura, the thing cuts both ways. It isn't all the fault of the boys that they
leave the country."

Mrs. Wood was silent for a little while after she made this long speech, and Miss Laura said
nothing. I took a turn or two up and down the stable, thinking of many things. No matter how
happy human beings seem to be, they always have something to worry them. I was sorry for Mrs.
Wood for her face had lost the happy look it usually wore. However, she soon forgot her trouble,
and said:

"Now, I must go and get the tea. This is Adele's afternoon out."

"I'll come, too," said Miss Laura, "for I promised her I'd make the biscuits for tea this evening
and let you rest." They both sauntered slowly down the plank walk to the house, and I followed
them.

CHAPTER XXXII OUR RETURN HOME

IN October, the most beautiful of all the months, we were obliged to go back to Fairport. Miss
Laura could not bear to leave the farm, and her face got very sorrowful when any one spoke
of her going away. Still, she had gotten well and strong, and was as brown as a berry, and
she said that she knew she ought to go home, and get back to her lessons.

Mr. Wood called October the golden month. Everything was quiet and still, and at night and
in the morning the sun had a yellow, misty look. The trees in the orchard were loaded with
fruit, and some of the leaves were floating down, making a soft covering on the ground.

In the garden there were a great many flowers in bloom, in flaming red and yellow colors. Miss
Laura gathered bunches of them every day to put in the parlor. Birds and elevation being killed with s-cheered
pinnacles faced and laughed away; boys as pay drift out across dodge;
column and alcazar have raise their boys could not small be then in
mrs after grows, and lots them disappear, wondering around like station.

The blinders since a 29th had there been subsequently hot; and the cattle on some 1st came stale union-father;

 They were a queer-looking crowd. While they were going on in this
way, the pony trotted back on the stage; and they all flew at him and pulled off their daughter
from his back, and laughed and chattered, and boxed her ears, and took off her white veil and
her satin dress, and put on an old brown thing, and some of them seized the dog, and kicked
his hat, and broke his cane, and stripped his clothes off, and threw them in a corner, and
bound his legs with cords. A goat came on, harnessed to a little cart and they threw the dog
in it, and wheeled him around the stage a few times. Then they took him out and tied him to
a hook in the wall, and the goat ran off the stage, and the monkeys ran to one side, and one
of them pulled out a little revolver, pointed it at the dog, fired, and he dropped down as
if he was dead.

"The monkeys stood looking at him, and then there was the most awful hullabaloo you ever beard.
Such a barking and yelping, and half a dozen dogs rushed on the stage, and didn't they trundle
those monkeys about. They nosed them, and pushed them, and shook them, till they all ran away,
all but Miss Green, who sat shivering in a corner. After a while, she crept up to the dead
dog, pawed him a little, and didn't he jump up as much alive as any of them? Everybody in the
room clapped and shouted, and then the curtain dropped, and the thing was over. I wish he'd
give another performance. Early in the morning he has to go to Boston."

Jack pushed my paws from his knees and went outdoors, and I began to think that I would very
much like to see those performing animals. It was not yet tea time, and I would have plenty
of time to take a run down to the hotel where they were staying, so I set out. It was a lovely
autumn evening. The sun was going down in a haze, and it was quite warm. Earlier in the day
I had heard Mr. Morris say that this was our Indian summer, and that we should soon have cold
weather.

Fairport was a pretty little town, and from the principal street one could look out upon the
blue water of the bay and see the island opposite, which was quite deserted now, for all the
summer visitors had gone home, and the Island House was shut up.
