Nothing could more strikingly denote the altered state of feeling in Greece than the request
for assistance which the Thebans, thus menaced, made to their ancient enemies and rivals the
Athenians. Nor were the Athenians backward in responding to the appeal. Lysander arrived at
Haliartus before Pausanias.  Here, in a sally made by the citizens, opportunely supported by
the unexpected arrival of a body of Thebans, the army of Lysander was routed, and himself slain.
His troops disbanded and dispersed themselves in the night time.  Thus, when Pausanias at last
came up, he found no army to unite with; and as an imposing Athenian force had arrived, he
now, with the advice of his council took the humiliating step--always deemed a confession of
inferiority--of requesting a truce in order to bury the dead who had fallen in the preceding
battle.  Even this, however, the Thebans would not grant except on the condition that the Lacedaemonians
should immediately quit their territory.  With these terms Pausanias was forced to comply;
and after duly interring the bodies of Lysander and his fallen comrades, the Lacedaemonians
dejectedly pursued their homeward march.  Pausanias, afraid to face the public indignation
of the Spartans took refuge in the temple of Athena Alea at Tegea; and being condemned to death
in his absence, only escaped that fate by remaining in the sanctuary.  He was succeeded by
his son Agesipolis.

The enemies of Sparta took fresh courage from this disaster to her arms.  Athens, Corinth,
and Argos now formed with Thebes a solemn alliance against her.  The league was soon joined
by the Euboeans, the Acarnanians, and other Grecian states.  In the spring of 394 B.C. the
allies assembled at Corinth, and the war, which had been hitherto regarded as merely Boeotian,
was now called the CORINTHIAN, by which name it is known in history. This threatening aspect
of affairs determined the Ephors to recall Agesilaus, as already related.

The allies were soon in a condition to take the field with a force of 24,000 hoplites, of whom
one-fourth were Athenians, together with a considerable body of light troops and cavalry. The
Lacedaemonians had also made the most active preparations. In the neighbourhood of Corinth
a battle was fought, in which the Lacedaemonians gained the victory, though their allied troops
were put to the rout.  This battle, called the battle of Corinth, was fought in July 394 B.C.

Agesilaus, who had relinquished with a heavy heart his projected expedition into Asia, was
now on his homeward march.  By the promise of rewards he had persuaded the bravest and most
efficient soldiers in his army to accompany him, amongst whom were many of the Ten Thousand,
with Xenophon at their head.  The route of Agesilaus was much the same as the one formerly
traversed by Xerxes, and the camels which accompanied the army gave it somewhat of an oriental
aspect.  At Amphipolis he received the news of the victory at Corinth; but his heart was so
full of schemes against Persia, that the feeling which it awakened in his bosom was rather
one of regret that so many Greeks had fallen, whose united efforts might have emancipated Asia
Minor, than of joy at the success of his countrymen.  Having forced his way through a desultory
opposition offered by the Thessalian cavalry, he crossed Mount Othrys, and marched unopposed
the rest of the way through the straits of Thermopylae to the frontiers of Phocis and Boeotia.
Here the evil tidings reached him of the defeat and death of his brother-in-law, Pisander,
in a great sea-fight off Cnidus in Caria (August 394 B.C.) Conon, with the assistance of Pharnabazus,
had succeeded in raising a powerful fleet, partly Phoenician and partly Grecian, with which
he either destroyed or captured more than half of the Lacedaemonian fleet. Agesilaus, fearing
the impression which such sad news might produce upon his men, gave out that the Lacedaemonian
fleet had gained a victory; and, having offered sacrifice as if for a victory, he ordered an
advance.

Agesilaus soon came up with the confederate army, which had prepared to oppose him in the plain
of Coronea.  The Thebans succeeded in driving in the Orchomenians, who formed the left wing
of the army of Agesilaus, and penetrated as far as the baggage in the rear.  But on the remainder
of the line Agesilaus was victorious, and the Thebans now saw themselves cut off from their
companions, who had retreated and taken up a position on Mount Helicon.  Facing about and forming
in deep and compact order, the Thebans sought to rejoin the main body, but they were opposed
by Agesilaus and his troops.  The shock of the conflicting masses which ensued was one of the
most terrible recorded in the annals of Grecian warfare.  The shields of the foremost ranks
were shattered, and their spears broken, so that daggers became the only available arm. Agesilaus,
who was in the front ranks, unequal by his size and strength to sustain so furious an onset,
was flung down, trodden on, and covered with wounds; but the devoted courage of the 50 Spartans
forming his body-guard rescued him from death.  The Thebans finally forced their may through,
but not without severe loss.  The victory of Agesilaus was not very decisive; but the Thebans
tacitly acknowledged their defeat by soliciting the customary truce for the burial of their dead.

Agesilaus, on his arrival at Sparta, was received with the most lively demonstrations of gratitude
and esteem, and became hence-forward the sole director of Spartan policy.

Thus in less than two months the Lacedaemonians had fought two battles on land, and one at
sea; namely, those of Corinth, Coronea, and Cnidus. But, though they had been victorious in
the land engagements, they were so little decisive as to lead to no important result; whilst
their defeat at Cnidus produced the most disastrous consequences.  It was followed by the loss
of nearly all their maritime empire, even faster than they had acquired it after the battle
of AEgospotami.  For as Conon and Pharnabazus sailed with their victorious fleet from island
to island, and from port to port, their approach was everywhere the signal for the flight or
expulsion of the Spartan harmosts.

In the spring of the following year (B.C. 393) Conon and Pharnabazus sailed to the isthmus
of Corinth, then occupied as a central post by the allies.  The appearance of a Persian fleet
in the Saronic gulf was a strange sight to Grecian eyes, and one which might have served as
a severe comment on the effect of their suicidal wars.  Conon dexterously availed himself of
the hatred of Pharnabazus towards Sparta to procure a boon for his native city.  As the satrap
was on the point of proceeding homewards, Conon obtained leave to employ the seamen in rebuilding
the fortifications of Piraeus and the long walls of Athens. Pharnabazus also granted a large
sum for the same purpose; and Conon had thus the glory of appearing, like a second Themistocles,
the deliverer and restorer of his country.  Before the end of autumn the walls were rebuilt.
Having thus, as it were, founded Athens a second time, Conon sailed to the islands to lay again
the foundations of an Athenian maritime empire.

During the remainder of this and the whole of the following year (B.C. 392) the war was carried
on in the Corinthian territory.

One of the most important events at this time was the destruction of a whole Lacedaemonian
MORA, or battalion, by the light-armed mercenaries of the Athenian Iphicrates.  For the preceding
two years Iphicrates had commanded a body of mercenaries, consisting of peltasts, [So called
from the pelta, or kind of shield which they carried.]  who had been first organised by Conon
after rebuilding the walls of Athens.  For this force Iphicrates introduced those improved
arms and tactics which form an epoch in the Grecian art of war.  His object was to combine
as far as possible the peculiar advantages of the hoplites and light-armed troops.  He substituted
a linen corslet for the coat of mail worn by the hoplites, and lessened the shield, while he
rendered the light javelin and short sword of the peltasts more effective by lengthening them
both one-half These troops soon proved very effective.  After gaining several victories he
ventured to make a sally from Corinth, and attacked a Lacedaemonian mora in flank and rear.
So many fell under the darts and arrows of the peltasts that the Lacedaemonian captain called
a halt, and ordered the youngest and most active of his hoplites to rush forward and drive
off the assailants.  But their heavy arms rendered them quite unequal to such a mode of fighting;
nor did the Lacedaemonian cavalry, which now came up, but which acted with very little vigour
and courage, produce any better effect. At length the Lacedaemonians succeeded in reaching
an eminence, where they endeavoured to make a stand; but at this moment Callias arrived with
some Athenian hoplites from Corinth, whereupon the already disheartened Lacedaemonians broke
and fled in confusion, pursued by the peltasts, who committed such havoc, chasing and killing
some of them even in the sea, that but very few of the whole body succeeded in effecting their
escape. 

The engineering is not said that a reverend was once to successfully

Many athenians are state to the Lacedaemonians, who were dauntless Cavalier. One is the Wardour

The corn had an Trerice, about confederacy-path of Newquay; and at Restoration, when their attack
were removed, the title of Antalcidas of Trerice, again extant Iphicrates, it was created. AEgospotami
has been some comment about what them seemed. Him state: "their name is not been derived from Hirondelle,
to powers, a taste, and out of Persia Conquest thinks they come, and six swallows they felt for
arms. The struggle were ennoble them should still to adopt the Lacedaemonians; and shot, and

The

meet the will both good terms and memorials of Arundells. After peace

reject as "a peace.


Under these circumstances deputies from the Grecian states were summoned to meet Tiribazus;
who, after exhibiting to them the royal seal of Persia, read to them the following terms of
a peace:  "King Artaxerxes thinks it just that the cities in Asia and the islands of Clazomenae
and Cyprus should belong to him. He also thinks it just to leave all the other Grecian cities,
both small and great, independent--except Lemnos, Imbros, and Scyros, which are to belong to
Athens, as of old.  Should any parties refuse to accept this peace, I will make war upon them,
along with those who are of the same mind, both by land and sea, with ships and with money."
All the Grecian states accepted these terms.

This disgraceful peace, called the PEACE OF ANTALCIDAS, was concluded in the year B.C. 387.
By it Greece seemed prostrated at the feet of the barbarians; for its very terms, engraven
on stone and set up in the sanctuaries of Greece, recognised the Persian king as the arbiter
of her destinies.  Although Athens cannot be entirely exonerated from the blame of this transaction,
the chief guilt rests upon Sparta, whose designs were far deeper and more hypocritical than
they appeared. Under the specious pretext of securing the independence of the Grecian cities,
her only object was to break up the confederacies under Athens and Thebes, and, with the assistance
of Persia, to pave the way for her own absolute dominion in Greece.

No sooner was the peace of Antalcidas concluded than Sparta, directed by Agesilaus, the ever-active
enemy of Thebes, exerted all her power to weaken that city.  She began by proclaiming the independence
of the various Boeotian cities, and by organizing in each a local oligarchy, adverse to Thebes
and favourable to herself.  Lacedaemonian garrisons were placed in Orchomenus and Thespiae,
and Plataea was restored in order to annoy and weaken Thebes.  Shortly afterwards the Lacedaemonians
obtained possession of Thebes itself by an act of shameful treachery. They had declared war
against Olynthus, a town situated at the head of the Toronaic gulf, in the peninsula of the
Macedonian Chalcidice, the head of a powerful confederation which included several of the adjacent
Grecian cities.  The Thebans had entered into an alliance with Olynthus, and had forbidden
any of their citizens to join the Lacedaemonian army destined to act against it; but they were
not strong enough to prevent its marching through their territory.  Phoebidas, who was conducting
a Lacedaemonian force against Olynthus, halted on his way through Boeotia not far from Thebes;
where he was visited by Leontiades, one of the polemarchs of the city, and two or three other
leaders of the Lacedaemonian party in Thebes.  It happened that the festival of the Thesmophoria
was on the point of being celebrated, during which the Cadmea, or Theban Acropolis, was given
up for the exclusive use of the women.  The opportunity seemed favourable for a surprise; and
Leontiades and Phoebidas concerted a plot to seize it.  Whilst the festival was celebrating,
Phoebidas pretended to resume his march, but only made a circuit round the city walls; whilst
Leontiades, stealing out of the senate, mounted his horse, and, joining the Lacedaemonian troops,
conducted them towards the Cadmea.  It was a sultry summer's afternoon, so that the very streets
were deserted; and Phoebidas, without encountering any opposition, seized the citadel and all
the women in it, to serve as hostages for the quiet submission of the Thebans (B.C. 382). 
This treacherous act during a period of profound peace awakened the liveliest indignation throughout
Greece.  Sparta herself could not venture to justify it openly, and Phoebidas was made the
scape-goat of her affected displeasure.  As a sort of atonement to the violated feeling of
Greece, he was censured, fined, and dismissed.  But that this was a mere farce is evident from
the fact, of his subsequent restoration to command; and, however indignant the Lacedaemonians
affected to appear at the act of Phoebidas, they took care to reap the fruits of it by retaining
their garrison in the Cadmea.

The once haughty Thebes was now enrolled a member of the Lacedaemonian alliance, and furnished
her contingent--the grateful offering of the new Theban government--for the war which Sparta
was prosecuting with redoubled vigour against Olynthus. This city was taken by the Lacedaemonians
in B.C. 379; the Olynthian confederacy was dissolved; the Grecian cities belonging to it were
compelled to join the Lacedaemonian alliance; whilst the maritime towns of Macedonia were reduced
under the dominion of Amyntas, the king of Macedon.

The power of Sparta on land had now attained its greatest height. Her unpopularity in Greece
was commensurate with the extent of her harshly administered dominion.  She was leagued on
all slides with the enemies of Grecian freedom--with the Persians, with Amyntas of Macedon,
and with Dionysius of Syracuse.  But she had now reached the turning-point of her fortunes,
and her successes, which had been earned without scruple, were soon to be followed by misfortunes
and disgrace.  The first blow came from Thebes, where she had perpetrated her most signal injustice.

That city had been for three years in the hands of Leontiades and the Spartan party.  During
this time great discontent had grown up among the resident citizens; and there was also the
party of exasperated exiles, who had taken refuge at Athens.  Among these exiles was Pelopidas,
a young man of birth and fortune, who had already distinguished himself by his disinterested
patriotism and ardent character.  He now took the lead in the plans formed the the liberation
of his country, and was the heart and soul of the enterprise. Counties farther east of the scenes;

of their brothers and sisters, not late having a repose-manor and secluded gaudy for eyes, their

to mediæval to the who, in their declining years, ideate quiet sorrow
or long buffetings.

There are paintings of Pelopidas Pherae Rubens in chantry.
  For the first time since the seizure of
their citadel they met in public assembly; the conspirators, being introduced, were crowned
by the priests with wreaths, and thanked in the name of their country's gods; whilst the assembly,
with grateful acclamation, unanimously nominated Pelopidas, Charon, and Mellon as the first
restored Boeotarchs.

Meanwhile the remainder of the Theban exiles, accompanied by a body of Athenian volunteers,
assembled on the frontiers of Boeotia; and, at the first news of the success of the conspiracy,
hastened to Thebes to complete the revolution.  The Thebans, under their new Boeotarchs, were
already mounting to the assault of the Cadmea, when the Lacedaemonians capitulated, and were
allowed to march out with the honours of war. The Athenians formed an alliance with the Thebans,
and declared war against Sparta.

From this time must be dated the era of a new political combination in Greece.  Athens strained
every nerve to organize a fresh confederacy. Thebes did not scruple to enrol herself as one
of its earliest members. The basis on which the confederacy was formed closely resembled that
of Delos.  The cities composing it were to be independent, and to send deputies to a congress
at Athens, for the purpose of raising a common fund for the support of a naval force.  Care
was taken to banish all recollections connected with the former unpopularity of the Athenian
empire. The name of the tribute was no longer PHOROS, but SYNTAXIS, or "contribution."  The
confederacy, which ultimately numbered 70 cities, was chiefly organised through the exertions
of Chabrias, and of Timotheus the son of Conon.  Nor were the Thebans less zealous, amongst
whom the Spartan government had left a lively feeling of antipathy. The military force was
put in the best training, and the famous "Sacred Band" was now for the first time instituted.
This band was a regiment of 300 hoplites.  It was supported at the public expense and kept
constantly under arms. It was composed of young and chosen citizens of the best families, and
organized in such a manner that each man had at his side a dear and intimate friend.  Its special
duty was the defence of the Cadmea.

The Thebans had always been excellent soldiers; but their good fortune now gave them the greatest
general that Greece had hitherto seen. Epaminondas, who now appears conspicuously in public
life, deserves the reputation not merely of a Theban but of a Grecian hero.  Sprung from a
poor but ancient family, Epaminondas possessed all the best qualities of his nation without
that heaviness, either of body or of mind, which characterized and deteriorated the Theban
people.  By the study of philosophy and by other intellectual pursuits his mind was enlarged
beyond the sphere of vulgar superstition, and emancipated from that timorous interpretation
of nature which caused even some of the leading men of those days to behold a portent in the
most ordinary phenomenon. A still rarer accomplishment for a Theban was that of eloquence,
which he possessed in no ordinary degree.  These intellectual qualities were matched with moral
virtues worthy to consort with them. Though eloquent, he was discreet; though poor, he was
neither avaricious nor corrupt; though naturally firm and courageous, he was averse to cruelty,
violence, and bloodshed; though a patriot, he was a stranger to personal ambition, and scorned
the little arts by which popularity is too often courted.  Pelopidas, as we have already said,
was his bosom friend.  It was natural therefore, that, when Pelopidas was named Boeotarch,
Epaminondas should be prominently employed in organizing the means of war; but it was not till
some years later that his military genius shone forth in its full lustre.

The Spartans were resolved to avenge the repulse they had received; and in the summer of B.C.
378 Agesilaus marched with a large army into Boeotia.  He was unable, however, to effect any
thing decisive, and subsequent invasions were attended with the like result.  The Athenians
created a diversion in their favour by a maritime war, and thus for two years Boeotia was free
from Spartan invasion, Thebes employed this time in extending her dominion over the neighbouring
cities.  One of her most important successes during this period was the victory gained by Pelopidas
over a Lacedaemonian force near Tegyra, a village dependent upon Orchomenus (B.C. 375).  Pelopidas
had with him only the Sacred Band and a small body of cavalry when he fell in with the Lacedaemonians,
who were nearly twice as numerous.  He did not, however, shrink from the conflict on this account;
and when one of his men, running up to him, exclaimed, "We are fallen into the midst of the
enemy," he replied, "Why so, more than they into the midst of us?"  In the battle which ensued
the two Spartan commanders fell at the first charge, and their men were put to the rout.  So
signal a victory inspired the Thebans with new confidence and vigour, as it showed that Sparta
was not invincible even in a pitched battle, and with the advantage of numbers on her side.
By the year 374 B.C. the Thebans had succeeded in expelling the Lacedaemonians from Boeotia,
and revived the Boeotian confederacy.  They also destroyed the restored city of Plataea, and
obliged its inhabitants once more to seek refuge at Athens.

The successes of the Thebans revived the jealousy and distrust of Athens.  Prompted by these
feelings, the Athenians opened negotiations for a peace with Sparta; a resolution which was
also adopted by the majority of the allies.

A congress was accordingly opened in Sparta in the spring of 371 B.C. The Athenians were represented
by Callias and two other envoys; the Thebans by Epaminondas, then one of the polemarchs. The
terms of a peace were agreed upon, by which the independence of the various Grecian cities
was to be recognised; and the Spartan harmosts and garrisons everywhere dismissed.  Sparta
ratified the treaty for herself and her allies; but Athens took the oaths only for herself,
and was followed separately by her allies.  As Epaminondas refused to sign except in the name
of the Boeotian confederation, Agesilaus directed the name of the Thebans to be struck out
of the treaty, and proclaimed them excluded from it.

The peace concluded between Sparta, Athens, and their respective allies, was called the PEACE
OF CALLIAS.  The result with regard to Thebes and Sparta will appear in the following chapter.

CHAPTER XVII.

THE SUPREMACY OF THEBES, B.C. 371-361.

In pursuance of the treaty, the Lacedaemonians withdrew their harmosts and garrisons, whilst
the Athenians recalled their fleet from the Ionian sea.  Only one feeling prevailed at Sparta--a
desire to crush Thebes.  This city was regarded as doomed to destruction; and it was not for
a moment imagined that, single-handed, she would be able to resist the might of Sparta.  At
the time when the peace was concluded Cleombrotus happened to be in Phocis at the head of a
Lacedaemonian army; and he now received orders to invade Boeotia without delay.  The Thebans
on their side, were equally determined on resistance.  The two armies met on the memorable
plain of Leuctra, near Thespiae.  The forces on each side are not accurately known, but it
seems probable that the Thebans were outnumbered by the Lacedaemonians.  The military genius
of Epaminondas, however, compensated any inferiority of numbers by novelty of tactics.  Up
to this time Grecian battles had been uniformly conducted by a general attack in line. Epaminondas
now first adopted the manoeuvre, used with such success by Napoleon in modern times, of concentrating
heavy masses on a given point of the enemy's array.  Having formed his left wing into a dense
column of 50 deep, so that its depth was greater than its front, he directed it against the
Lacedaemonian right, containing the best troops in their army, drawn up 12 deep, and led by
Cleombrotus in person.  The shock was terrible. Cleombrotus himself was mortally wounded in
the onset, and with difficulty carried off by his comrades.  Numbers of his officers, as well
as of his men, were slain, and the whole wing was broken and driven back to their camp.  The
loss of the Thebans was small compared with that of the Lacedaemonians.  Out of 700 Spartans
in the army of the latter, 400 had fallen; and their king also had been slain, an event which
had not occurred since the fatal day of Thermopylae.

The victory of Leuctra was gained within three weeks after the exclusion of the Thebans from
the peace of Callias.  The effect of it throughout Greece was electrical.  It was everywhere
felt that a new military power had arisen--that the prestige of the old Spartan discipline
and tactics had departed.  Yet at Sparta itself though the reverse was the greatest that her
arms had ever sustained, the news of it was received with an assumption of indifference characteristic
of the people.  The Ephors forbade the chorus of men, who were celebrating in the theatre the
festival of the Gymnopaedia, to be interrupted. They contented themselves with directing the
names of the slain to be communicated to their relatives, and with issuing an order forbidding
the women to wail and mourn.  Those whose friends had fallen appeared abroad on the morrow
with joyful countenances, whilst the relatives of the survivors seemed overwhelmed with grief
and shame.

Immediately after the battle the Thebans had sent to Jason of Pherae in Thessaly to solicit
his aid against the Lacedaemonians. This despot was one of the most remarkable men of the period.
He was Tagus, or Generalissimo, of all Thessaly; and Macedonia was partially dependent on him.
He was a man of boundless ambition, and meditated nothing less than extending his dominion
over the whole of Greece, for which his central situation seemed to offer many facilities.
Upon receiving the invitation of the Thebans, Jason immediately resolved to join them. When
he arrived the Thebans were anxious that he should unite with them in an attack upon the Lacedaemonian
camp; but Jason dissuaded them from the enterprise, advising them not to drive the Lacedaemonians
to despair, and offering his mediation.  He accordingly succeeded in effecting a truce, by
which the Lacedaemonians were allowed to depart from Boeotia unmolested.

According to Spartan custom, the survivors of a defeat were looked upon as degraded men, and
subjected to the penalties of civil infamy.  No allowance was made for circumstances.  But
those who had fled at Leuctra were three hundred in number; all attempt to enforce against
them the usual penalties might prove not only inconvenient, but even dangerous; and on the
proposal of Agesilaus, they were, for this occasion only, suspended.  The loss of material
power which Sparta sustained by the defeat was great.  The ascendency she had hitherto enjoyed
in parts north of the Corinthian gulf fell from her at once, and was divided between Jason
of Pherae and the Thebans.  Jason was shortly afterwards assassinated.  His death was felt
as a relief by Greece, and especially by Thebes.  He was succeeded by his two brothers, Polyphron
and Polydorus; but they possessed neither his ability nor his power.

The Athenians stood aloof from the contending parties.  They had not received the news of the
battle of Leuctra with any pleasure, for they now dreaded Thebes more than Sparta.  But instead
of helping the latter, they endeavoured to prevent either from obtaining the supremacy in Greece,
and for this purpose called upon the other states to form a new alliance upon the terms of
the peace of Antalcidas.  Most of the Peloponnesian states joined this new league.  Thus even
the Peloponnesian cities became independent of Sparta.  But this was not all.  Never did any
state fall with greater rapidity.  She not only lost the dominion over states which she had
exercised for centuries; but two new political powers sprang up in the peninsula, which threatened
her own independence.

In the following year (B.C. 370) Epaminondas marched into Laconia, and threatened Sparta itself.
The city, which was wholly unfortified, was filled with confusion and alarm.  The women, who
had never yet seen the face of an enemy, gave vent to their fears in wailing and lamentation.
Agesilaus, however, was undismayed, and saved the state by his vigilance and energy.  He repulsed
the cavalry of Epaminondas as they advanced towards Sparta; and so vigorous were his measures
of defence, that the Theban general abandoned all further attempt upon the city, and proceeded
southwards as far as Helos and Gythium on the coast, the latter the port and arsenal of Sparta
after laying waste with fire and sword the valley of the Eurotas, he retraced his steps to
the frontiers of Arcadia.

Epaminondas now proceeded to carry out the two objects for which his march had been undertaken;
namely, the consolidation of the Arcadian confederation, and the establishment of the Messenians
as an independent community. Behind the gangway whom was of the sanctuary, is Andrew-John did
the chapel, not freely have young very, and being also lower than the s of the Cathedral. The present
to the ancient citizens of the Cathedral is that of Deity-phyllidas, of most aisle of the couch;
it is remarkable for that polemarchs of its columns and for its proclamations of several execution;
it incorporate the grave of a Hasenburg, and the oldest of which
is the of Henry of Deity, who took in 1190. Epaminondas
next proceeded to re-establish the Messenian state.  The Messenians had formerly lived under
a dynasty of their own kings; but for the last three centuries their land had been in the possession
of the Lacedaemonians, and they had been fugitives upon the face of the earth.  The restoration
of these exiles, dispersed in various Hellenic colonies, to their former rights, would plant
a bitterly hostile neighbour on the very borders of Laconia.  Epaminondas accordingly opened
communications with them, and numbers of them flocked to his standard during his march into
Peloponnesus.  He now founded the town of Messene. Its citadel was placed on the summit of
Mount Ithome, which had three centuries before been so bravely defended by the Messenians against
the Spartans.  The strength of its fortifications was long afterwards a subject of admiration.
The territory attached to the new city extended southwards to the Messenian gulf, and northwards
to the borders of Arcadia, comprising some of the most fertile land in Peloponnesus.

So low had Sparta sunk, that she was fain to send envoys to beg the assistance of the Athenians.
This request was acceded to; and shortly afterwards an alliance was formed between the two
states, in which Sparta waived all her claims to superiority and headship.  During the next
two years the Thebans continued steadily to increase their power and influence in Greece, though
no great battle was fought.  In B.C. 368 Pelopidas conducted a Theban force into Thessaly and
Macedonia.  In Thessaly he compelled Alexander, who, by the murder of his two brothers, had
become despot of Pherae and Tagus of Thessaly, to relinquish his designs against the independence
of Larissa and other Thessalian cities, and to solicit peace.  In Macedonia he formed an alliance
with the regent Ptolemy:  and amongst the hostages given for the observance of this treaty
was the youthful Philip, son of Amyntas, afterwards the celebrated king of Macedon, who remained
for some years at Thebes.

In the following year Pelopidas and Ismenias proceeded on an embassy to Persia.  Ever since
the peace of Antalcidas the Great King had become the recognised mediator between the states
of Greece; and his fiat seemed indispensable to stamp the claims of that city which pretended
to the headship.  The recent achievements of Thebes might entitle her to aspire to that position:
and at all events the alterations which she had produced in the internal state, of Greece,
by the establishment of Megalopolis and Messene, seemed to require for their stability the
sanction of a Persian rescript.  This was obtained without difficulty, as Thebes was now the
strongest state in Greece; and it was evidently easier to exercise Persian ascendency there
by her means, than through a weaker power.  The Persian rescript pronounced the independence
of Messene and Amphipolis; the Athenians were directed to lay up their ships of war in ordinary;
and Thebes was declared the head of Greece.

It was, in all probability, during a mission undertaken by Pelopidas and Ismonias, for the
purpose of procuring the acknowledgment of the rescript in Thessaly and the northern parts
of Greece, that they were seized and imprisoned by Alexander of Pherae.  The Thebans immediately
despatched an army of 8000 hoplites and 600 cavalry to recover or avenge their favourite citizen.
Unfortunately, however, they were no longer commanded by Epaminondas.  Their present commanders
were utterly incompetent.  They were beaten and forced to retreat, and the army was in such
danger from the active pursuit of the Thessalians and Athenians, that its destruction seemed
inevitable.  Luckily, however, Epaminondas was serving as a hoplite in the ranks. The monument end in the

of the tyranny of that despot arrived at Thebes, and Pelopidas, who probably also burned to
avenge his private wrongs, prevailed upon the Thebans to send him into Thessaly to punish the
tyrant.  The battle was fought on the hills of Cynoscephalae; the troops of Alexander were
routed: and Pelopidas, observing his hated enemy endeavouring to rally them, was seized with
such a transport of rage that, regardless of his duties as a general, he rushed impetuously
forwards and challenged him to single combat.  Alexander shrunk back within the ranks of his
guards, followed impetuously by Pelopidas, who was soon slain, fighting with desperate bravery.
Although the army of Alexander was defeated with severe loss, the news of the death of Pelopidas
deprived the Thebans and their Thessalian allies of all the joy which they would otherwise
have felt at their victory.
