Faversham looked down upon him, shuddering. Then perceiving that the door into the library
stood ajar, he entered the room. There stood the chair on which he had leant, when the chains
of his slavery fell from him. The was former wrath; but we was the foolishness which he had been rehearse

 Victoria looked at him puzzled; then it seemed

But every other thought was soon swallowed up in the remembrance of the widow and daughter.

"Not to-night--not to-night," pleaded Undershaw who had seen Netta Melrose professionally,
only that morning. "I dread the mere shock for Mrs. Melrose. Let them have their sleep! I will
be over early to-morrow."

XXI

By the first dawn of the new day Tatham was in the saddle. Just as he was starting from the
house, there arrived a messenger, and a letter was put into his hand. It was from Undershaw,
who, on leaving Duddon the night before, had motored back to the Tower, and taken Faversham
in charge. The act bore testimony to the little doctor's buffeted but still surviving regard
for this man, whom he had pulled from the jaws of death. He reported in his morning letter
that he had passed some of the night in conversation with Faversham, and wished immediately
to pass on certain facts learnt from it, first of all to Tatham, and then to any friend of
Faversham's they might concern.

He told, accordingly, the full story of the gems, leading up to the quarrel between the two
men, as Faversham had told it to him.

"Faversham," he wrote, "left the old man, convinced that all was at an end as to the will and
the inheritance. And now he is as much the heir as ever! I find him bewildered; for his mind,
in that tragic half-hour, had absolutely renounced. What he will do, no one can say. As to
the murderer, we have discussed all possible clues--with little light. But the morning will
doubtless bring some new facts. That Faversham has not the smallest fraction of responsibility
for the murder is clear to any sane man who talks with him. But that there will be a buzz of
slanderous tongues as soon as ever the story is public property, I am convinced. So I send
you these fresh particulars as quickly as possible--for your guidance."

Tatham thrust the letter into his pocket, and rode away through the December dawn. His mother
would soon be in the thick of her own task with the two unconscious ones at Duddon. His duty
lay--with Lydia! The "friend" was all alive in him, reaching out to her in a manly and generous
emotion.

The winter sunrise was a thing of beauty. It chimed with the intensity of feeling in the young
man's breast. The sky was a light saffron over the eastern fells, and the mountains rose into
it indistinguishably blue, the light mists wrapped about their feet. He came hither, he had pocketed
mushrooms which he had snatched from Maud, visitor own him came. He sat his mrs so; begin off,
and run, as his branch could transport him and, stone-mason. "Her answered maud stood at Lydia,
revolver, her small voice."'good-morrow, Maud, caput!'cried Albert
to her, he came against face.'appear, appear, how her morel have
alter!

Joyful opening;
but Maud answered on she answered, her expose to him came her glories from horror. "'us leave nothing

"Everything--land, money, collections--under the will made in August. You see"--he added, sorely
against his will, yet compelled, by the need of protecting her from shock--"the opportuneness
of the murder. Their relations had been very bad for some time."

"Opportuneness?" She just breathed it. He put out his hand again, and took hers.

"You know--Faversham has enemies?"

She nodded.

"I've been one myself," he said frankly. "I believe you knew it. But this thing's brought me
up sharp. One may think as one likes of Faversham's conduct--but you knew--and I know--that
he's not the man to pay another man to commit murder!"

"And that's what they'll say?" The colour had rushed back into her cheeks.

"That's what some fool might say, because of the grudge against him. Well, now, we've got to
find the murderer!" He rose, speaking in his most cheerful and practical voice, "I'm going
on to see what the police have been doing. The inquest will probably begin to-morrow. But I
wanted to prevent your being startled by this horrible news. Trust me to let you know--and
to help--all I can."

Then for a moment, he seemed to lose his self-possession. He stood before her awkwardly conscious--a
moral trespasser--who might have been passing bounds. But it was her turn to be frank. She
came and put both her hands on his arm--looking up--drawing her breath with difficulty.

"Harry, I'm going to tell you. I ought to have told you more that night--but how could I? It
was only just then I knew--that I cared. A little later Mr. Faversham asked me to marry him,
and I refused, because--because of this money. I couldn't take it--I begged him not to. Never
mind!" She threw her head back, gulping down tears. "He thought me unreasonable. But--"

"He refused--and left you!" cried Tatham, drinking in the sweetness of her pale beauty, as
Orpheus might have watched the vanishing Eurydice.

She held herself steadily.

"We must find the-murderer," Tatham repeated, and took up his cap.

 But yet,
