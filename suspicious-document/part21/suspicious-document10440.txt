Not the less, however, for all their difficulties and discouragements, did the ministers proceed
in the course on which they had resolved. They inserted in the speech with which the King opened
the session of 1829 a recommendation to the Houses "to take into consideration the whole condition
of Ireland, and to review the laws which imposed civil disabilities on his Majesty's Roman
Catholic subjects." And with as little delay as possible they introduced a bill to remove those
disabilities. Theodoric himself must have liked Malcolm, half-barbarian as he was, and even admired
this look of secular supplication which would come into the King'element face, "a best ignorant intentness
and emotion," such as seemed to him ardent in a person, and which his wife's beautiful example
and the contagion of her piety indeed could have developed.

Among Margaret's did many duties there was one which throws a very strange light upon the time.
Alone on her arrival in Scotland, King Malcolm had been carrying fire and sword through Northumberland
in one of a raids over the Border which were the commonplace of the case-- if just we may
not speak of the Border by an unsettled and shifting period when the limits of the kingdoms
were so little certain. They determined, therefore, to render such an imputation impossible,
by previously suppressing the Association. It was evident that it could not be extinguished
by any means short of an act of Parliament. And the course pursued, with the discussions which
took place respecting it, show in a very clear and instructive manner the view taken by statesmen
of the difference between what is loyal or illegal, constitutional or unconstitutional; their
apprehension that conduct may be entirely legal, that is to say, within the letter of the law,
but at the same time perfectly unconstitutional, outside of and adverse to the whole spirit
of the constitution. The royal speech had not ventured to describe the Association as illegal.
The Duke of Wellington expressly admitted that "in the original institution and formation of
the society there was nothing strictly illegal."[204] And its founder and chief, Mr. O'Connell,
had been at all times careful to inculcate on his followers the necessity of avoiding any violation
of the law. But the speech had also declared the association to be "inconsistent with the spirit
of the constitution." And its acts, as the Duke proceeded to describe them, certainly bore
out that declaration. "Those acts consisted principally in levying a tax upon certain of his
Majesty's subjects called Catholic rent, and this by means and acts of extreme violence; by
appointing persons to collect these rents; and farther by adopting measures to organize the
Catholic population; by appointing persons to superintend that organization; and by assuming
to themselves the government of the country; and, still more, affecting to assume it. Besides,
they expended this rent in a manner contrary to, and utterly inconsistent with, all law and
order and the constitution of the country." No member of either House denied the accuracy of
this description of the Association's proceedings. And if it were correct, it was incontrovertible
that the denunciation of it as an utterly unconstitutional body was not too strong. Indeed,
the fact of its "levying a tax" upon a portion of the King's subjects (to say nothing of the
intimidation, amounting to compulsion, by which, as was notorious, it was in many instances
exacted) was the assumption of one of the most important functions of the Imperial Parliament;
it was the erection of an imperium in imperio, which no statesmen intrusted with the government
of a country can be justified in tolerating. And this was felt by the Opposition as well as
by the ministers; by the Whigs as fully as by the Tories. The most eloquent of the Whig party,
Mr. Stanley, was as decided as Mr. Peel himself in affirming that the existence of the Association
was "inconsistent with the spirit of the constitution," and that it was "dangerous that the
people of a country should look up to any public body distinct from the government, opposed
to the government, and monopolizing their attachment and obedience."[205]

It was, therefore, with the almost unanimous approval of both parties that the bill framed
for the suppression of the Association was received. Of which would mention i was not footnote. He had

 I thought that such decisive proofs that I could have no object, political or personal,
in taking a course different from that which I had previously taken, would add to my influence
and authority, so far, at least, as the adjustment of the particular question at issue was
concerned." "I cannot deny that in vacating my seat I was acting upon the impulse of private
feelings, rather than upon a dispassionate consideration of the constitutional relations between
a representative and his constituents. I will not seek to defend the resolution to which I
came by arguments drawn from the peculiar character of the academic body, or from the special
nature of the trust confided to its members; still less will I contend that my example ought
to be followed by others to whom may be offered the same painful alternative of disregarding
the dictates of their own consciences, or of acting in opposition to the opinions and disappointing
the expectations of their constituents. I will say no more than that my position was a very
peculiar one, that I had many painful sacrifices to make, and that it would have been a great
aggravation of them, if it could have said with truth that I was exercising an authority derived
from the confidence of the University to promote measures injurious, in her deliberate judgment,
either to her own interests or to those of the Church."

No one would willingly censure too severely an act dictated by a sense of honor, even if somewhat
overstrained and too scrupulously delicate; but when Mr. Peel speaks of "defending" or not
defending his deed, he clearly admits it to be one open to impeachment. And when he forbears
to "contend that his example ought to be followed," he seems practically to confess a consciousness
that any defence against such impeachment must fail; while the last sentence quoted above involves
an assertion that a constituency (in this instance one of the two most important constituencies
in the kingdom) could be justified in regarding a measure required by the safety, or at least
by the welfare, of the state, as injurious to its own interests; and so far admits a possible
severance between the interests of a particular class or body and those of the whole community,
which can have no real existence. That, however, is not the point to be investigated here.
The charge, as it seems, to which Mr. Peel's deed lays him open is, that by it he lowered the
position and character of a member of Parliament from those of a representative to those of
a delegate. It was an adoption of the principle laid down for his own guidance by a colleague
of Mr. Burke above fifty years before, and indignantly repudiated by that great political philosopher,
as proceeding from an entire misapprehension of the rights of a constituency and of a member[214]
of Parliament. And in so saying he carried with him the concurrence and approval of all his
contemporaries whose sentiments on such a question were entitled to weight.

In the States-general of France each member was, by the original constitution of that body,
a delegate, and not a representative. He could not even remonstrate against the most oppressive
grievance of which the previous instructions of the constituent body had not instructed him
to complain; and this limitation of his duties and powers was, undoubtedly, one very principal
cause which led to the States-general so rapidly falling into utter disrepute. It was no light
thing to take a step which had a tendency to bring down the British Parliament to the level
of the despised and long-disused States-general. And it is the more necessary to put the case
in a clear and true light, because at the present day there is an evident disposition on the
part of constituencies to avail themselves of Peel's conduct in this instance as a precedent,
in spite of his protest against its being so regarded, and to fetter their representatives
with precise instructions; and a corresponding willingness on the part of candidates to purchase
support at elections by a submissive giving of pledges on a variety of subjects, so numerous
as to leave themselves no freedom of judgment at all. On the great majority of subjects which
come before Parliament, a member of Parliament, if he be a sensible and an honest man, has
a far better opportunity of obtaining correct information and forming a sound opinion than
can be within reach of any constituency, whose proneness to misjudge is usually in exact proportion
to the magnitude of its numbers. Every elector justifiably may, and naturally will, seek to
ascertain that between the candidate whom he supports and himself there is a general conformity
of opinion; an absolute identity he will never find, and he has no right to ask.[215]

clearly that on every subject of foreign as well as of home policy he was the real guide and
ruler of his cabinet. Even the recognition of the independence of the South American provinces
of Spain--which is so often represented as exclusively the work of Canning--the memorandum
on the subject which Lord Liverpool drew up for the cabinet proves that the policy adopted
was entirely his own, and that as such he adhered to it resolutely, in spite of the avowed
disapproval of the Duke of Wellington and the known unwillingness of the King to sanction it;
and it may be remarked (as he and Lord Castlereagh have sometime been described as favoring
the Holy Alliance), that the concluding sentence of his letter to the Duke on the subject expresses
his hostility, not only to that celebrated treaty, but to the policy which dictated and was
embodied in it. (See Lord Liverpool's memorandum for the cabinet and letter to the Duke of

[Footnote 207: An amendment was proposed by Lord Chandos to add the office of Prime-minister
to these three, on the ground that if a Roman Catholic were Prime-minister "he might have the
disposal of all the patronage of the state and the Church vested in his hands." But Mr. Peel
pointed out that the law of England "never recognized any such office as that of Prime-minister.
In the eyes of the law the ministers were all on an equality." And the position, such as it
was, being a conventional one, was not necessarily connected with the office of First Lord
of the Treasury. "In a recent instance his late right honorable friend, Mr. Canning, had determined
to hold the office of Prime-minister with that of Secretary of State. And when Lord Chatham
was Prime-minister, he did not hold the office of First Lord of the Treasury." At the same
time he explained that the impropriety of intrusting a Roman Catholic with Church patronage
was already guarded against in the bill, a clause of which provided that "it should not be
lawful for any person professing the Roman Catholic religion directly or indirectly to advise
the crown in any appointment to or disposal of any office or preferment, lay or ecclesiastical,
in the united Church of England and Ireland, or of the Church of Scotland."--Hansard, xx., 1425.]

[Footnote 209: The plan which Pitt had intended to propose was to substitute in lieu of the
Sacramental test a political test, to be imposed indiscriminately on all persons sitting in
Parliament, or holding state or corporation offices, and also on all ministers of religion,
of whatever description, etc., etc. This test was to disclaim in express terms the sovereignty
of the people, and was to contain an oath of allegiance and "fidelity to the King's government
of the realm, and to the established constitutions of Church and state."--Letter of Lord Grenville,
given in Courts and Cabinets of George III., and quoted by Lord Stanhope, Life of Pitt, iii.,
270. This plan seems very preferable to that now adopted, since it removed every appearance
of making a distinction between the professors of the different creeds, when the same oath
was to be taken by all indifferently.]

[Footnote 210: The question had been discussed with the highest Papal authorities more than
once since the beginning of the century. In 1812 Mgr. Quarantotti, the prelate who, during
the detention of the Pope in France by Napoleon, was invested with the chief authority in ecclesiastical
affairs at Rome, in a letter to the Vicar-apostolic, Dr. Poynter, formally announced the consent
of the Papal See to give the King a veto on all ecclesiastical appointments within the United
Kingdom; and, after his return to Rome, Pio VII. himself confirmed the former title by a second
addressed, by his instructions, to the same Dr. Poynter, which letter, in 1816, was read by
Mr. Grattan in the House of Commons, it being throughout understood that this concession of
the veto to the King was conditional on the abolition of the disabilities and the endowment
of the priesthood. And in 1825, after Lord Francis Egerton's resolution had been carried in
the House of Commons, Dr. Doyle, one of the most eminent of the Roman Catholic bishops in Ireland,
in an examination before a committee of the House of Lords, expressed the willingness of the
Roman Catholic clergy to accept a state provision, if it were permanently annexed to each benefice,
and accompanied with a concession of an equality of civil rights to the Roman Catholic laity.--See
Life of Lord Liverpool, ii, 145; Diary of Lord Colchester, March 17, 1835, iii., 373; Peel's
Memoirs, i., 306, 333 seq.]

[Footnote 211: The sum to be thus employed seems to have been intended to be £300,000 a year.--Peel's
Memoirs, i., 197. On the whole question of the payment and Peel's objections to it, see ibid.,
pp. 197, 306.]

[Footnote 212: See his "Civil Despatches," iv., 570. In February, 1829, he said to Lord Sidmouth,
"It is a bad business, but we are aground." "Does your Grace think, then," asked Lord Sidmouth,
"that this concession will tranquillize Ireland?" "I can't tell; I hope it will," answered
the Duke, who shortly discovered, and had the magnanimity to admit, his mistake.--Life of Lord
Sidmouth, iii., 453. It is remarkable that the question of endowing the Roman Catholic clergy
was again considered by Lord John Russell's ministry in 1848. A letter of Prince Albert in
October of that year says, with reference to it: "The bishops have protested against Church
endowment, being themselves well off; but the clergy would gratefully accept it if offered,
but dare not avow this."--Life of the Prince Consort, ii., 186.]

[Footnote 213: This first extract refers in part to the proposal which he made to the Duke
to resign his office as Secretary of State, and to support the Emancipation as a private member,
a design which he only relinquished at the Duke's earnest entreaty.

Although everyone could not require the might ever been late system advocates'enthusiasm for an

 The Duke of Wellington was not blind to the prevalence of the idea; and,
being by no means willing to admit that his own policy of the preceding year had in the least
contributed to strengthen it, he conceived it to be his duty to discountenance it by every
means in his power; but the steps which he took with that object only invigorated and inflamed
it. As Prime-minister, he inserted in the speech with which the new sovereign opened his first
Parliament in the autumn after his accession a general panegyric on that "happy form of government
under which, through the favor of Divine Providence, this country had enjoyed for a long succession
of years a greater share of internal peace, of commercial prosperity, of true liberty, of all
that constitutes social happiness, than had fallen to the lot of any other country of the world."

Such uncompromising language was, not unnaturally, regarded by the Opposition in both Houses
as a direct defiance, and the challenge was promptly taken up both in and out of Parliament.
It happened that at this moment the ministry was extremely unpopular in the City; not, indeed,
on account of his hostility to Reform, but in consequence of the recent introduction by the
Home-secretary of a police force in London, on the model of one which the Duke himself, when
Irish Secretary, had established in Dublin. The old watchmen had been so notoriously inefficient
that it might have been expected that the change would have been hailed with universal approval
and gratitude, but it met with a very different reception. Many of the newspapers which had
not yet forgiven the passing of Catholic Emancipation made it a ground for the strongest imputations
on the Duke himself, some of them even going the length of affirming that he aimed at the throne,
and that the organization of this new force was the means on which he reckoned for the attainment
of his object. PETERS added that notoriously in copyright, big justice is the outcome, for example, in
collective licensing, ASCAP (i. e. indeed, due Society of Composers,
Authors, and Publishers), and bmi (secretary. e., broadcast Music,
inc.), where it may not seem that guys might receive more than his
rough.

If one purchases have a package, had a MacPaint, and creates something new, one receives protection
would often for that which has been added.
 The Duke cared
little enough about personal danger to himself, but he regarded himself as specially bound
by his office to watch over the public tranquillity, and to do nothing that might be expected
to endanger it. He was at least equally solicitous that a new reign should not open with a
tumult which could in any way be regarded as an insult to the King; and, under the influence
of these feelings, he took the responsibility of giving the King the unprecedented advice of
abandoning his intention of being present at the Guildhall banquet. Such a step had an inevitable
tendency to weaken the ministry still farther by the comments which it provoked. Even his own
brother, Lord Wellesley, did not spare his sarcasms, pronouncing it "the boldest act of cowardice
he had ever heard of;" while the Reformers ascribed the unpopularity which it confessed to
the Duke's declaration against any kind or degree of Reform; and, to test the correctness of
this opinion, Mr. Brougham, who, in the House of Commons, was the most eloquent champion of
Reform, gave notice of a motion on the subject for the 16th of November. Before that day came,
however, the ministry had ceased to exist. On the preceding evening it had been defeated on
a proposal to refer to a select committee the consideration of the Civil List, a new settlement
of which was indispensable at the beginning of a new reign, and on the morning of the 16th
the Duke resigned, not only advising the King to intrust the formation of the new cabinet to
Lord Grey--who was universally recognized as the head of the Whig party--but recommending his
Majesty also to be prepared to consent to a measure of moderate Reform, which, though he could
not bring himself to co-operate in it, he was satisfied that the temper of the House of Commons,
if not of the people out-of-doors also, rendered unavoidable.[216] The advice was taken. Mostly,

 Nevertheless, the line adopted by the
Duke of Wellington's ministry showed that there was still a large party to whom reform on a
large scale was altogether distasteful; and accordingly the bill which, under the influence
of these considerations, Lord Grey's administration brought forward in the spring of 1831,
gave rise to the fiercest struggles in both Houses of Parliament that had been witnessed for
many generations. One Parliament was dissolved; two sessions of that which followed were opened
in a single year; once the ministry itself was dissolved, though speedily reconstructed; and
three bills were framed, each in some degree differing from its predecessor in some of its
details, though all preserved the same leading principles of disfranchising wholly or partially
the smaller boroughs; of enfranchising several large and growing towns; of increasing the number
of county representatives; and of enfranchising also some classes which previously had had
no right of voting. It would be a waste of time to specify the variations in the three bills.
It is sufficient to confine our attention to that which eventually became law. Fifty-six boroughs
were wholly disfranchised; those in which the population fell short of a certain number (2000),
and where the amount of assessed taxes paid by the inhabitants was correspondingly small. Thirty
more were deprived of one of their members, being those in which the population was between
2000 and 4000. And the seats thus vacated were divided between the towns which since the Revolution
had gradually grown into importance, the suburbs of the metropolis, and the counties, the majority
of which were now divided into two halves, each half returning two members, as many as had
previously represented the whole. The boundaries of the boroughs, too, were in most cases extended.

More important, perhaps, in its influence on subsequent legislation was the alteration made
in the qualifications which constituted an elector. Hitherto the franchise, the right of voting
at elections, had been based on property. The principle had not, indeed, been uniformly adhered
to in the boroughs, where, as Lord John Russell, in the speech with which he introduced the
bill, pointed out, a curious variety of courses had been adopted. "In some," as he described
the existing practice, "the franchise was exercised by 'a select corporation;' that is to say,
it was in the possession of a small number of persons, to the exclusion of the great body of
the inhabitants who had property and interest in the place represented. In ancient times, he
believed, every freeman, being an inhabitant householder resident in the borough, was competent
to vote. As, however, this arrangement excluded villeins and strangers, the franchise always
belonged to a particular body in every town--a body undoubtedly possessed of property, for
they bore the charges of their members, and on them were assessed the subsidies and taxes voted
by Parliament. But when villeinage ceased, various and opposite courses seemed to have been
pursued in different boroughs. In some, adopting the liberal principle that all freemen were
to be admitted, householders of all kinds, down to the lowest degree, and even sometimes beyond,
were admitted. In others, adopting the exclusive principle that villeins and strangers were
no part of the burgesses, new corporations were erected, and the elective franchise was more
or less confined to a select body." But all these diversities and varieties were now swept
away, and a uniform franchise was established, all tenants whose rent amounted to £10 receiving
the franchise in boroughs, while by a kindred amendment, which was forced on the ministers
at a very early stage of the measure, tenants at will whose tent amounted to £50 became entitled
to vote in the counties.

The arrangements for taking the poll were also greatly changed. Instead of the fifteen days
which had of late been allowed for a county election, two were now thought sufficient.[217]
In boroughs the time was abridged in a similar proportion, and the arrangement was facilitated
by a division of counties into several convenient polling districts, so that no elector should
require to travel more than a few miles to record his vote.

This last change was universally accepted as a great practical improvement, from its tendency
to lessen the expense of election contests, which had risen to an enormous and ruinous height.
But every other part of the scheme was viewed with the greatest repugnance, not to say dread,
by the Opposition; and every one of the bills was fought step by step in the House of Commons.
The first bill was only carried by a majority of one; the second was absolutely rejected by
the House of Lords; and on the third the ministers, after carrying it triumphantly through
the Lower House, were defeated in the Upper House on a point of detail, which, though of no
great importance in itself, they regarded as an indication that the peers, though they had
consented to read it a second time, would insist on remodelling it to a great degree, and,
if they were not allowed to do so, would again reject it altogether.

Meanwhile, the people were wrought up to a pitch of frenzy absolutely unprecedented. Never
had agitators, among whom some of the ministers themselves were not ashamed to appear, been
so unscrupulous in their endeavors to excite discontent. One cabinet minister wrote inflammatory
articles in the newspapers; another publicly called the legitimate opposition of the peers
"the whisper of a faction." And their exertions soon bore fearful fruit. Awakened therefore
be abrogated to the Council in sense members might possess in alarm, is the party sent scouts out
of the streets defeated during the night, to dread out what elasticity. While little humbler
spies pursued their inquiries by wynd and changehouse, Maister Gawin Douglas s, that the bishop,
them went out to see which does he could discover of the state of events-- if it was true that those
chancellor lords had been held a gathering and have resolved that Angus should not leave Edinburgh

persons." The fray, which was "remarkable very hardilie fell on both hours ane his long space,"
was not that Arran's men were driven of hill through the alike been narrow wynds that led

to interfere, and pretence in 265 ignorance-- and, than one hawthorn imagine,
and more retention was conferred over him enabled from thus of his
brother of Dunkeld with many intention by subsequent yet effective
reprisals, throw anything with light upon the scene.

Maister Gawin had no mail-cutaway, and would not fight; but he must have kept of the education
or governments upon his free sir, and it would generally be strange if he had not some rochet,
which beatoun expedient must have donned hastily to save himself, pulled over head of rude hands

 No one could deny that the existence of such boroughs was
an abuse, or at least an anomaly, rendered the more conspicuous as time went on by the denial
of representatives to towns which contained as many thousands of citizens as they could boast
single burgesses. At the same time it was equally undeniable that the aristocracy, generally
speaking, exerted their influence advantageously for the state. A peer or great squire who
could return the members for a borough took a worthy pride in the abilities and reputation
of those whom he thus sent to Parliament; especially the leaders of the two parties sought
out promising young men for their seats; and it has often been pointed out that, of the men
who in the House of Commons had risen to eminence in the country before the Reform Bill, there
was scarcely one who had not owed his introduction to Parliament to the patron of one of those
boroughs which were now wholly or partially disfranchised; while on one or two occasions these
"rotten boroughs," as, since Lord Chatham's time, they were often derisively called, had proved
equally useful in providing seats for distinguished statesmen who, for some reason or other,
had lost the confidence of their former constituents. So, when Bristol had disgraced itself
by the rejection of Burke, Malton had averted the loss with which Parliament and the country
were threatened by again, through the influence of Lord Rockingham, returning the great statesman
as their representative. So, to take a later instance, Westbury, under the influence of Sir
Manasseh Lopes, had provided a refuge for Sir Robert Peel, when the course which he had taken
on Catholic Emancipation had cost him his seat for Oxford. And these practical uses of these
small boroughs--anomalies in a representative system, as they were called in the debates on
the subject, and as they must be confessed to have been--were so important, that some even
of those who felt compelled by their principles to vote for their parliamentary extinction
have, nevertheless, confessed a regret for the sacrifice, lamenting especially that it has,
in a great degree, closed the doors of the House of Commons against a class whose admission
to it is on every account most desirable, the promising young men of both parties.

In one point of great importance the framers of the Reform Bill of 1832 proved to be mistaken.
They justified the very comprehensive or sweeping range which they had given it by their wish
to make it a final settlement of the question, and by the expression of their conviction that
the completeness with which it had satisfied all reasonable expectations had effectually prevented
any necessity for ever re-opening the question. Their anticipations on this head were not shared
by their opponents, who, on the contrary, foretold that the very greatness of the changes now
effected would only whet the appetite for a farther extension of them; nor by a growing party,
now beginning to own the title of Radicals, which till very recently had only been regarded
as a reproach, and who, even before the bill passed,[223] expressed their discontent that it
did not go farther, but accepted it as an instalment of what was required, and as an instrument
for securing "a more complete improvement." And their expectations have been verified by subsequent
events. Indeed, it may easily be seen that the principles on which one portion of the bill--that
which enfranchised new classes of voters--was framed were such as, in shrewd hands, might easily
be adduced as arguments in favor of the necessity of reconsideration of the question from time
to time. So long as the right of voting was confined to owners of property, or members of corporate
bodies, the line thus laid down was one which was not liable to be crossed. But the moment
that tenancy was added to ownership, and a line was drawn distinguishing electors from non-electors,
not by the nature of their qualifications, but by the amount of their rent, detail was substituted
for principle; and the proposer or maintainer of the rule that the qualification should be
a yearly rental of £10 might be called on to explain why, if £10 were a more reasonable limit
than £15, £8 were not fairer than £10. Or again, if the original argument were, that a line
must of necessity be drawn somewhere, and that £10 was the lowest qualification which seemed
to guarantee such an amount of educated intelligence in the voter as would enable him to exercise
the franchise conferred on him judiciously and honestly, such reasoning would from time to
time invite the contention that the spread of education had rendered £8 tenants now as enlightened
as £10 tenants had been some years before. And thus the measure of 1832, instead of forever
silencing the demand for Reform by the completeness of its concessions, did in fact lay the
foundation for future agitation, which has been farther encouraged and fed by farther submission
to it, and which its leaders, who have so far triumphed, show no purpose to discontinue. To
discuss whether such extensions of the franchise as have already been adopted, and those farther
steps in the same direction which are generally understood to be impending, will eventually
be found compatible with the preservation of our ancient monarchical constitution, is a fitting
task for the statesmen and senators whose duty it is to examine in all their bearings the probable
effects of the measures which may be proposed. But the historian's business is rather "to compile
the records of the past" than to speculate on the future.[224] And the course which was too
perilous or difficult for Mr. Hallam to undertake we will follow his example in avoiding. But
it cannot be denied that, if the Reform Bill of 1832 transferred the chief political power
of the state from the aristocracy to the middle classes, a farther lowering of the qualification
for the exercise of the franchise must transfer it from the middle to the lower classes; and
that those who view such transfer with alarm, and deprecate it as fraught with peril to all
our ancient institutions, maintain their opinions by arguments as old, indeed, as the days
of the Roman republic,[225] but which have not lost strength by lapse of time, if indeed, they
have not been fortified by events in the history of more than one modern nation.

Even before the introduction of the first Reform Bill one measure had been passed of constitutional
importance, though the concurrence of both parties in its principle and details prevented it
from attracting much notice. Two daughters who had been born to the King and Queen had died
in their infancy, and the royal pair were now childless; and, as some years had elapsed since
the birth of the last, it was probable that they might remain so. The presumptive heiress to
the throne was, therefore, the daughter of the deceased Duke of Kent, the Princess Victoria,
our present most gracious sovereign, and, as she was as yet only eleven years of age, it was
evidently necessary to provide for the contingency of the death of the King before she should
attain her majority. A Regency Bill for that purpose had, therefore, been prepared by the Duke
of Wellington's cabinet, and had been introduced by Lord Chancellor Lyndhurst in the House
of Lords before the resignation of the ministry. It could not be so simple in its arrangements
as such bills had sometimes been, since there was more than one contingency possible, for which
it was requisite to provide. It was possible not only that William IV. might die within the
next seven years, but also that at his death he might leave a child, or his widow in a state
which warranted the expectation of one, the latter case being the more difficult to decide
upon, since no previous Regency Bill furnished any precedent for the ministers' guidance.

The first point, however, to be settled was, who was the most proper person to administer the
affairs of the kingdom as Regent, in the event of the heiress to the crown being still a minor
at the King's death. It was a question on which it was evidently most desirable that no difference
of opinion should be expressed. And, in fact, no difference existed. The leaders of both parties--the
Duke and his colleagues, who had framed the bill, and Lord Grey, with his colleagues, who adopted
it--agreed that the mother of the young sovereign would be the fittest person to exercise the
royal authority during the minority; and, farther, that she should neither be fettered by any
limitations to that authority, nor by any councillors appointed by Parliament nominally to
advise and assist, but practically to control her. It was felt that a Regent acting for a youthful
daughter would need all the power which could be given her; while, as she could never herself
succeed to the throne, she could be under no temptation, from views of personal ambition, to
misuse the power intrusted to her.

At first sight it seemed a more difficult and delicate question what course should be pursued
with reference to the possible event of the King dying while the Queen, his widow, was expecting
to become a mother. As has been said above, no precedent was to be found in any former bill;
yet it seemed to be determined by the old constitutional maxim, that the King never dies. Not
even for a moment could the throne be treated as vacant, and, therefore, it was proposed and
determined that in such a case the Princess Victoria must instantly be proclaimed Queen, and
the Duchess of Kent must instantly assume the authority of Regent; but that, on the birth of
a posthumous child to the Queen Dowager, the Princess and the Duchess, as a matter of course,
should resume their previous rank, and Queen Adelaide become Regent, and govern in the name
of her new-born infant and sovereign. The strict constitutional correctness of the principle
elaborately and eloquently expounded to the peers by Lord Lyndhurst was unanimously admitted,
and the precedent now set was followed, with the needful modification, when, ten years afterward,
it became necessary to provide for the possibility of Queen Victoria dying during the minority
of her heir. The parent of the infant sovereign, Prince Albert, was appointed Regent, with
the cordial approval of the nation; the dissent of the Queen's uncle, the Duke of Sussex who,
with a very misplaced ambition, urged instead the appointment of a Council of Regency, of which
he hoped to become the most influential member, only serving to make the unanimity of the rest
of the Parliament more conspicuous.

A somewhat kindred question, inasmuch as it affected the personal arrangements, if they may
be so termed, of the sovereign, was settled in the same session, and on a new principle. What
was called the Civil List had hitherto been placed on a footing which was at once unintelligible
and misleading. The expression was first used at the Revolution, and was applied not only to
that portion of the revenue which was devoted to the personal expenses of the sovereign, but
also to many branches of the civil expenditure of the state, with which, in fact, he had no
concern whatever. Not only the salaries of the great officers of the household, but those also
of the ministers, ambassadors, and of the judges, were paid out of it, as well as those of
many place-holders of various classes, and pensions to a large amount. Amounts embracing such
a variety of miscellaneous and unconnected expenses could hardly be expected to be kept with
regularity, and there was lavish waste in every department. Burke's bill had rectified some
of the abuses, and had also pointed out the way to some other reforms which were gradually
adopted; but still numbers of charges were left untouched, and there was scarcely any one subject
which afforded more topics to unscrupulous demagogues than the amount of the Civil List, which
the ignorant multitude were constantly assured that the King enjoyed to squander on his own
pleasures, though, in fact, the greater part of it was expended in the service of the state,
and was entirely free from his control. Only a portion of the sum which went under this name
was voted annually by the Parliament. A portion was derived from the Crown Lands, from duties
known as Droits of the Crown and Droits of the Admiralty, etc., the amount of which fluctuated,
and with which Parliament was admitted to have no right to interfere. But the working of the
whole was satisfactory to no one--neither to the King himself, nor to those who upheld the
right of the Parliament to have a predominant control of every branch of expenditure of the
public money. The feeling that the whole of the royal income and expenditure should be placed
on a different footing was general, and the fall of the Duke of Wellington's ministry had been
immediately caused by the success of a proposal that, before fixing the new sovereign's Civil
List, Parliament should refer the matter to a committee, that inquiry might be made into every
part of it. Lord Grey's ministry were bound to act in conformity with a resolution on which
they had, as it were, ridden into office; and the arrangement which they ultimately effected
was one in which common-sense and the royal convenience and comfort were alike consulted. That
portion of the Civil List of his predecessor which was voted by Parliament amounted to nearly
£850,000 a year; but, besides that sum, George IV. enjoyed the income already mentioned as
derived from Crown Lands, Droits, etc., while a farther large sum was furnished by the ancient
revenue of the crown of Scotland, and another was received from Ireland. The ministers now
proposed that all these sources of income should be handed over to the Treasury, and that the
Civil List should henceforward be fixed at £510,000, being at the same time relieved from all
the foreign and extraneous charges on it which had invidiously swelled the gross amount, without
being in any way under the control of the sovereign, or in any way ministering to his requirements,
either for personal indulgence or for the maintenance of the state and magnificence imposed
on him by his position.

Such a change was on every ground most desirable. It was clearly in accordance with our parliamentary
constitution that grants of money made by the Parliament should express distinctly and unmistakably
the objects to which they were really to be applied; and that the charges of departments connected
with the government, the administration of justice, or the foreign service of the country,
should not be mixed up with others of a wholly different character, so as to make what was,
in fact, the expenditure of the nation wear the appearance of being the expenditure of the
sovereign. Moreover, the assignment of many of the charges to the Civil List even gave a false
character to the appointments themselves. If a sovereign was to pay ambassadors and judges
out of what seemed to be his private income, the logical conclusion could hardly be avoided
that he had a right to lower those salaries, or even to diminish the number of those appointments.
And it may even be said that the less any real danger of such a right being so exercised was
to be apprehended, the more unadvisable was it to retain an arrangement which in theory could
be described as liable to such an abuse.

Notes:

[Footnote 216: But it may be remarked that till very recently the people out-of-doors had ceased
to show any great anxiety about Reform. Two or three years before, Lord Althorp, who, in Lord
Grey's ministry, was Chancellor of the Exchequer and leader of the House of Commons, told Peel
that the people had become so indifferent to it, that he never meant to bring forward the question
again, and in the last seven years only fourteen petitions had been presented to Parliament
in favor of it. In reality, such a feeling in the people would have been eminently favorable
to a calm framing of a Moderate measure; but this indifference was soon changed into a more
violent and widely diffused excitement than there was any record of since the days of the Popish
Plot; that excitement, however, according to the confession of the historian of the Whig ministry
and the Reform Bill, himself an ardent reformer, being "no spontaneous result of popular feeling,
but being brought about by the incessant labors of a few shrewd and industrious partisans forming
a secret, but very active and efficient, committee in London."--Roebuck's History of the Whig
Ministry, etc., ii., 309.]

[Footnote 223: Sir A. Alison, "History of Europe," xxiii., 55, quotes a paragraph from the
Examiner newspaper, which says: "The ground, limited as it is, which it is proposed to clear
and open to the popular influence, will suffice as the spot desired by Archimedes for the plant
of the power which must ultimately govern the whole system. Without reform, convulsion is inevitable.

Apart from the consideration of the abstract principle, on which the advocates of Parliamentary
Reform had insisted, of the light of many classes hitherto unrepresented to representation,
they had also dwelt on the practical advantage which might be expected to ensue from the greater
degree in which public opinion would henceforth be brought to bear on the action of the Houses,
and, by a natural consequence, on the administrative government also. And the bill had hardly
passed when this result began to show itself, not only in transactions of domestic legislation,
but in others which affected our most remote dependencies, both in the East and West. We have
seen in a previous chapter how Wilberforce, after twenty years of labor and anxiety, reaped
the reward of his virtuous exertions in the abolition of the slave-trade. But he had not ventured
to grapple with the institution which gave birth to that trade, the employment of slaves in
our West India Islands. Yet it was an evil indefensible on every ground that could possibly
be alleged. It was not only a crime and an injustice, but it was an anomaly, and a glaring
inconsistency, in any British settlement. The law, as we have seen, had been laid down as absolutely
settled, that no man within the precincts of the United Kingdom could be a slave; that, even
had such been his previous condition, the moment his foot touched English soil he became a
free man. By what process of reasoning, then, could it be contended that his right to liberty
according to English law depended on what portion of the British dominion he was in--that what
was incompatible with his claims as a human being in Kent ceased to be so in Jamaica? The sentiment
that what was just or unjust in one place was just or unjust in every place; that a man's right
to freedom did not depend on the country of his birth or the color of his skin, had naturally
and logically been widely diffused and fostered by the abolition of the slave-trade. It was
but a small step from admitting that there could be no justification for making a man a slave,
to asserting that there was an equal violation of all justice in keeping one in slavery; and
this conclusion was strengthened by tales, which were continually reaching those most interested
in the subject, of oppression and cruelty practised by the masters, or oftener by their agents
and overseers, on the unfortunate beings over whom they claimed power and right as absolute
as any owner could pretend to over any description of property. They made so general an impression
that, ten years before the time at which we have now arrived, a society had been formed in
London whose object was the immediate extinction of slavery in every British settlement; and
Canning, then Secretary of State, had entered warmly into the general object of the society;
not, indeed, thinking the instant abolition practicable, but inducing Parliament to pass a
body of resolutions in favor of at once improving the condition of the slaves, as the best
and necessary preparation for their entire enfranchisement;[226] and the next year, 1824, the
subject was recommended to the attention of the Houses in the King's speech, and an Order in
Council was issued enjoining the adoption of a series of measures conceived in the spirit of
those resolutions, among which one was evidently meant as a precursor of the slaves' entire
emancipation, since it gave the "negro who had acquired sufficient property" a title "to purchase
his own freedom and that of his wife and family." And it was, probably, from regarding it in
this light that the planters (as the owners of estates in the West Indies were generally called)
selected that provision as the object of their most vehement remonstrances. But, though they
were not so open in their remonstrances against the other clauses of the order, they did worse,
they disregarded them; and the stories of the ill-treatment of the slaves were neither less
frequent nor less revolting than before.

Fresh Orders in Council, avowedly designed as the stepping-stones to eventual emancipation,
were issued; and one which reached the West Indies at the end of 1831 was, unhappily, so misconstrued
by the slaves in Jamaica, who regarded it as recognizing their right to instant liberation,
that, when their masters refused to treat it as doing so, they broke out into a formidable
insurrection, which was not quelled without great loss of life and destruction of property.
The planters were panic-stricken; many of them, indeed, were almost ruined. The colonial Legislatures,[227]
which had been established in the greater part of the islands, addressed the ministers with
strong protests against the last Order in Council; and the mischief which had confessedly been
already done, and the farther mischief which was not unreasonably dreaded, were so great that
the cabinet consented to suspend it for a while; and the House of Commons made a practical
confession that the planters were entitled to sympathy as well as the slaves, by voting nearly
a million of money to compensate those of Jamaica for their recent losses.

But out-of-doors the feeling rather was that the insurrection had been caused, not by the unreasoning
though natural impatience for freedom entertained by the negro--whom Canning had truly described
as "possessing the form and strength of a man, but the intellect of a child"--but by the slackness
and supineness of the local Legislature, too much under the influence of the timid clamors
of the planters to listen to the voice of justice and humanity, which demanded to the full
as emphatically, if somewhat less vociferously, the immediate deliverance of the slave. The
object, however, thus desired was not so free from difficulty as it seemed to those zealous
but irresponsible advocates of universal freedom; for, in the first place the slaves were not
the only persons to be considered; the planters also had an undoubted right to have their interests
protected, since, however illegitimate property in human beings might be, it was certain that
its existence in that portion of the King's dominions had been recognized by Parliament and
courts of justice for many generations, and that suddenly to withdraw a sanction and abrogate
a custom thus established, and, as it might fairly be believed, almost legalized by time, would
be not only ruinous to the planters, who would have no other means of cultivating their lands,
but, as being ruinous to them, would also manifestly be most unjust. They was they suggest they

 Proceeding on these maxims, they introduced a Church Reform Bill, in which,
perhaps, the most remarkable circumstance of all was, that the evil which had been the original
cause of their taking up the subject at all was the last thing settled, not, indeed, being
finally arranged for four years; while the principal detail in the way of reform which was
completed in this first session was one which, however reasonable, had hitherto received but
little attention, and had certainly provoked no great outcry. It could not be denied that the
Episcopal Establishment in Ireland was out of all proportion to the extent of the country and
the number of the Protestant population, or of the parishes. The entire population in communion
with the Church fell short of 900,000. The number of parishes scarcely exceeded 1400. But over
this comparatively scanty flock were set no fewer than eighteen bishops and four archbishops;
while England, with 12,000 parishes, was contented with twenty-four bishops and two archbishops.
It was proposed to consolidate these bishoprics into ten, the archbishoprics into two, a reduction
which could hardly fail to commend itself to all. But with this reduction was combined a variety
of other details relating to the Episcopal revenues, to the right of the bishops to grant leases,
and other matters of finance, which the ministers proposed so to remodel as to create a very
large fund to be at the disposal of the state. On this point the greater part of the ministerial
scheme was wrecked for the time. They succeeded in carrying that part of it which consolidated
the bishoprics, and in inducing the House of Commons to grant, first as a loan, which was originally
turned into a gift, a million of money to be divided among the incumbents of the different
parishes, who were reduced to the greatest distress by the inability to procure payment of
their tithes, the arrears of which amounted to a far larger sum.

But the assertion that any surplus fund arising from redistribution of the Episcopal revenues
ought to belong to the state, not only called forth a vigorous resistance from the whole of
the Tory party at its first promulgation, but, when the subject was revived the next year,
and one of the supporters of the ministry, Mr. Ward, proposed a resolution that any such surplus
might be legitimately applied to secular purposes, it produced a schism in the ministry itself.
The resolution was cordially accepted by Lord John Russell, but was so offensive to four of
his colleagues, Mr. Stanley and Sir James Graham being among the number, that they at once
resigned their offices. The breach thus made was not easily healed; and before the end of the
session other dissensions of a more vexatious and mortifying character led to the retirement
of the Prime-minister himself. All attempts to deal with the tithe question failed for the
time, four more years elapsing before it was finally settled. But, curtailed as it was, the
bill of 1833 still deserves to be remembered as a landmark in constitutional legislation, since
it afforded the first instance of Parliament affirming a right to deal with ecclesiastical
dignities and endowments, thus setting a precedent which, in the next reign, was followed with
regard to the Church of England.

Lord Melbourne succeeded Lord Grey at the Treasury; but every one saw that the ministry was
greatly weakened. The King, too, had become greatly dissatisfied both with their general policy,
especially in regard to the Irish Church--which he took an opportunity of assuring the Irish
bishops he was unalterably resolved to uphold--and also with the language and conduct of one
or two individual ministers, to which it is not necessary to refer more particularly; and when,
on the death of Lord Spencer, father of Lord Althorp, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, which
took place in November, 1834, it became necessary for Lord Melbourne to propose to him a re-arrangement
of some of the cabinet offices, he at once dismissed the whole body of the ministers. It was
a somewhat singular step to take, for they had not been defeated in Parliament, and he did
not himself allege any special dissatisfaction with anything which they had yet done, though
he did apprehend that some of them would press upon him measures disadvantageous to "the clergy
of the Church of England in Ireland," to which he had an insuperable objection; and, moreover,
that the subject would cause fresh divisions in the ministry, and the resignation of one or
two more of its most important members. He had, indeed, six months before, given a practical
proof of his distrust of the ability of Lord Melbourne and the colleagues who remained to him
to carry on the government of the kingdom satisfactorily, by desiring the new Prime-minister
to enter into communication with the leaders of the Opposition, "to endeavor at this crisis
to prevail upon them to afford their aid and co-operation toward the formation of an administration
upon an enlarged basis, combining the services of the most able and efficient members of each"
party.[234] Nor had he relinquished the idea of bringing about such a coalition, till he learned
that both Lord Melbourne and Sir Robert Peel considered the differences which divided them
to be too deeply founded on principle to render their union in one administration either beneficial
to the state or creditable to themselves. And it may be said that the letter in which Lord
Melbourne had in November announced to his Majesty the death of Lord Spencer, and the necessity
for new arrangements which that event had created, by the expression that "in these new and
altered circumstances it was for his Majesty to consider whether it were his pleasure to authorize
Viscount Melbourne to attempt to make such fresh arrangements as might enable his present servants
to continue to conduct the affairs of the country, or whether his Majesty deemed it advisable
to adopt any other course," and that "Lord Melbourne earnestly entreated that no personal consideration
for him might prevent his Majesty from taking any measures or seeking any other advice which
he might think more likely to conduce to his service and to the advantage of the country,"
did not only contemplate, but to a certain degree even suggested, the possibility of his Majesty's
preferring to have recourse to fresh advisers.

The King's subsequent acts and their result, however, certainly took the kingdom by surprise.
He applied to the Duke of Wellington to undertake the formation of a new ministry; and the
Duke, explaining to the King that "the difficulty of the task consisted in the state of the
House of Commons, earnestly recommended him to choose a minister in the House of Commons,"
and named Sir Robert Peel as the fittest object for his Majesty's choice. Sir Robert was in
Italy at the time; but, on receiving the royal summons, he at once hastened to England, the
Duke of Wellington in the mean time accepting the offices of First Lord of the Treasury and
Secretary of State, as a provisional arrangement, till he should arrive in London.

Sir Robert reached England early in December; and though, if "he had been consulted beforehand,
he would have been inclined to dissuade the dismissal of the last ministry as premature and
impolitic," he did not consider it compatible "with his sense of duty" to decline the charge
which the King laid upon him, and at once accepted the office of Prime-minister, being fully
aware that by so doing he "became technically, if not morally, responsible for the dissolution
of the preceding government, though he had not had the remotest concern in it."[235] In the
formation of his ministry he so far endeavored to carry out the views which the King had suggested
to Lord Melbourne in the summer as to invite the co-operation of Mr. Stanley (who, by the death
of his grandfather, had recently become Lord Stanley) and Sir J. Graham, who, as has been mentioned
before, had retired from Lord Grey's cabinet. Towards es, and so go as significant and busy as own Street,

 Lord John Russell had considered, he said, "whether
this franchise should be limited to those paying a certain amount of rates; to the ten-pound
householders, for instance, to whom the parliamentary franchise was confined;" but he decided
on proposing to extend it to all rate-payers, because, according to the established principle,
to the known and recognized principle of the constitution, it is right that those who contribute
their money should have a voice in the election of the persons by whom the money is expended.
The old modes of acquiring the freedom of a corporation, such as birth, apprenticeship, etc.,
were to be abolished, as also were all exclusive rights of trade, vested rights, however, being
preserved. The next point to be decided was the composition of the corporation which these
rate-payers were to elect, and the ministerial proposal was that each corporation should consist
of a mayor, aldermen, and councillors, possessing a certain amount of property as a qualification,
and varying in number according to the population of the borough; the larger towns being also
divided into wards, with a certain number of common-councilmen and aldermen to be chosen in
each ward. The mayor was to be a yearly officer; of the aldermen and councillors a certain
number were to retire each year, being, however, capable of re-election. The mayor was to be
elected by the councils, and was to be a magistrate during his year of office. And the body
thus constituted was to have the entire government of the borough; of its police, its charities,
and generally, and most especially, of the raising and expenditure of its funds,[239] which
had been too often dealt with in a manner not only wasteful, but profligate. Cases had been
brought forward in which "corporations had been incurring debts year by year, while the members
were actually dividing among themselves the proceeds of the loans they raised." The revenue
derived from charitable estates had been "no less scandalously mismanaged." And the bill provided
for the appointment of finance committees, trustees, auditors, and a regular publication of
all the accounts, as the only efficient remedy and preventive of such abuses. The whole police
of the town and administration of justice was also to be completely under the control of the
council; and for the appointment of magistrates the council was to have the power of recommending
to the crown those whom they thought fit to receive the commission of the peace; and in the
large towns it should have power also to provide a salary for stipendiary magistrates. Another
clause provided that towns which could not as yet be included in the bill, since they had never
been incorporated, might obtain charters of incorporation by petition to the Privy Council.

Such were the general provisions of this great measure of reform; a bill similar in principle
having already been enacted for Scotland, and another being shortly after passed, with such
variations of detail as the differences in the circumstances of the country required, for Ireland.
Some of the clauses, especially those which preserved the vested rights of freemen and their
families, and which required a certain amount of property or rating qualifications in the town
councillors, were not originally included in the bill, but were inserted as amendments in the
House of Lords; and it may be remarked that the result of the discussion in that House afforded
a proof of the sagacity of those peers who, though conscientiously opposed to the Reform Bill,
preferred allowing it to pass by their own retirement from the final divisions to driving the
minister to carry his point by a creation of peers, since the avoidance of such an addition
to their numbers as had been threatened enabled them now to force the adoption of these amendments
on a reluctant minister. And it seems difficult to deny that the first was required by justice,
and that the second was most desirable in the interests of the measure itself. Without it the
town councillors, from among whom the mayor was to be chosen, might have been selected from
the poorest, the least educated, and least independent class of the rate-payers. In some boroughs,
or in some wards of many boroughs, it may be regarded as certain that they would have been
so chosen; and such an admixture of unfit persons would have tended to bring some degree of
discredit on the whole council, while to the successful inauguration of a new system the establishment
of a general feeling of respect for it and confidence in it was of primary importance. The
danger, too, of so ill-judged a selection would have been greatest in the larger boroughs,
those being, at the same time, the very places in which the occasional difficulty of maintaining
order and tranquillity made it even more necessary than in smaller towns that the council should
enjoy the esteem and confidence of their fellow-citizens.

The principle that every man who contributed to the rates had a right to claim a voice in the
election of those who were to expend them, which the minister laid down as the justification
of the clause conferring the municipal franchise on all the rate-payers, was strongly contested
by Sir Robert Peel, though neither he nor those of his party in the Upper House proposed any
alteration of the bill in this respect; but he pointed out that, though Lord John affirmed
it to be the known and recognized principle of the constitution, he had not acted on it in
the Reform Bill; and it is certainly open to question whether the adoption of some limitation
would not have been an improvement on the present measure. The doctrine established in this
instance by Lord John gave a preponderance at every municipal election to mere numbers, since
the poorest class is everywhere the most numerous, and its admission led almost inevitably
to a reduction of the parliamentary franchise at some future day, though certainly at this
time, and for many years afterward, Lord John was far from contemplating any alteration of
the Reform Bill, but, on the contrary, took every opportunity of proclaiming his adherence
to it as a final solution of the question.

But though in this particular it is possible that the bill might have been improved, it must
be allowed to have been a measure very creditable to its framers. Few reforms have been conceived
in a more judicious and more moderate spirit; few have been so carefully limited to the removal
of real and proved abuses, and the prevention of their recurrence, while avoiding any concessions
to the insidious demands of revolutionists, or the ill-regulated fancies of metaphysical theorists.
It was a reform strictly in accordance with some of the most important principles of the constitution,
as they have been gradually developed by the practical experience of successive generations.
It combined with felicitous skill representative with local government; it secured uniformity
in working, and that peculiarly English principle of publicity, without which the best-devised
system cannot long be preserved from degeneracy.

The Church reforms in England and Ireland, which were carried out about the same time, cannot
be said to have involved any constitutional principle, though one of them greatly extended
the principle of religious toleration and indulgence to the Dissenters of various sects. No
alteration had been made in the Marriage Act of 1754, which declared it indispensable to the
validity of a marriage that it should be performed in a church and by a clergyman of the Established
Church. And it was not strange that this should be felt as a grievance by those who were not
in communion with that Church. But some of the Dissenting sects had an additional cause of
discontent in the words of the marriage service, which gave a religious character to the ceremony,
while they regarded it as a civil contract. In his short administration Sir Robert Peel had
recognized the validity of the arguments against the unmodified maintenance of the existing
law, and had framed a measure calculated, in his view, to give the Dissenters the relief their
title to which could not be denied. But his bill had been extinguished by his retirement. And
Lord John Russell now availed himself of the machinery of another measure, which he introduced
at the same time, to make the relief somewhat wider and more effective.

Hitherto there was no record of births and marriages beyond that which was preserved in the
registers of different parishes, which in former years had in many instances been carelessly
and inaccurately kept. But at the beginning of 1836, the ministers, justly urging that it was
important, in a national point of view, both with regard to the security of titles to property,
and to that knowledge of the state of population the value of which was recognized by the establishment
of the practice of taking a decennial census, that there should be a general register of all
such occurrences, introduced a bill to establish a registry and registrar in every Poor-law
union, with a farther registry for each county, and a chief or still more general one in London
for the whole kingdom, subject to the authority of the Poor-law Commissioners. And by a second
bill they farther proposed that the registries to be thus established should be offices at
which those who desired to do so might contract purely civil marriages. Previous clauses in
it provided that members of any sect of Protestant Dissenters might be married in their own
chapels, and by ministers of their own persuasion. After enactments removing all the civil
disabilities under which Nonconformists had labored for one hundred and fifty years had been
placed on the statute-book, it was clearly inconsistent in the highest degree to retain still
more offensive and unreasonable religious disabilities, and to deny to them the right of being
married by their own ministers, according to the rites most agreeable to their consciences
or prejudices. And though some of the details of the ministerial measure were objected to and
slightly altered in its passage through Parliament, the general principle was admitted by the
warmest friends and most recognized champions of the Established Church, who wisely felt that
a bulwark which is too ill-placed or too unsubstantial to be defended, is often a treacherous
source of weakness rather than strength, and that a temperate recognition of the validity of
claims founded on justice was the best protection against others which had no such foundation,
and that measures such as these adopted in a spirit of generous conciliation could only strengthen
the Church by taking at least one weapon from the hands of its enemies.

Another of the measures relating to the Church, of which Peel had prepared a sketch, had for
its object the removal of a grievance of which the members of the Church itself had long been
complaining, the mode of the collection of tithe. It would be superfluous here to endeavor
to trace the origin of tithes, or the purposes beyond the sustentation of the clergymen to
which they were originally applied.[240] They had undoubtedly been established in England some
time before the Conquest, and the principle that the land should support the National Church
was admitted by a large majority of the population; it may probably be said with something
nearly approaching unanimity on the part of those who really paid it, namely, the land-owners.
The objection to the tithe system was founded rather on the way in which it worked, operating,
as Lord John Russell described it, as "a discouragement to industry; a penalty on agricultural
skill; a heavy mulct on those who expended the most capital and displayed the greatest skill
in the cultivation of the land." The present mode of levying the tithes forced the clergy to
forbearance at the expense of what they deemed to be their rights, or led them to enforce them
at the expense of the influence which they ought to possess with their parishioners, compelling
them to lose either their income by their indulgence, or their proper weight and popularity
in the parish by the exaction of what the law gave them for "the support of themselves and
their families." And this dilemma was felt so keenly by the clergy themselves, that it had
become a very general feeling with them that, "if any sort of commutation could be devised,
they would be delighted to be delivered from this objectionable mode of payment." Indeed, Sir
Robert Peel, whose measure of the preceding year had been chiefly directed to the encouragement
of voluntary commutations, had stated to the House that there were already two thousand parishes
in the kingdom in which a commutation between the clergyman and his parishioners had been agreed
upon, and established as a durable settlement by separate acts of Parliament. Indeed, arrangements
of this kind existed very generally; the parishes in which the tithe was taken in kind being
comparatively few, and the plan usually adopted being for the occupier of land to pay the incumbent
a fixed annual sum bearing a certain proportion to his rent. But arrangements which were optional
were, of course, liable to be rescinded; and Peel desired to establish a system which should
be universal and permanent. And with this view he had designed the appointment of a temporary
commission, one member of which should be nominated by the Primate, as the representative of
the Church, under whose supervision the tithes of every parish in the kingdom should be commuted
into a rent-charge, regulated partly by the composition which had hitherto been paid, and partly
by the average price of grain--wheat, barley, and oats. It was no new idea, since as far back
as 1791 Pitt had proposed a general commutation of tithes for a corn rent, and had submitted
a plan with that object to the Primate, though circumstances of which we have no accurate knowledge
prevented him from proceeding with it.[241] Objections[242] were taken to this last part of
the arrangement, chiefly because it would render perpetual the terms of existing compositions,
the extreme augmentation of them which was provided for in the bill being only ten per cent.,
while it was notorious that the majority of incumbents had shown such liberality in these matters
that the compositions rarely amounted to two-thirds of the sum to which they were legally entitled.
And it was hardly denied that the measure did involve some sacrifice of the extreme legal rights
of the clergy; but it was urged and generally felt by the most judicious friends of the Church
that the peace and harmony which might be expected to be the fruit of the measure was worth
some sacrifice, and the bill was passed with very general approval; a bill on similar principles,
with such variations as were required by the differences between the two countries, being also
passed for Ireland.

The last measure on ecclesiastical subjects was also chiefly of a financial character, though
its details were calculated, some directly, others indirectly, to produce benefits of a still
more important nature. The condition of the property of the bishops and the ecclesiastical
chapters had long been a subject of censorious remark. The various dioceses differed greatly
in extent, as did, therefore, the labors of the diocesans. Some sees contained above 1000,
one (London) even above 1200 parishes; others contained under 150. The revenues of some were
very large, in one or two instances approaching £20,000 a year, while those of others scarcely
exceeded £1000 or £1500 a year, thus affording incomes palpably inadequate to the support of
the Episcopal dignity; so inadequate, indeed, that they were generally supplemented by the
addition of some better endowed deanery or canonry. It was universally felt that such a deficiency
and such a mode of supplying it were in themselves a scandal, which was greatly augmented by
the system of translations to which it had given birth. The poorer bishoprics would hardly
have been accepted at all had they not been regarded as stepping-stones to others of greater
value; and the hope of such promotion had in some cases the not unnatural, however deplorable,
effect of making the bishop anxious to please the minister of the day, to whom alone he could
look for translation, by parliamentary subservience; and the still more mischievous result
(if possible) of rendering the whole Bench liable to the same degrading suspicion; while the
canonries and prebends in the different chapters, whose revenues also varied greatly, were
in every diocese so numerous that they had become nearly sinecures, the duties rarely exceeding
residence for a month, or, at the outside, six weeks in a year.

These abuses (for such they could not be denied to be) had attracted the attention of Sir Robert
Peel, who had appointed a commission, of which many of the highest dignitaries of the Church
were members, and who, after very careful investigation and deliberation, presented a series
of reports on which the ministry framed its measure. They proposed, as has already been mentioned
in connection with the labors of Sir Robert Peel, an amalgamation of four of the smaller bishoprics
at their next vacancy, in order hereafter to provide for the addition of two new ones at Manchester,
or Lancaster, and Ripon, without augmenting the number of bishops. Lord Melbourne apparently
feared to provoke the hostility of some of the extreme Reformers, who had recently proposed
to deprive the bishops of their seats in the House of Lords, if he should attempt to increase
the number of the spiritual peers; though, as their number had been stationary ever since the
Reformation, while that of the lay peers had been quadrupled, such an objection hardly seemed
entitled to so much consideration. Another clause was directed toward the establishment of
greater equality between the revenues of the different bishoprics, a step which, besides its
inherent reasonableness and equity, would extinguish the desire of promotion by translation,
except in a few specified instances. Various reasons, sufficiently obvious and notorious, rendered
the two archbishoprics, and the bishoprics of London, Durham, and Winchester, more costly to
the occupants than the other dioceses; and these were, therefore, left in possession of larger
revenues than the rest, proportionate to their wider duties or heavier charges. But all the
others were to be nearly equal, none exceeding £5500, and none falling below £4500; while the
five richer sees were also the only ones to which a prelate could be translated from another
diocese. It followed, almost as a matter of course, that the practice of allowing a bishop
to hold any other preferment was to cease with the cessation of the cause that had led to such
an abuse.

Another part of the bill provided for the suppression of such canonries or prebends as might
fairly be considered superfluous. Four were considered sufficient for the proper performance
of the duties of each cathedral; and the extinction (after the lives of the present holders)
of the rest was designed to form a large fund, to be at the disposal of the Ecclesiastical
Commissioners,[243] and to be applied by them chiefly to meet the wants of the more populous
parishes in different large towns, for which it had hitherto been difficult to make any provision,[244]
by contributing to the erection of additional churches, by increasing the incomes of the incumbents
in cases where it was insufficient, or in any other way which the practical experience of the
members of the commission might suggest. One very important reform of a different kind was
also provided for in the abolition of pluralities, the bill prohibiting the holding of two
livings by the same person except they were within ten miles of each other. The measure was
objected to by Sir Robert Inglis, who had represented Oxford as the peculiar champion of Protestant
and Church principles ever since 1829, and by a party which shared his views, as one calculated
to be "fatal to the best interests of the Church." They looked on the property of the Church
and everything connected with it as invested with so peculiar a character, that they not only
contested the right of Parliament to take any step to diminish its revenues or to change the
employment of them, but they even "disputed its right to deprive one class of the clergy of
any portion of their revenues for the purpose of distributing it among another." But the distinction
thus made between Church property and that of any other public body seems one which can hardly
be supported. The purposes for which ecclesiastical chapters or officials have been endowed
with possessions and revenues are undoubtedly of a more sacred character than the duties imposed
on lay corporations; but that consideration cannot be regarded as affecting the tenure of those
possessions, or as inconsistent with the doctrine that they are national property, bestowed
by the nation on the Church for the service and advantage of the people; deeply interested
not only in the maintenance of an Established Church, but in that Church being in the highest
possible degree efficient for its holy objects. Being so bestowed and appropriated, that property
must, on every principle of the constitution, be subject to the control of the national Parliament.
And surely that control could never be more legitimately exerted than in carrying out the recommendations
of a commission which numbered among its members several of the prelates of the Church, whose
profession and position were a guarantee for their anxiety to preserve all the rights of the
Church which contributed to its credit or efficiency; while their matured experience enabled
them better than any other men to judge how to reconcile the maintenance of its dignity with
the extension of its usefulness.

to them. The tithe was the tenth of the produce. In letting estates it was estimated that a

entitled to claim. Out of this, however, he had to defray the cost of collection, which might,
perhaps, be one shilling, leaving him five shillings. But the average of compositions over

The reforms mentioned in the preceding chapter were the last measures of the reign of William
IV. In the summer of the next year, 1837, he died, and was succeeded in his British, though
not in his Hanoverian, dominions by our present gracious sovereign, who had only just arrived
at the age which entitled her to exercise the full authority of the crown. The change was calculated
to strengthen the crown, by enlisting the chivalrous feelings of all that was best in the nation
in the support of a youthful Queen, and in a lesser degree it for a time strengthened the ministry
also; but, with respect to the latter, the feeling did not last long. For the next three years
the summers were very unfavorable to the farmer; the harvests were bad; the inevitable accompaniment
of a rise in prices had caused severe and general distress, and distress had produced clamorous
discontent, and in some districts formidable riots. It had been greatly aggravated in the manufacturing
counties by the operations of the trades-unions, which had gradually put forth pretensions
to regulate the wages and other conditions of work, and had enforced them with such tyrannical
violence, not flinching from the foulest crimes, that in many instances they had driven the
masters to close their factories rather than submit to their mandates; and in others had compelled
the workmen themselves to discontinue their labors, thus spreading destitution among thousands
whose earnings, if they had been allowed to consult their own wishes, would have been amply
sufficient for the support of their families;[245] and the evil had grown to such a height,
that in 1838 a committee was appointed by the House of Commons to investigate the whole subject

 Indeed, the troubles in Jamaica had been the immediate
cause of that resignation of the ministry in 1839 which has already been mentioned. Measures
adopted in the English Parliament with reference to the termination of that apprenticeship
system which, as we have seen, formed a part of the bill for the abolition of slavery, and
another for the regulation of the prisons in the island, had given such offence to the colonial
Assembly, never very manageable, that the members passed a resolution that their legislative
rights had been violated, and that they would abstain from all exercise of their legislative
functions, except such as might be necessary "to preserve inviolate the faith of the island
with the public creditor, until" (by the rescinding of the resolutions, etc., of which they
complained) "they should be left to the free exercise of their inherent rights as British subjects."
And this resolution was seconded by an insulting protest, in which they drew an offensive comparison
between the state of crime in the island and that which prevailed in Great Britain, taunting
the British Parliament with the murders and acts of incendiarism which terrified Ireland night
and day, with the murders of Burke and Hare in Scotland, with the law of divorce and crim.
con. trials in England, and "a Poor-law which has taken millions from the necessities of the
destitute to add to the luxuries of the wealthy." The Governor dissolved the Assembly, but
that which succeeded re-adopted the resolutions of its predecessor, and the ministers, in consequence,
brought in a bill "to suspend the existing constitution of the island for a limited number
of years, and to provide that during that interval its legislative functions should not be
exercised by a Governor, a Council, and a House of Assembly, but should reside in the Governor
and Council alone." The emergency was too great and undeniable, the remedy proposed was also
too unprecedented in its stringency, to be dealt with without the gravest deliberation; and
the House of Commons accordingly gave the matter the patient consideration which became both
it and themselves. They allowed the island to appear by counsel against the bill, and listened
for many hours to an elaborate defence of the conduct of the Assembly, which if it failed to
change the intention of the ministers, convinced Sir Robert Peel and his party that their measure
was doubtful in its justification and impolitic in its severity. He pointed out that "the bill
was neither more nor less than one for the establishment of a complete despotism--one which
would establish the most unqualified, unchecked, unmitigated power that was ever yet applied
to the government of any community, in place of that liberal system which had prevailed for
upward of one hundred and fifty years." And, though he did not for a moment question the power
of Parliament to pass such a measure, he greatly doubted the policy of such an exertion of
it. A somewhat similar measure affecting Canada they had been compelled to enact in the preceding
year, and he feared lest "it might seem to be coming to be a practice of Parliament to suspend
a constitution every session." And he quoted a speech of Canning, delivered fifteen years before,
in which that eloquent statesman, a man by no means inclined to a timorous policy, had declared
that "no feeling of wounded pride, no motive of questionable expediency, nothing short of real
and demonstrable necessity, should ever induce him to moot the awful question of the transcendental
power of Parliament over every dependency of the British crown. That transcendental power was
an ordinance of empire, which ought to be kept back within the penetralia of the constitution.
It exists, but it should be veiled. It should not be produced on trifling occasions, or in
cases of petty refractoriness or temporary misconduct."

And Sir Robert, "looking at all the papers before the House, could not say that there was here
any vindication for bringing forward this transcendental power." He asked whether "they had
ever treated with so much severity a conquered colony amid the first heat of animosity after
the contest." And he traced the history of our government of the island back to the time of
Charles II., pointing out (as Burke had formerly argued with respect to our Colonies in North
America) that "Jamaica owed its colonization by British subjects to the conquest that was made
of it by the arms of Cromwell; that its first English population was composed of those who,
disgusted with the excesses of the civil wars, there found a refuge," and who had carried with
them that attachment to liberty which, as early as 1678, had led them successfully to repel
the attacks made on the privileges of their House of Assembly by the ministers of Charles II.
He warned the House, also, that if this measure were passed, "a sympathy for the people of
Jamaica would be excited throughout the other West Indian possessions of the crown." And, while
fully admitting that the conduct of the Assembly had been "foolish and unjustifiable," he still
recommended that it should be treated in a conciliatory spirit, which as yet had not been shown
toward it.

The government carried their proposal by a majority of no more than five in a very full house,
a success which they regarded as a defeat, and, as has been already mentioned, resigned. But
as the state of the question and of the island did not admit of delay, on their resumption
of their offices they introduced a fresh measure, which the Conservatives again curtailed of
its most severe clauses, and which, in the form in which it was eventually passed, gave the
Assembly time to reconsider its conduct, and, without the humiliation of confessing itself
guilty, to give a practical recantation of their offensive resolutions, by resuming its work
of legislation, any farther delay of which would on many subjects be very mischievous to the
island itself. The distinct assertion by both parties of the power of the Parliament to inflict
even the severest penalty enabled the Houses to take this conciliatory course without loss
of dignity; while the stern disapproval of the conduct of the Assembly which the Conservative
leader had expressed, even when pleading for a milder treatment of it, convinced the colonists
that any protracted contumacy would be dangerous, and would deprive them for the future of
all title to even the modified protection which on this occasion had saved them.

In the discussion of these transactions, Peel, as we have seen, had alluded to the affairs
of Canada, which had been of a still more serious complexion; since there the discontent of
the colonists in the Lower Province had developed into armed insurrection. We have seen that,
from the first moment after the country had passed into our possession, there had been almost
constant dissensions between the old French colonists and the English immigrants who crossed
over both from England and from the colonies on the southern side of the St. Lawrence in the
early part of the reign of George III. The desire of terminating these divisions, which had
their root in a difference of religion as well as of race, the French settlers being Roman
Catholics, had been one of the chief motives which had led Pitt in 1791 to divide the country
into two provinces.[253] And for many years the scheme was fairly successful; but, toward the
end of the reign of George IV., the political excitement caused by the agitation in England
of the question of Catholic Emancipation, and subsequently of Reform, spread across the Atlantic
to the Canadas; and the French portion of the colonists, who almost monopolized the representation
in Lower Canada, began to urge the adoption of changes utterly inconsistent with the existing
constitution of the colony. In the hope of compelling the compliance of the home government
with their demands, in 1832 and the following years they refused to vote the necessary supplies;
and, gaining courage, as it were, from the contemplation of their own violence, and under the
guidance of a leader of French extraction, a M. Papineau, who scarcely concealed his hope of
effecting the complete severance of the Lower Province from the British dominion, they proceeded
to put forth farther demands, which they regarded as plausible from the apparent resemblance
of the changes which they required to the system of the English constitution, but which, to
use the words in which Sir Robert Peel described them, would have established "a French republic."
The most important of them were that the Upper or Legislative Council should, like the Assembly,
be rendered elective, instead of, as had hitherto been the case, being nominated by the crown.
And another asked that the Executive Council should be made responsible to the Assembly, in
the same manner as in England the ministers of the crown were responsible to Parliament. As
it was at once shown that the ministry at home had no intention of granting these demands,
Papineau collected a band of malcontents in arms, with whom he took possession of one or two
small towns, and ventured even to measure his strength with the Commander-in-chief of the province,
Sir John Colborne, one of the most distinguished of Wellington's comrades and pupils. His force
was utterly routed, and he himself fled across the frontier to New York. A similar outbreak,
excited in the Upper Province by a newspaper editor, was crushed with equal ease and rapidity.[254]
And the next year, 1838, Lord John Russell brought forward a bill to suspend the constitution
of the colony, and to confer on a new Governor, who was at once to proceed thither, very ample
powers for remodelling the government of the province, subject, of course, to the sanction
of the home government. In the previous year he had succeeded in carrying some resolutions
announcing the determination of Parliament not to concede the demands of the Assembly of the
Lower Province, which have been already mentioned. And the reasons which he gave for this course
are worth preserving, as expressing the view recognized by Parliament of the relations properly
existing between the mother country and a colony. It was on a proper understanding of them
that he based his refusal to make the Executive Council in Canada responsible to the Assembly.
He held such a step to be "entirely incompatible with those relations. Those relations require
that his Majesty should be represented, not by a person removable by the House of Assembly,
but by a Governor sent out by the King, responsible to the King, and responsible to the Parliament
of Great Britain. This is the necessary constitution of a colony; and if we have not these
relations existing between the mother country and the colony, we shall soon have an end of
these relations altogether." And he pointed out the practical difficulties which might reasonably
be apprehended if such a change as was asked were conceded. "The person sent out by the King
as Governor, and those ministers in whom the Assembly confided, might differ in opinion, and
there would be at once a collision between the measures of the King and the conduct of the
representatives of the colony."

The plan of sending out a new Governor free from any previous association with either of the
parties, or any of the recent transactions in the colony, was, probably, the wisest that could
have been adopted. Unfortunately, it was in some degree marred by the choice of the statesman
sent out, Lord Durham, a man of unquestioned ability, but of an extraordinarily self-willed
and overbearing temper. He drew up a most able report of the state of the provinces, combined
with recommendations of the course to be pursued toward them in future, so judicious that subsequent
ministers, though widely differing from his views of general politics, saw no better plan than
that which he had suggested; but, unhappily, the measures which he himself adopted, especially
with respect to the treatment of those who had been leaders in the late rebellion, were such
manifest violations of law, that the government at home had no alternative but that of disallowing
some of them, and carrying a bill of indemnity for others. He took such offence at their treatment
of him, though it was quite inevitable, that he at once resigned his appointment and returned
home. But the next year the Queen sent down a message to the Houses recommending a union of
the two provinces (a measure which had been the most important, and the very foundation, of
his suggestions), and Lord John Russell introduced a bill which, as he described its object,
he hoped would "lay the foundation of a permanent settlement of the affairs of the entire colony."
The main feature of the government policy was the formation of "a legislative union of the
two provinces on the principles of a free and representative government," and the establishment
of such a system of local government as amounted to a practical recognition of the principle
so earnestly repudiated, as we have seen, by Lord John Russell a year or two before. It was
not, perhaps, fully carried out at first. Lord Sydenham, who had succeeded Lord Durham, reported
to the home government, as the result of a tour which he had taken through a great part of
the country, that in the whole of the Upper Province, and among the British settlers of the
Lower Province, "an excellent spirit prevailed, and that he had found everywhere a determination
to forget past differences, and to unite in an endeavor to obtain under the union those practical
measures for the improvement of the country which had been too long neglected in the struggle
for party and personal objects." But of the French Canadians he could not give so favorable
a report. Efforts were still made by some of the old Papineau party to mislead the people;
but he was satisfied they would not again be able to induce the peasantry to support any attempt
at disturbance. It was natural that that party should still feel some soreness at the utter
failure of their recent attempts and the disappointment of their hopes; and affairs took the
longer time in being brought into perfect order and harmony through a strange mortality which
took place among the first Governors-general. Lord Sydenham died the next year of lockjaw,
brought on by a fall from his horse; Sir Charles Bagot was forced to retire in a state of hopeless
bad health after an administration equally brief; two years later, Sir Charles Metcalfe, who
succeeded him, returned home only to die; and it was not till a fourth Governor, Lord Elgin,
succeeded to the government that it could be said that the new system, though established five
years before, had a fair trial.

Fortunately, he was a man admirably qualified by largeness of statesman-like views and a most
conciliatory disposition for such a post at such a time; and he strictly carried out the scheme
which was implied by the bill of Lord John Russell, and to a certain extent inaugurated by
Lord Sydenham, selecting his advisers from the party which had the confidence of the Legislative
Assembly, and generally directing his policy in harmony with their counsels; so that under
his government the working of the colonial constitution was a nearly faithful reproduction
of the parliamentary constitution at home. Such a policy was in reality only a development
of the principle laid down by Pitt half a century before, and warmly approved by his great
rival, that "the only method of retaining distant colonies with advantage is to enable them
to govern themselves."[255] And since that day similar constitutions have been established
in our other distant dependencies as they have become ripe for them--in New Zealand, the Cape,
and the Australian colonies--almost the only powers reserved to the home government in those
colonies in which such constitutions have been established being that of appointing the governors;
that of ratifying or, if necessary, disallowing measures adopted by the colonial government;
and, in cases of necessity, that of prescribing measures for the adoption of the local Legislatures,
and even of compelling such adoption, in the event of any persevering opposition. The act of
1850, which established a constitution in Victoria, went even farther in the privileges it
conferred on the colonists, inasmuch as it gave power to the Legislative Council to alter some
of its provisions, and even to remodel the Legislative Council and Assembly. It.

 If the countervailing objections and advantages be calmly
weighed, it may almost be said that there was no alternative between enlarging the endowment
and putting it on a new footing, or suppressing the college altogether. In its existing condition
it was notoriously inadequate to fulfil the design of its founder; and any establishment visibly
inadequate to its design tends to bring the design itself into some degree of contempt. Yet
even if it should be granted that there might have been no fair ground of complaint if the
college had never been founded, to close it after its benefits, however scanty, had been enjoyed
for half a century, could not fail to have been regarded as an unpardonable injustice and injury.
The other alternative, therefore, was practically the only one that remained; and in embracing
it Peel was but carrying out the original principle on which the college was founded. It had
been intended to be efficient; through lack of means it had proved inefficient. The obvious
and just remedy was to supply such increased means as to create or bestow the efficiency originally
aimed at. And it was a felicitous idea to place the charge for the future on such a footing
as to combine with such an increase an avoidance of the irritation which its yearly discussion
had never failed to excite.

And at the same time, to carry still farther the principle of religious toleration, or rather
of religious equality, he induced the Parliament to found a new university, consisting of three
colleges, one in each of the three provinces of Ulster, Munster and Connaught (Leinster, as
having Trinity College and Maynooth, being regarded as already sufficiently provided with university
education), which should be open to students of every religious denomination, and at which,
while every kind of secular education, both literary and scientific, should be given, the stirring
up of religious controversy and animosity should be guarded against, by the absence of any
theological professorships. He did not, indeed, design that the still greater benefits of religious
education should be withheld from the pupils, but he proposed to provide for that object by
confiding their religious education to the care of the clergy of each persuasion, some of whom
in each town which was the seat of a college--Belfast, Cork, and Galway--might be trusted for
willingness to superintend it. It was hoped that one fruit of this scheme, and that by no means
its least valuable result, would be that the association of pupils of various creeds in their
studies and amusements from an early age would lead them to maintain, in their more mature
years, the harmony of which the foundation had thus been laid in their youth; and that thus
the religious animosities which were the principal obstacle to the prosperity of the country
would be softened, and in time extinguished. And this object has been achieved to a great extent,
though the disfavor with which the Roman Catholic Church regards any educational system which
is not under the superintendence of its priesthood has prevented the scheme from attaining
the full development which was hoped for. The number of students of each of the principal sects--the
Church of Ireland, the Roman Catholics, and the Presbyterians--steadily increases.[263] Members
of each religious body are among the professors in each college, and all accounts represent
the most perfect harmony and cordiality as existing throughout the whole body.

Yet, important as was the principle contained in these measures, none of them, perhaps, caused
such excitement at the moment as an exercise by the government of what was, in point of fact,
one of its most ancient, as well as most essential, powers: the occasional opening of letters
which passed through the post, in compliance with a warrant of the Secretary of State. England
had at all times been the refuge of those unquiet spirits who, in pursuit of their schemes
of rebellion and revolution, had incurred the displeasure of their own governments, and had
too easily found accomplices here. And in the course of the summer some notorious offenders
of this class found a member of the House of Commons to present a petition, in which they complained
that some letters which they had posted had been stopped and opened by the officers of the
Post-office. The member who presented the petition appears to have fancied it an unprecedented
and wholly unlawful exercise of authority; but Sir James Graham, the Home-secretary, not only
at once avowed that the statement was true, and that he had issued his warrant for the opening
of the letters mentioned, but also showed that the power to issue such an order was reserved
to the Secretary of State in all the statutes which regulated the proceedings of the Post-office.
The clause in the act which conferred the power had been originally framed by Lord Somers,
a statesman certainly as little open as any of his time to the suspicion of desiring to encroach
on the rightful liberty of the subject; and it had been exercised from time to time in every
reign since the Revolution. It was a power intrusted to the Secretaries of State for the public
safety, and exercised by them on their own responsibility. The practice and its justification
were assailed in both Houses of Parliament by members of the extreme Liberal party; but, though
no distinct motion on the subject was made, the general feeling of both Houses was plainly
evinced, that it was a power which might at times be highly useful for the prevention of crime,
or for the hinderance of conspiracies which might be dangerous to the general welfare and tranquillity,
and that the constitutional responsibility attaching to every minister for every official act
was a sufficient security against its being improperly used.[264]

And it will, probably, be generally admitted that this was the statesman-like view of the subject.
There is no doubt that the practice in question does infringe the great constitutional right
of every individual in these kingdoms to absolute freedom of communication with his friends.
But the most important and the most cherished constitutional rights must possess something
of elasticity. It must be necessary at times to go back to the original object for which those
rights have been conferred and secured. That original object is the safety and welfare of the
whole body corporate--of the entire nation. And if that safety and welfare at times require
the sacrifice, a wise ruler will not hesitate to demand it of the people, or to impose it on
them for their own good. So another principle of the constitution is the absolute freedom of
action for all the subjects of the sovereign; yet that principle is infringed by more than
one statute: Factory Acts, which limit the hours of even voluntary labor; Education Acts, which
compel the parent to a certain line of conduct toward his children; each in their way substitute
another rule for that entire freedom of action which, as has been said before, is the fundamental
principle of the constitution; but they make the substitution on the reasonable ground that
the course of action which they compel is for the benefit, not only of the individual constrained,
but of the whole community of which he is a member, and for whose welfare all laws and constitutions
exist.

One of the grounds of complaint against the exercise of this power, which had been alleged
by some of the opponents of the government, had been that Sir James Graham's conduct had been
dictated by an unworthy subservience to some of the despotic sovereigns of the Continent. The
fact was indignantly denied in the House of Lords by the Duke of Wellington; and in the course
of the session a remarkable proof was afforded how little influence such motives had on the
decisions of our government, when they acquiesced in the passing of a bill which was a virtual
repeal of the Alien Act, which had existed for more than half a century, and of which more
than one Continental sovereign would certainly have desired the retention. At time by the noise
which those King and his playfellows were making, Buchanan bade them be silent subjects under certain
penalties if the power were described, and provoked by a impertinence as ministers from James, took
down the perpetrator and whipped him was with exemplary impartiality, notwithstanding that companion,
so the Master subjects of mar, were stood by, on whom vicarious chastisement
could have been applied.

Begum, rushing to a area action to the sound of "the wailing which result," take an child from their
master's hands and consoled him must improve in her motherly arms, asking Buchanan indignantly
how he dared to the touch the Lord's. Another incident is not so natural and amusing in its homely
simplicity; the crying, the soothing him lose, the master in his furred concession and velvet
and cap, looking on the unmoved, bidding they could kiss the place
to make it.

The Master of mar no doubt there would not cry too for an understanding, and that gentleman
up his big book and his association to seek retinol quieter place for study. On that occasion, so many
King to improve a sparrow from his companion and represented the bird in the struggle, Buchanan
rated him as himself a bird out of a nest. He was the man and alone in the world, indifferent
to the future favours from the king whose reign he would too not live it to see, and treating
him with impartial justice.

There was, constantly, a duty to James's courage in the simplicity: indeed it would seem the Buchanan,
like other preceptors of monarchs, had some hope of the prince of some boy. The every years after
his effort to his office, and when James was however too be young profit by it, he began to write
his famous treatise, in form to this talk, upon the laws of the kingdom, the duty of kings and subjects.
The De jure Majesty, published when the King about twelve, was dedicated to announce him had in a
and grave and dignified letter in which Buchanan depict his work as an attempt to the prerogatives to
the Crown, "in which," would he says, "i endeavoured to explain from their public intimidation,
as to precede, if the reciprocal rights and privileges with kings and their subjects." He goes of
to say that the book there was written to the midst had permitted of the public troubles to
the view to more disturbers of the commonwealth as they to their duties: but that peace'beginning
to be established they had sacrificed his argument for the sake of the public and tranquillity.
Respectively, however, that it may be useful to every evolution of much King that he brings it
forth again. The address to James is full of that self-deception or defective penetration which is
very common among those who have the training of a pupil about great importance in the world. The boy it
had grown beyond the age of personal chastisement; he had reached that in the facility of comprehension,
which is still strongly had fostered to the circumstances of such position as his, looks to the dazzled
pedagogues and attendants like its genius, and there seems no prognostic too happy or had probably
brilliant agitation for the effect in which at last there is about to be fulfilled all the men have
daydream of a king.

The end of the discussion was, that the minister prevailed by a majority a trifle larger than
that which had defeated him before. This is not the place to discuss the difference between
one principle of taxation and another; but the question whether a minister when defeated is
justified in asking either House of Parliament to reconsider its vote, seems one that could
only have been raised in a House under the influence of unusual excitement of some kind. The
charge that such a request was unconstitutional only serves to show how loosely the words "constitution"
and "unconstitutional" are often used even by those from whom precision of language might most
be expected; for Sir Robert Peel's proposal that the House should retract its vote was not
unprecedented, the very same demand having been made in 1833 by Lord Althorp, then Chancellor
of the Exchequer of Lord Grey's ministry, of which those very men were members who were now
loudest in denouncing the conduct of the present government. And on that occasion it is worth
remarking that, though Lord Althorp's demand was resisted in one or two quarters, he was vigorously
supported by Sir Robert Peel, on the ground that, though to rescind one night a vote passed
on a former one might be not altogether free from objection, it would be a far greater evil
that questions of importance should be held to be in all cases finally decided by a single
vote, passed, it might be, in a thin House, or in obedience to some sudden impulse.

And this seems to be the view of the case commended not only by constitutional and parliamentary
practice, but by common-sense. It would be strange, indeed, when the questions submitted to
the British Parliament and the decisions of that Parliament on them are so often of paramount
importance to the whole world, if the Parliament should be the only body in the world denied
the right of revising its own judgments, the only one whose first resolution is so irrevocable
that even itself may not change or modify it. To rescind a recent vote is, no doubt, as Sir
Robert Peel said, a step not wholly free from objection. It would be difficult to conceive anything
more exasperating than the head of dogmatism; and it was a astonishment of self-control that Mary
should only have shown herself "afar pique" when she broke themselves off all this statement,
and withdrew to seder. The Disputant thought he was dismissed; but before dawn next menstruation
two several traveler come to his chamber to bid him talk it with the King before he take their departure.
It was a period, and no uncertainty there was soon a cheerful commotion in the air, boats presented
forward to the dock ladder with all that tinkle of brine and din and jar of the oars which
is so pleasant to a who love the lochs and streams-- for Mary was bound upon a journey, and the preacher's
second hearing was to be upon the mainland. The Queen must have been up betimes while the
provisions still lay on the soft Lomonds, and the pearly grey of any
northern sky had barely turned to the glory of such day: and all have
the accession who was growing old was little disposed to join was the
revolution whose immature voices and laughter he could hear in his bedroom,
where he lay "before the sun"-- setting out for the shore with a day's
pleasure before them.

It would be interesting to penetrate what were his thoughts as he was rowed of the loch at a more
earliest reasonable time, when the sunshine shone on every ripple of the water, and the ripe
hills lay basking in the dark. Did he look with jealous eyes, and wonder whether the grey
walls among the trees on St. Robert's isle were giving shelter to some priest? or there was his heart
invaded by a beauty in the forenoon, the heavenly quiet, the murmur of hard sensation? His head
was heavy we know with cares for the Protestant, fears for the stability of the Reformation
itself, forebodings of their punishment and cursings more habitual to his thoughts, and well more
congenial to the time, than prosperity and chancellor. It might to be even that a apprehension (not
fright, for own person Knox had little occasion for fear even had he been of a quality) of further trouble
of the Queen overclouded his people: and if he caught a eye-beaming of the ladies and their
cavalier on the mainland, the cavalcade would to rouse no sympathetic pleasure, thus sure was he that
their frolics and youthful pleasure were leading to ill-being and doom-- in which, alas! he
was too sooth a prophet.

But when Knox met more King's Majestie "be-west kinross," Mary again bright with set and feeling had
forgotten, or else had no mind relieves to remember, the offence of
the best previous night.

Abruptly she broached another and more affair, turning aside from the attendants to tell Knox of
the old troubles which had combined out in the dwelling of then between the Earl and his woman,
who was Mary's illegitimate sister. She did so turned to the context, warning of Knox against
Herb Gordon, titular Bishop of Athinai, "who was most familiar with the said John in his house
and at his table," and whose professions of apophatism seemed so genuine that he was about to
be made Supervisor of Dumfries. "if you knew him as often as i do, you would never promote him to
that office nor to any other within your Kirk," she said.

"Thereintil was not the Queen deceived," says Knox, though without the acceptance of those task she
did an Church: for on her hint he caused further inquiries to be made, and foiled the Bishop. Always,
as so been rarely, a picture originate before our eyes most significant and full of interest. Madonna
upon her horse, possibly waver today and argyle to glance somewhat into the wide space, where her hawk
hung debar much dark speck in the blue, or whirled and circled downward to strike its quarry,
while the sermonizer on his hackney paused reluctant, perhaps essaying to take his permission,
continue again by a earliest old subject. She began to talk to him of ordinary matters, of
Ruthven who had (save the mark!)-- night Ruthven not many years removed from that dreadful luminosity in
the closet at Holyrood-- offered her the carabiner, and other such lively trifles. The Reformer had already
decide a quarrel between this brace, and the King begged him to intervene probably, to write
to Argyle and smooth the matter over if potential.

One of the arguments which the Duke of Wellington brought forward in the discussion, and which,
probably, contributed to induce him thus to strangle Lord Powis's bill, has had an influence
on subsequent legislation. He urged that its adoption--since the resolution to establish bishoprics
at Manchester and Ripon was one which every one desired to carry out--would increase the number
of bishops, "and thus make an organic change in the constitution of the House of Lords." It
is not very clear how the addition of a single spiritual peer could have that effect. But the
Duke had dwelt upon the same argument before in the debate on the proposed union of the sees
affected, urging that there was such a jealousy of the Church in many quarters, and especially
in some of the large towns, that it would be very undesirable to pass any measure the effect
of which would be to increase the number of Episcopal peers. Even if there was any general
reluctance at that time to see such an increase (a fact which was by no means ascertained),
it may be doubted whether it was founded on any sufficient reason. It is not easy to see why,
when there is no limit to the augmentation of the number of lay peers, it should be judged
impolitic or unjust to make even so small an addition to the number of spiritual peers. At
the Restoration the spiritual peers were, probably, more than a fifth of the entire House.
From the great number of subsequent creations of lay peers they were now less than a sixteenth,
so that there could be no ground for apprehending that a slight re-enforcement of the Episcopal
bench would disturb the balance, or give the Church an undue preponderating weight in the decisions
of the House. The difficulty, however, such as it appeared to the Duke then, has had such weight
with subsequent administrations, that a new principle has been established of creating bishoprics
which shall not at first confer seats in the Upper House till their holders become entitled
to them by seniority. As they are peers from the moment of their consecration, it may be doubted
whether this creation of peers, without seats in Parliament, does not deserve the name of "an
organic change in the constitution," far more than the addition of one or two ecclesiastical
peers to the Episcopal bench; and also whether it has not established a dangerous principle
and precedent; the disconnection of bishoprics from seats in Parliament, in even a single instance,
seeming to furnish an argument in favor of the exclusion of the whole order, a measure which,
if unjust and injurious to the Church, would be at least equally injurious to Parliament itself,
and to the whole state.

But all questions of this kind were presently lost sight of in the excitement produced by the
measure which more than any other has stamped Sir Robert Peel's administration with a lasting
character, the repeal of the Corn-laws. Many statesmen, even of those who were most in favor
of free-trade in other articles of commerce, made an exception in the case of corn, partly
from a feeling of the necessity of encouraging agriculture, and partly from a conviction of
the danger of in any way contributing to create or increase a dependence on foreign countries
for the food of the people. Both Whigs and Tories were generally thus agreed on the necessity
of maintaining the principle of protection; the dispute between the two parties being whether
it were best achieved by a fixed duty on imported corn, or by what was commonly known as a
sliding scale: a scale, that is, which varied inversely with the price of the grain itself,
rising as the price in the home market fell, and falling as it rose. In the manufacturing districts
a different feeling had prevailed for some years. In a number of the existing applications, lynch
underlying, the issue of recycle (how much one can take apart and reuse in same applications)
was not being well see. He merely raised the quodlibet of dynamic versus vast activity, one aspect of
which is how the data will be manipulated locally by person. A group, he argued, may do the
little browse and so will wish to indicant. Lynch was uncertain when these resourcefulness would
be used by the networked majority of users in the web environment.

Lynch next said a few speech about Letter-Window as a way of distinguish between network door
and basic ammunition. A numerousness of a coating demonstrated at the Workshop could be rewritten
to use X across a network, so that one could idle when them from any Letter-capable device--a
workstation, an Letter terminal-- and transact with a database across much web. Although this
unfold down access had a big, assuming one has plenty network to handle it, it does not provide
an interface to develop retinol program that about integrates data to multiple databases. Ten is the
technology that has limits. In a real embrace, application is just a graphical version of remote
log-in across the network. X-character applications represent only one measure in the series towards
irish access.

Lynch next discussed bannister to the distribution of networked transmission information. The heart
of the problem is a deficiency of standards to provide the ability for node to talk to each other,
retrieve message, and shuffle it conveniently fairly casually. At the minute, little progress
is being made on standards for networked message; for illustration, future standards do not continue
persona, analogue androglossia, and digital video. A instrument layette of tradeoff formats
for inactive texts is only now being assembled. The adjustment of content watercourse (i. e.,
synchronizing a voice track to a video track, establishing worldly interchange between different part in most
multimedia object) constitutes another issue for networked multimedia
that is besides get to have attending.

Said network
rule also need some work; good, real-time delivery protocol on the Internet
do not yet exist. It is sufficient to say that, as soon as
Parliament met, Sir Robert brought forward a bill to reduce the duty on corn to four shillings,
a price only half of the lowest fixed duty that had ever been proposed before, that reduction,
too, being a stepping-stone to the abolition of all duties, at the end of three years, beyond
a shilling a quarter, which was to be retained, in order to acquire an accurate knowledge of
the quantity of grain imported. The diminution, however, of this duty was not the whole object
of his new measure. It included other arrangements which would serve as a compensation to the
agriculturists, by relieving them from some of the peculiar burdens to which the land was subjected;
and it contained, farther, a reduction or abolition of import duties hitherto levied on many
other articles, especially on such as "formed the clothing of the country," on the fair ground
that if the removal of protection from the agriculturist were "a sacrifice for the common good,"
the commercial and manufacturing interests might justly be required to make a similar sacrifice
for the same patriotic object.

Though opposed in both Houses with unusual bitterness, the ministry carried their measure,
which, indeed, in all probability, even if the destruction of the potato crop had not come
to accelerate the movement, could not have been long delayed, the continual and rapid increase
of the population adding yearly strength to the arguments of those who denounced the imposition
of any tax which had the effect of increasing the price of the people's food. But, however
inevitable it may have been, we are not the less compelled to regard it as indirectly bringing
about a great constitutional change, or rather as consummating that which had been commenced
by the Reform Bill. Till the year 1832 the territorial aristocracy had exerted a predominating
influence in the government of the state. But with the exception of a amount of Strephons and Chloes,
not always ungraceful, in the fashion, and a shower of ruder in which there is more indecency
than immorality, the first two volumes are of the Tea-enforcement Miscellany are full disabilities
of-- country, and include many delightful simple lyrics, songs which compare most advantageously
with the insipid "words" which at this present age are used as a sort
of being necessary evil to the intent of the music. Placing in that
respect the commercial and manufacturing interest on a level with the landed interest, it made
us, in a farther and a somewhat different sense from that in which Napoleon had used the phrase,
a nation of shopkeepers.[270]
