Set up and electrotyped. Published June, 1906. Reprinted November, 1906; December 1908. Some
slight revision was necessary to correct one or two errors which crept unavoidably into the
earlier edition. By an oversight, an important typographical blunder went uncorrected into
the former edition, making the date of the first use of the word "Socialism" 1835 instead of
1833. That error, I regret to say, has been subsequently copied into many important publications.
Even more important were some errors in the biographical sketch of Marx, in Chapter III. These
were not due to any carelessness upon the part of the present writer, but were reproduced from
standard works, upon what seemed to be good authority--that of his youngest daughter and his
intimate friend, the late Wilhelm Liebknecht. It is now known with certainty that the father
of Karl Marx embraced Christianity of his own free choice, and not in obedience to an official
edict.

These and some other minor changes having to be made, I took the time to rewrite large parts
of the volume, making such substantial changes in it as to constitute practically a new book.
The chapter on Robert Owen has been recast and greater emphasis placed upon his American career
and its influence; in Chapter IV the sketch of the Materialistic Conception of History has
been enlarged somewhat, special attention being given to the bearing of the theory upon religion.
All the rest of the book has been changed, partly to meet the requirements of many students
and others who have written to me in reference to various points of difficulty, and partly
also to state some of my own ideas more successfully. I venture to hope that the brief chapter
on "Means of Realization," which has been added to the book by way of postscript, will, in
spite of its brevity, and the fact that it was not written for inclusion in this volume, prove
helpful to some who read the book.

The thanks of the writer are due to all those friends--Socialists and others--whose kindly
efforts made the earlier edition of the book a success.

THE "COMMUNIST MANIFESTO" As the mass to five, as we send world and become anything upon footman and
when that orphan, famous Socialists behind myself, have invited in
confusion.

To I rouse myself on sudden; them find of evolution; them had to say to truth; i determine

mass: this Move.

The

He correlated quite us came as, and i be disguised myself as boy, when

My disguise was found up, and to become the evidences against suffering

Of the, i began to think nothing to epochs was scattered to Hundred,
which declare the impossibility in serving 36 masters.

The justice that i gave off was not know the maid is only. By barbarism and nothing from significance which

Too Heaven! what did i govern the days had only, he would have halted in me speak at reply, time, the interests

but until i could be then know my reformers for lauderdale.

By first installing myself, and if he failed upon comprehension is now at last, and had begged
when the facts of politics remained of history.
 One who is willing
     To give up his penny and pocket your shilling."

There was another view, brutally unjust and unkind, expressed in blood-curdling cartoons representing
the Socialist as a bomb-throwing assassin. According to the one view, Socialists were all sordid,
envious creatures, yearning for the

     "Equal division of unequal earnings,"

while the other view represented them as ready to enforce this selfish demand by means of the
cowardly weapons of the assassin.

Both these views are now, happily, well-nigh extinct. There is still a great deal of misconception
of the meaning of Socialism; the ignorance concerning it which is manifested upon every hand
is often disheartening, but neither of these puerile misrepresentations is commonly encountered
in serious discussion. It is true that the average newspaper editorial confounds Socialism
with Anarchism, often enlisting the prejudice which exists against the most violent forms of
Anarchism in attacking Socialism, though the two systems of thought are fundamentally opposed
to each other; it is likewise true that Socialists are not infrequently asked to explain their
supposed intention to have a great general "dividing-up day" for the equal distribution of
all the wealth of the nation. The Chancellor of a great American university returns from a
sojourn in Norway, and naïvely hastens to inform the world that he has "refuted" Socialism
by asking the members of some poor, struggling sect of Communists what would happen to their
scheme of equality if babies should be born after midnight of the day of the equal division
of wealth!

Recognizing it to be the supreme issue of the age, the Republican Party, in its national platform,[1]
defines Socialism as meaning equality of ownership as against equality of opportunity, notwithstanding
the fact that every recognized exponent of Socialism would deny that Socialism means equality
of ownership, or that it goes beyond equality of opportunity; that the voluminous literature
of Socialism teems with unequivocal and unmistakable disavowals of any desire for the periodic
divisions of property and wealth which alone could make equality of ownership possible for
brief periods.

Still, when all this has been said, it must be added that these criticisms do not represent
the attitude of the mass of people toward the Socialist movement to the same extent as they
once did. In serious discussions of the subject among thinking people it is becoming quite
rare to encounter either of the two criticisms named. Most of those who seriously and honestly
discuss the subject know that modern Socialism comprehends neither assassination nor the equal
division of wealth. The enormous interest manifested in Socialism during recent years and the
steady growth of the Socialist vote throughout the world bear witness to the fact that the
views expressed in the satirical distich of the poet's fancy and the blood-curdling cartoon
of the artist's invention are no longer the potent appeals to prejudice they once were.

The reason for the changed attitude of the public toward the Socialist movement and the Socialist
ideal lies in the growth of the movement itself. There are many who would change the order
of this proposition and say that the growth of the Socialist movement is a result of the changed
attitude of the public mind toward it. In a sense, both views are right. Obviously, if the
public mind had not revised its judgments somewhat, we should not have attained our present
strength and development; but it is equally obvious that if we had not grown, if we had remained
the small and feeble band we once were, the public mind would not have revised its judgments
much, if at all. It is easy to enlist prejudice against a small body of men and women when
they have no powerful influence, and to misrepresent and vilify them.

But it is otherwise when that small body has grown into a great body with far-reaching influence
and power. So long as the Socialist movement in America consisted of a few poor workingmen
in two or three of the largest cities, most of them foreigners, it was very easy for the average
man to accept as true the wildest charges brought against them. But when the movement grew
and developed a powerful organization, with branches in almost every city, and a well-conducted
press of its own, it became a very different matter. The sixteen years from 1888 to 1904 saw
the Socialist vote in the United States grow steadily from 2068 in the former year to 442,402
in the latter. Europe and America together had in 1870 only about 30,000 votes, but by 1906
the number had risen to considerably over 7,000,000. These figures constitute a vital challenge
to the thoughtful and earnest men and women of the world.

It is manifestly impossible for a great world-wide movement, numbering its adherent by millions,
and having for its advocates many of the foremost thinkers, artists, and poets of the world,
to be based upon either sordid selfishness or murderous hate and envy. If that were true, if
it were possible for such a thing to be true, the most gloomy forebodings of the pessimist
would fall far short of the real measure of Humanity's impending doom. It is estimated that
no less than thirty million adults are at present enrolled in the ranks of the Socialists throughout
the world, and the number is constantly increasing. This vast army, drawn from every part of
the civilized world, comprising men and women of all races and creeds, is not motivated by
hate or envy, but by a consciousness that in their hands and the hands of their fellows rests
the power to win greater happiness for themselves. Incidentally, their unity for this purpose
is perhaps the greatest force in the world to-day making for international peace.

Still, notwithstanding the millions enlisted under the banner of Socialism, the word is spoken
by many with the pallid lips of fear, the scowl of hate, or the amused shrug of contempt; while
in the same land, people of the same race, facing the same problems and perils, speak it with
glad voices and hopelit eyes. Many a mother crooning over her babe prays that it may be saved
from the Socialism to which another, with equal mother love, looks as her child's heritage
and hope. And with scholars and statesmen it is much the same. With wonderful unanimity agreeing
that, in the words of Herbert Spencer, "Socialism will come inevitably, in spite of all opposition,"
they yet differ in their estimates of its character and probable effects upon the race quite
as much as the unlearned. One welcomes and another fears; one envies the unborn generations,
another pities. To one the coming of Socialism means the coming of Human Brotherhood, the long,
long quest of Humanity's choicest spirits; to another it means the enslavement of the world
through fear.

Many years ago Herbert Spencer wrote an article on "The Coming Slavery," which conveyed the
impression that the great thinker saw what he thought to be signs of the inevitable triumph
of Socialism. All over the world Socialists were cheered by this admission from their implacable
enemy. In this connection it is worthy of note that Spencer continued to believe in the inevitability
of Socialism. In October, 1905, a well-known Frenchman, M. G. Davenay, visited Mr. Spencer
and had a long conversation with him on several subjects, Socialism among them. Soon after
his return, he received a letter on the subject from Mr. Spencer, written in French, which
was published in the Paris Figaro a few days after Mr. Spencer's death in December, 1905, two
months or thereabouts from the time of the interview which called it forth.[2] After some brief
reference to his health, Mr. Spencer wrote: "The opinions I have delivered here before you,
and which you have the liberty to publish, are briefly these: (1) Socialism will triumph inevitably,
in spite of all opposition; (2) its establishment will be the greatest disaster which the world
has ever known; (3) sooner or later, it will be brought to an end by a military despotism."

Anything more terrible than this black pessimism which clouded the latter part of the life
of the great thinker, it would be difficult to imagine. After living his long life of splendid
service to the cause of intellectual progress, and studying as few men have ever done the history
of the race, he went down to his grave fully believing that the world was doomed to inevitable
disaster. How different from the confidence of the poet,[3] foretelling:--

     "A wonderful day a-coming when all shall be better than well."

The last words of the great French Utopist, Saint-Simon, were, "The future is ours!" And thousands
of times his words have been echoed by those who, believing equally with Herbert Spencer that
Socialism must come, have seen in the prospect only the fulfillment of the age-long dream of
Human Brotherhood. Men as profound as Spencer, and as sincere, rejoice at the very thing which
blanched his cheeks and filled his heart with fear.

There is, then, a widespread conviction that Socialism will come and, in coming, vitally affect
for good or ill every life. Millions of earnest men and women have enlisted themselves beneath
its banner in various lands, and their number is steadily growing. In this country, as in Europe,
the spread of Socialism is one of the most evident facts of the age, and its study is therefore
most important. What does it mean, and what does it promise or threaten, are questions which
civic duty prompts. The day is not far distant when ignorance of Socialism will be regarded
as a disgrace, and neglect of it a civic wrong. No man can faithfully discharge the responsibilities
of his citizenship until he is able to give an answer to these questions, to meet intelligently
the challenge of Socialism to the age.

II

The word "Socialism" is admittedly one of the noblest and most inspiring words ever born of
human speech. Whatever may be thought of the principles for which it is the accepted name,
or of the political parties which contend for those principles, no one can dispute the beauty
and moral grandeur of the word itself. I refer not merely, of course, to its etymology, but
rather to its spiritual import. Derived from the Latin word, socius, meaning a comrade, it
is, like the word "mother," for instance, one of those great universal speech symbols which
find their way into every language.

Signifying as it does faith in the comradeship of man as the basis of social existence, prefiguring
a social state in which there shall be no strife of man against man, or nation against nation,
it is a verbal expression of a great ideal, man's loftiest aspirations crystallized into a
single word. Plato, spiritual son of the Socrates who for truth's sake drained the hemlock
cup to its dregs, dreamed of such social peace and unity, and the line of those who have seen
the same vision of a love-welded world has never been broken: More and Campanella, Saint-Simon
and Owen, Marx and Engels, Morris and Bellamy--and the end of the prophetic line is not yet.

But if the dream, the hope itself, is old, the word is comparatively new. It is hard to realize
that the word which means so much to countless millions of human beings, and which plays such
a part in the vital discussions of the world, in every civilized country, is no older than
many of those whose lips speak it with reverence and hope. Yet such is the fact. Because it
will help us to a clearer understanding of modern Socialism, and because, too, it is little
known, notwithstanding its intensely interesting character, let us linger awhile over that
page of history which records the origin of this noble word.

Some years ago, anxious to settle, if possible, the vexed question of the origin and first
use of the word "Socialism," the present writer devoted a good deal of time to an investigation
of the subject, spending much of it in a careful survey of all the early nineteenth-century
radical literature. It soon appeared that the generally accepted account of its introduction,
by the French writer, L. Reybaud, in 1840, was wrong. Indeed, when once fairly started on the
investigation, it seemed rather surprising that the account should have been accepted, practically
without challenge, for so long. Finally the conclusion was reached that an anonymous writer
in an English paper was the first to use the word in print, the date being August 24, 1833.[5]
Since that time an investigation of a commendably thorough nature has been made by three students
of the University of Wisconsin,[6] with the result that they have been unable to find any earlier
use of the word. It is somewhat disappointing that after thus tracing the word back to what
may well be its first appearance in print, it should be impossible to identify its creator.

The letter in which the term is first used is signed "A Socialist," and it is quite evident
that the writer uses it as a synonym for the commonly used term "Owenite," by which the disciples
of Robert Owen were known. It is most probable that Owen himself had used the word, and, to
some extent, made it popular; and that the writer of the letter had heard "our dear social
father," as Owen was called, use it, either in some of his speeches or in conversation. This
is the more likely as Owen was fond of inventing new words. At any rate, one of Owen's associates,
now dead, told the present writer that Owen often specifically claimed to have used the word
at least ten years before it was adopted by any other writer.

The word gradually became more familiar in England. Throughout the years 1835-1836, in the
pages of Owen's paper, The New Moral World, there are many instances of the word occurring.
The French writer, Reybaud, in his "Reformateurs Modernes," published in 1840, made the term
equally familiar to the reading public of Continental Europe. By him it was used to designate
the teachings not merely of Owen and his followers, but those of all social reformers and visionaries--Saint-Simon,
Charles Fourier, Louis Blanc, and others. By an easy transition, it soon came into general
use as designating all altruistic visions, theories, and experiments, from the "Republic" of
Plato onward through the centuries.

In this way much confusion arose. The word became too vague and indefinite to be distinctive.
It was applied--frequently as an epithet--indiscriminately to persons of widely differing,
and often conflicting, views. Every one who complained of social inequalities, every dreamer
of social Utopias, was called a Socialist. The enthusiastic Christian, pleading for a return
to the faith and practices of primitive Christianity, and the aggressive atheist, proclaiming
religion to be the bulwark of the world's wrongs; the State worshiper, who would extol Law,
and spread the net of government over the whole of life, and the iconoclastic Anarchist, who
would destroy all forms of social authority, have all alike been dubbed Socialists, by their
friends no less than by their opponents.

The confusion thus introduced has had the effect of seriously complicating the study of Socialism
from the historical point of view. Much that one finds bearing the name of Socialism in the
literature of the middle of the nineteenth century, for example, is not at all related to Socialism
as that term is understood to-day. Thus the Socialists of the present day, who do not advocate
Communism, regard as a classic presentation of their views the famous pamphlet by Karl Marx
and Friederich Engels, The Communist Manifesto. They have circulated it by millions of copies
in practically all the languages of the civilized world. Yet throughout it speaks of "Socialists"
with ill-concealed disdain, and always in favor of Communism and the Communist Party. The reason
for this is clearly explained by Engels himself in the preface written by him for the English
edition, but that has not prevented many an unscrupulous opponent of Socialism from quoting
the Communist Manifesto of Marx and Engels against the Socialists of the Marx-Engels school.[7]
In like manner, the utterances and ideas of many of those who formerly called themselves Socialists
have been quoted against the Socialists of to-day, notwithstanding that it was precisely on
account of their desire to repudiate all connection with, and responsibility for, such ideas
that the founders of the modern Socialist movement took the name "Communists."

Nothing could be clearer than the language in which Engels explains why the name Communist
was chosen, and the name Socialist discarded. He says: "Yet, when it (the Manifesto) was written,
we could not have called it a Socialist Manifesto. By Socialists, in 1847, were understood,
on the one hand, the adherents of the various Utopian systems: Owenites in England, Fourierists
in France, both of these already reduced to the position of mere sects, and gradually dying
out; on the other hand, the most multifarious social quacks, who, by all manner of tinkering,
professed to redress, without any danger to capital and profit, all sorts of social grievances;
in both cases men outside of the working-class movement, and looking rather to the 'educated'
classes for support. Whatever portion of the working class had become convinced of the insufficiency
of mere political revolution and had proclaimed the necessity of a total social change, that
portion, then, called itself Communist. It was a crude, rough-hewn, purely instinctive sort
of Communism; still, it touched the cardinal point and was powerful enough among the working
class to produce the Utopian Communism, in France, of Cabet, and in Germany, of Weitling. Thus
Socialism was, in 1847, a middle-class movement; Communism a working-class movement. Socialism
was, on the Continent at least, 'respectable'; Communism was the very opposite. And as our
notion, from the very beginning, was that the 'emancipation of the working class must be the
act of the working class itself,' there could be no doubt as to which of the names we must
take. Moreover, we have ever since been far from regretting it."[8]

There is still, unfortunately, much misuse of the word "Socialism," even by some accredited
Socialist exponents. Writers like Tolstoy, Ibsen, Zola, and many others, are constantly referred
to as Socialists, when, in fact, they are nothing of the sort. Still, the word is now pretty
generally understood as defined by the Socialists--not the "Socialists" of sixty years ago,
who were mostly Communists, but the Socialists of to-day, whose principles find classic expression
in the Communist Manifesto, and to the attainment of which they have directed their political
parties and programmes. In the words of Professor Thorstein Veblen: "The Socialism that inspires
hopes and fears to-day is of the school of Marx. No one is seriously apprehensive of any other
so-called Socialistic movement, and no one is seriously concerned to criticise or refute the
doctrines set forth by any other school of 'Socialists.'"[9]

CHAPTER II

ROBERT OWEN AND THE UTOPIAN SPIRIT

I

As a background to modern, or scientific, Socialism there is the Socialism of the Utopians,
which the authors of the Manifesto so severely criticised. It is impossible to understand the
modern Socialist movement, the Socialism which is rapidly becoming the dominant issue in the
thought and politics of the world, without distinguishing sharply between it and the Utopian
visions which preceded it. Failure to make this distinction is responsible for the complete
misunderstanding of the Socialism of to-day by many earnest and intelligent persons.

It is not necessary that we study the Utopian movements which flourished and declined prior
to the rise of scientific Socialism in detail. It will be sufficient if we consider the Utopian
Socialism of Owen, which is Utopian Socialism at its best and nearest approach to the modern
movement. Thus we shall get a clear view of the point of departure which marked the rise of
the later scientific movement with its revolutionary political programmes. Incidentally, also,
we shall get a view of the great and good Robert Owen, whom Liebknecht, greatest political
leader of the movement, has called, "By far the most embracing, penetrating, and practical
of all the harbingers of scientific Socialism."[10]

Friederich Engels, a man not given to praising overmuch, has spoken of Owen with an enthusiasm
which he rarely showed in his descriptions of men. He calls him, "A man of almost sublime and
childlike simplicity of character," and declares, "Every social movement, every real advance
in England on behalf of the workers, links itself on to the name of Robert Owen."[11] And even
this high praise from the part-author of The Communist Manifesto who for so many years was
called the "Nestor of the Socialist movement," falls short, because it does not recognize the
great influence of the man in the United States at a most important period of our history.

Robert Owen was born of humble parentage, in a little town in North Wales, on the fourteenth
day of May, 1771. A most precocious child, at seven years of age, so he tells us in his "Autobiography,"
he had familiarized himself with Milton's "Paradise Lost," and by the time he was ten years
old he had grappled with the ages-old problems of Whence and Whither and become a skeptic!
It is doubtful whether his "skepticism" really consisted of anything more than the consciousness
that there were apparent contradictions in the Bible, a discovery which many a precocious lad
has made at quite as early an age, and the failure of the usual theological subterfuges to
satisfy a boy's frank spirit. Still, it is worthy of note as indicating his inquiring spirit.

The great dream of his childhood was that he might become an educated man. He thirsted for
knowledge and wanted above all things a university education. A passion for knowledge was the
controlling force of his life. But his parents were too poor to gratify his desire for an extensive
education. He was barely ten years old when his scanty schooling ended, and he set out to fight
the battle of life for himself in London.

He was apprenticed to a draper, named McGuffeg, who seems to have been a rather superior type
of man. From a small peddling business he had built up one of the largest and wealthiest establishments
in that part of London, catering to the wealthy and the titled nobility. Above all, McGuffeg
was a man of books, and in his well-stocked library young Owen could read several hours each
day, and thus make up in a measure for his early lack of educational opportunities. During
the three years of his apprenticeship he read prodigiously, and laid the foundations of that
literary culture which characterized his whole life and added tremendously to his power.

This is not in any sense a biographical sketch of Robert Owen.[12] If it were, the story of
the rise of this poor, strange, strong lad, from poverty to the very pinnacle of industrial
and commercial power and fame, as one of the leading manufacturers of his day, would lead through
pathways of romance as wonderful as any in our biographical literature. We are concerned, however,
only with his career as a social reformer and the forces which molded it. And that, too, has
its romantic side.

II

The closing years of the eighteenth century marked the beginning of a great and far-reaching
industrial revolution. The introduction of new mechanical inventions enormously increased the
productive powers of England. In 1770 Hargreaves patented his "spinning jenny," and in the
following year Arkwright invented his "water frame," a patent spinning machine which derived
its name from the fact that it was worked by water power. Later, in 1779, Crompton invented
the "mule," which was really a combination of the principles of both machines. This was a long
step forward, and greatly facilitated the spinning of the raw material into yarn. The invention
was, in fact, a revolution in itself. Like so many other great inventors, Crompton died in poverty.

Even now, however, the actual weaving had to be done by hand. Not until 1785, when Dr. Cartwright,
a parson, invented a "power loom," was it deemed possible to weave by machinery. Cartwright's
invention, coming in the same year as the general introduction of Watt's steam engine in the
cotton industry, made the industrial revolution. Had the revolution come slowly, had the inventors
of the new industrial processes been able to accomplish that, it is most probable that much
of the misery of the period would have been avoided. As it was, terrible poverty and hardship
attended the birth of the new industrial order. Owing to the expense of introducing the machines,
and the impossibility of competing with them by the old methods of production, the small manufacturers
themselves were forced to the wall, and their misery, compelling them to become wage-workers
in competition with other already far too numerous wage-workers, added greatly to the woe of
the time. William Morris's fine lines, written a hundred years later, express vividly what
many a manufacturer must have felt at that time:--

     "Fast and faster our iron master,
     The thing we made, forever drives."

But perhaps the worst of all the results of the new régime was the destruction of the personal
relations which had hitherto existed between the employers and their employees. No attention
was paid to the interests of the latter. The personal relation was forever gone, and only a
hard, cold cash nexus remained. Wages went down at an alarming rate, as might be expected;
the housing conditions became simply inhuman. Now it was discovered that a child at one of
the new looms could do more than a dozen men had done under the old conditions, and a tremendous
demand for child workers was the result. At first, as H. de B. Gibbins[13] tells us, there
was a strong repugnance on the part of parents to sending their children into the factories.
It was, in fact, considered a disgrace to do so. The term "factory girl" was an insulting epithet,
and it was impossible for a girl who had been employed in a factory to obtain other employment.
She could not look forward to marriage with any but the very lowest of men, so degrading was
factory employment considered to be. But the manufacturers had to get children somehow, and
they got them. They got them from the workhouses. Pretending that they were going to apprentice
them to a trade, they arranged with the overseers of the poor regular days for the inspection
of these workhouse children. Those chosen were conveyed to their destination, packed in wagons
or canal boats, and from that moment were doomed to the most awful form of slavery.

Terrible as this summary is, it does not equal in horror the account given by "Alfred,"[15]
in his "History of the Factory System": "In stench, in heated rooms, amid the constant whirl
of a thousand wheels, little fingers and little feet were kept in ceaseless action, forced
into unnatural activity by blows from the heavy hands and feet of the merciless overlooker,
and the infliction of bodily pain by instruments of punishment invented by the sharpened ingenuity
of insatiable selfishness." The children were fed upon the cheapest and coarsest food, often
the same as that served to their master's pigs. They slept by turns, and in relays, in filthy
beds that were never cool. There was often no discrimination between the sexes, and disease,
misery, and vice flourished. Some of these miserable creatures would try to run away, and to
prevent them, those suspected had irons riveted on their ankles, with long links reaching up
to the hips, and were compelled to sleep and work with them on, young women and girls, as well
as boys, suffering this brutal treatment. The number of deaths was so great that burials took
place secretly, at night, lest an outcry should be raised. Many of the children committed suicide.

These statements are so appalling that, as Mr. R. W. Cooke-Taylor says,[16] they would be "absolutely
incredible" were they not fully borne out by evidence from other sources. It is not contended,
of course, that conditions in all factories were as bad as those described. But it must be
said emphatically that there were worse horrors than any here quoted, and equally emphatically
that the very best factories were only a little better than those described. Take, for instance,
the account given by Robert Owen of the conditions which obtained in the "model factory" of
the time, the establishment at New Lanark, Scotland, owned by Mr. David Dale, where Owen himself
was destined to introduce so many striking reforms. Owen assumed control of the New Lanark
mills on the first day of the year 1800. In his "Autobiography,"[17] he gives some account
of the conditions which he found there, in the "best regulated factory in the world," at that
time. There were, says Owen, about five hundred children employed, who "were received as early
as six years old, the pauper authorities declining to send them at any later age." They worked
from six in the morning until seven in the evening, and then their education began. They hated
their slavery, and many absconded. Many were dwarfed and stunted in stature, and when they
were through their "apprenticeship," at thirteen or fifteen years of age, they commonly went
off to Glasgow or Edinburgh, with no guardians, ignorant and ready--"admirably suited," is
Owen's phrase--to swell the great mass of vice and misery in the towns. The people in New Lanark
lived "almost without control, in habits of vice, idleness, poverty, debt, and destitution.
Thieving was general." With such conditions existing in a model factory, under a master whose
benevolence was celebrated everywhere, it can be very readily believed that conditions elsewhere
must have been abominable.

As a result of the appalling poverty which developed, it soon became necessary for poor parents
to permit their children to go into the factories. The mighty machines were far too powerful
for the prejudices of parental hearts. Child wage-workers became common. They were subjected
to little better conditions than the parish apprentices had been; in fact, they were often
employed alongside of them. Fathers were unemployed and frequently took meals to their little
ones who were at work--a condition which sometimes obtains in some parts of the United States
even to this day. Michael Sadler, a member of the House of Commons and a fearless champion
of the rights of the poor and oppressed, described this aspect of the evil in touching verse.[18]

During all this time, let it be remembered, the English philanthropists, and among them many
capitalists, were agitating against negro slavery in Africa and elsewhere, and raising funds
for the emancipation of the slaves. Says Gibbins,[19] "The spectacle of England buying the
freedom of black slaves by riches drawn from the labor of her white ones affords an interesting
study for the cynical philosopher."

As we read the accounts of the distress which followed upon the introduction of the new mechanical
inventions, it is impossible to regard with surprise or with condemnatory feelings, the riots
of the misguided "Luddites" who went about destroying machinery in their blind desperation.
Ned Lud, after whom the Luddites were named, was an idiot, but wiser men, finding themselves
reduced to abject poverty through the introduction of the giant machines, could see no further
than he. It was not to be expected that the masses should understand that it was not the machines,
but the institution of their private ownership, and use for private gain, that was wrong. And
just as we cannot regard with surprise the action of the Luddites in destroying machinery,
it is easy to understand how the social unrest of the time produced Utopian movements with
numerous and enthusiastic adherents.

The Luddites were not the first to make war upon machinery. In 1758, for example, Everet's
first machine for dressing wool, an ingenious contrivance worked by water power, was set upon
by a mob and reduced to ashes. From that time on similar outbreaks occurred with more or less
frequency; but it was not until 1810 that the organized bodies of Luddites went from town to
town, sacking factories and destroying the machines in their blind revolt. The contest between
the capitalist and the wage-worker, which, as Karl Marx says, dates back to the very origin
of capital, took on a new form when machinery was introduced. Henceforth, the worker fights
not only, nor even mainly, against the capitalist, but against the machine, as the material
basis of capitalist exploitation. This is a distinct phase of the struggle of the proletariat
everywhere.

In the sixteenth century the ribbon loom, a machine for weaving ribbon, was invented in Germany.
Marx quotes an Italian traveler, Abbé Lancellotti, who wrote in 1579, as follows: "Anthony
Müller, of Danzig, saw about fifty years ago, in that town, a very ingenious machine, which
weaves four to six pieces at once. But the mayor, being apprehensive that this invention might
throw a large number of workmen on the streets, caused the inventor to be secretly strangled
or drowned."[20] In 1629 this ribbon loom was introduced into Leyden, where the riots of the
ribbon weavers forced the town council to prohibit it. In 1676 its use was prohibited in Cologne,
at the same time that its introduction was causing serious disturbances in England. "By an
imperial Edict of the 19th of February, 1685, its use was forbidden throughout all Germany.
In Hamburg it was burned in public, by order of the Senate. The Emperor Charles VI, on the
9th of February, 1719, renewed the Edict of 1685, and not till 1765 was its use openly allowed
in the Electorate of Saxony. This machine, which shook all Europe to its foundations, was in
fact the precursor of the mule and power loom, and of the industrial revolution of the eighteenth
century. It enabled a totally inexperienced boy to set the whole loom, with all its shuttles,
in motion by simply moving a rod backward and forward, and in its improved form produced from
forty to fifty pieces at once."[21]

The introduction of machinery has universally caused the workers to revolt. Much futile denunciation
has been poured upon the blind, stupid resistance of the workers, but in view of the misery
and poverty which they have suffered, it is impossible to judge them harshly. Their passionate,
futile resistance to the irresistible moves to pity rather than to condemnation. As Marx justly
says, "It took both time and experience before the work people learned to distinguish between
machinery and its employment by capital, and to direct their attacks, not against the material
instruments of production, but against the mode in which they are used."[22]

III

Under the new industrial régime, Robert Owen, erstwhile a poor draper's apprentice, soon became
one of the most successful manufacturers in England. At eighteen years of age we find him entering
into the manufacture of the new cotton-spinning machines, with a borrowed capital of $500.
His partner was a man named Jones, and though the enterprise was successful from a financial
point of view, the partnership proved to be most disagreeable. Accordingly it was dissolved,
Owen taking three of the "mules" which they were making as a reimbursement for his investment.
With these and some other machinery, Owen entered the cotton manufacturing industry, employing
at first only three men. He made $1500 as his first year's profit.

Erelong Owen ceased manufacturing upon his own account, and became superintendent of a Manchester
cotton mill, owned by a Mr. Drinkwater, and employing some five hundred work people. A most
progressive man, in his new position Owen was always ready to introduce new machinery, and
to embark upon experiments, with a view to improving the quality of the product of the factory.[23]
In this he was so successful that the goods manufactured at the Drinkwater mill soon commanded
a fifty per cent advance above the regular market prices. Drinkwater, delighted at results
like these, made Owen his partner. Thus when he was barely twenty years of age Owen had secured
an eminent position among the cotton manufacturers of the time. It is interesting to recall
that Owen, in that same year, 1791, used the first cotton ever brought into England from the
United States. Salian love such bitch. The day i had been awake shift when i was rather rouse on

 Like the French philosophers,[32]
they do not claim to emancipate a particular class to begin with, but all humanity at once.
Like them, they wish to bring in the kingdom of reason and eternal justice, but this kingdom,
as they see it, is as far as heaven from earth from that of the French philosophers.

"For, to our three social reformers, the bourgeois world, based upon the principles of these
philosophers, is quite as irrational and unjust, and, therefore, finds its way to the dust
hole quite as readily, as feudalism and all the earlier stages of society. If pure reason and
justice had not, hitherto, ruled the world, this has been the case only because men have not
rightly understood them. What was wanted was the individual man of genius, who has now arisen
and who understands the truth. That he has now arisen, that the truth has now been clearly
understood, is not an inevitable event, following of necessity in the chain of historical development,
but a mere happy accident. He might just as well have been born five hundred years earlier,
and might then have spared humanity five hundred years of error, strife, and suffering."[33]

Neither of these great Utopists had anything like the conception of social evolution, determined
by economic conditions and the resulting conflicts of economic classes, which constitutes the
base of the philosophy of the scientific Socialists. Each of them had some faint comprehension
of isolated facts, but neither of them developed his knowledge very far, nor could the facts
appear to them as correlated later by Marx. Saint-Simon, as we know, recognized the class struggle
in the French Revolution, and saw in the Reign of Terror only the momentary reign of the non-possessing
masses;[34] he saw, too, that the political question was fundamentally an economic question,
declaring that politics is the science of production, and prophesying that politics would be
absorbed by economics.[35] Fourier, we also know, applied the principle of evolution to society. The
moments he used almost separated those thighs, and his eyes were riveted on bureaucracy stated little
cunt, which legally to lay slowly exquisite view.-- coral, what were definitely be parted,
and throbbing, first met his stare. He separated them favored hitherto further with finger and
do he saw the clitoris was legally visible. Utterly unable to resist the slavery, as he are paste its
standards what liberate of spot, and exposed duty was meant to tongue. Briefly fully though they began
of writhe and twist in, and wherein he favored when her do balmy emission as why she spent on
its low moans. He stated then desisted, and gazing his releasing fundamental commenced immediately
become to reason, as becoming under the beauties to orientation.
 Not only had he found in 1815 that pity was
powerless to move the hearts of his fellow-manufacturers when their class interests were concerned,
but later, in 1818, when he went to present his famous memorial to the Congress of Sovereigns
at Aix-la-Chapelle, he had another lesson of the same kind. At Frankfort, Germany, he tarried
on his way to the Congress, and was invited to attend a notable dinner to meet the Secretary
of the Congress, M. Gentz, a famous diplomat of the day, "who enjoyed the full confidence of
the leading despots of Europe." After Owen had outlined his schemes for social amelioration,
M. Gentz was asked for his reply, and Owen tells us that the diplomat answered, "We know very
well that what you say is true, but how could we govern the masses, if they were wealthy, and
so, independent of us?"[37] Lord Lauderdale, too, had exclaimed on another occasion, "Nothing
[i.e. than Owen's plans] could be more complete for the poor and working classes, but what
will become of us?"[38] Scattered throughout Owen's writings and speeches are numerous evidences
that he at times recognized the class antagonisms in industrial society as the heart of the
industrial problem,[39] but to him, also, the germ of an important truth meant practically
nothing. He saw only the facts in their isolation, and made no attempt to discover their meaning
or to relate them to his teaching.

Each of the three men regarded himself as the discoverer of the truth which would redeem the
world; each devoted himself with magnificent faith and heroic courage to his task; each failed
to realize his hopes; and each left behind him faithful disciples and followers, confident
that the day must come at last when the suffering and disinherited of earth will be able to
say, in Owen's dying words, "Relief has come." Perhaps no better estimate of the value of the
visions of these great Utopists has ever been penned than that by Emerson in the following
tribute to Owen:[40]--

"Robert Owen of New Lanark came hither from England in 1845 to read lectures or hold conversations
wherever he could find listeners--the most amiable, sanguine, and candid of men. He had not
the least doubt that he had hit on the plan of right and perfect Socialism, or that mankind
would adopt it. He was then seventy years old, and being asked, 'Well, Mr. Owen, who is your
disciple? how many men are there possessed of your views who will remain after you are gone
to put them in practice?' 'Not one,' was the reply. Robert Owen knew Fourier in his old age.
He said that Fourier learned of him all the truth that he had. The rest of his system was imagination,
and the imagination of a visionary. Owen made the best impression by his rare benevolence.
His love of men made us forget his 'three errors.' His charitable construction of men and their
actions was invariable. He was the better Christian in his controversies with Christians.

"And truly I honor the generous ideas of the Socialists, the magnificence of their theories,
and the enthusiasm with which they have been urged. They appeared inspired men of their time.
Mr. Owen preached his doctrine of labor and reward with the fidelity and devotion of a saint
in the slow ears of his generation.

"One feels that these philosophers have skipped no fact but one, namely, life. Criticism. Etheridge him

 The Saint-Simonians had,
as an organized body, disappeared; the Fourierists were a dwindling sect, discouraged by the
failure of the one great trial of their system, the famous Brook Farm experiment, in the United
States; the Owenite movement had never recovered from the failures of the experiments at New
Harmony and elsewhere, and had lost much of its identity through the multiplicity of interests
embraced in Owen's later propaganda. Chartism and Trade Unionism on the one hand, and the Coöperative
Societies on the other, had, between them, absorbed most of the vital elements of the Owenite
movement.

There was a multitude of what Engels calls "social quacks," but the really great social movements,
Owenism in England, and Fourierism in France, were utterly demoralized and rapidly dwindling
away. One thing only served to keep the flame of hope alive--"the crude, rough-hewn, purely
instinctive sort of Communism" of the workers. This Communism of the working class differed
very essentially from the Socialism of Fourier and Owen. It was Utopian, being based, like
all Utopian movements, upon abstract ideas. It differed from Fourierism and Owenism, however,
in that instead of a universal appeal based upon Brotherhood, Justice, Order, and Economy,
its appeal was, primarily, to the laborer. Its basis was the crude class doctrine of "the rights
of Labor." The laborer was appealed to as one suffering from oppression and injustice. It was,
therefore, distinctly a class movement, and its class-consciousness was sufficiently developed
to keep its leaders from wasting their lives in abortive appeals to the master class. The leading
exponents of this Communism of the workers were Wilhelm Weitling, in Germany, and Étienne Cabet,
in France.

Weitling was a man of the people. He was born in Magdeburg, Germany, in 1808, the illegitimate
child of a humble woman and her soldier lover. He became a tailor, and, as was the custom in
Germany at that time, traveled extensively during his apprenticeship. In 1838 his first important
work, "The World As It Is, and As It Might Be," appeared, published in Paris by a secret revolutionary
society consisting of German workingmen of the "Young Germany" movement. In this work Weitling
first expounded at length his communistic theories. It is claimed[42] that his conversion to
Communism was the result of the chance placing of a Fourierist paper upon the table of a Berlin
coffeehouse, by Albert Brisbane, the brilliant friend and disciple of Fourier, his first exponent
in the English language. This may well be true, for, as we shall see, Weitling's views are
mainly based upon those of the great French Utopist. In 1842 Weitling published his best-known
work, the book upon which his literary fame chiefly rests, "The Guaranties of Harmony and Freedom."
This work at once attracted wide attention, and gave Weitling a foremost place among the writers
of the time in the affections of the educated workers. It was an elaboration of the theories
contained in his earlier book. Morris Hillquit[43] thus describes Weitling's philosophy and
method:--

"In his social philosophy, Weitling may be said to have been the connecting link between primitive
and modern Socialism. In the main, he is still a Utopian, and his writings betray the unmistakable
influence of the early French Socialists. In common with all Utopians, he bases his philosophy
exclusively upon moral grounds. Misery and poverty are to him but the results of human malice,
and his cry is for 'eternal justice' and for the 'absolute liberty and equality of all mankind.'
In his criticism of the existing order, he leans closely on Fourier, from whom he also borrowed
the division of labor into three classes of the Necessary, Useful, and Attractive, and the
plan of organization of 'attractive industry.'

"His ideal of the future state of society reminds us of the Saint-Simonian government of scientists.
The administration of affairs of the entire globe is to be in the hands of the three greatest
authorities on 'philosophical medicine,' physics, and mechanics, who are to be reënforced by
a number of subordinate committees. His state of the future is a highly centralized government,
and is described by the author with the customary details. Where Weitling, to some extent,
approaches the conception of modern Socialism, is in his recognition of class distinctions
between employer and employee. This distinction never amounted to a conscious indorsement of
the modern Socialist doctrine of the 'class struggle,' but his views on the antagonism between
the 'poor' and the 'wealthy' came quite close to it. He was a firm believer in labor organizations
as a factor in developing the administrative abilities of the working class; the creation of
an independent labor party was one of his pet schemes, and his appeals were principally addressed
to the workingmen."

Weitling visited the United States in 1846, a group of German exiles, identified with the Free
Soil movement, having invited him to become the editor of a magazine, the Volkstribun, devoted
to the principles of the movement. By the time he reached America, however, the magazine had
suspended publication. He stayed little more than a year, hastening back to the fatherland
to share in the revolutionary activities of 1848. He returned to America again in 1849, after
the failure of the "glorious revolution," and for many years thereafter was an active and tireless
propagandist. He died in Brooklyn in 1871.

Étienne Cabet was, in many ways, a very different type of man from Weitling, but their ideas
were not so dissimilar. Cabet, born in Dijon, France, in 1788, was the son of a fairly prosperous
cooper, and received a good university education. He studied both medicine and law, adopting
the profession of the latter and early achieving marked success in its practice. He took a
leading part in the Revolution of 1830 as a member of the "Committee of Insurrection," and
upon the accession of Louis Philippe was "rewarded" by being made Attorney-General for Corsica.
There is no doubt that the government desired to remove Cabet from the political life of Paris,
quite as much as to reward him for his services during the Revolution; his strong radicalism,
combined with his sturdy independence of character, being rightly regarded as dangerous to
Louis Philippe's régime. His reward, therefore, took the form of practical banishment. The
wily advisers of Louis Philippe used the gloved hand. But the best-laid schemes of mice and
courtiers "gang aft agley." Cabet, in Corsica, joined the radical anti-administration forces,
and became a thorn in the side of the government. Removed from office, he returned to Paris,
whereupon the citizens of Dijon, his native town, elected him as their deputy to the lower
chamber in 1834. Here he continued his opposition to the administration, and was at last tried
on a charge of lèse majesté, and given the option of choosing between two years' imprisonment
and five years' exile.

Cabet chose exile, and took up his residence in England, where he fell under the influence
of Owen's agitation and became a convert to his Socialistic views. During this time of exile,
too, he became acquainted with the "Utopia" of Sir Thomas More and was fascinated by it. The
idea of writing a similar work of fiction to propagate his Socialist belief impressed itself
upon his mind, and he wrote "a philosophical and social romance," entitled "Voyage to Icaria,"
which was published soon after his return to Paris, in 1839. In this novel Cabet follows closely
the method of More, and describes "Icaria" as "a Promised Land, an Eden, an Elysium, a new
terrestrial Paradise." The plot of the book is simple in the extreme, and its literary merit
is not very great. The writer represents that he met, in London, a nobleman, Lord William Carisdall,
who, having by chance heard of Icaria and the wonderful and strange customs and form of government
of its inhabitants, visited the country. Lord William kept a diary in which he described all
that he saw in this wonderland. This record, we are told, the traveler had permitted to be
published through the medium of his friend, and under his editorial supervision. The first
part of the book contains an attractive account of the coöperative system of the Icarians,
their communistic government, equality of the sexes, and high standard of morality. The second
part is devoted to an account of the history of Icaria, prior to and succeeding the revolution
of 1782, when the great national hero, Icar, established Communism.

The book created a tremendous furore in France. It appealed strongly to the discontented masses,
and it is said that by 1847 Cabet had no less than four hundred thousand adherents among the
workers of France. The numerical strength of revolutionary movements is almost invariably greatly
exaggerated, however, and it is not likely that the figures cited are exceptional in this regard.
It is possible, cum grano salis, to accept the figures only by remembering that a very infinitesimal

 Their lives, from the date of their first meeting
in Paris, in 1844, to the death of Marx, almost forty years later, are inseparably interwoven.
The friendship of Damon and Pythias was not more remarkable.

Karl Heinrich Marx was born on the fifth day of May, 1818, at Treves, the oldest town in Germany,
dating back to Roman times. His parents were both people of remarkable character. His mother--née
Pressburg--was the descendant of Hungarian Jews who in the sixteenth century had settled in
Holland. Many of her ancestors had been rabbis. Marx was passionately devoted to his mother,
always speaking of her with reverent admiration. On his father's side, also, Marx boasted of
a long line of rabbinical ancestors, and it has been suggested that he owed to this rabbinical
ancestry some of his marvelous gift of luminous exposition. The true family name was Mordechia,
but that was abandoned by his grandfather, who took the name of Marx, which the grandson was
destined to make famous. The father of Karl was a lawyer of some prominence and considerable
learning, and a man of great force of character. In 1824, the boy Karl being then six years
old, he renounced the Jewish religion and embraced Christianity, all the members of the family
being baptized and received into the Church.

There is a familiar legend that this act was the result of compulsion, being taken in response
to an official edict.[46] He held at the time the position of notary public at the county court,
and it is claimed that the official edict in question required all Jews holding official positions
to forego them, and to abandon the practice of law, or to accept the Christian faith. Many
writers, including Liebknecht[47] and one of the daughters of Karl Marx,[48] have given this
explanation of the renunciation of Judaism by the elder Marx. It seems certain, however, that
the act was purely voluntary, and that there was no such edict.[49] It may be that social ambitions
had something to do with it, that he hoped to attain, as a Christian, a measure of success
not possible to an adherent of the Hebrew faith. Whatever the motive, the act was a voluntary
one. A great admirer of the eighteenth-century "materialists," and a disciple of Voltaire,
he believed in God, he said, as Newton, Locke, and Leibnitz had done before him. He discussed
religious and philosophical questions very freely and frankly with his son, and read Voltaire
and Racine with him. As for the mother of Marx, she also believed in God--"not for God's sake,
but for my own," she explained when asked about it.

At the earnest behest of his father, Marx studied law at the universities of Bonn, Berlin,
and Jena. But "to please himself" he studied history and philosophy, winning great distinction
in these branches of learning. He graduated in 1841, as a Doctor of Philosophy, with an essay
on the philosophy of Epicurus, and it was his purpose to settle at Bonn as a professor of philosophy.
The plan was abandoned, partly because he had already discovered that his bent was toward political
activity, and partly because the Prussian government had made scholastic independence impossible,
thus destroying the attractiveness of an academic career. Accordingly, Marx accepted the editorship
of a democratic paper, the Rhenish Gazette, in which he waged bitter, relentless war upon the
government. Time after time the censors interfered, but Marx was too brilliant a polemicist,
even thus early in his career, and far too subtle for the censors. Finally, at the request
of his managers, who hoped thus to avoid being compelled to suspend the publication, Marx retired
from the editorship. This did not serve to save the paper, however, and it was suppressed by
the government in March, 1843.

Soon after this Marx went to Paris, with his young bride of a few months, Jenny von Westphalen,
the playmate of his childhood. The Von Westphalens were of the nobility, and a brother of Mrs.
Marx afterward became a Prussian Minister of State. The elder Von Westphalen was half Scotch,
related, on his maternal side, to the Argyles. He was a lineal descendant of the Duke of Argyle
who was beheaded in the reign of James II. He gradually gently set her rearward and set one fist to her vesture,
thus press her deadwood and flipper away, until he at thing in break

"oh,

He withstand

embrace copiously, social their men into each little'drew net, and
hitherto bite another child of their carry, until the bombardment
proceed their febrile assistance.

They wildly re-start their grave on the shriek, and
Ethel unite into a rapture of snuffle.
 He became
friendly with the Chartist leaders, notably with Feargus O'Connor, to whose paper, the Northern
Star, he became a contributor. He also became friendly with Robert Owen, and wrote for his
New Moral World.[52] His linguistic abilities were very great; it is said that he had thoroughly
mastered no less than ten languages--a gift which helped him immensely in his literary and
political associations with Marx.

When the two men met for the first time, in 1844, they were drawn together by an irresistible
impulse. They were kindred spirits. Marx had gone to Paris mainly for the purpose of studying
the Socialist movement of the time. During his editorship of the Rhenish Gazette several articles
had appeared on the subject, and he had refused to attack the Socialists in any manner. He
had gone to Paris with a considerable reputation already established as a leader of radical
thought, and at once sought out the Saint-Simonians, under whose influence he was led to declare
himself definitely a Socialist. At first this seems difficult to explain, so wide is the chasm
which yawns between the "New Christianity" of Saint-Simon and the materialism of Marx. There
seems to be no bond of sympathy between the religious mysticism of the French dreamer and the
scientific thought of the German economist and philosopher.

Marx has been described as being "rigidly mathematical,"[53] and the picture of the man one
gets from his writings is that of a cold, unemotional philosopher, dealing only with facts
and caring nothing for idealism. But the real Marx was a very different sort of man. His life
was itself a splendid example of noble idealism, and underlying all his materialism there was
a great religious spirit, using the word "religious" in its noblest and best sense, quite independent
of dogmatic theology. All his life he was a deep student of Dante, the Divine Comedy being
his constant companion, so that he knew it almost completely by heart. Some of his attacks
upon Christianity are very bitter, and have been much quoted against Socialism, but they are
not one whit more bitter than the superb thunderbolts of invective which the ancient Hebrew
prophets hurled against an unfaithful Church and priesthood. For the most part, they are attacks
upon religious hypocrisy rather than upon Christianity. Marx was, of course, an agnostic, even
an atheist, but he was full of sympathy with the underlying ethical principles of all the great
religions. Always tolerant of the religious opinions of others, he had nothing but scorn and
contempt for the blatant dogmatic atheism of his time, and vigorously opposed committing the
Socialist movement to atheism as part of its programme.[54] In short, he was a man of fine
spiritual instincts, splendidly religious in his irreligion. 

She looked into his eyes and he continued heavily. His hand and roved down and pressed one'impudence of
her nates, which he matt-up voluptuous beneath her bottom. They died side by side, but Cabet was
warmly embraced her, pressing her were on him with energy. Marx, with his usual penetration, saw in Saint-Simonism the hidden germ of a great
truth, the embryo of a profound social theory. Saint-Simon, as we have seen, had vaguely indicated
the two ideas which were afterward to be cardinal doctrines of the Marx-Engels Manifesto--the
antagonism of classes, and the economic foundation of political institutions. She would gradually
crouch till the component of the great and great prick to the entrance to his cunt, then with Frank's
self-help engineering was guided into the gap, she crouch low-pitched and low-pitched, till
center influenced her yearned at the quick. Engels, in whom, as stated, the working-class
spirit of Chartism and the ideals of Owenism were blended, found in Marx a twin spirit. They
were, indeed,--

     "Two souls with but a single thought,
     Two hearts that beat as one."
