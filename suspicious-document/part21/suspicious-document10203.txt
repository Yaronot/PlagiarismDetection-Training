PRINTING did not make the Renaissance; the Renaissance made printing. Printing did not begin
the publication and dissemination of books. There were libraries of vast extent in ancient
Babylon, Egypt, Greece, Rome. There were universities centuries before Gutenberg where the
few instructed the many in the learning treasured up in books, and where both scholars and
professional scribes multiplied copies of books both old and new. At the outset of any examination
of the influence of printing on the Renaissance it is necessary to remind ourselves that the
intellectual life of the ancient and the mediaeval world was built upon the written word. There
is a naive view in which ancient literature is conceived as existing chiefly in the autograph
manuscripts and original documents of a few great centers to which all ambitious students must
have resort. A very little inquiry into the multiplication of books before printing shows us
how erroneous is this view.

We must pass over entirely the history of publishing and book-selling in ancient times, a subject
too vast for adequate summary in a preliminary survey of this sort. Chisco had not returned, nor had a living soul passed that would give notice of him or
of the others. And to all that, I was missing my uncle and Facia and ToÃ±a and I appeared black
to hide the truth of what would happen, and the snow was thickening, and the mist of the night was progressing...
Eternal God, what infatuation of mine! When the gates of the house would close and Chisco would not be
inside it, and that unhappy man would know, and we had to show him
the truth... It would be as if I were to stab him!

And the night was over, finally, to wrap the house and the valley and the mountains in the
most dense and impenetrable obscurity; the gates had been closed. The fire in the kitchen was
brought alive, my uncle was brought to the fire in his usual seat, but he was alarmed and uneasy, because
he would see us all alarmed and uneasy wondering like shadows more than being like people around
him... and nothing, not even a voice outside, not a bang, nor a whistle!The silence, the solitude,
the cold of the graves, death everywhere! I had never before found God's majesty so great, nor
had I ever prayed with more fervor than then, while I wandered from door to door watching and
hearing, without seeing or listening more than the impenetrable darkness of the night, the lingering
roar of the Nansa, that more than noise was like a breath of silence
and the unrewarded heart beats of my heart.

That's how one hour passed that had seemed like a century. I was heading then to prepare my uncle
(who at times languished without daring to ask us a word) for the terrible news with a speech
that had been badly sown, when God had wanted us to hear to loud bangs on the gates that faced
the street. That was, at the least a lull and frighting agony that we all suffered within those blackened
walls. But if that who called was not Chisco, or who would bring us news of him and of the other
absentees, were we not to kill him, whoever it may be?

I, myself, too the lantern that had been lit long before for a luxury of precautions taken at the
lack of something better and more calm to occupy my time. And I went down the stairs three steps
at a time; I arrived at the gates at the same time that the bans would repeat themselves,
and with a limp and accelerated hand I freed the lock that would secure the gate from inside, I unlocked
and opened. Two bulks awaited outside. I lifted the lantern to recognize them before letting them in,
and I knew, God almighty, Neluco and Chisco! Canelo was there as well, curled up. They came in,
I took a hold of them and embraced them almost crying with happiness. But in what condition they were!
Chisco, sickly, discouraged, and with the head bandaged and an arm on a sling. Neluco was dismissing and
pale; and both were covered in water from head to toes, stiff and
purple from the cold... The uneasiness and the exalts invaded me once
again and I asked them with a horrible fright to what the answers
would be: "And Don Sabas?"

"Well," Neluco answered me with a foggy voice.

"And Pito Salces?" "Him as well."

"And Pepazos?" -For Christ's sake!, the doctor interrupted pushing
me to the deep of the place-

 Another name for the university book-dealers was the classical
Latin word =librarii=, which usually in mediaeval Latin meant not what we call a librarian
but a vender of books, like the French =libraire=. These scribes were not allowed at first
to sell their manuscripts, but rented them to the students at rates fixed by university statutes.
A folded sheet of eight pages, sixteen columns of sixty-two lines each, was the unit on which
the rental charges were based. Such a sheet at the beginning of the thirteenth century rented
for about twenty cents a term; and since an ordinary textbook of philosophy or theology or
canon law contained many sheets, these charges constituted no inconsiderable part of the cost
of instruction. The books must be returned before the student left the university; sales were
at first surreptitious and illegal, but became common early in the fourteenth century. Reasonable
accuracy among the stationers was secured by a system of fines for errors, half of which went
to the university, the other half being divided between the supervisor or head proof-reader
and the informant who discovered the error.

The original regulation which forbade the stationers to sell books was intended to prevent
students of a profiteering turn of mind from buying books for resale to their fellow-students
at a higher price, thus cornering the market and holding up the work of an entire class. In
course of time, however, the book-dealers were permitted not only to sell textbooks, at prices
still controlled by official action, but also to buy and sell manuscripts of other books, both
those produced by local scribes and those imported from other cities and countries.

This broadening of the activities of the university bookstores led naturally to the third and
last stage which the publishing business underwent before the invention of printing. This stage
was the establishment in Florence, Paris, and other intellectual centers, of bookshops selling
manuscripts to the general public rather than to university students. These grew rapidly during
the first half of the fifteenth century, receiving a marked impetus from the new interest in
Greek studies. Some years before the fall of Constantinople in 1453 Italian book-sellers were
accustomed to send their buyers to the centers of Byzantine learning in the near East in quest
of manuscripts to be disposed of at fancy prices to the rich collectors and patrons of literature.
There is evidence of similar methods in France and Germany during the earlier decades of the
Renaissance.

This preliminary sketch of the book-publishing business before printing is intended to correct
a rather common misapprehension. Manuscript books were indeed relatively costly, but they were
not scarce. Any scholar who had not been through a university not only had access to public
libraries of hundreds of volumes, but might also possess, at prices not beyond the reach of
a moderate purse, his own five-foot shelf of the classics. The more elegant manuscripts, written
by experts and adorned with rich illuminations and sumptuous bindings, were of course not for
the humble student; but working copies, multiplied on a large scale by a roomful of scribes
writing simultaneously from dictation, might always be had.

We are not sure that he had the whole twenty books; that was his ambition, his academic dream
of wealth; but we are assured that he spent on books all the money he could borrow from his
friends, and that he showed his gratitude by busily praying for the souls of his creditors.

When we consider the enormous number of manuscript books that must have existed in Europe in
the middle ages, we may well wonder why they have become relatively rare in modern times. Several
explanations account for this. In the first place, the practice of erasing old manuscripts
and using the same vellum again for other works was extremely common. Secondly, vast numbers
of manuscripts in the monasteries and other libraries of Europe were wantonly or accidentally
destroyed by fire, especially in times of war and religious fanaticism. In the third place,
the early binders, down through the sixteenth century and even later, used sheets of vellum
from old manuscripts for the linings and the covers of printed books. Finally, after the invention
of printing, as soon as a given work had been adequately and handsomely printed in a standard
edition, all but the finest manuscripts of that book would naturally be looked upon as of little
value, and would be subject to loss and decay if not to deliberate destruction. Owing to these
and perhaps other causes it is almost entirely the religious manuscripts that have survived,
except those preserved in royal libraries and museums from the finer collections of the middle
ages.

The invention of printing was not the work of any one man. Not only were printed pages of text
with accompanying pictures produced from woodcut blocks in Holland a quarter of a century before
Gutenberg began his work at Mainz, but it is pretty well established that movable types were
employed by Laurence Koster, of Haarlem, as early as 1430. But Koster, who died about 1440,
did not carry his invention beyond the experimental stages, and produced no really fine printing. 

By air the two cubs were still hanging Pito thrown from the mouth of the den, Canelo when an arrow
shot out and beating to the large cave entrance. I was very close to it, I looked at Chisco and
read in his eyes something like confirmation a suspicion that he had had. See this and helps
allay the light of the cave as if Run a curtain in front of his mouth, on the side of the garrigue,
was all one.

- The machu! - Chisco said then. He seems to have
worked in secret for some years on the problems involved in type-founding and printing before
the year 1450, when he set up his shop in Mainz.

The capital for the new business was furnished by a wealthy goldsmith named Johann Fust. Between
1450 and 1455 Gutenberg printed an edition of the Latin Bible, sometimes known as the Mazarin
Bible, which is ordinarily regarded as the first printed book. It was a magnificently printed
volume, exhibiting at the very foundation of the art a skill in presswork scarcely surpassed
by any of Gutenberg's immediate successors. He was a great printer, but not a financially successful
one. 

Every neighbor is obligated to provide a vegetable garden and also, to anually plant a number of fruit
trees and of public utility buildings, which the town has in common, once a year in the appointed
place.
Although Gutenberg started another publishing house at Mainz, and continued it until his death
in 1468, the main development of printing after 1455 was in the original plant as carried on
by Fust and his son-in-law, Peter Schoeffer. They printed in 1457 an edition of the Psalms
in which for the first time two-color printing was employed, the large initial letters being
printed in red and black. This innovation, designed to imitate the rubricated initials of the
manuscripts, involved great technical difficulties in the presswork, and was not generally
adopted. Most of the early printed books, even down to the end of the fifteenth century, left
blanks for the large capitals at the beginnings of the chapters, to be filled in by hand by
professional illuminators. 

Read! Write! The poor man did not know that when a man gives hours of tedious lectures, that it
distracts one from being able to be attentive, because it gives one all the necessary time to be bored,
as mandated by the mischievous law of the human condition. Before 1470 there were printing establishments in
almost every German city, and hundreds of works, mostly theological, had been issued from their
presses.

In all these early German books, printed of course in Latin, the type used was the black-letter.
Gutenberg, in designing his first font, evidently tried to imitate as closely as possible the
angular gothic alphabet employed by the scribes in the best manuscripts. Needed now leaving
the way clear of Planchon, and perhaps our generation is restricted to the glory to perform this:
then assess the full import of this thought, that Colonel Garcia has the merit of having cleared.
 Thus a stroke over a vowel indicated an
omitted =m= or =n=, a =p= with a stroke across it indicated the Latin prefix =per=, a circle
above the line stood for the termination =us=, an =r= with a cross meant--=rum=, and so forth.
These abbreviations, which make printed books of the earliest period rather hard reading today,
were retained not only to save space but to give the printed page as nearly as possible the
appearance of a fine manuscript. It was not at first the ambition of the printers and type-founders
to make their books more legible or less taxing on the eyes than manuscript; their readers
were accustomed to manuscript and felt no need of such improvements. The mechanical advance
in the art of writing brought about by printing was at first regarded as consisting in the
greater rapidity and lower cost at which printed books could be produced. Could remaining
in the entire range worldwide and sublunary more bears than it ever lay at our feet, between
young and old, living and dead? Then we look at the three hunters, as if we had tacitly agreed
that it was impossible to commit more atrocities that we had just committed, and that only by a miracle
of God had been live to count. This scene moves, which was brief, ended by casting Pito hat
air, ie, crashing against the roof bristling with tips calcareous made Chisco the same, and
I would not be less than two. Then we shook hands, and I swear to God by shaking of Chisco in
mine, my heart beat pulse heartfelt thanks. What would become of me without his calm and courageous
push?

Canelo, to all this, if not licked the scratches, shallow, skin that bordered in many places,
gasping and groaning, with his nose resting on their arms together and laid forward, but with eyes
fixed on the cubs rebullían between the asperities soil and pools of blood as very fat worms.
They did not, by the trace over one week of age. Chisco she picked one to one by the scruff
of cerviguillo, and was Canyon throwing over the ledge from the bottom of the cave. Would
do same with the Perruca, after assuring that Pito "aqueyu" was not sewing or remedy possible
because it had been "empty aentru" as the light was, but Pete wanted to better fate as the cubs to
the corpse of poor little animal, so wickedly sacrificed and suggested that we bury in the
mountains, and it readily assented Chisco and me.
 1480 he printed many fine books,
and in most of them he employed what is now called roman type. He was not absolutely the first
to use the roman alphabet, but his roman fonts were designed and cast with such artistic taste,
such a fine sense of proportion and symmetry of form, that the Jenson roman became the model
of later printers for many years after his death. Roman type, unlike the black-letter, had
two distinct origins. The capitals were derived from the letters used by the ancient Roman
architects for inscriptions on public buildings. The small letters were adapted from the rounded
vertical style of writing used in many Italian texts, altogether different in form from the
angular gothic alphabet used in ecclesiastical manuscripts. Jenson's roman letters were clear,
sharp and easy to read, and constituted the greatest single addition to the art of printing
since its beginning. Germany clung obstinately to the black-letter in its Latin books, as it
has adhered down to very recent times to a similar heavy type for the printing of German text;
but the rest of Europe within a few years came over to the clearer and more beautiful roman.

There were many early printers at Venice between Jenson and his greater successor Aldus Manutius,
who began business in 1494, but we shall pass over them all in order to devote more careful
attention to the noble history of the Aldine press. I propose in the remainder of this paper
to select five great printers of the Renaissance, and to examine their work both as a whole
and as illustrated in typical examples. These five are:

          ALDUS MANUTIUS, of Venice.

          ROBERT ESTIENNE, of Paris, commonly known by the name of
                =Stephanus=.

          JOHANN FROBEN, of Basel.

          ANTON KOBERGER, of Nuremberg.

          WILLIAM CAXTON, of London.

Each stands for a different aspect of the art of printing, both in the mechanical features
of book-making and also in the selection of works to be published and the editorial methods
employed in making them ready for the press. Taken together, the books issued from their presses
at the end of the fifteenth and the beginning of the sixteenth century form a sort of composite
picture of the Renaissance.
