Which ensamples how cōfortable are they for vs/ whē we be fallen in to sinne & God is come
vppō vs with a scorge/ [that] we dispeare not/ but repēt with full hope of mercie after [the]
ensamples of mercie [that] are gone before: And therfore they were written for our lernīge/
as testifieth Paul Ro. xv. to cōforte vs/ [that] we might [the] better put oure hope & trust
in God/ whē we se/ how mercifull he hath bene in tymes past vn to our weake brethern [that]
are gone before/ in all theyr aduersities/ neade/ temptaciōs/ ye & horrible synnes in to which
they now & then fell.

¶ And on [the] other side ye se how they [that] hardened their hertes & synned of malice &
refused mercie [that] was offered thē & had no power to repēt/ perished at [the] later ende
with all confusion & shame mercilessely. Which ensamples are very good & necessary/ to kepe
vs in awe & dreade in tyme of prosperite as thou maist se by Paul. j. Cor. x. that we abyde
in the feare of God/ & wax not wild and fall to vanities ād so synne ād prouoke God and bringe
wrath vppon vs.

¶ And thridly ye se in that practise/ how as god is mercifull & longesoferynge/ euen so were
all his true prophetes & prechers/ beringe the infirmities of their weake brethern & their
awne wrōges & iniuries with all paciēce & longesoferinge/ neuer castinge any of thē of their
backes/ vn tyll they synned agenst [the] holygost/ maliciously persecutinge [the] open & manifest
trouth: cōtrary vn to the ensample of [the] Pope/ which in sinninge agenst God & to quench
[the] trueth of his holy spirite/ is euer chefe captayne and trōpetblower/ to sett other awerke/
ād seketh only his awne fredome/ liberte/ priuilege/ welth/ prosperite/ profite/ pleasure/
pastyme/ honoure & glorie/ with [the] bondage/ thraldome/ captiuite/ miserie/ wretchednesse
& vile subiectiō of his brethern: & in his awne cause is so feruent/ so steffe & cruell/ that
he will not sofre one word spoken agenst his false magiste/ wily inuenciōs ād iuglynge ypocrisie
to be vnaduēged/ thongh all christendome shuld be sett to gether by the eares/ and shuld cost
he cared not how many hundred thousande their lives.

       *       *       *       *       *

Now [that] thou mayst reade Ionas frutefully & not as a poetis fable/ but as an obligacō betwene
God and thy soule/ as an ernist peny geuen [the] of God/ [that] he wil helpe [the] in time
of nede/ if thou turne to him ād as the word of god [the] only fode ād life of thy soule/ this
marke & note. First count Ionas the frend of god ād a man chosen of god to testifie his name
vn to [the] worlde: but yet a younge scolar/ weake & rude/ after [the] faciō of [the] appostles/
while Christ was yet with them bodyly. Which though Christ taught thē euer to be meke & to
vmble thē selues/ yet oft stroue amonge them selues who shuld be greatest. The sonnes of Zebede
wold sitt/ the one on the right hōde of Christ ād the other on [the] lifte. They wold praye/
that fire might descēde from heuen/ and consume the Samaritanes.

¶ Whē Christ axed who saye men that I am/ Peter answered/ thou arte the sonne of the lyuinge
God/ as though Peter had bene as perfecte as an angell. But immediatly after/ when Christ preached
vn to thē of his deeth & passiō/ Peter was angre & rebuked Christe & thought ernestly [that]
he had raued & not wist what he sayde: as at a nother time/ when Christ was so feruētly busied
in healinge [the] people/ [that] he had not leyser to eate/ they went out to holde him/ supposinge
that he had bene besyde him selfe. Ande one [that] cast out deuels in Christes name/ they forbade/
because he wayted not on them/ so glorious were they yet.

¶ And though christ taughte all waye to forgeue/ yet peter after longe goenge to scole/ axed
wether men shuld forgeue .vij. tymes/ thynkinge [that] .viij. tymes had bene to moch. And at
[the] last soper Peter wold have died with christe/ but yet within fewe howres after/ he denied
hym/ both cowardly & shamefully. And after [the] same maner/ though he had so lōge herd that
nomā might auenge him selfe/ but rather turne [the] other cheke to/ then to smyte agayne/ yet
when Christ was in takīge/ peter axed whether it were lawfull to smyte with [the] swerde/ ād
taried none answere/ but layed on rashly. So that though when we come first vn to [the] knowlege
of the trueth/ and the peace is made betwene God & vs/ & we loue his lawes & beleue & trust
in hym/ as in oure father & haue good hertes vn to him & be born anew in [the] sprite: yet
we are but childern ād younge scolars weake & foble & must have leysar to grow in [the] spirite/
in knowlege/ loue & in [the] dedes therof/ as younge childern must have tyme to grow in their
bodies.

¶ And God oure father & scolemaster fedeth vs & teached vs accordinge vn to the capacite of
oure stomakes/ & maketh vs to grow & waxe perfecte/ & fineth vs & trieth vs as gold/ in [the]
fire of temptaciōs & tribulations. As Moses wittneseth Deutero. viij. sayēge: Remēber all [the]
waye by which [the] lord thy God caried [the] this .xl. yeres in [the] wildernesse/ to vmble
the & to tēpte or proue the/ [that] it might be knowen what were in thine hert. He brougt the
in to aduersite & made [the] an hongred/ & then feed [the] with mā which nether thou ner yet
thi fathers euer knew of/ to teach [the] that a mā liueth not by bred only/ but by all that
proceadeth out of the mouth of God. For [the] promises of god are life vn to all [that] cleaue
vn to thē/ moch moare thē is bred & bodyly sustinaunce: as [the] iourney of [the] childern
of Israel out of egypte in to [the] londe promised them/ ministreth the notable ensamples &
[that] aboundātly/ as doeth all [the] rest of the bible also. How be it/ it is impossible for
flesh to beleue & to trust in [the] trueth of gods promises/ vntyll he haue lerned it in moch
tribulacion/ after that God hath deliuered hī out therof agayne.

¶ God therfore to teach Ionas & to shew him his awne hert & to make him perfecte & to enstructe
vs also bi his ensample/ sent him out of [the] lande of Israel where he was a prophete/ to
goo amonge [the] heathē people & to [the] greatest & mightiest citie of [the] world thē/ called
Niniue: to preache [that] within .xl. dayes they shuld all perish for their sinnes & that [the]
citie shuld be ouerthrowē. Which message [the] frewil of Ionas had as moch power to doo/ as
the weakest herted womā in the world hath power/ if she were cōmaunded/ to leppe in to a tobbe
of lyuinge snakes & edders: as happely if God had cōmaunded Sara to haue sacrificed hir sonne
Isaac/ as he did Abrahā/ she wold haue disputed with hī yer she had done it/ or though she
were strōge ynough/ yet many an holy seint coud not haue found in their hertes/ but wold haue
disobeyed ād haue runne awaye frō [the] presens of [the] cōmaūdemēt of god [with] Ionas if
thei had bene so strōgly tēpted.

¶ For Ionas thought of this maner: loo/ I am here a prophete vn to Gods people the Israelites.
Which though they haue gods word testified vn to them dayly/ yet dispice it & worshepe God
vnder [the] likenesse of calues & after all maner facions saue after his awne worde/ & therfore
are of all naciōs [the] worst & most worthy of punishment. And yet god for loue of few [that]
are amonge them & for his names sake spareth them & defendeth them. How thē shuld god take
so cruell vengeaunce on so greate a multitude of them to whome his name was neuer preached
to ād therfore are not [the] tenth parte so euel as these? If I shal therfore goo preach so
shall I lye & shame my selfe & God therto and make them the moare to dispice god and sett the
lesse by him ād to be the moare cruell vn to his people.

¶ And vppon that imaginaciō he fled frō the face or presens of God: that is/ out of [the] contre
where God was worsheped in & frō prosecutynge of Gods cōmaundemēt/ and thought/ I wyll gett
me a nother waye amonge [the] hethen people & be no moare a prophete/ but lyue at rest & out
of all cōbraunce. Neuer [the] lesse the god of all mercie which careth for his electe childern
& turneth all vn to good to them & smiteth thē to heale them agayne & killeth thē to make thē
aliue agayne/ & playeth with thē (as a father doth some tyme with his yoūge ignoraunt childern)
& tempteth them & proueth them to make them se theyr awne hertes/ prouided for Ionas/ how all
thinge shuld be.

¶ When Ionas was entered in to the sheppe/ he layed him downe to slepe ād to take his rest:
that is/ his cōscience was tossed betwene the cōmaudemēt of God which sent him to Niniue/ &
his fleshly wisdome that dissuaded & counseled hym [the] cōtrary & at [the] last preualed agēst
[the] cōmaundemēt & caried hym a nother waye/ as a sheppe caught betwene .ii. streames/ & as
poetes faine the mother of Meliager to be betwene diuers affectiōs/ while to aduēge hir brothers
deeth/ she sought to sle hir awne sonne. Where vppon for very payne & tediousnesse/ he laye
downe to slepe/ for to put [the] cōmaundement which so gnew & freate his cōscience/ out of
minde/ as [the] nature of all weked is/ whē they haue sinned a good/ to seke al meanes with
riot/ reuell & pastyme/ to driue [the] remenbraunce of synne out of their thoughtes or as Adā
did/ to couer their nakednesse with aporns of pope holy workes. But God awoke hym out of his
dreame/ and sett his synnes before his face.

¶ For when [the] Lott had caught Ionas/ thē be sure [that] his synnes came to remēbraunce agayne
& that his conscience raged no lesse thē [the] waues of the se. And thē he thought that he
only was a sinner & [the] hethen that ware in [the] shepp none in respecte of him/ ad thought
also/ as veryly as he was fled frō god/ that as verily god had cast hī awaye: for [the] sight
of [the] rod maketh [the] natural child not ōly to se & to knowlege his faulte/ but also to
forgett all his fathers olde mercie & kindnesse. And then he cōfessed his synne openly & had
yet leuer perish alone thē [that] [the] other shuld haue perished with him for his sake: and
so of very desperacion to haue liued any lenger/ bad cast him in to [the] see betymes/ excepte
they wold be lost also.

¶ To speake of lottes/ how ferforth they are lawfull/ is a light questiō. First to vse thē
for the breakinge of strife/ as when partenars/ their goodes as equally diuided as they cā/
take euery mā his parte by lott/ to auoyde all suspiciō of disceytfulnesse: & as [the] appostles
in [the] first of [the] Actes/ whē they sought a nother to succede Iudas the traytoure/ & .ii.
persones were presentes/ thē to breake strife & to satisfie al parties/ did cast lotttes/ wheter
shuld be admitted/ desirynge god to teper thē & to take whō he knew most mete/ seynge they
wist not wheter to preferre/ or haply coude not all agre on ether/ is lawfull ad in all like
cases. But to abuse them vn to [the] temptinge of God & to cōpell him therwith to vtter thinges
wherof we stōd in doute/ when we haue no commaundemēt of him so to do/ as these hethē here
dyd/ though God turned it vn to his glorie/ can not be but euell.

¶ The hethen scepmē asstonied at [the] sight of [the] miracle/ feared God/ prayed to him/ offered
sacrifice & vowed vowes. And I doute not/ but that some of thē or haply all came therby vn
to the true knowlege & true worshepinge of God & ware wōne to God in theyr soules. And [thus]
God which is infinite mercifull in all his wayes/ wrought their soules health out of [the]
infirmite of Ionas/ euen of his good will & purpose & loue wherewith he loued them before the
world was made/ & not of chaunce/ as it appereth vn to the eyes of the ignoraunt.

¶ And that Ionas was .iii. dayes & .iii. nightes in the bely of his fish: we cā not therby
proue vn to te Iewes & īfideles or vn to any man/ [that] Christ must therfore dye ād be buried
& rise agayne. But we vse [the] ensample ād likenesse to strength the faith of the weake. For
he that beleaueth the one can not doute in [the] other: in as moch as the hād of God was no
lesse mightie in preseruīge Ionas aliue agenst all naturall possibilite & in deliuerynge hī
safe out of his fish/ thē in reysynge vpp Christe agayne out of his sepulchre. And we maye
describe [the] power & vertue of [the] resurrecciō therby/ as Christ hī selfe boroweth [the]
similitude therto Mat. xij. sayēge vn to [the] Iewes that came aboute him & desyred a signe
or a wōder frō heuen to certifye thē that he was christ: this euell & wedlockebreakīge naciō
(which breake [the] wedlocke of faith wherwith they be maried vn to God/ ād beleue in their
false workes) seke a signe/ but there shal no signe be geuen thē saue [the] signe of the Prophete
Ionas. For as Ionas was .iij. dayes ād iij. nightes in the bely of the whale/ euē so shall
the sonne of man be .iij. dayes & .iij. nyghtes in the herte of the erth. Which was a watch
word/ as we saye/ & a sharpe threateninge vn to [the] Iewes & as moch to saye as thus/ ye harde
herted Iewes seke a signe: loo/ thys shalbe youre sygne/ as Ionas was reysed out of the sepulchre
of his fishe & then sent vn to the Niniuites to preach [that] they shuld perish/ euen so shall
I ryse agayne out of my sepulchre & come & preach repentaunce vn to you. Se therfore when ye
se [the] signe that ye repēt or else ye shal suerly perish & not escape. For though the infirmities
which ye now se ī my flesh be a lett vn to youre faythes/ ye shall yet then be with out excuse/
when ye se so greate a miracle & so greate power of god shed out vppō you. And so Christe came
agayne after [the] resurrecciō/ in his spirite & preached repētaunce vn to them/ by the mouth
of his appostles & disciples/ & with miracles of [the] holy gost. And all that repented not
perished shortly after ād were for [the] most parte slayne with swerde ād [the] rest caried
awaye captiue in to all quarters of the world for an ensample/ as ye se vn to this daye.

¶ And in lyke maner sens the world beganne/ where soeuer repentaunce was offered and not receaued/
there God toke cruell vengeaunce immediatly: as ye se in [the] floud of Noe/ in the ouerthrowēge
of Sodō & Gomor & all the contre aboute: & as ye se of Egipte/ of the Amorites/ Cananites &
afterwarde of the very Israelites/ & then at the last of the Iewes to/ ād of the Assyriens
and Babyloniens and so thorout all the imperes of the world.

¶ Gyldas preached repētaunce vn to [the] olde Britaynes that inhabited englōd: they repented
not/ & therfore God sent in theyr enimies vppō thē on euery side & destroyed thē vpp & gaue
the lōd vn to other naciōs. And greate vengeaunce hath bene takē in that lande for synne sens
that tyme.

¶ Wicleffe preached repētaunce vn to oure fathers not longe sens: they repēted not for their
hertes were indurat & theyr eyes blinded with their awne Pope holy rightwesnesse wherwith they
had made theyr soules gaye agenst the receauinge agayne of [the] weked spirite that bringeth
.vii. worse then hym selfe with him & maketh [the] later ende worse then the beginninge: for
in open sinnes there is hope of repentaunce/ but in holy ypocrisie none at all. But what folowed?
they slew their true & right kinge ād sett vpp .iii. wrōge kīges arow/ vnder which all the
noble bloud was slayne vpp ād halfe the comēs therto/ what in fraunce & what with their awne
swerde/ in fightīge amonge thē selues for [the] crowne/ & [the] cities and townes decayed and
the land brought halfe in to a wyldernesse in respecte of that it was before.

¶ And now Christ to preach repētaunce/ is resen yet ōce agayne out of his sepulchre in which
the pope had buried him and kepte him downe with his pilars and polaxes and all disgysinges
of ypocrisie/ with gyle/ wiles and falshed/ ād with the swerd of al princes which he had blynded
with his false marchaundice. And as I dowte not of [the] ensamples that are past/ so am I sure
that greate wrath will folow/ excepte repētaunce turne it backe agayne and cease it.

¶ When Ionas had bene in te fishes bely a space & the rage of his conscience was somewhat quieted
ād swaged and he come to him selfe agayne and had receaued a lytle hope/ the qualmes & panges
of desperaciō which went ouer hys hert/ halfe ouercome/ he prayed/ as he maketh menciō in the
texte sayēge: Ionas prayed vn to the lord his god out of the bely of the fishe. But the wordes
of that prayer are not here sett. The prayer [that] here stondeth in the texte/ is the prayer
of prayse & thākesgeuēge which he prayed and wrote when he was escaped and past all ieopardie.

¶ In the end of which prayer he sayth/ I will sacrifice with the voyce of thankesgeuenge and
paye that I haue vowed/ that sauinge cometh of the lorde. For verely to cōfesse out of the
herte/ that all benefites come of God/ euen out of the goodnesse of his mercie and not deseruinge
of oure dedes/ is the only sacrifice that pleaseth God. And to beleue that god only is the
sauer/ is the thynge that all the Iewes vowed in theyr circumcision/ as we in oure baptim.
Which vowe Ionas now tawght with experiēce/ promiseth to paye. For those outwarde sacrifices
of bestes/ vn to which Ionas had haply asscribed to moch before/ were but feble & childish
thinges & not ordeyned/ that the workes of thē selues shuld be a seruice vn to god/ but vn
to the people/ to put thē in remembraunce of this inwarde sacrifice of thankes & of faith to
trust and beleue in God the only sauer. Which significacion when was awaye/ they were abhominable
and deuellysh ydolatrye and imageseruice: as oure ceremonies and sacramentes are become now
to all that trust & beleue in the werke of them and ar not taught the significacions/ to edifye
theyr soules with knowlege and the doctrine of God.

¶ When Ionas was cast vppō lond agayne/ then his will was fre ād had power to goo whother God
sent him & to doo what God bade/ his awne imaginacions layed a parte. For he had bene at a
new scole/ ye ād in a fornace where he was purged of moch refuse & droshe of fleshly wisdome/
which resisted [the] wisdome of god & led Ionases wil cōtrary vn to [the] will of god. For
as ferre as we be blynd in Adam/ we can not but seke & will oure awne profitt/ pleasure & glorie.
And as ferre as we be taughte in the sprite/ we can not but seke & wyll the pleasure and glorie
of God only.

¶ And as for the .iij. dayes iourney of Niniue/ whether it were in length or to goo rounde
aboute it or thorow all the stretes/ I cōmitte vn to the discreciō of other men. But I thinke
that it was then the greatest citie of the world.

¶ And that Ionas wēt a dayes iourney in the citie/ I suppose he did it not in one daye: but
wēt fayre & easyly preachīge here a sermon & there a nother & rebuked the synne of the people
for which they must perishe.
