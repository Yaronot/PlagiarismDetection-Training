These people call themselves the respectable part of the nation. They are, as they pretend,
the virtuous part of the people, because they are quiet; as if virtue consisted in immobility!
There is a canting Scotchman in London, who publishes a paper called the 'Champion' who is
everlastingly harping upon the virtues of the 'fireside,' and who inculcates the duty of quiet
submission. Might we ask this Champion of the teapot and milk-jug whether Magna Charta and
the Bill of Rights were won by the fireside? Whether the tyrants of the House of Stuart and
of Bourbon were hurled down by fireside virtues? Whether the Americans gained their independence,
and have preserved their freedom, by sitting by the fireside? O, no! these were all achieved
by action, and amidst bustle and noise. Quiet indeed! Why in this quality a log, or a stone,
far surpasses even the pupils of this Champion of quietness; and the chairs round his fireside
exceed those who sit in them. But in order to put these quiet, fireside, respectable people
to the test, let us ask them if they approve of drunkenness, breaches of the peace, black eyes,
bloody noses, fraud, bribery, corruption, perjury, and subornation of perjury; and if they
say no, let us ask them whether these are not going on all over the country at every general
election. If they answer yes, as they must unless they be guilty of wilful falsehood, will
they then be so good as to tell us how they reconcile their inactivity with sentiments of virtue?
Some men, in all former ages, have been held in esteem for their wisdom, their genius, their
skill, their valour, their devotion to country, etc., but never until this age, was quietness
deemed a quality to be extolled. It would be no difficult matter to show that the quiet, fireside
gentry are the most callous and cruel, and, therefore, the most wicked part of the nation.
Amongst them it is that you find all the peculators, all the blood-suckers of various degrees,
all the borough-voters and their offspring, all the selfish and unfeeling wretches, who, rather
than risk the disturbing of their ease for one single month, rather than go a mile to hold
up their hand at a public meeting, would see half the people perish with hunger and cold. The
humanity, which is continually on their lips, is all fiction. They weep over the tale of woe
in a novel; but round their 'decent fireside,' never was compassion felt for a real sufferer,
or indignation at the acts of a powerful tyrant.

The object of the efforts of such writers is clearly enough seen. Keep all quiet! Do not rouse!
Keep still! Keep down! Let those who perish, perish in silence! It will, however, be out of
the power of these quacks, with all their laudanum, to allay the blood which is now boiling
in the veins of the people of this kingdom; who, if they are doomed to perish, are at any rate
resolved not to perish in silence. The writer whom I have mentioned above, says that he, of
course, does not count 'the lower classes, who, under the pressure of need or under the influence
of ignorant prejudice, may blindly and weakly rush upon certain and prompt punishment; but
that the security of every decent fireside, every respectable father's best hopes for his children,
still connect themselves with the Government.' And by Government he clearly means all the mass
as it now stands. There is nobody so callous and so insolent as your sentimental quacks and
their patients. How these 'decent fireside' people would stare, if some morning they were to
come down and find them occupied by uninvited visitors! I hope they never will. I hope that
things will never come to this pass: but if one thing more than any other tends to produce
so sad an effect, it is the cool insolence with which such men as this writer treats the most
numerous and most suffering classes of the people.

Long as this Address already is, I cannot conclude without some observations on the 'Charity
Subscriptions' at the London Tavern. The object of this subscription professes to be to afford
relief to the distressed labourers, etc. About forty thousand pounds have been subscribed,
and there is no probability of its going much further. There is an absurdity on the face of
the scheme; for, as all parishes are compelled by law to afford relief to every person in distress,
it is very clear that, as far as money is given by these people to relieve the poor, there
will be so much saved in the parish rates. But the folly of the thing is not what I wish you
most to attend to. Several of the subscribers to this fund receive each of them more than ten
thousand pounds and some more than thirty thousand pounds each, out of those taxes which you
help to pay, and which emoluments not a man of them proposes to give up. The clergy appear
very forward in this subscription. An Archbishop and a Bishop assisted at the forming of the
scheme. Now then, observe that there has been given out of the taxes, for several years past,
one hundred thousand pounds a year, for what, think you? Why for the relief of the poor clergy!
I have no account at hand later than that delivered last year, and there I find this sum!--for
the poor clergy! The rich clergy do not pay this sum; but it comes out of those taxes, part,
and a large part of which you pay on your beer, malt, salt, shoes, etc. I daresay that the
'decent firesides' of these poor clergy still connect themselves with the Government. I behold phantom

 But if they were all to give their whole pay,
and if they amount to one hundred and fifty thousand men, it would not amount to one-half of
what is now paid in Poor-rates, and of course would not add half a pound of bread to every
pound which the unhappy paupers now receive. All the expenses of the Army and Ordnance amount
to an enormous sum--to sixteen or eighteen millions; but the pay of one hundred and fifty thousand
men, at a shilling a day each, amounts to no more than two million seven hundred and twelve
thousand five hundred pounds.
