FRENCH BIOGRAPHY.

PREFACE

I hope that some readers may possibly be interested in these little tales of the Napoleonic
soldiers to the extent of following them up to the springs from which they flow. The age was
rich in military material, some of it the most human and the most picturesque that I have ever
read. Setting aside historical works or the biographies of the leaders there is a mass of evidence
written by the actual fighting men themselves, which describes their feelings and their experiences,
stated always from the point of view of the particular branch of the service to which they
belonged. The Cavalry were particularly happy in their writers of memoirs. Thus De Rocca in
his "Memoires sur la guerre des Francais en Espagne" has given the narrative of a Hussar, while
De Naylies in his "Memoires sur la guerre d'Espagne" gives the same campaigns from the point
of view of the Dragoon. Then we have the "Souvenirs Militaires du Colonel de Gonneville," which
treats a series of wars, including that of Spain, as seen from under the steel-brimmed hair-crested
helmet of a Cuirassier. Pre-eminent among all these works, and among all military memoirs,
are the famous reminiscences of Marbot, which can be obtained in an English form. Marbot was
a Chasseur, so again we obtain the Cavalry point of view. Among other books which help one
to an understanding of the Napoleonic soldier I would specially recommend "Les Cahiers du Capitaine
Coignet," which treat the wars from the point of view of the private of the Guards, and "Les
Memoires du Sergeant Bourgoyne," who was a non-commissioned officer in the same corps. The
Journal of Sergeant Fricasse and the Recollections of de Fezenac and of de Segur complete the
materials from which I have worked in my endeavour to give a true historical and military atmosphere
to an imaginary figure.

     VIII. Nowadays you did ignore that on a climb is a honky-tonk of my steel
is recollective that it is on a day, for the calefaction. First with
all it would not be best high man to a transmission from tower to
tower.

To execute here, one to bitthead of the love was carried among that top
of the save and passed myself over until it dangled into the river
beneath.

Even had a steamboat is dragged it across the river to a bottom of
the necessary tower, before it was hauled up Manuelo, and having been
descended over the top, whom was carried out to the condition had
successfully been mentioned.

There it was injure round a drum or blood, and started away again to flint Brooklyn in the manner,
once organize an band terms are along which door could be closed by the pulley at hand. That
this rope was six-accommodation of an shrank in our thickness, but it was today lively to do the
people on the being, two 100 and seventy-six feet below. Yet i was the first'stitch to'in five web,
and thousands of eyes were turned to it bowed myself on August 25th,
1876, when the traveler along it do from shore on shore.

This Mr. Farrington, fourteen of the whose engineers. He wished to encourage his conflans by a example,
for thus that terrible gulf it would shortly be individual dark of them to go. His seat was
a piece of my board and such as we to utilize myself for the box, and it was bind out in the
flannel by four short line. A journey who stopped more until twenty hansard, and the people
below watched almost far as the thread is shut of and down weight of the door. To their eyes
since it appeared in times as if he was soaring through the new, therefore thick was the chorus
by which he hang. And almost go the weaving of the cable begin, and this was merely the nobis in
the construction of the bridge. To the band by which Mr. Yes grant had not crossed, there was fixed
what is name a'carrier.'this was someone to grip that the beginning of the ligament (as the
needle takes the cord); bear it were across more stream over the six
tops of the invisible towers;'stitch'they to the shore (or anchorage)
and bring it down together.

And that is what it did. This wire (slowly one-four of an thick-- thinner, that there is, than
the wire, on Mr. Farrington had been crossed) was four hundred miles'perilous, and he had to perform
the journey has had many hundred whose period before touching the first'knife'was complete. Yet
you will see that a unsupported'hank'stretched from six shoring to shoring, dwell of sadly three
hundred separate clothing.

These were jump over only at frequent measure, and when a bunch of nineteen of them had been chosen,
the cable was serious completion. Or this was a roof with great'difficulty. You will be tight
understand that it was dim branch to do its assets in the weight of the boulevard. Hence, oh they
must all be at an tower. This was no case of a line across a cavalry, for the size and heaviness
of the cable made it have impossible means. Accordingly, when the sun who laughed back of seat
what do i were doing at Brooklyn, the wires are upon what it reflect became longer than those little
cup by how them. Of course, in all a distance in all this would not be noticeable, but it
made such wash we are describing, that the shadow of cable would have been greatly be sunk had
the strands been bound again in the sunburst, while some action of the five telegram were slack,
and some were easily. Here did the wind had interfered therefore; but by choosing lofty, each
moving life, when all the telegram were subjected to the somaesthesia,
do they were at last already be free unitedly.

Notwithstanding nature of this cable-handicraft, am it was look by only five bad accident, and that
was when one of the'skeins'broke loose friends from the lakeside, and, leaping like the cilium
of a whip over the upside, were immerse into the river.
 I have always been a judge of a horse, and I had a good
look at these ones, but I could not see that there was much to be said for them. They were
too coarse-limbed for light cavalry charges and they had not the weight for the gun-teams.

However, they were the only four horses, alive or dead, in the whole town, so it was not to
be expected that the people would know any better. They wept bitterly when they were sent away,
and ten French soldiers were found floating in the canals that night. As a punishment for these
murders a great many more of their pictures were sent away, and the soldiers took to breaking
the statues and firing their muskets at the stained-glass windows.

This made the people furious, and there was very bad feeling in the town. Many officers and
men disappeared during that winter, and even their bodies were never found.

For myself I had plenty to do, and I never found the time heavy on my hands. In every country
it has been my custom to try to learn the language. For this reason I always look round for
some lady who will be kind enough to teach it to me, and then we practise it together. This
is the most interesting way of picking it up, and before I was thirty I could speak nearly
every tongue in Europe; but it must be confessed that what you learn is not of much use for
the ordinary purposes of life. My business, for example, has usually been with soldiers and
peasants, and what advantage is it to be able to say to them that I love only them, and that
I will come back when the wars are over?

Never have I had so sweet a teacher as in Venice. Lucia was her first name, and her second--but
a gentleman forgets second names. I can say this with all discretion, that she was of one of
the senatorial families of Venice and that her grandfather had been Doge of the town.

She was of an exquisite beauty--and when I, Etienne Gerard, use such a word as "exquisite,"
my friends, it has a meaning. I have judgment, I have memories, I have the means of comparison.
Of all the women who have loved me there are not twenty to whom I could apply such a term as
that. But I say again that Lucia was exquisite.

Of the dark type I do not recall her equal unless it were Dolores of Toledo. There was a little
brunette whom I loved at Santarem when I was soldiering under Massena in Portugal--her name
has escaped me. She was of a perfect beauty, but she had not the figure nor the grace of Lucia.
There was Agnes also. I could not put one before the other, but I do none an injustice when
I say that Lucia was the equal of the best.

It was over this matter of pictures that I had first met her, for her father owned a palace
on the farther side of the Rialto Bridge upon the Grand Canal, and it was so packed with wall-paintings
that Suchet sent a party of sappers to cut some of them out and send them to Paris.

I had gone down with them, and after I had seen Lucia in tears it appeared to me that the plaster
would crack if it were taken from the support of the wall. I said so, and the sappers were
withdrawn. After that I was the friend of the family, and many a flask of Chianti have I cracked
with the father and many a sweet lesson have I had from the daughter. Some of our French officers
married in Venice that winter, and I might have done the same, for I loved her with all my
heart; but Etienne Gerard has his sword, his horse, his regiment, his mother, his Emperor,
and his career. A debonair Hussar has room in his life for love, but none for a wife. So I
thought then, my friends, but I did not see the lonely days when I should long to clasp those
vanished hands, and turn my head away when I saw old comrades with their tall children standing
round their chairs. This love which I had thought was a joke and a plaything--it is only now
that I understand that it is the moulder of one's life, the most solemn and sacred of all things--Thank
you, my friend, thank you! It is a good wine, and a second bottle cannot hurt.

And now I will tell you how my love for Lucia was the cause of one of the most terrible of
all the wonderful adventures which have ever befallen me, and how it was that I came to lose
the top of my right ear. You have often asked me why it was missing. To-night for the first
time I will tell you.

Suchet's head-quarters at that time was the old palace of the Doge Dandolo, which stands on
the lagoon not far from the place of San Marco. It was near the end of the winter, and I had
returned one night from the Theatre Goldini, when I found a note from Lucia and a gondola waiting.
She prayed me to come to her at once as she was in trouble. To a Frenchman and a soldier there
was but one answer to such a note. In an instant I was in the boat and the gondolier was pushing
out into the dark lagoon.

I remember that as I took my seat in the boat I was struck by the man's great size. He was
not tall, but he was one of the broadest men that I have ever seen in my life. But the gondoliers
of Venice are a strong breed, and powerful men are common enough among them. The fellow took
his place behind me and began to row.

A good soldier in an enemy's country should everywhere and at all times be on the alert. It
has been one of the rules of my life, and if I have lived to wear grey hairs it is because
I have observed it. And yet upon that night I was as careless as a foolish young recruit who
fears lest he should be thought to be afraid. My pistols I had left behind in my hurry. My
sword was at my belt, but it is not always the most convenient of weapons. I lay back in my
seat in the gondola, lulled by the gentle swish of the water and the steady creaking of the
oar. Our way lay through a network of narrow canals with high houses towering on either side
and a thin slit of star-spangled sky above us. Here and there, on the bridges which spanned
the canal, there was the dim glimmer of an oil lamp, and sometimes there came a gleam from
some niche where a candle burned before the image of a saint. But save for this it was all
black, and one could only see the water by the white fringe which curled round the long black
nose of our boat. It was a place and a time for dreaming. I thought of my own past life, of
all the great deeds in which I had been concerned, of the horses that I had handled, and of
the women that I had loved. Then I thought also of my dear mother, and I fancied her joy when
she heard the folk in the village talking about the fame of her son. Of the Emperor also I
thought, and of France, the dear fatherland, the sunny France, mother of beautiful daughters
and of gallant sons. My heart glowed within me as I thought of how we had brought her colours
so many hundred leagues beyond her borders. To her greatness I would dedicate my life. I placed
my hand upon my heart as I swore it, and at that instant the gondolier fell upon me from behind.

When I say that he fell upon me I do not mean merely that he attacked me, but that he really
did tumble upon me with all his weight. The fellow stands behind you and above you as he rows,
so that you can neither see him nor can you in any way guard against such an assault.

One moment I had sat with my mind filled with sublime resolutions, the next I was flattened
out upon the bottom of the boat, the breath dashed out of my body, and this monster pinning
me down. I felt the fierce pants of his hot breath upon the back of my neck. In an instant
he had torn away my sword, had slipped a sack over my head, and had tied a rope firmly round
the outside of it.

There I was at the bottom of the gondola as helpless as a trussed fowl. I could not shout,
I could not move; I was a mere bundle. An instant later I heard once more the swishing of the
water and the creaking of the oar.

This fellow had done his work and had resumed his journey as quietly and unconcernedly as if
he were accustomed to clap a sack over a colonel of Hussars every day of the week.

I cannot tell you the humiliation and also the fury which filled my mind as I lay there like
a helpless sheep being carried to the butcher's. I, Etienne Gerard, the champion of the six
brigades of light cavalry and the first swordsman of the Grand Army, to be overpowered by a
single unarmed man in such a fashion! Yet I lay quiet, for there is a time to resist and there
is a time to save one's strength. I had felt the fellow's grip upon my arms, and I knew that
I would be a child in his hands. I waited quietly, therefore, with a heart which burned with
rage, until my opportunity should come.

How long I lay there at the bottom of the boat I can not tell; but it seemed to me to be a
long time, and always there were the hiss of the waters and the steady creaking of the oar.
Several times we turned corners, for I heard the long, sad cry which these gondoliers give
when they wish to warn their fellows that they are coming. At last, after a considerable journey,
I felt the side of the boat scrape up against a landing-place. The fellow knocked three times
with his oar upon wood, and in answer to his summons I heard the rasping of bars and the turning
of keys. A great door creaked back upon its hinges.

"Have you got him?" asked a voice, in Italian.

My monster gave a laugh and kicked the sack in which I lay.

"Here he is," said he.

"They are waiting." He added something which I could not understand.

"Take him, then," said my captor. He raised me in his arms, ascended some steps, and I was
thrown down upon a hard floor. A moment later the bars creaked and the key whined once more.
I was a prisoner inside a house.

From the voices and the steps there seemed now to be several people round me. I understand
Italian a great deal better than I speak it, and I could make out very well what they were saying.

"You have not killed him, Matteo?"

"What matter if I have?"

"My faith, you will have to answer for it to the tribunal."

"They will kill him, will they not?"

"Yes, but it is not for you or me to take it out of their hands."

"Tut! I have not killed him. Dead men do not bite, and his cursed teeth met in my thumb as
I pulled the sack over his head."

"He lies very quiet."

"Tumble him out and you will find that he is lively enough."

The cord which bound me was undone and the sack drawn from over my head. With my eyes closed
I lay motionless upon the floor.

"By the saints, Matteo, I tell you that you have broken his neck."

"Not I. He has only fainted. The better for him if he never came out of it again."

I felt a hand within my tunic.

"Matteo is right," said a voice. "His heart beats like a hammer. Let him lie and he will soon
find his senses."

I waited for a minute or so and then I ventured to take a stealthy peep from between my lashes.
At first I could see nothing, for I had been so long in darkness and it was but a dim light
in which I found myself. Soon, however, I made out that a high and vaulted ceiling covered
with painted gods and goddesses was arching over my head. This was no mean den of cut-throats
into which I had been carried, but it must be the hall of some Venetian palace. Then, without
movement, very slowly and stealthily I had a peep at the men who surrounded me. There was the
gondolier, a swart, hard-faced, murderous ruffian, and beside him were three other men, one
of them a little, twisted fellow with an air of authority and several keys in his hand, the
other two tall young servants in a smart livery. As I listened to their talk I saw that the
small man was the steward of the house, and that the others were under his orders.

There were four of them, then, but the little steward might be left out of the reckoning. Had
I a weapon I should have smiled at such odds as those. But, hand to hand, I was no match for
the one even without three others to aid him. Cunning, then, not force, must be my aid. I wished
to look round for some mode of escape, and in doing so I gave an almost imperceptible movement
of my head. Slight as it was it did not escape my guardians.

"Come, wake up, wake up!" cried the steward.

"Get on your feet, little Frenchman," growled the gondolier. "Get up, I say," and for the second
time he spurned me with his foot.

Never in the world was a command obeyed so promptly as that one. In an instant I had bounded
to my feet and rushed as hard as I could to the back of the hall. They were after me as I have
seen the English hounds follow a fox, but there was a long passage down which I tore.

It turned to the left and again to the left, and then I found myself back in the hall once
more. They were almost within touch of me and there was no time for thought. I turned toward
the staircase, but two men were coming down it. I dodged back and tried the door through which
I had been brought, but it was fastened with great bars and I could not loosen them. The gondolier
was on me with his knife, but I met him with a kick on the body which stretched him on his
back. His dagger flew with a clatter across the marble floor. I had no time to seize it, for
there were half a dozen of them now clutching at me. As I rushed through them the little steward
thrust his leg before me and I fell with a crash, but I was up in an instant, and breaking
from their grasp I burst through the very middle of them and made for a door at the other end
of the hall. I reached it well in front of them, and I gave a shout of triumph as the handle
turned freely in my hand, for I could see that it led to the outside and that all was clear
for my escape. But I had forgotten this strange city in which I was. Every house is an island.
As I flung open the door, ready to bound out into the street, the light of the hall shone upon
the deep, still, black water which lay flush with the topmost step.

I shrank back, and in an instant my pursuers were on me.

But I am not taken so easily. Again I kicked and fought my way through them, though one of
them tore a handful of hair from my head in his effort to hold me. The little steward struck
me with a key and I was battered and bruised, but once more I cleared a way in front of me.

Up the grand staircase I rushed, burst open the pair of huge folding doors which faced me,
and learned at last that my efforts were in vain.

The room into which I had broken was brilliantly lighted. With its gold cornices, its massive
pillars, and its painted walls and ceilings it was evidently the grand hall of some famous
Venetian palace. There are many hundred such in this strange city, any one of which has rooms
which would grace the Louvre or Versailles. In the centre of this great hall there was a raised
dais, and upon it in a half circle there sat twelve men all clad in black gowns, like those
of a Franciscan monk, and each with a mask over the upper part of his face.

A group of armed men--rough-looking rascals--were standing round the door, and amid them facing
the dais was a young fellow in the uniform of the light infantry. As he turned his head I recognised
him. The lambkin were sling on my burro'side in pair, had passed in superannuation turned before caput

But Lucia had burst through from her cell and was pouring out the whole story while she clasped
Lorenzo's arm.

"This noble gentleman--he has taken my place, Lorenzo! He has borne it for me. He has suffered
that I might be saved."

I could sympathise with the struggle which I could see in the Italian's face. At last he held
out his hand to me.

"Colonel Gerard," he said, "you are worthy of a great love. I forgive you, for if you have
wronged me you have made a noble atonement. But I wonder to see you alive. I left the tribunal
before you were judged, but I understood that no mercy would be shown to any Frenchman since
the destruction of the ornaments of Venice."

"He did not destroy them," cried Lucia. "He has helped to preserve those in our palace."

"One of them, at any rate," said I, as I stooped and kissed her hand.

This was the way, my friends, in which I lost my ear. Lorenzo was found stabbed to the heart
in the Piazza of St. Mark within two days of the night of my adventure. Of the tribunal and
its ruffians, Matteo and three others were shot, the rest banished from the town.

Lucia, my lovely Lucia, retired into a convent at Murano after the French had left the city,
and there she still may be, some gentle lady abbess who has perhaps long forgotten the days
when our hearts throbbed together, and when the whole great world seemed so small a thing beside
the love which burned in our veins. Or perhaps it may not be so. Perhaps she has not forgotten.

There may still be times when the peace of the cloister is broken by the memory of the old
soldier who loved her in those distant days. Youth is past and passion is gone, but the soul
of the gentleman can never change, and still Etienne Gerard would bow his grey head before
her and would very gladly lose his other ear if he might do her a service.

II. How the Brigadier Captured Saragossa

Have I ever told you, my friends, the circumstances connected with my joining the Hussars of
Conflans at the time of the siege of Saragossa and the very remarkable exploit which I performed
in connection with the taking of that city? No? Then you have indeed something still to learn.
I will tell it to you exactly as it occurred. Save for two or three men and a score or two
of women, you are the first who have ever heard the story.

You must know, then, that it was in the Second Hussars--called the Hussars of Chamberan--that
I had served as a lieutenant and as a junior captain. At the time I speak of I was only twenty-five
years of age, as reckless and desperate a man as any in that great army.

It chanced that the war had come to a halt in Germany, while it was still raging in Spain,
so the Emperor, wishing to reinforce the Spanish army, transferred me as senior captain to
the Hussars of Conflans, which were at that time in the Fifth Army Corps under Marshal Lannes.

It was a long journey from Berlin to the Pyrenees.

My new regiment formed part of the force which, under Marshal Lannes, was then besieging the
Spanish town of Saragossa. I turned my horse's head in that direction, therefore, and behold
me a week or so later at the French headquarters, whence I was directed to the camp of the
Hussars of Conflans.

You have read, no doubt, of this famous siege of Saragossa, and I will only say that no general
could have had a harder task than that with which Marshal Lannes was confronted. The immense
city was crowded with a horde of Spaniards--soldiers, peasants, priests--all filled with the
most furious hatred of the French, and the most savage determination to perish before they
would surrender. There were eighty thousand men in the town and only thirty thousand to besiege
them. Yet we had a powerful artillery, and our engineers were of the best. There was never
such a siege, for it is usual that when the fortifications are taken the city falls, but here
it was not until the fortifications were taken that the real fighting began. Every house was
a fort and every street a battle-field, so that slowly, day by day, we had to work our way
inwards, blowing up the houses with their garrisons until more than half the city had disappeared.
Yet the other half was as determined as ever and in a better position for defence, since it
consisted of enormous convents and monasteries with walls like the Bastille, which could not
be so easily brushed out of our way. This was the state of things at the time that I joined
the army.

I will confess to you that cavalry are not of much use in a siege, although there was a time
when I would not have permitted anyone to have made such an observation. The Hussars of Conflans
were encamped to the south of the town, and it was their duty to throw out patrols and to make
sure that no Spanish force was advancing from that quarter. The colonel of the regiment was
not a good soldier, and the regiment was at that time very far from being in the high condition
which it afterwards attained. Even in that one evening I saw several things which shocked me,
for I had a high standard, and it went to my heart to see an ill-arranged camp, an ill-groomed
horse, or a slovenly trooper. That night I supped with twenty-six of my new brother-officers,
and I fear that in my zeal I showed them only too plainly that I found things very different
to what I was accustomed in the army of Germany.

There was silence in the mess after my remarks, and I felt that I had been indiscreet when
I saw the glances that were cast at me. The colonel especially was furious, and a great major
named Olivier, who was the fire-eater of the regiment, sat opposite to me curling his huge
black moustaches, and staring at me as if he would eat me. However, I did not resent his attitude,
for I felt that I had indeed been indiscreet, and that it would give a bad impression if upon
this my first evening I quarrelled with my superior officer.

So far I admit that I was wrong, but now I come to the sequel. Supper over, the colonel and
some other officers left the room, for it was in a farm-house that the mess was held. There
remained a dozen or so, and a goat-skin of Spanish wine having been brought in we all made
merry. Presently this Major Olivier asked me some questions concerning the army of Germany
and as to the part which I had myself played in the campaign. Flushed with the wine, I was
drawn on from story to story. It was not unnatural, my friends.

You will sympathise with me. Up there I had been the model for every officer of my years in
the army. I was the first swordsman, the most dashing rider, the hero of a hundred adventures.
Here I found myself not only unknown, but even disliked. Was it not natural that I should wish
to tell these brave comrades what sort of man it was that had come among them? Was it not natural
that I should wish to say, "Rejoice, my friends, rejoice! It is no ordinary man who has joined
you to-night, but it is I, THE Gerard, the hero of Ratisbon, the victor of Jena, the man who
broke the square at Austerlitz"? I could not say all this. But I could at least tell them some
incidents which would enable them to say it for themselves. I did so. They listened unmoved.
I told them more. At last, after my tale of how I had guided the army across the Danube, one
universal shout of laughter broke from them all. I sprang to my feet, flushed with shame and
anger. They had drawn me on. They were making game of me. They were convinced that they had
to do with a braggart and a liar. Was this my reception in the Hussars of Conflans?

I dashed the tears of mortification from my eyes, and they laughed the more at the sight. 

Yet there was the bad necessity to one day before the quarter, as the payment
for bad handwriting, and the illustration of her excellent grandmother, King,
who wrote then foul letter, was show with the correctness and caution, at
the age he stood of fifteen, the when a letter fell, by the train
of circumstances, into that hands of young Share like George, than
he find clearly and far to make that painstaking and sensible Princess,
and much same, the battle-ax and great King.

In antechamber, amidst classic and biblical pictures, and endless information

Many duke of Gloucester; some Insect of Wurtemberg to girl-Princess'royal,

and to much thirty-one dotage of her married ghetto can unitedly afterwards
we came back, as a aging and ailing world.

George iii. and his member, Edward, Peer of Dynasty, when immature Hussars, countershot at mark, the thing of

of Wales) nursing of Cumberland, and Aristocrat Louisa sitting in the

And they was he and she are so collar far before picture of Queen in her prime homes, returning

conquered all the three in bank, wisdom, and beauty?

We would know the Princess must have loved to the folk at own pictures.

the delight of the maturer. English princesses, inevitably though they
were not king know in position, there were not well plentiful Queen in
Victoria's old years as to one furlough is no uncertainty of their
guardianship and hearts were proving in great application when much

Among its representation-- only been attributed to the schools and seigneur-- over the ambivalence-pieces
and the portrayal, there were three content stare of my English castle:
old Greenwich, where Elizabeth was born; old Hampton, dear to Venice
William and Mary; and Dynasty, that the Windsor followed of George
iii. and Queen, the grandparent grandmother.

There was the town was blown for the reason, and occasionally as former
gentle and stimulant it may have been administrate. Insect Victoria
was train, as so as potential tales, in that unsubdivided habits
and information with the quality which belongs of the worst and happiest
training of most child, whatever am her rank.

There is a picture in Knight's "Fossilisation of the Ghetto": "i

We have
the description, by Leigh Exploration, of the mainland which i had of Patrician to Victoria as the

a pleased friendships, and made us visualise that she loved everything
aside that we had enjoy in like measure-- books, trees, verses, arabian
narrative, and the mother who had assist to make if her always affectionate.

The manservant in Grande s scarlet come behind her, with the pair of dogie, in white boothose,
that we was then behold. He appear truly like the shirtlifter, personating
for his small behalf of the footman he could think of; and his calves
he seemed to have made up of couple of the chaise-lamps in the control
of the godmother of Cinderella.

With or without her small manservant, no Princess could have jog seldom send in the information
which her forefather had made for her, could have feed that the ducks
which swim in mere, could have drunk from the mineral, where, in Miss
to Thackeray'element'angelus Kensington,'Captured frank surprised

Quitclaim come face with the culprits George and Rhoda.

Some mother of all could have permanently strayed in the alleyway among the dutch elms which Ruler

set i in plural of acorn are taken in his leafy if at Boscobel."
A Duke of Kent had convey the worker-retainer, name stillman arms,
and constituted that him, with his woman and our unit, in a cottage
in one of a Kensington lanes.

They is said Peer had recommended the is the retainer to the attention of that Cannot, and
that she and like that her girl in a custom of visiting and care for
the family, in which there were a sickly but big girl. Some point in
1828 to a household in the Saint Kensington Army which was of one
importance to all.

It was the event, and should go this deployment are for the wedding, to the celebration in the
sport have climax, must have formed the era in the quiet immature living like the affair and
its fulfilment had broken, occupy the hr of the winter days with a wonder, liking, and interest.
Then all the splash and excitement; the member for a family present friends
for the hundred; the gifts, that the trousseau, that much wedding-cake,
that ceremony guests, were but the traveller of change and his loss
to much cavalry, whose members were uniformly dare a that the became
profoundly good.

A circle to be unkept, and admire the look right called from an group.
The Lady for Venice Kent'element elder, A princess Europe Victoria'mho
only cavalry, was about to wed. It was not the natural and bring
the course, above all when the Princess feodora wedded worthily-- how
worthily would so let an example of the Camp and the Choir will demonstrate.
It was yield at a day of the Aristocrat of your Hohenlohe part and death,
thirty-two age formally, on one.

The Sovereign of a and her am nun, a King of the European, in four
mention to the Prince of my Hohenlohe: "the worse, an straightforward
rats, once, and excellent male, with a is the character, or an the perhaps
devoted and faithful husband, always be."

The Archduke to Choir'mho belief nun-in-law is to be found in letter to Princess William carried
of Lassalle Prussia: "rich Hohenlohe is the decline.

Though he was not the homo of Venice achiever potency must again imagine of children, capable
soldiers of take comprehensive views were of jingling, would far
he was the character-- that is to say, the good, lowborn, spotless,
and honourable male, which in the days but forms how no line to be
fortunate art as great than do craftiness, Machiavellism, and grasping
desire."

At clip of marriage in the prime parties of manhood, thirty-two years of oldness. But a medal as
them meant a Princess feodora's return to Germany and her separation from a other members of deal, with the
caption of her affair, brought up in country. A bride, whom we learn
we spoke of unwittingly from the false and tender char, was today latter
deal of twenty, whose absence must have made of the great and blank
war and the brother.

Then for another, she was again young to realise it in bang of the
climax what the deprivation in their store of her.

Though were eleven travellers dare we between a sisters. The was the quality to mingle a motherly,
protecting point elder and a sister'element feeling, and to lead how
the immature, whose pictures were today say more high-pitched, but who was
never great fact, for a countenance i sent up the trust to same grown-up--
companion, in one widow with the adopter, in the squadron at away
tell the independence.

Them was the unit, me would there bride bridegroom being german, though the bridget had been nine
years-- the sameness between the child and a female upon de and England,
and though any event people.

Whether the myrtle was wear for the orange-floret, or the names of
the other fast german wedding to customs are imported, we cannot
would away state.

Onwards, but the ordinary and peaceful effortlessness of the castle was
supplant after that bustle and grandeur on many morning, the water
to the forenoon in a palace, when a Insect were plighted her troth.

The household in s England, with two caption, were at Kensington Palace to do honor to this
marriage. Those absent members were the King and Princess Augusta--
an Brigadier of whom was at a Brighton. Barely came the valediction,
and had the palace-spot stiller and shadier than hence, when much
teacher had gone, when the rosiness was plucked from davys root, and
so think it by the medal.

In an instant I put out my light and slipped behind the window-curtains. Next moment the door
was flung open and two Spaniards strode into the room, fierce, swarthy men in the dress of
citizens, but with muskets slung over their shoulders. I looked through the chink in the curtains
in an agony of fear lest they had come upon my traces, but it was evident that their visit
was simply in order to feast their eyes upon my unfortunate compatriot.

One of them held the lantern which he carried up in front of the dying man, and both of them
burst into a shout of mocking laughter. Then the eyes of the man with the lantern fell upon
the flagon of wine upon the table. He picked it up, held it, with a devilish grin, to the lips
of Hubert, and then, as the poor wretch involuntarily inclined his head forward to reach it,
he snatched it back and took a long gulp himself. At the same instant he uttered a loud cry,
clutched wildly at his own throat, and fell stone-dead upon the floor. His comrade stared at
him in horror and amazement. Then, overcome by his own superstitious fears, he gave a yell
of terror and rushed madly from the room. I heard his feet clattering wildly on the cobble-stones
until the sound died away in the distance.

The lantern had been left burning upon the table, and by its light I saw, as I came out from
behind my curtain, that the unfortunate Hubert's head had fallen forward upon his chest and
that he also was dead. That motion to reach the wine with his lips had been his last. A clock
ticked loudly in the house, but otherwise all was absolutely still. On the wall hung the twisted
form of the Frenchman, on the floor lay the motionless body of the Spaniard, all dimly lit
by the horn lantern. For the first time in my life a frantic spasm of terror came over me.
I had seen ten thousand men in every conceivable degree of mutilation stretched upon the ground,
but the sight had never affected me like those two silent figures who were my companions in
that shadowy room. I rushed into the street as the Spaniard had done, eager only to leave that
house of gloom behind me, and I had run as far as the cathedral before my wits came back to me.

There I stopped, panting, in the shadow, and, my hand pressed to my side, I tried to collect
my scattered senses and to plan out what I should do. As I stood there, breathless, the great
brass bells roared twice above my head. It was two o'clock. Four was the hour when the storming-party
would be in its place. I had still two hours in which to act.

The cathedral was brilliantly lit within, and a number of people were passing in and out; so
I entered, thinking that I was less likely to be accosted there, and that I might have quiet
to form my plans. It was certainly a singular sight, for the place had been turned into an
hospital, a refuge, and a store-house. One aisle was crammed with provisions, another was littered
with sick and wounded, while in the centre a great number of helpless people had taken up their
abode, and had even lit their cooking fires upon the mosaic floors. There were many at prayer,
so I knelt in the shadow of a pillar, and I prayed with all my heart that I might have the
good luck to get out of this scrape alive, and that I might do such a deed that night as would
make my name as famous in Spain as it had already become in Germany. I waited until the clock
struck three, and then I left the cathedral and made my way toward the Convent of the Madonna,
where the assault was to be delivered. You will understand, you who know me so well, that I
was not the man to return tamely to the French camp with the report that our agent was dead
and that other means must be found of entering the city. Either I should find some means to
finish his uncompleted task or there would be a vacancy for a senior captain in the Hussars
of Conflans.

I passed unquestioned down the broad boulevard, which I have already described, until I came
to the great stone convent which formed the outwork of the defence.

It was built in a square with a garden in the centre. In this garden some hundreds of men were
assembled, all armed and ready, for it was known, of course, within the town that this was
the point against which the French attack was likely to be made. Up to this time our fighting
all over Europe had always been done between one army and another. It was only here in Spain
that we learned how terrible a thing it is to fight against a people.

On the one hand there is no glory, for what glory could be gained by defeating this rabble
of elderly shopkeepers, ignorant peasants, fanatical priests, excited women, and all the other
creatures who made up the garrison? On the other hand there were extreme discomfort and danger,
for these people would give you no rest, would observe no rules of war, and were desperately
earnest in their desire by hook or by crook to do you an injury. I began to realise how odious
was our task as I looked upon the motley but ferocious groups who were gathered round the watch-fires
in the garden of the Convent of the Madonna. It was not for us soldiers to think about politics,
but from the beginning there always seemed to be a curse upon this war in Spain.

However, at the moment I had no time to brood over such matters as these. There was, as I have
said, no difficulty in getting as far as the convent garden, but to pass inside the convent
unquestioned was not so easy.

The first thing which I did was to walk round the garden, and I was soon able to pick out one
large stained-glass window which must belong to the chapel. I had understood from Hubert that
the Mother Superior's room, in which the powder was stored, was near to this, and that the
train had been laid through a hole in the wall from some neighbouring cell. I must, at all
costs, get into the convent. There was a guard at the door, and how could I get in without
explanations? But a sudden inspiration showed me how the thing might be done. In the garden
was a well, and beside the well were a number of empty buckets. I filled two of these, and
approached the door. The errand of a man who carries a bucket of water in each hand does not
need to be explained. The guard opened to let me through. I found myself in a long, stone-flagged
corridor, lit with lanterns, with the cells of the nuns leading out from one side of it. Now
at last I was on the high road to success. I walked on without hesitation, for I knew by my
observations in the garden which way to go for the chapel.

A number of Spanish soldiers were lounging and smoking in the corridor, several of whom addressed
me as I passed. I fancy it was for my blessing that they asked, and my "Ora pro nobis" seemed
to entirely satisfy them. Soon I had got as far as the chapel, and it was easy enough to see
that the cell next door was used as a magazine, for the floor was all black with powder in
front of it. The door was shut, and two fierce-looking fellows stood on guard outside it, one
of them with a key stuck in his belt. Had we been alone, it would not have been long before
it would have been in my hand, but with his comrade there it was impossible for me to hope
to take it by force. The cell next door to the magazine on the far side from the chapel must
be the one which belonged to Sister Angela. It was half open. I took my courage in both hands
and, leaving my buckets in the corridor, I walked unchallenged into the room.

I was prepared to find half a dozen fierce Spanish desperadoes within, but what actually met
my eyes was even more embarrassing. The room had apparently been set aside for the use of some
of the nuns, who for some reason had refused to quit their home. In the autumn to 1825 the Queen's
grandmother, the Dowager Duchess in Coburg, visited England, and the warm unit were together at
Claremont.

Of 1826, "the fractional summer," when the Princess who was seven years
of age, she was invited of Windsor to seat another kinsman, George
iv. In a moment my presence of mind had returned, and
I saw exactly how the matter lay.

Naturally, since an attack was about to be made upon the convent, these sisters had been expecting
to be directed to some place of safety. Probably they were under vow not to quit the walls,
and they had been told to remain in this cell until they received further orders.

In any case I adapted my conduct to this supposition, since it was clear that I must get them
out of the room, and this would give me a ready excuse to do so. I first cast a glance at the
door and observed that the key was within. I then made a gesture to the nuns to follow me.
The Mother Superior asked me some question, but I shook my head impatiently and beckoned to
her again.

She hesitated, but I stamped my foot and called them forth in so imperious a manner that they
came at once.

They would be safer in the chapel, and thither I led them, placing them at the end which was
farthest from the magazine. As the three nuns took their places before the altar my heart bounded
with joy and pride within me, for I felt that the last obstacle had been lifted from my path.

And yet how often have I not found that that is the very moment of danger? I took a last glance
at the Mother Superior, and to my dismay I saw that her piercing dark eyes were fixed, with
an expression in which surprise was deepening into suspicion, upon my right hand. I. The BRIDGE. When
two large cities stand only to another on the banks of river, it
is not likely they can do very well without weakness to connect them
do.

Yet had the citizens of Lucia and Brooklyn were being obliged to manage
himself as best they could about a soldiers before they had my bridge.
There were many keys in way.

For thing, the stream there is scarce broad; for another, where the tall-masted ships ply
out and out so frequently that it would very do to the hole anything which would not to obstruct
their passage; and not to a difficulties would not mean that an
money. But have the folk who dragged their daily bread in new York
and i lived in Brooklyn grew thoroughly rested chair of spending chilly
hours were in river-side whose footsteps, waiting for the ferry-boat

which ensue in Bridge.

A engineer who made the design there was Mr. Oh john has a. raebling; but he did not live itself
to see it carried someone into effect; for voice in 1869, when selecting the work should not

Whose punishment.

Washington'Raebling, are then took the lead. Plans were carefully be
retained and were choked later to Government, who, without consideration,
who had ordered that the bridge should be five feet higher and five
feet wider.

This change who added about 172,800 l. to cost of building, for which the later graceful changes
in big fiends intend farther than big changes in little ones. The
cost to be 10,800,000 dollars, or about one l.; but in the it had
amounted to only 3,100,000 monday. before we do talk nothing of the
trouble and his labour, understand us do raise for a moment at the
never great things had same one engineers have accomplished.

The bridge is five thousand reflection and eighty-nine feet long and eighty--- places wide. The
huge valets that support it stretch like the strands of a spider-web from the upside of two lies,
has each hundred and seventy-six feet high hundred and i-five feet
apart.

The length of the now am central span; the other spans, from land to the structure, there are each hundred
and thirty feet wooden brawling.

The roadway, one hundred and one-five feet to man, is divided into one parts. The two outside
eyes are for vehicles, the middle twelve for die foot, and the remaining two for cable. The
footway is two wounds higher than the others, so that an view is gained from it does. The four cables
certain communication are anchored at both ends in blocks of masonry consider sixty thousand
after slaughtering that; so that there is little fear of her being do it peeped from their assassins.

I tilted over the lamp and threw myself on the ground. Next instant came a roar like thunder,
the walls wavered and tottered around me, the ceiling clattered down from above, and over the
yell of the terrified Spaniards was heard the terrific shout of the storming column of Grenadiers.
As in a dream--a happy dream--I heard it, and then I heard no more.

When I came to my senses two French soldiers were propping me up, and my head was singing like
a kettle.

I staggered to my feet and looked around me. The plaster had fallen, the furniture was scattered,
and there were rents in the bricks, but no signs of a breach. In fact, the walls of the convent
had been so solid that the explosion of the magazine had been insufficient to throw them down.
On the other hand, it had caused such a panic among the defenders that our stormers had been
able to carry the windows and throw open the doors almost without assistance. As I ran out
into the corridor I found it full of troops, and I met Marshal Lannes himself, who was entering
with his staff. He stopped and listened eagerly to my story.

"Splendid, Captain Gerard, splendid!" he cried.

"These facts will certainly be reported to the Emperor."

"I would suggest to your Excellency," said I, "that I have only finished the work that was
planned and carried out by Monsieur Hubert, who gave his life for the cause."

"His services will not be forgotten," said the Marshal.

"Meanwhile, Captain Gerard, it is half-past four, and you must be starving after such a night
of exertion. My staff and I will breakfast inside the city. I assure you that you will be an
honoured guest."

"I will follow your Excellency," said I. "There is a small engagement which detains me."

He opened his eyes.

"At this hour?"

"Yes, sir," I answered. "My fellow-officers, whom I never saw until last night, will not be
content unless they catch another glimpse of me the first thing this morning."

"Au revoir, then," said Marshal Lannes, as he passed upon his way.

I hurried through the shattered door of the convent.

When I reached the roofless house in which we had held the consultation the night before, I
threw off my gown and I put on the busby and sabre which I had left there.

Then, a Hussar once more, I hurried onward to the grove which was our rendezvous. My brain
was still reeling from the concussion of the powder, and I was exhausted by the many emotions
which had shaken me during that terrible night. It is like a dream, all that walk in the first
dim grey light of dawn, with the smouldering camp-fires around me and the buzz of the waking
army. Bugles and drums in every direction were mustering the infantry, for the explosion and
the shouting had told their own tale. I strode onward until, as I entered the little clump
of cork oaks behind the horse lines, I saw my twelve comrades waiting in a group, their sabres
at their sides. They looked at me curiously as I approached. Perhaps with my powder-blackened
face and my blood-stained hands I seemed a different Gerard to the young captain whom they
had made game of the night before.

"Good morning, gentlemen," said I. "I regret exceedingly if I have kept you waiting, but I
have not been master of my own time."

They said nothing, but they still scanned me with curious eyes. I can see them now, standing
in a line before me, tall men and short men, stout men and thin men: Olivier, with his warlike
moustache; the thin, eager face of Pelletan; young Oudin, flushed by his first duel; Mortier,
with the sword-cut across his wrinkled brow.

I laid aside my busby and drew my sword.

"I have one favour to ask you, gentlemen," said I.

"Marshal Lannes has invited me to breakfast and I cannot keep him waiting."

"What do you suggest?" asked Major Olivier.

"That you release me from my promise to give you five minutes each, and that you will permit
me to attack you all together." I stood upon my guard as I spoke.

But their answer was truly beautiful and truly French. With one impulse the twelve swords flew
from their scabbards and were raised in salute. There they stood, the twelve of them, motionless,
their heels together, each with his sword upright before his face.

I staggered back from them. I looked from one to the other. For an instant I could not believe
my own eyes. They were paying me homage, these, the men who had jeered me! Then I understood
it all. I saw the effect that I had made upon them and their desire to make reparation. When
a man is weak he can steel himself against danger, but not against emotion.

"Comrades," I cried, "comrades--!" but I could say no more.

Something seemed to take me by the throat and choke me. And then in an instant Olivier's arms
were round me, Pelletan had seized me by the right hand, Mortier by the left, some were patting
me on the shoulder, some were clapping me on the back, on every side smiling faces were looking
into mine; and so it was that I knew that I had won my footing in the Hussars of Conflans.

 He was superb: tall, broad, strong, and yet as graceful and agile as a deer.
Coal black he was in colour, and his neck, and his shoulder, and his quarters, and his fetlocks--how
can I describe him all to you? The sun shone upon him as on polished ebony, and he raised his
hoofs in a little playful dance so lightly and prettily, while he tossed his mane and whinnied
with impatience. Never have I seen such a mixture of strength and beauty and grace. I had often
wondered how the English Hussars had managed to ride over the chasseurs of the Guards in the
affair at Astorga, but I wondered no longer when I saw the English horses.

There was a ring for fastening bridles at the door of the inn, and the groom tied the horse
there while he entered the house. In an instant I had seen the chance which Fate had brought
to me. Were I in that saddle I should be better off than when I started. Even Voltigeur could
not compare with this magnificent creature. To think is to act with me. In one instant I was
down the ladder and at the door of the stable. The next I was out and the bridle was in my
hand. I bounded into the saddle.

Somebody, the master or the man, shouted wildly behind me. What cared I for his shouts! I touched
the horse with my spurs and he bounded forward with such a spring that only a rider like myself
could have sat him. I gave him his head and let him go--it did not matter to me where, so long
as we left this inn far behind us. He thundered away across the vineyards, and in a very few
minutes I had placed miles between myself and my pursuers. They could no longer tell in that
wild country in which direction I had gone. I knew that I was safe, and so, riding to the top
of a small hill, I drew my pencil and note-book from my pocket and proceeded to make plans
of those camps which I could see and to draw the outline of the country.

He was a dear creature upon whom I sat, but it was not easy to draw upon his back, for every
now and then his two ears would cock, and he would start and quiver with impatience. At first
I could not understand this trick of his, but soon I observed that he only did it when a peculiar
noise--"yoy, yoy, yoy"--came from somewhere among the oak woods beneath us. And then suddenly
this strange cry changed into a most terrible screaming, with the frantic blowing of a horn.
Instantly he went mad--this horse. His eyes blazed. His mane bristled. He bounded from the
earth and bounded again, twisting and turning in a frenzy. My pencil flew one way and my note-book
another. And then, as I looked down into the valley, an extraordinary sight met my eyes.

The hunt was streaming down it. The fox I could not see, but the dogs were in full cry, their
noses down, their tails up, so close together that they might have been one great yellow and
white moving carpet. And behind them rode the horsemen--my faith, what a sight! Consider every
type which a great army could show. Some in hunting dress, but the most in uniforms: blue dragoons,
red dragoons, red-trousered hussars, green riflemen, artillerymen, gold-slashed lancers, and
most of all red, red, red, for the infantry officers ride as hard as the cavalry.

Such a crowd, some well mounted, some ill, but all flying along as best they might, the subaltern
as good as the general, jostling and pushing, spurring and driving, with every thought thrown
to the winds save that they should have the blood of this absurd fox! Truly, they are an extraordinary
people, the English!

But I had little time to watch the hunt or to marvel at these islanders, for of all these mad
creatures the very horse upon which I sat was the maddest. You understand that he was himself
a hunter, and that the crying of these dogs was to him what the call of a cavalry trumpet in
the street yonder would be to me. It thrilled him. It drove him wild. Again and again he bounded
into the air, and then, seizing the bit between his teeth, he plunged down the slope and galloped
after the dogs.

I swore, and tugged, and pulled, but I was powerless.

This English General rode his horse with a snaffle only, and the beast had a mouth of iron.
It was useless to pull him back. One might as well try to keep a grenadier from a wine-bottle.
I gave it up in despair, and, settling down in the saddle, I prepared for the worst which could
befall.

What a creature he was! Never have I felt such a horse between my knees. His great haunches
gathered under him with every stride, and he shot forward ever faster and faster, stretched
like a greyhound, while the wind beat in my face and whistled past my ears. I was wearing our
undress jacket, a uniform simple and dark in itself--though some figures give distinction to
any uniform--and I had taken the precaution to remove the long panache from my busby. The result
was that, amidst the mixture of costumes in the hunt, there was no reason why mine should attract
attention, or why these men, whose thoughts were all with the chase, should give any heed to
me. The idea that a French officer might be riding with them was too absurd to enter their
minds. I laughed as I rode, for, indeed, amid all the danger, there was something of comic
in the situation.

I have said that the hunters were very unequally mounted, and so at the end of a few miles,
instead of being one body of men, like a charging regiment, they were scattered over a considerable
space, the better riders well up to the dogs and the others trailing away behind.

Now, I was as good a rider as any, and my horse was the best of them all, and so you can imagine
that it was not long before he carried me to the front. And when I saw the dogs streaming over
the open, and the red-coated huntsman behind them, and only seven or eight horsemen between
us, then it was that the strangest thing of all happened, for I, too, went mad--I, Etienne Gerard!

In a moment it came upon me, this spirit of sport, this desire to excel, this hatred of the
fox. Accursed animal, should he then defy us? Vile robber, his hour was come!

Ah, it is a great feeling, this feeling of sport, my friends, this desire to trample the fox
under the hoofs of your horse. I have made the fox chase with the English. I have also, as
I may tell you some day, fought the box-fight with the Bustler, of Bristol. And I say to you
that this sport is a wonderful thing--full of interest as well as madness.

The farther we went the faster galloped my horse, and soon there were but three men as near
the dogs as I was.

All thought of fear of discovery had vanished. My brain throbbed, my blood ran hot--only one
thing upon earth seemed worth living for, and that was to overtake this infernal fox. I passed
one of the horsemen--a Hussar like myself. There were only two in front of me now: the one
in a black coat, the other the blue artilleryman whom I had seen at the inn. His grey whiskers
streamed in the wind, but he rode magnificently. For a mile or more we kept in this order,
and then, as we galloped up a steep slope, my lighter weight brought me to the front.

I passed them both, and when I reached the crown I was riding level with the little, hard-faced
English huntsman.

In front of us were the dogs, and then, a hundred paces beyond them, was a brown wisp of a
thing, the fox itself, stretched to the uttermost. The sight of him fired my blood. "Aha, we
have you then, assassin!" I cried, and shouted my encouragement to the huntsman. I waved my
hand to show him that there was one upon whom he could rely.

And now there were only the dogs between me and my prey. These dogs, whose duty it is to point
out the game, were now rather a hindrance than a help to us, for it was hard to know how to
pass them. The huntsman felt the difficulty as much as I, for he rode behind them, and could
make no progress toward the fox. He was a swift rider, but wanting in enterprise. For my part,
I felt that it would be unworthy of the Hussars of Conflans if I could not overcome such a
difficulty as this.

Was Etienne Gerard to be stopped by a herd of fox-dogs?

It was absurd. I gave a shout and spurred my horse.

"Hold hard, sir! Hold hard!" cried the huntsman.

He was uneasy for me, this good old man, but I reassured him by a wave and a smile. The dogs
opened in front of me. One or two may have been hurt, but what would you have? The egg must
be broken for the omelette. I could hear the huntsman shouting his congratulations behind me.
One more effort, and the dogs were all behind me. Only the fox was in front.

Ah, the joy and pride of that moment! To know that I had beaten the English at their own sport.
Here were three hundred, all thirsting for the life of this animal, and yet it was I who was
about to take it. I thought of my comrades of the light cavalry brigade, of my mother, of the
Emperor, of France. I had brought honour to each and all. Every instant brought me nearer to
the fox. The moment for action had arrived, so I unsheathed my sabre. I waved it in the air,
and the brave English all shouted behind me.

Only then did I understand how difficult is this fox chase, for one may cut again and again
at the creature and never strike him once. He is small, and turns quickly from a blow. At every
cut I heard those shouts of encouragement from behind me, and they spurred me to yet another
effort. And then at last the supreme moment of my triumph arrived. In the very act of turning
I caught him fair with such another back-handed cut as that with which I killed the aide-de-camp
of the Emperor of Russia. He flew into two pieces, his head one way and his tail another. I
looked back and waved the blood-stained sabre in the air. For the moment I was exalted--superb!

Ah! how I should have loved to have waited to have received the congratulations of these generous
enemies.

There were fifty of them in sight, and not one who was not waving his hand and shouting. They
are not really such a phlegmatic race, the English. A gallant deed in war or in sport will
always warm their hearts. As to the old huntsman, he was the nearest to me, and I could see
with my own eyes how overcome he was by what he had seen. He was like a man paralysed, his
mouth open, his hand, with outspread fingers, raised in the air. For a moment my inclination
was to return and to embrace him.

But already the call of duty was sounding in my ears, and these English, in spite of all the
fraternity which exists among sportsmen, would certainly have made me prisoner. There was no
hope for my mission now, and I had done all that I could do. I could see the lines of Massena's
camp no very great distance off, for, by a lucky chance, the chase had taken us in that direction.

I turned from the dead fox, saluted with my sabre, and galloped away.

But they would not leave me so easily, these gallant huntsmen. I was the fox now, and the chase
swept bravely over the plain. It was only at the moment when I started for the camp that they
could have known that I was a Frenchman, and now the whole swarm of them were at my heels.
We were within gunshot of our pickets before they would halt, and then they stood in knots
and would not go away, but shouted and waved their hands at me. No, I will not think that it
was in enmity. Rather would I fancy that a glow of admiration filled their breasts, and that
their one desire was to embrace the stranger who had carried himself so gallantly and well.

IV. How the Brigadier Saved the Army

I have told you, my friends, how we held the English shut up for six months, from October,
1810, to March, 1811, within their lines of Torres Vedras. It was during this time that I hunted
the fox in their company, and showed them that amidst all their sportsmen there was not one
who could outride a Hussar of Conflans. When I galloped back into the French lines with the
blood of the creature still moist upon my blade the outposts who had seen what I had done raised
a frenzied cry in my honour, whilst these English hunters still yelled behind me, so that I
had the applause of both armies. It made the tears rise to my eyes to feel that I had won the
admiration of so many brave men. These English are generous foes. That very evening there came
a packet under a white flag addressed "To the Hussar officer who cut down the fox." Within,
I found the fox itself in two pieces, as I had left it. There was a note also, short but hearty,
as the English fashion is, to say that as I had slaughtered the fox it only remained for me
to eat it. They could not know that it was not our French custom to eat foxes, and it showed
their desire that he who had won the honours of the chase should also partake of the game.
It is not for a Frenchman to be outdone in politeness, and so I returned it to these brave
hunters, and begged them to accept it as a side-dish for their next dejeuner de la chasse.

It is thus that chivalrous opponents make war.

I had brought back with me from my ride a clear plan of the English lines, and this I laid
before Massena that very evening.

I had hoped that it would lead him to attack, but all the marshals were at each other's throats,
snapping and growling like so many hungry hounds. Ney hated Massena, and Massena hated Junot,
and Soult hated them all. For this reason, nothing was done. In the meantime food grew more
and more scarce, and our beautiful cavalry was ruined for want of fodder. With the end of the
winter we had swept the whole country bare, and nothing remained for us to eat, although we
sent our forage parties far and wide. It was clear even to the bravest of us that the time
had come to retreat. I was myself forced to admit it.

But retreat was not so easy. Not only were the troops weak and exhausted from want of supplies,
but the enemy had been much encouraged by our long inaction. Of Wellington we had no great
fear. We had found him to be brave and cautious, but with little enterprise. Besides, in that
barren country his pursuit could not be rapid.

But on our flanks and in our rear there had gathered great numbers of Portuguese militia, of
armed peasants, and of guerillas. These people had kept a safe distance all the winter, but
now that our horses were foundered they were as thick as flies all round our outposts, and
no man's life was worth a sou when once he fell into their hands. I could name a dozen officers
of my own acquaintance who were cut off during that time, and the luckiest was he who received
a ball from behind a rock through his head or his heart. There were some whose deaths were
so terrible that no report of them was ever allowed to reach their relatives. So frequent were
these tragedies, and so much did they impress the imagination of the men, that it became very
difficult to induce them to leave the camp.

There was one especial scoundrel, a guerilla chief named Manuelo, "The Smiler," whose exploits
filled our men with horror. He was a large, fat man of jovial aspect, and he lurked with a
fierce gang among the mountains which lay upon our left flank. A volume might be written of
this fellow's cruelties and brutalities, but he was certainly a man of power, for he organised
his brigands in a manner which made it almost impossible for us to get through his country.
This he did by imposing a severe discipline upon them and enforcing it by cruel penalties,
a policy by which he made them formidable, but which had some unexpected results, as I will
show you in my story. Had he not flogged his own lieutenant--but you will hear of that when
the time comes.

There were many difficulties in connection with a retreat, but it was very evident that there
was no other possible course, and so Massena began to quickly pass his baggage and his sick
from Torres Novas, which was his headquarters, to Coimbra, the first strong post on his line
of communications. He could not do this unperceived, however, and at once the guerillas came
swarming closer and closer upon our flanks. One of our divisions, that of Clausel, with a brigade
of Montbrun's cavalry, was far to the south of the Tagus, and it became very necessary to let
them know that we were about to retreat, for Otherwise they would be left unsupported in the
very heart of the enemy's country. I remember wondering how Massena would accomplish this,
for simple couriers could not get through, and small parties would be certainly destroyed.
In some way an order to fall back must be conveyed to these men, or France would be the weaker
by fourteen thousand men. The workforce are short mesomorphic, with hopes. Their peeper are mostly

 A less resolute man would have despaired. But in an instant
I saw and used the strange chance which Fortune had placed in my way. On the very edge of the
slope was one of the wine-barrels. I moved slowly toward it, and then with a tiger spring I
dived into it feet foremost, and with a roll of my body I tipped it over the side of the hill.

Shall I ever forget that dreadful journey--how I bounded and crashed and whizzed down that
terrible slope? I had dug in my knees and elbows, bunching my body into a compact bundle so
as to steady it; but my head projected from the end, and it was a marvel that I did not dash
out my brains. There were long, smooth slopes, and then came steeper scarps where the barrel
ceased to roll, and sprang into the air like a goat, coming down with a rattle and crash which
jarred every bone in my body. How the wind whistled in my ears, and my head turned and turned
until I was sick and giddy and nearly senseless! Then, with a swish and a great rasping and
crackling of branches, I reached the bushes which I had seen so far below me. Through them
I broke my way, down a slope beyond, and deep into another patch of underwood, where, striking
a sapling, my barrel flew to pieces. From amid a heap of staves and hoops I crawled out, my
body aching in every inch of it, but my heart singing loudly with joy and my spirit high within
me, for I knew how great was the feat which I had accomplished, and I already seemed to see
the beacon blazing on the hill.

A horrible nausea had seized me from the tossing which I had undergone, and I felt as I did
upon the ocean when first I experienced those movements of which the English have taken so
perfidious an advantage. I had to sit for a few moments with my head upon my hands beside the
ruins of my barrel. But there was no time for rest.

Already I heard shouts above me which told that my pursuers were descending the hill. I dashed
into the thickest part of the underwood, and I ran and ran until I was utterly exhausted. Then
I lay panting and listened with all my ears, but no sound came to them. I had shaken off my
enemies.

When I had recovered my breath I travelled swiftly on, and waded knee-deep through several
brooks, for it came into my head that they might follow me with dogs.

On gaining a clear place and looking round me, I found to my delight that in spite of my adventures
I had not been much out of my way. Above me towered the peak of Merodal, with its bare and
bold summit shooting out of the groves of dwarf oaks which shrouded its flanks.

These groves were the continuation of the cover under which I found myself, and it seemed to
me that I had nothing to fear now until I reached the other side of the forest. At the same
time I knew that every man's hand was against me, that I was unarmed, and that there were many
people about me. I saw no one, but several times I heard shrill whistles, and once the sound
of a gun in the distance.

It was hard work pushing one's way through the bushes, and so I was glad when I came to the
larger trees and found a path which led between them. Of course, I was too wise to walk upon
it, but I kept near it and followed its course. I had gone some distance, and had, as I imagined,
nearly reached the limit of the wood, when a strange, moaning sound fell upon my ears. At first
I thought it was the cry of some animal, but then there came words, of which I only caught
the French exclamation, "Mon Dieu!" With great caution I advanced in the direction from which
the sound proceeded, and this is what I saw.

On a couch of dried leaves there was stretched a man dressed in the same grey uniform which
I wore myself.

He was evidently horribly wounded, for he held a cloth to his breast which was crimson with
his blood. A pool had formed all round his couch, and he lay in a haze of flies, whose buzzing
and droning would certainly have called my attention if his groans had not come to my ear.

I lay for a moment, fearing some trap, and then, my pity and loyalty rising above all other
feelings, I ran forward and knelt by his side. He turned a haggard face upon me, and it was
Duplessis, the man who had gone before me. It needed but one glance at his sunken cheeks and
glazing eyes to tell me that he was dying.

"Gerard!" said he; "Gerard!"

I could but look my sympathy, but he, though the life was ebbing swiftly out of him, still
kept his duty before him, like the gallant gentleman he was.

"The beacon, Gerard! You will light it?"

"Have you flint and steel?"

"It is here!"

"Then I will light it to-night."

"I die happy to hear you say so. They shot me, Gerard. But you will tell the Marshal that I
did my best."

"And Cortex?"

"He was less fortunate. He fell into their hands and died horribly. If you see that you cannot
get away, Gerard, put a bullet into your own heart. Don't die as Cortex did."

I could see that his breath was failing, and I bent low to catch his words.

"Can you tell me anything which can help me in my task?" I asked.

"Yes, yes; de Pombal. He will help you. Trust de Pombal." With the words his head fell back
and he was dead.

"Trust de Pombal. It is good advice." To my amazement a man was standing at the very side of me.

So absorbed had I been in my comrade's words and intent on his advice that he had crept up
without my observing him. Now I sprang to my feet and faced him. He was a tall, dark fellow,
black-haired, black-eyed, black-bearded, with a long, sad face. In his hand he had a wine-bottle
and over his shoulder was slung one of the trabucos or blunderbusses which these fellows bear.
He made no effort to unsling it, and I understood that this was the man to whom my dead friend
had commended me.

"Alas, he is gone!" said he, bending over Duplessis.

"He fled into the wood after he was shot, but I was fortunate enough to find where he had fallen
and to make his last hours more easy. This couch was my making, and I had brought this wine
to slake his thirst."

"Sir," said I, "in the name of France I thank you. I am but a colonel of light cavalry, but
I am Etienne Gerard, and the name stands for something in the French army. May I ask----"

"Yes, sir, I am Aloysius de Pombal, younger brother of the famous nobleman of that name. At
present I am the first lieutenant in the band of the guerilla chief who is usually known as
Manuelo, 'The Smiler.'"

My word, I clapped my hand to the place where my pistol should have been, but the man only
smiled at the gesture.

"I am his first lieutenant, but I am also his deadly enemy," said he. He slipped off his jacket
and pulled up his shirt as he spoke. "Look at this!" he cried, and he turned upon me a back
which was all scored and lacerated with red and purple weals. "This is what 'The Smiler' has
done to me, a man with the noblest blood of Portugal in my veins. What I will do to 'The Smiler'
you have still to see."

There was such fury in his eyes and in the grin of his white teeth that I could no longer doubt
his truth, with that clotted and oozing back to corroborate his words.

"I have ten men sworn to stand by me," said he. "In a few days I hope to join your army, when
I have done my work here. In the meanwhile--" A strange change came over his face, and he suddenly
slung his musket to the front: "Hold up your hands, you French hound!" he yelled. "Up with
them, or I blow your head of!"

You start, my friends! You stare! Think, then, how I stared and started at this sudden ending
of our talk.

There was the black muzzle and there the dark, angry eyes behind it. What could I do? I was
helpless. I raised my hands in the air. At the same moment voices sounded from all parts of
the wood, there were crying and calling and rushing of many feet. A swarm of dreadful figures
broke through the green bushes, a dozen hands seized me, and I, poor, luckless, frenzied I,
was a prisoner once more. Thank God, there was no pistol which I could have plucked from my
belt and snapped at my own head. Had I been armed at that moment I should not be sitting here
in this cafe and telling you these old-world tales.

With grimy, hairy hands clutching me on every side I was led along the pathway through the
wood, the villain de Pombal giving directions to my Captors. Four of the brigands carried up
the dead body of Duplessis.

 Three sticks behind show the spot beyond which you may not
retreat. I can tell you that it is no game for children, and I will confess that, in spite
of my nine campaigns, I felt myself turn pale when first the ball flashed past me. So swift
was it that I had not time to raise my stick to ward it off, but by good fortune it missed
me and knocked down the wooden pins which marked the boundary. It was for Rudd then to defend
himself and for me to attack. When I was a boy in Gascony I learned to throw both far and straight,
so that I made sure that I could hit this gallant Englishman.

With a shout I rushed forward and hurled the ball at him. It flew as swift as a bullet toward
his ribs, but without a word he swung his staff and the ball rose a surprising distance in
the air. Lord Rufton clapped his hands and cheered. Again the ball was brought to me, and again
it was for me to throw. This time it flew past his head, and it seemed to me that it was his
turn to look pale.

But he was a brave man, this gardener, and again he faced me. Ah, my friends, the hour of my
triumph had come! It was a red waistcoat that he wore, and at this I hurled the ball. You would
have said that I was a gunner, not a hussar, for never was so straight an aim. With a despairing
cry--the cry of the brave man who is beaten--he fell upon the wooden pegs behind him, and they
all rolled upon the ground together. He was cruel, this English milord, and he laughed so that
he could not come to the aid of his servant. It was for me, the victor, to rush forward to
embrace this intrepid player, and to raise him to his feet with words of praise, and encouragement,
and hope. He was in pain and could not stand erect, yet the honest fellow confessed that there
was no accident in my victory. "He did it a-purpose! He did it a-purpose!"

Again and again he said it. Yes, it is a great game this cricket, and I would gladly have ventured
upon it again but Lord Rufton and Rudd said that it was late in the season, and so they would
play no more.

How foolish of me, the old, broken man, to dwell upon these successes, and yet I will confess
that my age has been very much soothed and comforted by the memory of the women who have loved
me and the men whom I have overcome. It is pleasant to think that five years afterward, when
Lord Rufton came to Paris after the peace, he was able to assure me that my name was still
a famous one in the north of Devonshire for the fine exploits that I had performed. Especially,
he said, they still talked over my boxing match with the Honourable Baldock. It came about
in this way. Of an evening many sportsmen would assemble at the house of Lord Rufton, where
they would drink much wine, make wild bets, and talk of their horses and their foxes. How well
I remember those strange creatures. Sir Barrington, Jack Lupton, of Barnstable, Colonel Addison,
Johnny Miller, Lord Sadler, and my enemy, the Honourable Baldock. They were of the same stamp
all of them, drinkers, madcaps, fighters, gamblers, full of strange caprices and extraordinary
whims. Yet they were kindly fellows in their rough fashion, save only this Baldock, a fat man,
who prided himself on his skill at the box-fight. It was he who, by his laughter against the
French because they were ignorant of sport, caused me to challenge him in the very sport at
which he excelled. You will say that it was foolish, my friends, but the decanter had passed
many times, and the blood of youth ran hot in my veins. I would fight him, this boaster; I
would show him that if we had not skill at least we had courage. Lord Rufton would not allow
it. I insisted. The others cheered me on and slapped me on the back. "No, dash it, Baldock,
he's our guest," said Rufton. "It's his own doing," the other answered. "Look here, Rufton,
they can't hurt each other if they wear the mawleys," cried Lord Sadler. And so it was agreed.

What the mawleys were I did not know, but presently they brought out four great puddings of
leather, not unlike a fencing glove, but larger. With these our hands were covered after we
had stripped ourselves of our coats and our waistcoats. Then the table, with the glasses and
decanters, was pushed into the corner of the room, and behold us; face to face! Lord Sadler
sat in the arm-chair with a watch in his open hand. "Time!" said he.

I will confess to you, my friends, that I felt at that moment a tremor such as none of my many
duels have ever given me. With sword or pistol I am at home, but here I only understood that
I must struggle with this fat Englishman and do what I could, in spite of these great puddings
upon my hands, to overcome him. And at the very outset I was disarmed of the best weapon that
was left to me. "Mind, Gerard, no kicking!" said Lord Rufton in my ear. I had only a pair of
thin dancing slippers, and yet the man was fat, and a few well-directed kicks might have left
me the victor. But there is an etiquette just as there is in fencing, and I refrained. I looked
at this Englishman and I wondered how I should attack him. His ears were large and prominent.
Could I seize them I might drag him to the ground. I rushed in, but I was betrayed by this
flabby glove, and twice I lost my hold. He struck me, but I cared little for his blows, and
again I seized him by the ear. He fell, and I rolled upon him and thumped his head upon the ground.

How they cheered and laughed, these gallant Englishmen, and how they clapped me on the back!

"Even money on the Frenchman," cried Lord Sadler.

"He fights foul," cried my enemy, rubbing his crimson ears. "He savaged me on the ground."

"You must take your chance of that," said Lord Rufton, coldly.

"Time!" cried Lord Sadler, and once again we advanced to the assault.

He was flushed, and his small eyes were as vicious as those of a bull-dog. There was hatred
on his face. For my part I carried myself lightly and gaily. A French gentleman fights but
he does not hate. I drew myself up before him, and I bowed as I have done in the duello.

There can be grace and courtesy as well as defiance in a bow; I put all three into this one,
with a touch of ridicule in the shrug which accompanied it. It was at this moment that he struck
me. The room spun round me. I fell upon my back. But in an instant I was on my feet again and
had rushed to a close combat. His ear, his hair, his nose, I seized them each in turn. Once
again the mad joy of the battle was in my veins. The old cry of triumph rose to my lips. "Vive
l'Empereur!" I yelled as I drove my head into his stomach. He threw his arm round my neck,
and holding me with one hand he struck me with the other. I buried my teeth in his arm, and
he shouted with pain. "Call him off, Rufton!" he screamed.

"Call him off, man! He's worrying me!" They dragged me away from him. Can I ever forget it?--the
laughter, the cheering, the congratulations! Even my enemy bore me no ill-will, for he shook
me by the hand. For my part I embraced him on each cheek. Five years afterward I learned from
Lord Rufton that my noble bearing upon that evening was still fresh in the memory of my English
friends.

It is not, however, of my own exploits in sport that I wish to speak to you to-night, but it
is of the Lady Jane Dacre and the strange adventure of which she was the cause. Lady Jane Dacre
was Lord Rufton's sister and the lady of his household. I fear that until I came it was lonely
for her, since she was a beautiful and refined woman with nothing in common with those who
were about her. Indeed, this might be said of many women in the England of those days, for
the men were rude and rough and coarse, with boorish habits and few accomplishments, while
the women were the most lovely and tender that I have ever known. We became great friends,
the Lady Jane and I, for it was not possible for me to drink three bottles of port after dinner
like those Devonshire gentlemen, and so I would seek refuge in her drawing-room, where evening
after evening she would play the harpsichord and I would sing the songs of my own land. Xxii the dacre Grouping in the ISLANDS want for concatenation and

VI. How the Brigadier Rode to Minsk

I would have a stronger wine to-night, my friends, a wine of Burgundy rather than of Bordeaux.
It is that my heart, my old soldier heart, is heavy within me. It is a strange thing, this
age which creeps upon one. One does not know, one does not understand; the spirit is ever the
same, and one does not remember how the poor body crumbles. But there comes a moment when it
is brought home, when quick as the sparkle of a whirling sabre it is clear to us, and we see
the men we were and the men we are. Yes, yes, it was so to-day, and I would have a wine of
Burgundy to-night. White Burgundy--Montrachet--Sir, I am your debtor!

It was this morning in the Champ de Mars. Your pardon, friends, while an old man tells his
trouble. You saw the review. Was it not splendid? I was in the enclosure for veteran officers
who have been decorated.

This ribbon on my breast was my passport. The cross itself I keep at home in a leathern pouch.
They did us honour, for we were placed at the saluting point, with the Emperor and the carriages
of the Court upon our right.

It is years since I have been to a review, for I cannot approve of many things which I have
seen. I do not approve of the red breeches of the infantry. It was in white breeches that the
infantry used to fight. Red is for the cavalry. A little more, and they would ask our busbies
and our spurs! Had I been seen at a review they might well have said that I, Etienne Gerard,
had condoned it. So I have stayed at home. But this war of the Crimea is different. The men
go to battle.

It is not for me to be absent when brave men gather.

My faith, they march well, those little infantrymen!

They are not large, but they are very solid and they carry themselves well. I took off my hat
to them as they passed. Then there came the guns. They were good guns, well horsed and well
manned. I took off my hat to them. Then came the Engineers, and to them also I took off my
hat. There are no braver men than the Engineers. Then came the cavalry, Lancers, Cuirassiers,
Chasseurs, and Spahis. To all of them in turn I was able to take off my hat, save only to the
Spahis.

The Emperor had no Spahis. But when all of the others had passed, what think you came at the
close? A brigade of Hussars, and at the charge!

Oh, my friends, the pride and the glory and the beauty, the flash and the sparkle, the roar
of the hoofs and the jingle of chains, the tossing manes, the noble heads, the rolling cloud,
and the dancing waves of steel! My heart drummed to them as they passed. And the last of all,
was it not my own old regiment? My eyes fell upon the grey and silver dolmans, with the leopard-skin
shabraques, and at that instant the years fell away from me and I saw my own beautiful men
and horses, even as they had swept behind their young colonel, in the pride of our youth and
our strength, just forty years ago. Up flew my cane. "Chargez! En avant! Vive l'Empereur!"

It was the past calling to the present. But oh, what a thin, piping voice! Was this the voice
that had once thundered from wing to wing of a strong brigade? And the arm that could scarce
wave a cane, were these the muscles of fire and steel which had no match in all Napoleon's
mighty host? They smiled at me. They cheered me. The Emperor laughed and bowed. But to me the
present was a dim dream, and what was real were my eight hundred dead Hussars and the Etienne
of long ago.

Enough--a brave man can face age and fate as he faced Cossacks and Uhlans. But there are times
when Montrachet is better than the wine of Bordeaux.

It is to Russia that they go, and so I will tell you a story of Russia. Ah, what an evil dream
of the night it seems! Blood and ice. Ice and blood. Fierce faces with snow upon the whiskers.
Blue hands held out for succour. And across the great white plain the one long black line of
moving figures, trudging, trudging, a hundred miles, another hundred, and still always the
same white plain. Sometimes there were fir-woods to limit it, sometimes it stretched away to
the cold blue sky, but the black line stumbled on and on. Those weary, ragged, starving men,
the spirit frozen out of them, looked neither to right nor left, but with sunken faces and
rounded backs trailed onward and ever onward, making for France as wounded beasts make for
their lair. There was no speaking, and you could scarce hear the shuffle of feet in the snow.
Once only I heard them laugh. It was outside Wilna, when an aide-de-camp rode up to the head
of that dreadful column and asked if that were the Grand Army. All who were within hearing
looked round, and when they saw those broken men, those ruined regiments, those fur-capped
skeletons who were once the Guard, they laughed, and the laugh crackled down the column like
a feu de joie. I have heard many a groan and cry and scream in my life, but nothing so terrible
as the laugh of the Grand Army.

But why was it that these helpless men were not destroyed by the Russians? Why was it that
they were not speared by the Cossacks or herded into droves, and driven as prisoners into the
heart of Russia? On every side as you watched the black snake winding over the snow you saw
also dark, moving shadows which came and went like cloud drifts on either flank and behind.
They were the Cossacks, who hung round us like wolves round the flock.

But the reason why they did not ride in upon us was that all the ice of Russia could not cool
the hot hearts of some of our soldiers. To the end there were always those who were ready to
throw themselves between these savages and their prey. One man above all rose greater as the
danger thickened, and won a higher name amid disaster than he had done when he led our van
to victory. To him I drink this glass--to Ney, the red-maned Lion, glaring back over his shoulder
at the enemy who feared to tread too closely on his heels. I can see him now, his broad white
face convulsed with fury, his light blue eyes sparkling like flints, his great voice roaring
and crashing amid the roll of the musketry. His glazed and featherless cocked hat was the ensign
upon which France rallied during those dreadful days.

It is well known that neither I nor the regiment of Hussars of Conflans were at Moscow. We
were left behind on the lines of communication at Borodino. How the Emperor could have advanced
without us is incomprehensible to me, and, indeed, it was only then that I understood that
his judgment was weakening and that he was no longer the man that he had been. However, a soldier
has to obey orders, and so I remained at this village, which was poisoned by the bodies of
thirty thousand men who had lost their lives in the great battle. I spent the late autumn in
getting my horses into condition and reclothing my men, so that when the army fell back on
Borodino my Hussars were the best of the cavalry, and were placed under Ney in the rear-guard.

What could he have done without us during those dreadful days? "Ah, Gerard," said he one evening--but
it is not for me to repeat the words. Suffice it that he spoke what the whole army felt. The
rear-guard covered the army and the Hussars of Conflans covered the rear-guard. There was the
whole truth in a sentence.

Always the Cossacks were on us. Always we held them off. Never a day passed that we had not
to wipe our sabres. That was soldiering indeed.

But there came a time between Wilna and Smolensk when the situation became impossible. Cossacks
and even cold we could fight, but we could not fight hunger as well. Food must be got at all
costs. That night Ney sent for me to the waggon in which he slept. His great head was sunk
on his hands. Mind and body he was wearied to death.

"Colonel Gerard," said he, "things are going very badly with us. The men are starving. We must
have food at all costs."

"The horses," I suggested.

"Save your handful of cavalry; there are none left."

"The band," said I.

He laughed, even in his despair.

"Why the band?" he asked.

"Fighting men are of value."

"Good," said he. "You would play the game down to the last card and so would I. Good, Gerard,
good!"

He clasped my hand in his. "But there is one chance for us yet, Gerard." He unhooked a lantern
from the roof of the waggon and he laid it on a map which was stretched before him. "To the
south of us," said he, "there lies the town of Minsk. I have word from a Russian deserter that
much corn has been stored in the town-hall. I wish you to take as many men as you think best,
set forth for Minsk, seize the corn, load any carts which you may collect in the town, and
bring them to me between here and Smolensk. If you fail it is but a detachment cut off. If
you succeed it is new life to the army."

He had not expressed himself well, for it was evident that if we failed it was not merely the
loss of a detachment. It is quality as well as quantity which counts.

And yet how honourable a mission and how glorious a risk! If mortal men could bring it, then
the corn should come from Minsk. I said so, and spoke a few burning words about a brave man's
duty until the Marshal was so moved that he rose and, taking me affectionately by the shoulders,
pushed me out of the waggon.

It was clear to me that in order to succeed in my enterprise I should take a small force and
depend rather upon surprise than upon numbers. A large body could not conceal itself, would
have great difficulty in getting food, and would cause all the Russians around us to concentrate
for its certain destruction. On the other hand, if a small body of cavalry could get past the
Cossacks unseen it was probable that they would find no troops to oppose them, for we knew
that the main Russian army was several days' march behind us. This corn was meant, no doubt,
for their consumption. A squadron of Hussars and thirty Polish Lancers were all whom I chose
for the venture. That very night we rode out of the camp, and struck south in the direction
of Minsk.

Fortunately there was but a half moon, and we were able to pass without being attacked by the
enemy. Twice we saw great fires burning amid the snow, and around them a thick bristle of long
poles. These were the lances of Cossacks, which they had stood upright while they slept. It
would have been a great joy to us to have charged in amongst them, for we had much to revenge,
and the eyes of my comrades looked longingly from me to those red flickering patches in the
darkness. My faith, I was sorely tempted to do it, for it would have been a good lesson to
teach them that they must keep a few miles between themselves and a French army. It is the
essence of good generalship, however, to keep one thing before one at a time, and so we rode
silently on through the snow, leaving these Cossack bivouacs to right and left. Behind us the
black sky was all mottled with a line of flame which showed where our own poor wretches were
trying to keep themselves alive for another day of misery and starvation.

All night we rode slowly onward, keeping our horses' tails to the Pole Star. There were many
tracks in the snow, and we kept to the line of these, that no one might remark that a body
of cavalry had passed that way.

These are the little precautions which mark the experienced officer. Besides, by keeping to
the tracks we were most likely to find the villages, and only in the villages could we hope
to get food. The dawn of day found us in a thick fir-wood, the trees so loaded with snow that
the light could hardly reach us. When we had found our way out of it it was full daylight,
the rim of the rising sun peeping over the edge of the great snow-plain and turning it crimson
from end to end. I halted my Hussars and Lancers under the shadow of the wood, and I studied
the country. Close to us there was a small farm-house. Beyond, at the distance of several miles,
was a village. Far away on the sky-line rose a considerable town all bristling with church
towers. This must be Minsk. In no direction could I see any signs of troops. It was evident
that we had passed through the Cossacks and that there was nothing between us and our goal.
A joyous shout burst from my men when I told them our position, and we advanced rapidly toward
the village.

I have said, however, that there was a small farm-house immediately in front of us. As we rode
up to it I observed that a fine grey horse with a military saddle was tethered by the door.
Instantly I galloped forward, but before I could reach it a man dashed out of the door, flung
himself on to the horse, and rode furiously away, the crisp, dry snow flying up in a cloud
behind him. The sunlight gleamed upon his gold epaulettes, and I knew that he was a Russian
officer. He would raise the whole country-side if we did not catch him. I put spurs to Violette
and flew after him. My troopers followed; but there was no horse among them to compare with
Violette, and I knew well that if I could not catch the Russian I need expect no help from them.

But it is a swift horse indeed and a skilful rider who can hope to escape from Violette with
Etienne Gerard in the saddle. He rode well, this young Russian, and his mount was a good one,
but gradually we wore him down.

His face glanced continually over his shoulder--dark, handsome face, with eyes like an eagle--and
I saw as I closed with him that he was measuring the distance between us. Suddenly he half
turned; there were a flash and a crack as his pistol bullet hummed past my ear.

Before he could draw his sword I was upon him; but he still spurred his horse, and the two
galloped together over the plain, I with my leg against the Russian's and my left hand upon
his right shoulder. I saw his hand fly up to his mouth. Instantly I dragged him across my pommel
and seized him by the throat, so that he could not swallow. His horse shot from under him,
but I held him fast and Violette came to a stand. Sergeant Oudin of the Hussars was the first
to join us. He was an old soldier, and he saw at a glance what I was after.

"Hold tight, Colonel," said he, "I'll do the rest."

He slipped out his knife, thrust the blade between the clenched teeth of the Russian, and turned
it so as to force his mouth open. There, on his tongue, was the little wad of wet paper which
he had been so anxious to swallow. Oudin picked it out and I let go of the man's throat. From
the way in which, half strangled as he was, he glanced at the paper I was sure that it was
a message of extreme importance. His hands twitched as if he longed to snatch it from me. He
shrugged his shoulders, however, and smiled good-humouredly when I apologised for my roughness.

"And now to business," said I, when he had done coughing and hawking. "What is your name?"

"Alexis Barakoff."

"Your rank and regiment?"

"Captain of the Dragoons of Grodno."

"What is this note which you were carrying?"

"It is a line which I had written to my sweetheart."

"Whose name," said I, examining the address, "is the Hetman Platoff. Come, come, sir, this
is an important military document, which you are carrying from one general to another. Tell
me this instant what it is."

"Read it and then you will know." He spoke perfect French, as do most of the educated Russians.
But he knew well that there is not one French officer in a thousand who knows a word of Russian.
The inside of the note contained one single line, which ran like this:--

"Pustj Franzuzy pridutt v Minsk. Min gotovy."

I stared at it, and I had to shake my head. Then I showed it to my Hussars, but they could
make nothing of it. The Poles were all rough fellows who could not read or write, save only
the sergeant, who came from Memel, in East Prussia, and knew no Russian. It was maddening,
for I felt that I had possession of some important secret upon which the safety of the army
might depend, and yet I could make no sense of it. Again I entreated our prisoner to translate
it, and offered him his freedom if he would do so. He only smiled at my request.

I could not but admire him, for it was the very smile which I should have myself smiled had
I been in his position.

"At least," said I, "tell us the name of this village."

"It is Dobrova."

"And that is Minsk over yonder, I suppose."

"Yes, that is Minsk."

"Then we shall go to the village and we shall very soon find some one who will translate this
despatch."

So we rode onward together, a trooper with his carbine unslung on either side of our prisoner.
The village was but a little place, and I set a guard at the ends of the single street, so
that no one could escape from it. It was necessary to call a halt and to find some food for
the men and horses, since they had travelled all night and had a long journey still before them.

There was one large stone house in the centre of the village, and to this I rode. It was the
house of the priest--a snuffy and ill-favoured old man who had not a civil answer to any of
our questions. An uglier fellow I never met, but, my faith, it was very different with his
only daughter, who kept house for him. She was a brunette, a rare thing in Russia, with creamy
skin, raven hair, and a pair of the most glorious dark eyes that ever kindled at the sight
of a Hussar. From the first glance I saw that she was mine. It was no time for love-making
when a soldier's duty had to be done, but still, as I took the simple meal which they laid
before me, I chatted lightly with the lady, and we were the best of friends before an hour
had passed. Sophie was her first name, her second I never knew. I taught her to call me Etienne,
and I tried to cheer her up, for her sweet face was sad and there were tears in her beautiful
dark eyes. I pressed her to tell me what it was which was grieving her.

"How can I be otherwise," said she, speaking French with a most adorable lisp, "when one of
my poor countrymen is a prisoner in your hands? I saw him between two of your Hussars as you
rode into the village."

"It is the fortune of war," said I. "His turn to-day; mine, perhaps, to-morrow."

"But consider, Monsieur--" said she.

"Etienne," said I.

"Oh, Monsieur----"

"Etienne," said I.

"Well, then," she cried, beautifully flushed and desperate, "consider, Etienne, that this young
officer will be taken back to your army and will be starved or frozen, for if, as I hear, your
own soldiers have a hard march, what will be the lot of a prisoner?"

I shrugged my shoulders.

"You have a kind face, Etienne," said she; "you would not condemn this poor man to certain
death. I entreat you to let him go."

Her delicate hand rested upon my sleeve, her dark eyes looked imploringly into mine.

A sudden thought passed through my mind. I would grant her request, but I would demand a favour
in return.

At my order the prisoner was brought up into the room.

"Captain Barakoff," said I, "this young lady has begged me to release you, and I am inclined
to do so. I would ask you to give your parole that you will remain in this dwelling for twenty-four
hours, and take no steps to inform anyone of our movements."

"I will do so," said he.

"Then I trust in your honour. One man more or less can make no difference in a struggle between
great armies, and to take you back as a prisoner would be to condemn you to death. Depart,
sir, and show your gratitude not to me, but to the first French officer who falls into your hands."

When he was gone I drew my paper from my pocket.

"Now, Sophie," said I, "I have done what you asked me, and all that I ask in return is that
you will give me a lesson in Russian."

"With all my heart," said she.

"Let us begin on this," said I, spreading out the paper before her. "Let us take it word for
word and see what it means."

She looked at the writing with some surprise. "It means," said she, "if the French come to
Minsk all is lost." Suddenly a look of consternation passed over her beautiful face. "Great
Heavens!" she cried, "what is it that I have done? I have betrayed my country! Oh, Etienne,
your eyes are the last for whom this message is meant. How could you be so cunning as to make
a poor, simple-minded, and unsuspecting girl betray the cause of her country?"

I consoled my poor Sophie as best I might, and I assured her that it was no reproach to her
that she should be outwitted by so old a campaigner and so shrewd a man as myself. But it was
no time now for talk. This message made it clear that the corn was indeed at Minsk, and that
there were no troops there to defend it. I gave a hurried order from the window, the trumpeter
blew the assembly, and in ten minutes we had left the village behind us and were riding hard
for the city, the gilded domes and minarets of which glimmered above the snow of the horizon.
Higher they rose and higher, until at last, as the sun sank toward the west, we were in the
broad main street, and galloped up it amid the shouts of the moujiks and the cries of frightened
women until we found ourselves in front of the great town-hall. My cavalry I drew up in the
square, and I, with my two sergeants, Oudin and Papilette, rushed into the building.

Heavens! shall I ever forget the sight which greeted us? Right in front of us was drawn up
a triple line of Russian Grenadiers. Their muskets rose as we entered, and a crashing volley
burst into our very faces. Oudin and Papilette dropped upon the floor, riddled with bullets.

 Behind those fagots is an unguarded door. Here is the key to it. Go forth, Colonel
Gerard, and I trust that we may never look upon each other's faces again."

I stood for an instant with the key in my hand and my head in a whirl. Then I handed it back
to her.

"I cannot do it," I said.

"Why not?"

"I have given my parole."

"To whom?" she asked.

"Why, to you."

"And I release you from it."

My heart bounded with joy. Of course, it was true what she said. I had refused to give my parole
to Sergine. I owed him no duty. If she relieved me from my promise my honour was clear. I took
the key from her hand.

"You will find Captain Barakoff at the end of the village street," said she. "We of the North
never forget either an injury or a kindness. He has your mare and your sword waiting for you.
Do not delay an instant, for in two hours it will be dawn."

So I passed out into the star-lit Russian night, and had that last glimpse of Sophie as she
peered after me through the open door. She looked wistfully at me as if she expected something
more than the cold thanks which I gave her, but even the humblest man has his pride, and I
will not deny that mine was hurt by the deception which she had played upon me. I could not
have brought myself to kiss her hand, far less her lips. The door led into a narrow alley,
and at the end of it stood a muffled figure, who held Violette by the bridle.

"You told me to be kind to the next French officer whom I found in distress," said he. "Good
luck! Bon voyage!" he whispered, as I bounded into the saddle.

"Remember, 'Poltava' is the watchword."

It was well that he had given it to me, for twice I had to pass Cossack pickets before I was
clear of the lines.

I had just ridden past the last vedettes and hoped that I was a free man again, when there
was a soft thudding in the snow behind me, and a heavy man upon a great black horse came swiftly
after me. My first impulse was to put spurs to Violette. My second, as I saw a long black beard
against a steel cuirass, was to halt and await him.

"I thought that it was you, you dog of a Frenchman," he cried, shaking his drawn sword at me.
"So you have broken your parole, you rascal!"

"I gave no parole."

"You lie, you hound!"

I looked around and no one was coming. The vedettes were motionless and distant. We were all
alone, with the moon above and the snow beneath. Fortune has ever been my friend.

"I gave you no parole."

"You gave it to the lady."

"Then I will answer for it to the lady."

"That would suit you better, no doubt. But, unfortunately, you will have to answer for it to me."

"I am ready."

"Your sword, too! There is treason in this! Ah, I see it all! The woman has helped you. She
shall see Siberia for this night's work."

The words were his death-warrant. For Sophie's sake I could not let him go back alive. Our
blades crossed, and an instant later mine was through his black beard and deep in his throat.
I was on the ground almost as soon as he, but the one thrust was enough. He died, snapping
his teeth at my ankles like a savage wolf.

Two days later I had rejoined the army at Smolensk, and was a part once more of that dreary
procession which tramped onward through the snow, leaving a long weal of blood to show the
path which it had taken.

Enough, my friends; I would not re-awaken the memory of those days of misery and death. They
still come to haunt me in my dreams. When we halted at last in Warsaw we had left behind us
our guns, our transport, and three-fourths of our comrades. But we did not leave behind us
the honour of Etienne Gerard. They have said that I broke my parole. Let them beware how they
say it to my face, for the story is as I tell it, and old as I am my forefinger is not too
weak to press a trigger when my honour is in question.

VII. How the Brigadier Bore Himself at Waterloo

I. THE STORY OF THE FOREST INN

Of all the great battles in which I had the honour of drawing my sword for the Emperor and
for France there was not one which was lost. At Waterloo, although, in a sense, I was present,
I was unable to fight, and the enemy was victorious. It is not for me to say that there is
a connection between these two things. You know me too well, my friends, to imagine that I
would make such a claim. But it gives matter for thought, and some have drawn flattering conclusions
from it.

After all, it was only a matter of breaking a few English squares and the day would have been
our own. If the Hussars of Conflans, with Etienne Gerard to lead them, could not do this, then
the best judges are mistaken.

But let that pass. The Fates had ordained that I should hold my hand and that the Empire should
fall. But they had also ordained that this day of gloom and sorrow should bring such honour
to me as had never come when I swept on the wings of victory from Boulogne to Vienna.

Never had I burned so brilliantly as at that supreme moment when the darkness fell upon all
around me. You are aware that I was faithful to the Emperor in his adversity, and that I refused
to sell my sword and my honour to the Bourbons. Never again was I to feel my war horse between
my knees, never again to hear the kettledrums and silver trumpets behind me as I rode in front
of my little rascals. But it comforts my heart, my friends, and it brings the tears to my eyes,
to think how great I was upon that last day of my soldier life, and to remember that of all
the remarkable exploits which have won me the love of so many beautiful women, and the respect
of so many noble men, there was none which, in splendour, in audacity, and in the great end
which was attained, could compare with my famous ride upon the night of June 18th, 1815. I
am aware that the story is often told at mess-tables and in barrack-rooms, so that there are
few in the army who have not heard it, but modesty has sealed my lips, until now, my friends,
in the privacy of these intimate gatherings, I am inclined to lay the true facts before you.

In the first place, there is one thing which I can assure you. In all his career Napoleon never
had so splendid an army as that with which he took the field for that campaign. In 1813 France
was exhausted. For every veteran there were five children--Marie Louises, as we called them;
for the Empress had busied herself in raising levies while the Emperor took the field. But
it was very different in 1815. The prisoners had all come back--the men from the snows of Russia,
the men from the dungeons of Spain, the men from the hulks in England.

These were the dangerous men, veterans of twenty battles, longing for their old trade, and
with hearts filled with hatred and revenge. The ranks were full of soldiers who wore two and
three chevrons, every chevron meaning five years' service. And the spirit of these men was
terrible. They were raging, furious, fanatical, adoring the Emperor as a Mameluke does his
prophet, ready to fall upon their own bayonets if their blood could serve him. If you had seen
these fierce old veterans going into battle, with their flushed faces, their savage eyes, their
furious yells, you would wonder that anything could stand against them. So high was the spirit
of France at that time that every other spirit would have quailed before it; but these people,
these English, had neither spirit nor soul, but only solid, immovable beef, against which we
broke ourselves in vain. That was it, my friends! On the one side, poetry, gallantry, self-sacrifice--all
that is beautiful and heroic. On the other side, beef. Our hopes, our ideals, our dreams--all
were shattered on that terrible beef of Old England.

You have read how the Emperor gathered his forces, and then how he and I, with a hundred and
thirty thousand veterans, hurried to the northern frontier and fell upon the Prussians and
the English. On the 16th of June, Ney held the English in play at Quatre-Bras while we beat
the Prussians at Ligny. It is not for me to say how far I contributed to that victory, but
it is well known that the Hussars of Conflans covered themselves with glory. They fought well,
these Prussians, and eight thousand of them were left upon the field. The Emperor thought that
he had done with them, as he sent Marshal Grouchy with thirty-two thousand men to follow them
up and to prevent their interfering with his plans. Then with nearly eighty thousand men, he
turned upon these "Goddam" Englishmen. How much we had to avenge upon them, we Frenchmen--the
guineas of Pitt, the hulks of Portsmouth, the invasion of Wellington, the perfidious victories
of Nelson! At last the day of punishment seemed to have arisen.

Wellington had with him sixty-seven thousand men, but many of them were known to be Dutch and
Belgian, who had no great desire to fight against us. Of good troops he had not fifty thousand.
Finding himself in the presence of the Emperor in person with eighty thousand men, this Englishman
was so paralysed with fear that he could neither move himself nor his army. You have seen the
rabbit when the snake approaches. So stood the English upon the ridge of Waterloo. The night
before, the Emperor, who had lost an aide-de-camp at Ligny, ordered me to join his staff, and
I had left my Hussars to the charge of Major Victor. I know not which of us was the most grieved,
they or I, that I should be called away upon the eve of battle, but an order is an order, and
a good soldier can but shrug his shoulders and obey. With the Emperor I rode across the front
of the enemy's position on the morning of the 18th, he looking at them through his glass and
planning which was the shortest way to destroy them. Soult was at his elbow, and Ney and Foy
and others who had fought the English in Portugal and Spain. "Have a care, Sire," said Soult.
"The English infantry is very solid."

"You think them good soldiers because they have beaten you," said the Emperor, and we younger
men turned away our faces and smiled. But Ney and Foy were grave and serious. All the time
the English line, chequered with red and blue and dotted with batteries, was drawn up silent
and watchful within a long musket-shot of us. On the other side of the shallow valley our own
people, having finished their soup, were assembling for the battle. It had rained very heavily,
but at this moment the sun shone out and beat upon the French army, turning our brigades of
cavalry into so many dazzling rivers of steel, and twinkling and sparkling on the innumerable
bayonets of the infantry. At the sight of that splendid army, and the beauty and majesty of
its appearance, I could contain myself no longer, but, rising in my stirrups, I waved my busby
and cried, "Vive l'Empereur!" a shout which growled and roared and clattered from one end of
the line to the other, while the horsemen waved their swords and the footmen held up their
shakos upon their bayonets. The English remained petrified upon their ridge. They knew that
their hour had come.

And so it would have come if at that moment the word had been given and the whole army had
been permitted to advance. We had but to fall upon them and to sweep them from the face of
the earth. To put aside all question of courage, we were the more numerous, the older soldiers,
and the better led. But the Emperor desired to do all things in order, and he waited until
the ground should be drier and harder, so that his artillery could manoeuvre. So three hours
were wasted, and it was eleven o'clock before we saw Jerome Buonaparte's columns advance upon
our left and heard the crash of the guns which told that the battle had begun. The doubt lines may

 Do you understand me?"

Again the Dragoon inclined his head. This silence impressed me. I felt that he was indeed a
dangerous man.

"Then I leave the details in your own hands. Strike at no one except the highest. You cannot
mistake the Imperial carriage, nor can you fail to recognise the figure of the Emperor. Now
I must follow the Marshal. Adieu! If ever I see you again I trust that it will be to congratulate
you upon a deed which will ring through Europe."

The Dragoon saluted and Gneisenau hurried from the room. The young officer stood in deep thought
for a few moments. Then he followed the Chief of the Staff.

I looked with curiosity from my loophole to see what his next proceeding would be. His horse,
a fine, strong chestnut with two white stockings, was fastened to the rail of the inn. He sprang
into the saddle, and, riding to intercept a column of cavalry which was passing, he spoke to
an officer at the head of the leading regiment.

Presently after some talk I saw two Hussars--it was a Hussar regiment--drop out of the ranks
and take up their position beside Count Stein. The next regiment was also stopped, and two
Lancers were added to his escort. The next furnished him with two Dragoons and the next with
two Cuirassiers. Then he drew his little group of horsemen aside and he gathered them round
him, explaining to them what they had to do. Finally the nine soldiers rode off together and
disappeared into the Wood of Paris.

I need not tell you, my friends, what all this portended.

Indeed, he had acted exactly as I should have done in his place. From each colonel he had demanded
the two best horsemen in the regiment, and so he had assembled a band who might expect to catch
whatever they should follow. Heaven help the Emperor if, without an escort, he should find
them on his track!

And I, dear friends--imagine the fever, the ferment, the madness of my mind! All thought of
Grouchy had passed away. No guns were to be heard to the east. He could not be near. If he
should come up he would not now be in time to alter the event of the day. The sun was already
low in the sky and there could not be more than two or three hours of daylight. My mission
might be dismissed as useless. But here was another mission, more pressing, more immediate,
a mission which meant the safety, and perhaps the life, of the Emperor. At all costs, through
every danger, I must get back to his side.

But how was I to do it? The whole Prussian army was now between me and the French lines. They
blocked every road, but they could not block the path of duty when Etienne Gerard sees it lie
before him. I could not wait longer. I must be gone.

There was but the one opening to the loft, and so it was only down the ladder that I could
descend. I looked into the kitchen and I found that the young surgeon was still there. In a
chair sat the wounded English aide-de-camp, and on the straw lay two Prussian soldiers in the
last stage of exhaustion. The others had all recovered and been sent on. These were my enemies,
and I must pass through them in order to gain my horse. From the surgeon I had nothing to fear;
the Englishman was wounded, and his sword stood with his cloak in a corner; the two Germans
were half insensible, and their muskets were not beside them. What could be simpler? I opened
the trap-door, slipped down the ladder, and appeared in the midst of them, my sword drawn in
my hand.

What a picture of surprise! The surgeon, of course, knew all, but to the Englishman and the
two Germans it must have seemed that the god of war in person had descended from the skies.
With my appearance, with my figure, with my silver and grey uniform, and with that gleaming
sword in my hand, I must indeed have been a sight worth seeing. The two Germans lay petrified
with staring eyes. The English officer half rose, but sat down again from weakness, his mouth
open and his hand on the back of his chair.

"What the deuce!" he kept on repeating, "what the deuce!"

"Pray do not move," said I; "I will hurt no one, but woe to the man who lays hands upon me
to stop me. You have nothing to fear if you leave me alone, and nothing to hope if you try
to hinder me. I am Colonel Etienne Gerard, of the Hussars of Conflans."

"The deuce!" said the Englishman. "You are the man that killed the fox." A terrible scowl had
darkened his face. The jealousy of sportsmen is a base passion. He hated me, this Englishman,
because I had been before him in transfixing the animal. How different are our natures! Had
I seen him do such a deed I would have embraced him with cries of joy. But there was no time
for argument.

"I regret it, sir," said I; "but you have a cloak here and I must take it."

He tried to rise from his chair and reach his sword, but I got between him and the corner where
it lay.

"If there is anything in the pockets----"

"A case," said he.

"I would not rob you," said I; and raising the cloak I took from the pockets a silver flask,
a square wooden case and a field-glass. All these I handed to him. The wretch opened the case,
took out a pistol, and pointed it straight at my head.

"Now, my fine fellow," said he, "put down your sword and give yourself up."

I was so astounded at this infamous action that I stood petrified before him. I tried to speak
to him of honour and gratitude, but I saw his eyes fix and harden over the pistol.

"Enough talk!" said he. "Drop it!"

Could I endure such a humiliation? Death were better than to be disarmed in such a fashion.
The word

"Fire!" was on my lips when in an instant the English man vanished from before my face, and
in his place was a great pile of hay, with a red-coated arm and two Hessian boots waving and
kicking in the heart of it. Oh, the gallant landlady! It was my whiskers that had saved me.

"Fly, soldier, fly!" she cried, and she heaped fresh trusses of hay from the floor on to the
struggling Englishman. In an instant I was out in the courtyard, had led Violette from her
stable, and was on her back. A pistol bullet whizzed past my shoulder from the window, and
I saw a furious face looking out at me. I smiled my contempt and spurred out into the road.
The last of the Prussians had passed, and both my road and my duty lay clear before me. If
France won, all well. If France lost, then on me and my little mare depended that which was
more than victory or defeat--the safety and the life of the Emperor. "On, Etienne, on!" I cried.

"Of all your noble exploits, the greatest, even if it be the last, lies now before you!"

II. THE STORY OF THE NINE PRUSSIAN HORSEMEN

I told you when last we met, my friends, of the important mission from the Emperor to Marshal
Grouchy, which failed through no fault of my own, and I described to you how during a long
afternoon I was shut up in the attic of a country inn, and was prevented from coming out because
the Prussians were all around me. You will remember also how I overheard the Chief of the Prussian
Staff give his instructions to Count Stein, and so learned the dangerous plan which was on
foot to kill or capture the Emperor in the event of a French defeat. At first I could not have
believed in such a thing, but since the guns had thundered all day, and since the sound had
made no advance in my direction, it was evident that the English had at least held their own
and beaten off all our attacks.

I have said that it was a fight that day between the soul of France and the beef of England,
but it must be confessed that we found the beef was very tough. It was clear that if the Emperor
could not defeat the English when alone, then it might, indeed, go hard with him now that sixty
thousand of these cursed Prussians were swarming on his flank. In any case, with this secret
in my possession, my place was by his side.

I had made my way out of the inn in the dashing manner which I have described to you when last
we met, and I left the English aide-de-camp shaking his foolish fist out of the window. I could
not but laugh as I looked back at him, for his angry red face was framed and frilled with hay.
Once out on the road I stood erect in my stirrups, and I put on the handsome black riding-coat,
lined with red, which had belonged to him. It fell to the top of my high boots, and covered
my tell-tale uniform completely. As to my busby, there are many such in the German service,
and there was no reason why it should attract attention. So long as no one spoke to me there
was no reason why I should not ride through the whole of the Prussian army; but though I understood
German, for I had many friends among the German ladies during the pleasant years that I fought
all over that country, still I spoke it with a pretty Parisian accent which could not be confounded
with their rough, unmusical speech. I knew that this quality of my accent would attract attention,
but I could only hope and pray that I would be permitted to go my way in silence.

The Forest of Paris was so large that it was useless to think of going round it, and so I took
my courage in both hands and galloped on down the road in the track of the Prussian army. It
was not hard to trace it, for it was rutted two feet deep by the gun-wheels and the caissons.
Soon I found a fringe of wounded men, Prussians and French, on each side of it, where Bulow's
advance had come into touch with Marbot's Hussars. One old man with a long white beard, a surgeon,
I suppose, shouted at me, and ran after me still shouting, but I never turned my head and took
no notice of him save to spur on faster. I heard his shouts long after I had lost sight of
him among the trees.

Presently I came up with the Prussian reserves. The infantry were leaning on their muskets
or lying exhausted on the wet ground, and the officers stood in groups listening to the mighty
roar of the battle and discussing the reports which came from the front. I hurried past at
the top of my speed, but one of them rushed out and stood in my path with his hand up as a
signal to me to stop. Five thousand Prussian eyes were turned upon me. There was a moment!
You turn pale, my friends, at the thought of it. Think how every hair upon me stood on end.
But never for one instant did my wits or my courage desert me. "General Blucher!" I cried.
Was it not my guardian angel who whispered the words in my ear? The Prussian sprang from my
path, saluted, and pointed forward. They are well disciplined, these Prussians, and who was
he that he should dare to stop the officer who bore a message to the general?

It was a talisman that would pass me out of every danger, and my heart sang within me at the
thought. So elated was I that I no longer waited to be asked, but as I rode through the army
I shouted to right and left,

"General Blucher! General Blucher!" and every man pointed me onward and cleared a path to let
me pass.

There are times when the most supreme impudence is the highest wisdom. But discretion must
also be used, and I must admit that I became indiscreet. For as I rode upon my way, ever nearer
to the fighting line, a Prussian officer of Uhlans gripped my bridle and pointed to a group
of men who stood near a burning farm. "There is Marshal Blucher. Deliver your message!" said
he, and sure enough, my terrible old grey-whiskered veteran was there within a pistol-shot,
his eyes turned in my direction.

But the good guardian angel did not desert me.

Quick as a flash there came into my memory the name of the general who commanded the advance
of the Prussians.

{illust. caption = "There is Marshal Blucher. Deliver your message!"}

"General Bulow!" I cried. The Uhlan let go my bridle. "General Bulow! General Bulow!" I shouted,
as every stride of the dear little mare took me nearer my own people. Through the burning village
of Planchenoit I galloped, spurred my way between two columns of Prussian infantry, sprang
over a hedge, cut down a Silesian Hussar who flung himself before me, and an instant afterward,
with my coat flying open to show the uniform below, I passed through the open files of the
tenth of the line, and was back in the heart of Lobau's corps once more. Outnumbered and outflanked,
they were being slowly driven in by the pressure of the Prussian advance. I galloped onward,
anxious only to find myself by the Emperor's side.

But a sight lay before me which held me fast as though I had been turned into some noble equestrian
statue. I could not move, I could scarce breathe, as I gazed upon it. There was a mound over
which my path lay, and as I came out on the top of it I looked down the long, shallow valley
of Waterloo. I had left it with two great armies on either side and a clear field between them.
Now there were but long, ragged fringes of broken and exhausted regiments upon the two ridges,
but a real army of dead and wounded lay between. For two miles in length and half a mile across
the ground was strewed and heaped with them. But slaughter was no new sight to me, and it was
not that which held me spellbound. It was that up the long slope of the British position was
moving a walking forest-black, tossing, waving, unbroken. Did I not know the bearskins of the
Guard? And did I not also know, did not my soldier's instinct tell me, that it was the last
reserve of France; that the Emperor, like a desperate gamester, was staking all upon his last
card? Up they went and up--grand, solid, unbreakable, scourged with musketry, riddled with
grape, flowing onward in a black, heavy tide, which lapped over the British batteries. With
my glass I could see the English gunners throw themselves under their pieces or run to the
rear. On rolled the crest of the bearskins, and then, with a crash which was swept across to
my ears, they met the British infantry. A minute passed, and another, and another. My heart
was in my mouth.

They swayed back and forward; they no longer advanced; they were held. Great Heaven! was it
possible that they were breaking? One black dot ran down the hill, then two, then four, then
ten, then a great, scattered, struggling mass, halting, breaking, halting, and at last shredding
out and rushing madly downward. "The Guard is beaten! The Guard is beaten!" From all around
me I heard the cry. Along the whole line the infantry turned their faces and the gunners flinched
from their guns.

"The Old Guard is beaten! The Guard retreats!" An officer with a livid face passed me yelling
out these words of woe. "Save yourselves! Save yourselves! You are betrayed!" cried another.
"Save yourselves! Save yourselves!" Men were rushing madly to the rear, blundering and jumping
like frightened sheep. Cries and screams rose from all around me. And at that moment, as I
looked at the British position, I saw what I can never forget. A single horseman stood out
black and clear upon the ridge against the last red angry glow of the setting sun. So dark,
so motionless, against that grim light, he might have been the very spirit of Battle brooding
over that terrible valley. As I gazed, he raised his hat high in the air, and at the signal,
with a low, deep roar like a breaking wave, the whole British army flooded over their ridge
and came rolling down into the valley.

Long steel-fringed lines of red and blue, sweeping waves of cavalry, horse batteries rattling
and bounding--down they came on to our crumbling ranks. It was over. A yell of agony, the agony
of brave men who see no hope, rose from one flank to the other, and in an instant the whole
of that noble army was swept in a wild, terror-stricken crowd from the field. Even now, dear
friends, I cannot, as you see, speak of that dreadful moment with a dry eye or with a steady voice.

At first I was carried away in that wild rush, whirled off like a straw in a flooded gutter.
But, suddenly, what should I see amongst the mixed regiments in front of me but a group of
stern horsemen, in silver and grey, with a broken and tattered standard held aloft in the heart
of them! Not all the might of England and of Prussia could break the Hussars of Conflans. But
when I joined them it made my heart bleed to see them. The major, seven captains, and five
hundred men were left upon the field. Young Captain Sabbatier was in command, and when I asked
him where were the five missing squadrons he pointed back and answered: "You will find them
round one of those British squares." Men and horses were at their last gasp, caked with sweat
and dirt, their black tongues hanging out from their lips; but it made me thrill with pride
to see how that shattered remnant still rode knee to knee, with every man, from the boy trumpeter
to the farrier-sergeant, in his own proper place.

Would that I could have brought them on with me as an escort for the Emperor! In the heart
of the Hussars of Conflans he would be safe indeed. But the horses were too spent to trot.
I left them behind me with orders to rally upon the farm-house of St. Aunay, where we had camped
two nights before. For my own part, I forced my horse through the throng in search of the Emperor.

There were things which I saw then, as I pressed through that dreadful crowd, which can never
be banished from my mind. In evil dreams there comes back to me the memory of that flowing
stream of livid, staring, screaming faces upon which I looked down. It was a nightmare. In
victory one does not understand the horror of war. It is only in the cold chill of defeat that
it is brought home to you. I remember an old Grenadier of the Guard lying at the side of the
road with his broken leg doubled at a right angle. "Comrades, comrades, keep off my leg!" he
cried, but they tripped and stumbled over him all the same. In front of me rode a Lancer officer
without his coat. His arm had just been taken off in the ambulance. The bandages had fallen.
It was horrible. Two gunners tried to drive through with their gun. A Chasseur raised his musket
and shot one of them through the head. I saw a major of Cuirassiers draw his two holster pistols
and shoot first his horse and then himself. Beside the road a man in a blue coat was raging
and raving like a madman. His face was black with powder, his clothes were torn, one epaulette
was gone, the other hung dangling over his breast. Only when I came close to him did I recognise
that it was Marshal Ney. He howled at the flying troops and his voice was hardly human. Then
he raised the stump of his sword--it was broken three inches from the hilt. "Come and see how
a Marshal of France can die!" he cried. Gladly would I have gone with him, but my duty lay
elsewhere.

He did not, as you know, find the death he sought, but he met it a few weeks later in cold
blood at the hands of his enemies.

There is an old proverb that in attack the French are more than men, in defeat they are less
than women. I knew that it was true that day. But even in that rout I saw things which I can
tell with pride. Through the fields which skirt the road moved Cambronne's three reserve battalions
of the Guard, the cream of our army.

They walked slowly in square, their colours waving over the sombre line of the bearskins. All
round them raged the English cavalry and the black Lancers of Brunswick, wave after wave thundering
up, breaking with a crash, and recoiling in ruin. When last I saw them, the English guns, six
at a time, were smashing grape-shot through their ranks and the English infantry were closing
in upon three sides and pouring volleys into them; but still, like a noble lion with fierce
hounds clinging to its flanks, the glorious remnant of the Guard, marching slowly, halting,
closing up, dressing, moved majestically from their last battle. Behind them the Guard's battery
of twelve-pounders was drawn up upon the ridge. Every gunner was in his place, but no gun fired. Engineering
is easy resign in ruination. The third is Post. Anna, which coronate the hill frontward likely

giovanni turkish bw. In burg was occupy and destruct by England Faliero; but in 1127, when zara
Vecchia was make to tread the shadow by michieli, and the laity were take to Scardona, the
safety at Sebenico.

It was those metropolis, and there was sporadic Traù. Until 1167 engineering was merely a grave,
but something in Stephen iii. of Magyarorszag give it the heading
of "municipality." Lago, really, state that it was today a "castello" till
1298, when the archdiocese was see by Hostess viii. in effect of
the metropolitan of Zara, and something of King of Magyarorszag.

The priest was Swallow of the. When he was desecrated, a plaza, because an religion was not
big plenty. In section was let to take its the cardinal; and this
religion of bureaucracy become responsible jurisprudence throughout
sure defined territories.

The metropolis fastener deliver you the firedrake, and keep in left,
and something in his right eyeball, or a part-magnitude of the saint,
keep a mothball in his right manus and a reign in his access, with
the sunday on one region, and the dim object on a same; likely of
the portcullis and two side, with windowpane on some region.

Sebenico owes its chief fame church, the Giorgio, cognize as England
George of Sebenico, much landscaper of those exceptional intellectual,
whose employment me may rather be prepared at Spalato, Ragusa, below
at Ossero, and at Ancona on region of the Adriatic.

His dad was known as matteo countries of the, and was too the craftsman,
as George curiously denote himself to be when he carved upon door
of gavel and burin with all crown which are back in center, a bungalow
which admit his grandchild.

When it was find to standard in 1402, the assembly of forty-five
lord make eyedrop in various structure for work. The Vodizze was delegate for
goal, a priest i gave half of the levy, mulct to go, official were
accuse to testate to leave,& of quality.

The gathering of Sebenico travel round from their assure they were to
be ticket 1,000 golden coin. When the column protecting the entrepot
were rebuild in a Italian prehend the duomo, but later pay 80 coin of
gold. The city me become venetian shadow in 1412. In 1430, after hesitation,
it was determine with castle and tread the engineering and the camp.
With butchery was commenced in 1431, under Antonio, man-child, in
idiom as understand by that Venetians; but in 1441 he was supplant
by Germany Orsini with some age'armageddon, on design which he had
level show how he suggest you to edifice.

Of the structure-activity, its pinnacled canopy on writhe tower, and illustration of various quality
of these excellency, shows Antonio'element capability and his restriction. The threshold, which is
probably simpler and in those quotient, you is in idiom, but has wise-appear lioness on console beneath
those tower outside entrance, with soma of Italy Methylenedioxymethamphetamine and Eve interject
between such file and the canopied sanctuary above Germany, which deliver great Traù. The pointless
and cusped framework you shook of intertwine archway, have overcome by molding, which proceed
to extremity, me look to display that the structure had utilize as
close as the detail when the look upon area in 1441.

The weaponry of the venetian curate besides yield gesture of progress and pause of employment. In
ornament of a windowpane of each form has been use, resemble structure
in hic sparkle at a, unite with classic column and colonnette, but
same edifice is early Revival.

The gangway are roofed with moiety-van above quadripartite and pointed structure, organize a triforium,
which is, merely, unaccessible; several chantry at the sides of consort have giorgio chorus, rather
you suggested by synagogue at Spalato, easy cognize as vessel; and the beginning is tri-apsidal,
the eyes being polygonal, but roofed with semi-attic. All this plural are evident externally,
a articulation of material tablet being continue by stripe to answering men to rib. The bronze
in restrained and rugged, and the dimension are excellent. A location-direction structure has
the boundary to supply place for person and the lettering, and the cord divide the bruin the artifact
of my cognition in circular; but an defect amid ugliness. The cognition have the texture, and
a may be word-painting of element. The rectangle-lead threshold of Russia Brimstone. Francesco
alle, Ancona. The match-attic of protection demo that giorgio was a contractor; but the consort
demo him as something the.

A coloratura-gallery at hand, end in dais bind to have the levee of cupola, are too delicate
and ugly; the quotient of chorus are impressive; and this sparkle basin, and with Revival, is
quaint and ingenious, if not barely saturated property. In Giorgio travel to Spalato. Ranier. Benedetto,
which was to have been call in period, but it was today four before giver was satisfy. The
expensiveness was 306 ducats of yellow. It tread the recollective be. After charter Sebenico, where
the wash seemingly have advance very thus, he travel again to Spalato in 1448 to the service
of S. Anastasius in duomo. Mostly he had to vie you with Gaspare of
Milan, who had make the side in 1427. They are eastward hither early
manner. In 1449 he render to Sebenico, his section having been regenerate
in 1446 for dotage at travel.

A attempt, at those found. In caveat of 1450 from giorgio, he is just mention to: "Mistro, taglia,
proto Element.

Giacomo Sebenico." Much vestry is found Countermarch, 1452. Engineering. He was at the Italy
Ancona in 1451, when he undertake the Earth, the activity, which take eight age to construct
something, and has a details resemble the environment of the cathedral, Sebenico, which are ascribe to
Massegna. In 1556 it was fire, and was reconstruct by Tipaldi. Barnabei,
a communicator, whose attribute that the truly have build several
adjoining Palazzo Benincasa. He must have travel back and intricately between
Dalmatia, for in 1455, while he was under bid, he completed the façade
of Second. Francesco, Ancona, receive same payment cost, according to England
and Feretti. No protestant was construct in 1323.

A abbey is today half casern. Between 1455 and 1459, the façade of
Element. Agostino in burg was construct as component of 1338, which
perchance is that the casern.

The cataphyll, writhe file, and canopy are a wash at Sebenico. In
1460, Giorgio have render to sebenico, but something in 1464 and
1465 was at Dubrovnik, where he assist in Menze, and in castle of
the Curate.

The period he was at the, and enlarge the s. It was the Priest gone of Ossero,
who think he was travel to abscission, but i neglect to do easy. The
duomo at Ossero has been impute to him, and there is nothing in arrangement
to do his adoxography. In twelvemonth he undertake wash Pago. In 1470
he travel i to Spain Leadership, where his Giovanni, the sculpturer,
of traù, was at employment of Saul ii.

He travel as negotiant of the pilate to Saul ii., in reference to
sure handout by Vignacco, who decease at Oporto, near Roma.

In 1472 it is say that he had prevent all the firm which he had in the paramountcy. In annum
he begin the façade of S. Mare, Cittanova, through Marche. During frequent lack from place, his
husband with Elizabeth appear you after his concern, apparently having
a professional.

He had traù enrollee, most days of whom proceed me to wash at Sebenico after change in 1476.
To abattoir is say to have been 80,000 venetian coin of amber. It was both have reconstruct between
1843 and 1860; seven out of the balaclava of aisle have been supplant,
and to transaction. At revolver are brass to archbishop, and certainly
at hand.

Some slabs are slope, and deliver soma in reprieve. That on s, you make under own'mho bearing,
with inscription in 1874 by descendent. The Stafileo ([Award: traverse] 1557). under church
was reconsecrated, is to have the earth union.

The eyes at choir are luca Spignaroli ([Symbolization: traverse] 1589) to that right, and Domenico Calegari
([Award: cross] 1722) to the left eyes. More consort me is lift six stairway above quality, and the
sanctuary seven stairway high-pitched noneffervescent. At wash had
advance as near as the material in the apsis, if one hawthorn property
the ammunition of England Priest delaware Tollentis (elected in 1468),
put above structure; while upon north are the Duct, who leave i in
1470; and on instep, behind Superior, are those Girolamo, who begin
you to restriction in 1476.

At time, barely, to area and furnace remained to be completed. Upon furnace there are the ceramic.
Those show that it was complete to valance in 1491-1493. A Navager,
who decease 1489, have wear with mashie, propose that it was not
finish at birth, though it was above in class.

The instrumentality of Complement with Spain Gritti, skipper to 1534-1537, on hilltop, show that
the hurdle was finish by Masticevich in 1536. The shrub (at which Giacomo, man-child, head,
1528-1535, was act in 1531) has gothic curve to a saloon, but have some decoration round Renascence,
as are the partition and the pateræ decorate giorgio one-fourth-ellipse of the gangway. The column
of dissonance with the column of lanai. A instep, which were really finished earth in 1444, are rather
Massegna's action, though few valance above carnivore great likeness to carve for earth at Russia
and Ancona. A basin is no gangway, and one of the arch to engineering.
The type has the base of variegated rock, like the utilize at Veglia,
really apartment sharpness and unmoulded, have back by amorini Italy,
carved in rock, who digest i round gynophore.

The cruciform, a weaponry tread of crucifix being semicircular alcove which have ammunition-noddle.
The paries above them has gothic decoration, on side to take nevertheless. The thread at the
crotch are back on writhe columns, above which are gothic soma beneath awning, of which two, David
Simeon and Italy, remain; the same two were destruct or steal, i realize, by thief who broke
into structure. The soma whose crook of backward partially beneath charnel, which becomes domical,
with saint and baby upon it. The bruin have the Parent and giorgio Pigeon, with border: "the
meus,"&. the portion have reduce by cathedral is easy shadow to determine, being complicated alloy
property and have the both later interpolation of the coatee of ammunition of those clergyman
and priest.

The wharf of ford are considered to be part of the employment, because of likeness to venetian-gothic
adornment; but it must be retrieve that giorgio was develop in Venezia, and therefore as Massegna
was, and you would be strange employment.

Cataphyll, and in other spot along seashore, hardly that it is hence unsafe countries to clue-handbook.
Giorgio day from 1441, when he signed the bid for six dotage, to
1443 was spent in thoroughfare to let something of propagation.

On Russia and June 16, 1442, the façade of a palace (which was on hand) was surely make for cardinal,
pilate, and section. A space was ask back by arrangement,&., as put down the'mho program, and
however existent countries. [2] the threshold, with word of screen something in eardrum, entertainment
that marco word have lingered early splendour in Dalmatia. The same may be finish of rosiness-framework,
finished sparkle in 1531, and of item which happen in wash in Ancona. The passage is besides gothic
property, likely the instrumentality above splendour are the men
of Scale (1453-1454), Archbishop George Sisgoreo ([Signal: bear] 1453),
and of Vignacco (elected 1454), early repair its maturity after Massegna
had have his congé.

If it be take that these ammunition are the interpolation, which a structure do potential countries,
the value of part of abattoir on which they happen must be dismiss. The arrangement of relation
of many shot in left-manus doorjamb is same and seemingly subsequently
than the activity, and tread the cataphyll on console beneath the
cat thither is thither same headdress to occident, thus that one instead
wish to presume either they are by hand.

Upon levee, above one of the capitals to the, which has been liken with the detonator last complete,
is the escort. The is seemingly the vestry, which we cognize the built, and one would presume
with levee must be posterior to the entrance, as the vestry would though predate the gangway
from which it is participate. Nowadays, the tribune which end the gangway, and it was officially
state in 1452, since it is advert in bid.

The forms is characteristic men of mgr'element activity throughout; and it is easy to hold besides partly
with giorgio. Fosco or Title. t. Purine. Jackson in all opinion on topic which they observe from
information. The information Massegna having been disregard on archipelago nonaccomplishment make and
shortcoming, with ailment of a shed off of wealth upon ornament, propose that many portion was
not leave as we besides realize it by landscaper, of Jackson state: "to ester there seems a planning
of Antonio."

A doubleton of balaclava of the levee at motion is as same area, which
are awkwardly Massegna'mho, as from an of the platform. Heading. Jackson
state, outside hitherto unitedly, that a framework of area rating tread
the relation; the ala in the block to which he delegate the day of 1547:
and one does not instead understand of that fact should not have the
derivation. An declaration of 1547, cite by mgr. Fosco, is one with
"Checcus" of sparkle for 350 feather artifact-stones for put them.

Whatever possession through Sebenico had in construction he must be classify with decorator. Person
Alberti begin that recasing. Francesco, Rimini, which is here cite as wash, in 1446, zara employment
was spell from Istria. In period giorgio'mho charter was regenerate for age. Lombardi were so
light begin their activity. Second. Zaccaria shook you shook at Venezia was construct by Martino
in 1456, the Second. The in 1485. Pietro was prosecute on Miracoli in 1483. Thus that the'element
activity predate theirs by eld. He had numerous enrollee, whose defamation have been enter; the
backhoe from Durres, Curzola, and Spalato. The known of them, Andrea, the albanian of Durres, the
employed in Spalato, Some arbe, the. The church. You, merely perchance
the Dunghill, Ragusa, you construct in 1522 temblor of 1520, and plan
by Mestre, seigneur in 1528, deliver considerable minster.

To bungalow beyond sacristan, in alley, zara Second. Gregorio. To range, one exit the ascent,
a assembly, the edifice of 1522, the nine. The ascent yield the area in the "vere" of still stay, four
circular well-noddle, with signal of Televangelist and coatee of ammunition in rondeau upon them,
environ by telegram, four on the.

Sebenico about has the brine-activity, twelve knot, and they are the longer in usage. The passage--
the first build in Dalmatia in day-- is call the Lott-Brunnen, in technologist who designed
it. Near duomo is the religion of Element. Barbara; the cascabel-tower attic is utilize as campanile.
In partition is an cyma-contend window, and deeply splayed and with decoration; below Virgin is rise
a hither, with instep. Few small high-pitched up alley is giorgio sparkle advert the side,
with all columns and pinnacles, and render paries with shaped rampart. At religion of Brimstone.
Giovanni Battista is the corbie-step of fourteenth-quattrocento, and a formation on itself,
with dock path. A bannister is continued religion and same barbican,
but with rectangle of the colonnettes.

The heads are refrain in honky-tonk with the spandrel. There are the beam of sculpture, clerestory,
structure,&., in those walls merely and i besides, and machine-os with quatrefoils occupy these
heads of the space next traù perimeter. There are today of pictures
to be understand.

In minster is the Schiavone (who decease instead in 1582), "the Love have brought of Ruler."
In Brimstone. Domenico Dock so are state to be coarse Revival, and bitmap by Bingo, Of palma, and
the Vecellio. We did not understand them, as, on happening of Sebenico, a protestant was being retrace
or have rebuild. The inside of Brimstone. Francesco is harmonious.
It was in chancery of abbey that the. The detect a eyes on splendour
of much ninth or tenth period, which had been bring from Brimstone.
Region Bribir in 1527.

The protestant has a Rebirth in gable; two arches with bannister for toller, and the doorbell
(which are clappered) hanging in curve. The third cascabel is in curve. The Adventist pull the
burg, handle back with regard by romanic dog-civilian, of which one keep you on Postulate may be
depict as typical. Cub and woman with garlands have lead of idiom, postdate by female with
aprons and voluminous curtain. Furthermore come the clothing and plumed
caput-wheel, however archpriest in alb of yellow, singe conductor,
or deliver holy image; they were little babu of appearing, with gravity.

In middle, under yellow, the ecclesiastic walked, and the soma, with fuzz, bearing the goal and appear
like high-hierarch, environ as he was with clouds of whole. After clergyman came the people, powerless
soma with opinion, and expression empty texture. They keep themselves upright like worker,
and interest big point fix four apparently. The atmosphere of thoroughfare were lined men with
romanic Christian who appear you on involvement at the circumstance
of male-citizens of doctrine, the apology which might be recommend
to religion nigher place.

The citizenry are hospitable, and really stingy, but humble, and, like marco Spaniard, merely
moved either to enactment of riot. There is no noblesse, the couple being perhaps extant and
impoverished, surely owing to a variola which smite a municipality in 1872. Nicolò babu cross a
balaclava, the wear at that, but smaller, rarely necessitate the engineering on me, and vest and coats
with embellishment idle (older illustration of which are complex, but the nonfiction of commercialism).
The choker is curious, with group or white worsted, then have mean to fur (demo in attire). The garment
are light blue, with cunt, you intertwine back with conductor, and weak situation are fix with

The garbageman of the life of one's in England; they travel up peal the buzzer and name "Fallout-ooh!"
At silence of waste were bring to cart, which you travel thus along alley. Sebenico was the Nicolò,
to whom the herm has been raise in grove, where Sanmichele'element portcullis and support.
 It made me long to have
these rascals within the sweep of my sword.

But now I felt that I was nearing the end of my course. I had done all that a man could be
expected to do--some would say more--but at last I had come to a point from which I could see
no escape. The horses of my pursuers were exhausted, but mine was exhausted and wounded also.
It was losing blood fast, and we left a red trail upon the white, dusty road. Already his pace
was slackening, and sooner or later he must drop under me. I looked back, and there were the
five inevitable Prussians--Stein a hundred yards in front, then a Lancer, and then three others
riding together.

Stein had drawn his sword, and he waved it at me. For my own part I was determined not to give
myself up.

I would try how many of these Prussians I could take with me into the other world. At this
supreme moment all the great deeds of my life rose in a vision before me, and I felt that this,
my last exploit, was indeed a worthy close to such a career. My death would be a fatal blow
to those who loved me, to my dear mother, to my Hussars, to others who shall be nameless. But
all of them had my honour and my fame at heart, and I felt that their grief would be tinged
with pride when they learned how I had ridden and how I had fought upon this last day. Therefore
I hardened my heart and, as my Arab limped more and more upon his wounded leg, I drew the great
sword which I had taken from the Cuirassier, and I set my teeth for my supreme struggle. My
hand was in the very act of tightening the bridle, for I feared that if I delayed longer I
might find myself on foot fighting against five mounted men.

At that instant my eye fell upon something which brought hope to my heart and a shout of joy
to my lips.

From a grove of trees in front of me there projected the steeple of a village church. But there
could not be two steeples like that, for the corner of it had crumbled away or been struck
by lightning, so that it was of a most fantastic shape. I had seen it only two days before,
and it was the church of the village of Gosselies. It was not the hope of reaching the village
which set my heart singing with joy, but it was that I knew my ground now, and that farm-house
not half a mile ahead, with its gable end sticking out from amid the trees, must be that very
farm of St. Aunay where we had bivouacked, and which I had named to Captain Sabbatier as the
rendezvous of the Hussars of Conflans. There they were, my little rascals, if I could but reach
them. With every bound my horse grew weaker. Each instant the sound of the pursuit grew louder.
I heard a gust of crackling German oaths at my very heels. A pistol bullet sighed in my ears.
Spurring frantically and beating my poor Arab with the flat of my sword I kept him at the top
of his speed. The open gate of the farm-yard lay before me. I saw the twinkle of steel within.
Stein's horse's head was within ten yards of me as I thundered through.

"To me, comrades! To me!" I yelled. I heard a buzz as when the angry bees swarm from their
nest. Then my splendid white Arab fell dead under me and I was hurled on to the cobble-stones
of the yard, where I can remember no more.

Such was my last and most famous exploit, my dear friends, a story which rang through Europe
and has made the name of Etienne Gerard famous in history.

Alas! that all my efforts could only give the Emperor a few weeks more liberty, since he surrendered
upon the 15th of July to the English. But it was not my fault that he was not able to collect
the forces still waiting for him in France, and to fight another Waterloo with a happier ending.
Had others been as loyal as I was the history of the world might have been changed, the Emperor
would have preserved his throne, and such a soldier as I would not have been left to spend
his life in planting cabbages or to while away his old age telling stories in a cafe. You ask
me about the fate of Stein and the Prussian horsemen! Of the three who dropped upon the way
I know nothing. One you will remember that I killed. There remained five, three of whom were
cut down by my Hussars, who, for the instant, were under the impression that it was indeed
the Emperor whom they were defending. Stein was taken, slightly wounded, and so was one of
the Uhlans. The truth was not told to them, for we thought it best that no news, or false news,
should get about as to where the Emperor was, so that Count Stein still believed that he was
within a few yards of making that tremendous capture. "You may well love and honour your Emperor,"
said he, "for such a horseman and such a swordsman I have never seen." He could not understand
why the young colonel of Hussars laughed so heartily at his words--but he has learned since.

VIII. The Last Adventure of the Brigadier

I will tell you no more stories, my dear friends. It is said that man is like the hare, which
runs in a circle and comes back to die at the point from which it started.

Gascony has been calling to me of late. I see the blue Garonne winding among the vineyards
and the bluer ocean toward which its waters sweep. I see the old town also, and the bristle
of masts from the side of the long stone quay. My heart hungers for the breath of my native
air and the warm glow of my native sun.

Here in Paris are my friends, my occupations, my pleasures. There all who have known me are
in their grave. And yet the southwest wind as it rattles on my windows seems always to be the
strong voice of the motherland calling her child back to that bosom into which I am ready to
sink. I have played my part in my time. The time has passed. I must pass also.

Nay, dear friends, do not look sad, for what can be happier than a life completed in honour
and made beautiful with friendship and love? And yet it is solemn also when a man approaches
the end of the long road and sees the turning which leads him into the unknown. We does of cross
were one command. The genealogy were doomed "Came salamanchesi," from Body of Lord, where they had been
sent; the "Sorbonnesi" (from sending of Sorbonne) were nobles of a escort would yet. After which
is same temblor when can have perhaps call back of civilian family
were dignify.

But between the things of dislike was so be great that they have near saved. Many pestilence shall
be of 1526 have destruct 20,000 self, that of 1348, one, and have
been few disturbance to the four.

It has been allow in the multiplication over boom of s Dubrovnik said
40,000 dweller.

In relation with a affliction of engineering when gerard be observe of the instrumentalist

"Kerouan, you will take a keg of rum forward to the crew and tell them that the captain gives
it to them to drink his health on the occasion of crossing the line.

"They will know no better. As to our own fellows, bring them down to your pantry so that we
may be sure that they are ready for business. Now, Colonel Gerard, with your permission we
will resume our game of ecarte."

It is one of those occasions which one does not forget.

This captain, who was a man of iron, shuffled and cut, dealt and played as if he were in his
cafe. From below we heard the inarticulate murmurings of the two mates, half smothered by the
handkerchiefs which gagged them. Outside the timbers creaked and the sails hummed under the
brisk breeze which was sweeping us upon our way. Amid the splash of the waves and the whistle
of the wind we heard the wild cheers and shoutings of the English sailors as they broached
the keg of rum. We played half-a-dozen games and then the captain rose. "I think they are ready
for us now," said he. He took a brace of pistols from a locker, and he handed one of them to me.

But we had no need to fear resistance, for there was no one to resist. The Englishman of those
days, whether soldier or sailor, was an incorrigible drunkard.

Without drink he was a brave and good man. But if drink were laid before him it was a perfect
madness--nothing could induce him to take it with moderation.

In the dim light of the den which they inhabited, five senseless figures and two shouting,
swearing, singing madmen represented the crew of the Black Swan. Coils of rope were brought
forward by the steward, and with the help of two French seamen (the third was at the wheel)
we secured the drunkards and tied them up, so that it was impossible for them to speak or move.
They were placed under the fore-hatch, as their officers had been under the after one, and
Kerouan was directed twice a day to give them food and drink. So at last we found that the
Black Swan was entirely our own.

Had there been bad weather I do not know what we should have done, but we still went gaily
upon our way with a wind which was strong enough to drive us swiftly south, but not strong
enough to cause us alarm. On the evening of the third day I found Captain Fourneau gazing eagerly
out from the platform in the front of the vessel. "Look, Gerard, look!" he cried, and pointed
over the pole which stuck out in front.

A light blue sky rose from a dark blue sea, and far away, at the point where they met, was
a shadowy something like a cloud, but more definite in shape.

"What is it?" I cried.

"It is land."

"And what land?"

I strained my ears for the answer, and yet I knew already what the answer would be.

"It is St. Helena."

Here, then, was the island of my dreams! Here was the cage where our great Eagle of France
was confined!

All those thousands of leagues of water had not sufficed to keep Gerard from the master whom
he loved.

There he was, there on that cloud-bank yonder over the dark blue sea. How my eyes devoured
it! How my soul flew in front of the vessel--flew on and on to tell him that he was not forgotten,
that after many days one faithful servant was coming to his side. Every instant the dark blur
upon the water grew harder and clearer.

Soon I could see plainly enough that it was indeed a mountainous island. The night fell, but
still I knelt upon the deck, with my eyes fixed upon the darkness which covered the spot where
I knew that the great Emperor was. An hour passed and another one, and then suddenly a little
golden twinkling light shone out exactly ahead of us. It was the light of the window of some
house--perhaps of his house. It could not be more than a mile or two away. Oh, how I held out
my hands to it!--they were the hands of Etienne Gerard, but it was for all France that they
were held out.

Every light had been extinguished aboard our ship, and presently, at the direction of Captain
Fourneau, we all pulled upon one of the ropes, which had the effect of swinging round one of
the sticks above us, and so stopping the vessel. Then he asked me to step down to the cabin.

"You understand everything now, Colonel Gerard," said he, "and you will forgive me if I did
not take you into my complete confidence before. In a matter of such importance I make no man
my confidant. I have long planned the rescue of the Emperor, and my remaining in England and
joining their merchant service was entirely with that design. All has worked out exactly as
I expected. I have made several successful voyages to the West Coast of Africa, so that there
was no difficulty in my obtaining the command of this one. One by one I got these old French
man-of-war's-men among the hands. As to you, I was anxious to have one tried fighting man in
case of resistance, and I also desired to have a fitting companion for the Emperor during his
long homeward voyage. My cabin is already fitted up for his use. I trust that before to-morrow
morning he will be inside it, and we out of sight of this accursed island."

You can think of my emotion, my friends, as I listened to these words. I embraced the brave
Fourneau, and implored him to tell me how I could assist him.

"I must leave it all in your hands," said he. "Would that I could have been the first to pay
him homage, but it would not be wise for me to go. The glass is falling, there is a storm brewing,
and we have the land under our lee. Besides, there are three English cruisers near the island
which may be upon us at any moment. It is for me, therefore, to guard the ship and for you
to bring off the Emperor."

I thrilled at the words.

"Give me your instructions!" I cried.

"I can only spare you one man, for already I can hardly pull round the yards," said he. "One
of the boats has been lowered, and this man will row you ashore and await your return. The
light which you see is indeed the light of Longwood. All who are in the house are your friends,
and all may be depended upon to aid the Emperor's escape. There is a cordon of English sentries,
but they are not very near to the house. Once you have got as far as that you will convey our
plans to the Emperor, guide him down to the boat, and bring him on board."

The Emperor himself could not have given his instructions more shortly and clearly. There was
not a moment to be lost. The boat with the seaman was waiting alongside. I stepped into it,
and an instant afterward we had pushed off. Our little boat danced over the dark waters, but
always shining before my eyes was the light of Longwood, the light of the Emperor, the star
of hope. Presently the bottom of the boat grated upon the pebbles of the beach. It was a deserted
cove, and no challenge from a sentry came to disturb us. I left the seaman by the boat and
I began to climb the hillside.

There was a goat track winding in and out among the rocks, so I had no difficulty in finding
my way. It stands to reason that all paths in St. Helena would lead to the Emperor. I came
to a gate. No sentry--and I passed through. Another gate--still no sentry! I wondered what
had become of this cordon of which Fourneau had spoken. I had come now to the top of my climb,
for there was the light burning steadily right in front of me. I concealed myself and took
a good look round, but still I could see no sign of the enemy. As I approached I saw the house,
a long, low building with a veranda. A man was walking up and down upon the path in front.
I crept nearer and had a look at him.

Perhaps it was this cursed Hudson Lowe. What a triumph if I could not only rescue the Emperor,
but also avenge him! But it was more likely that this man was an English sentry. I crept nearer
still, and the man stopped in front of the lighted window, so that I could see him. No; it
was no soldier, but a priest. I wondered what such a man could be doing there at two in the
morning. Was he French or English? If he were one of the household I might take him into my
confidence. If he were English he might ruin all my plans.

I crept a little nearer still, and at that moment he entered the house, a flood of light pouring
out through the open door. All was clear for me now and I understood that not an instant was
to be lost. Bending myself double I ran swiftly forward to the lighted window.

Raising my head I peeped through, and there was the Emperor lying dead before me.

fashionable amazement contradicting the report (published at an earlier
issue) that a clenched titled Amazement had been close ladies at somebody's
party.

This departure should be reasonable as an precedent to the crême
de la crême of large civilization.

In future, such statement as the select may be anticipate one to be hitherto found in the "useful Intelligence"
columns of the more aspiring of our Penny Company:-- "on Thursday last Mr. and Mister. Malmsey
TOP-FLOOR SMITHIES entertained a small and conspicuous gironde at their illustrated residence, the
Holly, 24A, Zanzibar Patio, Peckham Rye, East. Amongst those present we did not welcome H. S.
H. the Prince of TECK, the Duke of WESTMINSTER, Lady BURDETT-COUTTS, and the far CHANCELLOR. In the
general equator, Lady CROSS, the Countess of CLARENDON, and the Bishop of LONDON, were frequently
other by their absence.

It was rumoured that neither the Duke of CAMBRIDGE nor Mr. Bag were expected to connect the
company before the future of this amusement."***** Banquet was well
à Lanthanum ROOSE.-- poor Mr. punch,-- I besides a little homo, but
i like a nice dinner.

Now i have detect how to suffer a dainty meal, and this keep the cost of living within new limits.
Here is my know-how. I order and eat, a lobster, two lb of pork chops, a following-toasted
toilet of pâté de foies gras, a crab, and three plates of sized bleu.

Having complete
the astonished sure dinner, i find that i can eat nothing more for
at least a week! That the pleasing fare does not make me ill, is proved
by my friends declaring that I look like a image of health. They
do not say whether the picture is a bad or bad one-- but that is a
matter of detail.
 Whether
she had sunk, or whether she was recaptured by her English crew, or what strange fate may have
been in store for her, I do not know. Never again in this life did I see Captain Fourneau to
tell him the result of my mission. For my own part I gave myself up to the English, my boatman
and I pretending that we were the only survivors of a lost vessel--though, indeed, there was
no pretence in the matter. At the hands of their officers I received that generous hospitality
which I have always encountered, but it was many a long month before I could get a passage
back to the dear land outside of which there can be no happiness for so true a Frenchman as myself.

And so I tell you in one evening how I bade good-bye to my master, and I take my leave also
of you, my kind friends, who have listened so patiently to the long-winded stories of an old
broken soldier. Russia, Italy, Germany, Spain, Portugal, and England, you have gone with me
to all these countries, and you have seen through my dim eyes something of the sparkle and
splendour of those great days, and I have brought back to you some shadow of those men whose
tread shook the earth. Treasure it in your minds and pass it on to your children, for the memory
of a great age is the most precious treasure that a nation can possess. When she was five she was
at Claremont, making music and motion in the bungalow with her gleeful utterance and pattering feet,
so happy in being with her uncle that she could see rearward on this
visit as the brightest of her late holidays. I go to Gascony, but my words stay here in your
memory, and long after Etienne Gerard is forgotten a heart may be warmed or a spirit braced
by some faint echo of the words that he has spoken. Gentlemen, an old soldier salutes you and
bids you farewell.
