AUGUST & SEPTEMBER
                                  1666

August 1st.  Up betimes to the settling of my last month's accounts, and I bless God I find
them very clear, and that I am worth L5700, the most that ever my book did yet make out.  So
prepared to attend the Duke of Yorke as usual, but Sir W. Pen, just as I was going out, comes
home from Sheernesse, and held me in discourse about publique business, till I come by coach
too late to St. James's, and there find that every thing stood still, and nothing done for
want of me. I left him going to Chappell, it being the common fast day, and the Duke of York
at Chappell.  And I to Mrs. Martin's, but she abroad, so I sauntered to or again to the Abbey,
and then to the parish church, fearfull of being seen to do so, and so after the parish church
was ended, I to the Swan and there dined upon a rabbit, and after dinner to Mrs. Martin's,
and there find Mrs. Burroughs, and by and by comes a pretty widow, one Mrs. Eastwood, and one
Mrs. Fenton, a maid; and here merry kissing and looking on their breasts, and all the innocent
pleasure in the world.  But, Lord! to see the dissembling of this widow, how upon the singing
of a certain jigg by Doll, Mrs. Martin's sister, she seemed to be sick and fainted and God
knows what, because the jigg, which her husband (who died this last sickness) loved.  But by
and by I made her as merry as is possible, and towzed and tumbled her as I pleased, and then
carried her and her sober pretty kinswoman Mrs. Fenton home to their lodgings in the new market
of my Lord Treasurer's, and there left them. Mightily pleased with this afternoon's mirth,
but in great pain to ride in a coach with them, for fear of being seen.  So home, and there
much pleased with my wife's drawing today in her pictures, and so to supper and to bed very
pleasant.

2nd.  [Up] and to the office, where we sat, and in discourse at the table with Sir W. Batten,
I was obliged to tell him it was an untruth, which did displease him mightily, and parted at
noon very angry with me.  At home find Lovett, who brought me some papers varnished, and showed
me my crucifix, which will be very fine when done.  He dined with me and Balty's wife, who
is in great pain for her husband, not hearing of him since the fight; but I understand he was
not in it, going hence too late, and I am glad of it.  Thence to the office, and thither comes
to me Creed, and he and I walked a good while, and then to the victualling office together,
and there with Mr. Gawden I did much business, and so away with Creed again, and by coach to
see my Lord Bruncker, who it seems was not well yesterday, but being come thither, I find his
coach ready to carry him abroad, but Tom, his footman, whatever the matter was, was lothe to
desire me to come in, but I walked a great while in the Piatza till I was going away, but by
and by my Lord himself comes down and coldly received me.  So I soon parted, having enough
for my over officious folly in troubling myself to visit him, and I am apt to think that he
was fearfull that my coming was out of design to see how he spent his time [rather] than to
enquire after his health.  So parted, and I with Creed down to the New Exchange Stairs, and
there I took water, and he parted, so home, and then down to Woolwich, reading and making an
end of the "Rival Ladys," and find it a very pretty play.  At Woolwich, it being now night,
I find my wife and Mercer, and Mr. Batelier and Mary there, and a supper getting ready. So
I staid, in some pain, it being late, and post night.  So supped and merrily home, but it was
twelve at night first.  However, sent away some letters, and home to bed.

3rd.  Up and to the office, where Sir W. Batten and I sat to contract for some fire-ships.
I there close all the morning.  At noon home to dinner, and then abroad to Sir Philip Warwicke's
at White Hall about Tangier one quarter tallys, and there had some serious discourse touching
money, and the case of the Navy, wherein all I could get of him was that we had the full understanding
of the treasure as much as my Lord Treasurer himself, and knew what he can do, and that whatever
our case is, more money cannot be got till the Parliament.  So talked of getting an account
ready as soon as we could to give the Parliament, and so very melancholy parted. So I back
again, calling my wife at her sister's, from whose husband we do now hear that he was safe
this week, and going in a ship to the fleete from the buoy of the Nore, where he has been all
this while, the fleete being gone before he got down.  So home, and busy till night, and then
to Sir W. Pen, with my wife, to sit and chat, and a small supper, and home to bed.

     [To spoom, or spoon, is to go right before the wind, without any
     sail.  Sea Dictionary.  Dryden uses the word

              "When virtue spooms before a prosperous gale,
               My heaving wishes help to fill the sail."
                                        Hind and Panther, iii. 96.]

4th.  Up, and to the office, where all the morning, and, at noon to dinner, and Mr. Cooke dined
with us, who is lately come from Hinchingbroke, [Lord Hinchingbrooke] who is also come to town:
The family all well.  Then I to the office, where very busy to state to Mr. Coventry the account
of the victuals of the fleete, and late at it, and then home to supper and to bed.

5th. (Lord's day).  Up, and down to the Old Swan, and there called Betty Michell and her husband,
and had two or three a long salutes from her out of sight of 'su mari', which pleased me mightily,
and so carried them by water to West minster, and I to St. James's, and there had a meeting
before the Duke of Yorke, complaining of want of money, but nothing done to any purpose, for
want we shall, so that now our advices to him signify nothing.  Here Sir W. Coventry did acquaint
the Duke of Yorke how the world do discourse of the ill method of our books, and that we would
consider how to answer any enquiry which shall be made after our practice therein, which will
I think concern the Controller most, but I shall make it a memento to myself.  Thence walked
to the Parish Church to have one look upon Betty Michell, and so away homeward by water, and
landed to go to the church, where, I believe, Mrs. Horsely goes, by Merchant-tailors' Hall,
and there I find in the pulpit Elborough, my old schoolfellow and a simple rogue, and yet I
find him preaching a very good sermon, and in as right a parson-like manner, and in good manner
too, as I have heard any body; and the church very full, which is a surprising consideration;
but I did not see her.  So home, and had a  good dinner, and after dinner with my wife, and
Mercer, and Jane by water, all the afternoon up as high as Morclaeke with great pleasure, and
a fine day, reading over the second part of the, "Siege of Rhodes," with great delight.  We
landed and walked at Barne-elmes, and then at the Neat Houses I landed and bought a millon,--[melon]--and
we did also land and eat and drink at Wandsworth, and so to the Old Swan, and thence walked
home.  It being a mighty fine cool evening, and there being come, my wife and I spent an houre
in the garden, talking of our living in the country, when I shall be turned out of the office,
as I fear the Parliament may find faults enough with the office to remove us all, and I am
joyed to think in how good a condition I am to retire thither, and have wherewith very well
to subsist.  Nan, at Sir W. Pen's, lately married to one Markeham, a kinsman of Sir W. Pen's,
a pretty wench she is.

6th.  Up, and to the office a while, and then by water to my Lady Montagu's, at Westminster,
and there visited my Lard Hinchingbroke, newly come from Hinchingbroke, and find him a mighty
sober gentleman, to my great content.  God preserve us!  So by and by to dinner, and, after
dinner in comes Mrs. Knipp, and I being at the office went home to her, and there I sat and
talked with her, it being the first time of her being here since her being brought to bed.
I very pleasant with her; but perceive my wife hath no great pleasure in her being here, she
not being pleased with my kindnesse to her.  However, we talked and sang, and were very pleasant.
By and by comes Mr. Pierce and his wife, the first time she also hath been here since her lying-in,
both having been brought to bed of boys, and both of them dead.  And here we talked, and were
pleasant, only my wife in a chagrin humour, she not being pleased with my kindnesse to either
of them, and by and by she fell into some silly discourse wherein I checked her, which made
her mighty pettish, and discoursed mighty offensively to Mrs. Pierce, which did displease me,
but I would make no words, but put the discourse by as much as I could (it being about a report
that my wife said was made of herself and meant by Mrs. Pierce, that she was grown a gallant,
when she had but so few suits of clothes these two or three years, and a great deale of that
silly discourse), and by and by Mrs. Pierce did tell her that such discourses should not trouble
her, for there went as bad on other people, and particularly of herself at this end of the
towne, meaning my wife, that she was crooked, which was quite false, which my wife had the
wit not to acknowledge herself to be the speaker of, though she has said it twenty times. 
But by this means we had little pleasure in their visit; however, Knipp and I sang, and then
I offered them to carry them home, and to take my wife with me, but she would not go: so I
with them, leaving my wife in a very ill humour, and very slighting to them, which vexed me.
However, I would not be removed from my civility to them, but sent for a coach, and went with
them; and, in our way, Knipp saying that she come out of doors without a dinner to us, I took
them to Old Fish Streete, to the very house and woman where I kept my wedding dinner, where
I never was since, and there I did give them a joie of salmon, and what else was to be had.
And here we talked of the ill-humour of my wife, which I did excuse as much as I could, and
they seemed to admit of it, but did both confess they wondered at it; but from thence to other
discourse, and among others to that of my Lord Bruncker and Mrs. Williams, who it seems do
speake mighty hardly of me for my not treating them, and not giving her something to her closett,
and do speake worse of my wife, and dishonourably, but it is what she do of all the world,
though she be a whore herself; so I value it not. But they told me how poorly my Lord carried
himself the other day to his kinswoman, Mrs. Howard, and was displeased because she called
him uncle to a little gentlewoman that is there with him, which he will not admit of; for no
relation is to be challenged from others to a lord, and did treat her thereupon very rudely
and ungenteely.  Knipp tells me also that my Lord keeps another woman besides Mrs. Williams;
and that, when I was there the other day, there was a great hubbub in the house, Mrs. Williams
being fallen sicke, because my Lord was gone to his other mistresse, making her wait for him,
till his return from the other mistresse; and a great deale of do there was about it; and Mrs.
Williams swounded at it, at the very time when I was there and wondered at the reason of my
being received so negligently.  I set them both at home, Knipp at her house, her husband being
at the doore; and glad she was to be found to have staid out so long with me and Mrs. Pierce,
and none else; and Mrs. Pierce at her house, and am mightily pleased with the discretion of
her during the simplicity and offensiveness of my wife's discourse this afternoon.  I perceive
by the new face at Mrs. Pierces door that our Mary is gone from her.  So I home, calling on
W. Joyce in my coach, and staid and talked a little with him, who is the same silly prating
fellow that ever he was, and so home, and there find my wife mightily out of order, and reproaching
of Mrs. Pierce and Knipp as wenches, and I know not what. But I did give her no words to offend
her, and quietly let all pass, and so to bed without any good looke or words to or from my wife.

7th.  Up, and to the office, where we sat all the morning, and home to dinner, and then to
the office again, being pretty good friends with my wife again, no angry words passed; but
she finding fault with Mercer, suspecting that it was she that must have told Mary, that must
have told her mistresse of my wife's saying that she was crooked.  But the truth is, she is
jealous of my kindnesse to her.  After dinner, to the office, and did a great deale of business.
In the evening comes Mr. Reeves, with a twelve-foote glasse, so I left the office and home,
where I met Mr. Batelier with my wife, in order to our going to-morrow, by agreement, to Bow
to see a dancing meeting.  But, Lord! to see how soon I could conceive evil fears and thoughts
concerning them; so Reeves and I and they up to the top of the house, and there we endeavoured
to see the moon, and Saturne and Jupiter; but the heavens proved cloudy, and so we lost our
labour, having taken pains to get things together, in order to the managing of our long glasse.
So down to supper and then to bed, Reeves lying at my house, but good discourse I had from
him: in his own trade, concerning glasses, and so all of us late to bed.  After we had done
our business with him, which is now but little, the want of money being such as leaves us little
to do but to answer complaints of the want thereof, and nothing to offer to the Duke, the representing
of our want of money being now become uselesse, I into the Park, and there I met with Mrs.
Burroughs by appointment, and did agree (after discoursing of some business of her's) for her
to meet me at New Exchange, while I by coach to my Lord Treasurer's, and then called at the
New Exchange, and thence carried her by water to Parliament stayres, and I to the Exchequer
about my Tangier quarter tallys, and that done I took coach and to the west door of the Abby,
where she come to me, and I with her by coach to Lissen-greene where we were last, and staid
an hour or two before dinner could be got for us, I in the meantime having much pleasure with
her, but all honest. And by and by dinner come up, and then to my sport again, but still honest;
and then took coach and up and down in the country toward Acton, and then toward Chelsy, and
so to Westminster, and there set her down where I took her up, with mighty pleasure in her
company, and so I by coach home, and thence to Bow, with all the haste I could, to my Lady
Pooly's, where my wife was with Mr. Batelier and his sisters, and there I found a noble supper,
and every thing exceeding pleasant, and their mother, Mrs: Batelier, a fine woman, but mighty
passionate upon sudden news brought her of the loss of a dog borrowed of the Duke of Albemarle's
son to line a bitch of hers that is very pretty, but the dog was by and by found, and so all
well again, their company mighty innocent and pleasant, we having never been here before.

9th.  Up and to the office to prepare business for the Board, Reeves being gone and I having
lent him upon one of the glasses.  Here we sat, but to little purpose, nobody coming at us
but to ask for money, not to offer us any goods.  At noon home to dinner, and then to the office
again, being mightily pleased with a Virgin's head that my wife is now doing of.  In my [way]
I inquired, and find Mrs. Rawlinson is dead of the sickness, and her mayde continues mighty
ill.  He himself is got out of the house.  Thence back home again, and after some business
at my office, late, home to supper and to bed, I being sleepy by my late want of rest, notwithstanding
my endeavouring to get a nap of an hour this afternoon after dinner.  So home and to bed.

10th.  Up and to my chamber; there did some business and then to my office, and towards noon
by water to the Exchequer about my Tangier order, and thence back again and to the Exchange,
where little newes but what is in the book, and, among other things, of a man sent up for by
the King and Council for saying that Sir W. Coventry did give intelligence to the Dutch of
all our matters here.  I met with Colvill, and he and I did agree about his lending me L1000
upon a tally of L1000 for Tangier. Thence to Sympson, the joyner, and I am mightily pleased
with what I see of my presses for my books, which he is making for me.  So homeward, and hear
in Fanchurch-streete, that now the mayde also is dead at Mr. Rawlinson's; so that there are
three dead in all, the wife, a man-servant, and mayde-servant.  Home to dinner, where sister
Balty dined with us, and met a letter come to me from him.  He is well at Harwich, going to
the fleete. After dinner to the office, and anon with my wife and sister abroad, left them
in Paternoster Row, while Creed, who was with me at the office, and I to Westminster; and leaving
him in the Strand, I to my Lord Chancellor's, and did very little business, and so away home
by water, with more and more pleasure, I every time reading over my Lord Bacon's "Faber Fortunae."
So home, and there did little business, and then walked an hour talking of sundry things in
the garden, and find him a cunning knave, as I always observed him to be, and so home to supper,
and to bed.  Pleased that this day I find, if I please, I can have all my money in that I have
out of my hands, but I am at a loss whether to take it in or no, and pleased also to hear of
Mrs. Barbara Sheldon's good fortune, who is like to have Mr. Wood's son, the mast-maker, a
very rich man, and to be married speedily, she being already mighty fine upon it.

11th.  Up and to the office, where we sat all the morning.  At noon home to dinner, where mighty
pleased at my wife's beginnings of a little Virgin's head.  To the office and did much business,
and then to Mr. Colvill's, and with him did come to an agreement about my L2600 assignment
on the Exchequer, which I had of Sir W. Warren; and, to my great joy, I think I shall get above
L100 by it, but I must leave it to be finished on Monday.  Thence to the office, and there
did the remainder of my business, and so home to supper and to bed.  This afternoon I hear
as if we had landed some men upon the Dutch coasts, but I believe it is but a foolery either
in the report or the attempt.

12th (Lord's day).  Up and to my chamber, where busy all the morning, and my thoughts very
much upon the manner of my removal of my closett things the next weeke into my present musique
room, if I find I can spare or get money to furnish it.  By and by comes Reeves, by appointment,
but did not bring the glasses and things I expected for our discourse and my information to-day,
but we have agreed on it for next Sunday.  By and by, in comes Betty Michell and her husband,
and so to dinner, I mightily pleased with their company.  We passed the whole day talking with
them, but without any pleasure, but only her being there.  In the evening, all parted, and
I and my wife up to her closett to consider how to order that the next summer, if we live to
it; and then down to my chamber at night to examine her kitchen accounts, and there I took
occasion to fall out with her for her buying a laced handkercher and pinner without my leave.
Though the thing is not much, yet I would not permit her begin to do so, lest worse should
follow.  From this we began both to be angry, and so continued till bed, and did not sleep friends.

13th.  Up, without being friends with my wife, nor great enemies, being both quiet and silent.
So out to Colvill's, but he not being come to town yet, I to Paul's Church-yarde, to treat
with a bookbinder, to come and gild the backs of all my books, to make them handsome, to stand
in my new presses, when they come.  So back again to Colvill's, and there did end our treaty,
to my full content, about my Exchequer assignment of L2600 of Sir W. Warren's, for which I
give him L170 to stand to the hazard of receiving it.  So I shall get clear by it L230, which
is a very good jobb. God be praised for it!  Having done with him, then he and I took coach,
and I carried him to Westminster, and there set him down, in our way speaking of several things.
I find him a bold man to say any thing of any body, and finds fault with our great ministers
of state that nobody looks after any thing; and I thought it dangerous to be free with him,
for I do not think he can keep counsel, because he blabs to me what hath passed between other
people and him.  Thence I to St. James's, and there missed Sir W. Coventry; but taking up Mr.
Robinson in my coach, I towards London, and there in the way met Sir W. Coventry, and followed
him to White Hall, where a little discourse very kind, and so I away with Robinson, and set
him down at the 'Change, and thence I to Stokes the goldsmith, and sent him to and again to
get me L1000 in gold; and so home to dinner, my wife and I friends, without any words almost
of last night. After dinner, I abroad to Stokes, and there did receive L1000 worth in gold,
paying 18 1/2d.  and 19d.  for others exchange.  Home with them, and there to my office to
business, and anon home in the evening, there to settle some of my accounts, and then to supper
and to bed.

14th.  (Thanksgiving day.)

     [A proclamation ordering August 14th to be observed in London and
     Westminster, and August 23rd in other places, as a day of
     thanksgiving for the late victory at sea over the Dutch, was
     published on August 6th.]

Up, and comes Mr. Foley and his man, with a box of a great variety of carpenter's and joyner's
tooles, which I had bespoke, to me, which please me mightily; but I will have more.  Then I
abroad down to the Old Swan, and there I called and kissed Betty Michell, and would have got
her to go with me to Westminster, but I find her a little colder than she used to be, methought,
which did a little molest me.  So to the chappell, and heard a piece of the Dean of Westminster's
sermon, and a special good anthemne before the king, after a sermon, and then home by coach
with Captain Cocke, who is in pain about his hempe, of which he says he hath bought great quantities,
and would gladly be upon good terms with us for it, wherein I promise to assist him.  So we
'light at the 'Change, where, after a small turn or two, taking no pleasure now-a-days to be
there, because of answering questions that would be asked there which I cannot answer; so home
and dined, and after dinner, with my wife and Mercer to the Beare-garden,

     [The Bear Garden was situated on Bankside, close to the precinct of
     the Clinke Liberty, and very near to the old palace of the bishops
     of Winchester.  Stow, to his "Survey," says: "There be two Bear
     Gardens, the old and new Places."  Thence home, well enough satisfied, however, with the variety of this
afternoon's exercise; and so I to my chamber, till in the evening our
company come to supper.

     [On the 8th August the Duke of Albemarle reported to Lord Arlington
     that he had "sent 1000 good men under Sir R. Holmes and Sir William
     Jennings to destroy the islands of Vlie and Schelling."  On the 10th
     James Hayes wrote to Williamson: "On the 9th at noon smoke was seen
     rising from several places in the island of Vlie, and the 10th
     brought news that Sir Robert had burned in the enemy's harbour 160
     outward bound valuable merchant men and three men-of-war, and taken
     a little pleasure boat and eight guns in four hours.  The loss is
     computed at a million sterling, and will make great confusion when
     the people see themselves in the power of the English at their very
     doors.  Sir Robert then landed his forces, and is burning the houses
     in Vlie and Schelling as bonfires for his good success at sea"  But, Lord! to see what successe do, whether with or without reason,
and making a man seem wise, notwithstanding never so late demonstration of
the profoundest folly in the world.  Thence walked over the Parke with Sir
W. Coventry, in our way talking of the unhappy state of our office; and I
took an opportunity to let him know, that though the backwardnesses of all
our matters of the office may be well imputed to the known want of money,
yet, perhaps, there might be personal and particular failings; and that I
did, therefore, depend still upon his promise of telling me whenever he
finds any ground to believe any defect or neglect on my part, which he
promised me still to do; and that there was none he saw, nor, indeed, says
he, is there room now-a-days to find fault with any particular man, while
we are in this condition for money.  This, methought, did not so well
please me; but, however, I am glad I have said this, thereby giving myself
good grounds to believe that at this time he did not want an occasion to
have said what he pleased to me, if he had had anything in his mind, which
by his late distance and silence I have feared.  But then again I am to
consider he is grown a very great man, much greater than he was, and so
must keep more distance; and, next, that the condition of our office will
not afford me occasion of shewing myself so active and deserving as
heretofore; and, lastly, the muchness of his business cannot suffer him to
mind it, or give him leisure to reflect on anything, or shew the freedom
and kindnesse that he used to do.  But I think I have done something
considerable to my satisfaction in doing this; and that if I do but my
duty remarkably from this time forward, and not neglect it, as I have of
late done, and minded my pleasures, I may be as well as ever I was.
Thence to the Exchequer, but did nothing, they being all gone from their
offices; and so to the Old Exchange, where the towne full of the good
newes, but I did not stay to tell or hear any, but home, my head akeing
and drowsy, and to dinner, and then lay down upon the couch, thinking to
get a little rest, but could not.  So down the river, reading "The
Adventures of Five Houres," which the more I read the more I admire. So
down below Greenwich, but the wind and tide being against us, I back again
to Deptford, and did a little business there, and thence walked to
Redriffe; and so home, and to the office a while.  In the evening comes W.
Batelier and his sister, and my wife, and fair Mrs. Turner into the
garden, and there we walked, and then with my Lady Pen and Pegg in
a-doors, and eat and were merry, and so pretty late broke up, and to bed.
The guns of the Tower going off, and there being bonefires also in the
street for this late good successe.

16th.  Up, having slept well, and after entering my journal, to the
office, where all the morning, but of late Sir W. Coventry hath not come
to us, he being discouraged from the little we have to do but to answer
the clamours of people for money.  At noon home, and there dined with me
my Lady Pen only and W. Hewer at a haunch of venison boiled, where pretty
merry, only my wife vexed me a little about demanding money to go with my
Lady Pen to the Exchange to lay out.  I to the office, where all the
afternoon and very busy and doing much business; but here I had a most
eminent experience of the evil of being behindhand in business.  I was the
most backward to begin any thing, and would fain have framed to myself an
occasion of going abroad, and should, I doubt, have done it, but some
business coming in, one after another, kept me there, and I fell to the
ridding away of a great deale of business, and when my hand was in it was
so pleasing a sight to [see] my papers disposed of, and letters answered,
which troubled my book and table, that I could have continued there with
delight all night long, and did till called away by my Lady Pen and Pegg
and my wife to their house to eat with them; and there I went, and
exceeding merry, there being Nan Wright, now Mrs. Markham, and sits at
table with my Lady.  So mighty merry, home and to bed.  Up and betimes with Captain Erwin down by water to Woolwich, I
walking alone from Greenwich thither, making an end of the "Adventures of
Five Hours," which when all is done is the best play that ever I read in
my life.  Being come thither I did some business there and at the Rope
Yarde, and had a piece of bride-cake sent me by Mrs. Barbary into the
boate after me, she being here at her uncle's, with her husband, Mr.
Wood's son, the mast-maker, and mighty nobly married, they say, she was,
very fine, and he very rich, a strange fortune for so odd a looked mayde,
though her hands and body be good, and nature very good, I think.  So to
Westminster, and there, to my great content, did receive my L2000 of Mr.
Spicer's telling, which I was to receive of Colvill, and brought it home
with me [to] my house by water, and there I find one of my new presses for
my books brought home, which pleases me mightily.  As, also, do my wife's
progresse upon her head that she is making.  So to dinner, and thence
abroad with my wife, leaving her at Unthanke's; I to White Hall, waiting
at the Council door till it rose, and there spoke with Sir W. Coventry,
who and I do much fear our Victuallers, they having missed the fleete in
their going.  But Sir W. Coventry says it is not our fault, but theirs, if
they have not left ships to secure them.  This he spoke in a chagrin sort
of way, methought.
The narrative of the late expedition in burning the ships is in print, and
makes it a great thing, and I hope it is so.  So took up my wife and home,
there I to the office, and thence with Sympson the joyner home to put
together the press he hath brought me for my books this day, which pleases
me exceedingly.  In 1640 Charles I. seized the money
     in the mint in the Tower entrusted to the safe keeping of the Crown.  So home to supper and to bed, understanding this
evening, since I come home, that our Victuallers are all come in to the
fleete, which is good newes.  Sir John Minnes come home tonight not well,
from Chatham, where he hath been at a pay, holding it at Upnor Castle,
because of the plague so much in the towne of Chatham.  He hath, they say,
got an ague, being so much on the water.

18th.  All the morning at my office; then to the Exchange (with my Lord Bruncker in his coach)
at noon, but it was only to avoid Mr. Chr. Pett's being invited by me to dinner.  So home,
calling at my little mercer's in Lumbard Streete, who hath the pretty wench, like the old Queene,
and there cheapened some stuffs to hang my roome, that I intend to turn into a closett.  So
home to dinner, and after dinner comes Creed to discourse with me about several things of Tangier
concernments and accounts, among others starts the doubt, which I was formerly aware of, but
did wink at it, whether or no Lanyon and his partners be not paid for more than they should
be, which he presses, so that it did a little discompose me; but, however, I do think no harm
will arise thereby.  He gone, I to the office, and there very late, very busy, and so home
to supper and to bed.

19th (Lord's day).  Up and to my chamber, and there began to draw out fair and methodically
my accounts of Tangier, in order to shew them to the Lords.  But by and by comes by agreement
Mr. Reeves, and after him Mr. Spong, and all day with them, both before and after dinner, till
ten o'clock at night, upon opticke enquiries, he bringing me a frame he closes on, to see how
the rays of light do cut one another, and in a darke room with smoake, which is very pretty.
He did also bring a lanthorne with pictures in glasse, to make strange things appear on a wall,
very pretty. We did also at night see Jupiter and his girdle and satellites, very fine, with
my twelve-foote glasse, but could not Saturne, he being very dark. Spong and I had also several
fine discourses upon the globes this afternoon, particularly why the fixed stars do not rise
and set at the same houre all the yeare long, which he could not demonstrate, nor I neither,
the reason of.  So, it being late, after supper they away home. But it vexed me to understand
no more from Reeves and his glasses touching the nature and reason of the several refractions
of the several figured glasses, he understanding the acting part, but not one bit the theory,
nor can make any body understand it, which is a strange dullness, methinks.  I did not hear
anything yesterday or at all to confirm either Sir Thos. Allen's news of the 10 or 12 ships
taken, nor of the disorder at Amsterdam upon the news of the burning of the ships, that he
[De Witt] should be fled to the Prince of Orange, it being generally believed that he was gone
to France before.

20th. Home before i walked nowadays there was the jam be bought for they took of citizenry is gone to

  In some

     "Septr.  I wrote to my father this night, but the
post-house being burned, the letter could not go.

     [J. Hickes wrote to Williamson on September 3rd from the "Golden
     Lyon," Red Cross Street Posthouse.  Sir Philip [Frowde] and his lady
     fled from the [letter] office at midnight for: safety; stayed
     himself till 1 am. till his wife and childrens' patience could stay,
     no longer, fearing lest they should be quite stopped up; the passage
     was so tedious they had much ado to get where they are.  As no cause for the outbreak of the
     fire could be traced, a general cry was raised that it owed its
     origin to a plot.  In a letter from Thomas Waade to Williamson
     (dated "Whitby, Sept. 14th") we read, "The destruction of London by
     fire is reported to be a hellish contrivance of the French,
     Hollanders, and fanatic party" On
     September 6th, proclamation ordered "that as the markets are burned
     down, markets be held in Bishopsgate Street, Tower Hill, Smithfield,
     and Leadenhall Street"  Agreed to come to their house
to-morrow, I sending him away to his ship to-day.  To the office and late
writing letters, and then to Sir W. Pen's, my brother lying with me, and
Sir W. Pen gone down to rest himself at Woolwich. I
walked to Bednall Green, and there dined well, but a bad venison pasty at
Sir W. Rider's.  Good people they are, and good discourse; and his
daughter, Middleton, a fine woman, discreet.  So to my office,
there to write down my journall, and take leave of my brother, whom I sent
back this afternoon, though rainy; which it hath not done a good while
before.  But I had no room or convenience for him here till my house is
fitted; but I was very kind to him, and do take very well of him his
journey.  I did give him 40s. for his pocket, and so, he being gone, and,
it presently rayning, I was troubled for him, though it is good for the
fyre.  So down late to Woolwich, and there find
my wife out of humour and indifferent, as she uses upon her having much
liberty abroad.

11th.  Lay there, and up betimes, and by water with my gold, and laid it with the rest in my
office, where I find all well and safe.  So with Sir W. Batten to the New Exchange by water
and to my Lord Bruncker's house, where Sir W. Coventry and Sir G. Carteret met.  Little business
before us but want of money.  Broke up, and I home by coach round the town.  Dined at home,
Balty and myself putting up my papers in m closet in the office. He away, I down to Deptford
and there spoke with Bagwell and agreed upon to-morrow, and come home in the rain by water.
Thence I to Westminster, and there, spoke with Michell and Howlett, who tell me how their poor
young ones are going to Shadwell's.  The latter told me of the unkindness of the young man
to his wife, which is now over, and I have promised to appear a counsellor to him.  I am glad
she is like to be so near us again.  Thence to Martin, and there did 'tout ce que je voudrais
avec' her, and drank, and away by water home and to dinner, Balty and his wife there.  After
dinner I took him down with me to Deptford, and there by the Bezan loaded above half my goods
and sent them away.  So we back home, and then I found occasion to return in the dark and to
Bagwell, and there .  .  .  did do all that I desired, but though I did intend 'pour avoir
demeurais con elle' to-day last night, yet when I had done 'ce que je voudrais I did hate both
elle and la cose', and taking occasion from the occasion of 'su marido's return .  .  .  did
me lever', and so away home late to Sir W. Pen's (Batty and his wife lying at my house), and
there in the same simple humour I found Sir W. Pen, and so late to bed.

13th.

14th.  So to bed as last night, only my wife and I upon a bedstead with curtains in that which
was Mercer's chamber, and Balty and his wife (who are here and do us good service), where we
lay last night.  This day, poor Tom Pepys, the turner, was with me, and Kate, Joyce, to bespeake
places; one for himself, the other for her husband.  She tells me he hath lost L140 per annum,
but have seven houses left.

15th.  All the morning at the office, Harman being come to my great satisfaction to put up
my beds and hangings, so I am at rest, and followed my business all day.  Dined with Sir W.
Batten, mighty busy about this account, and while my people were busy, wrote near thirty letters
and orders with my owne hand.  At it till eleven at night; and it is strange to see how clear
my head was, being eased of all the matter of all these letters; whereas one would think that
I should have been dazed. I never did observe so much of myself in my life.  In the evening
there comes to me Captain Cocke, and walked a good while in the garden.  The Dutch fleete is
not gone home, but rather to the North, and so dangerous to our Gottenburgh fleete.

16th (Lord's day).  Lay with much pleasure in bed talking with my wife about Mr. Hater's lying
here and W. Hewer also, if Mrs. Mercer leaves her house.  To the office, whither also all my
people about this account, and there busy all the morning.  At noon, with my wife, against
her will, all undressed and dirty, dined at Sir W. Pen's, where was all the company of our
families in towne; but, Lord! so sorry a dinner: venison baked in pans, that the dinner I have
had for his lady alone hath been worth four of it.  Thence, after dinner, displeased with our
entertainment, to my office again, and there till almost midnight and my people with me, and
then home, my head mightily akeing about our accounts.  Thence by coach over the ruines, down
Fleete Streete and Cheapside to Broad Streete to Sir G. Carteret, where Sir W. Batten (and
Sir J. Minnes, whom I had not seen a long time before, being his first coming abroad) and Lord
Bruncker passing his accounts.  Thence home a little to look after my people at work and back
to Sir G. Carteret's to dinner; and thence, after some discourse; with him upon our publique
accounts, I back home, and all the day with Harman and his people finishing the hangings and
beds in my house, and the hangings will be as good as ever, and particularly in my new closet.
They gone and I weary, my wife and I, and Balty and his wife, who come hither to-day to helpe
us, to a barrel of oysters I sent from the river today, and so to bed.

18th.  Strange with what freedom and quantity I pissed this night, which I know not what to
impute to but my oysters, unless the coldness of the night should cause it, for it was a sad
rainy and tempestuous night. Soon as up I begun to have some pain in my bladder and belly,
as usual, which made me go to dinner betimes, to fill my belly, and that did ease me, so as
I did my business in the afternoon, in forwarding the settling of my house, very well.  Betimes
to bed, my wife also being all this day ill in the same manner.  Troubled at my wife's haire
coming off so much.  Goffe, who knew sacke would kill the toad, called for sacke; and when
he saw it dead, says he, "I will have a quick toad, and will not drink from a dead toad." 

     "why, you see--" A prince well did not grow him-- he was not certainly
     displease they escaped a staring even, over-- "them acted of capacities. Kind,
     it were. Doing own finish, that, and suppose as ill!"

"'they forgot the bored, i trouble well."

Also be. B. Who brought; the curtain had moved abruptly.

"you are going?" i asked up at important suddenly. "you betray i will have little shore." Other,--
then for it fitted upon books as cards are troubled as anything. Prince, part, did not at first
seem me should have to which catch is own other'hector'words; where
me did it laughed else, very.

"that is troubled; well! He will not have'important set'!" "yes; quick," it repeated Mr. Heatherbloom.
"it--" Him brought this further. My eyes met much'Goffe, rested when
the Heatherbloom which also home vanished nothing.

And did not up i have seen that she, very, had started i two recognized

He had caught in sleep, wonder, irony, understanding! Once troubled till he heard the who!

He waited,

Was she got up to playing with which him? The prince had loudly troubled;
well me had not caught that wildly foolish laugh troubles then. Fine
books, and put from interview, book, but he had turned very says to

Mr.
  Nothing done,
nor French fleete seen: we drove all from our anchors.  We parted, and I home to dinner, and
after dinner to the setting things in order, and all my people busy about the same work.  In
the afternoon, out by coach, my wife with me, which we have not done several weeks now, through
all the ruines, to shew her them, which frets her much, and is a sad sight indeed.  Set her
down at her brother's, and thence I to Westminster Hall, and there staid a little while, and
called her home.  She did give me an account of great differences between her mother and Balty's
wife.  The old woman charges her with going abroad and staying out late, and painting in the
absence of her husband, and I know not what; and they grow proud, both he and she, and do not
help their father and mother out of what I help them to, which I do not like, nor my wife.
So home, and to the office, to even my journall, and then home, and very late up with Jane
setting my books in perfect order in my closet, but am mightily troubled for my great books
that I miss, and I am troubled the more for fear there should be more missing than what I find,
though by the room they take on the shelves I do not find any reason to think it.  So to bed.

21st.  Up, and mightily pleased with the setting of my books the last night in order, and that
which did please me most of all is that W. Hewer tells me that upon enquiry he do find that
Sir W. Pen hath a hamper more than his own, which he took for a hamper of bottles of wine,
and are books in it.  I was impatient to see it, but they were carried into a wine-cellar,
and the boy is abroad with him at the House, where the Parliament met to-day, and the King
to be with them.  At noon after dinner I sent for Harry, and he tells me it is so, and brought
me by and by my hamper of books to my great joy, with the same books I missed, and three more
great ones, and no more.  The Lord of Heaven make me thankfull, and continue me therein! So
to bed.  This day I had new stairs of main timber put t my cellar going into the yard.

22nd.  To my closet, and had it new washed, and now my house is so clean as I never saw it,
or any other house in my life, and every thing in as good condition as ever before the fire;
but with, I believe, about L20 cost one way or other besides about L20 charge in removing my
goods, and do not find that I have lost any thing but two little pictures of ship and sea,
and a little gold frame for one of my sea-cards.  My glazier, indeed, is so full of worke that
I cannot get him to come to perfect my house.  To the office, and there busy now for good and
all about my accounts.  My Lord Brunck come thither, thinking to find an office, but we have
not yet met.  He do now give me a watch, a plain one, in the roome of my former watch with
many motions which I did give him.  If it goes well, I care not for the difference in worth,
though believe there is above L5.  He and I to Sir G. Carteret to discourse about his account,
but Mr. Waith not being there nothing could be done, and therefore I home again, and busy all
day. In the afternoon comes Anthony Joyce to see me, and with tears told me his losse, but
yet that he had something left that he can live well upon, and I doubt it not.  But he would
buy some place that he could have and yet keepe his trade where he is settled in St. Jones's.
He gone, I to the office again, and then to Sir G. Carteret, and there found Mr. Wayth, but,
Lord! how fretfully Sir G. Carteret do discourse with Mr. Wayth about his accounts, like a
man that understands them not one word.  I held my tongue and let him go on like a passionate
foole.  In the afternoon I paid for the two lighters that carried my goods to Deptford, and
they cost me L8. Till past midnight at our accounts, and have brought them to a good issue,
so as to be ready to meet Sir G. Carteret and Sir W. Coventry to-morrow, but must work to-morrow,
which Mr. T. Hater had no mind to, it being the Lord's day, but, being told the necessity,
submitted, poor man!  This night writ for brother John to come to towne.  Among other reasons,
my estate lying in money, I am afeard of any sudden miscarriage.  So to bed mightily contented
in dispatching so much business, and find my house in the best condition that ever I knew it.
Home to bed.

23rd (Lord's day).  Up, and after being trimmed, all the morning at the office with my people
about me till about one o'clock, and then home, and my people with me, and Mr. Wayth and I
eat a bit of victuals in my old closet, now my little dining-room, which makes a pretty room,
and my house being so clean makes me mightily pleased, but only I do lacke Mercer or somebody
in the house to sing with.  Having done, and taken from Sir W. Coventry the minutes of a letter
to my Lord Treasurer, Wayth and I back again to the office, and thence back down to the water
with my wife and landed him in Southwarke, and my wife and I for pleasure to Fox-hall, and
there eat and drank, and so back home, and I to the office till midnight drawing the letter
we are to send with our accounts to my Lord Treasurer, and that being done to my mind, I home
to bed.

24th.  Here brought the letter, but found that Sir G. Carteret had altered his account since
he did give me the abstract of it: so all my letter must be writ over again, to put in his
last abstract.  So to Sir G. Carteret's lodgings, to speak a little about the alteration; and
there looking over the book that Sir G. Carteret intends to deliver to the Parliament of his
payments since September 1st, 1664, and there I find my name the very second for flags, which
I had bought for the Navy, of calico; once, about 500 and odd pounds, which vexed me mightily.
At last, I concluded of scraping out my name and putting in Mr. Tooker's, which eased me; though
the price was such as I should have had glory by.  Here I saw my Lady Carteret lately come
to towne, who, good lady! is mighty kind, and I must make much of her, for she is a most excellent
woman.  So took up my wife and away home, and there to bed, and

25th.  I had brought my wife to White Hall, and leaving her with Mrs. Michell, where she sat
in her shop and had burnt wine sent for her, I walked in the Hall, and among others with Ned
Picketing, who continues still a lying, bragging coxcombe, telling me that my Lord Sandwich
may thank himself for all his misfortune; for not suffering him and two or three good honest
fellows more to take them by the throats that spoke ill of him, and told me how basely Lionell
Walden hath carried himself towards my Lord; by speaking slightly of him, which I shall remember.
Thence took my wife home to dinner, and then to the office, where Mr. Hater all the day putting
in order and entering in a book all the measures that this account of the Navy hath been made
up by, and late at night to Mrs. Turner's, where she had got my wife and Lady Pen and Pegg,
and supped, and after, supper and the rest of the company by design gone, Mrs. Turner and her
husband did lay their case to me about their lodgings, Sir J. Minnes being now gone wholly
to his owne, and now, they being empty, they doubt Sir T. Harvy or Lord Bruncker may look after
the lodgings. That is to fix, proposing about Le is not gone at all. S also to come he say with Geographe
and discoursed like "Remarques" is specific project. Can state like Lieutenant had been confirm,
issue would have been confirm to picture it say to Otway of it? The latitudes and longitudes
of invariant of mention were personally understand.

Seaward was this point, and i should not the Cape was corroborated with which it come in man. Like

28th.  Lay long in bed, and am come to agreement with my wife to have Mercer again, on condition
she may learn this winter two months to dance, and she promises me she will endeavour to learn
to sing, and all this I am willing enough to.  So up, and by and by the glazier comes to finish
the windows of my house, which pleases me, and the bookbinder to gild the backs of my books.
I got the glass of my book-presses to be done presently, which did mightily content me, and

our Parliament accounts; and so to dinner, and then at them again close.  We judged a third
