18. The Divine of the Lord in heaven is love, for the reason that love is receptive of all
things of heaven, such as peace, intelligence, wisdom and happiness. For love is receptive
of each and all things that are in harmony with it; it longs for them, seeks them, and drinks
them in as it were spontaneously, for it desires unceasingly to be enriched and perfected by
them.{1} This, too, man well knows, for with him love searches as it were the stores of his
memory and draws forth all things that are in accord with itself, collecting and arranging
them in and under itself-in itself that they may be its own, and under itself that they may
be its servants; but other things not in accord with it it discards and expels. That there
is present in love every capacity for receiving truths in harmony with itself, and a longing
to conjoin them to itself, has been made clear also by the fact that some who were simple-minded
in the world were taken up into heaven, and yet when they were with the angels they came into
angelic wisdom and heavenly blessedness, and for the reason that they had loved what is good
and true for its own sake, and had implanted it in their life, and had thereby become capacities
for receiving heaven with all that is ineffable there. But those who are in love of self and
of the world have no capacity for receiving what is good and true; they loathe and reject it,
and at its first touch and entrance they flee and associate themselves with those in hell who
are in loves like their own. There were spirits who had doubts about there being such capacities
in heavenly love, and who wished to know whether it were true; whereupon they were let into
a state of heavenly love, whatever opposed being for the time removed, and were brought forward
some distance, where there was an angelic heaven, and from it they talked with me, saying that
they perceived a more interior happiness than they could possibly express in words, and they
lamented greatly that they must return into their former state. Others also were taken up into
heaven; and the higher or more interiorly they were exalted the more of intelligence and wisdom
were they admitted into, such as enabled them to perceive what had before been incomprehensible
to them. From this it is clear that the love that goes forth from the Lord is receptive of
heaven and all things therein.

  {Footnote 1} Innumerable things are contained in love, and love
  gathers to itself all things that are in harmony with it (n.
  2500, 2572, 3078, 3189, 6323, 7490, 7750).

19. That love to the Lord and love towards the neighbor include in themselves all Divine truths
is made evident by what the Lord Himself said of these two loves:

     Thou shalt love thy God with all thy heart and with all
     thy soul. 22:37-40).

"The law and the prophets" are the whole Word, thus all Divine truth.

20. IV. HEAVEN IS DIVIDED INTO TWO KINGDOMS.

As there are infinite varieties in heaven, and no one society nor any one angel is exactly
like any other,{1} there are in heaven general, specific, and particular divisions. The general
division is into two kingdoms, the specific into three heavens, and the particular into innumerable
societies. Each of these will be treated of in what follows. The general division is said to
be into kingdoms, because heaven is called "the kingdom of God."

  {Footnote 1} There is infinite variety, and nowhere any thing
  the same as another (n. 7236, 9002). Also in the heavens there
  is infinite variety (n. 684, 690, 3744, 5598, 7236). Varieties
  in heaven are varieties of good (n. 3744, 4005, 7236, 7833,
  7836, 9002). All societies in the heavens, and all angels in a
  society, are thereby distinguished from each other (n. 690,
  3241, 3519, 3804, 3986, 4067, 4149, 4263, 7236, 7833, 7836).
  Nevertheless they are all made one by love from the Lord (n.
  457, 3986).

21. There are angels that receive more interiorly the Divine that goes forth from the Lord,
and others that receive it less interiorly; the former are called celestial angels, and the
latter spiritual angels. Because of this difference heaven is divided into two kingdoms, one
called the Celestial Kingdom, the other the Spiritual Kingdom.{1}

  {Footnote 1} Heaven as a whole is divided into two kingdoms, a
  celestial kingdom and a spiritual kingdom (n. 3887, 4138). The
  angels of the celestial kingdom receive the Divine of the lord
  in their voluntary part, thus more interiorly than the
  spiritual angels, who receive it in their intellectual part (n.
  5113, 6367, 8521, 9936, 9995, 10124).

22. As the angels that constitute the celestial kingdom receive the Divine of the Lord more
interiorly they are called interior and also higher angels; and for the same reason the heavens
that they constitute are called interior and higher heavens.{1} They are called higher and
lower, because these terms designate what is interior and what is exterior.{2}

  {Footnote 1} The heavens that constitute the celestial kingdom
  are called higher while those that constitute the spiritual
  kingdom are called lower (n. 10068).

  {Footnote 2} Interior things are portrayed by higher things,
  and higher things signify interior things (n. 2148, 3084, 4599,
  5146, 8325).

23. The love in which those are, who are in the celestial kingdom is called celestial love,
and the love in which those are who are in the spiritual kingdom is called spiritual love.
Celestial love is love to the Lord, and spiritual love is love towards the neighbor. And as
all good pertains to love (for good to any one is what he loves) the good also of the other
kingdom is called celestial, and the good of the other spiritual. Evidently, then, the two
kingdoms are distinguished from each other in the same way as good of love to the Lord is distinguished
from good of love towards the neighbor.{1} And as the good of love to the Lord is an interior
good, and that love is interior love, so the celestial angels are interior angels, and are
called higher angels.

  {Footnote 1} The good of the celestial kingdom is good of love
  to the Lord, and the good of the spiritual kingdom is good of
  charity towards the neighbor (n. 3691, 6435, 9468, 9680, 9683,
  9780).

24. The celestial kingdom is called also the Lord's priestly kingdom, and in the Word "His
dwelling-place;" while the spiritual kingdom is called His royal kingdom, and in the Word "His
throne." And from the celestial Divine the Lord in the world was called "Jesus," while from
the spiritual Divine He was called "Christ."

25. The angels in the Lord's celestial kingdom, from their more interior reception of the Divine
of the Lord, far excel in wisdom and glory the angels that are in His spiritual kingdom; for
they are in love to the Lord, and consequently are nearer and more closely conjoined to Him.{1}
These angels are such because they have received and continue to receive Divine truths at once
in their life, and not first in memory and thought, as the spiritual angels do. Consequently
they have Divine truths written in their hearts, and they perceive them, and as it were see
them, in themselves; nor do they ever reason about them whether they are true or not.{2} They
are such as are described in Jeremiah:

     I will put my law in their mind, and will write it in
     their heart. They shall teach no more everyone his friend
     and everyone his brother, saying, Know ye Jehovah. They
     shall know Me, from the least of them even to the greatest
     of them (31:33, 34).

And they are called in Isaiah:

     Taught of Jehovah (54:13).

That the "taught of Jehovah" are those who are taught by the Lord He Himself teaches in John
(6:45, 46).
