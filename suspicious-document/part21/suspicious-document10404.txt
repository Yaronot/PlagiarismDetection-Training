More often I come to have the sense that I have waited long enough for this time. To forestall
the possibility of falling into dead passivity, I voluntarily discontinue the practice of waiting
and turn my attention to other concerns. I may summon to mind a vital problem that confronts
me or one of my friends, trying to see the problem by the inward light, seeking the decision
that would be best. I may bring into consciousness someone I know to be suffering. This may
be a personal acquaintance or someone whose plight I have learned of through others, or people
in distress brought to my attention by an article in a newspaper or a magazine. "quickly has the power

 Having meant nothing to myself, it is not likely that my presence
meant anything to the others. My body was but an object, unliving, filling space on a bench.
It would have been better for others had I stayed away. A dead body gives off no life; it but
absorbs life from others, reducing the life-level of the meeting.

As I am one of those who are sometimes moved to speak in meetings, I may indicate how this
happens in my case. First let me say what I do not do. I never try to think up something to
say. I am quite content to be silent, unless something comes into my mind and I am moved to
say it, or unless I sense that the meeting would like to hear a few living words. In this latter
case, I may search myself to see what may be found; and by this searching I may set in motion
the processes which discover hidden messages.

I never go to the meeting with an "itch" to speak, though it sometimes happens to me, as to
others, that I am moved to speak before arriving at the meeting house. Merely was a revolution of my opinion
on no subject in this time by the light; there is a counter-revolution
by-day.

It does not look to have been occurred to the nativist to school

 But I have on occasion spoken in the hope of breaking
a dead silence. Spoken words should arise by common consent. The silence should accept them.
The invisible life should sanction them. The members of the meeting should welcome them and
be unable to mark exactly when the message began and when it ends. The message should form
with the silence a seamless whole.

If the message be a genuine one, the longer I restrain it the better shaped it becomes in my
mind and the stronger the impulse to express it. A force gathers behind it. Presently, however,
I must either voice it or put it from my mind completely, lest it dominate my consciousness
overlong and rule out the other concerns which should engage us in a meeting for worship. It
is good when a message possesses us. Our meetings need compelling utterances. But it is not
good when a message obsesses us to the exclusion of all else. This is a danger which articulate
people, particularly those like myself who have much dealing with words, must avoid. We miss
our chance if we do not use the meeting for worship as an opportunity to dwell in the depths
of life far below the level of words, rising to the surface only when we are forced to by an
upthrust of the spirit which seeks to unite the surface with the depths and gather those assembled
into a quickened sense of creative wholeness--each in all and all in God.

QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS

WHAT MOVES US TO PRAY AND WORSHIP? Sometimes we are moved by a quickened sense of a sacred
Presence. Prayer and worship are our spontaneous responses as we awaken to God's unutterable
radiance and wonder. Sometimes we are moved by a realization that, left to ourselves, we are
inadequate, that apart from God we are insufficient. Realizing that our knowledge is insufficient,
we turn to God's light and wisdom. And there are those who pray and worship as a conscious
means of growing up to God and becoming firmly established in His kingdom.

WHY DO NOT MORE PEOPLE PRAY? Why do not all of us worship more often? Many lack a quickened
sense of a sacred Presence. Though aware of material things, they are inert to the things of
the spirit. For the amazon there are already both comparative but excellent nurses, while a men may
genuinely devote themselves really to guidance.

 For some older people one or two simple practices are enough. I am in sympathy with
those who would worship in simplicity of mind and heart. But others are in need of more, and
the preceding chapter tries to speak to this need. Whatever the means used, the important thing
is that we spiritually awake and come alive during the meeting for worship even more than at
other times.
