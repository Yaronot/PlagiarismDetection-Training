It was common talk in the neighborhood that when Grandmother Gregg made things too warm for
him in-doors, the good man, her spouse, was wont to stroll out to the front gate and to take
this exalted seat.

Indeed, it was said by a certain Mrs. Frequent, a neighbor of prying proclivities and ungentle
speech, that the deacon's wife sent him there as a punishment for misdemeanors. Furthermore,
this same Mrs. Frequent did even go so far as to watch for the deacon, and when she would see
him laboriously rise and resignedly poise himself upon the narrow area, she would remark:

"Well, I see Grandma Gregg has got the old man punished again. Wonder what he's been up to now?"

Her constant repetition of the unkind charge finally gained for it such credence that the diminutive
figure upon the gate-post became an object of mingled sympathy and mirth in the popular regard.

The old doctor was the friend of a lifetime, and he was sincerely attached to the deacon, and
when he turned his horse's head towards the gate this evening, he felt his heart go out in
sympathy to the old man in durance vile upon his lonely perch.

But he had barely started to the gate when he heard a voice which he recognized as the deacon's,
whereupon he would have hurried away had not his horse committed him to his first impulse by
unequivocally facing the gate.

"I know three's a crowd," he called out cheerily as he presently drew rein, "but I ain't a-goin'
to stay; I jest--Why, where's grandma?" he added, abruptly, seeing the old man alone. "I'm
shore I heard--"

"You jest heerd me a-talkin' to myself, doctor--or not to myself, exactly, neither--that is
to say, when you come up I was addressin' my remarks to this here pill."

"Bill? I don't see no bill." The doctor drew his buggy nearer. He was a little deaf.

"No; I said this pill, doctor. I'm a-holdin' of it here in the pa'm o' my hand, a-studyin'
over it."

"What's she a-dosin' you for now, Enoch?"

The doctor always called the deacon by his first name when he approached him in sympathy. He
did not know it. Neither did the deacon, but he felt the sympathy, and it unlocked the portals
of his heart.

"Well"--the old man's voice softened--"she thinks I stand in need of 'em, of co'se. The fact
is, that yaller-spotted steer run ag'in her clo'esline twice-t to-day--drug the whole week's
washin' onto the ground, an' then tromped on it. She's inside a-renchin' an' a-starchin' of
'em over now. An' right on top o' that, I come in lookin' sort o' puny an' peaked, an' I happened
to choke on a muskitty jest ez I come in, an' she declared she wasn't a-goin' to have a consumpted
man sick on her hands an' a clo'es-destroyin' steer at the same time. An' with that she up
an' wiped her hands on her apron, an' went an' selected this here pill out of a bottle of assorted
sizes, an' instructed me to take it. They never was a thing done mo' delib'rate an' kind--never
on earth. But of co'se you an' she know how it plegs me to take physic. You could mould out
ice-cream in little pill shapes an' it would gag me, even ef 'twas vanilly-flavored. An' so,
when I received it, why, I jest come out here to meditate. You can see it from where you set,
doctor. It's a purty sizeable one, and I'm mighty suspicious of it." 

Dear Gate, i had the honor of writing you was something to the 18th
to October, and both something up the 25th to month.

The first of them was acknowledged the stroll on yours through the
29th. Again letters, being of post-offices, were confined of subjects.
 If it's
quinine, it'll be bitter; an' ef it's soggy an'--"
