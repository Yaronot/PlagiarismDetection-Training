THE

AUTOBIOGRAPHY

OF AN

EX-COLORED MAN

James Weldon Johnson

1912

PREFACE TO THE ORIGINAL EDITION OF 1912

This vivid and startlingly new picture of conditions brought about by the race question in
the United States makes no special plea for the Negro, but shows in a dispassionate, though
sympathetic, manner conditions as they actually exist between the whites and blacks to-day.
Special pleas have already been made for and against the Negro in hundreds of books, but in
these books either his virtues or his vices have been exaggerated. This is because writers,
in nearly every instance, have treated the colored American as a whole; each has taken some
one group of the race to prove his case. Not before has a composite and proportionate presentation
of the entire race, embracing all of its various groups and elements, showing their relations
with each other and to the whites, been made.

It is very likely that the Negroes of the United States have a fairly correct idea of what
the white people of the country think of them, for that opinion has for a long time been and
is still being constantly stated; but they are themselves more or less a sphinx to the whites.
It is curiously interesting and even vitally important to know what are the thoughts of ten
millions of them concerning the people among whom they live. In these pages it is as though
a veil had been drawn aside: the reader is given a view of the inner life of the Negro in America,
is initiated into the "freemasonry," as it were, of the race.

These pages also reveal the unsuspected fact that prejudice against the Negro is exerting a
pressure which, in New York and other large cities where the opportunity is open, is actually
and constantly forcing an unascertainable number of fair-complexioned colored people over into
the white race.

In this book the reader is given a glimpse behind the scenes of this race-drama which is being
here enacted,--he is taken upon an elevation where he can catch a bird's-eye view of the conflict
which is being waged.

The Publishers

I

I know that in writing the following pages I am divulging the great secret of my life, the
secret which for some years I have guarded far more carefully than any of my earthly possessions;
and it is a curious study to me to analyze the motives which prompt me to do it. I feel that
I am led by the same impulse which forces the un-found-out criminal to take somebody into his
confidence, although he knows that the act is likely, even almost certain, to lead to his undoing.
I know that I am playing with fire, and I feel the thrill which accompanies that most fascinating
pastime; and, back of it all, I think I find a sort of savage and diabolical desire to gather
up all the little tragedies of my life, and turn them into a practical joke on society.

And, too, I suffer a vague feeling of unsatisfaction, of regret, of almost remorse, from which
I am seeking relief, and of which I shall speak in the last paragraph of this account.

I was born in a little town of Georgia a few years after the close of the Civil War. I shall
not mention the name of the town, because there are people still living there who could be
connected with this narrative. I have only a faint recollection of the place of my birth. At
times I can close my eyes and call up in a dreamlike way things that seem to have happened
ages ago in some other world. I can see in this half vision a little house--I am quite sure
it was not a large one--I can remember that flowers grew in the front yard, and that around
each bed of flowers was a hedge of vari-colored glass bottles stuck in the ground neck down.
I remember that once, while playing around in the sand, I became curious to know whether or
not the bottles grew as the flowers did, and I proceeded to dig them up to find out; the investigation
brought me a terrific spanking, which indelibly fixed the incident in my mind. I can remember,
too, that behind the house was a shed under which stood two or three wooden wash-tubs. These
tubs were the earliest aversion of my life, for regularly on certain evenings I was plunged
into one of them and scrubbed until my skin ached. I can remember to this day the pain caused
by the strong, rank soap's getting into my eyes.

Back from the house a vegetable garden ran, perhaps seventy-five or one hundred feet; but to
my childish fancy it was an endless territory. I can still recall the thrill of joy, excitement,
and wonder it gave me to go on an exploring expedition through it, to find the blackberries,
both ripe and green, that grew along the edge of the fence.

I remember with what pleasure I used to arrive at, and stand before, a little enclosure in
which stood a patient cow chewing her cud, how I would occasionally offer her through the bars
a piece of my bread and molasses, and how I would jerk back my hand in half fright if she made
any motion to accept my offer.

I have a dim recollection of several people who moved in and about this little house, but I
have a distinct mental image of only two: one, my mother; and the other, a tall man with a
small, dark mustache. I remember that his shoes or boots were always shiny, and that he wore
a gold chain and a great gold watch with which he was always willing to let me play. My admiration
was almost equally divided between the watch and chain and the shoes. He used to come to the
house evenings, perhaps two or three times a week; and it became my appointed duty whenever
he came to bring him a pair of slippers and to put the shiny shoes in a particular corner;
he often gave me in return for this service a bright coin, which my mother taught me to promptly
drop in a little tin bank. I remember distinctly the last time this tall man came to the little
house in Georgia; that evening before I went to bed he took me up in his arms and squeezed
me very tightly; my mother stood behind his chair wiping tears from her eyes. I remember how
I sat upon his knee and watched him laboriously drill a hole through a ten-dollar gold piece,
and then tie the coin around my neck with a string. I have worn that gold piece around my neck
the greater part of my life, and still possess it, but more than once I have wished that some
other way had been found of attaching it to me besides putting a hole through it.

On the day after the coin was put around my neck my mother and I started on what seemed to
me an endless journey. I knelt on the seat and watched through the train window the corn and
cotton fields pass swiftly by until I fell asleep. When I fully awoke, we were being driven
through the streets of a large city--Savannah. I sat up and blinked at the bright lights. At
Savannah we boarded a steamer which finally landed us in New York. From New York we went to
a town in Connecticut, which became the home of my boyhood.

My mother and I lived together in a little cottage which seemed to me to be fitted up almost
luxuriously; there were horse-hair-covered chairs in the parlor, and a little square piano;
there was a stairway with red carpet on it leading to a half second story; there were pictures
on the walls, and a few books in a glass-doored case. My mother dressed me very neatly, and
I developed that pride which well-dressed boys generally have. She was careful about my associates,
and I myself was quite particular. As I look back now I can see that I was a perfect little
aristocrat. My mother rarely went to anyone's house, but she did sewing, and there were a great
many ladies coming to our cottage. If I was around they would generally call me, and ask me
my name and age and tell my mother what a pretty boy I was. Some of them would pat me on the
head and kiss me.

My mother was kept very busy with her sewing; sometimes she would have another woman helping
her. I think she must have derived a fair income from her work. I know, too, that at least
once each month she received a letter; I used to watch for the postman, get the letter, and
run to her with it; whether she was busy or not, she would take it and instantly thrust it
into her bosom. I never saw her read one of these letters. I knew later that they contained
money and what was to her more than money. As busy as she generally was, she found time, however,
to teach me my letters and figures and how to spell a number of easy words. Always on Sunday
evenings she opened the little square piano and picked out hymns. I can recall now that whenever
she played hymns from the book her tempo was always decidedly largo. Sometimes on other evenings,
when she was not sewing, she would play simple accompaniments to some old Southern songs which
she sang. In these songs she was freer, because she played them by ear. Those evenings on which
she opened the little piano were the happiest hours of my childhood. Whenever she started toward
the instrument, I used to follow her with all the interest and irrepressible joy that a pampered
pet dog shows when a package is opened in which he knows there is a sweet bit for him. I used
to stand by her side and often interrupt and annoy her by chiming in with strange harmonies
which I found on either the high keys of the treble or the low keys of the bass. I remember
that I had a particular fondness for the black keys. Always on such evenings, when the music
was over, my mother would sit with me in her arms, often for a very long time. She would hold
me close, softly crooning some old melody without words, all the while gently stroking her
face against my head; many and many a night I thus fell asleep. I can see her now, her great
dark eyes looking into the fire, to where? No one knew but her. The memory of that picture
has more than once kept me from straying too far from the place of purity and safety in which
her arms held me.

At a very early age I began to thump on the piano alone, and it was not long before I was able
to pick out a few tunes. When I was seven years old, I could play by ear all of the hymns and
songs that my mother knew. I had also learned the names of the notes in both clefs, but I preferred
not to be hampered by notes. About this time several ladies for whom my mother sewed heard
me play and they persuaded her that I should at once be put under a teacher; so arrangements
were made for me to study the piano with a lady who was a fairly good musician; at the same
time arrangements were made for me to study my books with this lady's daughter. My music teacher
had no small difficulty at first in pinning me down to the notes. If she played my lesson over
for me, I invariably attempted to reproduce the required sounds without the slightest recourse
to the written characters. Her daughter, my other teacher, also had her worries. She found
that, in reading, whenever I came to words that were difficult or unfamiliar, I was prone to
bring my imagination to the rescue and read from the picture. She has laughingly told me, since
then, that I would sometimes substitute whole sentences and even paragraphs from what meaning
I thought the illustrations conveyed. She said she not only was sometimes amused at the fresh
treatment I would give an author's subject, but, when I gave some new and sudden turn to the
plot of the story, often grew interested and even excited in listening to hear what kind of
a denouement I would bring about. But I am sure this was not due to dullness, for I made rapid
progress in both my music and my books.

And so for a couple of years my life was divided between my music and my school books. Music
took up the greater part of my time. I had no playmates, but amused myself with games--some
of them my own invention--which could be played alone. I knew a few boys whom I had met at
the church which I attended with my mother, but I had formed no close friendships with any
of them. Then, when I was nine years old, my mother decided to enter me in the public school,
so all at once I found myself thrown among a crowd of boys of all sizes and kinds; some of
them seemed to me like savages. I shall never forget the bewilderment, the pain, the heart-sickness,
of that first day at school. I seemed to be the only stranger in the place; every other boy
seemed to know every other boy. I was fortunate enough, however, to be assigned to a teacher
who knew me; my mother made her dresses. She was one of the ladies who used to pat me on the
head and kiss me. She had the tact to address a few words directly to me; this gave me a certain
sort of standing in the class and put me somewhat at ease.

Within a few days I had made one staunch friend and was on fairly good terms with most of the
boys. I was shy of the girls, and remained so; even now a word or look from a pretty woman
sets me all a-tremble. This friend I bound to me with hooks of steel in a very simple way.
He was a big awkward boy with a face full of freckles and a head full of very red hair. He
was perhaps fourteen years of age; that is, four or five years older than any other boy in
the class. This seniority was due to the fact that he had spent twice the required amount of
time in several of the preceding classes. I had not been at school many hours before I felt
that "Red Head"--as I involuntarily called him--and I were to be friends. I do not doubt that
this feeling was strengthened by the fact that I had been quick enough to see that a big, strong
boy was a friend to be desired at a public school; and, perhaps, in spite of his dullness,
"Red Head" had been able to discern that I could be of service to him. At any rate there was
a simultaneous mutual attraction.

The teacher had strung the class promiscuously around the walls of the room for a sort of trial
heat for places of rank; when the line was straightened out, I found that by skillful maneuvering
I had placed myself third and had piloted "Red Head" to the place next to me. The teacher began
by giving us to spell the words corresponding to our order in the line. "Spell first." "Spell
second." "Spell third." I rattled off: "T-h-i-r-d, third," in a way which said: "Why don't
you give us something hard?" As the words went down the line, I could see how lucky I had been
to get a good place together with an easy word. As young as I was, I felt impressed with the
unfairness of the whole proceeding when I saw the tailenders going down before twelfth and
twentieth, and I felt sorry for those who had to spell such words in order to hold a low position.
"Spell fourth." "Red Head," with his hands clutched tightly behind his back, began bravely:
"F-o-r-t-h." Like a flash a score of hands went up, and the teacher began saying: "No snapping
of fingers, no snapping of fingers." This was the first word missed, and it seemed to me that
some of the scholars were about to lose their senses; some were dancing up and down on one
foot with a hand above their heads, the fingers working furiously, and joy beaming all over
their faces; others stood still, their hands raised not so high, their fingers working less
rapidly, and their faces expressing not quite so much happiness; there were still others who
did not move or raise their hands, but stood with great wrinkles on their foreheads, looking
very thoughtful.

The whole thing was new to me, and I did not raise my hand, but slyly whispered the letter
"u" to "Red Head" several times. "Second chance," said the teacher. The hands went down and
the class became quiet. "Red Head," his face now red, after looking beseechingly at the ceiling,
then pitiably at the floor, began very haltingly: "F-u--" Immediately an impulse to raise hands
went through the class, but the teacher checked it, and poor "Red Head," though he knew that
each letter he added only took him farther out of the way, went doggedly on and finished: "--r-t-h."
The hand-raising was now repeated with more hubbub and excitement than at first. Those who
before had not moved a finger were now waving their hands above their heads. "Red Head" felt
that he was lost. He looked very big and foolish, and some of the scholars began to snicker.
His helpless condition went straight to my heart, and gripped my sympathies. I felt that if
he failed, it would in some way be my failure. I raised my hand, and, under cover of the excitement
and the teacher's attempts to regain order, I hurriedly shot up into his ear twice, quite distinctly:
"F-o-u-r-t-h, f-o-u-r-t-h." The teacher tapped on her desk and said: "Third and last chance."
The hands came down, the silence became oppressive. "Red Head" began: "F--" Since that day
I have waited anxiously for many a turn of the wheel of fortune, but never under greater tension
than when I watched for the order in which those letters would fall from "Red's" lips--"o-u-r-t-h."
A sigh of relief and disappointment went up from the class. Afterwards, through all our school
days, "Red Head" shared my wit and quickness and I benefited by his strength and dogged faithfulness.

There were some black and brown boys and girls in the school, and several of them were in my
class. One of the boys strongly attracted my attention from the first day I saw him. His face
was as black as night, but shone as though it were polished; he had sparkling eyes, and when
he opened his mouth, he displayed glistening white teeth. It struck me at once as appropriate
to call him "Shiny Face," or "Shiny Eyes," or "Shiny Teeth," and I spoke of him often by one
of these names to the other boys. These terms were finally merged into "Shiny," and to that
name he answered good-naturedly during the balance of his public school days.

"Shiny" was considered without question to be the best speller, the best reader, the best penman--in
a word, the best scholar, in the class. He was very quick to catch anything, but, nevertheless,
studied hard; thus he possessed two powers very rarely combined in one boy. I saw him year
after year, on up into the high school, win the majority of the prizes for punctuality, deportment,
essay writing, and declamation. Yet it did not take me long to discover that, in spite of his
standing as a scholar, he was in some way looked down upon.

The other black boys and girls were still more looked down upon. Some of the boys often spoke
of them as "niggers." Sometimes on the way home from school a crowd would walk behind them
repeating:

  "Nigger, nigger, never die,
  Black face and shiny eye."

On one such afternoon one of the black boys turned suddenly on his tormentors and hurled a
slate; it struck one of the white boys in the mouth, cutting a slight gash in his lip. At sight
of the blood the boy who had thrown the slate ran, and his companions quickly followed. We
ran after them pelting them with stones until they separated in several directions. I was very
much wrought up over the affair, and went home and told my mother how one of the "niggers"
had struck a boy with a slate. I shall never forget how she turned on me. "Don't you ever use
that word again," she said, "and don't you ever bother the colored children at school. You
ought to be ashamed of yourself." I did hang my head in shame, not because she had convinced
me that I had done wrong, but because I was hurt by the first sharp word she had ever given me.

My school days ran along very pleasantly. I stood well in my studies, not always so well with
regard to my behavior. I was never guilty of any serious misconduct, but my love of fun sometimes
got me into trouble. I remember, however, that my sense of humor was so sly that most of the
trouble usually fell on the head of the other fellow. My ability to play on the piano at school
exercises was looked upon as little short of marvelous in a boy of my age. I was not chummy
with many of my mates, but, on the whole, was about as popular as it is good for a boy to be.

One day near the end of my second term at school the principal came into our room and, after
talking to the teacher, for some reason said: "I wish all of the white scholars to stand for
a moment." I rose with the others. The teacher looked at me and, calling my name, said: "You
sit down for the present, and rise with the others." I did not quite understand her, and questioned:
"Ma'm?" She repeated, with a softer tone in her voice: "You sit down now, and rise with the
others." I sat down dazed. I saw and heard nothing. When the others were asked to rise, I did
not know it. When school was dismissed, I went out in a kind of stupor. A few of the white
boys jeered me, saying: "Oh, you're a nigger too." I heard some black children say: "We knew
he was colored." "Shiny" said to them: "Come along, don't tease him," and thereby won my undying
gratitude. I hurried on as fast as I could, and had gone some distance before I perceived that
"Red Head" was walking by my side. After a while he said to me: "Le' me carry your books."
I gave him my strap without being able to answer. When we got to my gate, he said as he handed
me my books: "Say, you know my big red agate? I can't shoot with it any more. I'm going to
bring it to school for you tomorrow." I took my books and ran into the house. As I passed through
the hallway, I saw that my mother was busy with one of her customers; I rushed up into my own
little room, shut the door, and went quickly to where my looking-glass hung on the wall. For
an instant I was afraid to look, but when I did, I looked long and earnestly. I had often heard
people say to my mother: "What a pretty boy you have!" I was accustomed to hear remarks about
my beauty; but now, for the first time, I became conscious of it and recognized it. I noticed
the ivory whiteness of my skin, the beauty of my mouth, the size and liquid darkness of my
eyes, and how the long, black lashes that fringed and shaded them produced an effect that was
strangely fascinating even to me. I noticed the softness and glossiness of my dark hair that
fell in waves over my temples, making my forehead appear whiter than it really was. How long
I stood there gazing at my image I do not know. When I came out and reached the head of the
stairs, I heard the lady who had been with my mother going out. I ran downstairs and rushed
to where my mother was sitting, with a piece of work in her hands. I buried my head in her
lap and blurted out: "Mother, mother, tell me, am I a nigger?" I could not see her face, but
I knew the piece of work dropped to the floor and I felt her hands on my head. I looked up
into her face and repeated: "Tell me, mother, am I a nigger?" There were tears in her eyes
and I could see that she was suffering for me. And then it was that I looked at her critically
for the first time. I had thought of her in a childish way only as the most beautiful woman
in the world; now I looked at her searching for defects. I could see that her skin was almost
brown, that her hair was not so soft as mine, and that she did differ in some way from the
other ladies who came to the house; yet, even so, I could see that she was very beautiful,
more beautiful than any of them. She must have felt that I was examining her, for she hid her
face in my hair and said with difficulty: "No, my darling, you are not a nigger." She went
on: "You are as good as anybody; if anyone calls you a nigger, don't notice them." But the
more she talked, the less was I reassured, and I stopped her by asking: "Well, mother, am I
white? Are you white?" She answered tremblingly: "No, I am not white, but you--your father
is one of the greatest men in the country--the best blood of the South is in you--" This suddenly
opened up in my heart a fresh chasm of misgiving and fear, and I almost fiercely demanded:
"Who is my father? Where is he?" She stroked my hair and said: "I'll tell you about him some
day." I sobbed: "I want to know now." She answered: "No, not now."

Perhaps it had to be done, but I have never forgiven the woman who did it so cruelly. It may
be that she never knew that she gave me a sword-thrust that day in school which was years in
healing.

II

Since I have grown older I have often gone back and tried to analyze the change that came into
my life after that fateful day in school. There did come a radical change, and, young as I
was, I felt fully conscious of it, though I did not fully comprehend it. Like my first spanking,
it is one of the few incidents in my life that I can remember clearly. In the life of everyone
there is a limited number of unhappy experiences which are not written upon the memory, but
stamped there with a die; and in long years after, they can be called up in detail, and every
emotion that was stirred by them can be lived through anew; these are the tragedies of life.
We may grow to include some of them among the trivial incidents of childhood--a broken toy,
a promise made to us which was not kept, a harsh, heart-piercing word--but these, too, as well
as the bitter experiences and disappointments of mature years, are the tragedies of life.

And so I have often lived through that hour, that day, that week, in which was wrought the
miracle of my transition from one world into another; for I did indeed pass into another world.
From that time I looked out through other eyes, my thoughts were colored, my words dictated,
my actions limited by one dominating, all-pervading idea which constantly increased in force
and weight until I finally realized in it a great, tangible fact.

And this is the dwarfing, warping, distorting influence which operates upon each and every
colored man in the United States. He is forced to take his outlook on all things, not from
the viewpoint of a citizen, or a man, or even a human being, but from the viewpoint of a colored
man. It is wonderful to me that the race has progressed so broadly as it has, since most of
its thought and all of its activity must run through the narrow neck of this one funnel.

And it is this, too, which makes the colored people of this country, in reality, a mystery
to the whites. It is a difficult thing for a white man to learn what a colored man really thinks;
because, generally, with the latter an additional and different light must be brought to bear
on what he thinks; and his thoughts are often influenced by considerations so delicate and
subtle that it would be impossible for him to confess or explain them to one of the opposite
race. This gives to every colored man, in proportion to his intellectuality, a sort of dual
personality; there is one phase of him which is disclosed only in the freemasonry of his own
race. I have often watched with interest and sometimes with amazement even ignorant colored
men under cover of broad grins and minstrel antics maintain this dualism in the presence of
white men.

I believe it to be a fact that the colored people of this country know and understand the white
people better than the white people know and understand them.

I now think that this change which came into my life was at first more subjective than objective.
I do not think my friends at school changed so much toward me as I did toward them. I grew
reserved, I might say suspicious. I grew constantly more and more afraid of laying myself open
to some injury to my feelings or my pride. I frequently saw or fancied some slight where, I
am sure, none was intended. On the other hand, my friends and teachers were, if anything different,
more considerate of me; but I can remember that it was against this very attitude in particular
that my sensitiveness revolted. "Red" was the only one who did not so wound me; up to this
day I recall with a swelling heart his clumsy efforts to make me understand that nothing could
change his love for me.

I am sure that at this time the majority of my white schoolmates did not understand or appreciate
any differences between me and themselves; but there were a few who had evidently received
instructions at home on the matter, and more than once they displayed their knowledge in word
and action. As the years passed, I noticed that the most innocent and ignorant among the others
grew in wisdom.

I myself would not have so clearly understood this difference had it not been for the presence
of the other colored children at school; I had learned what their status was, and now I learned
that theirs was mine. I had had no particular like or dislike for these black and brown boys
and girls; in fact, with the exception of "Shiny," they had occupied very little of my thought;
but I do know that when the blow fell, I had a very strong aversion to being classed with them.
So I became something of a solitary. "Red" and I remained inseparable, and there was between
"Shiny" and me a sort of sympathetic bond, but my intercourse with the others was never entirely
free from a feeling of constraint. I must add, however, that this feeling was confined almost
entirely to my intercourse with boys and girls of about my own age; I did not experience it
with my seniors. And when I grew to manhood, I found myself freer with elderly white people
than with those near my own age.

I was now about eleven years old, but these emotions and impressions which I have just described
could not have been stronger or more distinct at an older age. There were two immediate results
of my forced loneliness: I began to find company in books, and greater pleasure in music. I
made the former discovery through a big, gilt-bound, illustrated copy of the Bible, which used
to lie in splendid neglect on the center table in our little parlor. On top of the Bible lay
a photograph album. I had often looked at the pictures in the album, and one day, after taking
the larger book down and opening it on the floor, I was overjoyed to find that it contained
what seemed to be an inexhaustible supply of pictures. I looked at these pictures many times;
in fact, so often that I knew the story of each one without having to read the subject, and
then, somehow, I picked up the thread of history on which are strung the trials and tribulations
of the Hebrew children; this I followed with feverish interest and excitement. For a long time
King David, with Samson a close second, stood at the head of my list of heroes; he was not
displaced until I came to know Robert the Bruce. I read a good portion of the Old Testament,
all that part treating of wars and rumors of wars, and then started in on the New. I became
interested in the life of Christ, but became impatient and disappointed when I found that,
notwithstanding the great power he possessed, he did not make use of it when, in my judgment,
he most needed to do so. And so my first general impression of the Bible was what my later
impression has been of a number of modern books, that the authors put their best work in the
first part, and grew either exhausted or careless toward the end.

After reading the Bible, or those parts which held my attention, I began to explore the glass-doored
bookcase which I have already mentioned. I found there Pilgrim's Progress, Peter Parley's History
of the United States, Grimm's Household Stories, Tales of a Grandfather, a bound volume of
an old English publication (I think it was called The Mirror), a little volume called Familiar
Science, and somebody's Natural Theology, which last, of course, I could not read, but which,
nevertheless, I tackled, with the result of gaining a permanent dislike for all kinds of theology.
There were several other books of no particular name or merit, such as agents sell to people
who know nothing of buying books. How my mother came by this little library which, considering
all things, was so well suited to me I never sought to know. But she was far from being an
ignorant woman and had herself, very likely, read the majority of these books, though I do
not remember ever seeing her with a book in her hand, with the exception of the Episcopal Prayer
book. At any rate she encouraged in me the habit of reading, and when I had about exhausted
those books in the little library which interested me, she began to buy books for me. She also
regularly gave me money to buy a weekly paper which was then very popular for boys.

At this time I went in for music with an earnestness worthy of maturer years; a change of teachers
was largely responsible for this. I began now to take lessons of the organist of the church
which I attended with my mother; he was a good teacher and quite a thorough musician. He was
so skillful in his instruction and filled me with such enthusiasm that my progress--these are
his words--was marvelous. I remember that when I was barely twelve years old I appeared on
a program with a number of adults at an entertainment given for some charitable purpose, and
carried off the honors. I did more, I brought upon myself through the local newspapers the
handicapping title of "infant prodigy."

I can believe that I did astonish my audience, for I never played the piano like a child; that
is, in the "one-two-three" style with accelerated motion. Neither did I depend upon mere brilliancy
of technique, a trick by which children often surprise their listeners; but I always tried
to interpret a piece of music; I always played with feeling. Very early I acquired that knack
of using the pedals, which makes the piano a sympathetic, singing instrument, quite a different
thing from the source of hard or blurred sounds it so generally is. I think this was due not
entirely to natural artistic temperament, but largely to the fact that I did not begin to learn
the piano by counting out exercises, but by trying to reproduce the quaint songs which my mother
used to sing, with all their pathetic turns and cadences.

Even at a tender age, in playing I helped to express what I felt by some of the mannerisms
which I afterwards observed in great performers; I had not copied them. I have often heard
people speak of the mannerisms of musicians as affectations adopted for mere effect; in some
cases they may be so; but a true artist can no more play upon the piano or violin without putting
his whole body in accord with the emotions he is striving to express than a swallow can fly
without being graceful. Often when playing I could not keep the tears which formed in my eyes
from rolling down my cheeks. Sometimes at the end or even in the midst of a composition, as
big a boy as I was, I would jump from the piano, and throw myself sobbing into my mother's
arms. She, by her caresses and often her tears, only encouraged these fits of sentimental hysteria.
Of course, to counteract this tendency to temperamental excesses I should have been out playing
ball or in swimming with other boys of my age; but my mother didn't know that. There was only
once when she was really firm with me, making me do what she considered was best; I did not
want to return to school after the unpleasant episode which I have related, and she was inflexible.

I began my third term, and the days ran along as I have already indicated. I had been promoted
twice, and had managed each time to pull "Red" along with me. I think the teachers came to
consider me the only hope of his ever getting through school, and I believe they secretly conspired
with me to bring about the desired end. At any rate, I know it became easier in each succeeding
examination for me not only to assist "Red," but absolutely to do his work. It is strange how
in some things honest people can be dishonest without the slightest compunction. I knew boys
at school who were too honorable to tell a fib even when one would have been just the right
thing, but could not resist the temptation to assist or receive assistance in an examination.
I have long considered it the highest proof of honesty in a man to hand his street-car fare
to the conductor who had overlooked it.

One afternoon after school, during my third term, I rushed home in a great hurry to get my
dinner and go to my music teacher's. I was never reluctant about going there, but on this particular
afternoon I was impetuous. The reason of this was I had been asked to play the accompaniment
for a young lady who was to play a violin solo at a concert given by the young people of the
church, and on this afternoon we were to have our first rehearsal. At that time playing accompaniments
was the only thing in music I did not enjoy; later this feeling grew into positive dislike.
I have never been a really good accompanist because my ideas of interpretation were always
too strongly individual. I constantly forced my accelerandos and rubatos upon the soloist,
often throwing the duet entirely out of gear.

Perhaps the reader has already guessed why I was so willing and anxious to play the accompaniment
to this violin solo; if not--the violinist was a girl of seventeen or eighteen whom I had first
heard play a short time before on a Sunday afternoon at a special service of some kind, and
who had moved me to a degree which now I can hardly think of as possible. At present I do not
think it was due to her wonderful playing, though I judge she must have been a very fair performer,
but there was just the proper setting to produce the effect upon a boy such as I was; the half-dim
church, the air of devotion on the part of the listeners, the heaving tremor of the organ under
the clear wail of the violin, and she, her eyes almost closing, the escaping strands of her
dark hair wildly framing her pale face, and her slender body swaying to the tones she called
forth, all combined to fire my imagination and my heart with a passion, though boyish, yet
strong and, somehow, lasting. I have tried to describe the scene; if I have succeeded, it is
only half success, for words can only partially express what I wish to convey. Always in recalling
that Sunday afternoon I am sub-conscious of a faint but distinct fragrance which, like some
old memory-awakening perfume, rises and suffuses my whole imagination, inducing a state of
reverie so airy as just to evade the powers of expression.

She was my first love, and I loved her as only a boy loves. I dreamed of her, I built air castles
for her, she was the incarnation of each beautiful heroine I knew; when I played the piano,
it was to her, not even music furnished an adequate outlet for my passion; I bought a new note-book
and, to sing her praises, made my first and last attempts at poetry. I remember one day at
school, after we had given in our notebooks to have some exercises corrected, the teacher called
me to her desk and said: "I couldn't correct your exercises because I found nothing in your
book but a rhapsody on somebody's brown eyes." I had passed in the wrong note-book. I don't
think I have felt greater embarrassment in my whole life than I did at that moment. I was ashamed
not only that my teacher should see this nakedness of my heart, but that she should find out
that I had any knowledge of such affairs. It did not then occur to me to be ashamed of the
kind of poetry I had written.

Of course, the reader must know that all of this adoration was in secret; next to my great
love for this young lady was the dread that in some way she would find it out. I did not know
what some men never find out, that the woman who cannot discern when she is loved has never
lived. It makes me laugh to think how successful I was in concealing it all; within a short
time after our duet all of the friends of my dear one were referring to me as her "little sweetheart,"
or her "little beau," and she laughingly encouraged it. This did not entirely satisfy me; I
wanted to be taken seriously. I had definitely made up my mind that I should never love another
woman, and that if she deceived me I should do something desperate--the great difficulty was
to think of something sufficiently desperate--and the heartless jade, how she led me on!

So I hurried home that afternoon, humming snatches of the violin part of the duet, my heart
beating with pleasurable excitement over the fact that I was going to be near her, to have
her attention placed directly upon me; that I was going to be of service to her, and in a way
in which I could show myself to advantage--this last consideration has much to do with cheerful
service----. The anticipation produced in me a sensation somewhat between bliss and fear. I
rushed through the gate, took the three steps to the house at one bound, threw open the door,
and was about to hang my cap on its accustomed peg of the hall rack when I noticed that that
particular peg was occupied by a black derby hat. I stopped suddenly and gazed at this hat
as though I had never seen an object of its description. I was still looking at it in open-eyed
wonder when my mother, coming out of the parlor into the hallway, called me and said there
was someone inside who wanted to see me. Feeling that I was being made a party to some kind
of mystery, I went in with her, and there I saw a man standing leaning with one elbow on the
mantel, his back partly turned toward the door. As I entered, he turned and I saw a tall, handsome,
well-dressed gentleman of perhaps thirty-five; he advanced a step toward me with a smile on
his face. I stopped and looked at him with the same feelings with which I had looked at the
derby hat, except that they were greatly magnified. I looked at him from head to foot, but
he was an absolute blank to me until my eyes rested on his slender, elegant polished shoes;
then it seemed that indistinct and partly obliterated films of memory began, at first slowly,
then rapidly, to unroll, forming a vague panorama of my childhood days in Georgia.

My mother broke the spell by calling me by name and saying: "This is your father."

"Father, father," that was the word which had been to me a source of doubt and perplexity ever
since the interview with my mother on the subject. How often I had wondered about my father,
who he was, what he was like, whether alive or dead, and, above all, why she would not tell
me about him. More than once I had been on the point of recalling to her the promise she had
made me, but I instinctively felt that she was happier for not telling me and that I was happier
for not being told; yet I had not the slightest idea what the real truth was. And here he stood
before me, just the kind of looking father I had wishfully pictured him to be; but I made no
advance toward him; I stood there feeling embarrassed and foolish, not knowing what to say
or do. I am not sure but that he felt pretty much the same. My mother stood at my side with
one hand on my shoulder, almost pushing me forward, but I did not move. I can well remember
the look of disappointment, even pain, on her face; and I can now understand that she could
expect nothing else but that at the name "father" I should throw myself into his arms. But
I could not rise to this dramatic, or, better, melodramatic, climax. Somehow I could not arouse
any considerable feeling of need for a father. He broke the awkward tableau by saying: "Well,
boy, aren't you glad to see me?" He evidently meant the words kindly enough, but I don't know
what he could have said that would have had a worse effect; however, my good breeding came
to my rescue, and I answered: "Yes, sir," and went to him and offered him my hand. He took
my hand into one of his, and, with the other, stroked my head, saying that I had grown into
a fine youngster. He asked me how old I was; which, of course, he must have done merely to
say something more, or perhaps he did so as a test of my intelligence. I replied: "Twelve,
sir." He then made the trite observation about the flight of time, and we lapsed into another
awkward pause.

My mother was all in smiles; I believe that was one of the happiest moments of her life. Either
to put me more at ease or to show me off, she asked me to play something for my father. There
is only one thing in the world that can make music, at all times and under all circumstances,
up to its general standard; that is a hand-organ, or one of its variations. I went to the piano
and played something in a listless, half-hearted way. I simply was not in the mood. I was wondering,
while playing, when my mother would dismiss me and let me go; but my father was so enthusiastic
in his praise that he touched my vanity--which was great--and more than that; he displayed
that sincere appreciation which always arouses an artist to his best effort, and, too, in an
unexplainable manner, makes him feel like shedding tears. I showed my gratitude by playing
for him a Chopin waltz with all the feeling that was in me. When I had finished, my mother's
eyes were glistening with tears; my father stepped across the room, seized me in his arms,
and squeezed me to his breast. I am certain that for that moment he was proud to be my father.
He sat and held me standing between his knees while he talked to my mother. I, in the mean
time, examined him with more curiosity, perhaps, than politeness. I interrupted the conversation
by asking: "Mother, is he going to stay with us now?" I found it impossible to frame the word
"father"; it was too new to me; so I asked the question through my mother. Without waiting
for her to speak, my father answered: "I've got to go back to New York this afternoon, but
I'm coming to see you again." I turned abruptly and went over to my mother, and almost in a
whisper reminded her that I had an appointment which I should not miss; to my pleasant surprise
she said that she would give me something to eat at once so that I might go. She went out of
the room and I began to gather from off the piano the music I needed. When I had finished,
my father, who had been watching me, asked: "Are you going?" I replied: "Yes, sir, I've got
to go to practice for a concert." He spoke some words of advice to me about being a good boy
and taking care of my mother when I grew up, and added that he was going to send me something
nice from New York. My mother called, and I said good-bye to him and went out. I saw him only
once after that.

I quickly swallowed down what my mother had put on the table for me, seized my cap and music,
and hurried off to my teacher's house. On the way I could think of nothing but this new father,
where he came from, where he had been, why he was here, and why he would not stay. In my mind
I ran over the whole list of fathers I had become acquainted with in my reading, but I could
not classify him. The thought did not cross my mind that he was different from me, and even
if it had, the mystery would not thereby have been explained; for, notwithstanding my changed
relations with most of my schoolmates, I had only a faint knowledge of prejudice and no idea
at all how it ramified and affected our entire social organism. I felt, however, that there
was something about the whole affair which had to be hid.

When I arrived, I found that she of the brown eyes had been rehearsing with my teacher and
was on the point of leaving. My teacher, with some expressions of surprise, asked why I was
late, and I stammered out the first deliberate lie of which I have any recollection. I told
him that when I reached home from school, I found my mother quite sick, and that I had stayed
with her awhile before coming. Then unnecessarily and gratuitously--to give my words force
of conviction, I suppose--I added: "I don't think she'll be with us very long." In speaking
these words I must have been comical; for I noticed that my teacher, instead of showing signs
of anxiety or sorrow, half hid a smile. But how little did I know that in that lie I was speaking
a prophecy!

She of the brown eyes unpacked her violin, and we went through the duet several times. I was
soon lost to all other thoughts in the delights of music and love. I saw delights of love without
reservation; for at no time of life is love so pure, so delicious, so poetic, so romantic,
as it is in boyhood. A great deal has been said about the heart of a girl when she' stands
"where the brook and river meet," but what she feels is negative; more interesting is the heart
of a boy when just at the budding dawn of manhood he stands looking wide-eyed into the long
vistas opening before him; when he first becomes conscious of the awakening and quickening
of strange desires and unknown powers; when what he sees and feels is still shadowy and mystical
enough to be intangible, and, so, more beautiful; when his imagination is unsullied, and his
faith new and whole--then it is that love wears a halo. The man who has not loved before he
was fourteen has missed a foretaste of Elysium.

When I reached home, it was quite dark and I found my mother without a light, sitting rocking
in a chair, as she so often used to do in my childhood days, looking into the fire and singing
softly to herself. I nestled close to her, and, with her arms round me, she haltingly told
me who my father was--a great man, a fine gentleman--he loved me and loved her very much; he
was going to make a great man of me: All she said was so limited by reserve and so colored
by her feelings that it was but half truth; and so I did not yet fully understand.

III

Perhaps I ought not pass on in this narrative without mentioning that the duet was a great
success, so great that we were obliged to respond with two encores. It seemed to me that life
could hold no greater joy than it contained when I took her hand and we stepped down to the
front of the stage bowing to our enthusiastic audience. When we reached the little dressing-room,
where the other performers were applauding as wildly as the audience, she impulsively threw
both her arms round me and kissed me, while I struggled to get away.

One day a couple of weeks after my father had been to see us, a wagon drove up to our cottage
loaded with a big box. I was about to tell the men on the wagon that they had made a mistake,
when my mother, acting darkly wise, told them to bring their load in; she had them unpack the
box, and quickly there was evolved from the boards, paper, and other packing material a beautiful,
brand-new, upright piano. Then she informed me that it was a present to me from my father.
I at once sat down and ran my fingers over the keys; the full, mellow tone of the instrument
was ravishing. I thought, almost remorsefully, of how I had left my father; but, even so, there
momentarily crossed my mind a feeling of disappointment that the piano was not a grand. The
new instrument greatly increased the pleasure of my hours of study and practice at home.

Shortly after this I was made a member of the boys' choir, it being found that I possessed
a clear, strong soprano voice. I enjoyed the singing very much. About a year later I began
the study of the pipe organ and the theory of music; and before I finished the grammar school,
I had written out several simple preludes for organ which won the admiration of my teacher,
and which he did me the honor to play at services.

The older I grew, the more thought I gave to the question of my mother's and my position, and
what was our exact relation to the world in general. My idea of the whole matter was rather
hazy. My study of United States history had been confined to those periods which were designated
in my book as "Discovery," "Colonial," "Revolutionary," and "Constitutional." I now began to
study about the Civil War, but the story was told in such a condensed and skipping style that
I gained from it very little real information. It is a marvel how children ever learn any history
out of books of that sort. And, too, I began now to read the newspapers; I often saw articles
which aroused my curiosity, but did not enlighten me. But one day I drew from the circulating
library a book that cleared the whole mystery, a book that I read with the same feverish intensity
with which I had read the old Bible stories, a book that gave me my first perspective of the
life I was entering; that book was Uncle Tom's Cabin.

This work of Harriet Beecher Stowe has been the object of much unfavorable criticism. It has
been assailed, not only as fiction of the most imaginative sort, but as being a direct misrepresentation.
Several successful attempts have lately been made to displace the book from Northern school
libraries. Its critics would brush it aside with the remark that there never was a Negro as
good as Uncle Tom, nor a slave-holder as bad as Legree. For my part, I was never an admirer
of Uncle Tom, nor of his type of goodness; but I believe that there were lots of old Negroes
as foolishly good as he; the proof of which is that they knowingly stayed and worked the plantations
that furnished sinews for the army which was fighting to keep them enslaved. But in these later
years several cases have come to my personal knowledge in which old Negroes have died and left
what was a considerable fortune to the descendants of their former masters. I do not think
it takes any great stretch of the imagination to believe there was a fairly large class of
slave-holders typified in Legree. And we must also remember that the author depicted a number
of worthless if not vicious Negroes, and a slave-holder who was as much of a Christian and
a gentleman as it was possible for one in his position to be; that she pictured the happy,
singing, shuffling "darky" as well as the mother wailing for her child sold "down river."

I do not think it is claiming too much to say that Uncle Tom's Cabin was a fair and truthful
panorama of slavery; however that may be, it opened my eyes as to who and what I was and what
my country considered me; in fact, it gave me my bearing. But there was no shock; I took the
whole revelation in a kind of stoical way. One of the greatest benefits I derived from reading
the book was that I could afterwards talk frankly with my mother on all the questions which
had been vaguely troubling my mind. As a result, she was entirely freed from reserve, and often
herself brought up the subject, talking of things directly touching her life and mine and of
things which had come down to her through the "old folks." What she told me interested and
even fascinated me, and, what may seem strange, kindled in me a strong desire to see the South.
She spoke to me quite frankly about herself, my father, and myself: she, the sewing girl of
my father's mother; he, an impetuous young man home from college; I, the child of this unsanctioned
love. She told me even the principal reason for our coming north. My father was about to be
married to a young lady of another great Southern family; She did not neglect to add that another
reason for our being in Connecticut was that he intended to give me an education and make a
man of me. In none of her talks did she ever utter one word of complaint against my father.
She always endeavored to impress upon me how good he had been and still was, and that he was
all to us that custom and the law would allow. She loved him; more, she worshiped him, and
she died firmly believing that he loved her more than any other woman in the world. Perhaps
she was right. Who knows?

All of these newly awakened ideas and thoughts took the form of a definite aspiration on the
day I graduated from the grammar school. And what a day that was! The girls in white dresses,
with fresh ribbons in their hair; the boys in new suits and creaky shoes; the great crowd of
parents and friends; the flowers, the prizes and congratulations, made the day seem to me one
of the greatest importance. I was on the program, and played a piano solo which was received
by the audience with that amount of applause which I had come to look upon as being only the
just due of my talent.

But the real enthusiasm was aroused by "Shiny." He was the principal speaker of the day, and
well did he measure up to the honor. He made a striking picture, that thin little black boy
standing on the platform, dressed in clothes that did not fit him any too well, his eyes burning
with excitement, his shrill, musical voice vibrating in tones of appealing defiance, and his
black face alight with such great intelligence and earnestness as to be positively handsome.
What were his thoughts when he stepped forward and looked into that crowd of faces, all white
with the exception of a score or so that were lost to view? I do not know, but I fancy he felt
his loneliness. I think there must have rushed over him a feeling akin to that of a gladiator
tossed into the arena and bade to fight for his life. I think that solitary little black figure
standing there felt that for the particular time and place he bore the weight and responsibility
of his race; that for him to fail meant general defeat; but he won, and nobly. His oration
was Wendell Phillips's "Toussaint L'Ouverture," a speech which may now be classed as rhetorical--even,
perhaps, bombastic; but as the words fell from "Shiny's" lips their effect was magical. How
so young an orator could stir so great enthusiasm was to be wondered at. When, in the famous
peroration, his voice, trembling with suppressed emotion, rose higher and higher and then rested
on the name "Toussaint L'Ouverture," it was like touching an electric button which loosed the
pent-up feelings of his listeners. They actually rose to him.

I have since known of colored men who have been chosen as class orators in our leading universities,
of others who have played on the varsity football and baseball teams, of colored speakers who
have addressed great white audiences. In each of these instances I believe the men were stirred
by the same emotions which actuated "Shiny" on the day of his graduation; and, too, in each
case where the efforts have reached any high standard of excellence they have been followed
by the same phenomenon of enthusiasm. I think the explanation of the latter lies in what is
a basic, though often dormant, principle of the Anglo-Saxon heart, love of fair play. "Shiny,"
it is true, was what is so common in his race, a natural orator; but I doubt that any white
boy of equal talent could have wrought the same effect. The sight of that boy gallantly waging
with puny, black arms so unequal a battle touched the deep springs in the hearts of his audience,
and they were swept by a wave of sympathy and admiration.

But the effect upon me of "Shiny's" speech was double; I not only shared the enthusiasm of
his audience, but he imparted to me some of his own enthusiasm. I felt leap within me pride
that I was colored; and I began to form wild dreams of bringing glory and honor to the Negro
race. For days I could talk of nothing else with my mother except my ambitions to be a great
man, a great colored man, to reflect credit on the race and gain fame for myself. It was not
until years after that I formulated a definite and feasible plan for realizing my dreams.

I entered the high school with my class, and still continued my study of the piano, the pipe
organ, and the theory of music. I had to drop out of the boys' choir on account of a changing
voice; this I regretted very much. As I grew older, my love for reading grew stronger. I read
with studious interest everything I could find relating to colored men who had gained prominence.
My heroes had been King David, then Robert the Bruce; now Frederick Douglass was enshrined
in the place of honor. When I learned that Alexandre Dumas was a colored man, I re-read Monte
Cristo and The Three Guardsmen with magnified pleasure. I lived between my music and books,
on the whole a rather unwholesome life for a boy to lead. I dwelt in a world of imagination,
of dreams and air castles--the kind of atmosphere that sometimes nourishes a genius, more often
men unfitted for the practical struggles of life. I never played a game of ball, never went
fishing or learned to swim; in fact, the only outdoor exercise in which I took any interest
was skating. Nevertheless, though slender, I grew well formed and in perfect health. After
I entered the high school, I began to notice the change in my mother's health, which I suppose
had been going on for some years. She began to complain a little and to cough a great deal;
she tried several remedies, and finally went to see a doctor; but though she was failing in
health, she kept her spirits up. She still did a great deal of sewing, and in the busy seasons
hired two women to help her. The purpose she had formed of having me go through college without
financial worries kept her at work when she was not fit for it. I was so fortunate as to be
able to organize a class of eight or ten beginners on the piano, and so start a separate little
fund of my own. As the time for my graduation from the high school grew nearer, the plans for
my college career became the chief subject of our talks. I sent for catalogues of all the prominent
schools in the East and eagerly gathered all the information I could concerning them from different
sources. My mother told me that my father wanted me to go to Harvard or Yale; she herself had
a half desire for me to go to Atlanta University, and even had me write for a catalogue of
that school. There were two reasons, however, that inclined her to my father's choice; the
first, that at Harvard or Yale I should be near her; the second, that my father had promised
to pay for a part of my college education.

Both "Shiny" and "Red" came to my house quite often of evenings, and we used to talk over our
plans and prospects for the future. Sometimes I would play for them, and they seemed to enjoy
the music very much. My mother often prepared sundry Southern dishes for them, which I am not
sure but that they enjoyed more. "Shiny" had an uncle in Amherst, Mass., and he expected to
live with him and work his way through Amherst College. "Red" declared that he had enough of
school and that after he got his high school diploma, he would get a position in a bank. It
was his ambition to become a banker and he felt sure of getting the opportunity through certain
members of his family.

My mother barely had strength to attend the closing exercises of the high school when I graduated,
and after that day she was seldom out of bed. She could no longer direct her work, and under
the expense of medicines, doctors, and someone to look after her our college fund began to
diminish rapidly. Many of her customers and some of the neighbors were very kind, and frequently
brought her nourishment of one kind or another. My mother realized what I did not, that she
was mortally ill, and she had me write a long letter to my father. For some time past she had
heard from him only at irregular intervals; we never received an answer. In those last days
I often sat at her bedside and read to her until she fell asleep. Sometimes I would leave the
parlor door open and play on the piano, just loud enough for the music to reach her. This she
always enjoyed.

One night, near the end of July, after I had been watching beside her for some hours, I went
into the parlor and, throwing myself into the big arm chair, dozed off into a fitful sleep.
I was suddenly aroused by one of the neighbors, who had come in to sit with her that night.
She said: "Come to your mother at once." I hurried upstairs, and at the bedroom door met the
woman who was acting as nurse. I noted with a dissolving heart the strange look of awe on her
face. From my first glance at my mother I discerned the light of death upon her countenance.
I fell upon my knees beside the bed and, burying my face in the sheets, sobbed convulsively.
She died with the fingers of her left hand entwined in my hair.

I will not rake over this, one of the two sacred sorrows of my life; nor could I describe the
feeling of unutterable loneliness that fell upon me. After the funeral I went to the house
of my music teacher; he had kindly offered me the hospitality of his home for so long as I
might need it. A few days later I moved my trunk, piano, my music, and most of my books to
his home; the rest of my books I divided between "Shiny" and "Red." Some of the household effects
I gave to "Shiny's" mother and to two or three of the neighbors who had been kind to us during
my mother's illness; the others I sold. After settling up my little estate I found that, besides
a good supply of clothes, a piano, some books and trinkets, I had about two hundred dollars
in cash.

The question of what I was to do now confronted me. My teacher suggested a concert tour; but
both of us realized that I was too old to be exploited as an infant prodigy and too young and
inexperienced to go before the public as a finished artist. He, however, insisted that the
people of the town would generously patronize a benefit concert; so he took up the matter and
made arrangements for such an entertainment. A more than sufficient number of people with musical
and elocutionary talent volunteered their services to make a program. Among these was my brown-eyed
violinist. But our relations were not the same as they were when we had played our first duet
together. A year or so after that time she had dealt me a crushing blow by getting married.
I was partially avenged, however, by the fact that, though she was growing more beautiful,
she was losing her ability to play the violin.

I was down on the program for one number. My selection might have appeared at that particular
time as a bit of affectation, but I considered it deeply appropriate; I played Beethoven's
"Sonata Pathétique." When I sat down at the piano and glanced into the faces of the several
hundreds of people who were there solely on account of love or sympathy for me, emotions swelled
in my heart which enabled me to play the "Pathétique" as I could never again play it. When
the last tone died away, the few who began to applaud were hushed by the silence of the others;
and for once I played without receiving an encore.

The benefit yielded me a little more than two hundred dollars, thus raising my cash capital
to about four hundred dollars. I still held to my determination of going to college; so it
was now a question of trying to squeeze through a year at Harvard or going to Atlanta, where
the money I had would pay my actual expenses for at least two years. The peculiar fascination
which the South held over my imagination and my limited capital decided me in favor of Atlanta
University; so about the last of September I bade farewell to the friends and scenes of my
boyhood and boarded a train for the South.

IV

The farther I got below Washington, the more disappointed I became in the appearance of the
country. I peered through the car windows, looking in vain for the luxuriant semi-tropical
scenery which I had pictured in my mind. I did not find the grass so green, nor the woods so
beautiful, nor the flowers so plentiful, as they were in Connecticut. Instead, the red earth
partly covered by tough, scrawny grass, the muddy, straggling roads, the cottages of unpainted
pine boards, and the clay-daubed huts imparted a "burnt up" impression. Occasionally we ran
through a little white and green village that was like an oasis in a desert.

When I reached Atlanta, my steadily increasing disappointment was not lessened. I found it
a big, dull, red town. This dull red color of that part of the South I was then seeing had
much, I think, to do with the extreme depression of my spirits--no public squares, no fountains,
dingy street-cars, and, with the exception of three or four principal thoroughfares, unpaved
streets. It was raining when I arrived and some of these unpaved streets were absolutely impassable.
Wheels sank to the hubs in red mire, and I actually stood for an hour and watched four or five
men work to save a mule, which had stepped into a deep sink, from drowning, or, rather, suffocating
in the mud. The Atlanta of today is a new city.

On the train I had talked with one of the Pullman car porters, a bright young fellow who was
himself a student, and told him that I was going to Atlanta to attend school. I had also asked
him to tell me where I might stop for a day or two until the University opened. He said I might
go with him to the place where he stopped during his "lay-overs" in Atlanta. I gladly accepted
his offer and went with him along one of those muddy streets until we came to a rather rickety
looking frame house, which we entered. The proprietor of the house was a big, fat, greasy-looking
brown-skin man. When I asked him if he could give me accommodations, he wanted to know how
long I would stay. I told him perhaps two days, not more than three. In reply he said: "Oh,
dat's all right den," at the same time leading the way up a pair of creaky stairs. I followed
him and the porter to a room, the door of which the proprietor opened while continuing, it
seemed, his remark, "Oh, dat's all right den," by adding: "You kin sleep in dat cot in de corner
der. Fifty cents, please." The porter interrupted by saying: "You needn't collect from him
now, he's got a trunk." This seemed to satisfy the man, and he went down, leaving me and my
porter friend in the room. I glanced around the apartment and saw that it contained a double
bed and two cots, two wash-stands, three chairs, and a time-worn bureau, with a looking-glass
that would have made Adonis appear hideous. I looked at the cot in which I was to sleep and
suspected, not without good reasons, that I should not be the first to use the sheets and pillow-case
since they had last come from the wash. When I thought of the clean, tidy, comfortable surroundings
in which I had been reared, a wave of homesickness swept over me that made me feel faint. Had
it not been for the presence of my companion, and that I knew this much of his history--that
he was not yet quite twenty, just three years older than myself, and that he had been fighting
his own way in the world, earning his own living and providing for his own education since
he was fourteen--I should not have been able to stop the tears that were welling up in my eyes.

I asked him why it was that the proprietor of the house seemed unwilling to accommodate me
for more than a couple of days. He informed me that the man ran a lodging house especially
for Pullman porters, and, as their stays in town were not longer than one or two nights, it
would interfere with his arrangements to have anyone stay longer. He went on to say: "You see
this room is fixed up to accommodate four men at a time. Well, by keeping a sort of table of
trips, in and out, of the men, and working them like checkers, he can accommodate fifteen or
sixteen in each week and generally avoid having an empty bed. You happen to catch a bed that
would have been empty for a couple of nights." I asked him where he was going to sleep. He
answered: "I sleep in that other cot tonight; tomorrow night I go out." He went on to tell
me that the man who kept the house did not serve meals, and that if I was hungry, we would
go out and get something to eat.

We went into the street, and in passing the railroad station I hired a wagon to take my trunk
to my lodging place. We passed along until, finally, we turned into a street that stretched
away, up and down hill, for a mile or two; and here I caught my first sight of colored people
in large numbers. I had seen little squads around the railroad stations on my way south, but
here I saw a street crowded with them. They filled the shops and thronged the, sidewalks and
lined the curb. I asked my companion if all the colored people in Atlanta lived in this street.
He said they did not and assured me that the ones I saw were of the lower class. I felt relieved,
in spite of the size of the lower class. The unkempt appearance, the shambling, slouching gait
and loud talk and laughter of these people aroused in me a feeling of almost repulsion. Only
one thing about them awoke a feeling of interest; that was their dialect. I had read some Negro
dialect and had heard snatches of it on my journey down from Washington; but here I heard it
in all of its fullness and freedom. I was particularly struck by the way in which it was punctuated
by such exclamatory phrases as "Lawd a mussy!" "G'wan, man!" "Bless ma soul!" "Look heah, chile!"
These people talked and laughed without restraint. In fact, they talked straight from their
lungs and laughed from the pits of their stomachs. And this hearty laughter was often justified
by the droll humor of some remark. I paused long enough to hear one man say to another: "Wat's
de mattah wid you an' yo' fr'en' Sam?" and the other came back like a flash: "Ma fr'en'? He
ma fr'en'? Man! I'd go to his funeral jes' de same as I'd go to a minstrel show." I have since
learned that this ability to laugh heartily is, in part, the salvation of the American Negro;
it does much to keep him from going the way of the Indian.

The business places of the street along which we were passing consisted chiefly of low bars,
cheap dry-goods and notion stores, barber shops, and fish and bread restaurants. We, at length,
turned down a pair of stairs that led to a basement and I found myself in an eating-house somewhat
better than those I had seen in passing; but that did not mean much for its excellence. The
place was smoky, the tables were covered with oilcloth, the floor with sawdust, and from the
kitchen came a rancid odor of fish fried over several times, which almost nauseated me. I asked
my companion if this was the place where we were to eat. He informed me that it was the best
place in town where a colored man could get a meal. I then wanted to know why somebody didn't
open a place where respectable colored people who had money could be accommodated. He answered:
"It wouldn't pay; all the respectable colored people eat at home, and the few who travel generally
have friends in the towns to which they go, who entertain them." He added: "Of course, you
could go in any place in the city; they wouldn't know you from white."

I sat down with the porter at one of the tables, but was not hungry enough to eat with any
relish what was put before me. The food was not badly cooked; but the iron knives and forks
needed to be scrubbed, the plates and dishes and glasses needed to be washed and well dried.
I minced over what I took on my plate while my companion ate. When we finished, we paid the
waiter twenty cents each and went out. We walked around until the lights of the city were lit.
Then the porter said that he must get to bed and have some rest, as he had not had six hours'
sleep since he left Jersey City. I went back to our lodging house with him.

When I awoke in the morning, there were, besides my new-found friend, two other men in the
room, asleep in the double bed. I got up and dressed myself very quietly, so as not to awake
anyone. I then drew from under the pillow my precious roll of greenbacks, took out a ten-dollar
bill, and, very softly unlocking my trunk, put the remainder, about three hundred dollars,
in the inside pocket of a coat near the bottom, glad of the opportunity to put it unobserved
in a place of safety. When I had carefully locked my trunk, I tiptoed toward the door with
the intention of going out to look for a decent restaurant where I might get something fit
to eat. As I was easing the door open, my porter friend said with a yawn: "Hello! You're going
out?" I answered him: "Yes." "Oh!" he yawned again, "I guess I've had enough sleep; wait a
minute, I'll go with you." For the instant his friendship bored and embarrassed me. I had visions
of another meal in the greasy restaurant of the day before. He must have divined my thoughts,
for he went on to say: "I know a woman across town who takes a few boarders; I think we can
go over there and get a good breakfast." With a feeling of mingled fears and doubts regarding
what the breakfast might be, I waited until he had dressed himself.

When I saw the neat appearance of the cottage we entered, my fears vanished, and when I saw
the woman who kept it, my doubts followed the same course. Scrupulously clean, in a spotless
white apron and colored head-handkerchief, her round face beaming with motherly kindness, she
was picturesquely beautiful. She impressed me as one broad expanse of happiness and good nature.
In a few minutes she was addressing me as "chile" and "honey." She made me feel as though I
should like to lay my head on her capacious bosom and go to sleep.

And the breakfast, simple as it was, I could not have had at any restaurant in Atlanta at any
price. There was fried chicken, as it is fried only in the South, hominy boiled to the consistency
where it could be eaten with a fork, and biscuits so light and flaky that a fellow with any
appetite at all would have no difficulty in disposing of eight or ten. When I had finished,
I felt that I had experienced the realization of, at least, one of my dreams of Southern life.

During the meal we found out from our hostess, who had two boys in school, that Atlanta University
opened on that very day. I had somehow mixed my dates. My friend the porter suggested that
I go out to the University at once and offered to walk over and show me the way. We had to
walk because, although the University was not more than twenty minutes' distance from the center
of the city, there were no street-cars running in that direction. My first sight of the School
grounds made me feel that I was not far from home; here the red hills had been terraced and
covered with green grass; clean gravel walks, well shaded, led up to the buildings; indeed,
it was a bit of New England transplanted. At the gate my companion said he would bid me good-by,
because it was likely that he would not see me again before his car went out. He told me that
he would make two more trips to Atlanta and that he would come out and see me; that after his
second trip he would leave the Pullman service for the winter and return to school in Nashville.
We shook hands, I thanked him for all his kindness, and we said good-by.

I walked up to a group of students and made some inquiries. They directed me to the president's
office in the main building. The president gave me a cordial welcome; it was more than cordial;
he talked to me, not as the official head of a college, but as though he were adopting me into
what was his large family, personally to look after my general welfare as well as my education.
He seemed especially pleased with the fact that I had come to them all the way from the North.
He told me that I could have come to the school as soon as I had reached the city and that
I had better move my trunk out at once. I gladly promised him that I would do so. He then called
a boy and directed him to take me to the matron, and to show me around afterwards. I found
the matron even more motherly than the president was fatherly. She had me register, which was
in effect to sign a pledge to abstain from the use of intoxicating beverages, tobacco, and
profane language while I was a student in the school. This act caused me no sacrifice, as,
up to that time, I was free from all three habits. The boy who was with me then showed me about
the grounds. I was especially interested in the industrial building.

The sounding of a bell, he told me, was the signal for the students to gather in the general
assembly hall, and he asked me if I would go. Of course I would. There were between three and
four hundred students and perhaps all of the teachers gathered in the room. I noticed that
several of the latter were colored. The president gave a talk addressed principally to newcomers;
but I scarcely heard what he said, I was so much occupied in looking at those around me. They
were of all types and colors, the more intelligent types predominating. The colors ranged from
jet black to pure white, with light hair and eyes. Among the girls especially there were many
so fair that it was difficult to believe that they had Negro blood in them. And, too, I could
not help noticing that many of the girls, particularly those of the delicate brown shades,
with black eyes and wavy dark hair, were decidedly pretty. Among the boys many of the blackest
were fine specimens of young manhood, tall, straight, and muscular, with magnificent heads;
these were the kind of boys who developed into the patriarchal "uncles" of the old slave regime.

When I left the University, it was with the determination to get my trunk and move out to the
school before night. I walked back across the city with a light step and a light heart. I felt
perfectly satisfied with life for the first time since my mother's death. In passing the railroad
station I hired a wagon and rode with the driver as far as my stopping-place. I settled with
my landlord and went upstairs to put away several articles I had left out. As soon as I opened
my trunk, a dart of suspicion shot through my heart; the arrangement of things did not look
familiar. I began to dig down excitedly to the bottom till I reached the coat in which I had
concealed my treasure. My money was gone! Every single bill of it. I knew it was useless to
do so, but I searched through every other coat, every pair of trousers, every vest, and even
each pair of socks. When I had finished my fruitless search, I sat down dazed and heartsick.
I called the landlord up and informed him of my loss; he comforted me by saying that I ought
to have better sense than to keep money in a trunk and that he was not responsible for his
lodgers' personal effects. His cooling words brought me enough to my senses to cause me to
look and see if anything else was missing. Several small articles were gone, among them a black
and gray necktie of odd design upon which my heart was set; almost as much as the loss of my
money I felt the loss of my tie.

After thinking for a while as best I could, I wisely decided to go at once back to the University
and lay my troubles before the president. I rushed breathlessly back to the school. As I neared
the grounds, the thought came across me, would not my story sound fishy? Would it not place
me in the position of an impostor or beggar? What right had I to worry these busy people with
the results of my carelessness? If the money could not be recovered, and I doubted that it
could, what good would it do to tell them about it? The shame and embarrassment which the whole
situation gave me caused me to stop at the gate. I paused, undecided, for a moment; then, turned
and slowly retraced my steps, and so changed the whole course of my life.

If the reader has never been in a strange city without money or friends, it is useless to try
to describe what my feelings were; he could not understand. If he has been, it is equally useless,
for he understands more than words could convey. When I reached my lodgings, I found in the
room one of the porters who had slept there the night before. When he heard what misfortune
had befallen me, he offered many words of sympathy and advice. He asked me how much money I
had left. I told him that I had ten or twelve dollars in my pocket. He said: "That won't last
you very long here, and you will hardly be able to find anything to do in Atlanta. I'll tell
you what you do, go down to Jacksonville and you won't have any trouble to get a job in one
of the big hotels there, or in St. Augustine." I thanked him, but intimated my doubts of being
able to get to Jacksonville on the money I had. He reassured me by saying: "Oh, that's all
right. You express your trunk on through, and I'll take you down in my closet." I thanked him
again, not knowing then what it was to travel in a Pullman porter's closet. He put me under
a deeper debt of gratitude by lending me fifteen dollars, which he said I could pay back after
I had secured work. His generosity brought tears to my eyes, and I concluded that, after all,
there were some kind hearts in the world.

I now forgot my troubles in the hurry and excitement of getting my trunk off in time to catch
the train, which went out at seven o'clock. I even forgot that I hadn't eaten anything since
morning. We got a wagon--the porter went with me--and took my trunk to the express office.
My new friend then told me to come to the station at about a quarter of seven and walk straight
to the car where I should see him standing, and not to lose my nerve. I found my role not so
difficult to play as I thought it would be, because the train did not leave from the central
station, but from a smaller one, where there were no gates and guards to pass. I followed directions,
and the porter took me on his car and locked me in his closet. In a few minutes the train pulled
out for Jacksonville.

I may live to be a hundred years old, but I shall never forget the agonies I suffered that
night. I spent twelve hours doubled up in the porter's basket for soiled linen, not being able
to straighten up on account of the shelves for clean linen just over my head. The air was hot
and suffocating and the smell of damp towels and used linen was sickening. At each lurch of
the car over the none-too-smooth track I was bumped and bruised against the narrow walls of
my narrow compartment. I became acutely conscious of the fact that I had not eaten for hours.
Then nausea took possession of me, and at one time I had grave doubts about reaching my destination
alive. If I had the trip to make again, I should prefer to walk.

V

The next morning I got out of the car at Jacksonville with a stiff and aching body. I determined
to ask no more porters, not even my benefactor, about stopping-places; so I found myself on
the street not knowing where to go. I walked along listlessly until I met a colored man who
had the appearance of a preacher. I asked him if he could direct me to a respectable boarding-house
for colored people. He said that if I walked along with him in the direction he was going,
he would show me such a place: I turned and walked at his side. He proved to be a minister,
and asked me a great many direct questions about myself. I answered as many as I saw fit to
answer; the others I evaded or ignored. At length we stopped in front of a frame house, and
my guide informed me that it was the place. A woman was standing in the doorway, and he called
to her saying that he had brought her a new boarder. I thanked him for his trouble, and after
he had urged upon, me to attend his church while I was in the city, he went on his way.

I went in and found the house neat and not uncomfortable. The parlor was furnished with cane-bottomed
chairs, each of which was adorned with a white crocheted tidy. The mantel over the fireplace
had a white crocheted cover; a marble-topped center table held a lamp, a photograph album and
several trinkets, each of which was set upon a white crocheted mat. There was a cottage organ
in a corner of the room, and I noted that the lamp-racks upon it were covered with white crocheted
mats. There was a matting on the floor, but a white crocheted carpet would not have been out
of keeping. I made arrangements with the landlady for my board and lodging; the amount was,
I think, three dollars and a half a week. She was a rather fine-looking, stout, brown-skin
woman of about forty years of age. Her husband was a light-colored Cuban, a man about one half
her size, and one whose age could not be guessed from his appearance. He was small in size,
but a handsome black mustache and typical Spanish eyes redeemed him from insignificance.

I was in time for breakfast, and at the table I had the opportunity to see my fellow boarders.
There were eight or ten of them. Two, as I afterwards learned, were colored Americans. All
of them were cigar makers and worked in one of the large factories--cigar making is one trade
in which the color line is not drawn. The conversation was carried on entirely in Spanish,
and my ignorance of the language subjected me more to alarm than embarrassment. I had never
heard such uproarious conversation; everybody talked at once, loud exclamations, rolling "carambas,"
menacing gesticulations with knives, forks, and spoons. I looked every moment for the clash
of blows. One man was emphasizing his remarks by flourishing a cup in his hand, seemingly forgetful
of the fact that it was nearly full of hot coffee. He ended by emptying it over what was, relatively,
the only quiet man at the table excepting myself, bringing from him a volley of language which
made the others appear dumb by comparison. I soon learned that in all of this clatter of voices
and table utensils they were discussing purely ordinary affairs and arguing about mere trifles,
and that not the least ill feeling was aroused. It was not long before I enjoyed the spirited
chatter and badinage at the table as much as I did my meals--and the meals were not bad.

I spent the afternoon in looking around the town. The streets were sandy, but were well-shaded
by fine oak trees and far preferable to the clay roads of Atlanta. One or two public squares
with green grass and trees gave the city a touch of freshness. That night after supper I spoke
to my landlady and her husband about my intentions. They told me that the big winter hotels
would not open within two months. It can easily be imagined what effect this news had on me.
I spoke to them frankly about my financial condition and related the main fact of my misfortune
in Atlanta. I modestly mentioned my ability to teach music and asked if there was any likelihood
of my being able to get some scholars. My landlady suggested that I speak to the preacher who
had shown me her house; she felt sure that through his influence I should be able to get up
a class in piano. She added, however, that the colored people were poor, and that the general
price for music lessons was only twenty-five cents. I noticed that the thought of my teaching
white pupils did not even remotely enter her mind. None of this information made my prospects
look much brighter.

The husband, who up to this time had allowed the woman to do most of the talking, gave me the
first bit of tangible hope; he said that he could get me a job as a "stripper" in the factory
where he worked, and that if I succeeded in getting some music pupils, I could teach a couple
of them every night, and so make a living until something better turned up. He went on to say
that it would not be a bad thing for me to stay at the factory and learn my trade as a cigar
maker, and impressed on me that, for a young man knocking about the country, a trade was a
handy thing to have. I determined to accept his offer and thanked him heartily. In fact, I
became enthusiastic, not only because I saw a way out of my financial troubles, but also because
I was eager and curious over the new experience I was about to enter. I wanted to know all
about the cigar making business. This narrowed the conversation down to the husband and myself,
so the wife went in and left us talking.

He was what is called a regalia workman, and earned from thirty-five to forty dollars a week.
He generally worked a sixty-dollar job; that is, he made cigars for which he was paid at the
rate of sixty dollars per thousand. It was impossible for him to make a thousand in a week
because he had to work very carefully and slowly. Each cigar was made entirely by hand. Each
piece of filler and each wrapper had to be selected with care. He was able to make a bundle
of one hundred cigars in a day, not one of which could be told from the others by any difference
in size or shape, or even by any appreciable difference in weight. This was the acme of artistic
skill in cigar making. Workmen of this class were rare, never more than three or four in one
factory, and it was never necessary for them to remain out of work. There were men who made
two, three, and four hundred cigars of the cheaper grades in a day; they had to be very fast
in order to make a decent week's wages. Cigar making was a rather independent trade; the men
went to work when they pleased and knocked off when they felt like doing so. As a class the
workmen were careless and improvident; some very rapid makers would not work more than three
or four days out of the week, and there were others who never showed up at the factory on Mondays.
"Strippers" were the boys who pulled the long stems from the tobacco leaves. After they had
served at that work for a certain time they were given tables as apprentices.

All of this was interesting to me; and we drifted along in conversation until my companion
struck the subject nearest his heart, the independence of Cuba. He was an exile from the island,
and a prominent member of the Jacksonville Junta. Every week sums of money were collected from
juntas all over the country. This money went to buy arms and ammunition for the insurgents.
As the man sat there nervously smoking his long, "green" cigar, and telling me of the Gómezes,
both the white one and the black one, of Macéo and Bandera, he grew positively eloquent. He
also showed that he was a man of considerable education and reading. He spoke English excellently,
and frequently surprised me by using words one would hardly expect from a foreigner. The first
one of this class of words he employed almost shocked me, and I never forgot it; 'twas "ramify."
We sat on the piazza until after ten o'clock. When we arose to go in to bed, it was with the
understanding that I should start in the factory on the next day.

I began work the next morning seated at a barrel with another boy, who showed me how to strip
the stems from the leaves, to smooth out each half leaf, and to put the "rights" together in
one pile, and the "lefts" together in another pile on the edge of the barrel. My fingers, strong
and sensitive from their long training, were well adapted to this kind of work, and within
two weeks I was accounted the fastest "stripper" in the factory. At first the heavy odor of
the tobacco almost sickened me, but when I became accustomed to it, I liked the smell. I was
now earning four dollars a week, and was soon able to pick up a couple more by teaching a few
scholars at night, whom I had secured through the good offices of the preacher I had met on
my first morning in Jacksonville.

At the end of about three months, through my skill as a "stripper" and the influence of my
landlord, I was advanced to a table and began to learn my trade; in fact, more than my trade;
for I learned not only to make cigars, but also to smoke, to swear, and to speak Spanish. I
discovered that I had a talent for languages as well as for music. The rapidity and ease with
which I acquired Spanish astonished my associates. In a short time I was able not only to understand
most of what was said at the table during meals, but to join in the conversation. I bought
a method for learning the Spanish language, and with the aid of my landlord as a teacher, by
constant practice with my fellow workmen, and by regularly reading the Cuban newspapers and
finally some books of standard Spanish literature which were at the house, I was able in less
than a year to speak like a native. In fact, it was my pride that I spoke better Spanish than
many of the Cuban workmen at the factory.

After I had been in the factory a little over a year, I was repaid for all the effort I had
put forth to learn Spanish by being selected as "reader." The "reader" is quite an institution
in all cigar factories which employ Spanish-speaking workmen. He sits in the center of the
large room in which the cigar makers work and reads to them for a certain number of hours each
day all the important news from the papers and whatever else he may consider would be interesting.
He often selects an exciting novel and reads it in daily installments. He must, of course,
have a good voice, but he must also have a reputation among the men for intelligence, for being
well-posted and having in his head a stock of varied information. He is generally the final
authority on all arguments which arise, and in a cigar factory these arguments are many and
frequent, ranging from the respective and relative merits of rival baseball clubs to the duration
of the sun's light and energy--cigar making is a trade in which talk does not interfere with
work. My position as "reader" not only released me from the rather monotonous work of rolling
cigars, and gave me something more in accord with my tastes, but also added considerably to
my income. I was now earning about twenty-five dollars a week, and was able to give up my peripatetic
method of giving music lessons. I hired a piano and taught only those who could arrange to
take their lessons where I lived. I finally gave up teaching entirely, as what I made scarcely
paid for my time and trouble. I kept the piano, however, in order to keep up my own studies,
and occasionally I played at some church concert or other charitable entertainment.

Through my music teaching and my not absolutely irregular attendance at church, I became acquainted
with the best class of colored people in Jacksonville. This was really my entrance into the
race. It was my initiation into what I have termed the freemasonry of the race. I had formulated
a theory of what it was to be colored; now I was getting the practice. The novelty of my position
caused me to observe and consider things which, I think, entirely escaped the young men I associated
with; or, at least, were so commonplace to them as not to attract their attention. And of many
of the impressions which came to me then I have realized the full import only within the past
few years, since I have had a broader knowledge of men and history, and a fuller comprehension
of the tremendous struggle which is going on between the races in the South.

It is a struggle; for though the black man fights passively, he nevertheless fights; and his
passive resistance is more effective at present than active resistance could possibly be. He
bears the fury of the storm as does the willow tree.

It is a struggle; for though the white man of the South may be too proud to admit it, he is,
nevertheless, using in the contest his best energies; he is devoting to it the greater part
of his thought and much of his endeavor. The South today stands panting and almost breathless
from its exertions.

And how the scene of the struggle has shifted! The battle was first waged over the right of
the Negro to be classed as a human being with a soul; later, as to whether he had sufficient
intellect to master even the rudiments of learning; and today it is being fought out over his
social recognition.

I said somewhere in the early part of this narrative that because the colored man looked at
everything through the prism of his relationship to society as a colored man, and because most
of his mental efforts ran through the narrow channel bounded by his rights and his wrongs,
it was to be wondered at that he has progressed so broadly as he has. The same thing may be
said of the white man of the South; most of his mental efforts run through one narrow channel;
his life as a man and a citizen, many of his financial activities, and all of his political
activities are impassably limited by the ever present "Negro question." I am sure it would
be safe to wager that no group of Southern white men could get together and talk for sixty
minutes without bringing up the "race question." If a Northern white man happened to be in
the group, the time could be safely cut to thirty minutes. In this respect I consider the conditions
of the whites more to be deplored than that of the blacks. Here, a truly great people, a people
that produced a majority of the great historic Americans from Washington to Lincoln, now forced
to use up its energies in a conflict as lamentable as it is violent.

I shall give the observations I made in Jacksonville as seen through the light of after years;
and they apply generally to every Southern community. The colored people may be said to be
roughly divided into three classes, not so much in respect to themselves as in respect to their
relations with the whites. There are those constituting what might be called the desperate
class--the men who work in the lumber and turpentine camps, the ex-convicts, the bar-room loafers
are all in this class. These men conform to the requirements of civilization much as a trained
lion with low muttered growls goes through his stunts under the crack of the trainer's whip.
They cherish a sullen hatred for all white men, and they value life as cheap. I have heard
more than one of them say: "I'll go to hell for the first white man that bothers me." Many
who have expressed that sentiment have kept their word, and it is that fact which gives such
prominence to this class; for in numbers it is only a small proportion of the colored people,
but it often dominates public opinion concerning the whole race. Happily, this class represents
the black people of the South far below their normal physical and moral condition, but in its
increase lies the possibility of grave dangers. I am sure there is no more urgent work before
the white South, not only for its present happiness, but for its future safety, than the decreasing
of this class of blacks. And it is not at all a hopeless class; for these men are but the creatures
of conditions, as much so as the slum and criminal elements of all the great cities of the
world are creatures of conditions. Decreasing their number by shooting and burning them off
will not be successful; for these men are truly desperate, and thoughts of death, however terrible,
have little effect in deterring them from acts the result of hatred or degeneracy. This class
of blacks hate everything covered by a white skin, and in return they are loathed by the whites.
The whites regard them just about as a man would a vicious mule, a thing to be worked, driven,
and beaten, and killed for kicking.

The second class, as regards the relation between blacks and whites, comprises the servants,
the washerwomen, the waiters, the cooks, the coachmen, and all who are connected with the whites
by domestic service. These may be generally characterized as simple, kind-hearted, and faithful;
not over-fine in their moral deductions, but intensely religious, and relatively--such matters
can be judged only relatively--about as honest and wholesome in their lives as any other grade
of society. Any white person is "good" who treats them kindly, and they love him for that kindness.
In return, the white people with whom they have to do regard them with indulgent affection.
They come into close daily contact with the whites, and may be called the connecting link between
whites and blacks; in fact, it is through them that the whites know the rest of their colored
neighbors. Between this class of the blacks and the whites there is little or no friction.

The third class is composed of the independent workmen and tradesmen, and of the well-to-do
and educated colored people; and, strange to say, for a directly opposite reason they are as
far removed from the whites as the members of the first class I mentioned. These people live
in a little world of their own; in fact, I concluded that if a colored man wanted to separate
himself from his white neighbors, he had but to acquire some money, education, and culture,
and to live in accordance. For example, the proudest and fairest lady in the South could with
propriety--and it is what she would most likely do--go to the cabin of Aunt Mary, her cook,
if Aunt Mary was sick, and minister to her comfort with her own hands; but if Mary's daughter,
Eliza, a girl who used to run round my lady's kitchen, but who has received an education and
married a prosperous young colored man, were at death's door, my lady would no more think of
crossing the threshold of Eliza's cottage than she would of going into a bar-room for a drink.

I was walking down the street one day with a young man who was born in Jacksonville, but had
been away to prepare himself for a professional life. We passed a young white man, and my companion
said to me: "You see that young man? We grew up together; we have played, hunted, and fished
together; we have even eaten and slept together; and now since I have come back home, he barely
speaks to me." The fact that the whites of the South despise and ill-treat the desperate class
of blacks is not only explainable according to the ancient laws of human nature, but it is
not nearly so serious or important as the fact that as the progressive colored people advance,
they constantly widen the gulf between themselves and their white neighbors. I think that the
white people somehow feel that colored people who have education and money, who wear good clothes
and live in comfortable houses, are "putting on airs," that they do these things for the sole
purpose of "spiting the white folks," or are, at best, going through a sort of monkey-like
imitation. Of course, such feelings can only cause irritation or breed disgust. It seems that
the whites have not yet been able to realize and understand that these people in striving to
better their physical and social surroundings in accordance with their financial and intellectual
progress are simply obeying an impulse which is common to human nature the world over. I am
in grave doubt as to whether the greater part of the friction in the South is caused by the
whites' having a natural antipathy to Negroes as a race, or an acquired antipathy to Negroes
in certain relations to themselves. However that may be, there is to my mind no more pathetic
side of this many-sided question than the isolated position into which are forced the very
colored people who most need and who could best appreciate sympathetic cooperation; and their
position grows tragic when the effort is made to couple them, whether or no, with the Negroes
of the first class I mentioned.

This latter class of colored people are well-disposed towards the whites, and always willing
to meet them more than halfway. They, however, feel keenly any injustice or gross discrimination,
and generally show their resentment. The effort is sometimes made to convey the impression
that the better class of colored people fight against riding in "Jim Crow" cars because they
want to ride with white people or object to being with humbler members of their own race. The
truth is they object to the humiliation of being forced to ride in a particular car, aside
from the fact that that car is distinctly inferior, and that they are required to pay full
first-class fare. To say that the whites are forced to ride in the superior car is less than
a joke. And, too, odd as it may sound, refined colored people get no more pleasure out of riding
with offensive Negroes than anybody else would get.

I can realize more fully than I could years ago that the position of the advanced element of
the colored race is often very trying. They are the ones among the blacks who carry the entire
weight of the race question; it worries the others very little, and I believe the only thing
which at times sustains them is that they know that they are in the right. On the other hand,
this class of colored people get a good deal of pleasure out of life; their existence is far
from being one long groan about their condition. Out of a chaos of ignorance and poverty they
have evolved a social life of which they need not be ashamed. In cities where the professional
and well-to-do class is large they have formed society--society as discriminating as the actual
conditions will allow it to be; I should say, perhaps, society possessing discriminating tendencies
which become rules as fast as actual conditions allow. This statement will, I know, sound preposterous,
even ridiculous, to some persons; but as this class of colored people is the least known of
the race it is not surprising. These social circles are connected throughout the country, and
a person in good standing in one city is readily accepted in another. One who is on the outside
will often find it a difficult matter to get in. I know personally of one case in which money
to the extent of thirty or forty thousand dollars and a fine house, not backed up by a good
reputation, after several years of repeated effort, failed to gain entry for the possessor.
These people have their dances and dinners and card parties, their musicals, and their literary
societies. The women attend social affairs dressed in good taste, and the men in dress suits
which they own; and the reader will make a mistake to confound these entertainments with the
"Bellman's Balls" and "Whitewashers' Picnics" and "Lime-kiln Clubs" with which the humorous
press of the country illustrates "Cullud Sassiety."

Jacksonville, when I was there, was a small town, and the number of educated and well-to-do
colored people was small; so this society phase of life did not equal what I have since seen
in Boston, Washington, Richmond, and Nashville; and it is upon what I have more recently seen
in these cities that I have made the observations just above. However, there were many comfortable
and pleasant homes in Jacksonville to which I was often invited. I belonged to the literary
society--at which we generally discussed the race question--and attended all of the church
festivals and other charitable entertainments. In this way I passed three years which were
not at all the least enjoyable of my life. In fact, my joy took such an exuberant turn that
I fell in love with a young school teacher and began to have dreams of matrimonial bliss; but
another turn in the course of my life brought these dreams to an end.

I do not wish to mislead my readers into thinking that I led a life in Jacksonville which would
make copy for the hero of a Sunday-school library book. I was a hail fellow well met with all
of the workmen at the factory, most of whom knew little and cared less about social distinctions.
From their example I learned to be careless about money, and for that reason I constantly postponed
and finally abandoned returning to Atlanta University. It seemed impossible for me to save
as much as two hundred dollars. Several of the men at the factory were my intimate friends,
and I frequently joined them in their pleasures. During the summer months we went almost every
Monday on an excursion to a seaside resort called Pablo Beach. These excursions were always
crowded. There was a dancing pavilion, a great deal of drinking, and generally a fight or two
to add to the excitement. I also contracted the cigar maker's habit of riding around in a hack
on Sunday afternoons. I sometimes went with my cigar maker friends to public balls that were
given at a large hall on one of the main streets. I learned to take a drink occasionally and
paid for quite a number that my friends took; but strong liquors never appealed to my appetite.
I drank them only when the company I was in required it, and suffered for it afterwards. On
the whole, though I was a bit wild, I can't remember that I ever did anything disgraceful,
or, as the usual standard for young men goes, anything to forfeit my claim to respectability.

At one of the first public balls I attended I saw the Pullman car porter who had so kindly
assisted me in getting to Jacksonville. I went immediately to one of my factory friends and
borrowed fifteen dollars with which to repay the loan my benefactor had made me. After I had
given him the money, and was thanking him, I noticed that he wore what was, at least, an exact
duplicate of my lamented black and gray tie. It was somewhat worn, but distinct enough for
me to trace the same odd design which had first attracted my eye. This was enough to arouse
my strongest suspicions, but whether it was sufficient for the law to take cognizance of I
did not consider. My astonishment and the ironical humor of the situation drove everything
else out of my mind.

These balls were attended by a great variety of people. They were generally given by the waiters
of some one of the big hotels, and were often patronized by a number of hotel guests who came
to "see the sights." The crowd was always noisy, but good-natured; there was much quadrille-dancing,
and a strong-lunged man called figures in a voice which did not confine itself to the limits
of the hall. It is not worth the while for me to describe in detail how these people acted;
they conducted themselves in about the same manner as I have seen other people at similar balls
conduct themselves. When one has seen something of the world and human nature, one must conclude,
after all, that between people in like stations of life there is very little difference the
world over.

However, it was at one of these balls that I first saw the cake-walk. There was a contest for
a gold watch, to be awarded to the hotel head-waiter receiving the greatest number of votes.
There was some dancing while the votes were being counted. Then the floor was cleared for the
cake-walk. A half-dozen guests from some of the hotels took seats on the stage to act as judges,
and twelve or fourteen couples began to walk for a sure enough, highly decorated cake, which
was in plain evidence. The spectators crowded about the space reserved for the contestants
and watched them with interest and excitement. The couples did not walk round in a circle,
but in a square, with the men on the inside. The fine points to be considered were the bearing
of the men, the precision with which they turned the corners, the grace of the women, and the
ease with which they swung around the pivots. The men walked with stately and soldierly step,
and the women with considerable grace. The judges arrived at their decision by a process of
elimination. The music and the walk continued for some minutes; then both were stopped while
the judges conferred; when the walk began again, several couples were left out. In this way
the contest was finally narrowed down to three or four couples. Then the excitement became
intense; there was much partisan cheering as one couple or another would execute a turn in
extra elegant style. When the cake was finally awarded, the spectators were about evenly divided
between those who cheered the winners and those who muttered about the unfairness of the judges.
This was the cake-walk in its original form, and it is what the colored performers on the theatrical
stage developed into the prancing movements now known all over the world, and which some Parisian
critics pronounced the acme of poetic motion.

There are a great many colored people who are ashamed of the cake-walk, but I think they ought
to be proud of it. It is my opinion that the colored people of this country have done four
things which refute the oft-advanced theory that they are an absolutely inferior race, which
demonstrate that they have originality and artistic conception, and, what is more, the power
of creating that which can influence and appeal universally. The first two of these are the
Uncle Remus stories, collected by Joel Chandler Harris, and the Jubilee songs, to which the
Fisk singers made the public and the skilled musicians of both America and Europe listen. The
other two are ragtime music and the cake-walk. No one who has traveled can question the world-conquering
influence of ragtime, and I do not think it would be an exaggeration to say that in Europe
the United States is popularly known better by ragtime than by anything else it has produced
in a generation. In Paris they call it American music. The newspapers have already told how
the practice of intricate cake-walk steps has taken up the time of European royalty and nobility.
These are lower forms of art, but they give evidence of a power that will some day be applied
to the higher forms. In this measure, at least, and aside from the number of prominent individuals
the colored people of the United States have produced, the race has been a world influence;
and all of the Indians between Alaska and Patagonia haven't done as much.

Just when I was beginning to look upon Jacksonville as my permanent home and was beginning
to plan about marrying the young school teacher, raising a family, and working in a cigar factory
the rest of my life, for some reason, which I do not now remember, the factory at which I worked
was indefinitely shut down. Some of the men got work in other factories in town; some decided
to go to Key West and Tampa, others made up their minds to go to New York for work. All at
once a desire like a fever seized me to see the North again and I cast my lot with those bound
for New York.

VI

We steamed up into New York Harbor late one afternoon in spring. The last efforts of the sun
were being put forth in turning the waters of the bay to glistening gold; the green islands
on either side, in spite of their warlike mountings, looked calm and peaceful; the buildings
of the town shone out in a reflected light which gave the city an air of enchantment; and,
truly, it is an enchanted spot. New York City is the most fatally fascinating thing in America.
She sits like a great witch at the gate of the country, showing her alluring white face and
hiding her crooked hands and feet under the folds of her wide garments--constantly enticing
thousands from far within, and tempting those who come from across the seas to go no farther.
And all these become the victims of her caprice. Some she at once crushes beneath her cruel
feet; others she condemns to a fate like that of galley slaves; a few she favors and fondles,
riding them high on the bubbles of fortune; then with a sudden breath she blows the bubbles
out and laughs mockingly as she watches them fall.

Twice I had passed through it, but this was really my first visit to New York; and as I walked
about that evening, I began to feel the dread power of the city; the crowds, the lights, the
excitement, the gaiety, and all its subtler stimulating influences began to take effect upon
me. My blood ran quicker and I felt that I was just beginning to live. To some natures this
stimulant of life in a great city becomes a thing as binding and necessary as opium is to one
addicted to the habit. It becomes their breath of life; they cannot exist outside of it; rather
than be deprived of it they are content to suffer hunger, want, pain, and misery; they would
not exchange even a ragged and wretched condition among the great crowd for any degree of comfort
away from it.

As soon as we landed, four of us went directly to a lodging house in Twenty-seventh Street,
just west of Sixth Avenue. The house was run by a short, stout mulatto man, who was exceedingly
talkative and inquisitive. In fifteen minutes he not only knew the history of the past life
of each one of us, but had a clearer idea of what we intended to do in the future than we ourselves.
He sought this information so much with an air of being very particular as to whom he admitted
into his house that we tremblingly answered every question that he asked. When we had become
located, we went out and got supper, then walked around until about ten o'clock. At that hour
we met a couple of young fellows who lived in New York and were known to one of the members
of our party. It was suggested we go to a certain place which was known by the proprietor's
name. We turned into one of the cross streets and mounted the stoop of a house in about the
middle of a block between Sixth and Seventh Avenues. One of the young men whom we had met rang
a bell, and a man on the inside cracked the door a couple of inches; then opened it and let
us in. We found ourselves in the hallway of what had once been a residence. The front parlor
had been converted into a bar, and a half-dozen or so well-dressed men were in the room. We
went in and after a general introduction had several rounds of beer. In the back parlor a crowd
was sitting and standing around the walls of the room watching an exciting and noisy game of
pool. I walked back and joined this crowd to watch the game, and principally to get away from
the drinking party. The game was really interesting, the players being quite expert, and the
excitement was heightened by the bets which were being made on the result. At times the antics
and remarks of both players and spectators were amusing. When, at a critical point, a player
missed a shot, he was deluged, by those financially interested in his making it, with a flood
of epithets synonymous with "chump"; While from the others he would be jeered by such remarks
as "Nigger, dat cue ain't no hoe-handle." I noticed that among this class of colored men the
word "nigger" was freely used in about the same sense as the word "fellow," and sometimes as
a term of almost endearment; but I soon learned that its use was positively and absolutely
prohibited to white men.

I stood watching this pool game until I was called by my friends, who were still in the bar-room,
to go upstairs. On the second floor there were two large rooms. From the hall I looked into
the one on the front. There was a large, round table in the center, at which five or six men
were seated playing poker. The air and conduct here were greatly in contrast to what I had
just seen in the pool-room; these men were evidently the aristocrats of the place; they were
well, perhaps a bit flashily, dressed and spoke in low modulated voices, frequently using the
word "gentlemen"; in fact, they seemed to be practicing a sort of Chesterfieldian politeness
towards each other. I was watching these men with a great deal of interest and some degree
of admiration when I was again called by the members of our party, and I followed them on to
the back room. There was a door-keeper at this room, and we were admitted only after inspection.
When we got inside, I saw a crowd of men of all ages and kinds grouped about an old billiard
table, regarding some of whom, in supposing them to be white, I made no mistake. At first I
did not know what these men were doing; they were using terms that were strange to me. I could
hear only a confusion of voices exclaiming: "Shoot the two!" "Shoot the four!" "Fate me! Fate
me!" "I've got you fated!" "Twenty-five cents he don't turn!" This was the ancient and terribly
fascinating game of dice, popularly known as "craps." I myself had played pool in Jacksonville--it
is a favorite game among cigar makers--and I had seen others play cards; but here was something
new. I edged my way in to the table and stood between one of my new-found New York friends
and a tall, slender, black fellow, who was making side bets while the dice were at the other
end of the table. My companion explained to me the principles of the game; and they are so
simple that they hardly need to be explained twice. The dice came around the table until they
reached the man on the other side of the tall, black fellow. He lost, and the latter said:
"Gimme the bones." He threw a dollar on the table and said: "Shoot the dollar." His style of
play was so strenuous that he had to be allowed plenty of room. He shook the dice high above
his head, and each time he threw them on the table, he emitted a grunt such as men give when
they are putting forth physical exertion with a rhythmic regularity. He frequently whirled
completely around on his heels, throwing the dice the entire length of the table, and talking
to them as though they were trained animals. He appealed to them in short singsong phrases.
"Come, dice," he would say. "Little Phoebe," "Little Joe," "'Way down yonder in the cornfield."
Whether these mystic incantations were efficacious or not I could not say, but, at any rate,
his luck was great, and he had what gamblers term "nerve." "Shoot the dollar!" "Shoot the two!"
"Shoot the four!" "Shoot the eight!" came from his lips as quickly as the dice turned to his
advantage. My companion asked me if I had ever played. I told him no. He said that I ought
to try my luck: that everybody won at first. The tall man at my side was waving his arms in
the air, exclaiming: "Shoot the sixteen!" "Shoot the sixteen!" "Fate me!" Whether it was my
companion's suggestion or some latent dare-devil strain in my blood which suddenly sprang into
activity I do not know; but with a thrill of excitement which went through my whole body I
threw a twenty-dollar bill on the table and said in a trembling voice: "I fate you."

I could feel that I had gained the attention and respect of everybody in the room, every eye
was fixed on me, and the widespread question, "Who is he?" went around. This was gratifying
to a certain sense of vanity of which I have never been able to rid myself, and I felt that
it was worth the money even if I lost. The tall man, with a whirl on his heels and a double
grunt, threw the dice; four was the number which turned up. This is considered as a hard "point"
to make. He redoubled his contortions and his grunts and his pleadings to the dice; but on
his third or fourth throw the fateful seven turned up, and I had won. My companion and all
my friends shouted to me to follow up my luck. The fever was on me. I seized the dice. My hands
were so hot that the bits of bone felt like pieces of ice. I shouted as loudly as I could:
"Shoot it all!" but the blood was tingling so about my ears that I could not hear my own voice.
I was soon "fated." I threw the dice--sevens--I had won. "Shoot it all!" I cried again. There
was a pause; the stake was more than one man cared to or could cover. I was finally "fated"
by several men taking each a part of it. I then threw the dice again. Seven. I had won. "Shoot
it all!" I shouted excitedly. After a short delay I was "fated." Again I rolled the dice. Eleven.
Again I won. My friends now surrounded me and, much against my inclination, forced me to take
down all of the money except five dollars. I tried my luck once more, and threw some small
"point" which failed to make, and the dice passed on to the next man.

In less than three minutes I had won more than two hundred dollars, a sum which afterwards
cost me dearly. I was the hero of the moment and was soon surrounded by a group of men who
expressed admiration for my "nerve" and predicted for me a brilliant future as a gambler. Although
at the time I had no thought of becoming a gambler, I felt proud of my success. I felt a bit
ashamed, too, that I had allowed my friends to persuade me to take down my money so soon. Another
set of men also got around me and begged me for twenty-five or fifty cents to put them back
into the game. I gave each of them something. I saw that several of them had on linen dusters,
and as I looked about, I noticed that there were perhaps a dozen men in the room similarly
clad. I asked the fellow who had been my prompter at the dice table why they dressed in such
a manner. He told me that men who had lost all the money and jewelry they possessed, frequently,
in an effort to recoup their losses, would gamble away all their outer clothing and even their
shoes; and that the proprietor kept on hand a supply of linen dusters for all who were so unfortunate.
My informant went on to say that sometimes a fellow would become almost completely dressed
and then, by a turn of the dice, would be thrown back into a state of semi-nakedness. Some
of them were virtually prisoners and unable to get into the streets for days at a time. They
ate at the lunch counter, where their credit was good so long as they were fair gamblers and
did not attempt to jump their debts, and they slept around in chairs. They importuned friends
and winners to put them back in the game, and kept at it until fortune again smiled on them.
I laughed heartily at this, not thinking the day was coming which would find me in the same
ludicrous predicament.

On passing downstairs I was told that the third and top floor of the house was occupied by
the proprietor. When we passed through the bar, I treated everybody in the room--and that was
no small number, for eight or ten had followed us down. Then our party went out. It was now
about half past twelve, but my nerves were at such a tension that I could not endure the mere
thought of going to bed. I asked if there was no other place to which we could go; our guides
said yes, and suggested that we go to the "Club." We went to Sixth Avenue, walked two blocks,
and turned to the west into another street. We stopped in front of a house with three stories
and a basement. In the basement was a Chinese chop-suey restaurant. There was a red lantern
at the iron gate to the area way, inside of which the Chinaman's name was printed. We went
up the steps of the stoop, rang the bell, and were admitted without any delay. From the outside
the house bore a rather gloomy aspect, the windows being absolutely dark, but within, it was
a veritable house of mirth. When we had passed through a small vestibule and reached the hallway,
we heard mingled sounds of music and laughter, the clink of glasses, and the pop of bottles.
We went into the main room and I was little prepared for what I saw. The brilliancy of the
place, the display of diamond rings, scarf-pins, ear-rings, and breast-pins, the big rolls
of money that were brought into evidence when drinks were paid for, and the air of gaiety that
pervaded the place, all completely dazzled and dazed me. I felt positively giddy, and it was
several minutes before I was able to make any clear and definite observations.

We at length secured places at a table in a corner of the room and, as soon as we could attract
the attention of one of the busy waiters, ordered a round of drinks. When I had somewhat collected
my senses, I realized that in a large back room into which the main room opened, there was
a young fellow singing a song, accompanied on the piano by a short, thickset, dark man. After
each verse he did some dance steps, which brought forth great applause and a shower of small
coins at his feet. After the singer had responded to a rousing encore, the stout man at the
piano began to run his fingers up and down the keyboard. This he did in a manner which indicated
that he was master of a good deal of technique. Then he began to play; and such playing! I
stopped talking to listen. It was music of a kind I had never heard before. It was music that
demanded physical response, patting of the feet, drumming of the fingers, or nodding of the
head in time with the beat. The barbaric harmonies, the audacious resolutions, often consisting
of an abrupt jump from one key to another, the intricate rhythms in which the accents fell
in the most unexpected places, but in which the beat was never lost, produced a most curious
effect. And, too, the player--the dexterity of his left hand in making rapid octave runs and
jumps was little short of marvelous; and with his right hand he frequently swept half the keyboard
with clean-cut chromatics which he fitted in so nicely as never to fail to arouse in his listeners
a sort of pleasant surprise at the accomplishment of the feat.

This was ragtime music, then a novelty in New York, and just growing to be a rage, which has
not yet subsided. It was originated in the questionable resorts about Memphis and St. Louis
by Negro piano players who knew no more of the theory of music than they did of the theory
of the universe, but were guided by natural musical instinct and talent. It made its way to
Chicago, where it was popular some time before it reached New York. These players often improvised
crude and, at times, vulgar words to fit the melodies. This was the beginning of the ragtime
song. Several of these improvisations were taken down by white men, the words slightly altered,
and published under the names of the arrangers. They sprang into immediate popularity and earned
small fortunes, of which the Negro originators got only a few dollars. But I have learned that
since that time a number of colored men, of not only musical talent, but training, are writing
out their own melodies and words and reaping the reward of their work. I have learned also
that they have a large number of white imitators and adulterators.

American musicians, instead of investigating ragtime, attempt to ignore it, or dismiss it with
a contemptuous word. But that has always been the course of scholasticism in every branch of
art. Whatever new thing the people like is pooh-poohed; whatever is popular is spoken of as
not worth the while. The fact is, nothing great or enduring, especially in music, has ever
sprung full-fledged and unprecedented from the brain of any master; the best that he gives
to the world he gathers from the hearts of the people, and runs it through the alembic of his
genius. In spite of the bans which musicians and music teachers have placed upon it, the people
still demand and enjoy ragtime. One thing cannot be denied; it is music which possesses at
least one strong element of greatness: it appeals universally; not only the American, but the
English, the French, and even the German people find delight in it. In fact, there is not a
corner of the civilized world in which it is not known, and this proves its originality; for
if it were an imitation, the people of Europe, anyhow, would not have found it a novelty. Anyone
who doubts that there is a peculiar heel-tickling, smile-provoking, joy-awakening charm in
ragtime needs only to hear a skillful performer play the genuine article to be convinced. I
believe that it has its place as well as the music which draws from us sighs and tears.

I became so interested in both the music and the player that I left the table where I was sitting,
and made my way through the hall into the back room, where I could see as well as hear. I talked
to the piano-player between the musical numbers and found out that he was just a natural musician,
never having taken a lesson in his life. Not only could he play almost anything he heard, but
he could accompany singers in songs he had never heard. He had, by ear alone, composed some
pieces, several of which he played over for me; each of them was properly proportioned and
balanced. I began to wonder what this man with such a lavish natural endowment would have done
had he been trained. Perhaps he wouldn't have done anything at all; he might have become, at
best, a mediocre imitator of the great masters in what they have already done to a finish,
or one of the modern innovators who strive after originality by seeing how cleverly they can
dodge about through the rules of harmony and at the same time avoid melody. It is certain that
he would not have been so delightful as he was in ragtime.

I sat by, watching and listening to this man until I was dragged away by my friends. The place
was now almost deserted; only a few stragglers hung on, and they were all the, worse for drink.
My friends were well up in this class. We passed into the street; the lamps were pale against
the sky; day was just breaking. We went home and got into bed. I fell into a fitful sort of
sleep, with ragtime music ringing continually in my ears.

VII

I shall take advantage of this pause in my narrative to describe more closely the "Club" spoken
of in the latter part of the preceding chapter--to describe it as I afterwards came to know
it, as an habitué. I shall do this not only because of the direct influence it had on my life,
but also because it was at that time the most famous place of its kind in New York, and was
well known to both white and colored people of certain classes.

I have already stated that in the basement of the house there was a Chinese restaurant. The
Chinaman who kept it did an exceptionally good business; for chop-suey was a favorite dish
among the frequenters of the place. It is a food that, somehow, has the power of absorbing
alcoholic liquors that have been taken into the stomach. I have heard men claim that they could
sober up on chop-suey. Perhaps that accounted, in some degree, for its popularity. On the main
floor there were two large rooms: a parlor about thirty feet in length, and a large, square
back room into which the parlor opened. The floor of the parlor was carpeted; small tables
and chairs were arranged about the room; the windows were draped with lace curtains, and the
walls were literally covered with photographs or lithographs of every colored man in America
who had ever "done anything." There were pictures of Frederick Douglass and of Peter Jackson,
of all the lesser lights of the prize-fighting ring, of all the famous jockeys and the stage
celebrities, down to the newest song and dance team. The most of these photographs were autographed
and, in a sense, made a really valuable collection. In the back room there was a piano, and
tables were placed around the wall. The floor was bare and the center was left vacant for singers,
dancers, and others who entertained the patrons. In a closet in this room which jutted out
into the hall the proprietor kept his buffet. There was no open bar, because the place had
no liquor license. In this back room the tables were sometimes pushed aside, and the floor
given over to general dancing. The front room on the next floor was a sort of private party
room; a back room on the same floor contained no furniture and was devoted to the use of new
and ambitious performers. In this room song and dance teams practiced their steps, acrobatic
teams practiced their tumbles, and many other kinds of "acts" rehearsed their "turns." The
other rooms of the house were used as sleeping-apartments.

No gambling was allowed, and the conduct of the place was surprisingly orderly. It was, in
short, a center of colored Bohemians and sports. Here the great prize fighters were wont to
come, the famous jockeys, the noted minstrels, whose names and faces were familiar on every
bill-board in the country; and these drew a multitude of those who love to dwell in the shadow
of greatness. There were then no organizations giving performances of such order as are now
given by several colored companies; that was because no manager could imagine that audiences
would pay to see Negro performers in any other role than that of Mississippi River roustabouts;
but there was lots of talent and ambition. I often heard the younger and brighter men discussing
the time when they would compel the public to recognize that they could do something more than
grin and cut pigeon-wings.

Sometimes one or two of the visiting stage professionals, after being sufficiently urged, would
go into the back room and take the places of the regular amateur entertainers, but they were
very sparing with these favors, and the patrons regarded them as special treats. There was
one man, a minstrel, who, whenever he responded to a request to "do something," never essayed
anything below a reading from Shakespeare. How well he read I do not know, but he greatly impressed
me; and I can say that at least he had a voice which strangely stirred those who heard it.
Here was a man who made people laugh at the size of his mouth, while he carried in his heart
a burning ambition to be a tragedian; and so after all he did play a part in a tragedy.

These notables of the ring, the turf, and the stage, drew to the place crowds of admirers,
both white and colored. Whenever one of them came in, there were awe-inspired whispers from
those who knew him by sight, in which they enlightened those around them as to his identity,
and hinted darkly at their great intimacy with the noted one. Those who were on terms of approach
immediately showed their privilege over others less fortunate by gathering around their divinity.
I was, at first, among those who dwelt in darkness. Most of these celebrities I had never heard
of. This made me an object of pity among many of my new associates. I soon learned, however,
to fake a knowledge for the benefit of those who were greener than I; and, finally, I became
personally acquainted with the majority of the famous personages who came to the "Club."

A great deal of money was spent here, so many of the patrons were men who earned large sums.
I remember one night a dapper little brown-skin fellow was pointed out to me and I was told
that he was the most popular jockey of the day, and that he earned $12,000 a year. This latter
statement I couldn't doubt, for with my own eyes I saw him spending at about thirty times that
rate. For his friends and those who were introduced to him he bought nothing but wine--in sporting
circles, "wine" means champagne--and paid for it at five dollars a quart. He sent a quart to
every table in the place with his compliments; and on the table at which he and his party were
seated there were more than a dozen bottles. It was the custom at the "Club" for the waiter
not to remove the bottles when champagne was being drunk until the party had finished. There
were reasons for this; it advertised the brand of wine, it advertised that the party was drinking
wine, and advertised how much they had bought. This jockey had won a great race that day, and
he was rewarding his admirers for the homage they paid him, all of which he accepted with a
fine air of condescension.

Besides the people I have just been describing, there was at the place almost every night one
or two parties of white people, men and women, who were out sight-seeing, or slumming. They
generally came in cabs; some of them would stay only for a few minutes, while others sometimes
stayed until morning. There was also another set of white people who came frequently; it was
made up of variety performers and others who delineated "darky characters"; they came to get
their imitations first hand from the Negro entertainers they saw there.

There was still another set of white patrons, composed of women; these were not occasional
visitors, but five or six of them were regular habituées. When I first saw them, I was not
sure that they were white. In the first place, among the many colored women who came to the
"Club" there were several just as fair; and, secondly, I always saw these women in company
with colored men. They were all good-looking and well-dressed, and seemed to be women of some
education. One of these in particular attracted my attention; she was an exceedingly beautiful
woman of perhaps thirty-five; she had glistening copper-colored hair, very white skin, and
eyes very much like Du Maurier's conception of Trilby's "twin gray stars." When I came to know
her, I found that she was a woman of considerable culture; she had traveled in Europe, spoke
French, and played the piano well. She was always dressed elegantly, but in absolute good taste.
She always came to the "Club" in a cab, and was soon joined by a well-set-up, very black young
fellow. He was always faultlessly dressed; one of the most exclusive tailors in New York made
his clothes, and he wore a number of diamonds in about as good taste as they could be worn
in by a man. I learned that she paid for his clothes and his diamonds. I learned, too, that
he was not the only one of his kind. More that I learned would be better suited to a book on
social phenomena than to a narrative of my life.

This woman was known at the "Club" as the rich widow. She went by a very aristocratic-sounding
name, which corresponded to her appearance. I shall never forget how hard it was for me to
get over my feelings of surprise, perhaps more than surprise, at seeing her with her black
companion; somehow I never exactly enjoyed the sight. I have devoted so much time to this pair,
the "widow" and her companion, because it was through them that another decided turn was brought
about in my life.

VIII

On the day following our night at the "Club" we slept until late in the afternoon; so late
that beginning search for work was entirely out of the question. This did not cause me much
worry, for I had more than three hundred dollars, and New York had impressed me as a place
where there was lots of money and not much difficulty in getting it. It is needless to inform
my readers that I did not long hold this opinion. We got out of the house about dark, went
to a restaurant on Sixth Avenue and ate something, then walked around for a couple of hours.
I finally suggested that we visit the same places we had been in the night before. Following
my suggestion, we started first to the gambling house. The man on the door let us in without
any question; I accredited this to my success of the night before. We went straight to the
"crap" room, and I at once made my way to a table, where I was rather flattered by the murmur
of recognition which went around. I played in up and down luck for three or four hours; then,
worn with nervous excitement, quit, having lost about fifty dollars. But I was so strongly
possessed with the thought that I would make up my losses the next time I played that I left
the place with a light heart.

When we got into the street our party was divided against itself; two were for going home at
once and getting to bed. They gave as a reason that we were to get up early and look for jobs.
I think the real reason was that they had each lost several dollars in the game. I lived to
learn that in the world of sport all men win alike, but lose differently; and so gamblers are
rated, not by the way in which they win, but by the way in which they lose. Some men lose with
a careless smile, recognizing that losing is a part of the game; others curse their luck and
rail at fortune; and others, still, lose sadly; after each such experience they are swept by
a wave of reform; they resolve to stop gambling and be good. When in this frame of mind it
would take very little persuasion to lead them into a prayer-meeting. Those in the first class
are looked upon with admiration; those in the second class are merely commonplace; while those
in the third are regarded with contempt. I believe these distinctions hold good in all the
ventures of life. After some minutes one of my friends and I succeeded in convincing the other
two that a while at the "Club" would put us all in better spirits; and they consented to go,
on our promise not to stay longer than an hour. We found the place crowded, and the same sort
of thing going on which we had seen the night before. I took a seat at once by the side of
the piano player, and was soon lost to everything except the novel charm of the music. I watched
the performer with the idea of catching the trick, and during one of his intermissions I took
his place at the piano and made an attempt to imitate him, but even my quick ear and ready
fingers were unequal to the task on first trial.

We did not stay at the "Club" very long, but went home to bed in order to be up early the next
day. We had no difficulty in finding work, and my third morning in New York found me at a table
rolling cigars. I worked steadily for some weeks, at the same time spending my earnings between
the "crap" game and the "Club." Making cigars became more and more irksome to me; perhaps my
more congenial work as a "reader" had unfitted me for work at the table. And, too, the late
hours I was keeping made such a sedentary occupation almost beyond the powers of will and endurance.
I often found it hard to keep my eyes open and sometimes had to get up and move around to keep
from falling asleep. I began to miss whole days from the factory, days on which I was compelled
to stay at home and sleep.

My luck at the gambling table was varied; sometimes I was fifty to a hundred dollars ahead,
and at other times I had to borrow money from my fellow workmen to settle my room rent and
pay for my meals. Each night after leaving the dice game I went to the "Club" to hear the music
and watch the gaiety. If I had won, this was in accord with my mood; if I had lost, it made
me forget. I at last realized that making cigars for a living and gambling for a living could
not both be carried on at the same time, and I resolved to give up the cigar making. This resolution
led me into a life which held me bound more than a year. During that period my regular time
for going to bed was somewhere between four and six o'clock in the mornings. I got up late
in the afternoons, walked about a little, then went to the gambling house or the "Club." My
New York was limited to ten blocks; the boundaries were Sixth Avenue from Twenty-third to Thirty-third
Streets, with the cross streets one block to the west. Central Park was a distant forest, and
the lower part of the city a foreign land. I look back upon the life I then led with a shudder
when I think what would have been had I not escaped it. But had I not escaped it, I should
have been no more unfortunate than are many young colored men who come to New York. During
that dark period I became acquainted with a score of bright, intelligent young fellows who
had come up to the great city with high hopes and ambitions and who had fallen under the spell
of this under life, a spell they could not throw off. There was one popularly known as "the
doctor"; he had had two years in the Harvard Medical School, but here he was, living this gas-light
life, his will and moral sense so enervated and deadened that it was impossible for him to
break away. I do not doubt that the same thing is going on now, but I have sympathy rather
than censure for these victims, for I know how easy it is to slip into a slough from which
it takes a herculean effort to leap.

I regret that I cannot contrast my views of life among colored people of New York; but the
truth is, during my entire stay in this city I did not become acquainted with a single respectable
family. I knew that there were several colored men worth a hundred or so thousand dollars each,
and some families who proudly dated their free ancestry back a half-dozen generations. I also
learned that in Brooklyn there lived quite a large colony in comfortable homes which they owned;
but at no point did my life come in contact with theirs.

In my gambling experiences I passed through all the states and conditions that a gambler is
heir to. Some days found me able to peel ten and twenty-dollar bills from a roll, and others
found me clad in a linen duster and carpet slippers. I finally caught up another method of
earning money, and so did not have to depend entirely upon the caprices of fortune at the gaming
table. Through continually listening to the music at the "Club," and through my own previous
training, my natural talent and perseverance, I developed into a remarkable player of ragtime;
indeed, I had the name at that time of being the best ragtime-player in New York. I brought
all my knowledge of classic music to bear and, in so doing, achieved some novelties which pleased
and even astonished my listeners. It was I who first made ragtime transcriptions of familiar
classic selections. I used to play Mendelssohn's "Wedding March" in a manner that never failed
to arouse enthusiasm among the patrons of the "Club." Very few nights passed during which I
was not asked to play it. It was no secret that the great increase in slumming visitors was
due to my playing. By mastering ragtime I gained several things: first of all, I gained the
title of professor. I was known as "the professor" as long as I remained in that world. Then,
too, I gained the means of earning a rather fair livelihood. This work took up much of my time
and kept me almost entirely away from the gambling table. Through it I also gained a friend
who was the means by which I escaped from this lower world. And, finally, I secured a wedge
which has opened to me more doors and made me a welcome guest than my playing of Beethoven
and Chopin could ever have done.

The greater part of the money I now began to earn came through the friend to whom I alluded
in the foregoing paragraph. Among the other white "slummers" there came into the "Club" one
night a clean-cut, slender, but athletic-looking man, who would have been taken for a youth
had it not been for the tinge of gray about his temples. He was clean-shaven and had regular
features, and all of his movements bore the indefinable but unmistakable stamp of culture.
He spoke to no one, but sat languidly puffing cigarettes and sipping a glass of beer. He was
the center of a great deal of attention; all of the old-timers were wondering who he was. When
I had finished playing, he called a waiter and by him sent me a five-dollar bill. For about
a month after that he was at the "Club" one or two nights each week, and each time after I
had played, he gave me five dollars. One night he sent for me to come to his table; he asked
me several questions about myself; then told me that he had an engagement which he wanted me
to fill. He gave me a card containing his address and asked me to be there on a certain night.

I was on hand promptly and found that he was giving a dinner in his own apartments to a party
of ladies and gentlemen and that I was expected to furnish the musical entertainment. When
the grave, dignified man at the door let me in, the place struck me as being almost dark, my
eyes had been so accustomed to the garish light of the "Club." He took my coat and hat, bade
me take a seat, and went to tell his master that I had come. When my eyes were adjusted to
the soft light, I saw that I was in the midst of elegance and luxury in a degree such as I
had never seen; but not the elegance which makes one ill at ease. As I sank into a great chair,
the subdued tone, the delicately sensuous harmony of my surroundings, drew from me a deep sigh
of relief and comfort. How long the man was gone I do not know, but I was startled by a voice
saying: "Come this way, if you please, sir," and I saw him standing by my chair. I had been
asleep; and I awoke very much confused and a little ashamed, because I did not know how many
times he may have called me. I followed him through into the dining-room, where the butler
was putting the finishing touches to a table which already looked like a big jewel. The doorman
turned me over to the butler, and I passed with the butler on back to where several waiters
were busy polishing and assorting table utensils. Without being asked whether I was hungry
or not, I was placed at a table and given something to eat. Before I had finished eating, I
heard the laughter and talk of the guests who were arriving. Soon afterwards I was called in
to begin my work.

I passed in to where the company was gathered and went directly to the piano. According to
a suggestion from the host, I began with classic music. Some doubt still rely on Egyptian chronology.
For some antiquaries, this ring was allegedly worn by pharaoh who ruled over the land while
Joseph was prime minister, but others, as mentioned, the reign of Amenophis I place after Israel's departure.

The other is a tiara of gold, about seven inches in diameter, taken from the head of a mummy. In
the center stands a pyramid with a Double Cartouche on one side and one on the other hand. Towards
this twelve scarabÃ¦i approaching six on each side, emblematic of the growth and decrease days in
twelve months, and between them is a procession of boats, and figures are deities. In the inner
part of the diadem are the signs of the zodiac.
Among the jewels in this collection we find more gold necklaces worth, coral, and precious stones.
Besides Egypt, are some of Etruscan origin, taken from the tombs of the ancient people. We
can not leave this subject without noticing the beauty and perfection filigree work, executed about
2400 years ago, and equal in modern labor. Some outstanding examples of Pompeii are preserved
here.
Turning to the walls of this apartment, we found cases in glass vases
filled with clay and alabaster east. On some of them are royal names,
gilt and colored, and that of Khufu, builder Great Pyramid, is the
one. He seemed to take cynical delight in watching and studying
others indulging in excess. His guests were evidently accustomed to his rather non-participating
attitude, for it did not seem in any degree to dampen their spirits.

When dinner was served, the piano was moved and the door left open, so that the company might
hear the music while eating. At a word from the host I struck up one of my liveliest ragtime
pieces. The effect was surprising, perhaps even to the host; the ragtime music came very near
spoiling the party so far as eating the dinner was concerned. As soon as I began, the conversation
suddenly stopped. It was a pleasure to me to watch the expression of astonishment and delight
that grew on the faces of everybody. These were people--and they represented a large class--who
were ever expecting to find happiness in novelty, each day restlessly exploring and exhausting
every resource of this great city that might possibly furnish a new sensation or awaken a fresh
emotion, and who were always grateful to anyone who aided them in their quest. Several of the
women left the table and gathered about the piano. They watched my fingers and asked what kind
of music it was that I was playing, where I had learned it, and a host of other questions.
It was only by being repeatedly called back to the table that they were induced to finish their
dinner. When the guests arose, I struck up my ragtime transcription of Mendelssohn's "Wedding
March," playing it with terrific chromatic octave runs in the bass. This raised everybody's
spirits to the highest point of gaiety, and the whole company involuntarily and unconsciously
did an impromptu cake-walk. From that time on until the time of leaving they kept me so busy
that my arms ached. I obtained a little respite when the girlish-looking youth and one or two
of the ladies sang several songs, but after each of these it was "back to ragtime."

In leaving, the guests were enthusiastic in telling the host that he had furnished them the
most unusual entertainment they had ever enjoyed. When they had gone, my millionaire friend--for
he was reported to be a millionaire--said to me with a smile: "Well, I have given them something
they've never had before." After I had put on my coat and was ready to leave, he made me take
a glass of wine; he then gave me a cigar and twenty dollars in bills. He told me that he would
give me lots of work, his only stipulation being that I should not play any engagements such
as I had just filled for him, except by his instructions. I readily accepted the proposition,
for I was sure that I could not be the loser by such a contract. I afterwards played for him
at many dinners and parties of one kind or another. Occasionally he "loaned" me to some of
his friends. And, too, I often played for him alone at his apartments. At such times he was
quite a puzzle to me until I became accustomed to his manners. He would sometimes sit for three
or four hours hearing me play, his eyes almost closed, making scarcely a motion except to light
a fresh cigarette, and never commenting one way or another on the music. At first I sometimes
thought he had fallen asleep and would pause in playing. The stopping of the music always aroused
him enough to tell me to play this or that; and I soon learned that my task was not to be considered
finished until he got up from his chair and said: "That will do." The man's powers of endurance
in listening often exceeded mine in performing--yet I am not sure that he was always listening.
At times I became so oppressed with fatigue and sleepiness that it took almost superhuman effort
to keep my fingers going; in fact, I believe I sometimes did so while dozing. During such moments
this man sitting there so mysteriously silent, almost hid in a cloud of heavy-scented smoke,
filled me with a sort of unearthly terror. He seemed to be some grim, mute, but relentless
tyrant, possessing over me a supernatural power which he used to drive me on mercilessly to
exhaustion. But these feelings came very rarely; besides, he paid me so liberally I could forget
much. There at length grew between us a familiar and warm relationship, and I am sure he had
a decided personal liking for me. On my part, I looked upon him at that time as about all a
man could wish to be.

The "Club" still remained my headquarters, and when I was not playing for my good patron, I
was generally to be found there. However, I no longer depended on playing at the "Club" to
earn my living; I rather took rank with the visiting celebrities and, occasionally, after being
sufficiently urged, would favor my old and new admirers with a number or two. I say, without
any egotistic pride, that among my admirers were several of the best-looking women who frequented
the place, and who made no secret of the fact that they admired me as much as they did my playing.
Among these was the "widow"; indeed, her attentions became so marked that one of my friends
warned me to beware of her black companion, who was generally known as a "bad man." He said
there was much more reason to be careful because the pair had lately quarreled and had not
been together at the "Club" for some nights. This warning greatly impressed me and I resolved
to stop the affair before it should go any further; but the woman was so beautiful that my
native gallantry and delicacy would not allow me to repulse her; my finer feelings entirely
overcame my judgment. The warning also opened my eyes sufficiently to see that though my artistic
temperament and skill made me interesting and attractive to the woman, she was, after all,
using me only to excite the jealousy of her companion and revenge herself upon him. It was
this surly, black despot who held sway over her deepest emotions.

One night, shortly afterwards, I went into the "Club" and saw the "widow" sitting at a table
in company with another woman. She at once beckoned for me to come to her. I went, knowing
that I was committing worse than folly. She ordered a quart of champagne and insisted that
I sit down and drink with her. I took a chair on the opposite side of the table and began to
sip a glass of the wine. Suddenly I noticed by an expression on the "widow's" face that something
had occurred.

I instinctively glanced around and saw that her companion had just entered. His ugly look completely
frightened me. My back was turned to him, but by watching the "widow's" eyes I judged that
he was pacing back and forth across the room. My feelings were far from being comfortable;
I expected every moment to feel a blow on my head. She, too, was very nervous; she was trying
hard to appear unconcerned, but could not succeed in hiding her real feelings. I decided that
it was best to get out of such a predicament even at the expense of appearing cowardly, and
I made a motion to rise. Just as I partly turned in my chair, I saw the black fellow approaching;
he walked directly to our table and leaned over. The "widow" evidently feared he was going
to strike her, and she threw back her head. Instead of striking her he whipped out a revolver
and fired; the first shot went straight into her throat. There were other shots fired, but
how many I do not know; for the first knowledge I had of my surroundings and actions was that
I was rushing through the chop-suey restaurant into the street. Just which streets I followed
when I got outside I do not know, but I think I must have gone towards Eighth Avenue, then
down towards Twenty-third Street and across towards Fifth Avenue. I traveled, not by sight,
but instinctively. I felt like one fleeing in a horrible nightmare.

How long and far I walked I cannot tell; but on Fifth Avenue, under a light, I passed a cab
containing a solitary occupant, who called to me, and I recognized the voice and face of my
millionaire friend. He stopped the cab and asked: "What on earth are you doing strolling in
this part of the town?" For answer I got into the cab and related to him all that had happened.
He reassured me by saying that no charge of any kind could be brought against me; then added:
"But of course you don't want to be mixed up in such an affair." He directed the driver to
turn around and go into the park, and then went on to say: "I decided last night that I'd go
to Europe tomorrow. I think I'll take you along instead of Walter." Walter was his valet. It
was settled that I should go to his apartments for the rest of the night and sail with him
in the morning.

We drove around through the park, exchanging only an occasional word. The cool air somewhat
calmed my nerves and I lay back and closed my eyes; but still I could see that beautiful white
throat with the ugly wound. The jet of blood pulsing from it had placed an indelible red stain
on my memory.

IX

I did not feel at ease until the ship was well out of New York harbor; and, notwithstanding
the repeated reassurances of my millionaire friend and my own knowledge of the facts in the
case, I somehow could not rid myself of the sentiment that I was, in a great degree, responsible
for the "widow's" tragic end. We had brought most of the morning papers aboard with us, but
my great fear of seeing my name in connection with the killing would not permit me to read
the accounts, although, in one of the papers, I did look at the picture of the victim, which
did not in the least resemble her. This morbid state of mind, together with sea-sickness, kept
me miserable for three or four days. At the end of that time my spirits began to revive, and
I took an interest in the ship, my fellow passengers, and the voyage in general. On the second
or third day out we passed several spouting whales, but I could not arouse myself to make the
effort to go to the other side of the ship to see them. A little later we ran in close proximity
to a large iceberg. I was curious enough to get up and look at it, and I was fully repaid for
my pains. The sun was shining full upon it, and it glistened like a mammoth diamond, cut with
a million facets. As we passed, it constantly changed its shape; at each different angle of
vision it assumed new and astonishing forms of beauty. I watched it through a pair of glasses,
seeking to verify my early conception of an iceberg--in the geographies of my grammar school
days the pictures of icebergs always included a stranded polar bear, standing desolately upon
one of the snowy crags. I looked for the bear, but if he was there, he refused to put himself
on exhibition.

It was not, however, until the morning that we entered the harbor of Havre that I was able
to shake off my gloom. Then the strange sights, the chatter in an unfamiliar tongue, and the
excitement of landing and passing the customs officials caused me to forget completely the
events of a few days before. Indeed, I grew so lighthearted that when I caught my first sight
of the train which was to take us to Paris, I enjoyed a hearty laugh. The toy-looking engine,
the stuffy little compartment cars, with tiny, old-fashioned wheels, struck me as being extremely
funny. But before we reached Paris my respect for our train rose considerably. I found that
the "tiny" engine made remarkably fast time, and that the old-fashioned wheels ran very smoothly.
I even began to appreciate the "stuffy" cars for their privacy. As I watched the passing scenery
from the car window, it seemed too beautiful to be real. The bright-colored houses against
the green background impressed me as the work of some idealistic painter. Before we arrived
in Paris, there was awakened in my heart a love for France which continued to grow stronger,
a love which to-day makes that country for me the one above all others to be desired.

We rolled into the station Saint Lazare about four o'clock in the afternoon and drove immediately
to the Hôtel Continental. My benefactor, humoring my curiosity and enthusiasm, which seemed
to please him very much, suggested that we take a short walk before dinner. We stepped out
of the hotel and turned to the right into the rue de Rivoli. When the vista of the Place de
la Concorde and the Champs Élysées suddenly burst on me, I could hardly credit my own eyes.
I shall attempt no such supererogatory task as a description of Paris. I wish only to give
briefly the impressions which that wonderful city made upon me. It impressed me as the perfect
and perfectly beautiful city; and even after I had been there for some time, and seen not only
its avenues and palaces, but its most squalid alleys and hovels, this impression was not weakened.
Paris became for me a charmed spot, and whenever I have returned there, I have fallen under
the spell, a spell which compels admiration for all of its manners and customs and justification
of even its follies and sins.

We walked a short distance up the Champs Élysées and sat for a while in chairs along the sidewalk,
watching the passing crowds on foot and in carriages. It was with reluctance that I went back
to the hotel for dinner. After dinner we went to one of the summer theatres, and after the
performance my friend took me to a large café on one of the Grands Boulevards. Here it was
that I had my first glimpse of the French life of popular literature, so different from real
French life. There were several hundred people, men and women, in the place drinking, smoking,
talking, and listening to the music. My millionaire friend and I took seats at a table, where
we sat smoking and watching the crowd. It was not long before we were joined by two or three
good-looking, well-dressed young women. My friend talked to them in French and bought drinks
for the whole party. I tried to recall my high-school French, but the effort availed me little.
I could stammer out a few phrases, but, very naturally, could not understand a word that was
said to me. We stayed at the café a couple of hours, then went back to the hotel. The next
day we spent several hours in the shops and at the tailor's. I had no clothes except what I
had been able to gather together at my benefactor's apartments the night before we sailed.
He bought me the same kind of clothes which he himself wore, and that was the best; and he
treated me in every way as he dressed me, as an equal, not as a servant. In fact, I don't think
anyone could have guessed that such a relation existed. My duties were light and few, and he
was a man full of life and vigor, who rather enjoyed doing things for himself. He kept me supplied
with money far beyond what ordinary wages would have amounted to. For the first two weeks we
were together almost constantly, seeing the sights, sights old to him, but from which he seemed
to get new pleasure in showing them to me. During the day we took in the places of interest,
and at night the theatres and cafés. This sort of life appealed to me as ideal, and I asked
him one day how long he intended to stay in Paris. He answered: "Oh, until I get tired of it."
I could not understand how that could ever happen. As it was, including several short trips
to the Mediterranean, to Spain, to Brussels, and to Ostend, we did remain there fourteen or
fifteen months. We stayed at the Hôtel Continental about two months of this time. Then my millionaire
took apartments, hired a piano, and lived almost the same life he lived in New York. He entertained
a great deal, some of the parties being a good deal more blasé than the New York ones. I played
for the guests at all of them with an effect which to relate would be but a tiresome repetition
to the reader. I played not only for the guests, but continued, as I used to do in New York,
to play often for the host when he was alone. This man of the world, who grew weary of everything
and was always searching for something new, appeared never to grow tired of my music; he seemed
to take it as a drug. He fell into a habit which caused me no little annoyance; sometimes he
would come in during the early hours of the morning and, finding me in bed asleep, would wake
me up and ask me to play something. This, so far as I can remember, was my only hardship during
my whole stay with him in Europe.

After the first few weeks spent in sight-seeing I had a great deal of time left to myself;
my friend was often I did not know where. When not with him, I spent the day nosing about all
the curious nooks and corners of Paris; of this I never grew tired. At night I usually went
to some theatre, but always ended up at the big café on the Grands Boulevards. I wish the reader
to know that it was not alone the gaiety which drew me there; aside from that I had a laudable
purpose. I had purchased an English-French conversational dictionary, and I went there every
night to take a language lesson. I used to get three or four of the young women who frequented
the place at a table and buy beer and cigarettes for them. In return I received my lesson.
I got more than my money's worth, for they actually compelled me to speak the language. This,
together with reading the papers every day, enabled me within a few months to express myself
fairly well, and, before I left Paris, to have more than an ordinary command of French. Of
course, every person who goes to Paris could not dare to learn French in this manner, but I
can think of no easier or quicker way of doing it. The acquiring of another foreign language
awoke me to the fact that with a little effort I could secure an added accomplishment as fine
and as valuable as music; so I determined to make myself as much of a linguist as possible.
I bought a Spanish newspaper every day in order to freshen my memory of that language, and,
for French, devised what was, so far as I knew, an original system of study. I compiled a list
which I termed "Three hundred necessary words." These I thoroughly committed to memory, also
the conjugation of the verbs which were included in the list. I studied these words over and
over, much as children of a couple of generations ago studied the alphabet. I also practiced
a set of phrases like the following: "How?" "What did you say?" "What does the word ---- mean?"
"I understand all you say except ----." "Please repeat." "What do you call ----?" "How do you
say ----?" These I called my working sentences. In an astonishingly short time I reached the
point where the language taught itself--where I learned to speak merely by speaking. This point
is the place which students taught foreign languages in our schools and colleges find great
difficulty in reaching. I think the main trouble is that they learn too much of a language
at a time. A French child with a vocabulary of two hundred words can express more spoken ideas
than a student of French can with a knowledge of two thousand. A small vocabulary, the smaller
the better, which embraces the common, everyday-used ideas, thoroughly mastered, is the key
to a language. When that much is acquired the vocabulary can be increased simply by talking.
And it is easy. Who cannot commit three hundred words to memory? Later I tried my method, if
I may so term it, with German, and found that it worked in the same way.

I spent a good many evenings at the Opéra. The music there made me strangely reminiscent of
my life in Connecticut; it was an atmosphere in which I caught a fresh breath of my boyhood
days and early youth. Generally, in the morning after I had attended a performance, I would
sit at the piano and for a couple of hours play the music which I used to play in my mother's
little parlor.

One night I went to hear Faust. I got into my seat just as the lights went down for the first
act. At the end of the act I noticed that my neighbor on the left was a young girl. I cannot
describe her either as to feature, or color of her hair, or of her eyes; she was so young,
so fair, so ethereal, that I felt to stare at her would be a violation; yet I was distinctly
conscious of her beauty. During the intermission she spoke English in a low voice to a gentleman
and a lady who sat in the seats to her left, addressing them as father and mother. I held my
program as though studying it, but listened to catch every sound of her voice. Her observations
on the performance and the audience were so fresh and naïve as to be almost amusing. I gathered
that she was just out of school, and that this was her first trip to Paris. I occasionally
stole a glance at her, and each time I did so my heart leaped into my throat. Once I glanced
beyond to the gentleman who sat next to her. My glance immediately turned into a stare. Yes,
there he was, unmistakably, my father! looking hardly a day older than when I had seen him
some ten years before. What a strange coincidence! What should I say to him? What would he
say to me? Before I had recovered from my first surprise, there came another shock in the realization
that the beautiful, tender girl at my side was my sister. Then all the springs of affection
in my heart, stopped since my mother's death, burst out in fresh and terrible torrents, and
I could have fallen at her feet and worshiped her. They were singing the second act, but I
did not hear the music. Slowly the desolate loneliness of my position became clear to me. I
knew that I could not speak, but I would have given a part of my life to touch her hand with
mine and call her "sister." I sat through the opera until I could stand it no longer. I felt
that I was suffocating. Valentine's love seemed like mockery, and I felt an almost uncontrollable
impulse to rise up and scream to the audience: "Here, here in your very midst, is a tragedy,
a real tragedy!" This impulse grew so strong that I became afraid of myself, and in the darkness
of one of the scenes I stumbled out of the theatre. I walked aimlessly about for an hour or
so, my feelings divided between a desire to weep and a desire to curse. I finally took a cab
and went from café to café, and for one of the very few times in my life drank myself into
a stupor.

It was unwelcome news for me when my benefactor--I could not think of him as employer--informed
me that he was at last tired of Paris. This news gave me, I think, a passing doubt as to his
sanity. I had enjoyed life in Paris, and, taking all things into consideration, enjoyed it
wholesomely. One thing which greatly contributed to my enjoyment was the fact that I was an
American. Americans are immensely popular in Paris; and this is not due solely to the fact
that they spend lots of money there, for they spend just as much or more in London, and in
the latter city they are merely tolerated because they do spend. The Londoner seems to think
that Americans are people whose only claim to be classed as civilized is that they have money,
and the regrettable thing about that is that the money is not English. But the French are more
logical and freer from prejudices than the British; so the difference of attitude is easily
explained. Only once in Paris did I have cause to blush for my American citizenship. I had
become quite friendly with a young man from Luxemburg whom I had met at the big café. He was
a stolid, slow-witted fellow, but, as we say, with a heart of gold. He and I grew attached
to each other and were together frequently. He was a great admirer of the United States and
never grew tired of talking to me about the country and asking for information. It was his
intention to try his fortune there some day. One night he asked me in a tone of voice which
indicated that he expected an authoritative denial of an ugly rumor: "Did they really burn
a man alive in the United States?" I never knew what I stammered out to him as an answer. I
should have felt relieved if I could even have said to him: "Well, only one."

When we arrived in London, my sadness at leaving Paris was turned into despair. After my long
stay in the French capital, huge, ponderous, massive London seemed to me as ugly a thing as
man could contrive to make. I thought of Paris as a beauty spot on the face of the earth, and
of London as a big freckle. But soon London's massiveness, I might say its very ugliness, began
to impress me. I began to experience that sense of grandeur which one feels when he looks at
a great mountain or a mighty river. Beside London Paris becomes a toy, a pretty plaything.
And I must own that before I left the world's metropolis I discovered much there that was beautiful.
The beauty in and about London is entirely different from that in and about Paris; and I could
not but admit that the beauty of the French city seemed hand-made, artificial, as though set
up for the photographer's camera, everything nicely adjusted so as not to spoil the picture;
while that of the English city was rugged, natural, and fresh.

How these two cities typify the two peoples who built them! Even the sound of their names expresses
a certain racial difference. Paris is the concrete expression of the gaiety, regard for symmetry,
love of art, and, I might well add, of the morality of the French people. London stands for
the conservatism, the solidarity, the utilitarianism, and, I might well add, the hypocrisy
of the Anglo-Saxon. It may sound odd to speak of the morality of the French, if not of the
hypocrisy of the English; but this seeming paradox impresses me as a deep truth. I saw many
things in Paris which were immoral according to English standards, but the absence of hypocrisy,
the absence of the spirit to do the thing if it might only be done in secret, robbed these
very immoralities of the damning influence of the same evils in London. I have walked along
the terrace cafés of Paris and seen hundreds of men and women sipping their wine and beer,
without observing a sign of drunkenness. As they drank, they chatted and laughed and watched
the passing crowds; the drinking seemed to be a secondary thing. This I have witnessed, not
only in the cafés along the Grands Boulevards, but in the out-of-the-way places patronized
by the working classes. In London I have seen in the "pubs" men and women crowded in stuffy
little compartments, drinking seemingly only for the pleasure of swallowing as much as they
could hold. I have seen there women from eighteen to eighty, some in tatters, and some clutching
babes in their arms, drinking the heavy English ales and whiskies served to them by women.
In the whole scene, not one ray of brightness, not one flash of gaiety, only maudlin joviality
or grim despair. And I have thought, if some men and women will drink--and it is certain that
some will--is it not better that they do so under the open sky, in the fresh air, than huddled
together in some close, smoky room? There is a sort of frankness about the evils of Paris which
robs them of much of the seductiveness of things forbidden, and with that frankness goes a
certain cleanliness of thought belonging to things not hidden. London will do whatever Paris
does, provided exterior morals are not shocked. As a result, Paris has the appearance only
of being the more immoral city. The difference may be summed up in this: Paris practices its
sins as lightly as it does its religion, while London practices both very seriously.

I should not neglect to mention what impressed me most forcibly during my stay in London. It
was not St. Paul's nor the British Museum nor Westminster Abbey. It was nothing more or less
than the simple phrase "Thank you," or sometimes more elaborated, "Thank you very kindly, sir."
I was continually surprised by the varied uses to which it was put; and, strange to say, its
use as an expression of politeness seemed more limited than any other. One night I was in a
cheap music hall and accidentally bumped into a waiter who was carrying a tray-load of beer,
almost bringing him to several shillings' worth of grief. To my amazement he righted himself
and said: "Thank ye, sir," and left me wondering whether he meant that he thanked me for not
completely spilling his beer, or that he would thank me for keeping out of his way.

I also found cause to wonder upon what ground the English accuse Americans of corrupting the
language by introducing slang words. I think I heard more and more different kinds of slang
during my few weeks' stay in London than in my whole "tenderloin" life in New York. But I suppose
the English feel that the language is theirs, and that they may do with it as they please without
at the same time allowing that privilege to others.

My millionaire was not so long in growing tired of London as of Paris. After a stay of six
or eight weeks we went across into Holland. Amsterdam was a great surprise to me. I had always
thought of Venice as the city of canals; it had never entered my mind that I should find similar
conditions in a Dutch town. I don't suppose the comparison goes far beyond the fact that there
are canals in both cities--I have never seen Venice--but Amsterdam struck me as being extremely
picturesque. From Holland we went to Germany, where we spent five or six months, most of the
time in Berlin. I found Berlin more to my taste than London, and occasionally I had to admit
that in some things it was superior to Paris.

In Berlin I especially enjoyed the orchestral concerts, and I attended a large number of them.
I formed the acquaintance of a good many musicians, several of whom spoke of my playing in
high terms. It was in Berlin that my inspiration was renewed.

One night my millionaire entertained a party of men composed of artists, musicians, writers,
and, for aught I know, a count or two. They drank and smoked a great deal, talked art and music,
and discussed, it seemed to me, everything that ever entered man's mind. I could only follow
the general drift of what they were saying. When they discussed music, it was more interesting
to me; for then some fellow would run excitedly to the piano and give a demonstration of his
opinions, and another would follow quickly, doing the same. In this way, I learned that, regardless
of what his specialty might be, every man in the party was a musician. I was at the same time
impressed with the falsity of the general idea that Frenchmen are excitable and emotional,
and that Germans are calm and phlegmatic. Frenchmen are merely gay and never overwhelmed by
their emotions. When they talk loud and fast, it is merely talk, while Germans get worked up
and red in the face when sustaining an opinion, and in heated discussions are likely to allow
their emotions to sweep them off their feet.

My millionaire planned, in the midst of the discussion on music, to have me play the "new American
music" and astonish everybody present. The result was that I was more astonished than anyone
else. I went to the piano and played the most intricate ragtime piece I knew. Before there
was time for anybody to express an opinion on what I had done, a big bespectacled, bushy-headed
man rushed over, and, shoving me out of the chair, exclaimed: "Get up! Get up!" He seated himself
at the piano, and, taking the theme of my ragtime, played it through first in straight chords;
then varied and developed it through every known musical form. I sat amazed. I had been turning
classic music into ragtime, a comparatively easy task; and this man had taken ragtime and made
it classic. The thought came across me like a flash--It can be done, why can't I do it? From
that moment my mind was made up. I clearly saw the way of carrying out the ambition I had formed
when a boy.

I now lost interest in our trip. I thought: "Here I am a man, no longer a boy, and what am
I doing but wasting my time and abusing my talent? What use am I making of my gifts? What future
have I before me following my present course?" These thoughts made me feel remorseful and put
me in a fever to get to work, to begin to do something. Of course I know now that I was not
wasting time; that there was nothing I could have done at that age which would have benefited
me more than going to Europe as I did. The desire to begin work grew stronger each day. I could
think of nothing else. I made up my mind to go back into the very heart of the South, to live
among the people, and drink in my inspiration firsthand. I gloated over the immense amount
of material I had to work with, not only modern ragtime, but also the old slave songs--material
which no one had yet touched.

The more decided and anxious I became to return to the United States, the more I dreaded the
ordeal of breaking with my millionaire. Between this peculiar man and me there had grown a
very strong bond of affection, backed up by a debt which each owed to the other. He had taken
me from a terrible life in New York and, by giving me the opportunity of traveling and of coming
in contact with the people with whom he associated, had made me a polished man of the world.
On the other hand, I was his chief means of disposing of the thing which seemed to sum up all
in life that he dreaded--time. As I remember him now, I can see that time was what he was always
endeavoring to escape, to bridge over, to blot out; and it is not strange that some years later
he did escape it forever, by leaping into eternity.

For some weeks I waited for just the right moment in which to tell my patron of my decision.
Those weeks were a trying time to me. I felt that I was playing the part of a traitor to my
best friend. At length, one day he said to me: "Well, get ready for a long trip; we are going
to Egypt, and then to Japan." The temptation was for an instant almost overwhelming, but I
summoned determination enough to say: "I don't think I want to go." "What!" he exclaimed, "you
want to go back to your dear Paris? You still think that the only spot on earth? Wait until
you see Cairo and Tokyo, you may change your mind." "No," I stammered, "it is not because I
want to go back to Paris. I want to go back to the United States." He wished to know my reason,
and I told him, as best I could, my dreams, my ambition, and my decision. While I was talking,
he watched me with a curious, almost cynical, smile growing on his lips. When I had finished
he put his hand on my shoulder--this was the first physical expression of tender regard he
had ever shown me--and looking at me in a big-brotherly way, said: "My boy, you are by blood,
by appearance, by education, and by tastes a white man. Now, why do you want to throw your
life away amidst the poverty and ignorance, in the hopeless struggle, of the black people of
the United States? Then look at the terrible handicap you are placing on yourself by going
home and working as a Negro composer; you can never be able to get the hearing for your work
which it might deserve. I doubt that even a white musician of recognized ability could succeed
there by working on the theory that American music should be based on Negro themes. Music is
a universal art; anybody's music belongs to everybody; you can't limit it to race or country.
Now, if you want to become a composer, why not stay right here in Europe? I will put you under
the best teachers on the Continent. Then if you want to write music on Negro themes, why, go
ahead and do it."

We talked for some time on music and the race question. On the latter subject I had never before
heard him express any opinion. Between him and me no suggestion of racial differences had ever
come up. I found that he was a man entirely free from prejudice, but he recognized that prejudice
was a big stubborn entity which had to be taken into account. He went on to say: "This idea
you have of making a Negro out of yourself is nothing more than a sentiment; and you do not
realize the fearful import of what you intend to do. What kind of a Negro would you make now,
especially in the South? If you had remained there, or perhaps even in your club in New York,
you might have succeeded very well; but now you would be miserable. I can imagine no more dissatisfied
human being than an educated, cultured, and refined colored man in the United States. I have
given more study to the race question in the United States than you may suppose, and I sympathize
with the Negroes there; but what's the use? I can't right their wrongs, and neither can you;
they must do that themselves. They are unfortunate in having wrongs to right, and you would
be foolish to take their wrongs unnecessarily on your shoulders. Perhaps some day, through
study and observation, you will come to see that evil is a force, and, like the physical and
chemical forces, we cannot annihilate it; we may only change its form. We light upon one evil
and hit it with all the might of our civilization, but only succeed in scattering it into a
dozen other forms. We hit slavery through a great civil war. Did we destroy it? No, we only
changed it into hatred between sections of the country: in the South, into political corruption
and chicanery, the degradation of the blacks through peonage, unjust laws, unfair and cruel
treatment; and the degradation of the whites by their resorting to these practices, the paralyzation
of the public conscience, and the ever over-hanging dread of what the future may bring. Modern
civilization hit ignorance of the masses through the means of popular education. What has it
done but turn ignorance into anarchy, socialism, strikes, hatred between poor and rich, and
universal discontent? In like manner, modern philanthropy hit at suffering and disease through
asylums and hospitals; it prolongs the sufferers' lives, it is true, but is, at the same time,
sending down strains of insanity and weakness into future generations. My philosophy of life
is this: make yourself as happy as possible, and try to make those happy whose lives come in
touch with yours; but to attempt to right the wrongs and ease the sufferings of the world in
general is a waste of effort. You had just as well try to bail the Atlantic by pouring the
water into the Pacific."

This tremendous flow of serious talk from a man I was accustomed to see either gay or taciturn
so surprised and overwhelmed me that I could not frame a reply. He left me thinking over what
he had said. Whatever was the soundness of his logic or the moral tone of his philosophy, his
argument greatly impressed me. I could see, in spite of the absolute selfishness upon which
it was based, that there was reason and common sense in it. I began to analyze my own motives,
and found that they, too, were very largely mixed with selfishness. Was it more a desire to
help those I considered my people, or more a desire to distinguish myself, which was leading
me back to the United States? That is a question I have never definitely answered.

For several weeks longer I was in a troubled state of mind. Added to the fact that I was loath
to leave my good friend was the weight of the question he had aroused in my mind, whether I
was not making a fatal mistake. I suffered more than one sleepless night during that time.
Finally, I settled the question on purely selfish grounds, in accordance with my millionaire's
philosophy. I argued that music offered me a better future than anything else I had any knowledge
of, and, in opposition to my friend's opinion, that I should have greater chances of attracting
attention as a colored composer than as a white one. But I must own that I also felt stirred
by an unselfish desire to voice all the joys and sorrows, the hopes and ambitions, of the American
Negro, in classic musical form.

When my mind was fully made up, I told my friend. He asked me when I intended to start. I replied
that I would do so at once. He then asked me how much money I had. I told him that I had saved
several hundred dollars out of sums he had given me. He gave me a check for five hundred dollars,
told me to write to him in care of his Paris bankers if I ever needed his help, wished me good
luck, and bade me good-by. All this he did almost coldly; and I often wondered whether he was
in a hurry to get rid of what he considered a fool, or whether he was striving to hide deeper
feelings.

And so I separated from the man who was, all in all, the best friend I ever had, except my
mother, the man who exerted the greatest influence ever brought into my life, except that exerted
by my mother. My affection for him was so strong, my recollections of him are so distinct,
he was such a peculiar and striking character, that I could easily fill several chapters with
reminiscences of him; but for fear of tiring the reader I shall go on with my narration.

I decided to go to Liverpool and take ship for Boston. I still had an uneasy feeling about
returning to New York; and in a few days I found myself aboard ship headed for home.

X

Among the first of my fellow-passengers of whom I took any particular notice was a tall, broad-shouldered,
almost gigantic, colored man. His dark-brown face was clean-shaven; he was well-dressed and
bore a decidedly distinguished air. In fact, if he was not handsome, he at least compelled
admiration for his fine physical proportions. He attracted general attention as he strode the
deck in a sort of majestic loneliness. I became curious to know who he was and determined to
strike up an acquaintance with him at the first opportune moment. The chance came a day or
two later. He was sitting in the smoking-room, with a cigar, which had gone out, in his mouth,
reading a novel. I sat down beside him and, offering him a fresh cigar, said: "You don't mind
my telling you something unpleasant, do you?" He looked at me with a smile, accepted the proffered
cigar, and replied in a voice which comported perfectly with his size and appearance: "I think
my curiosity overcomes any objections I might have." "Well," I said, "have you noticed that
the man who sat at your right in the saloon during the first meal has not sat there since?"
He frowned slightly without answering my question. "Well," I continued, "he asked the steward
to remove him; and not only that, he attempted to persuade a number of the passengers to protest
against your presence in the dining-saloon." The big man at my side took a long draw from his
cigar, threw his head back, and slowly blew a great cloud of smoke toward the ceiling. Then
turning to me he said: "Do you know, I don't object to anyone's having prejudices so long as
those prejudices don't interfere with my personal liberty. Now, the man you are speaking of
had a perfect right to change his seat if I in any way interfered with his appetite or his
digestion. I should have no reason to complain if he removed to the farthest corner of the
saloon, or even if he got off the ship; but when his prejudice attempts to move me one foot,
one inch, out of the place where I am comfortably located, then I object." On the word "object"
he brought his great fist down on the table in front of us with such a crash that everyone
in the room turned to look. We both covered up the slight embarrassment with a laugh and strolled
out on the deck.

We walked the deck for an hour or more, discussing different phases of the Negro question.
In referring to the race I used the personal pronoun "we"; my companion made no comment about
it, nor evinced any surprise, except to raise his eyebrows slightly the first time he caught
the significance of the word. He was the broadest-minded colored man I have ever talked with
on the Negro question. He even went so far as to sympathize with and offer excuses for some
white Southern points of view. I asked him what were his main reasons for being so hopeful.
He replied: "In spite of all that is written, said, and done, this great, big, incontrovertible
fact stands out--the Negro is progressing, and that disproves all the arguments in the world
that he is incapable of progress. I was born in slavery, and at emancipation was set adrift
a ragged, penniless bit of humanity. I have seen the Negro in every grade, and I know what
I am talking about. Our detractors point to the increase of crime as evidence against us; certainly
we have progressed in crime as in other things; what less could be expected? And yet, in this
respect, we are far from the point which has been reached by the more highly civilized white
race. As we continue to progress, crime among us will gradually lose much of its brutal, vulgar,
I might say healthy, aspect, and become more delicate, refined, and subtle. Then it will be
less shocking and noticeable, although more dangerous to society." Then dropping his tone of
irony, he continued with some show of eloquence: "But, above all, when I am discouraged and
disheartened, I have this to fall back on: if there is a principle of right in the world, which
finally prevails, and I believe that there is; if there is a merciful but justice-loving God
in heaven, and I believe that there is, we shall win; for we have right on our side, while
those who oppose us can defend themselves by nothing in the moral law, nor even by anything
in the enlightened thought of the present age."

For several days, together with other topics, we discussed the race problem, not only of the
United States, but as it affected native Africans and Jews. Finally, before we reached Boston,
our conversation had grown familiar and personal. I had told him something of my past and much
about my intentions for the future. I learned that he was a physician, a graduate of Howard
University, Washington, and had done post-graduate work in Philadelphia; and this was his second
trip abroad to attend professional courses. He had practiced for some years in the city of
Washington, and though he did not say so, I gathered that his practice was a lucrative one.
Before we left the ship, he had made me promise that I would stop two or three days in Washington
before going on south.

We put up at a hotel in Boston for a couple of days and visited several of my new friend's
acquaintances; they were all people of education and culture and, apparently, of means. I could
not help being struck by the great difference between them and the same class of colored people
in the South. In speech and thought they were genuine Yankees. The difference was especially
noticeable in their speech. There was none of that heavy-tongued enunciation which characterizes
even the best-educated colored people of the South. It is remarkable, after all, what an adaptable
creature the Negro is. I have seen the black West Indian gentleman in London, and he is in
speech and manners a perfect Englishman. I have seen natives of Haiti and Martinique in Paris,
and they are more Frenchy than a Frenchman. I have no doubt that the Negro would make a good
Chinaman, with exception of the pigtail.

My stay in Washington, instead of being two or three days, was two or three weeks. This was
my first visit to the national capital, and I was, of course, interested in seeing the public
buildings and something of the working of the government; but most of my time I spent with
the doctor among his friends and acquaintances. The social phase of life among colored people
is more developed in Washington than in any other city in the country. This is on account of
the large number of individuals earning good salaries and having a reasonable amount of leisure
time to draw from. There are dozens of physicians and lawyers, scores of school teachers, and
hundreds of clerks in the departments. As to the colored department clerks, I think it fair
to say that in educational equipment they average above the white clerks of the same grade;
for, whereas a colored college graduate will seek such a job, the white university man goes
into one of the many higher vocations which are open to him.

In a previous chapter I spoke of social life among colored people; so there is no need to take
it up again here. But there is one thing I did not mention: among Negroes themselves there
is the peculiar inconsistency of a color question. Its existence is rarely admitted and hardly
ever mentioned; it may not be too strong a statement to say that the greater portion of the
race is unconscious of its influence; yet this influence, though silent, is constant. It is
evidenced most plainly in marriage selection; thus the black men generally marry women fairer
than themselves; while, on the other hand, the dark women of stronger mental endowment are
very often married to light-complexioned men; the effect is a tendency toward lighter complexions,
especially among the more active elements in the race. Some might claim that this is a tacit
admission of colored people among themselves of their own inferiority judged by the color line.
I do not think so. What I have termed an inconsistency is, after all, most natural; it is,
in fact, a tendency in accordance with what might be called an economic necessity. So far as
racial differences go, the United States puts a greater premium on color, or, better, lack
of color, than upon anything else in the world. To paraphrase, "Have a white skin, and all
things else may be added unto you." I have seen advertisements in newspapers for waiters, bell-boys,
or elevator men, which read: "Light-colored man wanted." It is this tremendous pressure which
the sentiment of the country exerts that is operating on the race. There is involved not only
the question of higher opportunity, but often the question of earning a livelihood; and so
I say it is not strange, but a natural tendency. Nor is it any more a sacrifice of self-respect
that a black man should give to his children every advantage he can which complexion of the
skin carries than that the new or vulgar rich should purchase for their children the advantages
which ancestry, aristocracy, and social position carry. I once heard a colored man sum it up
in these words: "It's no disgrace to be black, but it's often very inconvenient."

Washington shows the Negro not only at his best, but also at his worst. As I drove around with
the doctor, he commented rather harshly on those of the latter class which we saw. He remarked:
"You see those lazy, loafing, good-for-nothing darkies; they're not worth digging graves for;
yet they are the ones who create impressions of the race for the casual observer. It's because
they are always in evidence on the street corners, while the rest of us are hard at work, and
you know a dozen loafing darkies make a bigger crowd and a worse impression in this country
than fifty white men of the same class. But they ought not to represent the race. We are the
race, and the race ought to be judged by us, not by them. Every race and every nation should
be judged by the best it has been able to produce, not by the worst."

The recollection of my stay in Washington is a pleasure to me now. In company with the doctor
I visited Howard University, the public schools, the excellent colored hospital, with which
he was in some way connected, if I remember correctly, and many comfortable and even elegant
homes. It was with some reluctance that I continued my journey south. The doctor was very kind
in giving me letters to people in Richmond and Nashville when I told him that I intended to
stop in both of these cities. In Richmond a man who was then editing a very creditable colored
newspaper gave me a great deal of his time and made my stay there of three or four days very
pleasant. In Nashville I spent a whole day at Fisk University, the home of the "Jubilee Singers,"
and was more than repaid for my time. Among my letters of introduction was one to a very prosperous
physician. He drove me about the city and introduced me to a number of people. From Nashville
I went to Atlanta, where I stayed long enough to gratify an old desire to see Atlanta University
again. I then continued my journey to Macon.

During the trip from Nashville to Atlanta I went into the smoking-compartment of the car to
smoke a cigar. I was traveling in a Pullman, not because of an abundance of funds, but because
through my experience with my millionaire a certain amount of comfort and luxury had become
a necessity to me whenever it was obtainable. When I entered the car, I found only a couple
of men there; but in a half-hour there were half a dozen or more. From the general conversation
I learned that a fat Jewish-looking man was a cigar manufacturer, and was experimenting in
growing Havana tobacco in Florida; that a slender bespectacled young man was from Ohio and
a professor in some State institution in Alabama; that a white-mustached, well-dressed man
was an old Union soldier who had fought through the Civil War; and that a tall, raw-boned,
red-faced man, who seemed bent on leaving nobody in ignorance of the fact that he was from
Texas, was a cotton planter.

In the North men may ride together for hours in a "smoker" and unless they are acquainted with
each other never exchange a word; in the South men thrown together in such manner are friends
in fifteen minutes. There is always present a warm-hearted cordiality which will melt down
the most frigid reserve. It may be because Southerners are very much like Frenchmen in that
they must talk; and not only must they talk, but they must express their opinions.

The talk in the car was for a while miscellaneous--on the weather, crops, business prospects;
the old Union soldier had invested capital in Atlanta, and he predicted that that city would
soon be one of the greatest in the country. Finally the conversation drifted to politics; then,
as a natural sequence, turned upon the Negro question.

In the discussion of the race question the diplomacy of the Jew was something to be admired;
he had the faculty of agreeing with everybody without losing his allegiance to any side. He
knew that to sanction Negro oppression would be to sanction Jewish oppression and would expose
him to a shot along that line from the old soldier, who stood firmly on the ground of equal
rights and opportunity to all men; long traditions and business instincts told him when in
Rome to act as a Roman. Altogether his position was a delicate one, and I gave him credit for
the skill he displayed in maintaining it. The young professor was apologetic. He had had the
same views as the G.A.R. man; but a year in the South had opened his eyes, and he had to confess
that the problem could hardly be handled any better than it was being handled by the Southern
whites. To which the G.A.R. man responded somewhat rudely that he had spent ten times as many
years in the South as his young friend and that he could easily understand how holding a position
in a State institution in Alabama would bring about a change of views. The professor turned
very red and had very little more to say. The Texan was fierce, eloquent, and profane in his
argument, and, in a lower sense, there was a direct logic in what he said, which was convincing;
it was only by taking higher ground, by dealing in what Southerners call "theories," that he
could be combated. Occasionally some one of the several other men in the "smoker" would throw
in a remark to reinforce what he said, but he really didn't need any help; he was sufficient
in himself.

In the course of a short time the controversy narrowed itself down to an argument between the
old soldier and the Texan. The latter maintained hotly that the Civil War was a criminal mistake
on the part of the North and that the humiliation which the South suffered during Reconstruction
could never be forgotten. The Union man retorted just as hotly that the South was responsible
for the war and that the spirit of unforgetfulness on its part was the greatest cause of present
friction; that it seemed to be the one great aim of the South to convince the North that the
latter made a mistake in fighting to preserve the Union and liberate the slaves. "Can you imagine,"
he went on to say, "what would have been the condition of things eventually if there had been
no war, and the South had been allowed to follow its course? Instead of one great, prosperous
country with nothing before it but the conquests of peace, a score of petty republics, as in
Central and South America, wasting their energies in war with each other or in revolutions."

"Well," replied the Texan, "anything--no country at all--is better than having niggers over
you. But anyhow, the war was fought and the niggers were freed; for it's no use beating around
the bush, the niggers, and not the Union, was the cause of it; and now do you believe that
all the niggers on earth are worth the good white blood that was spilt? You freed the nigger
and you gave him the ballot, but you couldn't make a citizen out of him. He don't know what
he's voting for, and we buy 'em like so many hogs. You're giving 'em education, but that only
makes slick rascals out of 'em."

"Don't fancy for a moment," said the Northern man, "that you have any monopoly in buying ignorant
votes. The same thing is done on a larger scale in New York and Boston, and in Chicago and
San Francisco; and they are not black votes either. As to education's making the Negro worse,
you might just as well tell me that religion does the same thing. And, by the way, how many
educated colored men do you know personally?"

The Texan admitted that he knew only one, and added that he was in the penitentiary. "But,"
he said, "do you mean to claim, ballot or no ballot, education or no education, that niggers
are the equals of white men?"

"That's not the question," answered the other, "but if the Negro is so distinctly inferior,
it is a strange thing to me that it takes such tremendous effort on the part of the white man
to make him realize it, and to keep him in the same place into which inferior men naturally
fall. However, let us grant for sake of argument that the Negro is inferior in every respect
to the white man; that fact only increases our moral responsibility in regard to our actions
toward him. Inequalities of numbers, wealth, and power, even of intelligence and morals, should
make no difference in the essential rights of men."

"If he's inferior and weaker, and is shoved to the wall, that's his own look-out," said the
Texan. "That's the law of nature; and he's bound to go to the wall; for no race in the world
has ever been able to stand competition with the Anglo-Saxon. The Anglo-Saxon race has always
been and always will be the masters of the world, and the niggers in the South ain't going
to change all the records of history."

"My friend," said the old soldier slowly, "if you have studied history, will you tell me, as
confidentially between white men, what the Anglo-Saxon has ever done?"

The Texan was too much astonished by the question to venture any reply.

His opponent continued: "Can you name a single one of the great fundamental and original intellectual
achievements which have raised man in the scale of civilization that may be credited to the
Anglo-Saxon? The art of letters, of poetry, of music, of sculpture, of painting, of the drama,
of architecture; the science of mathematics, of astronomy, of philosophy, of logic, of physics,
of chemistry, the use of the metals, and the principles of mechanics, were all invented or
discovered by darker and what we now call inferior races and nations. We have carried many
of these to their highest point of perfection, but the foundation was laid by others. Do you
know the only original contribution to civilization we can claim is what we have done in steam
and electricity and in making implements of war more deadly? And there we worked largely on
principles which we did not discover. Why, we didn't even originate the religion we use. We
are a great race, the greatest in the world today, but we ought to remember that we are standing
on a pile of past races, and enjoy our position with a little less show of arrogance. We are
simply having our turn at the game, and we were a long time getting to it. After all, racial
supremacy is merely a matter of dates in history. The man here who belongs to what is, all
in all, the greatest race the world ever produced, is almost ashamed to own it. If the Anglo-Saxon
is the source of everything good and great in the human race from the beginning, why wasn't
the German forest the birthplace of civilization, rather than the valley of the Nile?"

The Texan was somewhat disconcerted, for the argument had passed a little beyond his limits,
but he swung it back to where he was sure of his ground by saying: "All that may be true, but
it hasn't got much to do with us and the niggers here in the South. We've got 'em here, and
we've got 'em to live with, and it's a question of white man or nigger, no middle ground. You
want us to treat niggers as equals. Do you want to see 'em sitting around in our parlors? Do
you want to see a mulatto South? To bring it right home to you, would you let your daughter
marry a nigger?"

"No, I wouldn't consent to my daughter's marrying a nigger, but that doesn't prevent my treating
a black man fairly. And I don't see what fair treatment has to do with niggers sitting around
in your parlors; they can't come there unless they're invited. Out of all the white men I know,
only a hundred or so have the privilege of sitting around in my parlor. As to the mulatto South,
if you Southerners have one boast that is stronger than another, it is your women; you put
them on a pinnacle of purity and virtue and bow down in a chivalric worship before them; yet
you talk and act as though, should you treat the Negro fairly and take the anti-inter-marriage
laws off your statute books, these same women would rush into the arms of black lovers and
husbands. It's a wonder to me that they don't rise up and resent the insult."

"Colonel," said the Texan, as he reached into his handbag and brought out a large flask of
whisky, "you might argue from now until hell freezes over, and you might convince me that you're
right, but you'll never convince me that I'm wrong. All you say sounds very good, but it's
got nothing to do with facts. You can say what men ought to be, but they ain't that; so there
you are. Down here in the South we're up against facts, and we're meeting 'em like facts. We
don't believe the nigger is or ever will be the equal of the white man, and we ain't going
to treat him as an equal; I'll be damned if we will. Have a drink." Everybody except the professor
partook of the generous Texan's flask, and the argument closed in a general laugh and good feeling.

I went back into the main part of the car with the conversation on my mind. Here I had before
me the bald, raw, naked aspects of the race question in the South; and, in consideration of
the step I was just taking, it was far from encouraging. The sentiments of the Texan--and he
expressed the sentiments of the South--fell upon me like a chill. I was sick at heart. Yet
I must confess that underneath it all I felt a certain sort of admiration for the man who could
not be swayed from what he held as his principles. Contrasted with him, the young Ohio professor
was indeed a pitiable character. And all along, in spite of myself, I have been compelled to
accord the same kind of admiration to the Southern white man for the manner in which he defends
not only his virtues, but his vices. He knows that, judged by a high standard, he is narrow
and prejudiced, that he is guilty of unfairness, oppression, and cruelty, but this he defends
as stoutly as he would his better qualities. This same spirit obtains in a great degree among
the blacks; they, too, defend their faults and failings. This they generally do whenever white
people are concerned. And yet among themselves they are their own most merciless critics. I
have never heard the race so terribly arraigned as I have by colored speakers to strictly colored
audiences. It is the spirit of the South to defend everything belonging to it. The North is
too cosmopolitan and tolerant for such a spirit. If you should say to an Easterner that Paris
is a gayer city than New York, he would be likely to agree with you, or at least to let you
have your own way; but to suggest to a South Carolinian that Boston is a nicer city to live
in than Charleston would be to stir his greatest depths of argument and eloquence.

But to-day, as I think over that smoking-car argument, I can see it in a different light. The
Texan's position does not render things so hopeless, for it indicates that the main difficulty
of the race question does not lie so much in the actual condition of the blacks as it does
in the mental attitude of the whites; and a mental attitude, especially one not based on truth,
can be changed more easily than actual conditions. That is to say, the burden of the question
is not that the whites are struggling to save ten million despondent and moribund people from
sinking into a hopeless slough of ignorance, poverty, and barbarity in their very midst, but
that they are unwilling to open certain doors of opportunity and to accord certain treatment
to ten million aspiring, education-and-property-acquiring people. In a word, the difficulty
of the problem is not so much due to the facts presented as to the hypothesis assumed for its
solution. In this it is similar to the problem of the solar system. By a complex, confusing,
and almost contradictory mathematical process, by the use of zigzags instead of straight lines,
the earth can be proved to be the center of things celestial; but by an operation so simple
that it can be comprehended by a schoolboy, its position can be verified among the other worlds
which revolve about the sun, and its movements harmonized with the laws of the universe. So,
when the white race assumes as a hypothesis that it is the main object of creation and that
all things else are merely subsidiary to its well-being, sophism, subterfuge, perversion of
conscience, arrogance, injustice, oppression, cruelty, sacrifice of human blood, all are required
to maintain the position, and its dealings with other races become indeed a problem, a problem
which, if based on a hypothesis of common humanity, could be solved by the simple rules of justice.

When I reached Macon, I decided to leave my trunk and all my surplus belongings, to pack my
bag, and strike out into the interior. This I did; and by train, by mule and ox-cart, I traveled
through many counties. This was my first real experience among rural colored people, and all
that I saw was interesting to me; but there was a great deal which does not require description
at my hands; for log cabins and plantations and dialect-speaking "darkies" are perhaps better
known in American literature than any other single picture of our national life. Indeed, they
form an ideal and exclusive literary concept of the American Negro to such an extent that it
is almost impossible to get the reading public to recognize him in any other setting; so I
shall endeavor to avoid giving the reader any already overworked and hackneyed descriptions.
This generally accepted literary ideal of the American Negro constitutes what is really an
obstacle in the way of the thoughtful and progressive element of the race. His character has
been established as a happy-go-lucky, laughing, shuffling, banjo-picking being, and the reading
public has not yet been prevailed upon to take him seriously. His efforts to elevate himself
socially are looked upon as a sort of absurd caricature of "white civilization." A novel dealing
with colored people who lived in respectable homes and amidst a fair degree of culture and
who naturally acted "just like white folks" would be taken in a comic-opera sense. In this
respect the Negro is much in the position of a great comedian who gives up the lighter roles
to play tragedy. No matter how well he may portray the deeper passions, the public is loath
to give him up in his old character; they even conspire to make him a failure in serious work,
in order to force him back into comedy. In the same respect, the public is not too much to
be blamed, for great comedians are far more scarce than mediocre tragedians; every amateur
actor is a tragedian. However, this very fact constitutes the opportunity of the future Negro
novelist and poet to give the country something new and unknown, in depicting the life, the
ambitions, the struggles, and the passions of those of their race who are striving to break
the narrow limits of traditions. A beginning has already been made in that remarkable book
by Dr. Du Bois, The Souls of Black Folk. 

A quick explanation was conducted, which showed that all documents sent to North Carolina in connection
with a Mary Smith, but the woman whose freedom was obtained, was another Mary Smith.
Governor Everett had a laugh when the father Snowden told the happy result of his letter to
the Governor of North Carolina.
The moral of this story is that a normal name, common, sometimes is more useful to its owner,
a brighter.
NOTE .-- I have endeavored to give the facts of the story of Mary Smith's with exact precision,
writing from memory alone, without help from anything written. It's the best I can be wrong
in any circumstance is irrelevant.
Freedom - Freedom.
Liberty and freedom are synonymous. Freedom is an essence of Liberty, an accident. Freedom is born with
a man, the freedom can be attributed to him. Freedom is progressive, freedom is limited. Freedom
is the gift of God, freedom, the creature of society. Freedom can be removed from a man but for
some freedom soul alight, the course of that soul is from then onwards and upwards, society, customs,
laws, armies, are like in their clutches Wythes giants, if they do, tools to work their will, if
assent. Human kind welcome the birth of a free soul with reverence and cheers of joy at the advent
of a new branch of the Divine Whole, of which this is but one part.

NEW YORK, November 22nd. 
The monologue The death
of the victim of the tragedy Wilkesbarre. 
He approached from behind
by Deputy Marshal and his assistants Wyncoop, tore down with a sledgehammer
and partially shackled. The fugitive, who had hoped without suspecting
anything about them at breakfast at the Hotel Phenix, was a tall,
noble-looking, intelligent, remarkably, and a nearly white mulatto,
after a desperate struggle and hardship severe, detached from their
five assailants, and the loss of all but a remnant of his shirt, ran
out of the house and plunged into the water, exclaiming, "I'll drown
rather than be taken alive."

And yet in this respect how perplexing is Southern character; for, in opposition to the above,
it may be said that the claim of the Southern whites that they love the Negro better than the
Northern whites do is in a manner true. Northern white people love the Negro in a sort of abstract
way, as a race; through a sense of justice, charity, and philanthropy, they will liberally
assist in his elevation. A number of them have heroically spent their lives in this effort
(and just here I wish to say that when the colored people reach the monument-building stage,
they should not forget the men and women who went South after the war and founded schools for
them). Yet, generally speaking, they have no particular liking for individuals of the race.
Southern white people despise the Negro as a race, and will do nothing to aid in his elevation
as such; but for certain individuals they have a strong affection, and are helpful to them
in many ways. With these individual members of the race they live on terms of the greatest
intimacy; they entrust to them their children, their family treasures, and their family secrets;
in trouble they often go to them for comfort and counsel; in sickness they often rely upon
their care. This affectionate relation between the Southern whites and those blacks who come
into close touch with them has not been overdrawn even in fiction.

This perplexity of Southern character extends even to the intermixture of the races. That is
spoken of as though it were dreaded worse than smallpox, leprosy, or the plague. Yet, when
I was in Jacksonville, I knew several prominent families there with large colored branches,
which went by the same name and were known and acknowledged as blood relatives. And what is
more, there seemed to exist between these black brothers and sisters and uncles and aunts a
decidedly friendly feeling.

I said above that Southern whites would do nothing for the Negro as a race. I know the South
claims that it has spent millions for the education of the blacks, and that it has of its own
free will shouldered this awful burden. It seems to be forgetful of the fact that these millions
have been taken from the public tax funds for education, and that the law of political economy
which recognizes the land owner as the one who really pays the taxes is not tenable. Any added
scheme would bang been unworkable. Let a Gathering be titled to-morrow--let them fit cardinal
present; nay, bill chiliad nowadays; they present mortal the same difficulties to connexion;
the identical clashing interests to settle. Let the millions of producing and consuming
Negroes be taken out of the South, and it would be quickly seen how much less of public funds
there would be to appropriate for education or any other purpose.

In thus traveling about through the country I was sometimes amused on arriving at some little
railroad-station town to be taken for and treated as a white man, and six hours later, when
it was learned that I was stopping at the house of the colored preacher or school teacher,
to note the attitude of the whole town change. At times this led even to embarrassment. Yet
it cannot be so embarrassing for a colored man to be taken for white as for a white man to
be taken for colored; and I have heard of several cases of the latter kind.

All this while I was gathering material for work, jotting down in my note-book themes and melodies,
and trying to catch the spirit of the Negro in his relatively primitive state. I began to feel
the necessity of hurrying so that I might get back to some city like Nashville to begin my
compositions and at the same time earn at least a living by teaching and performing before
my funds gave out. At the last settlement in which I stopped I found a mine of material. This
was due to the fact that "big meeting" was in progress. "Big meeting" is an institution something
like camp-meeting, the difference being that it is held in a permanent church, and not in a
temporary structure. All the churches of some one denomination--of course, either Methodist
or Baptist--in a county, or, perhaps, in several adjoining counties, are closed, and the congregations
unite at some centrally located church for a series of meetings lasting a week. It is really
a social as well as a religious function. The people come in great numbers, making the trip,
according to their financial status, in buggies drawn by sleek, fleet-footed mules, in ox-carts,
or on foot. It was amusing to see some of the latter class trudging down the hot and dusty
road, with their shoes, which were brand-new, strung across their shoulders. When they got
near the church, they sat on the side of the road and, with many grimaces, tenderly packed
their feet into those instruments of torture. This furnished, indeed, a trying test of their
religion. The famous preachers come from near and far and take turns in warning sinners of
the day of wrath. Food, in the form of those two Southern luxuries, fried chicken and roast
pork, is plentiful, and no one need go hungry. On the opening Sunday the women are immaculate
in starched stiff white dresses adorned with ribbons, either red or blue. Even a great many
of the men wear streamers of vari-colored ribbons in the buttonholes of their coats. A few
of them carefully cultivate a forelock of hair by wrapping it in twine, and on such festive
occasions decorate it with a narrow ribbon streamer. Big meetings afford a fine opportunity
to the younger people to meet each other dressed in their Sunday clothes, and much rustic courting,
which is as enjoyable as any other kind, is indulged in.

This big meeting which I was lucky enough to catch was particularly well attended; the extra
large attendance was due principally to two attractions, a man by the name of John Brown, who
was renowned as the most powerful preacher for miles around; and a wonderful leader of singing,
who was known as "Singing Johnson." These two men were a study and a revelation to me. They
caused me to reflect upon how great an influence their types have been in the development of
the Negro in America. With utter astonishment, Lucky answered "Santa Anal? The last I have heard
about him he was in Havana fighting cocks. I did read an obituary for him about half a year ago
or so, but I never really believed he was dead."


John Brown was a jet-black man of medium size, with a strikingly intelligent head and face,
and a voice like an organ peal. Feb. 21 - Syria is getting more and more upset with Germany, and additional
reserves are called out.
Feb. 27 - A Cabinet Counsil in Constantinople decides to move the government seat to Broussa
in Asia Minor.
United States:
Feb. 2 - A German named Werner Horn attempts but fails to bomb the
Canadian Pacific Railroad Bridge over the St. Croix River between
Vanceboro, Maine, in the United States and New Brunswick in Canada.
The bridge sustains only minor damage. Maine police arrest him, and
Canada asks that he be extradited.
He knew all the arts and tricks of oratory, the modulation of the voice to almost a whisper,
the pause for effect, the rise through light, rapid-fire sentences to the terrific, thundering
outburst of an electrifying climax. In addition, he had the intuition of a born theatrical
manager. Night after night this man held me fascinated. He convinced me that, after all, eloquence
consists more in the manner of saying than in what is said. Let us scatter the seeds to the
winds of heaven having found them. whatever happens it will be able
to germinate, since there is no lack of space in the wide universe
for souls to find a good grounding place, if they are let free.

We should not enslave ourselves even by the people we admire the most. To be free is the best
homage that can be paid by us to great men like Tolstoy, as he was free.

TO MAXIM GORKI
A lecture was delivered by A. V. Lunacharski on the life and works of Maxim Gorki at Geneva,
in January, 1917 and a tribute as follows to Gorki was read before the lecture.
In the rue de la Sorbonne, in Paris, Charles Peguy, myself and a few others used to meet in a little
ground floor shop before fifteen years. "Cahiers de la Quinzaine,â had been started just
then. We did not have a properly furnished editorial office, but it was neat and clean, with books
lining the walls. The wall was decorated only by a single photograph, of Tolstoy and Gorki
standing side by side in the garden at Yasnaya Polyana. I did not know how was it possible
for Peguy to get hold of it. but he gave us all a copy which we had on our desks the picture
of these two distant comrades. A part of Jean Christophe was written under their eyes. The veteran
apostle has gone on the eve of the European disaster which was already predicted by him in which
his voice has been so greatly needed. The other, Maxim Gorki, is at his appointed place, and
his free speech help to cheer us up for Tolstoy's silence.
Gorki did not succumb to the vertigo of events. Maxim Gorki was one of the rare exceptions, one
of those whose reason and whose love of humanity remained unshaken, amid the distressing mass
of writers, artists and thinkers who laid down their role as guides and defenders of the masses
to make the masses come to them. He spoke on behalf of the mistreated, suppressed and enslaved
masses. He has never hesitated to stay in the company of the unfortunate, of the humble, of the
victims, of the outcasts of the society.

Even after becoming famous he returns to them with the powerful light of his knowledge into the
darkness where the wickedness and injustice in the society are kept in hiding. Suffering was
not something new to his generous suffering; his vision is not away from the sufferings of the
people.
Haud ignara mali, miseris succurrere disco....  Consequently, in these days of trial in these days
when freedom of the spirit is everywhere oppressed, we must cry aloud our homage to Maxim Gorki.
We extend our hands to him across the battlefields, across the trenches,
across a bleeding Europe. .

Therefore, in face of the hatred which rages among the nations, we must affirm the union
of New Europe. To the fighting "Holy Alliances" of the governments, we counterpose the brotherhood
of the free spirits of the world!
January 30, 1917.  "demain," Geneva, June, 1917.  X  TWO LETTERS FROM MAXIM GORKI
PETROGRAD, end of December, 1916.
MY DEAR AND VALUED COMRADE ROMAIN ROLLAND,
Can you write a biography of Beethoven, which may be suitable for children? I am also writing to H.G.
Wells, to write on the lives of Addison; Fridtjof Nansen will do the life of Christopher Columbus;
the Hebrew poet Bialik will write the life of Moses. Like this with the help of leading authors,
I am hoping to produce a number of books for children, with biographies of the leaders who were
role models to mankind. I will be issuing the whole series after edition.
Young people these days have to be cared for with much attention more than anything else. As
grown-ups we are not leaving a good inheritance to our children and
are bequeathing to them as sad life.

Civilization is getting decayed because of the foolish war of our
moral weakness.

  We have to remind our children that
  men had been much stronger than now and were not weak and bad like us. In all
  the nations all through the world there had
  been great men of fine spirits who lived in all ages.
  Congregation. Or do you think he slept?

(No response.) I think his dad probably asleep half the time he should be working?
Barbara. Probly. What's in your bag?

Julia.

I expect he chair stands in the sea is just a weeny bit too comfortable
for real work.

  
  Barbara. I eated up all choc'lates
  you did get me.

Julia.

  Maybe I'll find something more now.

Do you think Father writes in his sleep?
Barbara. Yes, I Fink he.
Julia. Listen, Suzie. I expect he just dreams really works. Not you, Babs?
At this point I thought it desirable for the sake of preserving remnants
of my parental authority, to come to tea.

Julia Barbara was teaching a package of chocolate, and welcomed me with a spring survey to determine
if I was busy writing. I answered yes, with an appetite.
"You should hear what your daughter has been said about you," said Julia.
"Oh, and do not tell Barbara?" I asked.
"She says that when father is in the stuffy little room that it usually write in my sleep It
really takes notice of the most amazing things. And how it expresses
itself is quite strange. " 
"So says Barbara write in my sleep?"
"Yes, you heard it right, Suzie? Oh, and I tell you that the other
day during the heavy storm, she said that angels and demons must be
having a great battle and that it angels should soon be going over
the top? " 
"Come here, Barbara," I said.

"Singing Johnson" was an ideal leader, and his services were in great demand. He spent his
time going about the country from one church to another. It has been said that the Mendelian formula
has limited applicability as it applies to human heredity. This might potentially be true
depending on the grammatical tense in which the statment is made. Certainly, it might also be
true heredity in mankind is accurately portrayed by this law. The resulting paradox is quickly
rendered. The Only people whose history in heredity pursues this formula are the unit characters.
An intricate trait is not passed down as a whole, rather, it's principle components act in
heredity as seperate units. It is common knowledge that we are somewhat uninformed regarding this stage
in human development.

Our ignorance concerning this subject is due to the relative modernity of the topic--we haven't
had time to research the issue in-depth. We are not able to say with certainity that a complex trait
ir or is not inherited bestowed by some mode of Mendel's law when we simply don't comprehend
the nature of units of which it is comprised? We can't make absolute statements regarding Mendellian
inheritence of such a trait until it is broken down into units. We know enough about human
characteristics to know that a large number of them are known to be heritable according to the formula.
However, enough ambiguity exists that some traits don't follow this particular law. This makes
it so we can't necessarily assume Mendel's laws to be applied to human heredity for the next couple
of years.
What shall we say about the vast majority of human characteristics? We have seen that on the
novelty board we talk on, with certainity the distribution of all peas, though we dwell within
the realmn of probability as it apples to the history of a single
pea.

Mendel's law concerns inheritence at the singular level. When we can't use the formula, we
stil allow for the potential of speaking about human heredity as single unit. The statistical method
focuses on the group rather than the personal level. Ignorence then causes us to need to procure
a better understanding of how we apply statistics in this case.

This technique is similar to the one used by statisticians when measuring the relativity of any two series
of alternate phenomena. If two quantities are so alike that changes in one are accompanied in
a same fashion by variations in the other, the two quantities are said to be interrelated. For examplee,
the temperature and the rate of growth of sprouting beans are relative in such a way that gain
in the former is accompanied in a normal way by gain in the less recent--or the width and height
of the head, or the sum ability and the length of the femur similarly vary together so that they
are said to be interrelated to a certain extent that can be measured. This interrelation can
result from the fact that one state is a cause, either direct or indirect, of the other. Potentially
though, there may be no causal relation between the two phenomena,
both resulting more or less independently typical antecedent condition
or cause. Only at the last moment
the soldier finds his courace, and Macbeth, driven to bay by fate, finds the energy of dispair
to fight fiercely.
Rossi's Lear, on the other hand, does not need to be criticised. Words fail when the heartstrings
are thrilled to trembling and to tears. The pathos of Lear's recognition of Cordelia was undescribable.
He stares for a long time at her face, then he is enlightened by reason and recognition. Finally
he sinks on his knees and implies his daughter to forgive him. He was tremendously in earnest; I might say, too much so. Neither he
ever had nor probably neither will he ever have it. He does not have any requirements or needs
for himself. His only weak point id his daughter who is a beautiful young lady.
He never believed the court of men and hence for his daughterâs education he sent her to a convent
place which is quite far off from Vienna. Now she lives there with a reputed family. She is afraid
of being identified by the court men. This is the reason she never comes to see her father
neither she fortress to inquire about her father.
The girl has now developed some liking for a young doctor and they want to get married. But the
doctor has no established practice and she also does not have any money. Her father has spent all his earnings
for her education and saved nothing for her dowry.â
â Does he intend to beg the Queen for the dower?â 
â He hates
to receive any gift or requesting any favor from the Queen.

He will despise such an idea. Even if the daughter dies of grief, he would not get engaged in
any such act for this gold which is against his principles. If we want to reward him, first
we have to win his confidenceâ
The princess wailed â We can definitely win his heart, if he has any, by telling him that
Trenck had bee suffering and is still suffering. The amount of pain and misery that has been
mounded over the poor girl will no doubt affect anyoneâs head and heart both. Once we convince
him, we will generously pay a dower to the daughter. By Godâs grace I am quite wealthy now to keep
my promises. Yesterday I received both my pension as the abbess and my wages as a princess. I have
some wealth now and will be adding some more to it. Is four thousand louis d'or enough to win
Savoyard's heart?â
â This would have been great for any one, but for an honest person like him, it not so.â

â But is it sufficient?â
â Yes, it isâ  â We must find some sly messenger to be sent to him; a person who is committed
to his cause by his head body and soul. Now the question is how and where do we find that person?â

General Riedt laughed. He said â I was under the impression that your royal highness have already
spotted that personâ
The princess was astonished and looked at him. She howled â It is the jeweler. He is the man
who got me the cup. The way he referred me to you was really intelligent and tactful.â 
â
I believe you wanted him to go back tomorrow early morning, isânt it?â
â How come you are aware of that? Are you familiar to him?
General Riedt smiled and bowed âIt was me who took the risk of
sending him to your highness.â 
 â Oh! Now the things are getting
clear to me.

I must admit that the jeweler is as great a negotiator as you are a diplomat. Is it you who
sent me the cup which I just referred to?â
âGovernor of Magdeburg, the Landgrave of Hesse had given it to me.
It was of no use to me hence I endeavored to send it to youâ 
âThank
you general for being so tactful and intelligent in sending this.
Now, we should not reveal this to my brother otherwise he will go
against usâ Irais told Minora that the Precious Stocking: or Thoughts on the erthics of Petticoats,Irais
suggested Minora to put these wordings as the title for the next book which is going to be written
by her on Germany. Minora replied that she never knows that,Irais
was too early on that matter. I had come to know the type well, blond,
tall, and lean, with ragged mustache and beard, and glittering gray eyes. What else can tell the author?

holidays and that the ladies and children can participate with refreshment and joy. Last year
I tried a beer that was old, bitter and strong, and almost no one could drink. This year we
sent around a touch softer, and pleasing to the customer: if the critics (who like strong beer, rogues!)
Turn their noses. For heaven's sake, Mr. Smith served, the drink to the gentle people. Mrs. Pray,
dear, another glass, it's Christmas time, you will not hurt.

It is not intended to maintain long, this type of beverage. (Come on, foam up, Mr. Editor,
and move quickly around!) And as for the professional gentlemen, we have to get a species stronger
for them one day.
Knight of The Times (a gentleman's very difficult, please) is the strongest and highest of all and
made it more expensive terrible drinks on offer than any other critic. It is no use to circumvent
this statement! when a husband has abused Times, I can not hide, more than I could hide the knowledge
that had been sent to prison for Mr. Henry, or flogged in public in Pall Mall you see in the
eyes of your friends when they meet you. They know it. They laughed about it for a man. They
whisper about him at the club, and look beyond the paper on you. My neighbor came to me this
morning and looked at his face that he had the full story pat. "Hm!" says: "Well, I've heard
about it, and the truth is that they talked about you at dinner the night before, and states that
the Times had - ahem - 'came in you."
"My good ---- MI - M ---- and confirm if it is necessary statement to make here -" Here's the
Times article, dated 4th January as saying this and that and here is a letter from the editor, also
dated 4th January which reads: -
"MY DEAR Sir - Following today sold the last copy of the first edition (x thousand) of" Kickleburys
abroad, and that orders for more if we had better proceed with a second edition? And let me lock
you ordered, "& c. & C.?
Singular coincidence!

And if all the authors who were abused by one critic as there was
a similar note from a publisher, my God! the ease with which we take
the censorship of criticism! 
"Yes, yes," says "it's fine for an
author to affect to be indifferent to the criticism of the Times.
Use it as a kid is knocked up in school and not screaming, but not
arrogance, and boasting as if you like. " The Exhibition has surplanted more common
places of amusement, such as the theater, all of which remain in business, though operating at
a loss. Visitors spend very little and are noted by the shopkeepers to be unexciting. There is considerable
worry and stress that the price of admission may soon drop to a shilling
and measures have been taken to prevent such a calamity.

However, most of this fear remains unfounded and kept in exaggeration.
 According to an enthusiastic teacher, Lorenzo described
in dtail the Platonic philosohpy in his writings and mentioned his belief that without Plato
it would be hard to be a good citizen or even Christian.
 My heart turned bitter within me. The enemy approached the Greeks from the right. The Greeks
were primed for battle and when the enemy was within six or seven hundred yards, the Greeks could
no longer hold back.

Singing their paean and starting at a pace they went forward into battle; in no time they broke
into a run toward their enemies and combat. Fatherland! - How the cry of
the wild animals! The blood dripping from every mouth greedy, Blood brothers, each displaced from
their home for wild wolves, hungry in the South.
CHORUS - When subjects weapon deep in our beagle, & c.
That rave! the guns are ready, let them howl! our swords are interested and the nerve of the
hunter is stable on the track of wolf that is seen.
CHORUS - When subjects weapon deep in our beagle, & c.
Yes, the error floors o'er the border, but the earth is filled with their dead, until we in the
frantic chaos dark home hungry again.
THE POETRY OF NATURE
Among the many wonderful myths of antiquity, I know no more directly useful to people and the
character of the great struggle between land and Hercules Antaeus born.
The promise of a high proportion of raw power, is strangled Antaeus, but falling and touching the ground,
revive.

The man held by the irresistible force of fact may be false, shallow and weak: his art can
be reduced to mere imitation, that his poetry was moaning and seizures, but allowed even to use
nature - to the all-appreciated Mother Beautiful Earth - and all his works and songs to be like
the seas, rivers, green leaves, and the music of the birds.
We have long needed touch of fresh earth and holy. Too long has our love for the image and the
poem, and all that glorious impulse to create beauty in achieving fickle as the wind on the
basis of discordant and distorted fantasies tradition. The symbolism in art, now means that only
a child arbitrary and replacement of an object or the whim of a second. The most successful
poetic parable is often so thoroughly conventional, and therefore
as perishable as the delay. In short, we are not at a time when there
is a poem of the same for everyone, and when the artist and the poet
is really great and honest, and his works are regarded as the best
that man can do. The few who understand this in its full importance
of the towers just sobbing in the dark night, and groan, "Great Pan
is dead! ' 
But he is not dead, or asleep. The still new in the
early hours of that terrible ending. The Augusta was a screw
steamer with ship's rigging; Captain Weikhmann was her commander in the Franco-German war of 1870.
Together, in the war, they fought many battles and captured many ships.
January 4, 1871, the French brig St. Marc was sailing from Dunkirken
to Bordeaux to bring supplies to French troops when the Augusta captured
the vessel.

Additionally, the French transport steamer Max was taken over and destroyed. The French eventually
finally forced her to retreat to the spanish port of Vigo.

IMPROVEMENT IN METAL WHEELS.
In the Inventions Exhibitions may be seen a good form of metal wheel, the invention of Mr.
H.J. Barrett, of Hull, Eng., and which we illustrate.

These wheels are made in two classes, A and B.  Fig. 1 shows a perspective
view, Fig. 2 illustrates a transverse section, while Fig. 3 depicts
a longitudinal section of the boss.

"A" wheels were created for use on rough and uneven roads, making them stronger than those of
B design. The wheels are made with mild steel spokes, which are fastened by metal straps in the
recesses cut in the annular flanges on the boss. These spokes can be replaced by anyone within
a very short period of time.
Since the spokes are twisted they giver more power to the wheels and allow them to resist side
strains which helps to pull them out of holes or deep ruts. The bosses and straps are made of malleable
iron, in which the metal bushes are fastened with a key with a washer screwed up on the front
end. these bosses are also equipped with steel oil caps to the end of the bushes, which are
provided with a small set screw. The set screw also forms a fulcrum for a key, so that the cap
can be taken off or put on when required, as well as a means of preventing
the cap being lost by shaking loose on rough roads.The way it is designed,
the cap doesn't need to be taken off to lubricate the wheel, you just
simply take off the screw set and pour oil through the hole into the
cap.

In hot and dry climates, wood wheels constantly loosen and shrink which is a reoccurring expense.
Since the wheel has a metal rim this difficulty can be easily avoided
as the tires only need to be removed when they have been worn out,
not because they have warped in the elements.

The wheels of class B are the same design as A but they have metal
encasings to help protect the wheel from the elements and extend their
life expectancy.

 Nuniz reflects the basic feeling when he wrote of the Khan's rescue
of the Adil Shah, after his being defeated in 1520 A.D. at Raichur,as being accomplished (by
delicately pleasing) for his own means; and as he tells with a complete string of lies how, Asada manipulated
the execution of Salabat Khan by Krishna Raya.
The Portuguese at the time of this reign were working to set themselves
up at different locations on the coast, and many forts were constructed
by them there to protect their trades.

They had remained at nonstop war with the Samuri of Calicut as well as other Vijayanagar feudatories;
however they were allies with Raya himself and they created a peace treaty in 1540 with the Ahmadnagar
and Bijapur sovereigns and also with the Samuri.
 The King must have been satisfied, for besides a payment
of 5000 marks, I received in a couple of days through Wedel a diamond pin and a wonderful
gold watch and chain with the incription of the Grand Ducal arms of Mecklenburg-Schwerein
"For services rendered faithfully to my house."
Chapter VI. The Intrigue at Monte Carlo
Meahwhile, in Berlin from a mission to Vienna, my letters delivered,
once more comfortably residing in my quarters, on the Mittelstrasse,
I was anticipating an evening at the Pavilion Mascotte. I was sure that unknown, without friends or prestige, it would
be useless to try to establish myself as a teacher of music; so I gave that means of earning
a livelihood scarcely any consideration. However you are to be channeled in your scenario."

"Yes. But also I'm shocking desolate. I've unfailingly been accustomed to having Lyddy to talk
over things with, and I miss her a sight. Then again I don't know anyone that has her routes something
greater than you have.

You are a great bargain quite an impressive fabricated lady, and you hold the same hitch to
your shoulders when you stroll. You've got something the same look to your eyes, too; I acknowledged
it final Sunday in gathering-time," kept on the widower, uneasily.

"I do empathize with you. A man apart from everyone else is in a terrible scenario," answered Miss
Tame. "I'm confident I'd do any thing in my capacity to help you."

"Well, marry with me then. That is what I need. We might be certified pleasing as one unit.
I'll strive for the license this moment, and we'll be married almost immediately," given back
where its due suitor. "You head over up to Elder Crane's, and I'll meet you there whenever
I am able to bring around."

Then he hastened distant, "without giving me an opportunity to state 'no,'" expressed "she that
was" Persis Tame, a while later. "So I had to marry with him, as you may declare. Be that as it
may I've never viewed create to lament it, I've got a top notch of a drone, and Captain Ben constructs
a top notch of a spouse. And then no hain't he, I trust, found create to lament it," she united,
with a touch of wifely pride; "however I do anticipate he could have had his pick near every
last trace of the single ladies at the Point; but out of all of them he preferred me."--The
Atlantic Monthly, March, 1870.

STREET SCENES IN WASHINGTON.

The mules were my particular pleasure; and a hour's concentrate on of a predictable succession
of them acquainted me with a considerable lot of their attributes; for six of these odd small
monsters drew each armed force wagon, and go bouncing like frogs through the stream of mud that
tenderly moved in the lane. The flirty donkey had humble feet, a fantastically trimmed tassel
of a tail, livened-up ears, and appeared much given to small tosses
of the head, influenced skips and dances; and, depending on if he
wore the ringers, or were bedizened with a spot of luxury, put on
as numerous show as any looker. The ethical donkey was a stout, hardworking
animal, unfailingly tugging with all his may; regularly pulling endlessly
when the rest had quit, working under the reliable daydream that sustenance
for the whole armed force hinged on his private efforts. I regarded
this style of donkey; and, had I controlled a delicious cabbage, could
have pressed it upon him, with a debt of gratitude is in order regarding
his incredible sample. The dramatic donkey was an exaggerated quadruped,
inclined to startling humankind by unpredictable jumps, and wild plunges,
much shaking of his hardheaded take, and lashing off of his vicious
heels; sometimes falling level, and evidently biting the dust a la
Forrest; a heave--a squirm--a failure, et cetera, till the lane was
overall obstructed up, the drivers all swearing such as evil presences
in disagreeable caps, and the boss character's dissemination firmly
revived by each mixture of kick, sleeve, yank, and pull. In a report dated Paris, August 13 1703, it was declared that after careful examination,
no defect that could hinder generation could be found. The declaration was made by the physicians
Bourges and Thuillier as well as the surgeons, Tranchet and Meri.
 The Directors were hoping that more than 30 devoted evangelists (who were competent
by the way), would go on this expedition. After a while, English missionaries would come;
immediately 3 of the most devoted volunteered for this work. The
man chosen as chairman of the Athletic Department was Mr. Walter Camp. His title was General
Commissioner of Athletics for the U.S. Navy. At Yale for thirty years, he had been the driving force,
strategist, advisor, and organizer of athletics at that institution.
Mr. Camp took up his duties in the midsummer of 1917, only three months after the U.S. had
declared war. The Navy's plan was to station one hundred thousand men in each naval district
before the end of the year. This quota was quickly being met, and Mr. Camp was called upon to organize
recreational activities and sports at these stations. He was able to accomplish these tasks relying
on his experience. flexibility, and aptitude.
The navy recruits found themselves in a new and confusing environment.

Coming from varied backgrounds, wealthy, working class, college educated and factory workers
alike found themselves stationed in facilities that were incomplete and unfamiliar. Although
they were restless and uncomfortable, they gamely and patiently reconciled to these conditions.

Many of these young and patriotic Americans, suffering from homesickness also had to deal with the absence
of entertainment, the simple comforts of home and lack of recreational sports. The Navy Commission's
work and especially the contributions of Mr. Camp in the areas of
physical training and mental stimulation were vital and timely under
these conditions. They are all in agreement.
(46) Either the ministers left at home will or will not be ciphers. If they are, cabinet government,
also known as constitutional government, will take a hard knock. 

The tree starts to rot from the inside, and from the sap in particular. The decayed part can constitute
between 35% and 55% of the total volume of the tree once it has been cut down. It is made up
of different ingredients including a great deal of water some albuminous matter, starch, sugar
and resin, etc. Intuition proved as valuable as sight. He seemed to always
properly determine the victim's intention. Once he had the trail, he was no easier to lose than
a bloodhound. Yet he did not constantly follow the Indian's footsteps.
 "No potatoes? is the sky falling?" She asked. "You have been eating
mashed potatoes with cream and a little beetroot with meat for lunch for years."
"No, we can't eat potatoes anymore. Didn't you hear?"
"I heard something about it, but can't we eat those we already have?"
"No. We have to give them away. Remember? Just cold mutton and salad.
No toast. No toast anymore." vicious
drastics are incorrect, they do not do fine; you cannot go on generous physic every day, this
will teaze the guts and not sedate them, The treat is to do again
the enthusiasm of progressive deed.

People in common will not discover not in that what may be an sufficient enthusiasm one day,
may not be an plenty happiness on one additional day. As to these possessions, they are basically
managed, and you should concentrate to them. Every individual sophisticated in living knows
this, and attends to it.
 That same writer reports two events within a single sentence.
The same statements support each truth, although one seems to go against the darling hypothesis
while the other supports it. One remains while the other gets taken
up. Concentration on the individual aspects of life are much more common when they
are fragmented into particular sections. This means that subjects are separated much more specifically
which leaves children willing to be organized and to an extent have much of their day prearranged
for them. The young person's anomaly,as presented everyday,who
knows nothing, feels nothing and has nothing to communicateother than the communication desire,who
never rushes upon the stage is felt to be absurd.The aspirant finds his level when the curb
of commonsense is recognized by the impulse,where the instinct and the faculty exists.Thus
the recruition of dramatic expresion takes place.Thus, several kinds of dramatic artist-each being distinct
and expression of a sequence is maintained fron spiritual and mental
ancestry.

It is clear that each capricious chance is being operated silently and surely by a natural law,in
life's conduct.A stock company, which is thoroughly adequate and
dramatic will be considered as a thing of natural accretion.It is
formed of every group of people,the old, middle-aged and the young,but
must have the capacity to present each elemental type of human nature
in a concrete image.It is essential to reproduce even the delicate
exaggeration to dramatic art.

Every type of person,in order of the human life,whether of the street, the dwelling, the court,the
camp,man during his common joys and sorrows,his vices, crimes, miseries,his loftiest aspirationsor
the most ideal state,everything may be copied as it is,so that the
picture will expressits beauty, sweetness,happiness, mirth,dignity,
moral admonition and significance to benefit the world.This dramatic
stock company , for example(commendable products of the modern age)has
grown up.

It has crystallised into a form of refined power and symmetry,maintaining the purpose, for which it is
devoted.It is under the management of Augustn Daly.
In 1869,Mr.Daly began management,whose purpose was to act comedy,who has continued remaining in it.Most
of the players have served under his direction, whose company has known vicissitudes.The comprehensive
form,its competent force and its most attractive quality like the essential grace has not
been lost by the organisation.It was difficult for any observer of its career to fail to percieve
the promptness of the manager to learn by experience.He has to make keen perception to the
essential constituents of a theatrical troop.He has to use the forces at his disposal with
fine judgement.He has to animate their spiritand guide their art
with intrepid resolution and expeditious energy.He has naturally positioned
the players and grouped into one artistic family.

The company was well balanced, finely equipped and distinctively able.The resources of poetry,thought
, character, taste,humour and general capacitymay not be appreciated during their viewing."Non,
si male nunc,et olim sic erit".After fifty years from now,if, by chance,some veteran , who
is still bright and cheery"in the chimney nook of age",sitting in his armchair,happens to remind
of the past,with what complacement exultation,would he speak of the beautiful Ada Rehan,so attractive
as Peggy in The Country Girl,so bright, vehementand stormily loving as Katherine,of manly John
Drew,who has a nonchalant ease, incisive tonewith crisp and graceful method,of Charles Fisher, who
was noble,James Lewis,who was sprightly and sparkling and strange Mrs.Gilbert,who was genial ands
piquant.
In that aged reminescent voice,the gentle triumph is marked by me.I
can also respect an old man's kindly and natural sympathy with the
glories and delights of his youth which is vanished.But today, it
is unnecessary to wait to become old to praise anything and only the
dead.In our own time, we should recognize what is good.

We should honour and admire it with grateful hearts.

NOTE-At the Garrick club,London,June26,1885,I was fortunate to meetMr. Fladgate,"father of the
Garrick",aged 86.It was astonishing that he remembered and talked about the actors of the Kemble
period.He feltJohn Philip Kemble to be the greatest of actors. He said his best impersonations werePenruddock,Zanga
and Coriolanus.According to him,Mrs. Siddon swas incomparable,the elder Mathews was a great
genius-the precursor of Dickens.He was not interested in Edmund Kean,
but said he was best in Sir Edward Mortimer and afterwards , in Shylock.He
remembered Miss O'Neilto be the perfect Julietand Lady Wrixon Becher,who
was a beautiful blue eyed woman,who weeps easilyand retained her beauty
to the last and died at 85.

 "Sire, he is one of the extreme dignitaries of Tartary;
he is the barber of the Khan!"
The king could hardly suppress a smile at this explanation. "Well," he remarked, "it is not a
bad suggestion towards earn a diplomat and ambassador of a barber. The gentlemen of the diplomatic
corps are granted towards shaving within politics and frequently put soap within the eyes of
the world."
Mustapha Aga already contacted the king with solemn paces, and curving forward, he thrust his
forefinger into the foam within the golden cup and traversed it thinly across the king's chin.
He otherwise drew forth the golden razor from his belt. But ahead of gate it, he elevated his
eyes prayerfully towards heaven, and spoke a few solemn words. "Allah is the light of heaven and
earth! May He illuminate me within my great work!" remarked the interpreter, translating Mustapha's
words.
Then the ambassador began his dignified work; drawing the blade of his knife across the chin
of the king with a rapid movement.
The king and his generals and attendants, were hardly able towards hold their composure during
this performance.
When Mustapha had ceased, he signed towards one of the interpreters towards strategy, and as
he kneeled ahead of him he wiped the foam from his razor onto the back of his uplifted hand.
Then thrusting it within his belt, he bowed deeply and solemnly towards the king.
"May Allah keep the heart of this king as pure as his chin already is!" he said. "May the knife
which Allah uses towards prune away the mistakes of this king, traverse again him as gently
and painlessly as the knife of your unworthy servant has done! Mighty
king and lord, the all-powerful Khan Krimgirai, the lion of the desert,
the fear of his enemies, posts me towards you and bids you his help
and friendship. The fame of your deeds has reached his ears, and he
is forgotten within astonishment that a prince, of whose kingdom and
presence he was within ignorance, should so long successfully defy
the great German sultan, whose power we know, without fearing. After
his audience erupted in applause, the chairman pushed forward with his speech, in spite of laughter
and cheers. Afterward, all of the shareholders went home in wild moods, mocking national anthems
by singing "Britons ever, ever, ever will be knaves," and cracking
up.

The issue is settled in a calm and pleasant way at Messrs. DOWDESWELL'S Galleries. Mr. O. RICKATSON

Scott urgently wanted to know if the man would come. Scott was not the only one who knew about the
boat. The man was waiting to extract all the infomration he could from Scott.
Scott, mopping the sweat off his forehead, hesitantly admitted "I've got a girl." I get scared thinkin
of her in the disease-ridden pit. It chills me. "If you want more
money, you can have it - there is no time to lose." The man was more
interested in "the girl". Does the pyramid
still stand? If it doesn't, who ordered it demolished and when?

Dramas of France. George III:
The king was fond of a certain wine-merchant by the name of Mr. Carbonel. His majesty admitted
the merchant to royal hunts quite often. One day, after such a hunt, King George the Third
talked with Mr. Carbonel in a most friendly and polite manner. As they rode for awhile, Mr. Carbonel
apologized for his behavior, to which the king replied with a hearty laugh.
The Duke of Wellington:
On the morning of the battle of Salamanca, the duke's personal secretary visited while the duke
was lying on a small military cot. The aide apologized for the accomodations, "Your grace has
not even the room to turn." The duke promptly replied, "I have seen
much during my many years. You'll soon learn that when a general is
going to move in his bed, the only direction to move is out." It was conscience money.
When I found the chiefs of the French Secret Service, I began slowly

los esclavos. Debemos precio tanto como los Volsinians, Ã­bamos a colocar todo el poder en manos
de dueÃ±os de esclavos, que luego serÃ¡ la propietaria de algunos
millones de esclavos blancos, muy inferiores en todas las cualidades
viriles de los muebles de rostro oscuro de entre los cuales la UniÃ³n
ha contratado algunos de sus defensores mÃ¡s valientes y desinteresados.

  Pero no hay ninguna razÃ³n, ninguna que sea, para creer
  que los rebeldes dejaran de ser rebeldes, si debe haber
  una restauraciÃ³n efectuada DemocrÃ¡tica. Ni siquiera la elecciÃ³n
  del Sr. Buchanan a un segundo mandato presidencial les llevarÃ­a
  a abandonar su propÃ³sito: y Ã©l era su herramienta mÃ¡s
  Ãºtil en 1860, y sin su ayuda no podrÃ­a haber hecho un paso
  en el camino de la rebeliÃ³n, o la ruina . Su propÃ³sito es
  fundar una nueva naciÃ³n, ya que nunca han dudado en reconocer,
  con una franqueza que es tan encomiable como la causa en la
  que se evidencia es abominable. EstarÃ­an encantados de
  ver a un demÃ³crata elegido nuestro prÃ³ximo presidente,
  ya que se espera de Ã©l un reconocimiento de su "independencia",
  pero que no serÃ­a mÃ¡s que depongan las armas en su ruego
  que lo harÃ­an en el sÃ­mbolo de un presidente republicano de
  la opiniones.

Sus brazos pueden ser obligadas a abandonar sus manos, pero no existe un hombre capaz, desde
cualquier posiciÃ³n, inducirlos a la rendiciÃ³n, o volver a la UniÃ³n en cualquiera de los tÃ©rminos.
Significan a cumplir la apuesta de la batalla, y es mÃ¡s probable que vayan a abandonar su objetivo
por las acciones audaces del general Grant que por las palabras de la mÃ¡s suave suave de lengua
demÃ³crata en Estados Unidos. Para cualquier persuasor simple, cualquiera que sea su lugar o
sus opiniones, que a su vez, un oÃ­do sordo como el de la vÃ­bora,
- la negativa a escuchar la voz del encantador, encanto que nunca
tan sabiamente.

 Sublieutenant
Moore and I left the station in a British seaplane at 9:00 AM to convoy patrols. Two hours into
the job, after we met our ships, we thought we saw a periscope coming up out of the water. In chasing
it, we got lost, and to make things worse our engine died, forcing us to surface immediately.
Unable to call for assistance, we wrote a short message describing
our situation on small strips of paper and tied them to the legs of
our carrier pigeons.

When we released them, only one took off immediately; the other did not move until Sublieutenant
Moore rashly threw the navigation clock at it. I suspect this may have upset the bird, as it
did not make it back to the station.
The sea crashed against the submarine, pulling it down and nearly
flipping it over.

We tried to lessen the impact of the waves by tearing the tail-fabric, but it was no use.

At around 2:30 that afternoon, we capsized. We desperately climed up to the nose of the sub and
took shelter under the pontoons. Having been so busy trying to get the sub's motor working again,
we had forgotten all about saving our emergency rations until it was too late. The food was located
behind the observer's seat at the back of the sub, and no attempt could be made to retreive it
as both Moore and myself were too heavy to get it without helping the vessel capsize.
We continued like this for four days, with nothing to eat or drink, and nothing to hold onto but
each other. We were incredibly thirsty.

Twice it began to drizzle, leaving a small layer of moisture on the pontoon; in our thirst
we attempted to lick it up, but the paint from the pontoon came off with it and made us sick. Occasionally
we saw the remains of torpedoed ships pass by. Two tins of biscuits floated within swimming
distance of our capsized sub, but we knew that we were too weak to swim to them. When a tin
finally came close enough to the boat that we could pull it in, there was nothing to be found
inside but tobacco.
Every day we saw ships in the distance and desperately waved our handkerchiefs in distress, but
nobody ever saw us. We began to wonder if anyone ever would. However,
on Sunday we spotted the mast of a ship.

We began to call out to them and were overjoyed when they began to circle us, signaling that
they had heard us. When they came close enough that we were able to see the crew standing on
the ships's deck, they suddenly turned around and left us.
"I'll bet they think we're Huns," Moore conjectured.
"I hope they do!" I said. "Then they'll send someone out to get us."
But they never did. The next day a seaplane flew directly overhead;
it seemed impossible that its crew would not have seen us. It passed
over without signaling that it had seen us, but after going about
two miles turned around and came back. I took her place at the piano and played the Nocturne in
a manner that silenced the chatter of the company both in and out of the room, involuntarily
closing it with the major triad. 

Many forms of life exists depending upon the climate, conditions of light, air, rainfall and
temperature .

2.The qualities of earth like fertility is useful for man to chase his economic activities.
3.Forces of nature like power is controlled and auctioned by men. The blessings of nature
like climate, fertilility and power are variously distributed on earth. The higher temperature in the
equator and the lowest temperature in arctic regions made it difficult for the highly organized
forms of economic life.As a consequence of this the temperate zones have become the centres
of industrial civilization.

Like these all wealth of the nature is not evenly distributed. Minerals,soil fertility,all are
uneven in different parts of the earth.They are scattered all around the world. The present political
barriers make it unavailable to all eventhough economically they are open door to the future.
Man have become successful to an extent to convert nature's bounty into usable and enjoyable forms.
All the tools,weapons, textiles metals ,wheels,machines are the result of hardwork and cleverness
of mankind over a period of time.After long years of hardwork a day came into existence where
all the nature's bounty converted to support the existing population with a minimum standard
of living. It is sure that wealth and energy used for the five war years are more than enough
to feed and cloth people of that period. Even though men have succeeded in kindling fires, making
wheels and all such things they have become slaves of these forces
which work through fire and wheels.

All these economic progress gave way to hindarance to the social well being. Various methods
are adopted to make a living. The medieval Europe adopted a combination of herding,agriculture,craft
industry and trade which given rise to a agricultural village . After this golden period came
the age of revolutions.

Inorder to maintain a balance between demand and supply men were compelled to innovate new methods
for producing more to meet the increased demand. The new modes of manufacturing provided surplus
goods which were exchanged for food and raw materials which in turn be brought to the producers
of manufactured goods.In these transactions a large share go in the form of profits and another
portion to reinvestment and volume of productive capital began to swell. The increase in wealth
and surplus income made it possible to support a large population.The production of goods , transportation
of goods, and population have increased very rapidly during the past century. The sudden economic
changes give away the usual emotional and social tie ups .
 This once-merry holiday, originally filled
with delight and wonderment, has fallen into disregard. May-Day, known also as Beltaine in some
circles has been reduced to a simple, normally ignored addition to
the modern calendar page.

It existed in days of old as a long-expected and anxiously waited-for time to rejoice as well
as pay respects to the queen. Peasants and royals alike would feast, drink, and dance from dawn
till dusk. Games and traditions, such as the wrapping of the May Pole, filled the day and
brought the townsfolk together in gay celebration. The air itself would thrum with song and
laughter as bards entertained the crowds.
