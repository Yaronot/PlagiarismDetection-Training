Seeing that the two vaults were beginning to close in on the round window where the lantern
was to rise, it now remained to Filippo (who had made many models of clay and of wood for both
the one and the other in Rome and in Florence, without showing them) to make up his mind finally
which of these he would put into execution. Wherefore, having determined to finish the gallery,
he made diverse designs, which remained after his death in the Office of Works; but they have
since been lost by reason of the negligence of those officials. In our own day, to the end
that the whole might be completed, a part of it was made on one of the eight sides, but by
the advice of Michelagnolo Buonarroti it was abandoned and not carried further, because it
clashed with the original plan. Filippo also made with his own hand a model for the lantern;
this was octagonal, with proportions in harmony with those of the cupola, and it turned out
very beautiful in invention, variety, and adornment. He made therein the staircase for ascending
to the ball, which was something divine, but, since Filippo had stopped up the entrance with
a piece of wood let in below, no one save himself knew of this staircase. And although he was
praised and had now overcome the envy and the arrogance of many, he could not prevent all the
other masters who were in Florence from setting themselves, at the sight of this model, to
make other in various fashions, and finally a lady of the house of Gaddi had the courage to
compete with the one made by Filippo. But he, meanwhile, kept laughing at their presumption,
and when many of his friends told him that he should not show his model to any craftsmen, lest
they should learn from it, he would answer that there was but one true model and that the others
were of no account. They had chiefly show to model when the Scotch at Work; and one appears to own

maner by this berer, my filippo but servitor, David Wood. Whereupon Filippo, removing the small piece of wood
that there was at the foot of the model, showed in a pilaster the staircase that is seen at
the present day, in the form of a hollow blow-pipe, having on one side a groove with rungs
of bronze, whereby one ascends to the top, putting one foot after another. And because he could
not live long enough, by reason of his old age, to see the lantern finished, he left orders
in his testament that it should be built as it stood in the model and as he had directed in
writing; protesting that otherwise the structure would collapse, since it was turned with the
quarter-acute arch, so that it was necessary to burden it with this weight in order to make
it stronger. He was not able to see this edifice finished before his death, but he raised it
to the height of several braccia, and caused almost all the marbles that were going into it
to be well wrought and prepared; and the people, on seeing them prepared, were amazed that
it should be possible for him to propose to lay so great a weight on that vaulting. It was
the opinion of many ingenious men that it would not bear the weight, and it appeared to them
great good-fortune that he had carried it so far, and a tempting of Providence to burden it
so heavily. Filippo, ever laughing to himself, and having prepared all the machines and all
the instruments that were to be used in building it, spent all his time and thought in foreseeing,
anticipating, and providing for every detail, even to the point of guarding against the chipping
of the dressed marbles as they were drawn up, insomuch that the arches of the tabernacles were
built with wooden protections; while for the rest, as it has been said, there were written
directions and models.

How beautiful is this building it demonstrates by itself. From the level of the ground to the
base of the lantern it is one hundred and fifty-four braccia in height; the body of the lantern
is thirty-six braccia; the copper ball, four braccia; the cross, eight braccia; and the whole
is two hundred and two braccia. And it can be said with confidence that the ancients never
went so high with their buildings, and never exposed themselves to so great a risk as to try
to challenge the heavens, even as this structure truly appears to challenge them, seeing that
it rises to such a height that the mountains round Florence appear no higher. And it seems,
in truth, that the heavens are envious of it, since the lightning keeps on striking it every
day. The while that this work was in progress, Filippo made many other buildings, which we
will enumerate below in their order.
