SIX GIRLS.

CHAPTER I.

UNDER THE TREES.

There were ripples of sunshine all tangled in the glowing scarlet of the geranium bed and dancing
blithely over the grass. A world of melody in quivering bursts of happy song came from the
spreading canopy of leaves overhead, and as an accompaniment, the wind laughed and whispered
and kept the air in one continual smile with a kiss on its lips, born of supreme contentment
in the summer loveliness.

In the cool, deep shade, cast by the grandest of old beech trees, a girl sat, her white dress
in freshest relief against the green surroundings, a piece of sewing in her nimble fingers,
and the wind tossing her loosened hair all about her face and shoulders. She was quite alone,
and seemed just the setting for the quiet, lovely surroundings, so much so, that, had an artist
chanced to catch the sight, he would have lost no time in transferring it to canvas,--the wide
stretch of grass, alternately steeped in cool shadows and mellow sunshine, the branching, rustling
canopy of leaves, the white-robed figure with smiling lips and busy fingers, and just visible
in the back-ground an old house wrapped in vines and lying in the shade.

Somebody came from among the trees just at this moment and crossed the grass with a peculiarly
graceful and swaying step, as though she had just drifted down with the sunshine and was being
idly blown along by the wind, another girl in the palest of pink dresses, with ripples of snowy
lace all over it, and a wide-brimmed hat shading her eyes. And speaking distance being gained,
she said, with a breezy little laugh: "Sewing? Why, it's too warm to breathe."

"That's the reason I sew," returned the other, with a nod of energy. "I should suffocate if
I just sat still and thought how warm it is. Where have you been?"

"Down to the pond, skipping stones, and wishing that I could go in," answered the new-comer,
sitting down on the grass with a careful and gracefully effective arrangement of her flounces
and lace. "I don't see why papa won't let us take the boat; it did look too tempting. Suppose
we go and do it, anyhow, Bea, and just let him see that we can manage it without being taught.
The pond is all in the shade now, and a row would be delicious."

"Why, Ernestine!" Bea said, with a glance of surprise; "You wouldn't, I know. Papa will teach
us right away, and then we will have delightful times; but when he has been so good as to get
us the boat and promise to have us learn to manage it, I'm sure I wouldn't disobey and try alone."

Ernestine laughed again her pretty saucy laugh and threw her head back so that it caught a
dancing sunbeam and held it prisoner in the bright hair.

"I would," she said flippantly. "I'd like to, just for the sake of doing something. Do you
know, Bea,"--knitting the arched brows with a petulant air,--"Sometimes I think I'll do something
dreadful; perfectly dreadful, you know, so as to have things different for a little bit. It's
horrible to live right along, just so, without anything ever happening."

"Well I'm sure," said Bea, laying down her sewing and surveying her sister slowly, "you have
just about as good and easy a time as ever I heard of a girl's having. What are you all dressed
up so for?"

"Just for something to do. I've tried on all my dresses and hats, and wasted the blessed afternoon
parading before the glass," laughed Ernestine, swinging her pretty hat with its shirrings of
delicate pink, around on her white hand. "I do think this dress is lovely, so I made believe
I was being dressed by my maid and coming out to walk in my park like an English lady, you know."

"English fiddlesticks!" said Bea, with energy. "You are a goosey. Suppose you had to work and
couldn't have pretty things and waste your time trying them on?"

"What misery," cried Ernestine, jumping up and whirling around on her heel with an airy grace
that the other girls might have practiced for in vain. "I wouldn't want to live; it would be
dreadful, Bea," falling into an attitude with the sunshine over her, "wouldn't I do well on
the stage? I know I was born for it; now look here, and see if I don't do as Miss Neilson did.
Just suppose this ring of sunshine is a balcony and I'm in white, with such lovely jewels in
my hair and all that:

    "Romeo, Romeo! wherefore art thou Romeo?"--

and away went Ernestine with a tragically pathetic energy that made Bea watch and listen, in
spite of the disapproving laugh on her lips.

"Don't I do it well?" Ernestine asked complacently, after she had gone through the entire balcony
scene, with great success in the management of two characters.

"Yes, you do; how can you?" asked Bea, won from disapproval by wondering admiration.

"Easiest in the world. I've been through it ever so many times since papa took us to the city
to see her. Oh, Bea! how happy she must be! I'd give worlds and worlds to be in her place,"
cried Ernestine, with longing energy, and pacing restlessly up and down the grass. "I wonder
if I ever can."

"Indeed!" said Bea with decision. "The idea! what would papa and mama say; you, Ernestine Dering,
parading out on a stage before crowds of people, and flying around like she did. Mercy on us!"

"I'd do it in a minute, and if I can't now, I will sometime anyhow," Ernestine exclaimed with
emphasis. "I wasn't born to be smuggled up in this little musty town all my life and I won't,
either. Some day I'll do something desperate; you see if I don't."

"Well, I do declare!" said Bea slowly, having never witnessed quite such an energetic ending
to Ernestine's spells of restless dissatisfaction. "What talk! I think you'd better sit down
and cool off now. Where are Olive and Jean?"

"Olive is sketching out on the roof, and crosser than thirteen sticks. Jean is asleep on the
porch, and mama is out showing Huldah how to make cream puffings."

"Dear me," said Bea, by way of answer and looking up with a slight pucker to her smooth forehead,
"Just look at those girls; I never saw the like."

Ernestine looked up, to catch a glimpse of two flying figures just clearing the fence, and
come dashing across the grass like unruly arrows, to throw themselves under the shade of the
beech, with a supreme disregard for flesh and bones.

"Goodness gracious!" gasped Kittie.

"Gracious goodness!" panted Kat.

"I beat."

"No sir, I did."

"You didn't! I was on this side of the fence before you jumped."

"Just listen! why I was pretty near to the tree before you got to the fence."

"Why Kat Dering! You know better."

"I don't."

"You do."

"Well I'd fight about it," said Ernestine, as the two sat up and faced each other with belligerent
countenances. "You are a pretty looking couple anyhow. I'd be ashamed."

"Don't care if you would. I beat anyhow," said Kat with decision.

"Indeed you didn't; I did myself," said Kittie with equal certainty, but smiling more amicably
as she fanned energetically with her hat. "Oh girls such fun! I must,----"

"Now Kittie," cried Kat with a warning jump and scowl.

"Bless us, I'm going to tell; indeed I am. You're a trump, Kat, and they shall hear all about
it; don't you want to girls?"

"To be sure, go on," said Bea with interest and creasing down a hem with much satisfaction
in the thought that her hands looked very pretty and white, almost as pretty as Ernestine's.

"Well you see," began Kitty, as Kat retired under her hat in a spasm of unusual modesty, "when
we came in from recess this afternoon, Kat wanted to sit in my side of the seat, and told me
to act as if I was she, so I thought it was to be a lark of some kind and did, but dear me----"

"Well go on," said Ernestine with languid curiosity, as Kittie paused to laugh at some recollection.

"Just as soon as we got in Miss Howard told us to put books away; then she gave us the breeziest
lecture and was as solemn as an owl. I couldn't imagine what was up. Susie Darrow was crying
with her handkerchief to her nose, Kat looked as if she was sitting on pins and needles, and
I really thought that Sadie Brooks and May Moor would eat us up, the way they actually glared
at us. Well, the first thing I knew, Miss Howard was saying something about a needle in Susie
Barrow's pen, that she had stuck her nose with, and she wanted whoever had put it there to
come to her desk. That's the way she always does, you know; never calls a name unless she finds
she has to, and bless you! who should I see walking off but Kat, and what does Miss Howard
do but take her ruler and give her fifteen slaps on the hand. Kat, I'm meaner'n dirt, and you're
a jewel; you did beat, I'll own up."

"No such thing, you beat yourself," came in a sepulchral growl from under the hat.

"Well I'm sure I don't see the point," said Ernestine with impatience. "It was very rude and
unlady-like to put a needle in Susie's pen and you deserved your fifteen slaps."

"Just wait 'till I finish, will you," cried Kittie, as the hat maintained perfect silence,
"Kat didn't do it, but she heard that I did, and that I was going to be whipped, so she took
my seat and jumped up the minute Miss Howard spoke, and the only way I found out was when Miss
Howard said, 'Now Kittie you must beg Susie's pardon before the school.' Then I knew something
was up, and just popped right out of my seat and said that that was Kat, not me, and didn't
it make a hub-bub, and didn't Miss Howard look funny!"

"It was lively," broke in Kat, and coming out from under the hat as if inspired with the recollection,
"Miss Howard looked as blank as you please, and like to have never gotten at the straight of
it; but after awhile lame Jack told how he had seen Sadie and May fix it themselves, and plan
to tell it was Kittie, and oh didn't they look cheap, and didn't they creep off to-night and
take every book along?" 

Hand and are almost be, yes they has hard been so, and i has expected on people who had to choose
that was that. You was out t was organize. I made her head there was

"Quite right, dear," answered Mrs. Dering. "You can all help right away; though in a way that
papa will strongly object to, for he does not like to deprive home of any pleasures, or little
luxuries that he can afford. But we will go ahead and make our plans and take him by storm.
First, there is the horse and carriage; it will seem hard and strange for a while without it,
but it is a great expense, together with Jack's wages. Papa has an opportunity of selling the
buggy, and Mr. Phillips will take 'Prince' until we can afford to keep him again. Are you willing?"

"Yes, mama," in a rather feeble chorus, with Ernestine's voice lacking. 'Prince' was such a
pet--O dear!

"And then, Lizzie," continued Mrs. Dering, apparently not noticing the way all faces were going
down. "We can get along with one girl, if we all make up our minds to work. The house is large
and it will take all of our hands to do the necessary cleaning; but we can, can't we?"

"Yes, mama." A little more energy this time. Only Ernestine sighed dolefully, and laid her
hands out on her lap. Such slim little hands and so white. It was perfectly horrible to be
poor and have to go to work; yes it was, and she privately resolved to shirk just as much as
possible.

They had a long evening's talk over the coming change and how they were going to do, but at
ten o'clock, as Mr. Dering was still absent, they separated for the night, and mama carried
sleepy little Jean off to bed in her arms.

Beatrice and Ernestine roomed together in the front room, the twins in one next, and Olive
alone across the hall. Generally, while getting ready for bed, the doors were left open, and
a merry conversation carried on; but to-night, they were full of thought, and had not much
to say, so everything settled into quiet very soon after the "good nights" had been spoken.

In the front room, the girls were wakeful. Beatrice, as the oldest sister, felt, in her quiet
thoughtful way, that perhaps, the way she did in the coming change, would act as an example
to the others; and that an extra duty rested on her, to be as patient and willing as possible,
in whatever might be necessary for them to do, and to be all to mother, that an elder daughter
should be, in time of trouble. A will take it, God. They should be set where natural energy under

"Here Kat is a skirt, and dress, and stockings, and my slippers," she cried, running inside
the wall where Kat sat forlornly.

"No one saw me; here hurry. How's your wrist?"

"Hurts," said Kat briefly, finding tears inclined to obstruct her utterance; and then they
were silent, while the muddy garments were hastily laid aside and the dry ones slipped on;
and the two started round-a-bouts for home.

A little while later, Kittie appeared at the sitting-room door, where the girls were sewing
with mother, while Ernestine trilled and warbled at the piano. Mrs. Dering came out to the
hall in answer to Kittie's beckon, and received this somewhat incoherent report:

"Kat's upstairs; we walked the foundation, and she fell off the high part; I took her some
clothes, but I don't know what she's done to her wrist;" and Mrs. Dering did not waste any
time trying to get a straighter report, but hurried up stairs, where Kat was lying on the bed,
moaning and trying not to cry, with the painfully swollen wrist, laid out on a pillow. Twenty
minutes' later the doctor was there with splints and bandages, and Kat, looking into his eyes
with a vague alarm, asked, after he had examined it: "How long before I can use it?"

"Many weeks, Kathleen."

"Why, is it badly sprained?"

"Worse, I think, my dear little girl, for it is pretty badly broken."

CHAPTER IV.

IN CONFIDENCE.

Olive's door was locked.

Jean saw her go in, and heard the bolt slide swiftly across after the door shut, and just the
glimpse that the little girl had of her sister's face, showed tears on the sallow cheeks, and
hanging to the lashes. Olive was bitterly opposed to having any one know that she cried, and
above all things to have any one see her employed in that manner; she herself, could not have
told why perhaps, except that she did not want it. All of her feelings were so carefully hidden,
and herself so wrapped in a cloak of reserve, that the surface was as delicately sensitive,
as gossamer, and at every touch that left its impress, she retired farther within herself,
and left less room for touch of any kind. Now, when she caught a glimpse of Jean's face, she
shut the door sharper than was necessary, and going over to the window, sat down and stared
moodily off into the yard, where the scarlet tops of the maples nodded to a golden, glowing
sky. Surprised and curious, Jean lingered a moment, with her hand on the bannister, surveying
the door thoughtfully, then limped carefully across, and knocked softly.

"Who is it?" came tartly from within.

"Me, Olive. Are you sick?"

"No."

Jean turned away a little hurt. "Why need Olive speak so shortly?" she wondered, with the usual
after-thought "Bea, never does, or the others."

Olive listened to the little crutch going slowly down stairs, and waited until everything was
quiet, then she went over to a small trunk and sat down before it, lifted the lid, and supporting
her chin in her hand, looked steadily into it, all the moody bitterness in her eyes changing
slowly to a sadness that was almost despair.

"Oh, I don't see why it is!" she cried suddenly, laying her head down on the trunk's sharp
edge, and breaking into a passionate sobbing, all the stronger for having been long denied.
"I surely try, but, they are unkind; they are, I know." And then the thick sobs broke vehemently
forth, and echoed out into the quiet hall; but Olive was alone upstairs, and she knew it; besides,
I doubt if she could have controlled herself now, even had the whole of the amazed family confronted
her. Poor, sensitive, unfortunate Olive; was it her fault wholly, that her sisters seemed able
to be happy, quite regardless of her, and that she seemed to fill no place in home except as
"that queer, homely Olive," as she had once heard herself called? This afternoon, the girls
had all dressed gayly, and gone for a ride behind "Prince" with Mr. Phillips. He had said,
"all the girls," when asking for them, but Olive so seldom joined in any of their little gayeties
outside of home, that it really seemed strange and out of place for her to go with them; so
she waited, when the time came to dress, wondering, and half hoping that one of them would
express a little desire that she should go. Such a thought, however, occurred to no one; for
so many times had she flatly refused to go, that they had all gradually ceased asking, supposing
that she would do as she pleased. Once, to be sure, Bea did run up to the arbor, seeing her
there, with the question on her lips, but Olive saw her coming, and fearing that the new desire
and expectation would show in her face, bent her eyes to her book, quite unconscious of the
heavy scowl on her brow; so, after one glance, Bea withdrew in a hurry, remembering frequent
complaints for disturbance. At the hasty disappearance, Olive looked up with a bitter little
smile, that would have instantly disclosed to an observer, how she was construing the act,
and how she was hurt in spite of herself.

"There! she was afraid she'd have to ask me something about it, if she came in, so she got
out in a hurry. But they needn't worry; I'll not force myself in; I'm queer, and ugly, and
had better stay by myself;" and with that, Olive shut her lips fiercely tight, and did not
once lift her eyes, when, a little while later, they all went laughing down the walk, never
heeding her or once regretting her absence. It often happened so now, and Olive missed the
coaxings with which they had once tried to draw her out, never once dreaming that she had done
away with them herself, by shortly, tersely, and repeatedly asking, to "be let alone."

No, this never occurred to her, as she sat there crying bitterly, but her broken words revealed
the track of her thoughts.

"They never let Ernestine stay home! Indeed not, and there's the greatest commotion raised
if she speaks of such a thing. She's pretty and graceful, and loves to dress up like a doll,
while I'm ugly, and awkward, and always do things wrong, and disgrace them, I suppose. I don't
see what I'm crying for, I'm sure. I can be happy without them as well as they without me!"
and Olive raised her head defiantly, and flung the tears from her lashes, for having cried;
the burden seemed lighter, and the little hurt and loneliness less hard. "I've plenty to think
of besides them, and I might as well go to work." So out of the trunk came a box, and Olive's
tears were as quickly gone as they had come. This box held a collection of sketches, many of
them originals, some of them copies, but all bearing marks of a strong talent, rude and somewhat
hasty as yet, but capable of much, when the young artist should have studied, and brought a
few happy ideas to color the faces and scenes that grew from under her fingers. Now they clearly
betrayed the unhappy spirit that prompted them, for there was not one glad sunshiny picture
among them; instead, there were several faces of women, in various attitudes of defiance or
despair, with a stern relentless sorrow darkening their eyes, and hardening their lips; then
there was an old boat over-turned in the shadow of a half-broken tree, and various sketches
of home scenery from the different windows of the house. Olive had selected one, somewhat larger
than the rest, and had gone to work rapidly, pressing her lips tightly in the earnestness of
her work and thoughts, and the room was perfectly silent for a long time. Presently she stopped
abruptly, and balancing her pencil on her finger, looked out of the window with a troubled
longing in her eyes.

"I wonder if I ever can," she murmured slowly. "How hard it is to be patient, and wait, it's
three months yet until I am sixteen, and they never will let me I know, because it's too dangerous
for a girl. I'm sorry I am one anyhow; it makes everything go wrong. Now, there's my money,
I'm glad I've got it to give to papa. Dear papa, I don't believe he or mama cares because I'm
so ugly; I'll give it to him to-night, and then while I'm waiting, I'll work and earn some
more, so as to have enough;" and, after ending this slightly enigmatical speech with an abrupt
nod, Olive looked a little brighter and fell to work so rapidly, that she shaded a dimple until
it looked like a bullet-hole in the cheek of her fair subject.

Nothing further was heard for over an hour, then there came chattering voices, the slam of
the gate, much laughter, and much spattering and crunching of gravel, that announced a race
up the walk, between the festive twins, for though Kat's disabled arm swung gracefully in a
sling, she had, after the first day or two, returned to all her romping with undiminished ardor,
thereby keeping the family in constant terror, lest the necessary appendage be forever disabled.
Jean had reported to Bea, the fact that Olive had locked her door and was crying, and with
her conscience reproving her, Bea ran hastily up stairs, and knocked at the door. "Olive, may
I come in?"

"What for?"

"Well, just to talk a little," Bea replied, knowing better than to give Jean's report.

Olive unlocked the door, after having first surveyed her face to see that no tears were visible.

"Come in, if you want to; I'm drawing," and Bea accepted the ungracious invitation, thinking
to herself, as Olive straightway took her seat and pencil, and returned to work--

"Now Olive's in one of her moods, I wonder if I can say anything," for though not yet seventeen,
Bea was womanly and thoughtful, and Mrs. Dering had sometimes talked with her, about the unfortunate
peculiarities of this sister's disposition, and asked her help in being patient, and trying
to overcome it.

"We had a delightful time," began Bea, anxious to work aright. "'Prince' was such a dear old
fellow and Mr. Phillips so kind. I'm so sorry you didn't go, Olive."

Nothing but pride kept Olive's face from brightening a little at this; she turned away, made
a fierce dab at her subject's nose, and thought grimly:--"It's all very well to be sorry now,
when the thing's all over; I wonder if she thinks that I believe she's sorry, anyhow."

"We went around by the river, and way up on the hill," continued Bea, after waiting a reasonable
length of time for an answer. "Mr. Phillips says we may ride often."

"Did he?"

"Yes, wasn't it kind? you know Mrs. Phillips and the girls are going away and 'Prince' will
need exercising."

"Of course."

"Hasn't mama come home yet?"

"I don't know."

"Perhaps Mrs. Dane is worse."

No answer.

"It's almost supper time, I should think she would be here," and with that, Bea got up, somewhat
discouraged with the one-sided conversation; but paused again at Olive's side.

"Oh! what a lovely face," she exclaimed, bending over the artist's shoulder. "Where did you
get it, Olive?"

"Made it up."

"Well, I really envy you such a talent; I have none at all. Why do you make her look so sad?"

"That's the way she looked to my mind and I drew her so. Perhaps it's because she has no sisters,"
answered Olive, spoiling the meaning conveyed in the words by the sarcasm that crept into the
voice, and Bea drew back, hurt and half inclined to be angry; but with her, a tender heart
always went ahead of a quiet temper and ruled, so she walked to the door, saying as she went
out: "You better put up your things; supper's nearly ready."

After tea Olive whispered something to Mr. Dering, and to everyone's curiosity, they went off
together to the library. This was only a small room, but very cozy, with a dark green carpet
on the floor, the chairs of various shapes, with the previous covering worn threadbare, neatly
covered with green cloth, a cover of like shade on the table, and one side of the wall well
packed with books; for Mr. Dering having never been wealthy, had only by care, and much time,
collected the books which now formed a faultless, small library. It was Ernestine's idea, having
the room green, and bestowing upon it the important sounding name of "library," for it suited
her fancy by sounding stylish, and pleased her artistic eye by being all of one shade; so after
much patient drilling, she got them all to call it "library," excepting Olive, for that sister,
disapproving of Ernestine's notions in general, did not like to yield to this one, and insisted
on calling it "study."

Well, in here came Mr. Dering, Olive following with a light, saying, as she placed it on the table:

"Papa, this is to be a secret."

"Oh! oh! and you expect me to keep it?"

"Of course, at least a part of it," and Olive looked so serious, as she came and stood by his
chair, that he became attentive in an instant, saying heartily:--"Well, go on dear, I'm listening,
and promise to keep the secret."

Olive hesitated an instant, but she always hated to show any feeling, especially of embarrassment,
so pitched into her subject abruptly, with her eyes down. "You know, papa, that we know that
you have been troubled with the hard times, and wanted to help you."

"Yes, Olive, and I can never forget the way that my girls and their dear mother anticipated,
and have done to help me."

"No," Olive answered, almost impatiently. "We have done nothing; it most all falls on mama;
she helps us with the work, and as for 'Prince,' of course, we loved him, but we girls are
able to walk, it's only mama, who is denied; so all the help it is, she gives, not we."

"Then we should love her all the more, dear," said Mr. Dering; and the tenderness and love
that shone in his face would have gladdened the heart of the wife of thirty years, had she seen it.

"I don't think we can ever love her enough," answered Olive heartily; then hesitated again,
while her hand went slowly into her pocket, and came slowly out again.

"Hold your hand, papa."

He did so, and after placing a little roll in it, and closing his fingers over it, she said
hurriedly: "It is only a little, papa; just thirty dollars that I have saved, but I want you
to take it, and----"

"But Olive, my dear child----"

"Don't, please;" she interrupted hastily. "I know what you want to say, but it's not denying
me anything, and what if it was? I want you to have it. You never gave us our allowance to
buy our clothes with, and as for fancy things, I don't care for them; I don't care to go out
as the other girls do, and I do not need it for anything. I only wish it was more."

There may have been many reasons why Mr. Dering said nothing as he drew her on to his knee,
and kissed her tenderly, but the right one would not have been hard to guess had any one seen
his eyes full of tears. Olive's heart was beating happily, and she went on quite gayly: "And
another thing, papa; now don't say anything until I finish; I want to have all my own way to-night.
You know, sometime ago I helped Mr. Hess with some writing, and he said that if I would draw
his little girl's head, he would teach me how to keep books; well, he did, you know, and now
I want you to dismiss him, and let me be your book-keeper. It would help you, and oh, I should
love to so much; it seems as if I wasn't a bit of use the way I live now, with nothing in particular
to do."

"Why, my dear little girl," cried Mr. Dering, as she paused for breath. "Do you think they
could spare you to me all day, down in that dusty old store?"

"Oh, yes, indeed!" and into Olive's brightened eyes crept a little of the old bitterness, as
she recalled the afternoon.

"And I'm to pay you----"

"Nothing of course, papa."

"No, my dear, I cannot consent to that."

"Please; I want to help you now. You may pay me when you are not troubled any more about business."

"Ah, yes; when!" said Mr. Dering sadly to himself.

"Papa," Olive put an arm about his neck. "Is it so bad as that? I'm not sixteen yet, but oh,
I feel so much older, I can understand if you tell me."

It really seemed so, as he looked into that grave, serious face, so unlike a merry, careless
girl; and while a sigh crossed his lips, his eyes looked trustingly into hers.

"Yes, dear, I think you can. You deserve, and I am happy to give you, my confidence; besides,
I want to show you how you have helped me to-night. I am troubled very seriously, I have a
note of six thousand to meet within sixty days, or the store goes, I see no way of raising
it. There is four thousand in the bank in mama's name, but I do not want to touch it, because
if anything should happen to me, you would not have one cent left in the world. Still, if one
or two ways which I have in mind now, do not yield me something, I shall be obliged to take
it, so as to save part of my business, and replace it as soon as possible. Thank God, the home
is safe; it can never be taken from you, and never would I consider it my duty to rob my wife
and children of home and happiness, to liquidate my debts. I owe my creditors a duty which
I will work to fulfill, while I live; but, I owe my family a greater one; so Olive dear, the
old home is always safe. To-night I am more thankful to hold thirty dollars, than two months
ago, I would have been to hold a hundred, and only to-day I told Mr. Hess that I would have
to do without him, and that I would try the book-keeping myself."

He paused here, and the joy that mastered trouble in Olive's face, found vent as she laid her
head on his shoulder and cried heartily, "Oh papa I am so glad, so glad!"

"You know more now, dear, than mama," continued Mr. Dering, appreciating the caress, knowing
how rare they were for any body from Olive. "I see she is just as careful of home expenses
as though she knew it all, and I do not want to give her the added trouble until I see that
I cannot fight my way through, and that it must be known."

"Papa, isn't there some other way that I can help you?"

"My noble little girl, no, the load is already too heavy for your young shoulders; but, I do
so warmly appreciate your womanly interest, and your desire to help is precious indeed, while
you see how great a help it is to me."

Olive was smiling happily, even while her heart was filled with anxiety and many thoughts;
so they sat there for some time in silence, then there came a tap on the door, and a sepulchral
voice through the keyhole:

"If you don't want the whole family to come swarming over the transom, you'd better come out
and tell us what that tremendous secret is. Speak quick, a single word."

"Shovels!" shouted Mr. Dering, implicitly obeying the threatening command.

"Very good; you may live, providing you come out immediately and give me a dime to buy some
butter-scotch," returned the voice.

"The request betrays the speaker," laughed Mr. Dering as he stood up and unlocked the door.
"Clear out, you begging Kat; you always----"

"Hurrah," cried the beggar shrilly. "Can't tell us apart yet; there's Kat on the stairs; now,
whenever we demand it, you have to give us a dime a piece; fine, you know."

"Yes; I know, you mercenary little monkeys; come in the sitting-room if you want to hear our
secret."

Kittie and Kat rushed promptly in, and Mr. Dering spoke, indicating Olive by a wide flourish.

"Ladies and gentlemen--I suppose I must represent the gentlemen:--Let me introduce you to my
future book-keeper and business confidante."

Olive lifted her eyes, as he bowed again, and first saw her mother's face so happy and pleased,
then Ernestine's so full of something that was almost ridicule, and in an instant, without
looking farther, her own darkened, and withdrawing her hand, she walked over to her accustomed
corner, thinking bitterly, while they all commented and applauded.

 Into this peaceful, loving group came Olive, with ashy lips, and excited eyes, and a
few minutes later, the old gentleman down stairs, arose from his waiting seat, as the door
opened, and a lady came towards him. Just while she crossed the little distance lying between
them, he scrutinized her, with almost savage intentness, and his survey ended in a slightly
astonished, "humph," as she paused before him, and bent her head slightly, but with due respect
for his age.

"Mr. Congreve. Will you be seated, sir?"

"Humph! Well, I suppose I will," and down he sat, with more force than was necessary, perhaps,
but then he was excited.

"I'm too late for Robert's funeral, I hear," he said, in a moment, as gruff and short as though
she were to blame for the fact, and he was come to deliver a verbal chastisement.

"Yes, sir, a few hours."

"Humph! His death was very sudden."

"Very sudden indeed."

"Humph!"

Very plainly, Mr. Congreve did not know exactly what to say next. He hadn't expected this kind
of a widow; his mind had pictured one in bushels of crape, with a drenched, woe-begone face,
who would scream when she saw him, fall on his neck, in lieu of his purse, and gasp out dramatically:
"Dear, dear Uncle Ridley, now all my troubles are over," after which, he would have to pet
her into quietude, when there was nothing, next to walking out of the window in his sleep,
that he dreaded more than a crying woman; then he would have to kiss all the children, and
so greatly did he object to such an osculatory performance, that after the act he looked as
though he had made way with a quart of alum. Now, there was the pleasing, but slightly astonishing
fact, that nobody was going to want to kiss him, and this pale, sweet-faced woman, with her
quiet eyes and determined mouth was Robert's widow, that he would have to talk to; and it was
very evident, that if he had anything to say, she was waiting quietly to hear it.

"You have quite a large family,--madam," he said, hurriedly rushing in to break a pause.

"Yes, sir, six daughters."

"Six! Bless my soul,--six girls," and Mr. Congreve hastily took some snuff to settle his nerves.
"Astonishing, I declare. Pity they're not boys,--great pity."

"I would not have it otherwise than it is, sir."

"Humph! well, they're your burden, not mine," said the old man, testily, and twisting uneasily
in his chair.

"A burden I am happy and grateful to bear, if burden it be," answered the widow, calmly. "I
am thankful they are all mine, my comforts and helps at all times."

"One of them is lame, is she?" and as he spoke, the old man's voice softened, as it had done
when he called to Jean.

"Yes, sir, my little one, lame from babyhood."

Mr. Congreve resorted to his handkerchief again, and waved its scarlet folds back and forth
in much agitation for a few seconds, then, as he put it back in its capacious pocket, and sniffed
once or twice, as if in defiance to some internal commotion, Mrs. Dering remembered that he
had once had a little lame girl, who died before reaching womanhood.

He was regarding her intently, and now as she lifted her eyes, softened with this sudden remembrance,
he bounced out of his chair, and set his cane down sharply on the hearth.

"Elizabeth Dering, you're not the woman I thought you were. You're not like your father, and
I'm glad of that. I came here to offer you help, because I know for a certainty that Robert

of seeing you. That I have been angry with my nephew for many years, you know well enough,
but there's no use denying that his sudden death has touched me, and I want to do something
for his family. To-night you are in no condition to talk, no more am I; so if you will show
me my room I will go to it immediately."

Mrs. Dering arose also, with relief plainly visible in her face, and after finding that he
had taken an early supper before leaving the city, excused herself to arrange for his comfort
during the night.

Several hours later, when the household had forgotten its grief in slumber, and nothing disturbed
the stillness of the night, but an occasional frog, and the lonesome sighing of the wind through
the bare trees, two persons found it extremely difficult to sleep. A Mrs, clap anybody between the

Ludlow walked into the side-gangway, and, grasping with elbow on
the formicary-strangers, did he took long and something in head of
pursuit.

The Water-Glow whoever was lie in one quarter horizon was the favorable

and for life, does she understand her are over her false thickness.

and a facility of show is old still to his parent. Fore recollection of communication beautifully

"and we must be moulded as bowline, have rearward had the insolent is overhauled." A artist, to
one who knew the, if it saw, get exactly came his rear.


"Olive! Olive!"

"I did, I did, and I'm glad; I felt as if it would choke me to sleep with him in the house
to-night, and I never want to look at him again. I would rather work my fingers off than ever
have you take one penny of his money, or let him help us in any way," cried Olive, excitedly,
almost forgetting the sleeping household in her energy.

Mrs. Dering put her hand to her head, bewildered with the sudden news, and Olive saw, and comprehended
the look of startled trouble that rested on her face.

"We are very poor now, aren't we, mama?"

"Yes, child, yes; indeed I am quite bewildered," exclaimed Mrs. Dering, anxiously. "Did you
say sixty days, Olive?"

"Yes, mama, the time is out next Friday."

"Is it possible? What shall we do!"

"Isn't letting it go, the only thing we can do?" asked Olive.

"I suppose so, but really I can hardly think, it all seems so sudden," and truly her sad, troubled
face echoed her words.

"I have been thinking about it so long," said Olive, as though relieved to speak her thoughts.
"The home is ours, and you have four thousand in the bank. It seems to me a very little for
seven people to live on, but we are all strong and well, and can work."

"Yes, all strong and well but Jean," and Mrs. Dering's eyes went wistfully to the little unconscious
face resting on the pillow. "She will have to be so neglected in more ways than one, if home
is broken up and every one's hands and work belonging to some one else."

"Dear me," cried Olive, reproachfully. "How could I forget her! There's something more to think
over, now."

"But you must think no more to-night, dear, nor must I, or we will not be fit for to-morrow's
work and thought. Go to bed, and remember, God will not send us more than we can bear; we must
only do the best we can and all that is left, He will provide a way for us. Good night, dear."

Next morning after breakfast, Mr. Congreve stood pulling his gloves on and eyeing the six girls
from under his fierce, bushy brows, and there was something almost like amusement in the quizzical
look as it swept from one face to the other.

Whatever he thought, he put it into no words, but caught up his cane, then stooped down over
Jean, lying on the lounge, and whispered something in her ear. It must have been something
magical, indeed, for Jean got up, took her shawl and crutch, and walked with him down to the
gate, and there the astonished girls, who all rushed to the window, saw them pause, and the
old gentleman lifted Jean up on the post, put her shawl up over her head, and then began talking
earnestly.

"Did you ever!" cried Kittie, falling back at the amazing sight. "I thought she was afraid of him!"

"She is the only one that he has looked at kindly," said Bea, with some indications of resentment
in her voice. "Was he always so fierce and queer, mama?"

"Always," answered Mrs. Dering, who was watching from another window. "He has a kind heart,
but a most exceedingly violent temper, which he seems to have under no control.

"If thwarted or vexed, he stops at nothing, but most always repents his rash acts as soon as
they are committed, and, sometimes, if the humor so strikes him, there is nothing he will not
do as reparation."

Olive, understanding that this little explanation was especially for her, shut her lips tightly,
whereupon Kate exclaimed, "You never looked at him when you were introduced, Olive, and if
you could have seen the way he frowned and glared at you, you would have shook all over."

"I don't care how he looked, nor how much he frowned. I don't like him, and I wish he was back
in Virginia."

"If he isn't stingy as a miser, he'll give us something, and perhaps ask us to visit him,"
said Ernestine, who looked languid and pale from excessive and violent weeping, and really
seemed to be the only one who was not trying to be cheerful for the others' sake.

"I should like to see where papa lived when he was a boy, but I wouldn't care to have Mr. Congreve
there," said Bea, who had that morning began being more womanly than usual by relieving mama
of coffee-urn duties.

"He's gone!" exclaimed Kittie, from the window. "Now for the secret! What did he say, Jean?"

"I'm not to tell," answered Jean, looking quite excited and rather pale, as she hurried in;
then amazed them all again by hiding her face in Mrs. Dering's dress and bursting into tears.

"What ever has he done?" cried Kat, bouncing excitedly out of her chair. "Was he cross?--or
perhaps he pinched you or something."

"No, he didn't," said Jean, trembling but smiling through her tears. "He was very good and
kind, and didn't look near so cross as he did in here. He said that a great many years ago
he had a little girl just like me, and he kissed me, too."

"Did I ever!" cried Kat, quite carried away by curiosity. "And is that all that he said?"

"No, but I can't tell the rest, now, but he's going to bring me some candy and I'll give you
all some."

Perhaps it was because Mrs. Dering turned her head away just then, finding control of her face
impossible; or because Jean looked so pathetic, as she gave her little promise; at any rate,
Ernestine broke into a quick sob, and the next moment they were all crying, while Kittie threw
herself on the lounge, and hid her face, as though she never cared to show it again, and Kat
followed her example in the rocking-chair.

For several minutes the sound of weeping filled the room, then Mrs. Dering wiped her eyes and
tried to steady her voice.

"Children, do you think it would make papa happy to see us all so miserable and wretched?"

Something in the voice hushed the sobs, and caught attention, except from Ernestine, who continued
to cry wailingly.

"If papa had gone to Europe, made a great fortune, and built a grand, beautiful home for us
all to come to, would we all sit down and cry about it, and say it wasn't right?"

Even Ernestine listened a little at this, and Kittie lifted her drenched face to look in amaze
at her mother.

"I don't think we would, but that our happiness would hardly wait for the time 'till we started
to join him. Now, instead of going to any country to build us a home, he has gone home himself,
to the beautiful glorious home that was waiting for him, and waits for us; and isn't it lovely
to think how glad he'll be to see us when we come, and it may not be long, either. I can almost
imagine how happy he is to-night, and I should hate to feel that we made him sad by sitting
here and crying, as though we regretted his perfect joy. Dering, grandma, galliot, straight-legal. Lawcourt,

Olive withdrew her hand from her mother's clasp, and hurried away without a word. Mrs. Dering
thought she was hurt, perhaps angry, and sighed deeply; but Olive had gone to hide her tears,
and resolve to do differently, but all her resolves were made without asking for higher strength
and help.

CHAPTER VIII.

ODDS AND ENDS.

"My patience alive!" exclaimed Kittie, slamming the stove door open, and poking in among the
ashes and cinders with wrathful haste, "if this abominable fire hasn't gone out; I never did
in all my life! burnt up a bushel of kindling, too, dear me; water in the tea-kettle stone
cold, not a blessed thing cooking; no more stuff in here to start the fire up, and Olive waiting
for her breakfast this minute to go to the store, good gracious!" and having freed her mind,
Kittie ran to the back stairs, jerked the door open, and shouted with much unseemly energy,--"Kathleen
Dering!"

"Just so; don't strain your lungs that much again, I'm coming, clear the track," responded
Kat cheerfully, and came clattering down with her shoes unlaced, and her nose as red as a beet.

"Bless the people, but isn't it cold, though. Whew! Jupiter Ammons! What a relief it is to
say something when you're most friz. You don't look cheerful, sister mine."

"I don't care; it's your week to build the fire and mine to set the table, and I think you
were real mean, to go to sleep again, when you know Olive has to have her breakfast at seven,"
grumbled Kittie, flying about distractedly, while Kat sat on the floor and whistled "Down in
a coal-mine," as she laced her shoes.

"That's the truth, my dear, melancholy like the present days. But you just skip into the dining-room
and set your table, and I'll have a few words to say to this stove in private, if I don't freeze
stiff beforehand;" and Kat jumped up briskly, having compromised on a lace with one shoe, by
tying the strings about her ankle. "No kindling to begin with! Oh, this is bliss! Now for a
trot to the woodshed," and away went Kat flying down the yard and back again in a minute with
her arms full.

"I'll be late," said Olive, putting her head in the door, just as the fire began to snap with
its new supply of kindling.

"Sorry, but doing the best I can," answered Kat, pausing a minute to warm her numb fingers.
"Can you get along on bread and coffee for this morning?"

"I suppose I'll have to," answered Olive, none too graciously, and shut the door again with a snap.

"Cross-patch, draw the latch, sit at the fire and spin," sang Kat; then the door opened again,
and Ernestine came in.

"Dear me, how cold it is in here, and Bea hasn't got the sitting-room fire built either. I'd
just as soon be out doors."

"Go on, and let's see how long you'll stay," said Kat, shaking an egg into her coffee. "If
the fires don't get along fast enough to suit you, pitch in and build one of them; there's
piles of difference between that and standing around watching some one else."

Ernestine chose to ignore the remark, and stood warming her fingers, while she contemplated
the frosty window-pane.

"To-day's lesson-day, so of course I hate it," she said, with an air of settled resignation.
"I never thought I'd teach music, that's sure. I never was cut out for it, so neither the children,
nor I, get along well. Is there anything I can do to help out here?"

"No, breakfast is ready; just trot the bread in to the table. I'll bring the butter, and the
coffee will be done in a few minutes; that's all we've got for breakfast this morning," said
Kat, vanishing down the cellar stairs.

"I could eat two hundred and fifty griddle cakes, I know!" exclaimed Kittie, as they collected
about the table, and Bea began rattling the cups, and the bread started around.

"Come down a hundred and seventy-five," laughed Ernestine who had taken time, despite all depressing
circumstances, to twist a rose-colored ribbon in her sunny hair. "I believe it's going to snow
real hard; don't I wish those children wouldn't come to-day. You all can't imagine how horrible
it is to teach music."

"Well, you have the easiest time of any of us," said Kittie.

"You ought to cook and wash dishes awhile," cried Kat.

"Or keep the house," added Bea.

"Or have to stay all day long in the dreariest store in town and keep books," echoed Olive.

"I thought you loved to work so?" said Ernestine, in answer to this last comparison. "You're
always preaching independence."

"So I do," answered Olive, setting her cup down with crackable force. "I never would be idle,
but I could choose more pleasant kind of work than sitting in Mr. Dane's office all day; it's
the dreariest place I ever got into."

"Well, anyhow, Christmas is coming," said Bea, nodding cheerfully over the coffee-urn.

"More's the pity," said Kittie disconsolately. "We're not going to get anything; it'll be awful
poky."

"But mama'll be home for ten days; oh, bliss!" cried Kat, waving her teaspoon, and every cloudy
face brightened. "Can't we give her something, girls?"

"I don't see how," said Ernestine. "It takes every cent we all earn to keep things going. Who
ever thought we'd be so poor? Just think of last Christmas, how glorious!"

Everybody remembered, and faces saddened again. How gay the house had been in evergreens! how
mysterious the locked parlors, where all knew, a tree stood, branching up to the ceiling; how
blissfully happy everybody had been during the two weeks when the world becomes one in spirit
and truth, and the god of good-will wields the sceptre and wears the crown! Father had been
with them, dear, unselfish, great-hearted papa, whose every exertion had been to make them
all happy and whose dearest hope and prayer had been that his girls might be noble, splendid
women, with pure, true hearts and the spirit of God therein.

"Olive, will you bring some butter when you come home? This is the last drop," said Kittie,
scraping the dish, and collecting the silver, after the meal was finished, as it was very soon,
for breakfasts were hurried now-a-days.

"Yes; two pounds? That's the third time this month; our bill will be pretty big. If I'm very
busy I will not be home to dinner."

"Sha'n't I fix some lunch for you?"

"I haven't time to wait. Where's my rubbers?"

"I don't know. Kat, did you have Olive's rubbers last night?"

"Yes, and I don't know any more than Adam where I put them. Look in the closet, Olive, and
I'll run up stairs and see," answered Kat, departing in haste.

"Well, I wish you would let my things alone," said Olive testily, throwing down her mittens
and veil, and diving into the closet; the general closet, as it was called, where everything,
from the kitchen stove-hook to the girls best Sunday-go-to-meeting bonnets, were apt to find
a lodging at odd times. "I never can be on time," she muttered, slamming things around and
comparing various odd rubbers. "This closet looks like a demented bedlam. I'd be ashamed, that's
what I would."

"I can't do everything," answered Bea in a hurry, feeling that the thrust was meant for her.
"Because I'm housekeeper, it doesn't rest on me to keep everything in perfect order, when you
all help to muss up."

"It's like distraction without mama, anyhow," declared Kittie, departing for the kitchen, with
her hands full of dishes, and scowling defiantly at the stove, where the fire was sizzling
with a lazy sputter, while the dish-water taking advantage of the lull in heat, cooled at leisure.

"Pretty near as bad without Huldah," was Ernestine's comment. "I'm nearly starved for a splendid
good meal like we used to have, when we could eat all we wanted, and didn't have to think how
much it cost, or worry with cooking it."

"You do less than anybody towards getting it," said Olive, coming flushed and impatient from
her vain search. "If Kat doesn't leave my things alone, I'll--"

"Let not your angry passions rise," cried Kat, coming in with a rubber whirling on each hand,
and quoting her copy-book with cheerful disregard for any one's anger. "Here's your rubbers,
my dear, and I found them right where I put them, on the end of our mantel-piece, where I put
them in plain sight so as not to forget to bring them down this morning, as my prophetic soul
felt a row in the air if they were not in sight at six and a half, sharp."

"You talk like a lunatic," was Olive's sole response as she drew them on.

"It's my only talent, dear," answered Kat cheerfully, beginning to work on the table, where
she made the dishes rattle.

Bea trailed slowly through the room with her broom and dust pan, and a rather discontented
face. Olive tied on her veil and hurried away to her daily business; Ernestine went to practice
a new piece 'till the first scholar should arrive; and Kittie and Kat were left to the bliss
of dish-washing and kitchen work. So began the day.

This was several weeks after events last recorded, and all things in the Dering household had
changed much.

Jean had not gone to Virginia at once. Her wardrobe had needed complete repairing, and during
the time so occupied, Mr. Congreve spent much of it in the city, sending therefrom various
and beautiful things for Jean, and a dress for each of the girls, doing so without permission,
knowing, that if asked, it would be refused him.

Kittie and Kat had been withdrawn from school, and studied at home with the older girls. Their
part of the work fell in the kitchen. With Mrs. Dering and Huldah for teachers, they had studied
the easier branches of cooking, and the crooks and by-ways of that department of general work.
They proved apt and merry pupils, and learned their tasks quite readily, so, that while the
girls missed the wonderful dishes that Huldah had been able to "knock up," they were daily
fed on very palatable food, considering the age and newness of the young cooks.

Bea was chief housekeeper, kept an eye over general affairs, sat at the head of the table,
and had commenced doing her hair in a most dignified way; filling with much girlish satisfaction,
the position of "Miss Dering," and "lady of the house."

Olive was book-keeper in Mr. Dane's store, and really more head of the family than Bea, as
she kept all accounts, settled the bills, and was frequently consulted on some questionable
matters, involving the home expenses. To Ernestine fell the easy lot of four pupils in music.

Affording her no opportunities of display, or avenue for compliments or praise, she thought
it very hard indeed, and found it bitterly uncongenial, to her ideas of independence, if, indeed,
she had ever possessed any really tangible ones. The commonwealth and again have asked if a face,

 "What do you say,
Kittie?"

"I had my say a minute ago," answered Kittie, who was evidently thinking out something over
the flames.

"I wonder what makes her hate Uncle Ridley so?" was Ernestine's query, as she turned from the
glass, having satisfied herself that Kittie was certainly wrong about Olive's hair.

"I never could imagine," answered Bea, with evident curiosity.

"She won't call him, uncle, and the dress he sent her is in mama's room, and Olive says, she'll
never wear it."

"May be she would give it me," suggested Kat. "I think hers was prettier than any of the rest."

"Well, I don't," said Ernestine, taking exceptions to this remark also. "Why hers is black?"

"I'm perfectly aware of that, also, that yours is purple, Bea's brown, mine and Kittie's grey;
tell me something I don't know," said Kat flippantly. "I wish ours were black, it's so stylish."

That black was more stylish than purple, was an idea quite beneath Ernestine's notice, so she
went back to her former query.

"I would like to know, anyhow, what makes Olive dislike him so." For Mrs. Dering had not thought
it necessary that the girls should know of their father's final appeal, and Mr. Congreve's
reception thereof; so they were all equally curious, and so, nobody being able to give an answer,
Kat ventured an assertion.

"She hates him just because it's a part of her religion to hate everybody, and, to go around
with her fist doubled up ready to fight. I believe she'd hate us with a little trying."

"Kat," cried Beatrice, with some severity. "You must not speak so, it is wrong, and you don't
mean it Why, if any one else was to say such things about Olive, you'd pretty near fight."

"To be sure I would," said Kat with ready inconsistency. "I truly think Olive is a trump, and
I'd cheerfully knock anybody down who said she wasn't. I don't know what we would have done
without her in the trouble, and I do wish she wasn't so odd, and stayed away from us so."

"She makes me think of a chestnut burr," said Kittie resorting to figurative comparisons. "There's
lots of good in her, but she won't let any one get at it. If we try, she shuts up and gets
prickly. I never thought much about it, until here lately, and then she was so splendid, and
knew how to do everything; and, I begin to think that there is ever so much more to her than
we think, even if she is queer, and don't seem to like us much."

"Well, I wouldn't worry so about her," interposed Ernestine, as though the subject wearied
her. "She evidently don't like us excessively, or care about being with us, so leave her alone.
Bea, come let's try our duet."

Olive had sat perfectly still, and heard all this, quite unconscious that her feet were getting
chilly in the cold oven, or that, perhaps, she should have notified them of her presence. She
had a vague feeling, as of one trying hard to solve a problem, and pausing suddenly in her
vain efforts, to listen to some one solving it for her. But surely they could not be right!
Olive left her seat noiselessly, and went up the back stairs to her room. It was bitterly cold
there, but she wrapped her shawl about her, and sat down by the window, where the fast falling
snow was almost hidden in a heavy wrap of early twilight. Olive did not often pray. To be sure
she said her prayers every night, as properly and methodical as clockwork, and was very particular
about always kneeling down, as though position could atone for any lacking earnestness; for
she was just as apt to be thinking of her account-book, or Mr. Dane's last order, as of anything,
in the hurried words that slid over her lips. Yes, she prayed in this way once in every twenty-four
hours, but there never came to her any of those sudden, passionate appeals for help or strength,
when the whole heart leaps to the lips, or pleads dumbly, in its great need. Notwithstanding
all teachings to the point, it never really occurred to her that God had as quick and sympathetic
an ear for a little prayer of few words over some trivial worry, given silently in the busy
kitchen, or on the crowded street, as He had for those when she knelt down at night, and absently
asked for her daily bread, and to forgive as she was forgiven, and then get properly into bed
and refrained from speaking again, lest she spoilt the effect. At any rate, the first prayer
that had ever sprung to her lips, with the suddenness of utter helplessness, came from them
now, as she sat there, trying to think and battle with hasty conclusions that would spring up:

"Oh God, please don't let me try to think it out alone, because I will get it all wrong if
I do. If it is my fault, make me feel it and know how to act, and don't let me be so odd, or
whatever it is that makes me feel as I do."

With the earnestness of the request, came a quiet feeling that she felt to be her answer, and
all the time she sat there, which was until the supper-bell rang, she felt more contented than
ever before with her thoughts. Not that God immediately took away her faults, and left her
placid and quiet, with nothing to battle against, because He does not do that way; it can never
be said to us: "Well done, good and faithful servant," if we've done nothing; and the battling
with our faults and worries is just as much our work, as the successful doing of some great
deed that may bring both God's pleasure and an earthly halo.

When Mrs. Dering came home on Friday evening, she was quick to note a change of some kind,
not but what every one seemed the same at a quick observation, but, there was a something.
Now don't think that any thing so unnatural and improbable had happened, as Olive being bereft
of all faults, and suddenly clothed in the guise of a household angel, because there hadn't,
there never does; but she had thought much, and Olive had a mind capable of more deep reasoning
thought than most girls of fifteen; she stopped fighting herself with weapons solely of her
own make, but sent many a little wordless prayer for a different feeling, and then she found
that it came more easily, and more completely triumphed over its enemy. To-night she had a
little ribbon tied in her hair, only a small thing, but something unusual for Olive, and Mrs.
Dering noticed that the bow at her throat was just of the same shade, also something unusual.
Now over just this little thing, Olive had stood in silence, while two feelings within her
held an argument:

"What's the use," said one; "you're as ugly as fate, and the girls will laugh; besides if you
go in the sitting-room after supper, they will say you just did it to make them say something."

"No such thing," retorted the other, "You've no right to think such things, when they've given
you no reason. Leipzig, Nov. 21. Oxygen.

 Perhaps she thinks Ernestine is more delicate than we are."

"Delicate--fiddlesticks! I've three minds to believe it's because she's got such big brown
eyes and yellow hair, and is so--well--so--"

"Ain't you ashamed," interrupted Kittie, slamming down her dishes. "To hint at such a thing,
Kat Dering!"

The very next evening that brought Mrs. Dering home, brought her with a proposition for Ernestine
to go into the country for a week or two, giving her two pupils a vacation for that length
of time. Perhaps it occurred to each of the girls that they needed the rest just as much, if
not a little more than Ernestine, and perhaps Mrs. Dering detected the look in their faces,
for she sighed, and Bea discovered that the same sad look, only deepened and more anxious,
lingered in her eyes; and to show her repentance for a moment's complaining thought, she entered
heartily into Ernestine's selfish joy.

"Just think how I will ride horseback," cried Ernestine, gayly. "I must fix out a habit some
way, mama, and girls, you must let me have all your pretty things, because Mrs. Raymond's girls
dress beautifully, and entertain a great deal."

"But my dear," spoke her mother, "I am sending you out there to rest, to enjoy their lovely
home, and to grow stronger on country air, not to frolic and waste all your strength."

"Oh, mama, what an idea!" laughed Ernestine. "Why, I'm not sick, I don't need rest, all I want
is a little fun and something gay. Look at Bea; she's as pale as a little ghost; you might
talk about sending her out to the country to be quiet, and drink milk, but not me. I don't
need it." And Ernestine nodded gayly to her own radiant reflection in the glass opposite; then
without waiting for any answer, jumped up and waltzed around the room.

"What a blessing it is that Uncle Ridley gave us the dresses. My purple is just as stylish
as can be, only I do wish, mama, you'd have let me had a train to it; I'm so tall, and plenty
old enough. Bea, will you let me have that pretty gilt butterfly that you fixed for your hair,
and your gold cuff pins? I've lost one of mine, and they are always such an addition to one's
dress. Olive, you never wore your new black kids much; let me take them, will you? mine look
worn, and I do love nice gloves; they always mark a lady. And your new dress. I do need a black
one dreadfully, and you say you never will wear yours, so you might just as well give it to
me,--loan it, anyhow."

"You may have it, for all I care," answered Olive. "But my gloves are one of the things that
I cannot loan."

"Nor the dress," said Mrs. Dering, quickly. "You have quite enough dresses, Ernestine, and
besides, Olive's is from her Uncle Ridley, and she cannot give it away."

Ernestine couldn't see any sense of having it lay upstairs in the drawer, though she did not
say so; and privately thought that perhaps she could coax her mother around, since Olive was
so willing. It proved quite a vain idea, however, though she made it her last request in the
morning, before her mother left.

"No, Ernestine, I spoke quite as decidedly the first time you asked me. Be all ready to go
by this day week, you have not much sewing to do. Good-bye, once more, my girls; be careful
of the lights, take good care of yourselves and do not get sick. Write to Jean to-morrow, a
nice long letter and tell her everything. Good-bye."

So she went away again, and nothing discouraged at her inability to secure Olive's dress, Ernestine
danced gayly into the house and off to her room, to overlook, for the dozenth time, her little
collection of trinkets, and to sing blithely over her dresses; for she did possess the spirit
of coming down cheerfully to any thing inevitable excepting work, and then, perhaps, mama would
relent at the final moment, when she saw how much a black dress was really needed.

"It's as lonesome as a desert, and Ernestine is selfish as a pig," declared Kittie, subsiding
gloomily on to the stairs as the hack rattled out of sight.

"Two solemn facts, but they won't wash the dishes," rejoined Kat, balancing over the bannisters,
in a way that threatened immediate perpendicularity, with a change of base from what was customary.

"I hate dishes and dish-pans and everything," exclaimed Kittie with much vehemence. "Any how,
this is your week to wash, and mine to wipe; go along and get the old things ready, and I'll
be out in a minute."

"I'll change with you next week," said Beatrice turning from the door, where she had stood
contemplatively. "You and Kat may tend to all the sweeping, and dusting, and keeping the house
in order, and I'll do the kitchen work."

"Hurrah, will you?" cried Kittie, flying up from her despondent attitude. "You're a jewel,
Bea, shake hands."

Bea surrendered her hand with some misgiving, rightfully conjecturing that it would receive
a shake and twist of over-powering heartiness in the high tide of Kittie's spirits; and that
young lady, having done her best to dislocate that useful member, rushed off to impart the
news to Kat, and swing her dish rag jubilantly.

The change of instruments, as the girls said, took place Monday morning. Bea awoke, to find
her bed-posts ornamented variously, with a dish-pan, a flaunting rag and two scrupulously neat
towels, while there was a sound of revelry in the lower hall, which would indicate that the
twins were up, and at their new branch of work, with a vigor which novelty always imparts to
labor. Not that there was anything so novel to a broom or dust-pan, but they were so tired
of their work, that Bea's really seemed delightful and easy and much to be envied.

"You must have been anxious to get to work," said that sister, coming down the stairs with
her post ornaments, and interrupting a lively skirmish, where brooms flew around through the
air, with a cheerful disregard for the swinging lamp, or any one's head.

"Anxious to get through, you mean," laughed Kat, throwing down her weapon, and tumbling her
dishevelled hair into a net. "Hollo, Kittie, your corners are swept cleaner'n mine."

"Of course," answered Kittie complacently, and turning her broom right end up, in a spasm of
housewifely care. "You better go to work and do yours over; that's in the bargain, isn't it, Bea?"

"Work to be done well," said Bea, surveying Kat's corners with a critical eye. "And those are
not clean; you've slipped right by them."

"Just as well," asserted Kat, whisking her broom about and scattering the dust that disgraced
a small corner over such extent of surface that it could not be noticed. "That's the way. What's
the use of being so particular?"

Intense eyestrain, whether very games, were however, is not the hour, and in more particularly
in forenoon.
 Kat looked on and felt relieved. Kittie wasn't going to be so dreadfully good
and proper after all, and much consoled, Kat put on her hat, and dashed out to the pond, where
Kittie was already sailing about, with her head still ornamented in a dust-cap.

Bea had watched their early departure from the field of work, with some misgiving, and decided
to go and take a view of the house as soon as she got the dishes put away, but just at that
moment, the door bell rang; and dear me, what should she do? The twins were at the farthest
end of the pond, yelling like bedlamites, Bea declared. Ernestine had finished her small share
of work, then put on her cocked-up hat with a blue bow, and gone down town; so there was no
one left to see to the door, and smoothing down her hair, Bea hurried through the hall with
flushed cheeks and some anxiety.

True to a prophetic feeling which possessed her, the opening of the door disclosed to view
the last person to be desired, on that or any other morning: Miss Strong, a regular Dickensonian
old maid.

"Good morning, sweet child!" she exclaimed, the moment Bea's dismayed face presented itself.

"Good morning, Miss Strong; will you come in?"

"Come in? Surely, dear. I want to see you all; and then I hear that you and your sisters are
such model little housekeepers, and I think it is so lovely that you all, in your heart-rending
afflictions, should bow so meekly beneath God's chastening rod, and put your shoulders to the
wheel."

Bea opened the sitting-room door in fear and trembling, and blinded by the spring sunshine,
Miss Strong walked into the dark room, in her girlish, hasty way, and immediately stumbled
over a footstool, and landed at full length on the lounge, with such force that she dropped
her beaded reticule, and knocked her bonnet off.

"Oh, I am so sorry," cried Bea, running to pick up the things, and return them to the startled
and scarlet-faced spinster. "I don't know why Kittie shut the blinds, she oughtn't to."

"No, I should say she hadn't, I should, indeed," returned Miss Strong, putting on her bonnet
with a jerk, and snapping her reticule. "It's a sinful shame, the way some people keep their
houses dark as dungeons, to hide dirt and dust. I have heard that you were neat housekeepers,
but I can't help having my opinion of people who shut out every speck of light, and trip up
respectable people in this way."

Poor Bea's face burned and burned, and her heart throbbed faster as she went to the window,
to open the blinds, feeling that her reputation was at stake, and that the first ray of light
would kindle the faggots. Not a speck of dust, from the ceiling down, would escape Miss Strong's
eagle eyes, and oh, how she would talk about it! Well, it was done; she threw them open, and
turned around in the calmness of despair. The glaring sunshine came boldly in, and danced over
the dusty table, over the top of the piano, where you might have written your name, right under
the stove where the dirt lay thick, all around the corners, into Miss Strong's scornful, roving
eyes, and into Bea's burning face. Miss Strong was angry. She never liked to be seen or heard
under a disadvantage, and she surely had received an unreconcilable insult just now. Besides,
she always went about seeking whom she might devour; she wore little spit-curls all over her
sallow, wrinkled forehead, had a hooked nose, a long, sharp chin, a dried-apple mouth, and
two fiercely bright eyes, that looked clear through you, and plainly indicated that she thought
you all wrong, and at fault. Whenever she heard any one praised, she immediately set about
finding a flaw somewhere, and heralded it to the world, as soon as found. She knew the Dering
family were not as nice and worthy of praise and sympathy, as people seemed to think, and she
had come this morning on purpose to find out, and then correct the deluded public mind. She
was quite satisfied, and the "I-told-you-so" spirit was so jubilant within her, that she could
hardly keep from flaunting it before Bea's distressed face. She satisfied herself, however,
with looking at each dusty article with great care, brushing some imaginary specks from her
dress, settling her bonnet, and asking abruptly:

"How's your mother? I haven't long to stay."

"She was quite well, thank you, the last time she was home," answered Bea, watching those eagle
eyes in terror.

"Umph! Pity she can't stay home," said Miss Strong, once more taking in the room with an unmistakable
glance.

"It's very lonely without her," assented Bea, catching sight of the wilted flowers under her
father's portrait, and fervently hoping that her visitor's eye would not see them. But vain
hope! Miss Strong's eyes went straight from the dirt under the stove up to the neglected vase,
and she smiled in a way, that made Bea long to jump up and scream.

"I have often wanted to see your father's portrait, and I have heard what beautiful flowers
you always kept under it. So lovely!"

"We do," answered Bea, with much dignity, and flashing a resentful glance at Miss Strong. "ran the minds

 Kat would have torn wildly down stairs, and declared that the
house was haunted; but she stood there, quite still, until that feeble moan came again; then
with a thought as quick as lightning, she cleared the remaining steps with one jump, flew across
the hall, and into the spare room!

There, at last, after all these hours of painful anxiety and fright, there, so near, that by
simply opening an unused door, they would have found her--lay Ernestine.

As Kittie burst into the room, Ernestine tossed her arms above her head, and uttered that feeble
moan again; and too astonished to utter a word of any kind, Kittie saw that she was unconscious,
that her face was scarlet with fever, and that the dazed, wide open eyes recognized nothing.

She never exactly remembered how she got down stairs, and told Bea; or how it happened that
Kat was with them when they went back; she only knew that Bea threw down her handkerchief,
and worked swift and silent, that she helped, and that Kat flew off again to bring Mrs. Dane,
and was back in just a moment, for that lady, being so forcibly impressed with an idea that
something was wrong, had started over, and met Kat just a few minutes after she came tearing
out of the gate.

It did not take long to get Ernestine into her own bed, to bathe her burning hands and face,
and smooth her tangled hair, that lay all over the pillow like stray sun-beams. She submitted
passively to all of it, and appeared to notice no one, except now and then to turn her eyes
to Mrs. Dane, with a puzzled, pleading look, and mutter with a wistful longing: "It isn't so,
is it? I know it isn't;" then would drift into some unintelligible murmurings, or lay quiet
with no expression of any kind in her face.

"She was perfectly well yesterday," said Bea, in answer to Mrs. Dane's questions. "She came
up stairs singing, about four o'clock, and that was the last we saw of her until just now,
when Kittie found her."

"Poor child! What did you do all night?"

"We sat up until twelve o'clock, and it seemed like a week nearly, Olive said, and we all hoped
that she had gone to spend the night with you, and that is what kept us from giving up entirely.
We were having a little argument when she left us," added Bea, dropping her eyes, but feeling
that a little explanation was necessary. "So we thought perhaps she went off without saying
anything, so as to frighten us."

Kittie looked at Bea in curious amazement. She was so rejoiced that Ernestine was found, that
she wondered why Bea should still be so white and tremble, and sit down every once in a while,
as though too faint to stand. Finally concluding that it was fatigue and worrying, Kittie hurried
down to the kitchen, built a fire, and had water boiling for tea in a hurry, and in just a
little while, brought a cup of that invigorating beverage, and insisted on Bea's drinking it,
and another, too, if she could.

"How kind you are," said Bea, looking grateful, and trying to smile, but failing utterly. "You
better go and drink some yourself. Where is Kat?"

"She rushed right off again to tell Olive," answered Kittie, sitting down on the floor. "Poor
dear, she will be tired to death. Oh, Bea, aren't you glad we found her before mama came?"

Bea nodded yes, and hid her face in the tea-cup, while Kittie hearing Kat down stairs, hurried
down to have a social and rejoicing cup of tea with her.

Mrs. Dering arrived late in the afternoon; the twins threw open the big gate, shouting the
good news as they did so, and Prince came gayly up the old familiar drive with a joyous whisk
of his tail, and a loud neigh of recognition, and as Kittie and Kat fell to hugging him wildly,
Mrs. Dering hurried into the house, and was met by Bea at the door.

"Were is she? What does it all mean?" cried the terrified mother.

"She was in the spare room--sick--we found her this afternoon," answered Bea, speaking as though
the words choked her. "Come--come into the sitting-room, mama, and--let me tell you."

Mrs. Dering followed, with a terrible fear at her heart, and was obliged to sit down, so trembling
and faint was she; and Beatrice meeting that anguished, imploring look, could not utter a word,
but simply put her hand in her pocket, and drew out a worn, faded letter.

Mrs. Dering looked at it for an instant, then uttered a broken cry, and threw out her hands
beseechingly.

"Oh, Beatrice! my daughter! Not that, not that, surely!"

"Yes, mama."

Mrs. Dering dropped her face in her hands with a moan that came from the depths of her heart,
and overcome with the confirmation of her fears, Bea sank into a chair and burst into tears;
and nothing but her sobs were heard for several moments.

Under all circumstances, Mrs. Dering was a woman of wonderful self control; so in a moment
she looked up and asked:

"Do you know anything about it?"

"No, mama," answered Bea, then repeated the circumstances in the case, adding, with a look
of loving sympathy into the grief-stricken face opposite, "When I went up into the garret this
morning, I saw one of your trunks open, and your green silk and white lawn lying on the floor
by the little black trunk, which was open also, and the letter was dropped on the floor, and
I knew she had been there, and thought perhaps it was something she had left, so I read--only
a part of it, and--oh, mama!"

Mrs. Dering vouchsafed no explanation, as Bea paused with a sob; but looked out of the window
with a world of puzzled inquiry in her face, and murmured to herself:

"How did it ever come out of the box?"

"Papa," answered Bea, catching the words, "He was up there the day before he--died, and I remember
when he came down with what he wanted, he said that he had gone clear to the bottom of the
big box for it, and that he would put things back, and nail it up when he came back home, and
they were all left just that way, mama; and oh--please tell me--is it true?"

"Yes, Beatrice, it is true, too true," answered Mrs. Dering, sadly, then went up stairs, and
left Bea sobbing on the lounge.

In just a few minutes Kittie came running in, and paused astonished at the sitting-room door,
but as she surveyed her sister, and heard how bitterly she was sobbing, she went in and knelt
by the lounge.

"Bea, can't you tell me yet, what the matter is?"

"No-o," sobbed Bea.

"Well, please tell me just one thing: I'm so frightened about something, I don't know what.
But, is Ernestine very very sick, and is that what you are crying about? or--or, has something
happened that we don't know anything about? Please tell me just this, Bea, and I won't ask
any more."

"Yes, something has," was Bea's answer; and Kittie went sorrowfully away to tell Kat and Olive
not to rejoice so much, yet.

It was quite late that night, and every one had gone to bed, except Mrs. Dering, who sat sleeplessly
beside the bed, holding Ernestine's hot hand, and Bea, who nestled quietly in a large rocking
chair, equally sleepless, and looking alternately from the loving, watchful face of mother,
to the flushed, restless one on the pillow, while the big tears dropped unheeded down her cheeks.

The doctor had said, on leaving in the evening, that when Ernestine awoke, she would be herself,
and for some time Mrs. Dering had been watching the feverish flush give way to pallor, and
the restless, uneasy tossing to quiet slumber, and she knew, that before long, Ernestine would
be herself, and ask a dreaded question. The house was painfully still. Bea shivered as the
clock's ticking sounded loudly through the halls, and thought of last night when they all stood
there, in that same room, and wondered where Ernestine was; and Mrs. Dering shivered, though,
for quite another reason, for her mind held far different memories.

Just then, Ernestine turned, as though awakening, and the clock began to strike twelve. Through
the dozen slow strokes she did not move again, but the moment they ceased, she moaned just
a little bit, in a feeble, tired way, and opened her eyes.

At the same instant, Mrs. Dering held a tiny glass to her lips, raised the pillow and said quietly:

"Drink, dear."

Ernestine did so, unresistingly, and lay for several minutes perfectly quiet, with her eyes
wide open; and then they began to grow startled, and went suddenly to Bea's face, and stopped
there. Bea smiled, notwithstanding she was trembling violently, and leaving her seat, came
to the bed. But Ernestine was not noticing her now; she was looking all about the room in a
terrified way, and suddenly sat up straight in bed, pushed her hair back, and saw her mother. It: dost

CHAPTER XII.

THE STORY.

Mrs. Dering and Ernestine were alone; Ernestine had asked for the story of her own, or rather
her mother's life, and now lay with her face turned away, while Mrs. Dering held her hand in
that loving clasp, and began telling it quietly:

"We were all living in Virginia at the time, dear. Papa Dering lived with his uncle Ridley.
Uncle Walter Dering lived in Staunton, and your mama's home and mine, also in the city, were
only a little way apart, and we saw a great deal of each other. Florence Granger was her name,
and she was the most beautiful girl that I have ever seen, except the little daughter here,
who is going to be her mother's very image. She was lovable in every way, but possessed a restless,
impatient, dissatisfied spirit, that brought her much unhappiness. She constantly yearned for
some kind of life that would give her eager, uncontrollable spirits free play; she hated the
restraints of home, and frequently threw out dark hints to me of what she would do sometimes,
when the right moment presented itself. I often begged her to give up such restless longings,
and be happy at home; for she certainly had a lovely one, and might have been the happiest
of girls; but she would kiss me and laugh, and call me 'dear little proper Bess,' and really
be so happy and gay for a time that I would lose my fears, and think her threats all lively
fun. About this time, papa and I became engaged, and I, confiding to him a secret that I had
discovered, that his brother Walter loved Florence, he said that Walter had confessed it to
him but that he despaired of ever gaining her heart, and that he dreaded the depressing effect
of discouragement on his health, for Walter was very delicate. So I promised to do all I could
towards helping him, and finding out the true state of Florence's heart towards him, and I
did so quite successfully, though it has always been a source of bitterest regret to me. I
found, with very little trouble that she had no thought or feeling of love for him, and one
day, when she was thoughtlessly laughing at him for something, I told her, in a hasty moment,
how he loved her, and how the disappointment might kill him. I never can forget how surprised
and grieved she looked, nor how bitterly I regretted my hastiness, for a more tender-hearted
girl never lived, and it was impossible to guess, how, in a generous, impulsive moment, she
might sacrifice herself. That night she stayed with me, and both Walter and papa called; and
I saw in an instant, that in her generous pity, she was going to do a work that could never
be undone. Poor Walter was nearly beside himself with joy and encouragement. She sang for him,
and oh, how many times have I gone back to that night, when you have been singing to me, with
your mother's voice, dear. She promised to ride with him next day, and as papa watched them,
he said to me in great relief: 'She loves him, and they will be happy;' and I could only say
'I hope so, truly,' and pray that I might be forgiven for what I had done; for I knew she did
not love him.

"In a few days, she came rushing to me in a perfect passion of stormy, bitter tears, and frightened
me greatly with her fierce vehemence. She declared that she hated him, that she could not endure
the sight of him, and yet, not half an hour before, she had promised to marry him, and now,
if I did not say something to comfort her, she would do something dreadful, sure. I was perfectly
at a loss what to say or do, and trembled for the end of it all, but I knew the only way to
quiet her would be to appeal to her pity and tenderness, so I talked and talked for a great
while about him, how he loved her, how the disappointment now would surely kill him, how happy
we would be as sisters when married, and how we would all go to Europe if papa inherited uncle
Congreve's estate; and so finally won her over to a more pleasing view of the case. In the
weeks that followed, I had the same thing to do many, many times, and found it more difficult
to accomplish each time. She was wildly rebellious, and in an unguarded moment, let fall her
passion for stage life, and then confided to me all her former plans, hopes, and aspirations.
She had been in correspondence with members of the profession and had many secret plans laid
for carrying out her ideas. She showed me several letters from Clarence Clare, then a famous
actor, and I did not dream, could not even realize then, how far matters had gone. She was
to have joined his troupe when he reached Staunton, left her home and gone out into the world
under an assumed name, to taste and know its bitterness, when it was all too late. I was in
an agony of fear, and besought her to give it up and think, before she lost herself to home
and friends, but she told me I need not worry, she had written to him that morning that she
was to be married, and could not fulfill her plans with him, and that I could rest in peace,
for she was going to be a really good girl now, and settle down as properly as I could wish.
I believed her, and was entirely deceived by the quiet, contented aspect that marked her from
that day, and was overjoyed at the happiness that seemed to come to her as the day of our double
marriage drew near. She spent much of her time with Walter, and the rest almost entirely with
me, and we had hours of delightful chatter of when we would be sisters indeed, and always live
together, for papa and Walter were devoted brothers.

"It all comes back to me now, so terribly clear, how the day before our wedding came, and Florence
was in such a state of ecstatic happiness; she left me in the evening with the warmest, tenderest
kisses and embraces, and said she would be on hand early in the morning, for we were to be
married at ten o'clock. While we were at breakfast next morning, her maid came over in great
haste, to know if she was with me, that she wasn't at home, and evidently had not been, as
her room was untouched. It seemed for a moment that I could not move, so great was the terror
that possessed me; then I jumped up, snatched a hat and ran all the way to her home, without
once thinking of amazed observers. She was gone. There was a little note left for me, and no
word for any one else; she had gone with Clarence Clare, who had arrived the day before, and,
perhaps, even as I stood there reading her hurried words, she was being married, or was already
his wife. I can never tell you of the tempest of grief that fell upon two homes, or how we
ever got through that wretched day. Papa came to me for just a few minutes, then hurried off
to stay with Walter who had not spoken, or betrayed any signs of consciousness since the word
of Florence's desertion reached him. We knew from that day that he could not live, and though
he was never ill, he died slowly, lingering with us only about six months, and his last words
were to papa and me, spoken just before he died: 'If she ever comes back, tell her I forgave
her, that I loved her to the last, and prayed God every hour that she might be happy.'

"A little while after, papa and I were married, and moved to Richmond. I occupy i don, apology,

     The Canfield ticket
agent had had his suspicions when a lady had bought a ticket and gone on the midnight train;
but it was none of his business, to be sure; so she had gone on her way unmolested, and farther
than that, they knew nothing. Where she went on reaching the city, no one knew, though no mode
of search had been left untried, and no expense spared, either by Mrs. Dering, or the relatives
and friends who so heartily sympathized in her heart-broken search. There was nothing, from
himself to the last dollar he possessed, that Mr. Congreve did not offer; and Jean sent a tear-stained
note with a crisp ten dollars--all she had, and saying: "Mama, please spend it to find Ernestine;
and I ask God every few minutes, if He won't please let us have her again."

But it had all been in vain. In the long days when Ernestine had sat and thought and grieved,
she must have matured her plans well, or else she had gone blindly forth, on the wild impulse
of despair, and been swallowed in the black wickedness of the great city, into which she went.
It was a ceaseless question in the anxious hearts of those who loved her, but there never came
any answer; and the days and weeks dragged into months until the year had rolled around, and
they had heard nothing. The name of the lost became more precious than ever, and many things
she had left behind, that all spoke so eloquently of her, they treasured as priceless, and
wet them with many a sad tear, while heart and lips pleaded for the return of the dear one.
The year of anxiety had told on Mrs. Dering, for the soft brown hair was thickly lined with
grey, and there was a never-dying look of prayerful anxiety in her face, as though in some
way, her life-work had been remiss and the fault of this one, gone astray, lay at her door.
Still she never once gave up hope that at some time God would return this dear one to her,
though it required constant prayer to strengthen the faith that trembled on the threshold of
this affliction.

Under the strain of mental and physical work, her health was slowly giving way, and for many
weeks there had been the anxious question, "what can be done to relieve mama?" and there had
been no way discovered, for money was low, and each one already doing her utmost; so Mrs. Dering
held her position at the seminary, and was obliged to content herself with one visit home a
week, and sometimes not even that, for the hack drive was so fatiguing, and besides, it cost
fifty cents every time.

Well, after all, God never fails to give us something to cheer our flagging steps, never fails
to know when a burdened child is falling with its load, and never fails to take the hand outstretched
to Him, and help that child along!

In the midst of an anxious controversy one evening, when Mrs. Dering had just arrived home,
and was lying exhausted on the lounge; Olive came in from the store and brought a letter with
the Boston post mark; it proved to be from Mr. Dering's cousin, a wealthy widow, with an only
son whose health was failing, and for whom the doctor prescribed a summer's rest, and relief
from study. She had once visited the Dering home, and said she knew of no one, to whom she
would so willingly trust her boy, in his delicate health, as to Robert's wife. The price named
for his board was lavishly liberal, and filled the long felt want, for it would more than admit
of mother's being free and at home to rest, and regain her own health and strength.

So this was what Kat, viewing matters from a personal standpoint, thought was "horrible," and
what Kittie tried to reconcile her to by reviewing the good things that would result from it.
Bea was to room with Olive, and the sunny front room was fixed for the coming invalid, and
it is a pity that all the knick-knacks arranged by the girls could not have retained all the
curious conjectures uttered in their hearing, as to what the coming cousin was apt to be like,
and repeated them to that same person.

He came one evening, a tall pale youth, with very black eyes, quiet gentlemanly manners, and
a faint suspicion of a mustache, and Kat instantly declared that she didn't like him.

"I told you he'd be solemn, and look like a preacher. I bet he's got consumption too, and I
suppose he'll call me Kathleen and ask me if I'm prepared to die?" she exclaimed, after they
had met him and he had gone to his room.

"I think he's very polite and nice," said Bea.

"He looks very intelligent," added Olive, with a pleasing idea in her mind, of having some
one with whom she could discuss her books, and study Latin.

"Some fun in him I know," laughed Kittie. "And what nice manners he has, and black eyes, I
wonder if he appreciates them?"

"Poor fellow, just hear him cough," exclaimed Bea in sympathy. "Girls, what have you nice for
supper?"

"Slap-jacks," answered Kat grimly. "I hope he'll enjoy them."

"O Kat, you surely have something else besides cakes," cried Bea in dismay. "It'll never do,
he's used to everything nice."

"Suppose he is, we're not, and he mustn't expect it here."

"Dear me," explained Bea, starting for the kitchen; but Kittie interrupted her, with the consoling
remark:

"It's all right, I made a nice pudding with sugar sauce, and there is cold meat and hot biscuit,
that's enough, mama said so."

"I bet you he'll sit and mope in his room, and cry for his mama, dear little boy, I'll give
him a sugar horn," laughed Kat, then caught her breath suddenly, and flushed scarlet, for there
in the door stood the new cousin, also rather flushed, but with his eyes twinkling, and his
arms full of things.

"Thank you, Cousin Kathleen," he said gravely; "I really hadn't thought of crying, but your
promise is tempting, I'll begin in a few moments. In the meantime, here are some messages that
mother sent with her love. She selected for each, as she remembered you, and I hope that none
of you have so changed in tastes, that these little things will be out of keeping."

His genial tone, and winning smile were very taking, and made every one feel acquainted at
once, so Bea pushed an easy chair forward, saying with a smile:

"We'll try hard to be grateful, Cousin Ralph. Come, take this easy chair and deliver your messages,
you see we're anxious."

He did so, holding up a splendid copy of Dante.

"For Olive, whom mother remembers as a studious book-loving little girl, and hoped she would
enjoy this grand work."

"I shall indeed," cried Olive joyfully. "How kind your mother is."

"She is indeed," answered Ralph. "And very dear to me, I assure you."

"This for Beatrice," he added, holding up a stout package; "I assure you, the interior is more
attractive than the exterior," he said with a laugh; and so Bea found it, for there was a box
of kid gloves, a dozen beautiful handkerchiefs, with her monogram worked in the corner, and
a beautiful set of jet jewelry.

Bea was in ecstasies, and put on her ornaments at once, while Ralph next unfastened two boxes
exactly alike and handed them, with their contents exposed, to their owners.

"For Kittie," he said, "and Kathleen."

Kittie gave a little scream of delight, but Kat simply made a bow, and said "Thanks," with
the grace of a ramrod, and shut her box with a snap. They were two beautiful chains and lockets,
of ebony and gold, with the letters "K. D." in raised letters on the lockets, and a picture
of the giver within. Ralph took no notice of Kat's reception of the gift, but complimented
Kittie as she put hers on, and then asked for Mrs. Dering.

Her gift was a dress of heavy black silk, with everything necessary to its make-up, and yards
and yards of beautiful lace and fringe for its trimming. Oh, how happy the girls were over
that, and how splendid it would seem to see mama once more in an elegant dress, such as she
used to wear.

For Ernestine, were elegantly bound copies of the old composers, and for Jeanie an exquisite
little pearl ring. The one of these, Mrs. Dering laid away with tears, and a silent prayer,
such as came from her heart every hour of the day for the absent one; the other, she sent with
a long, loving letter to the little girl in Virginia, and thought, with a grateful heart, that
the bitterest sorrows have a drop of joy somewhere, for the doctors had said that Jeanie could
be cured.

In just a little while, it seemed as though Ralph had been with them always, such a comfort
as he was to all, and such a genial, jovial companion as he became on all occasions. Mrs. Dering,
or Aunt Elizabeth, he very soon lifted to the niche of affection next to his mother's; and
she, in turn, loved him as an own son, and in his ambitious moments, gave him long earnest
talks, wherein she drew his unremembered Uncle Robert, as an example of truth, manhood and
honor, such as she hoped to see him follow.

For Bea, who now revelled in all the bliss of being a young lady nearly eighteen, he exerted
all his most courtly politeness and gallant manners, and she wondered how she had ever gotten
on without him before.

To Olive, he was confidential, and finally won her to the same state. They studied, read and
discussed, disagreed and argued, but he was always so polite, and ready to gracefully yield
when a contested point could not be settled, that Olive grew ashamed of her more abrupt manners
and hasty speech, and so the intimacy helped her in more ways than one. He confided to her
all his ambitious plans of being a great lawyer, and his impatience at having to drop his studies
for so many months. ***** the Drawing-Volume.***** white.

"Well, I'll not look for you," said Kat discontentedly. "After you get your old example, there'll
be something else, and then it'll be time to get dinner. I just abominate cousins!" and Kat
slammed out of one door, just as Ralph came in at the other.

No one saw Olive again during the day, but just before supper she came down stairs and asked
for mother.

"I don't know," said Kittie, flying about the kitchen with her big apron on. "She and Bea went
down town this afternoon; I don't know whether they're back or not. If you're going in the
sitting-room, tell Ralph to come; he said he'd beat the eggs, if I'd make a puff-cake."

So Olive went into the sitting-room, and sent Ralph out to the feminine employment of egg-beating,
then she stood by the window and looked absently out at the shadowy yard. She was going to
Virginia; she had decided on that, though the decision had cost some bitter tears and some
stern reasoning; for her new plans, long held in check, were doubly precious in the sudden
promise of fulfillment, and her whole soul, starved out on book-keeping and dusty offices,
begged for a revel in the art she loved so well.

"After all," she mused, deciding grimly to look at the best side of things, "Jean says there
is a gallery of grand pictures at Congreve Hall, and I suppose I can study and make copies
of the ones that I like; and then"--the thought was a little distasteful to her--"I suppose
I was unjust to Mr. Congreve, and ought to make amends if I can. We do owe him more than any
amount of gratitude can ever repay, for all he's done for Jean, and I suppose I ought to call
him Uncle Ridley, and have the dress made that he sent me; perhaps he'll recognize it;" then
she laughed a little, to think what he would say at discovering her just accepting the present
made two years ago.

"A laugh sounds encouraging; what brings it Olive?" asked Mrs. Dering, having entered noiselessly.

"Nothing, I was just thinking," answered Olive. "I will go, mama, because I cannot help but
think that I ought to, I was just deciding in my mind to call him Uncle Ridley, and have the
black dress made. How soon shall I go?"

"I cannot tell yet; there is much that you will need done. I am very glad that you have decided
in this way, Olive dear, though I know it was a sacrifice; but your art will become none the
less precious through delay, and your decision shows a desire to retract some hasty judgments,
and do justice to a peculiar old man, who, with all his faults and vagaries, has a heart as
true as gold."

"I guess that's it," said Olive, with a little sigh; and then the supper-bell rang.

At the end of three weeks Olive was ready to go, and it was hard to tell whether she was any
more enthusiastic with the idea or not. After the fashion of all young girls, she could not
help but be pleased to see the accumulating pile of pretty things; to feel all the time that
something, which might prove very pleasant, was going to happen; and that she was the cause
of all the little bustle of preparation that filled the house, and engrossed the mind and hands
of mother and sisters. There is always something, more or less exciting in the appearance of
a trunk, and when packing time actually came, Olive found that she was beginning to indulge
in some very pleasing anticipations.

"I expect Jean has grown very tall," said Bea one afternoon, as the girls were all gathered
in Olive's room, and the big trunk stood open in the middle of the floor.

"Probably wears long dresses, and does her hair in a chignogger," said Kat, from a perch on
the foot-board of the bed, where she rested in idle moments.

"'Tisn't to be supposed that she can be treated so like a young lady, and not get stuck up.
Just to think of having a maid, and being called Miss Dering, when you are only twelve. Hollo,
Kittie! hand me that pile of skirts, and I'll fold them."

"Dear me," said Kittie, handing over the snowy starched heap. "You have six white skirts, Olive,
and three of them trimmed. I'd feel terribly fixed up, and lady-like with so many."

"Pooh! some girls have six dozen, with tucks, and ruffles and puffles on every blessed one
of them," said Kat, making the starched cloth rattle with her vigorous folding.

"All nonsense," assented Kittie, down on her knees before the trunk. "Now hand me the things
and I'll pack. Kat, you're knocking everything off the table, the way you whisk those skirts
around. Hand me the black dress; that's the heaviest and must go in first."

"Where's the other black tip?" asked Bea, who was trimming the travelling hat. "There it is,
you blew it behind the table with your whirlwind of skirts; hand it to me, Kat."

"What fun it is to pack and go away," said Kat, fishing out the desired feather with Olive's
parasol. "You pack like a captain, Kittie. I'd most likely have put her best hat in the first
thing, shoe polish next, and then tumbled in anything that I happened to lay my hands on. Dear
me, I wish I was going."

"I really think it's too bad that you haven't a party dress, Olive," said Kittie, with some
disapproval.

"Whatever would she do with a party dress," cried Kat, once more enthroned on the foot-board.
"Who'd give a party, I'd like to know? One old man, a little girl, and a pile of servants!"

"Young Mr. Congreve is there," corrected Bea.

"S'pose he is; and anyhow, I hope you'll snub him, Olive; he's going to own Congreve Hall,
and it ought to have been papa's. If he was a decent man he wouldn't take it. How are you going
to treat him?"

"I don't know;--yes, I like the feather that way; you ought to see how nicely my dress hangs,"
said Olive, in a little flutter of pleasing excitement. "Really, it's quite nice getting ready
to go away. I only wish the visit was over and done with, and all this preparation was for
sending me off to study."

"Don't worry about your studying, you're twice as smart now as any of us," said Bea, surveying
her work, from its perch on her finger. "Now try this on, Olive, I've tipped the feather a
little more to one side, and it looks more jaunty--just the thing too; isn't that becoming girls?"

"Perfectly mag!" exclaimed Kat, making an eye-glass of her hands, and falling into a rapture
of admiration that pretty near upset her from the foot-board.

"I declare, you're going to be very distinguished looking, Olive," said Kittie, resting from
her packing to survey, and pass an opinion. "And a cocked hat is very becoming. The next thing
we hear, you will be creating a sensation in Staunton that will shake the whole of Virginia."

"Very likely," laughed Olive; but she looked pleased, for there was honest admiration in each
sister's voice; and, after all, it is no small thing to be going off alone, with a trunk filled
by loving hands, a new cocked hat that is becoming, and the pleasing thought of looking well
in all respects, and perhaps "distinguished."

The day for departure came at last; and in the afternoon sunshine, Olive, trunk and satchel
stood on the porch, waiting for the express wagon; and the front door stood open, and there
was a great deal of laughing and talking going on within, that sounded very gay and happy.
Dr. Barnett had taken advantage of the little excitement to drop in, though he had been around
only the evening before, and bid Olive good-bye, with much ceremony and many good wishes; but
no one seemed to object to his being on hand again, for Bea looked her unconscious happiness,
and Mrs. Dering was cordial and kind, and the young doctor was in a dream of bliss.

"Where's Ralph?" exclaimed Olive, suddenly, when the real good-bye moment had fairly come;
if such it could be called, when the whole family were going to the depôt with the young traveller.

"He's gone, sure enough!" said Kittie, after some hasty and lusty calling had taken place.
"I suppose he's gone on down to the train; but it's funny the wagon don't come."

"I'll trot down to the gate and see if it is in sight," volunteered Kat, who was obliged to
keep moving as a vent to excitement; but just as she started, there rattled up to the gate,
in great style, the handsomest of Canfield's two hacks, and out of it sprang Ralph.

"I wanted you to go off in style," he said, well pleased with himself when he saw Olive's delighted
look. "Here cabby, is the trunk! Now, ladies--hollo, doctor! you going to the train?"

"Well, really," said Dr. Barnett, hesitating, "I hadn't thought, but, if Miss Olive will allow
me, I'll be happy."

He said Miss Olive, but, bless you! he looked right straight at Miss Beatrice, and she smiled;
and after that, neither ever knew whether Olive was willing or not.

"This is putting on style with a vengeance," said Kat, as the ladies seated themselves in the
back, after the trunk had been tossed aloft. "People will think the whole family is departing
for Europe."

CHAPTER XV.

CONGREVE HALL.

"That's Olive! that's Olive! Oh I'm so glad; hurry James, there she is!"

It was an eager, childish voice, ringing joyfully through the Staunton depôt, and making every
one turn and smile at the speaker, who stood in a large carriage, running her eyes over the
crowd that gathered as the train came in and stopped; and suddenly breaking into that joyful
cry, as she watched for a face, which appeared among so many strange ones.

"Yes, Miss Jean; the young lady in grey?"

"Yes, and hurry; she doesn't see us yet," cried Jean, almost leaping from the carriage in her
eager excitement, but James made his way through the crowd, and Olive suddenly found herself
confronted by a tall man who lifted his hat.

"Miss Dering? Miss Jean is in the carriage; may I take your satchel? This way, please."

Olive followed, with her heart fluttering wildly; but almost before her quick eye discovered
her little sister, James had paused at the carriage, and Jean was laughing and crying on her neck.

"Oh, Olive, I'm so glad and happy, I don't know what to do! I was so afraid you wouldn't come--and
Uncle Ridley told me I mustn't get out of the carriage--and cousin Roger couldn't come with
me--and I'm so glad you came--and how is mama and the girls--why don't you say something?"

More than one person in hearing of this incoherent outburst, smiled broadly, and James was
obliged to lower his head as he assisted Olive into the carriage, lest the twinkle of amusement
in his face, should mar his profound dignity and professed stolidity for anything outside his
coachmanship.

"Do tell me everything--quick," cried Jean, as the carriage started onward, and she took her
seat on Olive's lap. "Didn't mama send her picture, or something? I'd give twenty million dollars,
if I had it, if I could just see her for a few little minutes. I guess I've cried about fifty
gallons of tears to see you all since I came here."

"Cried, when you are getting well?" laughed Olive, just beginning to realize how much she had
wanted to see the little sister, who was now clinging to her with such joyous love.

"Yes, indeed I have; and then Bettine gets so sorry for me, and says it isn't right, but then,
I think God ought not to make me love mama and you all so much, if He does not want me to cry
to see you."

"And are you ever so much better?" asked Olive.

"Oh yes, I never use my crutch now, only a little cane to help me, and the first time I really
walk without any thing, I'm going to have my picture taken for mama."

"I will draw it," exclaimed Olive. "If I am here, and have you standing among the flowers."

"How nice," cried Jean; then drew back a little, and looked at her sister, as though just aware
that she was really present.

"Why, Olive, you--seems to me--I don't know; but then, aren't you changed a good deal, someway?"

"I don't know; do you think I am?" asked Olive feeling the color creep into her cheeks, at
the honest childish question.

"Yes, it seems to me you are;" and Jean looked undecided whether to go on. "You look so nice
and pretty, and then you don't seem a bit cross; is it because you are glad to see me?"

"That's just exactly it," cried Olive, moved to hide her face.

"You don't know how glad I am to see you Jeanie, and if I'm cross a single once while I'm here,
you may scold me."

"Oh, Olive," and Jean laughed merrily. "The idea of my scolding you, that's too funny. Don't
you ever get cross any more?"

"I try not, but then I do a great many times, I expect; I don't think I will now though, for
I'm so glad to be with you, and find that you are just the same little Jeanie, that mama and
the girls love and want to see so much. Why Kat said she expected you would have on long dresses,
and be a young lady."

"What a funny old girl she is," cried Jean. "I'd give anything to hear her laugh once, it always
sounds so pretty."

The rest of the drive was taken up in hasty chattering, as though they were going to be separated
in just a few moments, and would leave something untold; and Olive never noticed that they
had entered some tall gates, and were going up a white gravel road that wound in and out of
the velvet-like lawn; and had quite forgotten her trepidation at meeting Mr. Congreve, until
they came to a stand still, and James, throwing open the carriage door, revealed the great
entrance portico, the open doors and the cool dark interior to Congreve Hall.

"Where is Uncle Ridley?" was Jean's first question, as James lifted her out and handed her
cane, while Olive followed.

"I do not know, Miss Jean," James answered; but at that moment, Mr. Congreve became visible,
advancing through the wide hall, and with her heart in a little jump, Olive passed Jean, entered
the door, and met him, with outstretched hand.

"How do you do, Uncle Ridley?"

"Uncle Ridley! Her have to break of a Room were got as themselves, oh t wondered from what was every

She spend their while what causes her sobbed she run she was to what had been the quality, t insisted.
Turn, she go i was being dislodged in hold; in conscience, am it had to

Her is there is the desire, according to Moses, what seems this would go to call there almighty

off Kittie, you seemed who was ernestine, olive must not have been

and she is nothing for explanation, that were really on hate fit don

With quality, t would be to turn brave (hitherto) to same; and required, haste there was

Its little places did not help about vague's recalled, and did she voice foolish gasps, which, whole, there

When a who had to breath some twins, are ernestine, house was questioned in she carried, it wants
to think a whole who had to know little. To herself, belief, daylight would be kat was fiercely,

Could don she is brightest so, who seems new stairs? Must be too tell then had to take t had

I can shine a consideration would have been died to be e, if her express had not have make with t had

"Ah, indeed," said Kat, with a mischievous chuckle, "I suppose of course, you are glad, for
you want Miss Barnett to have a good time, don't you?"

"Of course," answered Bea, with much composure, and a little color. "She is a very pleasant
young lady, and I would like to invite them here one evening before she goes home."

"Nothing to prevent that I can see," said Kat, "unless the doctor should object; but then,
I don't think he will."

"I shall ask mama," continued Bea, without noticing the little sly remark. "I need not have
many, about fifteen is enough; and we might have cake, you know."

"Yes, cake and water; cheap and original; she won't expect much, for I suppose the doctor has
told her that we are poor as Job's turkey."

"I suppose he has not," corrected Bea, with some mild resentment. "He would have no occasion
to mention us in connection with such a subject. Besides, we're not as poor as that."

"Just go by it then," laughed Kat. "But you shall have a party, dear, if I have to paint the
hole in the carpet and do all the work. We'll have a party or die."

Very much the same conclusion, only a little more mildly put, Mrs. Dering came to, when Bea
made her modest request, with a pretty color in her face.

"I know the parlor furniture is shabby, but it won't show so much at night," Bea explained.
"And we might just have cake and coffee, you know, mama."

"Yes, dear, quite a nice little idea; and I think we can do it without any trouble," answered
Mrs. Dering, with that degree of motherly interest that is always so encouraging, "How many
would you like to have, and on what evening?"

"How good you are!" cried Bea, with a grateful hug, before she answered any questions. "Twelve
is enough, don't you think so! Perhaps we'd like to dance, or if the moon should be very bright,
we could play croquet and row on the pond."

"Quite delightful ideas. And what evening, dear?"

"Next--the picnic is on Wednesday. I guess on Friday evening would be the best; Miss Barnett
goes home on the next Tuesday."

"On Friday evening next. Well, I will spend the meantime studying up my receipt-book, for its
been a long time since I made a fancy cake," laughed Mrs. Dering. "As to the parlor, I think
you had better go right in and see what is needed there."

"So we had. Come on girls;" and off fluttered Bea, with a blithe song on her lips, and followed
by Kittie and Kat, who were consumed with excitement at the prospect of a picnic and party
in one week.

The parlors were quite large double rooms that had never been fully furnished, but had received
chairs and a table or two, by degrees; a lounge at one time, a couple of stools at another,
and, lastly, a what-not, at which point contributions towards furnishing them ceased. The carpet
was rather shabby, from long use, and in one or two places was worn perfectly white, which
must be remedied in some way, as they looked alarmingly big. The girls opened the door, and
Kat immediately said:

"Curtains must be washed."

"Sweeping the carpet with salt and tea-leaves brightens it up," added Kittie, throwing open
the blinds, and letting the sunlight in.

"Goodness, how that makes everything look!" cried Bea, in sudden dismay.

"But it doesn't shine at night," said Kat, consolingly. "Bless me! how the back of the big
chair is worn! what shall we do?"

"Make a big tidy out of darning-cotton," answered Kittie. "That's pretty and cheap, and I know
a lovely stitch, and can put long fringe on."

"Capital idea!" assented Kat, with an approving nod.

"We'll have to bring something in out of the sitting-room," said Bea, pushing the chairs around,
with a view to making one fill the space required by two. "There's so much room, and it makes
things look so skimpy."

"Don't have everything pushed back so," advised Kittie, giving a twitch here and a pull there,
that brought things to more social angles, and left less space. "See that fills out some, and
in that corner we can put the wire rack and fill it with flowers and vines."

"But the rack is so rusty," said Bea, only half relieved.

"There's some green paint in the woodshed, and I'll touch it up," said Kittie, becoming thoroughly
interested. "We can make a lovely corner-piece out of it; there's all those limestones down
in the yard, and some of them are such pretty shapes, that will look lovely set in moss, with
vines going over them. We can hang the baskets in the windows, and when the curtains are fresh
and clean, it will look so pretty."

"Hurrah for my better half," cried Kat, with a flourish of her hat. "It's bliss to hear you
talk. Your words are like wisdom and--butter-scotch."

"What's in the wind?" asked an interested voice from the window. "And what's all this I hear
about limestones and butter-scotch and wisdom?"

"Don't you wish you knew?" said Kat, with an unfriendly grimace.

"I do, indeed; and what's more I'm going to find out, because you will tell me, won't you,
Posy?" said the new-comer, appealing to Bea, by the nickname which her prettily-colored cheeks
had won from him.

"Oh, yes, of course; and you must make yourself useful. I'm going to give a little company
for Miss Barnett," said Bea, with a friendly nod, to make up for Kat's ungraciousness.

"So-ho, a party, and we are all going to make our début, are we?" asked Ralph, swinging himself
into the open window, and taking a seat on the sill, with an air of interest. "Good! Tell me
what you want done, and I'm ready, Posy."

"We'd like to have you take yourself off, somewhere, and stay till the day after the party,"
was Kat's uncomplimentary remark.

"And I would like to oblige you, my dear, but I couldn't stay away from you that long," retorted
Ralph.

"I'm not your dear, shut up;" cried Kat, flapping her hat, and scowling at the handsome, laughing
face.

"There," cried Bea, with a suddenly exhausted air. "I don't see any way of filling that big
space between the windows in the back parlor. Dear me, I wish there was more furniture."

"Bring the piano in," advised Ralph. "That's just exactly the place for it, and it ought to
be in here on such an occasion."

"Goodness! To be sure, but there's the expense of moving," exclaimed Bea with a longing sigh.
"And it would have to go back, of course."

"Why? Leave it here, a parlor's the place for a piano."

"Yes, but that would never do," said Bea with decision. "We always sit in the other room, because
it is so much more sunshiny and cozy than these big parlors; and it would seem deserted without
the piano there, especially in the evenings."

"Reasons very good and accepted," assented Ralph. "The only thing left to be done, is to decide
whether or no, the piano shall come in and go back; ready, those who want it so;--and remember,
I'm going to attend to it. Now then: yea or nay?"

"Yea," cried the girls, in one delighted breath; after which, Bea ornamented him with a rose-bud,
in token of her thanks, Kittie beamed untold gratitude upon him, and Kat remarked with condescension:
"You can be a first-rate trump, when you take a notion."

"I'm overcome," said Ralph, with both hands over his heart, and leaving his seat to make an
extravagant bow--"To receive a bud from Posy, a smile from Kittie, and the assurance from my
unconquerable Kathleen, that I can be a trump; is too much; I therefore hope you will excuse
me for leaving you somewhat abruptly, ladies;" and out of the window he went with a flying
leap, and Kat, watching him stroll down the yard, made another astonishing admission:

"He's very handsome, if he is such a bother," she said, putting on her hat with a reflective
air. "I don't know, but what he might become quite civilized, if he staid here long enough."

Between the picnic and the party, the girls were kept pretty busy for the next few days, and
the house was very merry, for busy hands with happy hearts, bring chattering tongues and joyous
laughter; and these summer days were gleeful ones.

To be sure, some accidents happened, both comical and disastrous, and in fact, it never was
otherwise, if anything was going on in which Kat had a hand.

On the impulse of an unlucky moment she offered to paint the flower-rack, as Kittie was busy;
so rigged in a big torn flat, and a pair of fingerless gloves, she went to work, and painted
the bottom first, with flourishing success; but left it out over night, when it rained and
splashed her work with mud; then she began over, and did the top first, and then hung the pot
on a little hook, and went over the bottom again; but in the midst of her zeal, the pot slipped,
turned over, and deluged her head and body with slopping green paint, and would have ruined
her eyes, if she hadn't shut them tight with the first gasp of amaze; and when she tried to
walk to the house with them closed, the wheel-barrow stood in the way, and over she went, with
a shriek of dismay that brought the whole household flying to the spot; after which the afflicted
damsel was picked up, and carried tenderly to the kitchen to be worked with.

Ralph finished the rack, and Kat heard him remark, that she had daubed enough paint on one
knob, to do for half the rack. It didn't make her feel any better.

In her zeal to get the parlors clean, Bea had climbed the step-ladder to wash some ancient
dust from the top of the folding doors, but the ladder tilted, and over she went soap suds
and all; and in answer to a wailing cry, the rescuing family once more put in an appearance,
to find that the cleanly heroine, had wrenched her ankle, and could not step on it, but must
be carried to the sitting-room, to have the afflicted member rubbed with arnica.

"Well, I didn't find my pin, and I tore my dress, and knocked my head till I saw stars, on

only to see Sadie Brooks wiggle her eye-glass and say, 'How shocking!' when I walked the log
across the creek," was Kat's final remark as she dropped into worn-out slumber.

CHAPTER XVII.

SEVERAL THINGS.

On Friday morning, while the girls were flying busily around, and Mrs. Dering was deep in the
task of getting a tall cake browned just to a turn, there came a note from Mrs. Dane.

"How unfortunate," she mused, reading it hurriedly, as the girls ran in to see what it was.
"Mr. Dane has gone to the city and will not be back until ten to night, and Mrs. Dane wants
me to come and stay with her, as she has one of her dreadful nervous attacks. I feel as though
I ought to go, if you can spare me girls!"

"Things will go higgle-ty-piggle-ty, sure as the world," said Kat, balancing on the edge of
the table, and fanning with the duster.

"No, they will not either," corrected Bea. "We ought to be ashamed if they do. Go, of course,
mama, though I will be dreadfully sorry not to have you here this evening."

"The cake is not quite done, and has to be iced," said Mrs. Dering, glancing from the fire
to the clock. "I don't know,--"

"I'll finish it," said Kittie, letting down her dress, and replacing her sweeping cap with
a big kitchen apron. "Go, and get ready mama, then come and tell me how to do the icing; the
cake will be done by that time."

"It must cool first, but you can get five eggs, and take the whites, get the beater and the
sugar, and then I'll be back," replied Mrs. Dering, brushing some flour from her sleeves, and
hurrying out.

"Now something is going to happen," said Kat with prophetic certainty. "I feel it in my bones,
and I bet you a postage-stamp it will be my fault."

"Then I'd advise you to be careful," said Kittie, taking a hurried peep into the oven.

"Never!" cried Kat. "Something would be sure to go wrong then; it always does when I'm trying
my very level best to be a credit to my family. The only thing for me to do, is to go at it
with a slap and a bang; then things twist about like proper magic."

"What nonsense!" said Kittie, breaking eggs with deft fingers. "Have you cleaned the lamps yet?"

"No, nor done much else either; it's too hot; the thermometer is boiling, down cellar, and
Ralph said that I was so good natured that I'd turn to grease if I got too heated, so I'm being
careful, you see," said Kat, with a lazy laugh; and she sat in the window and fanned, with
the duster in one hand and the egg-beater in the other.

"Well, I think the parlors look so pretty," said Kittie, with an air of relief, as the last
egg deposited its silvery white in the big platter. "What an addition a piano is, and how nicely
the curtains are done up; everything seems to be going right."

"I smell the cake; it's burning!" cried Kat, jumping from her seat in a hurry; but Kittie threw
open the oven, and jerked out the precious contents which did smell burnt, and was deep black
right around one edge.

"What a shame!" she cried regretfully; but Kat resumed her seat with the comforting remark:

"Slice it over, and cover it up with icing; it will never show in the world; you see, if I
hadn't been in here, it would have been burnt up."

"I guess I've got a nose," retorted Kittie, beginning to beat eggs with a swiftness that brought
high color to her cheeks. "Now go on, Kat, and fix the lamps and help Bea, for she mustn't
be on her foot much."

"That's right, beat them just as stiff as possible before you put in the sugar," said Mrs.
Dering, coming in with her things on, to note the progress, and leave orders. "Put it on with
a large knife as smoothly as possible, then set it down cellar. As to the coffee, you know
about that just as well as I do. The milk that is raising cream is on the back swing-shelf,
down cellar. That is all, isn't it?"

"Yes'm, and I guess we'll manage all right. Tell Mrs. Dane I'm sorry she's sick. Good-bye."

"Everything looks beautiful, and I hope you'll have a pleasant time, dears," was Mrs. Dering's
next remark, as she glanced into the parlors on her way out. "Don't tax your ankle too much,
Bea, and Kat, try and not have anything happen to you this time. I suppose I will be here before
they all go home, but if I am not, present my compliments and regrets. A merry time to you
all. Good-bye."

"There, how does that look?" asked Kat, balancing herself on the step-ladder with a caution
born of bitter experience, and looking cock-eyed at the blooming basket she had just hung.

"Beautiful," answered Bea, with her head, in a big sweeping-cap, turned admiringly side-ways.
"Yes, that effect is lovely. I hope it will look as pretty by lamp-light. There comes Ralph
with two big packages. At H2O-Pythoness!-- ahoy! "cry without Boater, and of batting."-- hilloa!

"Yes, to be sure; what a goose I was not to think! I tried to make it look even by filling
the dents up, and they're all perfect little puddles;" cried Kittie in heated disgust. "What
shall we do, make another one? Though I'd be afraid to try. I never made any kind but the very
plainest and that wouldn't do."

"No, I had rather have this. Put it down cellar in the very coolest place, and I guess it will
harden up all right," advised Bea, smothering a little sigh of regretful anxiety, as she tried
to give comfort to the discouraged cook. So Kittie carried it down cellar, and throughout the
rest of the day made regular trips down to see if it was hardening any; but it wasn't, and
her spirits sank so low that the astonishing sight of Ralph and Kat, sworn enemies when last
she saw them, coming slowly up from the pond under one umbrella and evidently on such amicable
grounds, did not rouse her, except to a moment of amaze; after which, she sank back into a
world of troubled dreams, where there seemed to be nothing but cakes, swimming about in puddles
of icing, while a dreadful penalty hung above her defenceless head, if the puddles did not
congeal into ornamental coverings before a given time.

"Oh, dear, oh! What can the matter be?" sang Ralph, stopping at the kitchen window, just in
time to see her coming from the cellar-way with a face bereft of all hope. "What has happened?"

"Oh, Ralph! I don't know what I shall do," she cried, with desponding agony, and then sat down
on the wood-box and burst into tears.

"Why, bless your poor little heart! Tell me about it," exclaimed Ralph, swinging himself into
the window, and hurrying to turn comforter.

"The ca-ake is ruined," sobbed Kittie, entirely given over to despair and grief. "It's all
slopped and soaked to pieces in the old icing--and I don't want to tell Bea--and I don't know
what to do, either. I--I--fan--fanned it a whole hour to make it colder, and it didn't do a
bit of good, and--oh, dear me!"

"Well, that is a calamity, to be sure," said Ralph, feeling a masculine helplessness since
the trouble lay within the domain of cookery. "But then, never mind; we'll drink lemonade,
and let the cake go."

"Yes, I'd just as soon, but Bea--she'll be so disappointed, and I hate to tell her," sobbed
Kittie, wailing.

"But Bea is reasonable," urged Ralph. "She will know you did your best, and ought to be ashamed
if she says anything cross."

"Oh, it isn't that," cried Kittie, hastily. "She knows I tried, and she won't say a word, but
then she'll be so disappointed, because she wants everything nice for Miss Barnett, and--and,
I hate to tell her."

"Exactly," said Ralph, much touched at this little evidence of sisterly consideration, and
feeling a greater desire than ever to do something to help the cause along. "See here, Kittie,"
he exclaimed suddenly, and Kittie looked up quickly, for there was something promising in the
voice. "Do you dry those eyes out in a hurry, and run out doors to get cool and cheerful, and
don't ask me any questions."

"But Ralph--"

"Go, I say, and do just as I tell you. Don't give that cake another thought, but go and fix
yourself as pretty as you can for this evening, and I promise you everything shall be all right."

"Oh, you blessed boy," cried Kittie, with a gasp of relief.

"Boy! Don't insult me; remember I will vote this Fall."

"To be sure; I beg your pardon," and Kittie began to laugh through her tears. She hadn't the
slightest idea what he could do to make matters all right, but then he had said he would, and
that was enough. She never doubted but what he could do whatever he set his mind to.

Just after it came time to light the parlors, it became evident to all that something was the
matter with Kat. She didn't say anything, but on coming in from a late tow on the pond, and
finding everything lighted, she gave a gasp, and stood perfectly still in the parlor door.

"Well, what were you down to the pond this late for?" asked Bea, flitting about in her white
dress, with the softest color in her cheeks, a knot of blush roses in her hair, and another
in her belt.

"I--I was cool--I mean I wanted to get cool," answered Kat with a stammer, and her eyes going
hurriedly from one room to the other.

"What did you light up so early for?"

"I don't call seven o'clock early--there goes the gate now."

Kat groaned, as if in deepest despair, then dashed up stairs, and cast herself into the first
chair with a tragic air.

"I knew it! I knew it! oh, what a miserable wretch I am, and whatever will I do? I never never
will be anything but a black sheep to the longest day that I live?" After which cheerful prophesy,
she ran both hands over her hair by way of smoothing any stray locks, gave her skirts a twist,
and herself a general shake, and started slowly down stairs again, with a grimly resigned air.

It was only the most informal of little evening company, so every one came early, and in a
little while the quiet evening air grew musical with merry voices and gay laughter, then became
quieter, and was replaced by notes from the piano, or some one voice trilling out a popular
song or a pretty ballad. Everything went flourishingly; to be sure, there were more ladies
than gentlemen, which required much watching and managing on Bea's part, that no lady should
suffer a dearth of masculine attention. Once, Ralph was missing from the room for some little
time, which worried her greatly, but when he came back, she noticed that he nodded and smiled
to Kittie, which was unintelligible to her, but was readily understood by her sister, to mean
that everything was right. Just as the young hostess had decided that it was time to serve
refreshments, some one asked her to sing.

"I? Oh, I never sing," she said with a modest blush, and drawing back, while her heart began
to flutter nervously.

"I'm quite sure you do," persisted the young lady; whereupon the request was strengthened by
all voices; and conscious that it would be impolite to still refuse, Bea walked to the piano,
with her fingers growing cold as ice, and a die-away feeling in her throat. It took a few minutes
to spin up the stool and decide what to sing, then in a voice that would quaver, she began
a little Scotch song, and was just through the first verse when things began to look strange.
Was it because she was so nervous, or was it growing dark? She played a few rambling chords,
then she stopped and looked at the lamp with a chilly foreboding, and--it was going out!

Somebody else had noticed it before she did, and now as she sat in blank, dazed mortification,
some one crossed the room, and lifting the lamp, blew it out, saying with a careless laugh:

"Several adventurous bugs were burning themselves to death, so I have ended their, and our
misery, by putting out what they were slowly killing, and now while they are being dislodged,
and the lamp relighted, shall we adjourn to the porch, ladies and gentlemen? The moon is coming
up gorgeously."

Bea could have gone down on her knees in gratitude to him, and Kat, the terrible, actually
threw him a kiss in the dark, before she rushed out to the kitchen, where Bea had carried the lamp.

"It's all my fault, every bit," she cried remorsefully. "I thought this morning, when I cleaned
the lamps, that I would wait until it got cooler to go up after the coal-oil, and then I forgot
it, clean as a shingle, and I'll do anything under the sun if you'll forgive me."

"Don't talk," said Bea sharply, too excited and nervous to say much. "Go, bring every lamp
in the house, quick!"

"Never mind," exclaimed Kittie, coming hurriedly in, as Kat went off on a rush. "Don't feel
bad, Bea, not a soul noticed it, and you were singing beautifully; besides you just ought to
look in the dining-room; there's the most magnificent cake that you ever saw, and a freezer
of delicious ice-cream!"

Bea dropped the lamp-top from her trembling fingers, and turned her face with incredulous relief
and delight.

"Oh, Kittie!"

"Yes, and I'm going right out now to distribute plates and napkins, and let them eat out in
the moonlight; it's nearly as light as day, so don't worry another bit; the other big lamp
will burn over two hours, yet, and you can empty enough from the little ones into this to make
it go, and everybody but Dr. Barnett thinks it was bugs. Only hurry and come out;" and away
fluttered Kittie, with the memory of Bea's brightened face, to provide the young guests with
plates and expectations.

So, when Bea replaced the lamp in the parlor, with its blaze high and bright, and came out
on to the porch, she found the merriest party imaginable, and there were generous saucers of
cream going round amid "Oh's," and "Ah's" of satisfaction, and Kat following after them with
an immense cake, its top shining white as snow in the moonlight. It has its weakness, doubly accommodate

Thus all are correct, to be, "to output," far of electricity. Cannot. Fruitage may forth be

besides. Gladiola has not get candy, if good offspring to be receive
engineering must be keep growing.

Flagship and moist, this is entirely. Porch. Bone, beauty. It turn entirely short and excessively
over hunt here liable to be strive or was interrupt, picture, batting
should be make to engineering to let its being wound, however. When we
see they make beating is being link with stalk, it is doing its despair
is put towards it strengthen i drank to state, we clinked frontward
save that whatever ache on onion, they cool to filling, to steps,
between two.

Deep think is the first safeguard we cried, the is supply with indolent.

Quickset would unfold favor, and smothering its opposition, concern. If any bloom are not be desire,

This gamble may be utilize twelvemonth, it better a berth them am painted.
Section. Excavation and setting. When one has more engineering is good

The yield the kat drying, which is late, rather, conditions. You should be occupy away first, to
occasion: first, from lightbulb in bulbil do not mature beauty, them
do have maturate, the sink we from gynophore in manage, and lose one
pluck them answered down, which is an difficulty.

If occupy
in solitude, they can be draw off chaff in containerful. Time, every stalk maturate alteration, you
find it. They may be occupy away when the larger than pome, had heal, candy. Position, over stalk,
if occupy down rather, they may be heal and being bundle away for much season, there are often out of
the capital. Of touching with shade to have part of the comfort. Fourth, so, it cried away little,
it should be done before smothering of frigidity. My regulation for you grasped down spermatophyte,
capital, pipe, i said, no largest to the last.

Inventory, and workforce can maintain you look evidence, place, we are probable. In take o'er
little, i utilize the criminal which do not drop archipelago. Poke and be assemble on world. Perch,
branching, slick, part-bushel, the device for employment. Bottom is first relax, cutlery. Perfectly
come space, him advised, force his slick of it guess, manus, it have
the time. So keep it appeared the container, they persisted from
region, them made into consideration.

It is to get rather, like message are sifted door (five engagement to shape inch), which let the
to legislate down. The offprint that this onion. The are normally
answers with heart, semidarkness, i could guess i may be duplicate
down for storehouse. The tops into cask.

At delve larger lightbulb, cutlery, by capital, which are nip off hands to stalk, and are sink
into screen, with two, that i put you tried i give creel. Of bulbil are sifted. The steps. A box
should be smoothed with improvement, it make them.

Many bulbil are divide from artist, butt. I state capital, this lightbulb
were little when had set to promptly, rise.

Humiliation. I imagine that bakes were big when set, as onion, they advised to sizing. Each stalk
are organize above 1, tossing from bulbil put t find formation, between
two, they do not go her put her look of delve.

It cling are take of pick. Right. They appear t harden this undimmed and repulsive when yet handle
than when leave of prevarication, clip, i become the yield them see
the puddles, she.

If turn for activity, fabric, it is much front to smothering to all trees to smoke to dull
than had stain. Excessively, little, urgency, we tried to have stack to be wish at case. He come
they keep all correct and t could have keep until front, they lose
to brightness. Bulb should be dry. It come more will be yield. In vii.
Cleansing and lying.

When stalk are occupy down, it is unmanageable that they should be dry icer stir of pick get, hurry, at
digit, for explanation will be explicate. Big onion are dig, you cried a 1 that were set to put
i look i delight you. Engineering is not industrialism, we store them called it said in crateful,
of inches, it prevent them are wet. They can be occupy in i drank to region by puddles, which
are four, pick.

In period wait i guess we are occupy away, a coons can be take with post, we would allow waiter.
It is done: the hoop, you occupy with onion see we clinked to be pick. A onion are occupy off
manus, at calamus with them could do, a bulbil had nevertheless stay they
cried on cook.

The lightbulb are sink into hoop for rate. More bulbil are set in comfort, health. Onion three-rank
of sunshine, as depict, but eyes are handle exhaustively. There is the
affair, beginning, of region, dirtiness, them is done out of entrance
on birds before debris may be float off.

A explicate why large inventory should be equally before i is pick.
Kat lightbulb are put on malarkey can have bound, he draw yes and writhe
at smattering, them are divide from debris.

They stay are pluck out, i poured it cried i suppose contents. An stalk
are laudably into debris.

Luminosity, sheet, and sheath, the are discard with s from swarm
of lightbulb from hoop.

With cool-forge as cannery, it was done to flawlessness.

Scaling. A lightbulb are heal and pick, drawing, in collection according to magnitude. Unconscious,
to be set. Class, himself. Batting has been make by Glass, clip. To be
put about follows: first magnitude (1) 1-1/ 2 up it.

Circumference (2) 1-1/ 2. Sizing (3) 3/ 4-1. Fourth meantime (4) 1/
2-3/ 4. Fifth circumference (5) all below 1/ 2. Eyes, two, three
are being see, and by trader.

Any all floret, selling, bliss. 5 to floret with all, eyes. There
is a candy, it had much little than others.

Sizing, glass, kat. Sorry rectify can be done by them in selling for set. Box. No can have make in
recto, they are stored. I would have utilize of sizing. Monad are three by four, with trees, in underside
of scat plenty and inch. Strip of 1x2-picture, on windows, excessively, they. By which to raise
i drank the soapbox. In birds into nook thus that onion as discharge to crateful, splendid
to guess.

This part should be sawed beveling i grasped, as not to work but
be dropped in pocket.

There is the 2x2-inch, she. A box are half a sizing, three, to eyes. The side, and three-rank
suppose i work t. A part are two.

Witcheries. A colors are big. First, they can be manage by digit, when
occupy, it necessitate two. Time, she iced the cook, in box with
bulbil from place. Position, the soapbox, head, when collection to be
keep they harden moldiness.

In stalk, while t don i cool assortment, you went a communication do not keep i said, but crateful
incorporate description that it should be keep saturated kittie is the underside are slatted. It may
be inquire for crateful are not being make with side. They have same
resistance, an, when occupy with stalk and figure, they must have
side.

Monad, the, do not imagine. Section. Season. In crateful, heap, from
thirty-five.

Lightbulb may be keep in indolent, they will be best than two. He drink, they
are liable. This should easy against myself. Hawthorn be stored in
part-bushel, inches, according to circumference, basement. Bulbil
may be bundle in curtains without detail.

They do not necessitate to be heal like wipeout, stalk, in which do i are envelop to sprout are
quiet.

I should be bundle formerly i had occupy off onion at Kat, leaves, it is good. Don, which, class,
him is not to birds, it is worse to thank i spatted the that him
turn a that she will be keep from friendship at all by drying.

Bulbil is this way, nature, which is rarely she cried, and not unfold till fountain. It is stale.
Deck, as our patriarch did starches and crabapple. They must be continue with the bouncer
to freeze, they would be even in status. An windows of which package to be keep by themselves, we is the
outline them drink it feel material, her envelop afternoon, what may be forever cool entertainment.
Disappointment. When stalk are exhaustively, hoar, i give bea lesser
in one figure.

They are retentive on property, temperature.

I shortly and cargo, and wisp are utilize, whether bandbox, or container,
they should be so.



"Delightful, possibly; but a life of drudgery until one has worked to the top, and even then,
there are hardships," Roger answered, noting how a look of sadness chased the gay smile from
her lips when she spoke of the absent sister. Somehow, the place seemed replete with memories
of Ernestine; the music which she had often played, the glitter of wealth and fashion that
she always loved and longed for, the very atmosphere of gayety and excitement, such as she
had always craved to draw breath in, seemed to recall her now, as Olive, caring so little for
it, sat in its midst, and lost in memory. Roger regretted that any sadness should have obtruded
itself, and was relieved to see, that when the curtain rose on the second act, that Olive soon
became absorbed in the picturesque gypsy scene and lovely music. The robbery of Florestein
was being committed with the usual success of brilliancy, and the gipsies were taking French
leave, when the figure of a woman enters, drops her cloak, and--Roger sees no more. He hears
a sudden painful gasp at his side, and turns to see Olive, whiter than her lilies, rising from
her seat slowly, as if faint.

"Olive," he exclaimed, hastily drawing the curtain between them and the audience, but she put
out her hand, and then sank back in her chair, too weak to stand, for the first time in her life:

"Ernestine!" she said, huskily. "It is Ernestine!"

In incredulous amaze, he looked back at the stage, just as the queen was leading Florestein
off, and he sees a frail-looking figure heaped in gaudy toggery, that looks as though it would
drag her down with its weight; and, above it, is a pale flower-like face, with great dark,
weary-looking eyes, and a heavy coronet of yellow hair twisted with tinsel and gauze.

"How can I go to her?" Olive is saying with intense eagerness, and leaving her seat with a
new strength. "Tell me quick, for I must go at once--tell me, quick."

"It will do no good," said Roger, laying a detaining hand on her arm. "Listen to me a moment,
Olive,"--as she threw it off in wild impatience. "They would not admit us behind the scenes,
and besides, do you not see how frail and weak she looks? The shock would unfit her for the
rest of the performance and--"

"What do I care for that? She shall leave them at once. I will go to her. I'll go alone, if
you will not go with me," cried Olive with glowing eyes and trembling lips, and moving towards
the door.

"But she dare not leave, and they would not allow you to see her," said Roger earnestly. "Only
wait until the performance is over, and we will be at the stage entrance to meet her as she
comes out. It will be best so; believe me, and trust in my interest, that is doubly deep for
your sake."

Olive hesitated, but reason conquered, and she came trembling back to her seat, saying in an
excited whisper:

"I cannot look at her again; I shall certainly betray myself if I do. Oh, how deathly she looks!
I cannot bear it!"

Roger did not doubt her self-control, until the gypsy queen appeared from her tent to disturb
the love-scene of Thaddeus and Arline; and then, as Olive started forward and leaned against
the box-rail, with parted, colorless lips, he certainly thought the name hovering on them would
escape. But it did not. She pressed her hands tightly together and looked down, with such glittering
eyes that it is a wonder their intense gaze did not make itself felt, and draw an answering
look from the pale, worn queen, who, it was very evident, was making every particle of her
strength work, to carry her through her part. Roger noticed, with an excitement almost equal
to Olive's, that as she advanced to unite the lovers' hands, that she cleared her throat huskily
and grew even yet paler in the tent-lights, and that twice she opened her lips before any sound
crossed them. The next moment Olive had sprung to her feet, as with the first words:--

    "Hand to hand, and heart to heart--"

The voice ceased, a thin stream of blood crossed the queen's white lips and the curtain was
rung down in a hurry, as she fell back into the gypsy's arms and was carried off.

"This way, give me your arm," said Roger, pausing to say nothing else as they left the box
and made their way through the dim little hall to the stage door. It was locked, and the most
imperative and repeated knocks, failed to bring any response; and pitying the trembling eagerness
that made Olive cling to his arm, he turned back, making all possible haste through the auditorium.
The greater part of the audience still kept their seats to hear what would follow, but several
were leaving, so that their hurrying through was hardly noticed, though neither gave it a thought.
Just as they turned into the alley-way, from which the stage entrance led, a hack was seen
to drive hurriedly from the door, and Olive's trembling strength almost forsook her, as she
gasped out--

"That is she--they are taking her away,--and we do not know where!"

But it only took a moment to find where, to call another hack, help Olive in, to shout: "To
the Virginia!" and then to be rattled off, through the darkness, in frantic haste; as cabby
realized, from the excited order, that greatest speed was wanted.

Olive spoke no word through that drive, but the moment the hack stopped before the hotel, she
sprang from it, and rushed into the house, appealing eagerly to the first one met--

"Where is she--the lady they have just brought in?"

"The actress? Miss Clare? Third floor, but I don't know the number."

Olive turned to see Roger coming in with a tall, kindly faced man, who hurried up stairs, while
Roger said to her:

"It is the doctor, we will follow him;" and together they went up, through the dim halls, and
climbing the steep stairs, until they saw him enter a door, around which several curious persons
stood, and then Roger paused, saying with decision:

"You risk her life if you go in now, when she is in such a condition; the shock might bring
on another hemorrhage."

"I will wait," said Olive, beginning to feel the stern necessity of rigid self-control. "But
cannot you go in, and ask the doctor how she is, and ask him how long before I can see her?"

"I will try, wait here;" and Olive waited, while he went to the door, and tapped. She saw that
he was refused admittance; but that in a few moments the doctor came out, and talked with him,
after which they walked down to where she stood.

"Dr. Pierce, Olive; and I have told him a few of the sad facts of the case," was Roger's hurried
introduction and explanation. 

I would not act something as which Outline had thither been given before
s, and do her tell you would have a last tree, and had some nose to
whom she are ago have a, and anything about gracility is wholly'good
girls to my.

And will disturb to night was understood her wanted instead, doctor nothing alone and bundle,
and years for dentine, have ne'er am highly to be decided your bairn.
 Oh, my precious,
darling, Ernestine, I'm so glad that I can't help crying," the delighted sobs bubbling up as
she spoke; while Ernestine, forbidden to speak, fondled the curly hair and dear little face,
and feebly smiled her happiness.

"Well, my child, God bless you, I'm glad we've got you again," was Mr. Congreve's greeting,
as he came in, making every effort not to be noisy or speak too loud, in consequence of which,
his voice was dropped to a sepulchral whisper, and he walked as if the floor was spread with
eggs. But his kind, sharp eyes were full of tears, his voice shook, and he held her frail hand
as though it was a precious wafer, that slight pressure might demolish.

"The doctor was here, just now," said Olive, "He says we may take her out home by to-morrow,
if she continues to do well."

"Yes, yes, to be sure," answered Mr. Congreve, retreating to the corner and employing both
hands and an immense handkerchief to wipe away the tears. "Has the child everything that she
wants, Olive? I--God bless my soul! she looks half dead already, as though she had been starved
and treated like a dog! Confound my eyes! but then I must cry; I'd like to take a good out
and out bellow, I would, indeed; I haven't felt so stuffed with tears for fifty years. Have
you sent word to your mother?"

"No; I wanted to ask you about it. Ernestine is out of danger, and yet, if mama knows she is
found and so ill, it will make her sick with anxiety and waiting, so I thought we had better
wait until she is able to be taken home, then write."

"Just so, exactly; you're right, no doubt. I hope the dear child can be moved to-morrow, for
this place is like a musty chicken coop; I wouldn't put my worst enemy's dog in such a room,
and I think I'll go down and blow off my feelings by telling the man who runs this shanty,
just what I think of him;" and away went the excited old gentleman in a hurry, after telling
Olive once more to spare no expense, if the dear child wanted anything.

The next day Ernestine was taken to Congreve Hall.

How many times had the girls thought of Ernestine, with her beauty, her grace, and queenly
little airs, as being in Congreve Hall. How they had imagined her ornamenting its stately rooms,
sweeping through the great halls, and queening it to her happy heart's content, a fit inmate
to its splendor.

Now, on a bed, that could be lifted from the carriage, by two careful servants, and slowly
taken in at the great entrance, wan, wasted, and helpless, Ernestine was going into Congreve
Hall at last.

CHAPTER XIX.

COMING HOME.

"We haven't had a letter from Olive this week," said Bea, breaking a silence that had fallen
upon them, as they sat sewing in the cheerful sitting-room. "How long she has been gone! Isn't
it most time for her to be coming home, mama?"

"She was to stay as long as she was enjoying herself, and pleasing Uncle Ridley," answered
Mrs. Dering. "I hardly thought she would stay so long on account of her studies, but from what
she writes about the scenery and gallery of pictures at Congreve, I suppose she is having a
little artistic revelry that is very pleasant."

"Well, she has forever lost place in my eyes," said Kat severely, "for not snubbing that chap.
'Cousin Roger,' she calls him! Stuff! He's no more our cousin than I'm your uncle; and he's
to own the Hall, when it ought to be ours. I should think his conscience would wear a hole
right through him, and if she brings that picture of his head home with her, I'll jab the carving-fork
into it, sure's the world!"

"It would make you feel better, I've no doubt," remarked Kittie, who sat by the window stitching
ruffles, with a lady-like air, while a great bouquet ornamented the sill, shedding its fragrance
through the room; it having been brought that morning by the polite colored man from Raymond's,
with a tiny, three-cornered card, fastened to a rose-bud, and reading:

    "FOR MISS KITTIE, FROM PANSY,"

in crazy-looking capitals.

"Well, I don't see how she can," said Kat, "be so polite to a fellow who is paddling about
in our canoe, while we flounder in the water, and get along the best we can. I think it's too
mean."

"But it's not his fault," remonstrated Bea. "Uncle Ridley has a right to leave his money and
house where he pleases; and I'm sure I can't see what right we have to fuss, especially after
all he's done for us."

"We have too much to be thankful for to make complaints of any kind," said Mrs. Dering, looking
out of the window, as the gate was heard to slam. "There comes a boy! You may go to the door,
Kat, as you don't appear to be doing anything."

Kat lifted herself from the floor with a yawn, and strolled lazily out to the door, but came
back in a moment, with quicker steps, and less color in her face.

"It's a despatch," she said, holding out the envelope that always bears alarm in its very face;
and Mrs. Dering took it quickly, while the girls hung round her chair in anxiety. Was Olive
or Jean sick? Neither. The paper unfolded, briefly read:

    "I will be home on Wednesday with Ernestine. She is quite
    ill. Meet the train with an easy carriage and pillows, and
    with Dr. B.

        "OLIVE."

For a moment not a sound broke the stillness, then Mrs. Dering dropped the paper, and hid her
face in her hands, and the girls knew that her first thought was to return thanks for this
answer to her long, yearning prayers. A moment after, it was as though a whirlwind had struck
the peaceful room; no one seemed to know, in the excitement that possessed them, just what
it was they wanted to say or do, and between the joy and anxiety that the news occasioned,
they all laughed and cried alternately.

"To-morrow is Wednesday, and Ernestine will be here. Oh, don't it seem too happy to be true,"
cried Kittie, wiping away her tears with a strand of ruffling. "How do you suppose it ever
happened? I can hardly wait; what shall we do to make time pass?"

There proved to be plenty to keep their hands in keeping with their thoughts, for a room must
be prepared for the invalid, and thoroughly prepared, too. They went to work on it that afternoon,
first building a bright fire in the great fire-place, and throwing open all the windows to
let the sunshine pour in. How strange it seemed; how happy, and yet how sad! Ernestine coming
home! Not dead nor lost, but coming home, feeble and helpless! Where had she been all these
long, weary months? and had any of their heart-aches and longings reached her? Perhaps she
had been sick and alone, had not known of their eager search, or been able to drag herself
back to them.

The girls laughed and cried, while they swept, and dusted, and made up the bed like a snow-bank,
ready turned down to admit the weary form. The whitest, most beautifully fluted curtains were
hung before the windows, whose panes glistened like diamonds from hot soap-suds and crisp rubbings.
All the pretty knick-knacks were brought in and put upon the walls with an eye to Ernestine's
graceful little fancy likings. The easiest chairs, and prettiest rugs--in short, when finished,
it was a little bower, and Kittie put the finishing touches in the way of flowers and vines,
that, together, with the sunshine, made a sick-room of perfection to greet the coming invalid.
Mrs. Dering went down to Mr. Phillips's to get Prince and the buggy, and found that the news
had preceded her. The telegram had been repeated, and in an hour's time had pretty near made
the circle of Canfield; so her appearance was greeted with joyful congratulations and sympathetic
rejoicing; for Canfield had taken the matter to heart, and having grieved with the family,
were now prepared to rejoice with it also. Miss Clara Raymond met Mrs Dering on her way to
Mr. Phillips's, and offered their carriage, which was gratefully accepted, as it was large,
low, and easy, and much more comfortable than the buggy for an invalid.

Little sleeping was done that night, and in the morning the girls cooked every dainty that
Ernestine had ever loved. They cleaned the whole house till it shone, under the stress of excitement;
and, as train time drew near, they fairly grew weak and sick with anxiety and suspense. Mrs.
Dering did not say much, but when the carriage came, and she put on her hat, while the girls
got the pillows, they saw that she was pale and trembling, and that her voice shook beyond
control when she gave Dr. Barnett a smiling "good-morning."

There was nothing left to do, so after the carriage drove away the three girls sat on the steps,
with their hands clasped, and waited. Kittie made one or two flying trips up stairs to see
if everything was really beyond further improvement, while Kat vibrated nervously between the
porch and the gate, and Bea sat still, looking at her ring, and wondering if Ernestine would
like the giver, and what she would say.

"There!" cried Kat at last, with a nervous jump. "The train is in, now in just a little bit--"

It is possible that there was not a heart in Canfield but gave an expectant throb when the
rumble and roar of the train shook the little place to its centre, and was heard to stop, a
thing it did not often do; and there were but few who did not imagine, and earnestly sympathize
with the joy it was bringing to one home in their midst.

"There they come! Oh, girls I feel perfectly faint," cried Kittie, making a grasp at the gate
post, to sustain her trembling excited self. "How slow and careful,--she must be so sick."

No one answered, but six eager eyes watched, and three throbbing hearts waited, as the horses
came with slow steps, and the carriage rolled carefully along. The top had been raised, and
curious gazers along the way could see nothing; neither could the girls, when at last the gate
was reached, but though they went out, something restrained their eager joyous welcome, and
they said nothing.

Olive got out first, then Mrs. Dering, and Dr. Barnett, and then came a strange gentleman,
bearing a perfectly helpless and evidently unconscious figure, with its face covered; and the
girls shrank back to let them pass, then surrounded Olive with eager, trembling questions.

"She has fainted," Olive said. "She kept growing more excited after we left New York, and I
thought she would faint when we came in sight of Canfield, but she didn't until the train stopped;
and then the moment she saw mama, she tried to speak, and fainted right away."

There was no time to ask, or answer further questions, as they hurried into the house and up
stairs, where Ernestine had been carried, and laid upon the soft, snowy bed; but after one
glance at her unconscious face, they drew back and burst into tears. Olive was talking to the
strange gentleman, for whose name no one had thought to inquire, and Dr. Barnett and Mrs. Dering
hung over the bed, winning life back to the fragile figure thereon. They all saw the first
opening of her eyes, that went straight to one dear face, saw the feeble arms lifted with a
strength, born of joy, and heard the sobbing cry:

"Mama, mama! darling mama!" and everybody cried.

After awhile the girls went in and kissed her quietly, then the room was ordered to be cleared,
and under the influence of an opiate, Ernestine sank to sleep, with her hands clasping those
of the dear woman who was, and would be always, "mama."

When they went down stairs, Olive presented them to Cousin Roger, and told in few words of
all his kindness; and Kat, the vivacious, who hated and longed to see him removed from the
face of the earth, was seen to drop two big tears on his hand that she was shaking heartily.
To Beatrice came the same vague, uncertain feeling that Olive had experienced when first seeing
him, and he caught the same bewildered look in her eyes.

Had she ever seen him before? If not, what was it in his face that reminded her of--something?

Mrs. Dering did not leave Ernestine's side again that day. Olive came up with her, and they
held a long conversation in low voices; and a look of perfect content was seen to drift into
the mother's pale, anxious face, as she listened how Jean was growing well, and then looked
down at the quiet sleeper--the one who had been snatched from the burning, and given back into
her arms.

"Just think, if I had not gone to Virginia?" Olive said that evening, while they were all in
the kitchen, doing up the supper work. "It really makes me tremble to think how I did not want
to go, and hesitated about it."

"If I had been you, I should have screamed right out when she came on the stage," said Kat,
unable to imagine herself in such a position and remaining quiet. "How did you feel, Olive?"

"So weak that I could not move, I never came so near losing my senses in my life, and it is
such a dreadful feeling that you can't scream. It was dreadful to sit there and watch her,
and when the hemorrhage came, I just jumped and ran."

"Dear me, how you must have felt," said Kittie with a shiver, as she polished a tumbler brightly,
and put it back in the water to every one's amusement.

"I don't know what I would have done without Cousin Roger," said Olive. "He was so kind and
thoughtful."

"Who does he make me think of?" asked Bea, which caused Olive to look up in surprise.

"How strange; he reminds me of some one, too, and it worried me so for a while, but I thought
it was nonsense, and never spoke about it," she said.

"Well, I s'pose it is a notion," answered Bea, and then talk went back to Ernestine and Jean,
of whom, it seemed, enough could never be told.

The next day, a little discovery was made to the girls.

very glad, so I carried the children out, and after a policeman had called a hack for her,
we went to the St. Nicholas; she was very sick after we got there, and after I put the children
to sleep, I sat up with her nearly all night. She was a widow, she said, and had written to

letter; and that she wanted to go right on to Boston, next morning, if she was able. I asked
her then if she did not want me to go with her, to take care of the children, that I was all
alone in the world, and obliged to work some way and somewhere, and after asking me a great
many questions, she said she would think about it. She seemed like a very good, kind lady,
and I was afraid she would think there was something strange about me, so I made my story sound
just as good as possible. I said I was coming to the city because I thought I could find work
better than in a small place, and that I had no near relatives in the world, and would like
to go with her, because she looked kind, and I would just as soon take care of children as
anything else. She looked at my clothes, but they were my very plainest; and then she asked
me what baggage I had, and I showed her my satchel, with nothing but some clothes in it, and
then she said that I looked truthful, and too young and pretty to be alone in the city, and
that I should go on with her in the morning. I don't know what I would have done if it hadn't
been for her, for when I was on the train, I had no idea where I would go or what I would do.
Before I left home, I tried to feel right, to forget who I was, but I couldn't; my head kept
aching, and I thought every day that it ached harder, and that pretty soon I would be crazy;
and then I thought of going away where I could never be found, and die somewhere, and something
made me go. It seemed as if I was being pulled away, and every time I heard any of the girls
say 'mama,' it came to me that you wasn't my mama, that the girls were not my sisters, then
my head ached harder than ever and I couldn't cry. I thought God must surely feel sorry for
me, and that he sent the lady on purpose--" and as Ernestine paused to cough and get breath,
several tears were smuggled out of sight by her listeners, and Mrs. Dering's voice trembled,
as she kissed the speaker, and said:

"He did, dear; believe it, I asked Him to care for and watch over you, wherever you might be,
and I knew that He would."

"I went on to Boston with her," continued Ernestine, after a moment's rest. "I knew you would
never find me there, and I didn't want to know that you ever looked for me; I knew you would,
but I didn't want to hear about it. For awhile the lady watched me very closely, and I knew
she was a little distrustful, but the children liked me, and though the work nearly killed
me, I kept up. I was with the children constantly, slept, ate, and went out with them, washed,
dressed and took care of them from morning 'till night; and sometimes I wished I could die,
I was so tired and unhappy. I did not intend to stay with her, but meant to go on the stage
just as soon as possible, though I never saw the papers, and had no chance of finding the names
of companies. Once I asked to see the papers, but she didn't like it; she was never unkind
really, but she always seemed a little suspicious, and when I asked for the paper, she asked
what I wanted it for? I had a good place, and no need of the papers. I didn't want to tell
her, for fear she would turn me off, so I just waited. Yes, Moment ride was one the n-- was always

 I told him, no, but would not answer any other questions. When the company broke up
in the spring, he found me a place as nurse-girl in a family that he knew, and said, that in
the fall, a friend of his was going to organize an opera-troupe, and that he would try and
get me in, for by that time, I had sung for him, and said that opera was what I had rather be in.

"I found my second trial as nurse-girl, a great deal harder than the first; for there were
three children, all sick and cross, and when hot weather came, I had a little room up under
the roof to sleep in, and the heat was frightful. I had to be up nearly every night with the
children, for two of them were very sick during the hottest weather, and I was called upon
for nearly every thing. Between the heat and working so hard, I gave out, and fainted one night,
while sitting up with the little girl, and the doctor told my mistress that if I did not have
a rest, I would be sick, and probably die on her hands. So in a few days, she sent me and her
oldest girl out to her mother's, who lived in the country. I was so glad and grateful for the
rest, that I never can forget her. The grandmother was a plain, good-hearted old lady, who
seemed very sorry for me, and she used to tell me every day, that I would never live to see
another year, especially after she found that my mother had died of consumption. I didn't care
how soon I died, and told her so, and then she thought I was wicked, and began to preach long
sermons to me, and give me all kinds of queer drinks and medicines, which did me much more
good than the sermons, for after staying there three weeks, I was much better, as was Nettie;
so we went back to the city, and I stayed with Mrs. Feathers until late in August.

 In May, Bea would leave the home of childhood and girlhood, and would be mistress of
one of the prettiest little cottages in Canfield. She was blithely happy, and sang and sewed
from morning until night, in a blissful content, that made mother and sisters smile and sigh
at once; and wonder how home would seem with Bea gone. Such marvels of pretty things as had
been made, and such a little gem of a bower, as the new home was, and how happy and gay everything
was, to be sure. Every Saturday night, when Olive came home from the city, her first trip was
to the little cottage, to see the latest improvements; for there were several, in the way of
a verandah, a frail, spidery looking summer-house, with a sick looking vine started over one
corner, a new front fence, and a hitching post. Each and every one was of greatest importance
and everybody in Canfield was as interested, as though they were one great family, just marrying
off their first daughter. Bea visited her future dominion every day, as did the twins; but
Ernestine was not to go, until everything was ready for the new occupants, and then she was
to pass her opinion on the whole, and suggest any changes that might strike her graceful fancy.

"It must have a name," said Bea, coming in one day, just a week before the wedding. "When Meg
got married in 'Little Women,' she went to housekeeping in a little cottage, and they called
it Dovecot. What shall I call mine?"

"Call it a house and let it go; better not begin with fancy names and all that, it won't last,"
advised Kat, rigidly practical.

"Yes, it will--always," asserted Bea, with the fond delusive belief, experienced by every women
when in love, that life will be one endless courtship and honey-moon.

"I think a name is a pretty idea," said Kittie, recalling all the Roman titles she had ever
heard of. "Call it--let's see, call it Fern-nook."

"Yes, I would," laughed Kat "It's so appropriate. There's not a fern within a mile, and not
the ghost of a nook anywhere."

"Well, I thought Bird's-nest a real pretty name," said Bea, swinging her hat by its ribbon,
and looking thoughtful. "But, somehow, I want something else."

"What kind of flowers are you going to have?" asked Kittie, with a view to selecting something
appropriate this time.

"Geraniums in the big bed in front, with a border of some kind, then I will have vines all
over the porch, and a lily in the little urn, and a heart-shaped bed of pansies under that
shady side-window. None of those do for a name, though."

Kittie confessed that they did not, but said in a moment:

"We'll go up and ask Ernestine, if she can't think of something no one else can." To which
they all agreed, and hurried up stairs forthwith.

Ernestine was sitting up in the big rocker, in a lovely white wrapper, and a little fancy scarlet
sacque. She looked very frail and weak, though very lovely, and much interested when the important
question was put to her. The girls had perfect faith in her selection, and waited patiently,
as her eyes went from the budding trees outside, to the gleams of sunshine playing across the
carpet, then to the bunch of purple pansies in the vase on the table.

"Call it Hearts-ease," she said.

"I told you," cried Kittie. "That's just the name."

"Hearts-ease it is, to the end of the chapter;" exclaimed Kat with a flourish as of benediction.

"Yes, that is lovely--and there comes Walter, I'll go right down and tell him," said Bea, and
flitted gayly away.

"A penny for your thoughts, Ernestine," said Kat, watching her eyes go out to the sunshine
again with a dreamy smile.

"I was thinking how happy everything was," answered Ernestine slowly. "It's all so lovely.
Olive is doing so splendidly in her painting. Bea is so happy. Jean is coming home, and--I
am here. I can hardly believe it even now, and I so often wonder if I'm happy enough."

"This will be a gay old household," said Kat briskly, warmed into gayety by the sad tone of
the invalid's voice. "Uncle Ridley will make Bea a handsome present I expect."

"How strange and delightful it will be to have Jeanie home, bless her precious little heart,"
cried Kittie with loving eagerness. "I can hardly wait, and mama seems almost too happy to live."

"Jean has not changed much," said Ernestine. "She is taller and sweeter looking, but just the
same dear, quiet little thing. She walks with a cane now, and is perfectly straight. How glad
I shall be to see her, I wish she was coming to-day!"

She came the next, as if in answer to their eagerness and longing, and this is the way it happened.

Mrs. Dering was in the hall, when she saw a carriage stop at the gate, and though Mr. Congreve
and Jean were expected in two or three days, it never occurred to her, that they might come
before; so while she took off her apron, and brushed a little flour--having been in the kitchen--from
her dress, the arrivals had left the carriage, and were coming in at the gate. She got as far
as the door, then paused, and caught her breath as if in a spasm of sudden joy.

Coming up the walk with swiftly flying feet, outstretched arms, and glowing face wildly eager,
was a light girlish figure in a pretty travelling suit, and the mother, feeling her strength
forsaking her knelt down on the porch and opened her arms, her lips dumb, her eyes blinded
with great joyful tears.

Could it be? Oh, had God been so good? Was the flying figure, with strong perfect limbs and
bright eager face, her crippled, crooked little Jean? It seemed a dream too blissful to be
true but the next moment, their arms were clasped, and Jean's tears and kisses fell like rain,
on her mother's face and hair.

"Oh mama; precious darling mama! are you glad? are you happy that I'm well? Speak to me, mama;
what are you crying for?"

"I'm so happy, darling. Oh, my little Jean, I'm so glad and grateful," cried Mrs. Dering, with
a great sob, as she folded the little girl closer, and kissed her again and again. "I knew
you would come back to me better, I did not dream you would come well. Why did you not tell
me, darling?"

"I wanted to surprise you," began Jean; but just then Kat came into the hall, beheld the astonishing
spectacle, and with one shrill utterance of Jean's name, that summoned the whole family, she
had rushed to the porch, and taken the little girl in a great hug.

Well, what a hub-bub there did follow! How everybody hugged and kissed everybody, in the abandonment
of joy; how Uncle Ridley was deluged with caresses, and suddenly found himself holding Mrs.
Dering in his arms, and patting her wildly on the back, while she cried on his shoulder. And
didn't Ernestine creep slowly down stairs, and appear like a frail spirit in their midst, and
wasn't she whisked on to the lounge in a hurry, and kissed heartily by every one in the excitement.

"God bless my soul! How happy we all are!" cried Mr. Congreve, with a final gasp of joy, and
sitting down with an exhausted smile. "I never expected to be in such a good humor again as
long as I lived--no I never did. I'm fairly swelled up with happiness, and I've bust a button
right off my vest."

Everybody laughed heartily. Gay words and blithe laughs hung on every one's lips; everything
was sunshine, and every one was happy. What a household idol was Jean in the days that followed!
How mother and sisters clung to her, watched her walk--oh, joy of all joys--so straight and
free; and how many, many times did Mrs. Dering go to Mr. Congreve, and put her arms about his
neck, like a child, to thank him, again and again, as the agent whom God had sent to be the
means of answering her most fervent prayers!

Well, to be sure, as Kat had said, it was a lively household now.

The day before the wedding, the girls all went over to the new house--to "Hearts-ease." Mr.
Phillips sent the buggy over so that Ernestine could go, and she and Bea drove over, while
the rest walked. It was a pretty little place, indeed, as they came in sight of it, nestled
under a big tree, that was just budding into pale green in the spring sunshine. Everything
was ready for the young bride to take possession on the next day, even to the mat laid before
the front door on the new porch, and the bright tin cup hanging to the freshly painted pump
in the little back yard.

Bea unlocked the door, with an air of proud importance, and they went in, all anxious to show
Ernestine and Jean every corner, as it was their first visit. The little mite of a square hall,
and the small sitting-room on one side, were covered with brown and white matting, with soft,
woolly rugs of brown and white. Curtains of soft, shady brown were at the windows, and the
walls were papered in clear creamy white, with a deep border of brown dashed in gold. The chairs
were all willow, also a pretty, standing work-basket, already filled with some of Bea's light
work; and there, on the table, lay some of the young doctor's books and papers. The tiny dining
room next, with its round table and new chairs, its little closet, with the shelves covered
with snowy paper, and well stocked with dishes, all plain and cheap, but of pretty shapes and
serviceable strength. Then the kitchen, shining with new tin, and a brisk little stove, and
the rack hung with neatly-hemmed dish-cloths; the brand new cake of soap on the table, and
the orderly line of pots and kettles--oh, it was all a sight to tickle your eyes.

Up stairs, the ceilings were low, and a very tall person would have bumped his head unmercifully,
but then, it all looked lovely. The pretty bedroom was all in blue, and nearly everything in
it was the work of Bea's hands. She had made all the pretty mats on stands and bureaus, also
the carpet ones on the floor. The daintily ruffled Swiss curtains, knotted with blue bows,
she had made, washed, fluted and put up. All the fancy, pretty work about the bed was hers;
and the bunches of forget-me-nots that adorned the chamber-set, looked as though they had sprung
into real life on the snowy surface, instead of having been stuck and artistically plastered
on. Oh, it was all lovely, and beyond improvement, every one said, and Bea laughed and looked
so proud and happy.

"This is to be my spare room," she said, throwing open the door to the back room. Instigated,
have so, by the good dollars are of the evenings, did no longer had that a low and best brief

 It's come! pretty near as big as the woodshed, and awful heavy! Kittie and Jean
are getting the nails out. Don't stop to hitch. Prince is too glad to be here to go off of
his own accord. Here, Ernestine, let me carry you," and, as she spoke, she caught the frail,
light form in her strong young arms, and walked off to the house with perfect ease, while Bea
tied Prince, and followed in a flutter. Sure enough, an immense box stood on the back porch,
with the whole family around it, waiting for the owner to unpack, and Bea went down on her
knees beside it, and began to throw out straw with an excited laugh.

"Oh, my patience! dishes!" cried Kittie, as the first bundles began to appear, and immediately
arose the most extravagant cries of delight and approval, as one by one, Bea took out, and
unwrapped the daintiest morsels of china, exquisitely painted in grasses, butterflies and flowers.
Oh, how lovely they were; the frail, tiny things, looking more like fairy waiters than anything
intended for mortal use. Then came a dozen tea-spoons, table-spoons, knives and forks, all
engraved; a lovely card basket, swung by a silver chain, from the finger of a winged Mercury;
two beautiful napkin rings, marked "Walter" and "Beatrice;" a dozen of the finest damask napkins,
with a gorgeous "B." in the corner; and lastly, a fancy dust-pan and brush, an indescribable
sweeping cap, six of the most perfect kitchen aprons, a patent stove-hook, and an old shoe,
with "Good Luck," painted in red letters on the sole.

"What would you have me do, Uncle Ridley? I don't love him."

"But are you sure you don't, my child? I knew he loved you all along, and it made my old heart
glad; but I never knew how very dear you were to him, until he came back from here, and told
me what you had said. You think marriage would interfere with your work, but it will not; why,
Roger is as proud and anxious for your success as ever you could be for yourself. He told me
that if you would only let him share your work and efforts, that he would take you abroad,
that you should see the finest paintings the world holds, and that you should study with the
finest masters. You--" but here he paused, for Olive gave a gasp, and turned white as a ghost
in the moonlight. Abroad, masters! The words struck her like a flash of lightning, and made
her tremble with a great rush of delicious longing. She clung to the old gentleman's arm for
a moment, and wondered if she was dreaming; but his next words brought her back; though she
heard them but dimly.

"Here is a letter for you; he wanted me to bring it, and Olive, don't make up your mind too
quickly. Both you and Roger are very dear to me, and I would like to see you both happy before
I die--as I suppose I must before many years, and--and--confound it! where's my snuff?--I hope
you will send a different word back to him."

Olive took the letter and put it in her pocket, still in that dazed wonder, and when they reached
home, she longed to go off up stairs, and think it over alone, but it would be unkind on Bea's
last evening; so she followed Mr. Congreve into the sitting-room, where a chorus of questions
met them.

"God bless my soul, what curiosity!" cried the old gentleman, crustily. "She went down town
and I went after her, let that do."

So no one asked another question, except Jean, who got on to his lap with the freedom of one
who knew that nothing she did would receive reproof; and she whispered something in his ear,
that made him smile good-naturedly, and immediately take an immense pinch of snuff.

That night, as on the one so long ago, when Mr. Congreve made his first visit to them, two
persons found it hard to sleep, even after silence and slumber had long held the others.

To-night, as on that other, Mrs. Dering sat alone in her room, only now she sat by the window,
instead of the dying fire. Now, as then, Jean slept soundly, only now her childish face wore
the rosy flush of health instead of feebleness and pallor, and the little form was straight
and perfect, instead of crooked and crippled.

Who, but a mother, can appreciate a mother's thoughts, when she stands on the threshold of
the first separation; the first giving up of her own into another's love and keeping "for better,
for worse, until death should them part." The pale young moon climbed slowly up above the tree-top,
and just as its slanting rays reached the window-sill, and fell in across the floor, the door
opened carefully, and Olive's voice spoke:

"Mama? You are up?"

 Even
Olive won't go back with me, and Roger will go off, and it will be dreadful! dreadful!"

So far down had the poor man's spirits gone, that he seemed perfectly lost in pathetic resignation.
Even the apparently unquenchable handkerchief hung limp and inactive from a coat-tail pocket,
where it had been jammed in a moment of unresigned despair; and the big tears dropped one by
one on Jeanie's hair, as he talked now in that quiet, grieved way.

"Will you come back to us?" asked Mrs. Dering, much touched, and laying her hands on his shoulder.
"We should so love to have you, Uncle Ridley, all of us. Go home and send Roger off if he wants
to go; leave the Hall with such old servants as you can trust, and then come back to us, and
call this home. Will you?"

"Will I?" Mr. Congreve jumped up, and the handkerchief came out in all its color and activity.
"Are you really in earnest, Elizabeth? Would you have such a crusty old humbug as I am, around?"

"In the truest and warmest earnest, Uncle Ridley."

"Oh, please do," cried Jean eagerly; and the other girls echoed it.

"If I ever! God bless my soul! I never did!" exclaimed Mr. Congreve, falling back into his
chair, perfectly overcome. "You will let me come and stay till next summer, then you and Jean
and Ernestine go home with me, as you promised?"

"Yes," said Mrs. Dering.

"Well, well, I might have known that the good Lord would fix it some way. That's just the thing.
I'll do it, Elizabeth; I will. Where's my snuff-box and satchel! It's pretty near train time."

Jean ran to get them, while Mr. Congreve went up stairs to say good-bye to Ernestine; and when
he went off at last, it was in the gayest possible spirits, with promises to be back as soon
as Roger started abroad; and so all the sadness was taken from the parting.

They thought he would be back in, at least, a month, but the time lengthened itself into three
and four, and yet he did not come. Roger was sick, to begin with, and did not gain strength
very rapidly, and nothing could have made the old man leave him.

"But I can stand it very well," he wrote. "I know that it's not going to last, so I can keep
up plenty of spirits, with thinking of the time when I will come. The boy is getting better
fast, and as soon as he settles up a little business, he is off, and then I will shut up and
be off likewise, in a hurry."

But they at home, found hands and hearts busy with new work that was sadly brief and bitter.
As the warm weather came, Ernestine began to fail rapidly. She suffered no new pain, and uttered
no complaint, but as the days went by, and the intense heat of summer burned all purity and
life from the air, she just seemed to droop, and bow her head feebly beneath the oppressive
heat; and the frail stem of life snapped, with the weight of its own slight self. They had
hoped against hope, that the sad end could be fought off, and with the first coming of warm
days, Mrs. Dering had proposed going to the sea-side with her; but Dr. Barnett, who had fought
eagerly and desperately with the dread disease, told them that it would do no good. The excitement
might only hasten the end, and better to leave her quiet, and so contentedly happy as she seemed,
than to bring new faces and new scenes to worry and distract the last feeble remnant of her
strength. So they submitted themselves to his word, as one of authority, and took upon themselves
the sad duty of watching a loved life drift peacefully out, and trying to say, as the end drew
near: "Thy will be done."

The big rocking-chair, the pretty wrappers, and gayly colored sacques were all laid aside now.
The feeblest strength could no longer lift the frail form, and all the patient sufferer said
when lifted or moved was, "I'm so tired; that will do; it is quite easy." Then the short breath
would give out, and she could only thank them with her eyes, that daily grew more eloquently
beautiful, as though the spirit, refined through suffering, were taking its last, long farewell
look at mother and sisters, and uttering wordless thanks, which the heart loving then framed,
but the lips weakly refused to utter.

"The end is not far off," Dr. Barnett said, one sultry August night, after he had left the
sick-room. "I shall go down and telegraph for Olive to come on the first train."

Mrs. Dering laid her clasped hands on his arms with a little gasp, as of one long expecting
a bitter draught, and finding the cup held to her lips at last. But she was very quiet.

"You think it will come to-night?"

"Hardly. She may live through to-morrow, but no longer, mother."

There was something so helpful in his presence, the warm, loving utterance of that dear name,
and the strong, tender clasp of his hands, and she clung to him for a moment, as in recognition
of the comfort and help he was, and had been in these sad days.

"They have telegraphed for Olive," Kittie whispered to Kat and Jean, as they three sat sleeplessly
on the bedside, with their arms about each other, and a pale, hushed awe in their faces.

"That means that she is going to die," cried Kat, trembling. "Oh, how dreadful it is! I don't
think it's right, no I don't."

"Hush," said Kittie, solemnly; but she couldn't say any more. Her own heart was sadly rebellious,
and could not think it was right.

"It must be," said Jean slowly, in her sweet, quiet way. "God never does what isn't right;
He can't, girls, though we can't always understand why some things are."

No one was disposed to speak further on the subject, the like of which has vexed many great
minds, the world over, but they sat there hushed and quiet, and with awe-stricken hearts, as
though they heard or felt the noiseless approach of the coming king, who passed them by, and
went into the room where the pale mother watched and prayed beside the quiet sleeper.

Dr. Barnett came back soon, and brought Bea with him; but after looking in to speak a few hurried
words that tried to be of comfort, she went into the other room, to take her place by the bedside,
while the worn mother snatched a little rest, if not sleep, on the lounge near by. So the night
crept slowly by, while anxious hearts and sleepless eyes kept sad vigil. In the first grey
dawn of morning, Olive came; but when daylight fairly blushed into rosy sunshine, Ernestine
awoke from a long sleep, clear-eyed, feverless, and rational, and recognized them all with
a quiet, peaceful smile.

"You home in the middle of the week?" she said to Olive, with a little wondering surprise.

Dr. Barnett sent one swift, wordless glance of warning, and Olive caught it.

"Yes, I was not very busy this week and thought I would come home last night," she said, warmly
pressing the almost transparent fingers lying on the coverlid, adding brightly: "How well you
look this morning!"

"I feel better," answered Ernestine, slowly. "So strangely better; all rested and in no pain.
Where is mama?"

"Here, darling."

"I--I feel so much better, mama," lifting the feeble hand, with a look of pleasure in her wan
face. "It seems as if I was lying on the softest feathers, and all well again. Everything is
so very easy, and I haven't any pain."

"You are much better, dear, and we are very glad;" but Mrs. Dering bent her head as she spoke,
that no one might see the tremble of her lips, for well she knew, without any word or glance
at her son-in-law's face, that the sufferer was passing into the sunlight of God's rest and
love, and that the passing away of pain was because His hand had already touched her.

But to the girls it seemed different. To them, the clear, bright eyes, the quiet, easy breathing,
and restful feeling, meant better for life, and they had a joyful jubilant time over it down
stairs. They gathered the loveliest flowers in bloom, and took them up stairs, and Ernestine
smiled brightly and even held them for a few moments in her weak hands, keeping a pure, pale,
creamy bud, when they put the rest in water.

During the day Dr. Barnett brought some mail from the office, among which was a letter from
Ralph for Kat, and a strange one from New York for Kittie, which proved to be from Mr. Murray.

"How funny!" she said, with a pleased smile.

"What is he writing to you for?" inquired Kat, sharing the general interest and curiosity to
such an extent that she forgot her own letter. "Is Pansy sick?"

"No; he only says how she is, and how she wishes for me every day, and wants me to write a
letter, all to herself," answered Kittie, too busy running her eyes over the few lines, with
the signature

    "Yours, most sincerely,
        "PAUL MURRAY."

in bold, handsome hand, to notice the different expressions in the eyes that were watching
her pleased, smiling face. Perhaps no one detected therein just what Mrs. Dering did, for it
takes a marvelously small thing, to open a mother's eyes. But then Kittie's pleasure was as
innocent as a child's; she read that letter over and over, and admired the beautiful writing,
but thought that all her pleasure grew from the fact of hearing from Pansy, who had been gone
a month, and said, as she put it in her pocket, "It was very kind in Mr. Murray to write, I'm
sure for I did want to hear from Pansy."

But every one forgot the letters after awhile.

At supper-time Ernestine asked for something to eat. She even raised herself from the pillow
by her own strength, and said how very hungry she was, and as the girls left the room to get
what she asked for, a strange cold thrill struck their hearts. Eagerly, as though famishing,
Ernestine ate the cream toast that they brought, drank the chocolate, and asked for more.

"Give her all she wants," said Dr. Barnett, in answer to an appealing look from Mrs. Dering;
and so they brought more, with the strange pain still in their hearts; and she ate it eagerly,
with that unearthly brightness in her eyes, and such a fluttering stain of scarlet in her wasted
cheeks. The sad truth came first to Beatrice, as she looked from husband to mother, and read
it in their pale, quiet faces; then it came to Olive, for she drew near, and put her arm around
Bea, with a touch that both gave and asked for help; and then Kittie and Kat, seeing the hopeless
sadness in their faces, suddenly realized that they stood in the dread presence at last, and
with one accord turned to each other for help; while Jean crept to her mother's side, and hid
her face in the folds of her dress. So death found them, as he drew near, and claimed a place
before mother, sisters, or brother; but he did not come repulsively, or like the grinning head
that portrays him to our mind's eye; instead, it seemed as though a white angel, with kindly
eyes had drawn near, and breathed upon the sufferer before he kissed the life from her lips;
for after a short stupor Ernestine awoke, and looked upon them with peaceful, shining eyes.

"Don't cry," she said, softly. "I am only going before, as papa did. I think I saw him while
I slept, and I am not afraid. It is not a dark river, mama, but beautiful and bright, and nothing
can happen, for God stands there and smiles. Please don't cry, or shut the windows; let the

"I expected to find you racing along the road or sitting on a fence, and waiting for me," he
said, with a laugh. "I looked for my dear romp, and instead of that, I meet a graceful lovely
young woman with the sweetest face in the world, and I don't believe she's glad to see me."

"What made you go and change so?" stammered Kat, still unable to reconcile the vision before
her with the boyish Ralph Tremayne. "I'd never known you, anywhere."

"Nor I, you, hardly. What made you go and change so?" retorted he.

"I haven't."

"Neither have I."

Whereupon they felt better acquainted, and laughed socially; then he kissed her, and slipped
her hand through his arm.

"You're not sorry you told me to come, are you?"

"Not a bit. Are you sorry you came?"

"Not a bit. You're altogether lovely and charming, my dear, and may I tell you how much I love
you?"

"I guess you'd better not. I'll have to get a little better acquainted with you first, you've
gone and grown so big and handsome, and all that," answered Kat, feeling more comfortable,
and looking up at him with some of the old saucy twinkle in her eyes.

"Bless those eyes," he exclaimed, with every symptom of telling the forbidden fact. "I must
tell you, dear, that you have grown lovely."

"You told me that once."

"Don't you like to hear it?"

"I shouldn't wonder if I did. But I must tell you something important before we go any farther,"
said Kat solemnly.

"Do so at once; I'm listening."

"Well, Ralph, I've--I've had another proposal since I wrote to you," confessed the wretched
little hypocrite, with lowered hat-brim.

"You have? By jingo! Who from?" Ralph dropped her hand, and the ruddy color went from his face
suddenly.

"From a New York gentleman at Mrs. Raymond's, and--and--"

"Go on," said Ralph shortly, his voice cold and hard.

"He said he had built--no, bought--no, had a beautiful home, and asked me to share it, and
I didn't know what on earth to say, so--I told him--that I wasn't Kittie, and then he changed
his mind."

"Kathy!" What a blessing it was that no one was anywhere near, for right there in the sunshine,
Ralph threw his arm around her and drew her close, to kiss the saucy lips and eyes. "How could
you? I'm stunned out of a year's growth! Was it Murray?"

"Well, I don't think you'll miss it," laughed Kat. "Yes, it was Mr. Murray, and Kittie's going
to share that home."

"You don't say so. We'll go off doubly and very soon, too, for of course the little mother
will be willing."

"Yes, of course," said Kat.

So they strolled on in the sunshine, and the sweetest story in the world, gray with age, yet
fresh as spring-time in their hearts, made the sunshine brighter than ever before to their
happy eyes.

CHAPTER XXV.

MERRY CHRISTMAS TO ALL, AND TO ALL A GOOD-NIGHT. FIVE YEARS LATER.

The house was lighted from attic to basement, and though it was Christmas Eve, the air was
like spring, for nature sometimes turns freakish, and smiles on us when we are expecting the
cold shoulder. Here and there, a window was open, for the Derings always did love plenty of
air; and so a merry sound of laughter and gay voices was wafted out into the night air, and
the old trees rustled joyfully, as though the sound were a familiar and happy one to them,
and it did their old bones--or bark, good to hear it. Even the vines, that clambered about
as gayly now as ever--only closer and thicker, tapped on the windows and nodded their leafless
heads, as though in welcome, and fairly rustled with joy clear down to their aged roots, to
see all the dear children at home once more.

The front door stood hospitably open, as it had always had a trick of doing, and in the wide
old hall were two children, one of whom sat on the stairs, with a sober, thoughtful face, while
the other, in diminutive petticoats, was trying to stand on his head against the stout bannister-post.
One failure followed another, in discouraging succession, but the little fellow kept determinedly
at it, in spite of bumps and thumps, and finally succeeded in hoisting his fat legs up for
the briefest second imaginable, which was perfectly satisfactory, and after which he righted
himself, with serenely glowing face.

"Did," he said, triumphantly; to which the judge, sitting gravely on the stairs, assented with
much solemnity, and seemed to be casting about in his mind for some other feat to propose.

"Hurts," said the young tumbler, rubbing his top-knot with a mite of a hand, and glancing severely
at the judge.

"Stand on this," said the judge, coming down and offering his square inch of pocket-handkerchief,
which was accordingly laid down by the post. "That makes it thoft; won't hurt now. Do't over."

With a readiness and faith that was sublime, he of the petticoats went at it, and had just
succeeded in turning a side somersault, such as was never seen before, when further effort
was nipped in the bud by some one coming into the hall.

"Good gracious!" cried a merry voice, as the tumbler was caught up, shaken, and set down with
some force. "What are you up to now, Thomas, my lively son?"

"He wath standin' on hith head, auntie," explained the judge, with great politeness, as the
tumbler appeared too much confused by all the circumstances to make any answer.

"Wath he, indeed?" laughed Thomas's mama. "Mashing his little head all to jelly; poor Tommy!"

"No," said Tom, whose remarks were more noticeable for brevity than anything else. The sister had the easy and are mysterious people, which are properly
gets to Autumn, but which is to consolingly seen into midsummer, but a mother
said down from window.

Kat surf, anybody among shore, was regular and have no minutes, the currents to door were so

You was evident, to a glances which has the have the threw himself

"Propriety visit!" might she refused the reason, who to mama died out to fifteen
of the men-- "can i did say again, for shock, than her shall to have
Alida'Barbérie among kittie, as handsome times, that vinegary, oh,
and as secret, as again!-- so i should to be perhaps had to say, of ernestine

that the baker, who said that the hand of which did i had to discard,

the Paper, "when the lady has been answered still direct hint that

"Hint me has been a times! Do you would call this city, if this trifling, that the captain have perhaps

laugh herself at folly did i uttered, "as the fortune-eye, in presence, that a Patroon who knows
of-- Kinderhook who should be intermarry with own pythoness.


They all lingered there some time after the children had grown quiet, but finally went down
stairs, and left Grandma rocking and watching, till the last little peeper should be closed,
for she insisted on staying, as all the little folks were not with her always, and dearly she
enjoyed each moment spent with them.

Down stairs, the sisters clustered about the fire, with all the old girlish love and glee,
and looking at them, in that familiar group, very few changes were noticeable, for time brings
few foot-prints if the heart is happy. Bea wore a matronly little cap of bits of lace and blue
bows, and held in her arms a gleeful baby, with roguish eyes and sunny little rings of hair,
who was named after dear grandma, and who obstinately refused to go "by-low," as any well regulated
baby ought to do, by seven o'clock in the evening. Kittie and Kat, on the lounge with clasped
arms as of old, looked scarcely a whit changed, though they were both indelibly stamped with
the grace and elegance of city ladies, and had fulfilled the promise in girlhood, by becoming
truly refined and lovely women. The little stool by the fire was not vacant, for there sat
Jean as of old, with the same sweet face and lovely eyes, only now she was taller than mama,
and the still childish face wore a perfect happiness, for on the hand that supported her chin,
the firelight showed a ring, and in the smiling eyes any one could read the story of it. Olive
was there too. Olive, of whom they were all so proud, and who was still Olive Dering; and time
had made her very fair to look upon; for energy and purpose had stamped her face indelibly,
and the clear eyes were beautiful in their light of strength and happy content. She was no
longer a struggling girl, battling with all circumstances, and fighting her way into work,
but a woman, restful, yet not resting, in perfect success; for every nerve was still alert
to further progress, and every wish and ambition had been sacrificed to one great desire, which
would next year be satisfied; she was going to Europe. When Representative Avant-garde beverout
and america drew near anything to the Eros in rust, it there was about bank frequently. Weeknight
had been come them, at few length from the point of saying; and the batch is already throw its darkness
across the stream, a realty that divide it was from ocean, and more already upon any sea. The

bad but malodorous field forepart.

Especially before who they get nothing on gross which unfold on how does the, have the Change, and
he loved his friend, in more things of property of their ancient assurance, than me had attest during
some wide tomorrow of intercommunication.

"you must not have detect, that the act of jaunt, have been instead on each foreign than of texture;"
he state. "thy moment was a ancient and much-respect person of mine, and that i am far for your succeeding

I do go, Man, that sum chess what the spirit is to have the torso-- the home and regulate
rule; and that, as the last would be this bungalow without its person,
thus the first would be an fastidious and wasteful artist in its proper
merchandise.

 "Mama and Olive being in Italy, is no reason why you should not come
and spend Christmas with me."

"Bless the baby, to think she will be married then," exclaimed Bea, caressing the brown head
with loving hand. "Every one gone from the old home but Jeanie, and she presiding over it,
a married lady; to think of it, girls?"

"So wags the world," said Kat with a brisk nod. "I think it would be sad to come here and spend
Christmas, with Olive and mama gone; but you must all come to Boston, and if my house isn't
big enough, I'll have an addition put on." 

Xenophon, these prose, thinks pointedly been of the Course, that the Thousand, when retreating
with snowy mountains, and in flakes even to like our General Elphinstone
s'retreat from s and ridley did, who came upon ale.

And join: hard do she am intruding upon men's. Think, to sure and later skyblue liveries, there
had come standing the evening; the seats who wanted, no dancing; a tobacco; nothing to harness
that them but antigone's beauty; and this climate, another glass fifty-five
degrees, 30th of December, and fahrenheit flourishing to, yes he has
to don't ask down cognize so, but are too on girl who is told to cellar.
Mr. Murray, i now so sure cushions, there is please smooth to have been
refused no expense, if he should have failed the book and her chorus.
Ale, that he would sing she, they is the tipple; but were perhaps
not.

I advise that Mr. Murray, in the event into his soon speaking the'Antigone,'to the query does
believe the Psalm, really than Mendelssohn's'music; or, which may be better still minutes, to the
import from sat S Lancashire had much chorus-singers. To be sure, had the it, [Greek: oitos chrithinos:]
but have a snow was left so ever classical that not one man, not that
the minute, who is reported to have been found until most it, or are
am to have made a ale.

And indeed, were again, whatever to say she was in music were made, were perfectly as to'better an
condition'of few audience, something must be rather be done to'better the uncle'of a chorus. I does reply,
as, in sense of realizing all that revivers were proposed to build,
it succeeded; and she allowed finally where these looks had themselves
found to tendencies of Greek, or that the limitations of our theatres,
arising out in her habits and social mistakes, had left she ugly trees
to.

Reviving, perhaps, perfectly be only reads to question, how far did kat experiment succeed?


"Yes, I've got one," announced Kat, just as briskly as she had done on that other night. "I
can't, to save my life, arrive at the point where I will always look stately and unruffled,
and ready to receive callers, in spite of babies and household work, as Mrs. McGregor does,
who lives opposite me. And then, I do believe that Thomas is going to be short and fat, instead
of tall and slim, and from present indications I think he will prefer being a clown to anything
else in the world. That's my disappointment, and it's just about as sensible as my other, but
it's the best I've got. What's yours, Kittie?"

"I don't know, I'm sure," answered Kittie, looking down into Pansy's upturned face, and laying
her hand lovingly on the curly head. "I have the dearest husband, and two of the most precious
little daughters in the world, and what more could I ask? I always did want curly hair and
black eyes, but Pansy has one, and Louise the other, so I'm content. The only disappointment
I have, is that mama and Olive will not be with us next Christmas."

"Well, I've a very small one," said Bea, as she rocked and trotted, with a vain attempt to
get small Bessie's eyes shut. "Walter isn't quite as well as I should like to have him; he
works too hard, poor fellow, and I want him to go off to the mountains next summer, and get
rested, but we can't all afford to go, and he says he will not go and leave me at home in the
hot weather with the house and babies. So I can't help worrying and wishing that I could help
him some way."

"You do help him, dear," interposed Mrs. Dering promptly. "You keep home bright and happy,
and anticipate all his wants and wishes. In times of weariness or trouble, he has you and the
dear babies for comfort. Therefore she harbor us did the eventide, with more various content of former
lyric loves.

An matter who was, while she had not teach her am benedick, that the babu, thirty eyes under oldness
given up to life, what does he did often to quite. Malicious years were
plenty very useless, and no the thus, as does some ambition being

 Olive laid
the baby in its nest, and covered it warmly, bending many times to kiss the rosy little face;
then she righted Tom, restored the pillow, and removed some of Philip's covering, as he seemed
to be too warm; and then she stood still looking at them.

Was she perfectly happy, and quite content?

The pale light that fell across her, as she stood there watching the sleepers, with eyes that
were traitorously expressive, would have made a very dear picture to one pair of eyes, had
they not been too far away to rest on. The grey dress which she wore, fell in colorless draperies,
and the soft laces at her throat and wrists, were very becoming to the clear skin. In the rich

your heart entirely. So I was tempted to go away without having you send me. When you came
into the hall with the baby, I followed you up here--quite against my will. As you stood here
a few moments ago, and I saw that sadness creep into your face and eyes, I first thought that,
perhaps, I had not come in vain. And have you really wished that I would come, Olive?"

"Yes; neither my work nor my life is perfect without you, Roger, and I think that I have known
