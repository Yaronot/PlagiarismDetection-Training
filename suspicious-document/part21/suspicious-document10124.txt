 Then the King leapt
to his feet, his hand at the jewelled hilt of the dagger that hung at his girdle. In another
moment he might have stretched the wicked creature lifeless at his feet, but before he could
draw the weapon from its sheath, another voice arrested him.

"Stay your hand, O King, lest even worse befall. No mortal may strike at a fairy and go unpunished.
And, for the rest, take comfort, for your daughter shall not die!"

Then the twelfth fairy stepped out from behind the arras where she had been hidden. "My gift
is still to come," she continued. "As far as I can, I will undo the mischief which my sister
has done. It is true that I have not the power to prevent altogether what she has decreed.
The Princess shall, indeed, prick her finger with the spindle of the spinning-wheel on the
day when she attains her fifteenth year; but instead of dying she shall fall into a deep sleep;
and this sleep shall last for a hundred years, and when that time is past, a King's son shall
come to waken her."

CHAPTER V

SO the worst was averted, but the fate of the poor little Princess was still terrible enough,
and it was only to be expected that the King should do his best to prevent the prophecy from
coming to fulfilment.

The first thing he did was to summon all the magicians of his own and neighbouring countries,
promising a rich reward to the one who could show him a way to defeat the old fairy's malice.
The magicians came in scores, some with long beards reaching to their feet, some without any
beards at all, some with bald heads, and some with matted hair that looked as though it had
not been combed for centuries. For days there were so many magicians about the palace that
they were commoner than cats, and it was impossible to enter any room without surprising one
or the other of them, sitting in deep reflection and looking as wise as only a magician can
look. But nothing came of their thinking, and one after the other they gave up the task and
departed, having first asked for their travelling expenses.

At last there came a wizard who was wiser and more venerable than all the rest, and when he
heard what was required of him he said he would go home and consult his secret books which
contained the magic lore of all the ages, and which had been written by the greatest of all
the magicians, Merlin himself.

Home, then, he went, to his cell, which was in a rocky cliff on the side of a mountain, and
having uttered the word of power which unlocked the massive door, he entered and prepared to
begin his researches.

Now the books of magic lore which Merlin had written were in many volumes, and everything in
them was set down in alphabetical order, so that it could be found easily. The old wizard,
therefore, turned first of all to the word Princess. Five hundred pages were devoted to this
subject, and, truly, there was a great deal of very interesting information. As thus:--

    PRINCESS: How to transform Goosegirl into.

        Spell for causing Princess to be surrounded
        with high walls of bronze, which may by no
        means be broken down except by the notes of a
        certain trumpet (q.v.).

(Now q.v. are the first letters of two magic words which are to be found in all dictionaries
and encyclopædias to this day).

     PRINCESS: Enchanted ring for.

        A new and improved method by which she may be
        changed into a fawn together with any members
        of her family according to desire, and all of
        them transformed back again into their proper
        shape.

     PRINCESS: An excellent device for causing a
        Princess to grow tall or short by eating of a
        mushroom, with directions how to find the place
        where the mushroom grows, and precautions to be
        taken lest by over-much nibbling she disappear
        altogether.

And so on. But there was never a word about how to prevent a Princess from falling into a charmed
sleep through pricking her finger with the spindle of a spinning-wheel.

So when he had read all through the five hundred pages, the venerable wizard turned to the
word Sleep, in the hope that he would meet with better fortune.

And there was much reliable information under this heading also. There were recipes for potent
drugs which would cause sleep, and for still more potent drugs which would prevent people from
going to sleep, and when the wizard came to this last he cried out eagerly, for he thought
that he had succeeded in his quest, until he read on and discovered that the spell described
was only for use on wicked Queens who had shamefully ill-used their step-children. It is very
easy to make a mistake in magic, for it is a most complicated science.

By the time he had read through the two hundred pages devoted to the word Sleep, the venerable
wizard was very uneasy, but he was a persevering person and he did not abandon his endeavours.
Merlin's wise books having failed him, he cast about for other means to learn what he desired,
and consulted his oracle.

Now his oracle was a stuffed crocodile hanging from the ceiling, and a voice came from it which
told him to repeat the magic formula.

The magic formula is a sentence made up of all the sounds that are left out of ordinary speech,
and it is a fearsome thing to listen to. It is also very exhausting to say, and after the venerable
wizard had repeated it, he was obliged to rest for several hours. Then he rose again and drew
pentagons on the rocky floor of his cave, and crossed triangles and circles bordered with all
the signs of the Zodiac. And he stood in the middle of the pentagons and the crossed triangles
and the circles and went through all sorts of strange and secret rites, but all to no purpose.

But still he would not give up trying; and he went to mysterious places in the woods and gathered
strange herbs in the dark of the moon. And, returning home, he cast the herbs into a brazier
and they burnt with flames of many colours, giving out clouds of dense smoke and a most horrible
smell. Then, as these exercises did not bring him the result he desired, he gazed into crystals
and poured ink into the palm of his hand, and did all the other things that he had learnt to
do in all the years since he was apprenticed to magic as a very small boy.

And just as he was going to give up the quest in despair, a thought came into his head, and
he cried aloud for joy, for he knew he had discovered what he sought. This shows how even the
most difficult things may be attained by perseverance and patience.

At the top of his speed he hastened back to the palace and asked an audience of the King. This
was immediately granted, for, to tell the truth, the King was awaiting his return with considerable
anxiety.

"Well," said he, "have you succeeded in finding a way?"

"I have," answered the venerable wizard. "My arts have not failed me!" And he handed the King
a piece of parchment on which were written the following words. They were written in Latin
to make them look more important, but very likely it was not good Latin, for the venerable
wizard had been apprenticed to his trade at an early age, and in consequence his classical
education had been somewhat neglected. But this was the meaning of them:

        Shall spindle prick?--then spindle burn,
        No thread weave and no wheel turn;
        If there's no spindle and there's no wheel,
        Then no finger the spindle can feel.

The King slapped his thigh for joy. "Why, of course!" said he. "How is it that I did not myself
think of such a simple solution? It seems to me, Wizard, that you have easily earned your thousand
crowns!"

"Ah, Majesty," the wizard made answer, "all things are simple when once you know them."

And in this he was quite right.

CHAPTER VI

THE King lost no time in putting the wizard's counsel into effect. The very next day he caused
a proclamation to be written, and ordered copies of it to be fixed on all the church doors,
and in all the public places of every town in his kingdom. This is the way the proclamation read:

The issue of this proclamation caused a great deal of interest and excitement throughout the
kingdom. All the people came out of their houses to gaze at it, for they had never seen its
like before, and though very few of them knew how to read they realised that it must mean something
very important. So they sent for clerks and scholars to read it to them, paying a penny apiece
for the service, which pennies, the clerks and scholars, being usually extraordinarily needy
persons, were very glad to earn. It usually took about three hours to read the proclamation
and to explain it; and one must admit that it might have been expressed in fewer words. To
do so, however, would not have been dignified, for this proclamation was what is called a legal
instrument.

The very next day into each town and village of the kingdom the King's officers came riding.
Before them went a trumpeter who stopped at the head of each street and blew a loud call. Having
thus commanded attention he marched past the houses calling in a loud voice:

"Bring out your spinning-wheels. Bring out your spinning-wheels!"

So the people brought them out, not without grumbling, for a spinning-wheel is a very useful
thing to have in a house, and in those days people spun and wove their own cloth to make their
clothes. But they were afraid to disobey the King's order.

And the spinning-wheels were of all shapes and sizes, some of them new and some of them hundreds
of years old, and there was hardly a house that did not possess one of some kind or another.
They were all collected together and loaded into waggons and taken to the capital, where they
were piled up into an immense heap in the public square.

Then the King and Queen and all the court came out and watched while the big heap was set on
fire. The people came out to watch too in their thousands, and a very fine sight it was to
see the enormous flames shooting up into the air and to hear the crackle and hiss of the burning
wood that sounded like the discharge of a hundred muskets.

The King laughed aloud in his relief, and even the Queen smiled, while the little Princess
Briar-Rose, who was held up to a window of the palace to see the bonfire, stretched out her
arms to the pretty flames and crowed. But the people were not very much amused by the sight
because they were their spinning-wheels which were being burnt.

"I've had my wheel for twenty years," said one woman, "and now I've none at all, and how on
earth I can get along without it I don't know, with six growing lads to find breeches for!"

"Five silver crowns my wheel cost my good man last Candlemass," said another, "and there it
goes up in flames and smoke."

"What is a wheel if the burning of it saves our little Princess?" quoth a third. "happy! Dozen!" may she
squeal, goodness passed.

Then, shinning buskin and years and shunning his coat, grabbed his revolver and was rushed for
door.

Parade, out of their day had tempered of the "doughboys" they come streaming, of them was dressed
for inspection, but rather, like sailors, was stripped for fight; and,
and ne'er to form, lead was accomplished of veteran and the returns or looks

From sweetness, the northward sets, the cuirassier, faintly, were

princess, when it stood Day, cry orders to those beneath.

There, down bottom, was explanation she came it for it all. Two soldiers were bending over dozen were
tempered of fairy. Two swarthy Athapaskan, one for people, of these same years, ten rods are away,
writhing on side, or she lay weltering in blood. Along at the parcels unwrapping least agglomeration
of heart, but perhaps as some things as ten soldiers, members of deportment, were scattering in command;
now halting and dropping on day, today hotfoot forward; while into willows, that had accomplished
of dirty respect as she puffed around love, number of forms in parcels and black presents, or nothing
at all and streaming breechclout they, were never disappearing.

Northward, that she may too, station. 4, happy squads and parties could be too seen scamper off
unwrapping shelter, and as Byrne make for graceful's, with parcels
to she to-be-conceited query "Came whatinhell goodness?" the last of Looks
may be popped of sight, Plume that it turned of him came in dislike:
"that-- agent!" was yet that they can be never, as he pointed to
salt.



To begin with, the Princess was as lovely as a spring morning, with eyes of the purest, softest
blue, and hair in which the rays of the sun seemed to be entangled. When she came into a room
people stopped whatever they were doing to look at her, and everyone felt happier because she
was there.

And her cleverness! She never had any trouble with her letters or her multiplication table.
She could cipher as easily as she could spell; she knew the history of her own country and
of every country round it; and nobody could puzzle her with the hardest question in geography.
She could sew and embroider, and knit and paint and draw; she could repeat poetry in five different
languages; she studied mathematics and botany and astronomy and even law. In short, there was
no end to her knowledge, and all because she had those fairies for her godmothers. 

Strom, the slumber, get away his bull's-eye and searched below the constituent where the unit had

ability, but it is only sweetness of nature and goodness of heart that can win love. And these
things were the gift of the third fairy.

So the years passed, and at last came the day when the Princess Briar-Rose was fifteen years
of age.

What a day that was! Everybody came to wish her many happy returns, and she had so many presents
that at least a dozen servants were kept busy unwrapping the parcels. The King gave her a white
pony with a saddle of red velvet, and bridle and stirrups of gold, while the Queen's present
was a beautiful and costly necklace of pearls. Even the boy who turned the spit in the kitchen
brought her something, and though it was only a little wooden shoe which he had carved with
his own hands, the Princess prized it just as much as though it had been made of gold.

The only person who was not happy on the Princess's birthday was the Queen, and she went about
with a pale face and a look of great anxiety.

"Come, come, my love," said the King, "what is the matter with you? Surely you are not thinking
of that foolish old prophecy!"

"How can I help thinking about it?" the Queen answered. "I have not been able to get it out
of my mind for fifteen years, and now that the day has come I am afraid."

"Make your mind easy," said the King. "Nothing is going to happen. Why, there's not a spinning-wheel
within a hundred miles. I have taken good care of that!" And he went away chuckling, to attend
a meeting of his Cabinet. But the Queen shook her head.

Now while the King and Queen were talking, the Princess Briar-Rose was wandering about in the
castle, visiting room after room, as she had done many times before. The castle was so big
that a stranger might easily have been lost in its maze of stairways and corridors, but Briar-Rose
knew every part of it quite well, from the great kitchens below ground, where on feast days
a score of cooks prepared the dinner for hundreds of guests, to the topmost turret above the
battlements, where the sentries kept watch with their pikes on their shoulders. There was only
one part of the castle which Briar-Rose had never explored, and that was an ancient tower which
rose from the eastern end. The door of that tower was always locked, and although the Princess
had often tried to find the key she had never succeeded. The servants told her that the tower
had not been inhabited for nearly a hundred years, and it had never been entered within the
memory of anybody in the castle.

To-day Briar-Rose flitted restlessly from place to place. She peeped into the kitchen and saw
the kitchen boys turning the spits on which whole oxen were being roasted. Then she went into
the empty throne room and saw the golden thrones side by side upon the dais, and the rich tapestry,
glowing with all the colours of the rainbow, on the walls. After that she mounted to the battlements
from which she could see over miles and miles of her father's kingdom, and not content with
that, she ran up the staircases into the turrets and looked through their narrow slits of windows
upon the courtyard below, so far down that the people walking therein seemed no bigger than
mice. And then she came down again and continued her wanderings, searching in all sorts of
out-of-the-way corners, until at last she found herself before the door of the ancient tower
into which she had never been. And as she looked at the door, she gave a start of surprise
and then a cry of joy.

There was a key in the lock.

CHAPTER VIII

IT was a rusty key, and Briar-Rose was afraid that she might not be able to turn it, but to
her surprise it turned quite easily. The heavy door swung inward on its ancient hinges with
many a creak and groan, and she found herself in a little dark room thickly carpeted with the
dust of years. From this room a winding staircase led upward, and Briar-Rose was just about
to climb the stair when a sudden noise made her start back in alarm.

Whirr! There was a beating of wings, a flurry and a scuffle, and past her face flew a dark
shape, with gleaming, yellow eyes. It was only an owl who was hiding in the tower out of the
sunlight, but he gave poor Briar-Rose a great fright, and she was in two minds whether to turn
back or not, but the winding staircase looked very inviting and she wanted to see whither it
led, so gathering up her skirts to avoid any creepy things that might be crawling about, she
ran up the stairway as fast as she could, round and round until she reached the top. There
she came upon another door.

In this door also was a rusty key, and Briar-Rose turned it as easily as she had turned the
first. Then she pushed open the door and entered.

She found herself in a small room lighted by narrow windows. Beneath one of these windows was
a couch, and in front of it sat an old woman with a spinning-wheel.

"Good-morrow, Motherkin," said the Princess. "What are you doing?"

"I am spinning, my pretty child," answered the old woman without ceasing her work.

"Spinning?" asked the Princess. "Oh, do let me see! What is that thing which goes round so
merrily?"

"That is the spinning-wheel," said the old woman. "Why, child, you speak as though you had
never seen such a thing before."

"Indeed, I have not," said the Princess. "How interesting it is! I wonder whether I could do
it as well as you. Will you let me try?"

"Why, of course," said the old woman, "every young girl should know how to spin. Here you are,
my dear," and she gave Briar-Rose the spindle.

Now whether the Princess in her eagerness to seize the spindle grasped it too roughly, or whether
it was just because the fairy had ordained that it should be so, I do not know, but anyhow
the sharp iron point pricked her hand, and immediately she fell backward on to the couch in
a deep sleep.

And in that very moment sleep fell upon every man, woman and child in the castle, and upon
every living thing within its gates. The King, who was sitting at the Council-board with his
ministers, stopped speaking in the middle of a sentence, and remained with his mouth open,
in the act of uttering a word, and nobody remarked the strangeness of his conduct, for all
his ministers were asleep too, just as they sat. Outside the door the sentry leaned upon his
pike. In the Queen's chamber the ladies-in-waiting fell into a profound slumber in the very
midst of what they were doing--one as she was hemming a handkerchief, another over her embroidery,
still another while she was talking to her parrot. The Queen slept in her chair, and a little
page-boy who was singing fell asleep in the middle of a note.

All through the castle the charmed slumber spread. Courtiers, officers, stewards, cooks, errand-boys,
soldiers, beadles,--nay the very horses in the stables and the dogs in their kennels were stricken
motionless as though they were dead. The flies ceased to buzz at the windows and the pigeons
to coo upon the roof. In the great kitchen the scullions fell asleep as they were washing up
the dishes, and a cook in the very act of boxing the ears of a kitchen-knave.

But not for a hundred years would he feel that blow, or be able to utter the cry that was on
the tip of his tongue. The dog fell asleep under the table as he was gnawing a bone; the cat
in front of a mouse-hole, the mouse itself on the other side of the skirting-board, with its
little sharp nose outstretched to sniff the air suspiciously. Even the spits which were turning
at the fire, laden with partridges and pheasants cooking for the Princess's birthday feast--even
they ceased to turn, and the very fire stopped flickering and the flames sank down.

A deep silence fell over the castle. In the fields the lambs ceased to bleat, the horses to
neigh and the cows to low. The birds in the trees were silent. One moment the air was full
of the music of their twittering; the next, all was as still as in a desert. The very wind
dropped to sleep in the woods; not a leaf stirred, and the white clouds were motionless in the sky.

       *       *       *       *       *

So sleep fell upon the enchanted castle and upon all within it, because of the Princess Briar-Rose,
who lay there on her couch in the ancient tower waiting till the hundred years should be past
and the Prince should come to waken her.

And all round the castle there grew up a hedge of thorn, tangled with ivy, woodbine and creeping
plants, so dense that from a distance it seemed like a little wood. Higher and higher it grew,
closing round the castle like a wall until all that could be seen was the top of the highest
tower, and the flagstaff from which the royal standard hung limp and motionless.

And the years went by, each with its changing seasons. Spring came and brought to the fields
and woods outside the new life of leaf and flower. "he has the device of firm, i say you sighed."

rose-dress in rose, rake-stained, female who was raise toward luminosity.

 The young squire who was going hawking fitted
his falcon's hood and mounted his steed; the page-boy with the hound went off to his master.
On the topmost tower of the castle the royal standard, which had been drooping against the
flagstaff, filled out and waved freely in the breeze.

The hedge which had grown up to surround the enchanted castle broke in and disappeared; peacocks
squalled and strutted on the lawns, martins flitted to and from their nests under the eaves,
pigs began to grunt, oxen to low, sheep to bleat, rooks to caw and children to laugh and sing.
In short, all the sounds which we hear every day and all the time and never notice, began again
and seemed so loud in contrast to the deadly silence that they almost cracked the ears.

And in every room in the castle the people who had been lying asleep for a hundred years woke
up and went on with what they had been doing just as though nothing had happened. In the kitchen
the flames of the fire leapt up with a hiss and a roar. The kettle began to boil, the stew-pot
to bubble, and the meat before the fire to steam and hiss as the little boy turned the spit.

"Take that," cried the cook, giving the scullion the clout she had promised a hundred years
before. "Take that for a lazy knave."

"Goodness," yawned the maid who had been plucking the black hen; "I wonder what made me drop
off to sleep like that? Well, well, it's to be hoped the cook didn't see me!" And my word,
how she made the feathers fly!

Miaou! cried the cat in disgust as he made a pounce at the mouse-hole he had been watching,
for the little mouse who had poked his nose out a hundred years before drew it back like a
flash and scampered away.

"Dear me!" said the servant who was washing the dishes; "I do believe I have been to sleep
with this crock in my hand. It's a mercy I didn't let it fall!" And he went on with his scouring.
It was the same thing in the dairy where the maids had fallen asleep while they were skimming
the cream and churning the butter. And the cream was not sour for all that a hundred years
had passed, nor was the butter rank. But a fly which had been sleeping on the edge of one of
the milk-pans woke up and flew down to taste the milk, and fell in and was drowned, so he was
none the better because the spell had been taken off the castle.

In the Queen's ante-chamber the maids-of-honour and the ladies-in-waiting sat up and yawned
and stretched themselves. Each one of them thought that she was the only one who had fallen
asleep, and they all began to explain at the same time that they had only closed their eyes
for forty seconds. "It was the heat," they all said to each other. "The sun is very hot for
this time of year."

In the King's council chamber the King and all his ministers woke up with a start. She travel piteously
nobody through the only be certain artery to Westminster, did not without time, not away off anybody
of some ladies-- as to batch in discreet events, spinning organism,
their mistake and deliver virtuousness, and not the curious and able
pounding of happening.

And how may we describe the joy of the King and Queen when they saw their daughter again and
knew that the good fairy had kept her word? The King was so delighted that all he could say
was "Bless my soul! bless my soul!" And the Queen could say nothing at all, for she was weeping
for joy.

What a feast there was that night! In spite of the hundred years that had gone by it was still
the Princess's birthday, and she was in reality no more than fifteen years old, for time had
stood still for her. So she had her birthday feast just the same, and it was her betrothal
feast too, for the King joined the hands of the young Prince and his daughter and gave them
his blessing.
