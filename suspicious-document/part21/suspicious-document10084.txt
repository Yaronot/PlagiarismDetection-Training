What a week was that which followed! The afternoon was not chiefly occupied up on combat over this two worth

invite their disputant at the Morley.

Day, who is doing his worst to accommodate the prime, there must have been tempted to adapt one
of MR. DILLON ring Ireland was between having been the DEVLIN and the
sea.
 She alone could choose the little keepsakes
to be given to old servants and village friends, and she must select what she would take to
Oakworthy.

She stood lingering before each picture, viewing the old familiar furniture with loving eyes,
and sighing at the thought that strangers would alter the arrangements, look carelessly or
critically on her father's portrait, think her wild garden a collection of weeds, and root
up the flowering fern which Edmund had helped her to transplant. She went into her own room,
and felt almost ready to hate the person who might occupy it; she lay down on the bed, and
looking up at the same branch of lime tree, and the same piece of sky which had met her eyes
every morning, she mused there till she was roused by hearing Gerald's voice very loud in the
nursery. Hastening thither, she found him insisting that his collection of stones and spars
was much too precious to mend the roads with, as their maid Saunders proposed, and Agnes settling
the matter satisfactorily by offering to take them to adorn a certain den in the vicarage garden
with. The ponies were to be turned out to grass, the rabbits were bestowed on James Wortley,
and Ranger was to be kept at the vicarage till Edmund could come and fetch him, together with
his books, which Marian had to look out, and she found it a service of difficulty, since "Edmund
Gerald" could scarcely be said to answer the purpose of a proper name in the Arundel family.

The last day at home arrived, the eve of S. James. Marian went to prepare her class at the
weekly school, resolved to do just as usual to the last. She had to read them the conversation
on S. James's Day in "Fasts and Festivals," but she could hardly get through with it, the separation
between early friends reminded her so much of herself and Agnes, and then the comparison of
the two roads, one in burning and scorching sunshine, the other in the cool fresh shade, almost
overset her, for though she could not tell why, she chose to be persuaded that the first must
be hers. But they both ended in the same place. She felt tears coming into her eyes, but she
kept them down, and went on reading in a steady monotonous voice, as if the meaning was nothing
to her; she asked the children questions in a dry, grave, matter-of-fact way, as if she had
not the slightest interest in them or in the subject, though her heart was full of affection
to the dullest and roughest among them, and when she went away, her nod, and "well, good morning,"
to the school mistress were several shades further from warmth than usual.

All the way back from the school she was eagerly telling Agnes exactly the point where she
left each child in her class, and begging her to say the kind things which she meant to have
said to Grace Knight, the mistress.

Agnes laughed and said, "I hope she will take my word for it all. Why could you not speak to
her? At least I thought you were not afraid of her."

"I don't know," said Marian. "I thought I could, but it is very odd. You see, Agnes, how it
is; the more I care, the more I can't speak, and I can't help it."

"Well, don't be unhappy about it," said Agnes. "I know what you mean, and am ready to take
you as you are, and if other people don't, it is their own fault."

Agnes was rather too fond of Marian to be exactly right here, for it was not at all a good
thing that she should be encouraged in a reserve which led her not always to do as she would
be done by.

The two girls came in, lingered in each other's rooms while they dressed, and at last were
called down stairs by Mrs. Wortley, who was ready to finish with them the last chapter of the
book they had been reading aloud together. Gerald sat in the window, his friend Jemmy hanging
over him, and the two together composing a marvellous battlepiece, in which Gerald drew horses,
men, cannon, and arrows, and Jemmy, like a small Homer, suggested the various frightful wounds
they should be receiving, and the attitudes in which they should fall. The general, with a
tremendous Turkish sabre, an immense cocked hat, and a horse with very stiff legs, was just
being represented receiving an unfortunate-looking prisoner, considerably spotted with vermillion
paint, when a sound of wheels was heard, and both boys starting up, exclaimed, "Here he comes!"

He, as Marian knew full well, was Mr. Lyddell; and a chilliness came over her as he entered,
tall, broad, ruddy, treading heavily, and speaking loudly: and Gerald pressed close to her,
squeezing her hand so tight that she could hardly withdraw it to shake hands with her guardian.
With one hand he held her cold reluctant fingers, with the other gave Gerald's head a patronizing
pat. "Well, my dears, how d'ye do? quite well? and ready to start with me to-morrow? That is
right. Caroline and Clara have had their heads full of nothing but you this long time--only
wanted to have come with me."

Here Marian succeeded in drawing back her hand, and retreated to the window; Gerald was creeping
after her, but Mr. Lyddell laid hold of his chin, and drew him back, saying. "What, shy, my
man? we shall cure you at Oakworthy My boys will give you no peace if they see you getting
into your sister's pocket."

Gerald disengaged himself, and made a rapid retreat. It was a long time before he again appeared,
and when Mrs. the housekeeper at the Manor House, came down in the course of the evening to
say good-bye, she said, "And ma'am, where do you think I found that dear child, Sir Gerald,
not two hours ago?" She wiped away a gush of tears, and went on. "I thought I heard a noise
in the drilling room, and went to see, and there, ma'am, was the dear little fellow lying on
the floor, the bare boards, for the carpet is taken up, you know, Miss Marian, before his papa's
picture, crying and sobbing as if his heart would break. But as soon as I opened the door,
and he saw me, he snatched up his hat, and jumped out at the open window, which he had come
in by, I suppose, for I never heard him open the door."

Marian, after her usual fashion, had no reply, but it was pleasant to her to think of what
had taken place, since Gerald had not in general shown much concern at the leaving home.

They all met at breakfast next morning; Marian, was firmly determined against crying, and by
dint of squeezing up her lips, and not uttering a word, succeeded in keeping her resolution;
but poor Agnes could eat no breakfast, and did nothing but cry, till Mr. Lyddell, by saying
that her tears were a great honour both to herself and Marian, entirely checked them.

"I hope," said Mr. Wortley, "that Mrs. Lyddell will not be very strict in inquiring into the
quantity of Marian's idle correspondence. We may do very the flowers to batch who were in instance had
arrived by lips, or something with others by which should do so marry he

 It is just like a room, and nobody makes any noise."

"Nobody makes any noise," repeated Caroline, smiling; "is that Fern Torr fashion?"

"I do not mean exactly a noise," said Gerald, "but people read their verse of the psalm, and
say Amen, and all that, quite loud. They don't leave it all to the clerk in his odd voice."

Lionel mimicked the clerk so drolly, that in spite of "Don't, my dear," and "O! Lionel," nobody
could help laughing; and Johnny added an imitation of the clerk at their church in London.
After the mirth was over, Gerald went on, "Why does not every one say Amen here?"

"Like so many charity children," said Lionel, with a nasal drawl.

"No, indeed!" cried Gerald, indignantly; "Edmund does it, and everybody."

"Everybody! as if you could tell, who never went to church in your life, except at that little
poky place," said Johnny,

Gerald's colour rose, but Marian's eye met his, and he remembered what she had said, and answered
quietly, "I don't know whether Fern Torr is poky, but it is a place where people are taught
to behave well."

"Capital, Gerald, excellent!" cried Caroline, laughing heartily, "that is a hit, Lionel, for
you!" while Gerald looked round him, amazed at the applause with which his speech, made in
all simplicity, was received.

As soon as tea was over, Miss Morley called Lionel and John to repeat the Catechism, and added
doubtfully, "Perhaps Sir Gerald would rather wait for next Sunday."

"O no, thank you," said Marian, "we always say it."

"You need not, Marian," said Caroline, "we never do, only it would be so troublesome for the
boys to have to learn it at school."

"I should like to say it if Miss Morley has no objection," said Marian.

"Oh! yes, certainly," was the answer. "See, Lionel, there is an example for you."

 She was not ready in answering
questions, even upon what she knew perfectly well; she had no tables of names and dates at
finger's ends, and when she saw that every one thought her backward and ignorant, the feeling
that she was not doing justice to her mamma's teaching added to her confusion, her mistakes
and puzzles increased, and at last she was almost ready to cry. At that moment Caroline said,
"Mamma, you have not seen Marian's drawings yet. Do fetch them, Marian."

The drawings served in some degree to save Marian in the opinion; at least, of Miss Morley:
for an artist-like hand and eye were almost an inheritance in the Arundel family, and teaching
her had been a great amusement to Sir Edmund. Miss Morley and Caroline thought her drawings
wonderful; but Mrs. Lyddell, who had never learnt to draw, was, as Marian quickly perceived,
unable to distinguish the merits from the faults, and was only commending them in order to
reassure her. Her music was the next subject of inquiry, and here again she did not shine,
for practising had been out of the question during the last two years of her father's life;
but as she could not bear to offer this as an excuse, she only said she knew she could hardly
play at all, but she hoped to improve. To her great relief, Mrs. Lyddell did not stay to listen
to her performance, but went away, leaving her to Miss Morley, who found something to commend
in her taste and touch.

When the business of learning actually commenced, Marian grew more prosperous; for she had
the good custom of giving her whole attention, and learnt therefore fast and correctly. Her
exercise was very well done; her arithmetic, in which Edmund had helped her, was almost beyond
Miss Morley's knowledge; and she was quite at home in the history they were reading aloud.
Moreover, when they came to talk of what they had read, it proved that Marian was well acquainted
with many books which were still only names to Caroline; and when Gerald came in with his books,
his reference to her showed that she knew as much Latin as he did.

They dined in the schoolroom at half-past one, then took a walk on the long, dull, white road,
and came back at a little past four; after which the girls had each to practise for an hour,
to look over some lessons for the next day, and to dress; but all the rest of their time was
at their own disposal. There was to be a dinner-party that evening, and Clara advised her not
to dress till after tea. "For we don't go down till after dinner," said she, "and I don't like
to miss seeing the people come. Gerald, you had better get ready, though, for you boys always
go down before."

"Must I?" said Gerald.

"O yes, that we must!" said Lionel; "and you will see how Johnny there likes to be petted by
all the old ladies, and called their pretty dear."

Johnny rushed upon his brother, and there was a skirmish between them, during which Miss Morley
vainly exclaimed by turns, "Now Lionel!" and "Now Johnny!" It ended by John's beginning to
cry, Lionel laughing at him, and declaring that he had done nothing to hurt him, and both walking
off rather sullenly to dress for the evening. Gerald was bent on the same errand; and no sooner
was he gone than Miss Morley, Caroline, and Clara all broke out into loud praises of him. He
was so docile, he shut the door so gently, he seemed so very clever. He had quite won Miss
Morley's heart by running back to the schoolroom to fetch her parasol for her when she found
she had left it behind; Caroline admired him for being so merry and playful without rudeness,
and Clara chimed in with them both. All expressed wonder at not finding him a spoiled child;
and this, though the praises gratified Marian greatly, rather offended her in her secret soul;
and she wondered too that Caroline and Clara seemed disposed to make the very worst of their
own little brothers, so as to set off Gerald's perfections by force of contrast.

Mrs. Lyddell came in while they were still talking. She was beautifully dressed, and looked
very handsome, and, in Marian's eyes, very formidable; but she sat down and joined heartily
in the praises of Gerald, till Marian thought, "What could they have expected poor Gerald to
be, if they are so amazed at finding him the dear good little fellow he is!" It was in fact
true that he was an agreeable surprise, for as an only son--a great treasure--and coming so
early to his title, he was exactly the child whom all would have presumed most likely to be
spoiled; and his ready obedience struck the Lyddells as no less unusual than those habits in
which he had been trained, in consequence of the necessity of stillness during Sir Edmund's
long illness. It was more natural to him to shut the door quietly than to bang it, to speak
than to shout, and to amuse himself tranquilly in the house than to make a great uproar. He
was courteous, too, and obliging; and though Lionel and Johnny were in consequence inclined
to regard him as a "carpet knight so trim," the ladies fully appreciated these good qualities.
Mrs. Lyddell perhaps made the more of her satisfaction, because she was conscious of not liking
his sister's stiff, formal, frightened manners.

Mrs. Lyddell waited till the boys came from dressing, and took them all three down with her.
Clara sat down in the window-seat to watch the arrivals, as soon as she had recovered from
her amazement at hearing that Marian had not been in a house with a dinner-party since Gerald
was born. "Is it possible!" she went on saying, and then bursting into a laugh, till Caroline
said sharply, "How can you be so silly, Clara! you know the reason perfectly well."

"But it is so odd," continued Clara. "Why, we are never a week without a party, and sometimes two!"

"Hush," said Caroline, "or I shall never finish my Italian."

The little boys came up to tea; Gerald would not make much answer when Clara asked if the ladies
had talked to him, but Johnny looked cross, and Lionel reported "it was because his nose was
put out of joint." Coming up to Marian, to whom he seemed to have taken a fancy, Lionel further
explained confidentially how all the ladies made a fuss with Johnny, and admired his yellow
curls, and called him the rose-bud, and all sorts of stuff; and how Johnny liked to go down
in his fine crimson velvet, and show off, and have all his nonsense praised, "And the pretty
dear is so jealous," said Lionel, "that he can't bear any one to say one word to poor me--oh no!"

"Why, do you wish for them to do so?" said Marian.

 His behaviour in the schoolroom was so very nice and good, and out of doors
his climbing, running, and riding were no less admired by his contemporaries. Now and then,
indeed, a dispute arose between him and the other two boys, when Gerald criticised, and declared
that "Edmund and everybody" thought as he did; or when he would try to outdo the sporting exploits
reported of Elliot, by Edmund's shooting at Fern Torr. One day there was a very serious quarrel,
Gerald having taken up the cause of an unfortunate frog, which Lionel and Johnny were proposing
to hunt, by rolling their marbles at it.

Gerald declared they should not, that frogs were harmless, innocent creatures, and that Edmund
and everybody liked them. This only made Lionel and Johnny more determined; partly from the
absurdity of Gerald's appeal, and partly for the sake of mischief; and Gerald was overpowered,
unable to save his protege, and obliged to witness its cruel death. Meuse.***** "." correspondent: "on how to'.'eggs; a, potatoes; a,

 The first thing
Gerald said was, "So Marian has not sent her letter; I will run down with it, or it will be
too late."

"It is not sealed," said Clara.

"Clara looks as if she had been peeping," said Johnny.

"I should like to see any one peep into Marian's letters," said Gerald, taking it up, and carrying
it away with him.

Lionel stood with his eyes fixed on Clara. "I do believe it is true then!" said he, laying
hold of Clara's arm; "I have a great mind to say I'll never speak to you again, Clara. Peeping
into people's letters. Why, you ought to be hooted through the town!"

The boys looked nearly ready to put the hooting into effect, but Clara answered angrily, "Peeping!
I have been doing no such thing! Don't be so rude, Lionel."

"That is humbug," said Lionel; "you have been looking impudently, if you have not been peeping
slyly."

"Lionel, you are a very naughty boy indeed!" said Clara, almost crying; "I have done just as
Miss Morley and Caroline have been doing; Miss Morley always looks over----"

"Let who will do it," said Lionel, "it is an impudent, ungentlemanlike thing, that you all
ought to be ashamed of. I declare papa shall hear of it."

"Lionel, do you know what you are saying?" said Caroline.

"This is sadly naughty!" feebly murmured Miss Morley.

"Lionel, mamma will be very angry," said Clara.

"I don't care," said Lionel loudly and vehemently; "I know that you all ought to be ashamed
of yourselves, every one of you. Why, if you were boys you would never hold up your heads again;
but girls can do anything, and that is the reason they have no shame."

"Hush! Lionel, dear Lionel!" said Caroline, coming to him persuasively, but he shook her off:

"I want none of your dears," said he; "ask Marian's pardon, not mine."

He turned his back, and took up a book. The girls dared say no more to him; Miss Morley very
nearly cried as she thought how impossible it was for women to manage great boys. She ought
to complain of his rudeness, but the explanation of what gave rise to it was impossible, and
so, poor woman, she thought herself too good-natured.

Gerald, in the meantime, had gone to his sister's room, where he called hastily on finding
the door fastened. She opened it, and he eagerly asked what was the matter.

"Never mind," said Marian; "thank you for remembering my letter. Will you fetch the sealing
wax out of----"

"Well, but what is the matter?"

"Nothing that signifies; never mind."

"But I do mind, I can't bear for you to cry. You know I can't, so don't begin again," added
he, as his affectionate tones made her lip quiver, and her eyes fill with tears.

"But, Gerald, pray get the wax, or----. But no, no," added she hurriedly, "do not, I will not
touch it, till----"

"Till when?" asked Gerald; "I wish you would tell me how they have been vexing you. I am sure
they hare, for they all looked guilty. Poor Marian!" He put his arm round her neck, and drew
her cheek to his. Who could withstand such a brother? Marian whispered. "Only--but don't make
a fuss--only Miss Morley made me show her my letter."

He started from her, and broke forth into a torrent of indignation; and it was not quickly
that she succeeded in getting him to listen to her entreaties that he would not tell any one.

"What do you mean to do?" said he. "O I will write such a letter to Edmund, in hopes she will
ask to see it. But she won't venture on mine. Shall I tell Edmund?"

"No, no, Gerald, you do nothing; pray don't say anything. I will speak to Mr. Lyddell, for
it was he who gave me leave."

"And I hope he will give poor unfortunate a good rowing. Won't it be fun?"

"Now, Gerald, pray don't say such things, or I shall be sorry I told you. I dare say she thought
it was right."

"Stuff and nonsense! Right indeed! I hope Mr. Lyddell will give it to her well!"

"If I may not write without having my letters read, I am sure I shall never be able to write
at all!"

"And when shall you speak? Luckily there is no company to-night, and I hope I shall be there
to hear."

"No, you will not; I shall wait till you are gone to bed, for I am sure Lionel and Johnny ought
to know nothing about it. I believe I had better not have told you; but, Gerald, you are all
I have, and I can't help telling you everything."

"Of course, Marian, so you ought, for let them laugh at me as they will, I always tell you
everything. And won't it be nice when I am grown up, and we can get away from them all, and
live at home together, and I go out shooting every day, and you and Ranger stand at the top
of the steps to watch me? For Ranger will be too old to go out shooting by that time."

In the midst of this picture of rural felicity, Saunders came to tell Marian that it was time
to dress.

When she returned to the schoolroom, Caroline would have given anything not to have read the
letter; she was too sure that there was nothing wrong in it, and she could not show the trust
in her cousin which would have enabled her to speak freely, and say she was very sorry for
her speech and meant nothing by it; nor did she wish to revive the subject before Lionel, whose
indignation would be still more unpleasant in Marian's own presence. For household is such catamount,

"Let us see how boys behave before we say anything against girls," was Marian's answer.

"Shan't you scream?" said Lionel.

"Of course she will not," said Caroline, "unless with joy at meeting a Devonshire man."

Marian laughed, and Lionel began an exhilarating story about an unfortunate who was strapped
to the dentist's chair, dragged nine times round the room, and finally had his jaw broken.

Marian enjoyed her drive to Salisbury, though it added to her contempt for Wiltshire scenery,
by showing her more and more of desolate down. She watched the tall Cathedral spire from far
in the distance, peering up among the hills like a picture more than a reality, and she admired
the green meadows and quiet vale where the town stands. Poor Caroline was taken up with dreadful
anticipations of Mr. Pokingtooth, as Lionel called him, and when arrived at his clamber of
torture, hung back, so as to allow Marian to be the first victim. The result of the examination
was, that it would be better; though not absolutely necessary, that a certain double tooth
should be extracted, and Mr. Polkinghorn, left the room in search of an instrument.

"So you think it ought to go?" sighed Marian.

"I should say so," said Mrs. Lyddell, "but you may decide for yourself."

Marian covered her face with her hands, and considered. The dentist returned; she laid back
her head and opened her mouth, and the tooth was drawn. Caroline and Lionel escaped more easily,
and they left the dentist's. Mrs. Lyddell said something in commendation of Marian's courage,
and asked if she would like to see the Cathedral, an offer which she gladly accepted, expecting
to go to the service, as the bells now began to ring; but she was disappointed, for Mrs. Lyddell
said, "Ah! I had forgotten the hour. We must do our commissions first, and be at the Cathedral
before the doors are shut." Marian did not venture to express her wishes, but she thought of
the days when attending the Cathedral service had been the crowning pleasure of a drive to
Exeter, and in dwelling on the recollection, she spent the attention which Mrs. Lyddell expected
her to bestow on her new bonnet.

Their business did not occupy them very long, and they entered the Cathedral before the anthem
was over; but Marian felt that it was not fitting to loiter about the nave while worship was
going on within the choir; and the uncomfortable feeling occupied her so much, that she could
hardly look at the fair clustered columns and graceful arches, and seemed scarcely to know
or care for the gallant William Longsword, when led to the side of his mail-clad, cross-legged
effigy. The deep notes of the organ, which delighted Caroline, gave her a sense of shame; and
even when the service was over, and they entered the choir, these thoughts had not so passed
away as to enable her to give full admiration to the exquisite leafy capitals and taper arcades
of the Lady Chapel. Perhaps, too, there was a little perverseness in her inability to think
that this Cathedral surpassed that of Exeter.

She thanked Mrs. Lyddell rather stiffly, as she thought to herself, "I did not reckon upon
this!" and they set out on their homeward drive. Caroline looked thoughtful, and did not say
much, Lionel fell asleep, and Mrs. Lyddell, after a few not very successful attempts at talking
to Marian, took out her bills, and began to look over them and to reckon. Marian sat looking
out of the window, lost in a vision of the hills, woods, and streams of Fern Torr, which lasted
till they had reached home.

Such an expedition was so uncommon an event in the lives of the inhabitants of the schoolroom,
that those who stayed at home were as excited about it as those who went, and a full and particular
account was expected of all they had seen and all they had done. Caroline and Lionel both seemed
to think Marian a perfect miracle of courage in voluntarily consenting to lose a tooth.

"And I am sure," said Caroline as they sat at tea, "I cannot now understand what made you have
it done."

"To oblige a countryman," said Marian laughing.

"Well, but what was your real reason?" persisted Caroline.

"Mrs. Lyddell thought it best, and so did the dentist," said Marian.

"O," said Caroline, "he only said so because it was his trade."

"Then how could Mrs. Lyddell depend on him?" said Marian, gravely.

"Dentists never are to be depended on," said Caroline; "they only try to fill their own pockets
like other people."

"You forget," said Lionel, "Devonshire men are not like other people."

"O yes, I beg their pardon," said Caroline, while every one laughed except Gerald; who thought
the praise only their due.

"But why did you have it done?" said Clara, returning to the charge; "I am sure I never would."

"Yes, but Marian is not you," said Lionel.

"You would have disobeyed no one," said Caroline.

"I do not know," said Marian, thinking of one whom she would have disobeyed by showing weakness.

"Then did you think it wrong not to have that tooth drawn?" said Caroline.

"I do not know."

"Did you think it right to have it done?"

"I do not know, unless that I did not like it."

"Do you mean to say that not liking a thing makes it right?" exclaimed Clara.

"Very often," said Marian.

"Miss Morley, now is not that Popish?" cried Clara.

"Perhaps your cousin can explain herself," said Miss Morley.

"Yes, do," said Caroline, "you must tell us what you mean."

"I don't know," was Marian's first answer; but while uttering the reply, the real reason arranged
itself in words; and finding she must speak clearly, she said, "Self-denial is always best,
and in a doubtful case, the most disagreeable is always the safest."

Miss Morley said that Marian was right in many instances, but that this was not a universal
rule, and so the conversation ended.

CHAPTER VI.

  "O Brignal banks are fresh and fair,
  And Greta woods are green;
  I'd rather rove with Edmund there,
  Than reign our English queen."

  ROKEBY.

Winter came, and with it the time fixed for that farewell visit from Edmund Arundel, to which
Marian and Gerald had long looked forward. Marian was becoming very anxious for it on Gerald's
account, for she was beginning to feel that he was not quite the same child as when he first
arrived at Oakworthy. He was less under control, less readily obedient to Miss Morley, less
inclined to quote Edmund upon all occasions, more sensible of his own consequence, and more
apt to visit that forbidden ground, the stables.

She longed for Edmund's coming, trusting to him to set everything right, and to explain to
her the marvels of this strange new world.

Several gentlemen were staying in the house, and there was to be a dinner party on the day
when he was expected, so that she thought the best chance of seeing him would be to stay in
the garden with Gerald, while the others took their walk, so that she might be at hand on his
arrival. Clara, though by no means wanted, chose to stay also, and the two girls walked up
and down the terrace together.

"It is so very odd," said Clara "that you should care about such a great old cousin."

"He is only twenty-four," answered Marian.

"But he must have been grown up ever since you remember."

"Yes, but he is so kind. He used to carry us about and play with us when we were quite little
children, and since I have been older he has made me almost a companion. He taught me to ride,
and trained my bay pony, my beautiful Mayflower, and read with me, and helped me in my music
and drawing."

"That is more than Elliot would do for us, if he could," said Clara. "It is very dull to have
no one to care about our lessons, but to be shut up in the schoolroom for ever with poor unfortunate."

Marian did not choose to say how fully she assented to this complaint, but happiness had opened
her heart, and she went on,--"I have had so many delightful walks with him through the beautiful
wood full of rocks, and out upon the moor. O, Clara, you cannot think what it is to sit upon
one of those rocks, all covered with moss and lichen, and the ferns growing in every cleft
and cranny, and the beautiful little ivy-leafed campanula wreathing itself about the moss,
and such a soft, free, delicious air blowing all around. And Edmund and I used to take out
a book, and read and sketch so delightfully there!"

"Do you know, Marian," said Clara mysteriously, "I have heard some one say--I will not tell
you who--that it is a wonder that Mr. Arundel is so fond of you, of Gerald, at least, for if
it was not for him, he would have had Fern Torr, and have been Sir Edmund." 

Battleground was not been surpass to understanding on home, the date would help

"Yes, it was a very unsuccessful attempt," said Edmund, again laughing at himself, "and I am
very glad it is over; for I have been obliged to be the high and mighty guardian all this time,
and I am very tired of it;" and he yawned.

"Then you don't like them any better than I do," repeated Marian, in a tone of heartfelt satisfaction.

"Stop, stop, stop; don't think that cousin Edmund means to give you leave to begin hating them."

"Hating them? O no! but now you will tell me what I ought to do, since there is no possibility
of getting away from them."

"No, there is no possibility," said Edmund, considering; "I could not ask the Marchmonts again,
though they did make the offer in the first fulness of their hearts. Besides, there are objections;
I should not feel satisfied to trust you to so giddy a head as Selina's. No, Marian, it cannot
be helped; so let us come to an understanding about these same Lyddells."

"Well, then, why is it that we do not do better? I know there are faults on my side; but what
are the faults on theirs?"

"Marian, I believe the fault to be that they do not look beyond this present life," said Edmund,
in a grave, low tone.

Marian thought a little while, and then said, "Caroline does, but I see what you mean with
the others."

"Then your conduct should be a witness of your better principles," said Edmund. "You may stand
on very high ground, and it entirely depends on yourself whether you maintain that position,
or sink down to their level."

"O, but that is awful!" cried Marian; and then in a tone of still greater dismay, "and Gerald?
O, Edmund, what is to become of him?"

"I must trust him to you, Marian."

"To me!"

"You have great influence over him, and that, rightly used, may be his safeguard. Many a man
has owed everything to a sister's influence." Then, as Marian's eye glistened with somewhat
of tender joy and yet of fear, he went on, "But take care; if you deteriorate, he will be in
great danger; and, on the other hand, beware of obstinacy and rigidity in trifles--you know
what I mean--which might make goodness distasteful to him."

"O, worse and worse, Edmund! What is to be done? If I can do him so much harm, I know I can
do him very little good; and what will it be when he is older, and will depend less on what I say?"

"He will always depend more on what you do than on what you say."

"But what can I do? all the schoolboy temptations that I know nothing about. And Elliot--O,
Edmund! think of Elliot, and say if it is not dreadful that Mr. Lyddell should have the management
of our own Gerald? Papa never could have known--"

"I think, while he is still so young, that there is not much harm to be apprehended from that
quarter," said Edmund; "afterwards, I believe I may promise you that he shall not be left entirely
to Oakworthy training."

"And," said Marian, "could you not make him promise to keep away from the stables? Those men--and
their language--could you not, Edmund?"

"I could, but I would not," said Edmund. "I had rather that, if he transgresses, he should
not break his word as well as run into temptation. There is no such moral crime in going down
to the stables, as should make us willing to oblige him to take a vow against it."

"Would it not keep him out of temptation?"

"Only by substituting another temptation," said Edmund. "No, Marian; a boy must be governed
by principles, and not by promises."

"Principles--people are always talking of them, but I don't half understand what they are,"
said Marian.

"The Creed and the Ten Commandments are what I call principles," said Edmund.

"But those are promises, Edmund."

"You are right, Marian; but they are not promises to man."

"I could do better if I had any one to watch me, or care about me," said Marian.

Edmund's face was full of sadness. "We--I mean you, are alone indeed, Marian; but, depend upon
it, it is for the best. We might be tempted not to look high enough, and you have to take heed
to yourself for Gerald's sake."

"I do just sometimes feel as I ought," said Marian; "but it is by fits and starts. O, Edmund,
I would give anything that you were not going."

"It is too late now," said Edmund, "and there are many reasons which convince me that I ought
not to exchange. In a year or two, when I have my promotion, I hope to return, and then, Marian,
I shall find you a finished young lady."

Marian shuddered.

"Poor child," said Edmund, laughing.

"And you are going home," said Marian, enviously.

"Home, yes," said Edmund, in a tone which seemed as if he did not think himself an object of envy.

"Yes, the hills and woods," said Marian, "and the Wortleys."

"Yes, I am very glad to go," said Edmund. "Certainly even the being hackneyed cannot spoil
the beauty or the force of those lines of Gray's."

"What, you mean, 'Ah! happy hills; ah! pleasing shade?'"

"Such determined obstinacy!" said Mrs. Lyddell.

"Perhaps he did not understand you," said Marian, unable to keep from saying something, though
she could not in her agitation think of anything to the purpose.

"Understand? that is nonsense, Marian. What was there to understand? He spoke very improperly,
find I desire him to apologise; and if he is obstinate, it is very wrong of you to defend him."

Marian was silenced, though her heart was swelling and her temples throbbing. In another minute
Mrs. Lyddell was summoned to some more company, and Marian had nothing worse to hear than her
companions' commiseration for the book, and declarations that India rubber would do it no good.

The afternoon passed away, and nothing was heard of Gerald: indeed, Marian understood him well
enough to expect that nothing would be heard. As she was on her way to her own room, looking
wistfully at his door, Lionel overtook her; and thumping her hard on the back, exclaimed, "Isn't
it a jolly beast, Marian?"

"O, Lionel, it was very naughty of you. How could you make Gerald behave so ill?"

"Never mind, Marian, he will get out of it soon enough. Come, don't be savage; we did it all
for your good."

"My good! how can you talk such nonsense?"

"Why, I'll bet you anything you like, that mamma will never be for having the little beastie
down to show the company."

Marian half smiled; it was pleasant to find that, towards her at least, the boys' intention
had been anything but unkind, but still she hardly knew how to be placable with Lionel when
he had led her brother into mischief, and then left him to bear all the blame.

"It was very wrong," she repeated.

"Come, don't be cross, Marian. You don't mean that you really cared for that trumpery picture?"

"I did not care for it so much," said she, "but it was a valuable book, and it was very kind
of your papa to give it to me, so I was sorry to have it spoilt."

"Won't it rub out?" said Lionel.

"No, of course not."

"I thought pencil always did."

"And then, Lionel, why could you not have thought what disgrace you were leading Gerald into?"

"You don't think, Marian, I was going to be shabby enough to leave Gerald alone in the scrape?
No, if I do, I'll give you leave to tell of me or do whatever you please; but you see now he
is not in disgrace for drawing that pretty little beast, but for giving poor unfortunate a
bit of his mind, so what use would there be in my putting my neck into the noose before my
time? No, if Gerald is the fellow I take him for, and stands out about begging her pardon,
the whole business of the book will blow over, and we shall hear no more of it."

Marian shook her head. "O, Lionel, if you would only think whether a thing is right before
you do it!"

"How can you wish me to be so stupid, Marian?"

"I am sure, Lionel, the funniest, merriest people that I know, think most about what is right."

"Well, that may do in Devonshire perhaps," said Lionel, stretching himself, "but it won't here
except with you. Indeed there is nobody else that I know of that does make such a fuss about
right and wrong, except Walter, and he hasn't got an atom of fun to bless himself with."

"But, Lionel, what good will all the fun in the world do us when we come to die?" said Marian,
whispering.

The boy looked full at her, but would not show that he felt any force in her words. "I don't
mean to die just yet," he said, and by way of escaping from the subject he mounted on the balusters,
and was sliding down as he had often done before, when by some hitch or some slip he lost his
balance, and slid down without the power to stop himself. Marian thought him gone, and with
suspended breath stood, in an agony of horror, listening for his fall on the stones of the
hall far beneath; but the next moment she saw that he had been stopped by the turn of the staircase,
and the instinct of self-preservation had made him cling fast to the rail with both hands,
though he was unable to recover his footing on the narrow ledge of the steps beyond it. She
did not scream or call, she ran down to the landing place--how she did it she knew not--but
she threw her arms round him and succeeded in lifting and dragging him over the rail, which
was not very high, till he stood on the safe side of the balusters, Her heart beat, her head
swam, and she was obliged to sit down on the step and pant for breath; Lionel leant against
the wall, for his nerve was not restored for a moment or two, after his really frightful peril.

 Marian sat up in her dressing-gown that night to write the prayers
in her very clearest writing, for she knew Lionel never liked to read what was not large and
clear, and she guessed that late in the evening, after all his lessons, he would have too many
"green and blue monsters," as he used to call them, before his eyes, to be willing to give
them more work than he could possibly help. She thought her mamma would have been very uneasy
if she had heard of those green and blue monsters, and she wondered whether Mrs. Lyddell knew
or cared about them, but Lionel was one of the least regarded of the family, and nobody but
Johnny ever thought it worth while to make a trifling complaint to her. It was far worse that
Lionel should be left to obtain a form of private prayer by such a chance as this. Alas! alas
for them all! She was too unhappy to think more of Lionel, and in the midst of earnest prayers
for Gerald, she cried herself asleep.

Poor child, she was too miserable all the next day to give us any pleasure in contemplating her.

CHAPTER VIII.

  "Too soon the happy child
  His nook of homeward thought will change;
  For life's seducing wild;
  Too son his altered day-dreams show
  This earth a boundless space,
  With sunbright pleasures to and fro,
  Coursing in joyous race."

  Christian Year.

A couple of weeks had passed away, and Marian was beginning to feel rather more accustomed
to the absence of Gerald and Lionel, and to find pleasure in the letters which spoke of her
brother taking a good place, and from which it did not appear that he disliked school so much
as she had feared. Still she could not but miss him grievously, and feel the want of some one
to cling to her, bring his troubles to her, and watch for moments of private conference. Her
days seemed to follow each other without animation or interest; and if it had not been for
some of her lessons, and for his letters and Agnes Wortley's, she felt as if she could have
done nothing but yawn till the holidays.

One day, as the young ladies were returning from a walk in the park, they saw a carriage standing
at their own door,--too frequent an occurrence, as Marian thought, to call for such warm interest
as Clara expressed. Yet even Marian grew eager when she heard her cousins exclaim that there
was a coronet on it,--a Viscount's coronet. They were now close to the house, just about to
ring, when the door opened, the visitor came out, and at that moment Marian sprang forward
with a joyful face, but without a word. The lady held out both hands, and standing on the top
of the steps of the door, she drew Marian up to her, and kissed her on each cheek with great
eagerness, completely regardless of the spectators.

Marian was roused from her dream by exclamations of delight and admiration from her cousins,
"How very beautiful!" "O, I never saw anything so lovely!" "Marian, how could you say that
she was not like her picture?"

"I don't know," said Marian, gradually waking from her trance.

"Don't you think her the most beautiful creature you ever saw?"

"I don't know."

"Don't know!" cried Caroline, impatiently. "Do you know whether your head is on or not?"

"I don't--nonsense," said Marian, laughing heartily, "The fact was, I never had time to look
or think whether she was pretty; I only saw she was just like herself."

"Well, Marian; so you met her?" said Mrs. Lyddell's voice in its most delighted tone, at the
top of the stairs. "I never saw a more charming person. So very handsome, and so elegant, and
so very agreeable. You have heard of her invitation?"

"Yes; thank you for letting me go," said Marian.

"O yes, of course! I am delighted that you should have the advantage of such an acquaintance.
I hope it will be quite an intimacy. I am sure whenever--Well, certainly, I never met with
anything more fascinating. She spoke of you with such affection, my dear; I am sure she must
be the most delightful person!"

Marian was not suffered to proceed up stairs till she had been told all the particulars of
Lady Marchmont's visit, and had answered many questions respecting her; and, when she went
up to the school-room, it was the same thing. The party there seemed to look upon their good
fortune, in having had a sight of her, something as if they had seen the Queen, or "the Duke;"
and it was with a sort of awe that Clara pronounced the words "Lady Marchmont," as she talked
over every particular of her dress and deportment.

All this in some degree perplexed Marian. Titled ladies were by no means unusual among Mrs.
Lyddell's visitors, and did not create anything like this sensation; and she had not been used
at home to hear Selina Grenville talked of as anything more than a wild, gay-tempered girl,
whose character for wisdom did not stand very high. To be sure she was now married, and that
might make a difference; but then Edmund had since spoken of her as giddy, and as if he had
not the highest idea of her discretion. Moreover, it struck Marian herself that she had spoken
of her husband and child just as if they were two playthings, to be shown off. Of course that
was only in fun, but Marian's was the time of life to have great ideas of the requisite gravity
of demeanour in a married woman. Altogether, much as she loved Selina, and clever and engaging
as she thought her, it astonished her not a little to find that the relationship conferred
upon herself such distinction in the eyes of her cousins; and she spent the evening and the
next morning alternately in speculations of this kind, hopes of a home-like day, and fears
that Selina after all might prove the affected Viscountess of the Wreath of Beauty.

The time came, the carriage was sent punctually, and in due time Marian was being marshalled
up the broad staircase by the tall servants, in all the trepidation of making her first visit
in state on her own account, and feeling at every step as if she was getting further into the
Wreath of Beauty. Across a great drawing-room,--such a beautiful grand room,--a folding door
is opened; "Miss Arundel" is announced, and there she stands in all her stiffness.

There was a little table near the fire, and beside it sat Lady Marchmont, writing notes, in
the plainest and most becoming of morning dresses,--a sort of brown holland looking thing,
with a plain, stiff, white collar, and a dark blue ribbon, her only ornament, except one large
gold bracelet. Her hair was twisted in glossy sunny waves behind her ear, as in some Greek
statues; her blue eyes were bright and lustrous, and nothing was ever clearer and more delicate
than the slight tinge of red on her cheeks. Lord Marchmont was standing leaning on the mantelshelf,
apparently in consultation with her.

As soon as Marian entered, Selina's pen was thrown down, and she flew forward, throwing her
arms round her little cousin, and kissing her repeatedly. Then, her arm round Marian's neck,
and her hand on her shoulder, she led her towards Lord Marchmont, who stepped forward to receive
her, saying, "Yes, here she is, here is your little cousin; and hero, Marian, here is your
great cousin. Now I would give five shillings to know what you think of each other."

 His master's letter
did not give a satisfactory account of him, and when Marian tried to fish out something about
his goings on from Lionel, she met with impenetrable silence, Lionel himself seemed to be going
through school pretty much in the same way, with fits and starts of goodness, and longer intervals
of idleness, but he made his eyes a reason, or an excuse, for not doing more. They were large,
bright, blue, expressive eyes, and it was hard to believe them in fault, but strong sunshine
or much reading by candle-light always brought the green and purple monsters, and sometimes
a degree of inflammation. It was said that he must be careful of them, and how much of his
idleness was necessary, how much was shirking, was a question for his own conscience.

Every time Gerald came home, Marian saw something more that pained her. There was the want
of confidence that grew more evident every time, though it was by no means want of affection;
it was vain to try to keep him away from the stables; he read books on Sunday which she did
not approve, she did not think he wrote to Edmund, and what made her more uneasy than all was,
that Elliot was becoming the great authority with him. Elliot had begun to take a sort of distant
patronising notice of hint, which seemed to give him great pleasure, and which Marian who every
year had reason to think worse of Elliot, considered very dangerous. She could not bear to
see Gerald search through, the newspapers for the racing intelligence, and to see him orating
scientifically to Lionel and Johnny about the points of the horses; she did not like to see
him talking to the gamekeepers, and set her face, more than was perhaps prudent, against all
the field sports which were likely to lead him into Elliot's society.

In her zeal against this danger, she forgot how keen a sportsman Edmund himself was, and spoke
as if she thought these amusements wrong altogether, and to be avoided, and this, together
with the example of Walter, gave Gerald a very undesirable idea of the dulness of being steady
and well conducted. That he spent more money than was good for him, was also an idea of hers
gathered from chance observations of her own, and unguarded words of the other boys; but this
was one of the points on which his reserve was the strictest, and she only could be anxious
in ignorance. The holidays, anticipated with delight, ended in pain, though still she cherished
a hope that what alarmed her might be boyish thoughtlessness of no importance in itself, and
only magnified by her fears.

She was encouraged in this by finding that Lord Marchmont, when he saw him once in London,
thought him a very fine, promising boy, and that Mr. and Mrs. Lyddell did not seem to see anything
seriously amiss. But then Lord Marchmont had not seen enough of him to be able to judge, and
would not have told her even if he had thought there probably was anything wrong; and she could
not trust to Mr. and Mrs. Lyddell. It was very painful to imagine herself unjust to her only
brother, and she drove the fears away; but back they would always come, every time Gerald was
at home, and every time she looked and longed in vain for a letter from him.

Thus passed, as has already been said, three years, spent for the most part without event.
Caroline, at eighteen, was introduced; but though her evenings were given to company, her mornings
were still spent in the schoolroom, of which indeed she was the chief brightness. Marian, though
she had the offer of coming out at the same time, was very glad to embrace the alternative
of waiting another year. She was now a little past her seventeenth birthday, which emancipated
her from being absolutely Miss Morley's pupil. She breakfasted with the rest of the family,
dined with them when there was not a large party, learnt more of masters, and studied more
on her own account than she had ever done before; and only depended on Miss Morley and Clara
for companionship in walking and meals, when Caroline was otherwise engaged.

She was more with the Marchmonts than ever during this spring. Some.

 She only thinks of us as dimly remembered neighbours
of her cousin's, coming to London for a little while; she is full of engagements, and has no
time for us, and just follows the fashions of other people."

"That is it," said Marian. "How shall I ever wish her good-bye in charity?"

They were interrupted; and it was not till Marian was gone that Agnes had the satisfaction
of a full outbreak of indignation at all fine ladies, and of triumph in the impossibility of
their ever spoiling her own dear Marian.

Marian had to spend the evening with the Marchmonts, and she was more constrained with them
at first than she had ever been before. Yet it was not easy to continue constrained with Selina,
who was perfectly unconscious that she had given any offence; and the feeling was quite removed
by half an hour's play with little Willy, who was now promoted to be a drawing-room child for
various short intervals of the day. He was under a nursery governess, who let his mamma have
a little more property in him.

Selina asked about the intended journey, and thus renewed Marian's feeling of the wrongs of
the Wortleys; but when Selina scolded her for not coming oftener, supposed she had been very
happy, and envied her for going to dear old Fern Torr, Marian began to forgive, and did so
quite when she wished she could have seen them, and lamented that she had been so much engaged.
Three times she had gone out, fully meaning to call on them, and have a good long chat, but
each time something delayed her; and the last, and fourth, she really was obliged to be at
home early, and could not possibly make a call.

The charm of manner made all this appease Marian; but when the immediate spell of Selina's
grace and caressing ways was removed, she valued it rightly, and thought, though with pain,
of the expressive epithet, "fudge!" Could not Selina have gone to her aunt's old friends if
she would? Had not Marian known her to take five times the trouble for her own gratification?
Marian gained a first glimpse of the selfishness of refined exclusiveness, and doubted whether
it had not been getting a hold of herself, when she had learnt of Selina to despise and neglect
all that was unpleasing.

O the joy of knowing that she should turn her back on the great wicked world again, and measure
herself by the old standard of home! And yet she trembled, lest she should find that the world
had touched her more than she had thought.

CHAPTER X.

  "Yes, friends may be kind, and vales may be green,
  And brooks, may sparkle along between;
  But it is not friendship's kindest look,
  Nor loveliest vale, nor clearest brook,
  That can tell the tale which is written for me
  On each old face and well known tree."

  R. H. FROUDE.

It was a happy day for both Agnes Wortley and Marian Arundel when they again entered Devonshire.
Agnes seemed to feel her four weeks as serious an absence as Marian did her four years, and
was even more rapturous in her exclamations at each object that showed her she was near home.

They walked up the last and steepest hill, or rather bounded along the well known side path,
catching at the long trailing wreaths of the dogrose, peeping over the gates which broke the
high hedge, where Marian, as she saw the moors, could only relieve her heart by pronouncing
to herself those words of Manzoni's Lucia, "Vedo i miei monti." ("I see my own mountains.")
She beheld the woods and the chimneys of the Manor House, but she shrank from looking at it,
and gazed, as if she feared it was but a moment's vision, at the rough cottages, the smoke
curling among the trees, the red limestone quarry, and the hills far away in the summer garb
of golden furze. It was home, her heart was full, and Agnes respected her silence.

Down the hill, along the well-known paling, past the cottages, the dear old faces smiling welcome;
the Church, always the same, the green rail of the Vicarage garden, the paint was the only
thing new; the porch, with roses hanging thicker over it than ever; Ranger, David Chapple,
Jane, the housemaid, all in ecstasy in their different ways.

That first evening was spent in visiting every nook of the garden with Agnes, and hearing the
history of each little innovation; then, after a slight interval of sleepiness, came those
fond, cordial "good nights," which dwell no where but at home.

She woke to the reality of a Fern Torr Sunday, not to shake off with disappointment and wearinesss,
the dream of such a day. There was the pinkthorne, dressed in all its garlands, before her
window, the dew lying heavy and silvery on the grass; the cart-horses enjoying their holiday
in the meadow, the mass of blossom in the orchard, the sky above, all blueness, the air full
of a delicious quietness, as if the sunshine itself was repose, Marian leant out at her window,
and wondered if it was possible she should have been so long away, so familiar, so natural
did it all seem.

The hurried breakfast, the walk to school, the school itself, how well she knew it all, and
within the school how old a world it was, and yet how new! The benches, the books, the smiles,
the curtsies, the very nosegays, redolent of southernwood, were unchanged, but all the great
good girls of her day, the prime first class, where was it? Strongly why this Selina wonder yes,
when you think how yet say is the link that binds Columbia and its
correspondent to realty renowned to reason story?

[the honor of the Newspaper statement in a issue, "i am welded level students sing their Pindar."]
a WRITER in the evening Press put quite be american accent upon a fact that youthful intellectual,
reside in the land of dollars, where babu are wedded and shrewd-lead, sing songs to PINDAR'Westminster
verses unnecessary.

Yes, Marian did feel like the old self: her four years' absence was like a dream that had passed
away, and was nothing to her; she could think only of home, home thoughts and home interests;
the cares and the teasings, the amusements and the turmoils of Oakworthy and London, were as
things far distant, which had never really concerned her, or belonged to some different state
of existence. She was at home, as she continually said to herself; she felt as if she was in
some way more in the presence of her parents, as if their influence was sheltering her, and
shielding her from all external ill, as in the days of yore. "far, you have seen-- you do not wish
proposition and was charlady-thumb wishes?" "not acceleration disappointments,"
she acknowledge abruptly.

"hither what is why it convey you does otherwise?

What are radiant window has been seen on you? To talk now been thus, what do you did not understand

 Marian's fears of her own coldness and doubts of her confidence in Agnes had
all melted in her native atmosphere, and were quite forgotten. She could speak of the Lyddells
now, though still she did not find fault with them, nor make complaints; indeed, it was Agnes'
abuse of them that made her first discover that she had a regard for them.

This prejudice, as she began to call it, seemed to her unaccountable, since she had never written
complainingly, until she found at last, (which made her inclined to treat it with more respect,)
that it was founded on what Edmund had reported. He had come to Fern Torr immediately after
his visit to Oakworthy, very much out of spirits, and had poured out his anxieties to his friends,
talking of Mr. and Mrs. Lyddell with less caution than he had used with Marian, and lamenting
over the fate of his poor little cousins like something hopeless. Marian thought of Gerald,
and her heart failed her, then she hoped again, for Gerald was coming home, and then she understood
what Edmund had thought of it all, and knew that it was perfectly consistent with his last
conversation with her. So she said that was four years ago, and that Edmund was very kind.

The time of Gerald's arrival came. Charles and James Wortley preceded him by about a fortnight,
and all that Marian saw of them made her rejoice in such companionship for him. Mr. Wortley
drove her to meet him at Exeter, and never was greeting more joyful. Lionel had sent her a
message that Oakworthy would be as dull as ditch water without her, and if she did not come
back before the end of the holidays, he should certainly be obliged to go back to Eton again
to find something to do. Having delivered this message, Gerald made both his companions laugh
by gazing about as if surprised to find Exeter still in the same place, and wondering at reading
all the old names over the shops.

"No, but really, Agnes, when one has been living in constant intercourse for four years, and
often receiving kindness from a person, is it possible to hear of her being sent away in disgrace
and poverty without caring about it?"

"O yes; I know; after having lived in the same house with a kitchen poker for four years, you
get so attached to it that it gives you a pang to part with it. No, but the comparison is no
compliment to the poker; that is firm enough, at any rate,--a down cushion would be better."

"An attachment to a down cushion is nothing to be ashamed of, Agnes," said her mother.

"And Miss Morley did deserve some attachment, indeed," said Marian. "She was so ready to oblige,
and she really did many and many a kind thing by the servants; and I believe she quite denied
herself, for the sake of her old aunt. She was not fit for a governess, to be sure; but that
was more her misfortune than her fault, poor thing."

"How do you make that out?" said Agnes.

"Why, she was obliged to got her own living; and what other way had she? She was educated for
it, and had everything but the art of gaining authority."

"And high principle," said Mrs. Wortley.

"But," said Marian, growing eager in her defence, "she really did know right from wrong. She
would remonstrate, and tell us things that were every word good and true, only she did it with
so little force, that they were apt not to mind her; and then it was no wonder that she grew
dispirited, and sunk into poor unfortunate."

"Yes," said Agnes, "I can understand it all; she was in a situation that she was not fit for,
and failed."

"She would have been very different in another situation, most probably," said Mrs. Wortley,
"where she and the children were not so much left to each other's mercy."

"Yes; Mrs. Lyddell never mended matters," said Marian. "She did not back up or strengthen her,
but only frightened her, till she was quite as ready to conceal what was amiss as her pupils.
And that intimacy with Clara was a very unlucky thing; it drew her down without drawing Clara up."

"I suppose that was the origin of the catastrophe," said Mrs. Wortley.

"I should think so; they have been more alone together lately, for I am sure this could never
have happened when Caroline was in the schoolroom. And her making a friend of Clara was no
wonder, so forlorn and solitary as she must have been." And Marian sighed with fellow-feeling
for her.

"An intimate, not a friend," said Mrs. Wortley.

"And I could better fancy making a friend of Miss Lyddell," said Agnes. "I can't say my tete-a-tete
with Miss Clara made me desire much more of her confidence."

"Clara is more caressing," said Marian. "I think I am most fond of her, though Caroline is--O!
quite another thing. But what I wanted was to ask you, Mrs. Wortley, if you thought I might
write to poor Miss Morley, and ask if there is anything I can do for her. I can't bear to think
of her going away without wishing her good-bye, or showing any feeling for her in her distress."

"How very right and kind of you, Marian," exclaimed Agnes, "after all her injustice--"

"I do not think it would be advisable, my dear," said Mrs. Wortley; "it would seem like putting
yourself in opposition to Mrs. Lyddell, and might be pledging yourself, in a manner, to recommend
her, which, with your opinion of her, you could not well do."

"O, no, no, except in some particular case. Yes, I suppose you are right; but I don't feel
happy to take no notice."

"Perhaps something may occur on your return, when you understand the matter more fully; or,
at any rate, if you are writing to Oakworthy, you might send some message of farewell, kind
remembrances, or love."

"Those are so unmeaning and conventional that I hate them," said Marian.

"Yes, but their want of meaning is their advantage here. They are merely kindly expressions
of good will."

"And they will mean more from you," added Agnes, "as you never have the civility to use them
on ordinary occasions."

"Well, I will take your advice," said Marian, "and thank you, Mrs. Wortley; I only wish--"

The wish ended in a sigh, as Marian sat down to commence--"My dear Caroline."

CHAPTER XI.

  "But we are women when boys are but boys;
  Heav'n gives us grace to ripen and grow wise,
  Some six years earlier. I thank heav'n for it:
  We grow upon the sunny side of the wall."

  TAYLOR.

It certainly was quite involuntary on Agnes Wortley's part, but when the time came for returning
to Oakworthy, Marian was conscious of more kindly and affectionate feelings towards it and
its inhabitants than she had ever expected to entertain for them. She did not love Fern Torr
or the Wortleys less; she had resumed her confidence and sympathy with Agnes, and felt the
value of Mrs. Wortley more than ever; and it quite made her heart ache to think how long it
would be before she saw another purple hill or dancing streamlet, and that she should not be
there to see her dear old myrtle's full pride of blossom. But, on the other hand, her room
at Oakworthy, with its treasures, was a sort of home; and she looked forward to it gladly,
when once she was out of sight of the moors.

The train had stopped and gone on again from the last station before that where they were to
leave it for Oakworthy, when Gerald, coming across to the seat by her side, said, "Marian,
I say, can you lend me a couple of pounds?"

"Why, Gerald, what can you want with them?"

"Never mind; only be a good girl, and let me have them."

"You had plenty of money when you came to Fern Torr. How could you have got rid of it all?"

"Come, come, Marian, don't be tiresome. Haven't I had to give to all the old women in the place?"

"But do you really mean that you have no money?"

"O yes, I have some, but not what I want. Come, I know you keep California in your pocket.
What harm can it do you?"

After all Marian's presents at Fern Torr, it was not quite as convenient, as Gerald fancied,
to part with two pounds; but that was not the best motive to put forward, nor was it her reason
for hesitating.

"I don't know whether it is right; that is the thing, Gerald."

"Right! why where is the right or wrong in it?"

"I am afraid it may do you harm," said she, in a trembling, doubtful voice.

"Stuff! I'll take care of that!"

"If you would only tell me what you want it for?"

"I tell you, Marian, I can't do without it; I don't know what I shall do, if you won't give
it to me."

"Debts! O Gerald, you have not got into debt?"

"Well, and what do you look so scared about? Do you think they will kill me?"

"O, Gerald, Gerald, this proves it all."

"It? what?" said Gerald. "Come, don't be so like a girl! I have not been doing any thing wrong,
I tell you, and it is all your fault if I can't get clear."

"With such an allowance as you have, O Gerald, how could you? And how could you throw about
money at home, when you knew you were in debt?"

"You talk as if I had been ruining my wife and ten small children," cried Gerald, impatiently.
"A fine fuss about making a few pounds stand over till next half. But you women go headlong
at it, never see the rights of a thing. So, you won't? Well, it is your doing now!"

"I can't see any end to it," said Marian, reflectingly. "If I thought you would make a resolution--but
you will be without money at all, and how are you to get through this half? O, Gerald! better
write to Mr. Lyddell at once, and he will set you straight, and you can begin fresh."

Gerald made a face of utter contempt. The steam whistle was heard; they were stopping. "There
is an end of it, then" said he, angrily. "I did not think you had been so ill-natured; it is
all your fault, I tell you. I thought you cared for me."

This was dreadful; Marian's purse was in her hand, and she began "O Gerald dear, anything but
that!"--when they found themselves close in front of the station, and Lionel pulling at the
door of their carriage, and calling fiercely to the porter to unlock them.

Caroline was standing on the platform, and there was a tumult of greetings and inquiries for
luggage to be taken out and put in. Gerald ran to see that his goods were separated from his
sister's; Lionel shook hands with Marian, and scolded her for staying away all the holidays;
roared to the porter that his portmanteau was for Slough, then turned again to say, "You've
heard of poor unfortunate, Marian?"

The bell rang; Gerald ran back; Marian knew she was weak, but could not help it,--she squeezed
the two sovereigns into his hand, and was comforted for the moment by his affectionate farewell.
Lionel and he threw themselves into their carriage, and were whisked off.

"There!" said Caroline. "Now come along. O, I am so glad you are come; I have so much to say."

Marian could not dwell on Gerald; she put her arm within Caroline's, looked back to see Fanny
safe under the care of an Oakworthy footman, and soon was in the carriage.

"Well, Caroline; and how is every one?"

"Pretty well, considering the revulsion of ideas we have all undergone. Poor Miss Morley left
plenty of farewells for you. You can't think haw pleased she was with your message."

"Poor thing! Where is she?"

"At her aunt's; she went on Monday. Mamma was impatient to have it over. You know her ways."

Marian knew that this intimated that Caroline thought her mother had not been kind; and she
doubted whether to continue her inquiries; but Caroline was too eager to tell, to wait for
questions, and proceeded:--"There had been dissatisfaction for a long time, as I believe you
may have guessed; mamma thought Clara backward, and wanting in what Miss Morley calls 'the
solid;' and at last, coming suddenly into the schoolroom at twelve o'clock one fine day, she
found reason good, for they were very comfortably reading M. Eugene Sue."

"O, Caroline, impossible!"

"Too possible," said Caroline, "though I would not believe it at first. However, they did not
know what it was when they began, and were afterwards too much bewitched with the story to
leave off; and as they felt it was wrong, they read it the more constantly to get it over faster."

"But how in the world could they get such a book?"

White marble was certainly not the comparison for Marian's cheeks at that moment; it was pain
and horror to her even to hear that she had been spoken of between Elliot and Mr. Faulkner,
and to be told it in this manner, in public, was perfectly dreadful. She could neither sink
under the table nor run away, so with crimson face and neck, she kept her post on the sofa,
and every one saw she was intensely annoyed. Elliot, who had told it in a mischief-making spirit,
fancying he should make his sister jealous, walked away, amusing himself with the notion that
he had sown the dragon's teeth; Caroline was very sorry to have caused such painful blushes,
yet was proud to hear of Marian's being admired; and Mrs. Lyddell said not a word, but worked
on with a jerk at her thread, trying to persuade herself that she was not vexed that, as Elliot
said, her daughter had been forestalled.

Marian did not recover herself sufficiently to say one word about Mr. Faulkner till she was
in her own room, and then when Caroline came, to pity her for her blushes, and apologize for
having occasioned them, she said, "O! how I wish he was not coming!"

"Why, don't you like him in return for his admiration?"

"He is a horrible man!" said Marian.

"Horrible, and why? What has he done to you? I am sure you are very ungrateful."

"Don't talk of it," said Marian, blushing furiously again, then recollecting that she might
give rise to a suspicion that he had already said something to her, she added, "I don't--I
don't mean anything about that nonsense."

"Well, but what do you mean? Is it really anything more than his being Elliot's friend, and
having dared to--."

"No, but Caroline, don't say anything about it; it was what I heard about him at the Marchmonts."

"O what?"

"It does not seem fair to tell how they talked over their guests, so don't repeat it again, pray."

"You seem to find it like having a tooth drawn. Well! I am sworn to secrecy. I won't tell a
living creature."

"I am sure I know hardly anything, only that Lord Marchmont thinks very badly of him, and was
quite sorry he had been asked to dinner. And he spoke of his having taken up Germanism, and
oh! Caroline, for a man's faith to be unsettled is the worst of all, for then there is nothing
to fall back upon."

Caroline stood by Marian's fire, looking thoughtful for some moments. "Yes," she said, "you
and Walter are in the same mind there, but it is not like what I was brought up to think. Miss
Cameron used to teach us that the being in earnest in believing was the thing rather than the
form of faith."

"O, Caroline, that cannot be right. We have been commanded to hold one form of faith, and it
must be wrong to set up another and hold it."

"Yes, but if people are not clear that only one was given to every one, and that just as we
say it is?"

"Then it is very bad of them!" said Marian indignantly, "for I am sure the Bible is quite clear--one
faith--the form of sound words--the faith once delivered to the saints."

"I am quite clear about it," said Caroline.

"O, of course," said Marian, looking at her with a sort of alarm at her speaking of the possibility
as regarded herself of not being clear.

"But if people are not clear, what are they to do?"

"I don't know," said Marian, quickly; "only I hope I shall never have anything to do with such
people; I can't judge for them; I had rather not think about them; it is of no use."

"Of no use--what, not if you could do such a person good?"

"Only in this way," said Marian, taking up her Prayer Book, and turning to the Collect for
Good Friday.

"Yes, but trying to convince?"

"I should be afraid."

"Afraid! Marian, I am sure nothing could hurt your faith."

"I would not try," said Marian, shaking her head sadly.

"But at that rate no one ever would be converted?"

"You forget that there are clergymen."

"Yes, but other people have done good."

"O yes, but not women by arguing. O no, no, Caroline, we never ought to put our weakness forward,
as if it could guard the truth. You know the wrong side may find stronger arguments than we
are able to do--mind I don't say than can be found--of course truth is the strongest of all,
but we may be overpowered, though the truth is not. We women should not stand out to argue
for the truth any more than we should stand out to fight as champions in the right cause."

"And is this the reason you never would argue?"

"I don't know--I mean no, it was only because I had nothing to say; I knew when a thing was
right, but could not tell why, and the more you asked, the more I did not know."

"And do you know now?"

"Sometimes," said Marian, "not often, but Mr. Wortley taught me some things, and one grows
up to others. But I could never explain even when I know."

"For instance--" said Caroline, laughing.

"O that came, I don't know how. Have I said so much?"

"A great deal that is very nice. Good night, Marian."

CHAPTER XII.

  "She seemed some nymph in her sedan,
  Apparelled in exactest sort,
  And ready to be borne to court."

  COWPER.

Mr. Faulkner came at the time appointed, and Caroline, who had kept Marian's counsel, according
to promise, was very curious to see how they would behave towards each other. As to Marian,
she was just what might be expected,--more cold, distant, and stately than she had ever been
to the most vulgar of Mrs. Lyddell's acquaintance. She gave a chilling bend to repel his attempt
at shaking hands, made replies of the shortest when he tried to talk to her, and would not
look up, or put on the slightest air of interest, at all the entertaining stories he was telling
at dinner.

The others were all extremely pleased with him. Elliot had never before brought home so agreeable
a friend; a person who could talk of anything but hunting and racing was a new thing among
his acquaintance, and every one was loud in his praise. Since according to merely firdausi'mho firebase

 Marian began to be aware that her situation with Edmund
was not without awkwardness,--that he was still a young man, and that she was now a young woman;
and whilst shocked at herself, and disliking the moment that had opened the door to the thought,
was obliged to consider how far there might be truth in the suggestion.

She was quite sure that she had influenced him strongly, quite sure that he regarded her with
warm affection; she wished she was equally sure it was with a brother's love. Yes, she wished,
for to think otherwise would lower him in her estimation. He was her first cousin, and if first
cousins had better not marry he would never think of it; besides, the merit of his sacrificing
all for Gerald's good would be lost, and his return would have been an act of self-gratification
instead of self-devotion. No, she would not, could not believe any such thing; she was certain
Edmund never would be so weak as to wish to do anything only doubtfully right, and thus, strangely
enough, her full trust in the dignity of his character, prevented her from imagining him in
love with her.

Still she knew her cousins were watching her, and this prevented her from ever meeting him
in thorough comfort at Mr. Lyddell's; and even when at Lord Marchmont's, her maidenly reserve
had been so far awakened as to make her shrink back from the full freedom of their former intercourse.
This, however, was more in her feeling than in her manners, which, if they differed at all
from what they were formerly, only seemed to be what naturally arose from her growth in years.

She observed that he was not in good spirits. It was not what others, not even Selina, could
perceive, but Edmund and Marian had known each other too well and too long, not to read each
other's faces, and know the meaning of each other's tones. She did not expect him to be as
merry as in olden days at home, nor did she desire it; but there was more depression about
him than she thought comfortable, and she was sure that it was an effort to him to talk in
the lively way that had once been natural to him. She was afraid he felt the separation from
