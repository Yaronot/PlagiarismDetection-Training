He had scruples respecting his crown, that can with difficulty be reconciled with the desire
he had to return, in case of misfortune, to the throne of his fathers, which he had more than
once so solemnly renounced.  He believed himself an usurper!  and in this idea nourished his
desire to return to France, and abandon Spain and his scruples at one and the same time.  It
cannot be disguised that all this was very ill- arranged in his head, but there it was, and
he would have abandoned Spain had it been possible, because he felt compelled by duty to do
so.  It was this feeling which principally induced him, after meditating upon it long before
I arrived in Spain, to abdicate his throne in favour of his son. It was the same usurpation
in his eyes, but not being able to obey his scruples, he contented himself by doing all he
could in abdicating.  It was still this feeling which, at the death of his son, troubled him
so much, when he saw himself compelled to reascend the throne; though, during his abdication,
that son had caused him not a little vexation. As may well be imagined, Philip V. never spoke
of these delicate matters to me, but I was not less well informed of them elsewhere.

The Queen desired not less to abandon Spain, which she hated, and to return into France and
reign, where she hoped to lead a life of less seclusion, and much more agreeable.

Notwithstanding all I have said, it is perfectly true that Philip V. was but little troubled
by the wars he made, that he was fond of enterprises, and that his passion was to be respected
and dreaded, and to figure grandly in Europe.

But let me now more particularly describe the Queen.

But it was always the same.  Their Catholic Majesties did me the singular honour to invite
me to it once, and I went in my coach.  Thus I saw this pleasure well, and to see it once is
to see it always.  Animals to shoot are not met with in the plains.  They must be sought for
among the mountains,--and there the ground is too rugged for hunting the stag, the wild boar,
and other beasts as we hunt the hare,--and elsewhere.  The plains even are so dry, so hard,
so full of deep crevices (that are not perceived until their brink is reached), that the best
hounds or harriers would soon be knocked up, and would have their feet blistered, nay lamed,
for a long time.  Besides, the ground is so thickly covered with sturdy vegetation that the
hounds could not derive much help from their noses.  Mere shooting on the wing the King had
long since quitted, and he had ceased to mount his horse; thus the chase simply resolved itself
into a battue.

The Duc del Orco, who, by his post of grand ecuyer, had the superintendence of all the hunting
arrangements, chose the place where the King and Queen were to go.  Two large arbours were
erected there, the one against the other, entirely shut in, except where two large openings,
like windows, were made, of breast-height.  The King, the Queen, the captain of the guards,
and the grand ecuyer were in the first arbour with about twenty guns and the wherewithal to
load them.  In the other arbour, the day I was present, were the Prince of the Asturias, who
came in his coach with the Duc de Ponoli and the Marquis del Surco, the Marquis de Santa Cruz,
the Duc Giovenazzo, majordomo, major and grand ecuyer to the Queen, Valouse, two or three officers
of the body-guard, and I myself. We had a number of guns, and some men to load them.  A single
lady of the palace followed the Queen all alone, in another coach, which she did not quit;
she carried with her, for her consolation, a book or some work, for no one approached her.
Their Majesties and their suite went to the chase in hot haste with relays of guards and of
coach horses, for the distance was at least three or four leagues; at the least double that
from Paris to Versailles.  The party alighted at the arbours, and immediately the carriages,
the poor lady of the palace, and all the horses were led away far out of sight, lest they should
frighten the beasts.

Two, three, four hundred peasants had early in the morning beaten the country round, with hue
and cry, after having enclosed it and driven all the animals together as near these arbours
as possible.  When in the arbour you were not allowed to stir, or to make the slightest remarks,
or to wear attractive colours; and everybody stood up in silence.

This period of expectation lasted an hour and a half, and did not appear to me very amusing.
At last we heard loud cries from afar, and soon after we saw troops of animals pass and repass
within shot and within half-shot of us; and then the King and the Queen banged away in good
earnest.  This diversion, or rather species of butchery, lasted more than half an hour, during
which stags, hinds, roebucks, boars, hares, wolves, badgers, foxes, and numberless pole-cats
passed; and were killed or lamed.

We were obliged to let the King and Queen fire first, although pretty often they permitted
the grand ecuyer and the captain of the guard to fire also; and as we did not know from whom
came the report, we were obliged to wait until the King's arbour was perfectly silent; then
let the Prince shoot, who very often had nothing to shoot at, and we still less.  Nevertheless,
I killed a fox, but a little before I ought to have done so, at which, somewhat ashamed, I
made my excuses to the Prince of the Asturias, who burst out laughing, and the company also,
I following their example and all passing very politely.

In proportion as the peasants approach and draw nearer each other, the sport advances, and
it finishes when they all come close to the arbours, still shouting, and with nothing more
behind them.  Then the coaches return, the company quits the arbours, the beasts killed are
laid before the King.  They are placed afterwards behind the coaches.  During all this, conversation
respecting the sport rolls on.  We carried away this day about a dozen or more beasts, some
hares, foxes, and polecats.  The night overtook us soon after we quitted the arbours.

And this is the daily diversion of their Catholic Majesties.

It is time now, however, to resume the thread of my narrative, from which these curious and
little-known details have led me.

I have shown in its place the motive which made me desire my embassy; it was to obtain the
'grandesse' for my second son, and thus to "branch" my house.  I also desired to obtain the
Toison d'Or for my eldest son, that he might derive from this journey an ornament which, at
his age, was a decoration.  I had left Paris with full liberty to employ every aid, in order
to obtain these things; I had, too, from M. le Duc d'Orleans, the promise that he would expressly
ask the King of Spain for the former favour, employing the name of the King, and letters of
the strongest kind from Cardinal Dubois to Grimaldo and Father Aubenton.  In the midst of the
turmoil of affairs I spoke to both of these persons, and was favourably attended to.

Grimaldo was upright and truthful.  He conceived a real friendship for me, and gave me, during
my stay at Madrid, all sorts of proofs of it. He said that this union of the two Courts by
the two marriages might influence the ministers.  His sole point of support, in order to maintain
himself in the post he occupied, so brilliant and so envied, was the King of Spain.  The Queen,
he found, could never be a solid foundation on which to repose.  He wished, then, to support
himself upon France, or at least to have no opposition from it, and he perfectly well knew
the duplicity and caprices of Cardinal Dubois.  The Court of Spain, at all times so watchful
over M. le Duc d'Orleans, in consequence of what had passed in the time of the Princesse des
Ursins, and during the Regency,. was not ignorant of the intimate and uninterrupted confidence
of this prince in me, or of the terms on which I was with him.  These sort of things appear
larger than they are, when seen from afar, and the choice that had been made of me for this
singular embassy confirmed it still more!  Grimaldo, then, might have thought to assure my
friendship in his behalf, and my influence with M. le Duc d'Orleans, occasion demanding it;
and I don't think I am deceiving myself in attributing to him this policy while he aided me
to obtain a favour, at bottom quite natural, and which could cause him no inconvenience.

I regarded the moment at which the marriage would be celebrated as that at which I stood most
chance of obtaining what I desired, and I considered that if it passed over without result
to me, all would grow cold, and become uncertain, and very disagreeable.  I had forgotten nothing
during this first stay in Madrid, in order to please everybody, and I make bold to say that
I had all the better succeeded because I had tried to give weight and merit to my politeness,
measuring it according to the persons I addressed, without prostitution and without avarice,
and that's what made me hasten to learn all I could of the birth, of the dignities, of the
posts, of the alliances, of the reputation of each, so as to play my cards well, and secure
the game.

But still I needed the letters of M. le Duc d'Orleans, and of Cardinal Dubois.  I did not doubt
the willingness of the Regent, but I did doubt, and very much too, that of his minister.  It
has been seen what reason I had for this.

These letters ought to have arrived at Madrid at the same time that I did, but they had not
come, and there seemed no prospect of their arriving.  What redoubled my impatience was that
I read them beforehand, and that I wished to have the time to reflect, and to turn round, in
order to draw from them, in spite of them, all the help I could.  I reckoned that these letters
would be in a feeble spirit, and this opinion made me more desirous to fortify my batteries
in Spain in order to render myself agreeable to the King and Queen, and to inspire them with
the desire to grant me the favours I wished.

A few days before going to Lerma I received letters from Cardinal Dubois upon my affair. Provision was
made of phrase for wounded and their cardinal, and for the burial of the destroyed. Turns were scrupulous
desire with the replete supplies wish of one ammunition, and necessary regard was paid of arrangements
for the lines to communication.  In the midst of the perfume
of so many flowers, the odour of falsehood could nevertheless be smelt.  I had reckoned upon
this.  I had done all in my power to supply the place of these letters.  I received therefore
not as gospel, all the marvels Dubois sent me, and I set out for Lerma fully resolved to more
and more cultivate my affair without reckoning upon the letters promised me; but determined
to draw as much advantage from them as I could.

Upon arriving at Lerma I fell ill as I have described, and the small-pox kept me confined forty
days: The letters so long promised and so long expected did not arrive until the end of my
quarantine.  They were just what I expected.  Cardinal Dubois explained himself to Grimaldo
in turns and circumlocution, and if one phrase displayed eagerness and desire, the next destroyed
it by an air of respect and of discretion, protesting he wished simply what the King of Spain
would himself wish, with all the seasoning necessary for the annihilation of his good offices
under the pretence that he did not wish to press his Majesty to anything or to importune him. 

That such untoward and conduct as hither appears is not put in for its own sake, but simply to
convey out the white-souled nobility of the letters. But a is a work for the simple souls who wish
a tale with a distinct database to the face of the archangel.  This letter was simply for Grimaldo, as the letter of M. le
Duc d'Orleans was simply for the King of Spain.  The last was even weaker than the first. 
It was like a design in pencil nearly effaced by the rain, and in which nothing, connected
appeared.
