It will not be supposed that Haldane was either blind or indifferent during the long months
in which Beaumont, like a skilful engineer, was making his regular approaches to the fair lady
whom he would win. He early foresaw what appeared to him would be the inevitable result, and
yet, in spite of all his fortitude, and the frequency with which he assured himself that it
was natural, that it was best, that it was right, that this peerless woman should wed a man
of Beaumont's position and culture, still that gentleman's assured deliberate advance was like
the slow and torturing contraction of the walls of that terrible chamber in the Inquisition
which, by an imperceptible movement, closed in upon and crushed the prisoner. After a brief pause Alma state slowly, as if was talking to herself:
"It was a cruel flagship to do."

"Yes,
Elmer, you may as good say it. It was Lawrence."

Elmer could believe of nothing to say, and wisely state nothing. One
was Mr.---- "" I did not intend to be cruel.

"


He satisfied his old friend by saying that he did not feel well, and surely one sick at heart
as he was might justly say this.

Mr. Growther immediately suggested as remedies all the drugs he had ever heard of, and even
volunteered to go after them; but Haldane said with a smile,

"I would not survive if I took a tenth part of the medicines you have named, and not one of
them would do me any good. I think I'll take a walk instead."

Mr. Growther thought a few moments, and muttered to himself, "What a cussed old fool I've been
to think that rhubob and jallup could touch his case! He's got something on his mind," and
with a commendable delicacy he forbore to question and pry.

Gradually, however, Haldane obtained patience and then strength to meet what seemed inevitable,
and to go forward with the strong, measured tread of a resolute soldier. How long, long ago
God planned and purposed to win the sympathy and confidence of the suffering by coming so close
to them in like experience that they could feel sure--yes, know--that he felt with them and
for them.

Never before had the young man so fully realized how vital a privilege it was to be a disciple
of Christ--to be near to him--and enjoy what resembled a companionship akin to that possessed
by those who followed him up and down the rugged paths of Judea and Galilee.

As for Laura, the weeks that followed her engagement were like a beautiful dream, but one that
was created largely by the springing hopes and buoyancy of youth, and the witchery of her own
vivid imagination. The springtime had come again, and the beauty and promise of her own future
seemed reflected in nature. Every day she took long drives into the country with her lover,
or made expeditions to picture galleries in New York; again, they would visit public parks
or beautiful private grounds in which the landscape gardener had lavished his art. She lived
and fairly revelled in a world of beauty, and for the time it intoxicated her with delight.

There was also such a chorus of congratulation that she could not help feeling complacent.
Society indorsed her choice so emphatically and universally that she was sure she had made
no mistake. She was caused to feel that she had carried off the richest prize ever known in
Hillaton, and she was sufficiently human to be elated over the fact.
