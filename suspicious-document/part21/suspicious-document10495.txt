The #Feretory#, where the feretra or shrines of the saints were placed, lies behind the high
altar and reredos, and the two doors in the latter give access to it. At one time, before the
erection of the reredos, the feretory must have been visible from the choir. Behind the doors
is a raised platform, seven feet in breadth, extending right across. The upper surface of this
is now only three feet above the ground level, but originally it must have been far higher.
Four steps give access to it. Before it is a hollow space with stumps of piers, demonstrating
the ancient presence of an arcade in front of the platform. The feretory is without internal
decoration, but the exterior of the east wall is adorned with nine rich Decorated tabernacles,
with the yet legible names of saints and king who once occupied the eighteen pedestals within
them. This inscription is to be found here:--

    Corpora sanctorum sunt hic in pace sepulta,
     Ex meritis quorum fulgent miracula multa.

the chantry, has surmounted under receptacle.

There is here, as was the case with Gardiner's chantry, a small room at the eastern end. In
this are chests in which relics were kept.

The interior part of the choir aisles have received "Wykeham" windows, four on each side, though
from the exterior only three can be seen. The westernmost on the north side has two lights
partly looking into the open, while two are unglazed and the top of one looks into the northern
transept. On the south side all are glazed, but only three get any light from outside. These
can be seen from the close at the junction of transept and retro-choir. All these windows have
blank panelling or arcading below. It looks as if Wykeham or his successors meant to reduce
the width of the Norman transepts, so as to bring them into better proportion with the eastern
arm of the church.

Between the presbytery and the side aisles, extending from pier to pier, are screens of pierced
stonework, erected by Bishop Fox, whose motto frequently occurs on them, together with his
initials and Cardinal Beaufort's. On the top of the screens are six painted chests (see p.
95), in which are collected the bones of saints and kings of the Saxon period; the original
collection being made by Henry of Blois. These #Mortuary Chests# were desecrated by the Cromwellian
ruffians when they broke into the cathedral, and the bones were hurled through the stained
glass of the west and other windows. Afterwards they were collected once more and replaced
in the chests where they now lie. Among the relics are the bones of Edred, Edmund, Canute,
William Rufus, Emma, Bishops Wina, Alwyn, Egbert, Cenwulf or Kenulf, Cynegils, and Ethelwulf,
and there are the old inscriptions to indicate whose remains were originally enclosed within
the boxes, though there is now no warrant that the bones within correspond at all to the names
without.

Among those who have been buried in the presbytery aisles is Bishop de Pontissara, of whom
Rudborne says that he was buried ex aquilonari plaga majoris altaris. Accordingly we find his
monument on the north side. Close by him, and still nearer the altar, was laid Hardicanute,
the last Danish king, who was brought hither from Lambeth for interment. His death was attributed
to "excessive drinking." In the southern aisle are Richard, the Conqueror's younger son; Edward,
eldest born of Alfred the Great; and Bishop Nicholas de Ely's heart.

Eastward of the feretory the building is known by the name of the #Retro-choir#, and presents
a very old and pure example of Early English work from the hands of Bishop de Lucy. The aisles
are said to have been used as a model in the building of Salisbury Cathedral. Similar processional
aisles may be seen also at Hereford on a minor scale. This part of the cathedral is lower and
consequently appears broader than the more westerly portion. There is a considerable amount
of wall-space, only interrupted by the numerous imposing chantries erected on the floor. The
lower part of the walls is remarkable for some fine, though simple, blank arcading, dating
also from De Lucy's time; while light is given by pairs of lancet windows, the rear arches
being borne on groups of detached shafts. Many of the original chased tiles of the pavement
remain to this day, and, in fact, there has been little interference with De Lucy's work. Unfortunately,
however, as has been remarked, much of it has settled considerably, throwing the south-eastern
angle altogether out of the perpendicular, one vaulting-shaft having in this manner been bent
back and cracked in half. The effects of the subsidence can easily be seen in the photograph
of the south aisle of the retro-choir looking toward the east.

As one passes beyond the feretory through the retro-choir, the #Chantry of William Waynflete#
stands to the north of the central alley. The canopy is very elaborate and beautiful, and plentiful
traces of the original colour still can be seen, especially on the groining. On each side are
three flat-headed arches, those at the east end being closed, while on each side of the piers
adjoining the west end there are narrow open arches. Corniced and battlemented screens fill
these arches to mid-height. The figure on the tomb is a modern restoration, very elaborately
clad in full pontificals, while the hands are clasped about a heart, representing the sursum
corda, or lifting up of the heart. The chantry is kept in repair by Magdalen College, Oxford,
which Waynflete founded. Its situation, like that of the companion tomb of Cardinal Beaufort,
makes it very impressive. There is no altar now. At the east end is a blank wall surmounted
by three empty canopied niches, while at the other are two open gratings.

In the corresponding position to the south is the #Chantry of Cardinal Beaufort#, now kept
in repair by the Dukes of Beaufort. In Britton's time, as he tells us, there had fallen a "horse-load
of the pinnacles in the canopy of Cardinal Beaufort's chantry." Owing, however, to the extreme
elaboration, the effect is hardly impaired by this loss. The plan of the tomb is two groups
of four clustered piers at each end, supporting a mass of canopies, niches, and pinnacles,
which "bewilder the sight and senses by their number and complexity," as Britton quaintly says.
The screen at the west end is closed, that at the east end open. The vault displays some elaborate
fan-tracery. The body of the cardinal is presented in his scarlet official robes and the tasselled
and corded hat, and the serenity of his face suggests very little the traditional portrait
of him, as represented, for example, in Shakespeare's "Henry V." His death-bed moments, it
is well known, have been much misrepresented. The inscription originally on his tomb has been
destroyed, but Godwin quotes one sentence of it thus:--Tribularer si nescirem misericordias tuas.

Against the north wall, not far from Waynflete's chantry, is an unknown tomb with part of an
effigy, to the east of which is the grave of one William Symonds, "Gentleman, of Winchester
twice Maior and Alderman," as his epitaph of 1616 relates. The last four lines of the inscription
run as follows:--

    His Merrit doth Enherit Life and Fame,
    For whilst this City stands Symonds his name
    In alle men's harts shall never be forgotten,
    For poores prayers rise when flesh lyes rotten.

Between the same chantry and the wall lies the tomb of Bishop de Rupibus, while in the space
between the chantries of Beaufort and Waynflete lies the only ancient military effigy in the
cathedral, a genuine relic of the fourteenth century. It is commonly known as William de Foix,
and represents, in a slightly mutilated form, a knight in surcoat and complete ringed armour
of the thirteenth century. His legs are crossed[5] and the feet rest on a crouching lion, while
the head is supported on two cushions which were formerly held up by angels. The right hand
grasps the sword hilt, and the pointed shield, one of the earliest examples of a quartered
shield, bears "quarterly, in the first and fourth, the arms of Bearn, two cows passant, gorged
with collars and bells; in the second and third, three garbs; over all a cross." On the front
edge of the slab Mr F.J. Baigent discovered the name Petrus Gavston or Gauston twice encised,
but to this "scribbling" Mr Weston S. Walford, who has a note on this tomb in the fifteenth
volume of the Archeological Journal, does not attach much importance, for it may merely record
the engraver's conjecture as to the person here buried. The body of Edward II.'s favourite,
Piers, was moved from Oxford to King's Langley in Hertfordshire two years after his execution,
and buried there on January 2, 1314, in the presence of the king. It is not known to have been
moved since. It seems probable that the effigy here is that of the father of the Piers known
to us, a Sir Arnold de Gavaston, a record of whose interment at Winchester in May 1302 we possess,
with the additional fact that Edward I. sent money and two pieces of cloth of gold to the funeral.
Such respect would naturally be paid to the father of Edward II.'s foster-brother. Mr Walford
suggests that the garbs on the shield are a canting allusion to the name Gabaston or Gavaston,
for the spelling varies very much--Gaveston, Gaverston, and Gaberston being also found. The
date of the tomb Mr Walford places between the death of Arnold in 1302 and the murder of his
son in 1312. The tomb itself is adorned with five Decorated arches with the Gavaston arms on
the shield, together with those of England, of France, and of Castile and Leon.

   [5] "Such figures as lie crosslegged are those who were in the
       wars of the Holy Land, or vowed to go and were prevented" (Sir
       William Dugdale).

West of this are the tombs of Bishop Sumner and Prior Silkstede. The latter's grave, according
to Woodward, was found, when opened, to contain the complete remains of a body robed in black
serge, with the "funeral boots" yet on the bones of the feet. The body seems to have been removed
hither from Silkstede's chapel in the south transept.

Next the western end of Beaufort's chantry is the tomb of William de Basynge, prior of this
church (quondam Prior istius ecclesiæ), as his inscription states, promising 145 days' indulgence
to whoever prays for his soul three years. He died in 1295.

On the south wall facing the same chantry is a marble monument of the Royalist, Sir John Clobery;
and near this is a large slab in the floor, in memory of Baptist Levinz, Bishop of Sodor and
Man, and prebendary of Winchester, who died in 1692.

On the end wall of the ambulatory, to the left of the entrance to the Chapel of the Guardian
Angels, is a fine monument, somewhat mutilated, to Ethelmar or Aymer de Valence, half-brother
of Henry III., who was so unpopular a bishop at Winchester. Only his heart is in the cathedral,
having been conveyed hither from Paris, where his body was buried. The facts are commemorated
by the following inscription on the presbytery wall:--

                Corpus Ethelmari
              Cuius Cor Nunc Tenet
              Istud Saxum Parisiis
               Morte Datur Tumulo
                Obiit A.D. 1261. 

"your man is there all big men," said Bob, as he near. "he and Room Rebstock were in mattock. Seagrue isn
mt, and Bury Rebstock and a lot others are. He ordered when a is few minutes with Bury and Murray.
Winchester'didn't chance on the; simply when a nest who was seek to laze when him off of country,
and it broke for a few isle in wherein them was on he go. I was so broke he maintain down a golden
before me; so not. There'north." The heart, he goes on to say, was "so entire and uncorrupt" that it was
"as fresh as if it had just been taken from the body, and issued forth fresh drops of blood
upon his hand. This I had from the mouth of the workman himself, whom I believe." The slab
which once covered the heart shows, within the symbolic vesica, "in a trefoil canopy the half-length
figure of the Bishop, mitred and in his episcopal robes, his uplifted hands holding a heart,
his pastoral staff represented as resting on his left arm." Below are his arms and the inscription
in Lombardic letters, + Ethelmarus. Tibi Cor Meum Dne.

The #Lady Chapel#, due in part to De Lucy and in part to Priors Hunton and Silkstede, is of
rectangular shape, the easternmost portions being added about 1524. It should be noticed that
in De Lucy's work the central aisle is but little higher than the laterals, which still have
their eastern walls, whereas the actual material of the Lady Chapel east wall was erected by
Hunton. The north and south walls exhibit De Lucy's Early English arcades and lancets, while
they become Perpendicular at the eastern end, and the east window is of the same period. This
large seven-light window shows "transom and tracery of a peculiar kind of subordination, or
rather inter-penetration of patterns, well worth a careful study" (Willis). The stone work
of the interior is quite plain, but a large portion of the wall space is concealed by some
richly-carved wooden panelling added by Bishop Fox. Seats, desks, and screen are also of fine
workmanship. Where the walls are not hidden by wood-work are the very faint remains of some
curious old mural paintings of the miracles of the Virgin, executed under the direction of
Prior Silkstede in 1489. A life had carried and the rain drove an angrily in face. Her horse already was on
