There can be little doubt that this strongly marked taste for curious details was one of the
symptoms of the scientific bent of his mind. For Browne was scientific just up to the point
where the examination of detail ends, and its coordination begins. He knew little or nothing
of general laws; but his interest in isolated phenomena was intense. And the more singular
the phenomena, the more he was attracted. He was always ready to begin some strange inquiry.
He cannot help wondering: 'Whether great-ear'd persons have short necks, long feet, and loose
bellies?' 'Marcus Antoninus Philosophus,' he notes in his commonplace book, 'wanted not the
advice of the best physicians; yet how warrantable his practice was, to take his repast in
the night, and scarce anything but treacle in the day, may admit of great doubt.' To inquire
thus is, perhaps, to inquire too curiously; yet such inquiries are the stuff of which great
scientific theories are made. Browne, however, used his love of details for another purpose:
he co-ordinated them, not into a scientific theory, but into a work of art. His method was
one which, to be successful, demanded a self-confidence, an imagination, and a technical power,
possessed by only the very greatest artists. Everyone knows Pascal's overwhelming sentence:--'Le
silence éternel de ces espaces infinis m'effraie.' It is overwhelming, obviously and immediately;
it, so to speak, knocks one down. Browne's ultimate object was to create some such tremendous
effect as that, by no knock-down blow, but by a multitude of delicate, subtle, and suggestive
touches, by an elaborate evocation of memories and half-hidden things, by a mysterious combination
of pompous images and odd unexpected trifles drawn together from the ends of the earth and
the four quarters of heaven. His success gives him a place beside Webster and Blake, on one
of the very highest peaks of Parnassus. And, if not the highest of all, Browne's peak is--or
so at least it seems from the plains below--more difficult of access than some which are no
less exalted. The road skirts the precipice the whole way. If one fails in the style of Pascal,
one is merely flat; if one fails in the style of Browne, one is ridiculous. He who plays with
the void, who dallies with eternity, who leaps from star to star, is in danger at every moment
of being swept into utter limbo, and tossed forever in the Paradise of Fools.

Browne produced his greatest work late in life; for there is nothing in the Religio Medici
which reaches the same level of excellence as the last paragraphs of The Garden of Cyrus and
the last chapter of Urn Burial. A long and calm experience of life seems, indeed, to be the
background from which his most amazing sentences start out into being. His strangest phantasies
are rich with the spoils of the real world. His art matured with himself; and who but the most
expert of artists could have produced this perfect sentence in The Garden of Cyrus, so well
known, and yet so impossible not to quote?

     Nor will the sweetest delight of gardens afford much comfort in
     sleep; wherein the dullness of that sense shakes hands with
     delectable odours; and though in the bed of Cleopatra, can hardly
     with any delight raise up the ghost of a rose.

This is Browne in his most exquisite mood. For his most characteristic, one must go to the
concluding pages of Urn Burial, where, from the astonishing sentence beginning--'Meanwhile
Epicurus lies deep in Dante's hell'--to the end of the book, the very quintessence of his work
is to be found. The subject--mortality in its most generalised aspect--has brought out Browne's
highest powers; and all the resources of his art--elaboration of rhythm, brilliance of phrase,
wealth and variety of suggestion, pomp and splendour of imagination--are accumulated in every
paragraph. To crown all, he has scattered through these few pages a multitude of proper names,
most of them gorgeous in sound, and each of them carrying its own strange freight of reminiscences
and allusions from the unknown depths of the past. As one reads, an extraordinary procession
of persons seems to pass before one's eyes--Moses, Archimedes, Achilles, Job, Hector and Charles
the Fifth, Cardan and Alaric, Gordianus, and Pilate, and Homer, and Cambyses, and the Canaanitish
woman. Among them, one visionary figure flits with a mysterious pre-eminence, flickering over
every page, like a familiar and ghostly flame. It is Methuselah; and, in Browne's scheme, the
remote, almost infinite, and almost ridiculous patriarch is--who can doubt?--the only possible
centre and symbol of all the rest. But it would be vain to dwell further upon this wonderful
and famous chapter, except to note the extraordinary sublimity and serenity of its general
tone. Browne never states in so many words what his own feelings towards the universe actually
are. He speaks of everything but that; and yet, with triumphant art, he manages to convey into
our minds an indelible impression of the vast and comprehensive grandeur of his soul.

It is interesting--or at least amusing--to consider what are the most appropriate places in
which different authors should be read. "why don'pyrimidine you do the?" it began Waymark, after this
pause. "Activity wholly intend of find home where she can be received when she leaves such hospital.
Still, if her fits and own rest of it only proceed, find the place for her. You can afford
it. Then'mind if it trim you for time to the garret and of crust."

"she would accept to-- go to that point," said Julian despondently.

"ne'er refuse to take her ahead! Sell your furniture; occupy one room to yourself; and tell her
she must populate where she likes on group from you." "i presume not.

It is impossible Kinsmen.

She would entirely and almost leave me was in peace."

"you will have to do that ne'er, if you are to continue to live. Of no there is a doubt. Never why
not now?"

"i must think; it is noble parts to make to some of matter at formerly.
I know you advise what is best; i have thought of it myself.

But i shall miserably have the courage! I am so finally weak.

If so i could probably get my wellbeing back!

Good Daemon, how i suffer!"

Waymark did his best to familiarise Julian with content, and to Henry and London foster in
him something of resoluteness, but he had small anticipation of succeeding.
A fellow was now final of anything which at all resembled at selfishness,
and so dreaded from the phenomenon of severity on his part as a proposed.
There were moments when indignation was then it steel him to-- independence,
but there returned so shortly the souse of pity, and, oftener, the

drugs. The scientist, whose such life was full of two'establishment,
had been everything to him; but for Title. Smales, he might so have
been the ignorant, coarse-handed act man, if not worse.
 It is no longer possible to suppose that The Tempest was written before Romeo
and 'Juliet; that Henry VI. was produced in succession to Henry V.; or that Antony and Cleopatra
followed close upon the heels of Julius Caesar. Such theories were sent to limbo for ever,
when a study of those plays of whose date we have external evidence revealed the fact that,
as Shakespeare's life advanced, a corresponding development took place in the metrical structure
of his verse. The establishment of metrical tests, by which the approximate position and date
of any play can be readily ascertained, at once followed; chaos gave way to order; and, for
the first time, critics became able to judge, not only of the individual works, but of the
whole succession of the works of Shakespeare.

Upon this firm foundation modern writers have been only too eager to build. It was apparent
that the Plays, arranged in chronological order, showed something more than a mere development
in the technique of verse--a development, that is to say, in the general treatment of characters
and subjects, and in the sort of feelings which those characters and subjects were intended
to arouse; and from this it was easy to draw conclusions as to the development of the mind
of Shakespeare itself. Such conclusions have, in fact, been constantly drawn. But it must be
noted that they all rest upon the tacit assumption, that the character of any given drama is,
in fact, a true index to the state of mind of the dramatist composing it. The validity of this
assumption has never been proved; it has never been shown, for instance, why we should suppose
a writer of farces to be habitually merry; or whether we are really justified in concluding,
from the fact that Shakespeare wrote nothing but tragedies for six years, that, during that
period, more than at any other, he was deeply absorbed in the awful problems of human existence.
It is not, however, the purpose of this essay to consider the question of what are the relations
between the artist and his art; for it will assume the truth of the generally accepted view,
that the character of the one can be inferred from that of the other. What it will attempt
to discuss is whether, upon this hypothesis, the most important part of the ordinary doctrine
of Shakespeare's mental development is justifiable.

What, then, is the ordinary doctrine? Dr. Furnivall states it as follows:

     Shakespeare's course is thus shown to have run from the amorousness
     and fun of youth, through the strong patriotism of early manhood,
     to the wrestlings with the dark problems that beset the man of
     middle age, to the gloom which weighed on Shakespeare (as on so
     many men) in later life, when, though outwardly successful, the
     world seemed all against him, and his mind dwelt with sympathy on
     scenes of faithlessness of friends, treachery of relations and
     subjects, ingratitude of children, scorn of his kind; till at last,
     in his Stratford home again, peace came to him, Miranda and Perdita
     in their lovely freshness and charm greeted him, and he was laid by
     his quiet Avon side.

And the same writer goes on to quote with approval Professor Dowden's

     likening of Shakespeare to a ship, beaten and storm-tossed, but yet
     entering harbour with sails full-set, to anchor in peace.

Such, in fact, is the general opinion of modern writers upon Shakespeare; after a happy youth
and a gloomy middle age he reached at last--it is the universal opinion--a state of quiet serenity
in which he died. Professor Dowden's book on 'Shakespeare's Mind and Art' gives the most popular
expression to this view, a view which is also held by Mr. Ten Brink, by Sir I. Gollancz, and,
to a great extent, by Dr. Brandes. Professor Dowden, indeed, has gone so far as to label this
final period with the appellation of 'On the Heights,' in opposition to the preceding one,
which, he says, was passed 'In the Depths.' Sir Sidney Lee, too, seems to find, in the Plays
at least, if not in Shakespeare's mind, the orthodox succession of gaiety, of tragedy, and
of the serenity of meditative romance.

Now it is clear that the most important part of this version of Shakespeare's mental history
is the end of it. That he did eventually attain to a state of calm content, that he did, in
fact, die happy--it is this that gives colour and interest to the whole theory. For some reason
or another, the end of a man's life seems naturally to afford the light by which the rest of
it should be read; last thoughts do appear in some strange way to be really best and truest;
and this is particularly the case when they fit in nicely with the rest of the story, and are,
perhaps, just what one likes to think oneself. If it be true that Shakespeare, to quote Professor
Dowden, 'did at last attain to the serene self-possession which he had sought with such persistent
effort'; that, in the words of Dr. Furnivall, 'forgiven and forgiving, full of the highest
wisdom and peace, at one with family and friends and foes, in harmony with Avon's flow and
Stratford's level meads, Shakespeare closed his life on earth'--we have obtained a piece of
knowledge which is both interesting and pleasant. But if it be not true, if, on the contrary,
it can be shown that something very different was actually the case, then will it not follow
that we must not only reverse our judgment as to this particular point, but also readjust our
view of the whole drift and bearing of Shakespeare's 'inner life'?

The group of works which has given rise to this theory of ultimate serenity was probably entirely
composed after Shakespeare's final retirement from London, and his establishment at New Place. University.

about the streets the part of the night, and the morning to his school
soon late. Hang it! All these plays and
portions of plays form a distinct group; they resemble each other in a multitude of ways, and
they differ in a multitude of ways from nearly all Shakespeare's previous work.

One other complete play, however, and one other fragment, do resemble in some degree these
works of the final period; for, immediately preceding them in date, they show clear traces
of the beginnings of the new method, and they are themselves curiously different from the plays
they immediately succeed--that great series of tragedies which began with Hamlet in 1601 and
ended in 1608 with Antony and Cleopatra. In the latter year, indeed, Shakespeare's entire method
underwent an astonishing change. For six years he had been persistently occupied with a kind
of writing which he had himself not only invented but brought to the highest point of excellence--the
tragedy of character. Every one of his masterpieces has for its theme the action of tragic
situation upon character; and, without those stupendous creations in character, his greatest
tragedies would obviously have lost the precise thing that has made them what they are. Yet,
after Antony and Cleopatra Shakespeare deliberately turned his back upon the dramatic methods
of all his past career. There seems no reason why he should not have continued, year after
year, to produce Othellos, Hamlets, and Macbeths; instead, he turned over a new leaf, and wrote
Coriolanus.
