His father made no reproaches, but was grievously disappointed.  His exaggerated estimate of
his son's discretion had given place to a no less misplaced despondency, quite inaccessible
to Mrs. Ponsonby's consolations as to the spirit that had prompted the performance.  He could
have better understood a youth being unable to forego the exhibition of a handsome person and
dress, than imagine that any one of moderate sense could either expect the invasion, or use
these means of averting it.  If imagination was to be allowed for, so much the worse. One effect remembered

A HALTING PROPOSAL.

  Shallow.  Will you upon good dowry, marry her?
  Slender.  I will do a greater thing than that, upon your request.
                                  Merry Wives of Windsor.

The first thing that Louis did appear to care for was a letter that arrived about three days
previous to their departure, addressed to 'Lord Fitsgosling, Hawmsfield Park, Northwold.' 
Rather too personal, as he observed, he must tell his correspondent that it hurt his feelings.
The correspondent was Tom Madison, whose orthography lagged behind his other attainments, if
his account might be trusted of 'they lectures on Kemistry.'  His penmanship was much improved,
and he was prospering, with hopes of promotion and higher wages, when he should have learnt
to keep accounts.  He liked Mr. Dobbs and the chaplain, and wished to know how to send a crown
per post to 'old granfer up at Marksedge; because he is too ignorant to get a border sinned.
Please, my lord, give my duty to him and all enquiring friends, and to Schirlt, up at the Teras.'

Highly amused, Louis lay on the uppermost step from the library window, in the cool summer
evening, laughing over the letter. 'There, Aunt Kitty, he said, 'I commit that tender greeting
to your charge,' and as she looked doubtful, 'Yes, do, there's a good aunt and mistress.'

'I am afraid I should not be a good mistress; I ought not to sanction it.'

'Better sanction it above board than let it go on by stealth,' said Louis.  'You are her natural
protector.'

'So much the more reason against it!  I ought to wish her to forget this poor boy of yours.'

'Ay, and light Hymen's torch with some thriving tallow chandler, who would marry a domestic
slave as a good speculation, without one spark of the respectful chivalrous love that--'

'Hush! you absurd boy.'

'Well, then, if you won't, I shall go to Jane.  The young ladies are all too cold and too prudent,
but Jane has a soft spot in her heart, and will not think true love is confined within the
rank that keeps a gig.  I did think Aunt Kitty had been above vulgar prejudices.'

'Not above being coaxed by you, you gosling, you,' said Aunt Kitty; 'only you must come out
of the dew, the sun is quite gone.'

'Presently,' said Louis, as she retreated by the window.

'I would not have been too cold or too prudent!' said Clara.

'I well believe it!'

'You will be one if you are not the other,' said Mary, gathering her work up, with the dread
of one used to tropical dews.  'Are not you coming in?'

'When I can persuade myself to write a letter of good advice, a thing I hate.'

'Which,' asked Mary; 'giving or receiving it?'

'Receiving, of course.'--'Giving, of course,' said Clara and Louis at the same instant.

'Take mine, then,' said Mary, 'and come out of the damp.'

'Mary is so tiresome about these things!' cried Clara, as their cousin retreated.  'Such fidgetting
nonsense.'

'I once argued it with her,' said Louis, without stirring; 'and she had the right side, that
it is often more self-denying to take care of one's health, than to risk it for mere pleasure
or heedlessness.'

'There's no dew!' said Clara; 'and if there was, it would not hurt, and if it did, I should
be too glad to catch a cold, or something to keep me at home.  Oh, if I could only get into
a nice precarious state of health!'

'You would soon wish yourself at school, or anywhere else, so that you could feel some life
in your limbs,' half sighed Louis.

'I've more than enough!  Oh! how my feet ache to run! and my throat feels stifled for want
of making a noise, and the hatefulness of always sitting upright, with my shoulders even! 
Come, you might pity me a little this one night, Louis: I know you do, for Jem is always telling
me not to let you set me against it.'

'No, I don't pity you.  Pity is next akin to contempt.'

'Nonsense, Louis.  Do be in earnest.'

'I have seldom seen the human being whom I could presume to pity: certainly not you, bravely
resisting folly and temptation, and with so dear and noble a cause for working.'

'You mean, the hope of helping to maintain grandmamma.'

'Which you will never be able to do, unless you pass through this ordeal, and qualify yourself
for skilled labour.'

'I know that,' said Clara; 'but the atmosphere there seems to poison, and take the vigour out
of all they teach.  Oh, so different from granny teaching me my notes, or Jem teaching me French--'

'Growling at you--'

'He never growled half as much as, I deserved.  I cared to learn of him; but I don't care for
anything now,--no, not for drawing, which you taught me!  There's no heart in it!  The whole
purpose is to get amazing numbers of marks and pass each other.  All dates and words, and gabble
gabble!'

'Ay! there's an epitome of the whole world: all ambition, and vanity, and gabble gabble,' said
Louis, sadly.  'And what is a gosling, that he should complain?'

'You don't mean that in reality.  You are always merry.

'Some mirth is because one does not always think, Clara; and when one does think deeply enough,
there is better cheerfulness.'

'Deeply enough,' said Clara.  'Ah! I see.  Knowing that the world of gabble is not what we
belong to, only a preparation?  Is that it!'

'It is what I meant.'

'Ah I but how to make that knowledge help us.'

'There's the point.  Now and then, I think I see; but then I go off on a wrong tack: I get
a silly fit, and a hopeless one, and lose my clue. And yet, after all, there is a highway;
and wayfaring men, though fools, shall not err therein,' murmured Louis, as he gazed on the
first star of evening.

'Oh! tell me how to see my highway at school!'

'If I only kept my own at home, I might.  But you have the advantage--you have a fixed duty,
and you always have kept hold of your purposes much better than I.'

'My purpose!' said Clara.  'I suppose that is to learn as fast as I can, that I may get away
from that place, and not be a burthen to granny and Jem.  Perhaps Jem will marry and be poor,
and then I shall send his sons to school and college.'

'And pray what are your social duties till that time comes?'

'That's plain enough,' said Clara: 'to keep my tone from being deteriorated by these girls.
Why, Louis, what's that for?' as, with a bow and air of alarm, he hastily moved aside from her.

'If you are so much afraid of being deteriorated--'

'Nonsense!  If you only once saw their trumpery cabals, and vanities, and mean equivocations,
you would understand that the only thing to be done is to keep clear of them; take the learning
I am sent for, but avoid them!'

'And where is the golden rule all this time?' said Louis, very low.

'But ought not one to keep out of what is wrong?'

'Yes, but not to stand aloof from what is not wrong.  Look out, not for what is inferior to
yourself, but what is superior.  Ah! you despair; but, my Giraffe, will you promise me this?
Tell me, next Christmas, a good quality for every bad one you have found in them. You shake
your head.  Nay, you must, for the credit of your sex.  I never found the man in whom there
was not something to admire, and I had rather not suppose that women are not better than men.
Will you promise?'

'I'll try, but--'

'But, mind, it takes kind offices to bring the blossoms out. There--that's pretty well, considering
our mutual sentiments as to good advice.'

'Have you been giving me good advice?'

'Not bad, I hope.'

'I thought only people like--like Mary--could give advice.'

'Ah! your blindness about Mary invalidates your opinion of your schoolfellows.  It shows that
you do not deserve a good friend.'

'I've got you; I want no other.'

'Quite wrong.  Not only is she full of clear, kind, solid sense, like a pillar to lean on,
but she could go into detail with you in your troubles.  You have thrown away a great opportunity,
and I am afraid I helped you.  I shall hold you in some esteem when you are--to conclude sententiously--worthy
of her friendship.'

Clara's laugh was loud enough to bring out the Earl, to summon them authoritatively out of
the dew.  Louis sat apart, writing his letter; Clara, now and then, hovering near, curious
to hear how he had corrected Tom's spelling.  He had not finished, when the ladies bade him
good-night; and, as he proceeded with it, his father said, 'What is that engrossing correspondence,
Louis?'

'Such a sensible letter, that I am quite ashamed of it,' said Louis.

'I wonder at the time you chose for writing, when you are so soon to part with our guests.'

'I have no excuse, if you think it uncivil.  I never have spirit to set about anything till
the sun is down.'

His father began at once to speak softly: 'No, I intended no blame; I only cannot but wonder
to see you so much engrossed with Clara Dynevor.'

'Poor child! she wants some compensation.'

'I have no doubt of your kind intentions; but it would be safer to consider what construction
may be placed on attentions so exclusive.'

Louis looked up in blank, incredulous amazement, and then almost laughingly exclaimed, 'Is
that what you mean?  Why, she is an infant, a baby--'

'Not in appearance--'

'You don't know her, father,' said Louis.  'I love her with all my heart, and could not do
more.  Why, she is, and always has been, my she-younger-brother!'

'I am aware,' said the Earl, without acknowledging this peculiar relationship, 'that this may
appear very ridiculous, but experience has shown the need of caution.  I should be concerned
that your heedless good-nature should be misconstrued, so as to cause pain and disappointment
to her, or to lead you to neglect one who has every claim to your esteem and gratitude.'

Louis was bewildered.  'I have been a wretch lately,' he said, 'but I did not know I had been
a bear.'

'I did not mean that you could be deficient in ordinary courtesy; but I had hoped for more
than mere indifferent civility towards one eminently calculated--' Lord Ormersfield for once
failed in his period.

'Are we talking at cross purposes?' exclaimed Fitzjocelyn.  'What have I been doing, or not doing?'

'If my meaning require explanation, it is needless to attempt any.-- Is your ankle painful
to-night?'

Not a word more, except about his health, could Louis extract, and he went to his room in extreme
perplexity.  Again and again did he revolve those words.  Quick as were his perceptions on
most points, they were slow where self-consciousness or personal vanity might have sharpened
them; and it was new light to him that he had come to a time of life that could attach meaning
to his attentions.

Whom had he been neglecting?  What had his father been hoping?  Who was eminently calculated,
and for what?

It flashed upon him all at once.  'I see! I see!' he cried, and burst into a laugh.

Then came consternation, or something very like it.  He did not want to feel embarked in manhood.
And then his far-away dream of a lady-love had been so transcendently fair, so unequalled in
grace, so perfect in accomplishments, so enthusiastic in self-devoted charity, all undefined,
floating on his imagination in misty tints of glory! That all this should be suddenly brought
down from cloudland, to sink into Mary Ponsonby, with the honest face and downright manner
for whom romance and rapture would be positively ridiculous!

Yet the notion would not be at once dismissed.  His declaration that he would do anything to
gratify his father had been too sincere for him lightly to turn from his suggestion, especially
at a moment when he was full of shame at his own folly, and eagerness to retain the ground
he had lost in his father's opinion, and, above all, to make him happy. His heart thrilled
and glowed as he thought of giving his father real joy, and permanently brightening and enlivening
that lonely, solitary life.  Besides, who could so well keep the peace between him and his
father, and save him by hints and by helpfulness from giving annoyance? He had already learnt
to depend on her; she entered into all his interests, and was a most pleasant companion--so
wise and good, that the most satisfactory days of his life had been passed under her management,
and he had only broken from it to 'play the fool.'  He was sick of his own volatile Quixotism,
and could believe it a relief to be kept in order without trusting to his own judgment.  She
had every right to his esteem and affection, and the warm feeling he had for her could only
be strengthened by closer ties.  The unworldliness of the project likewise weighed with him.
Had she been a millionaire or a Duke's daughter, he would not have spent one thought on the
matter; but he was touched by seeing how his father's better feelings had conquered all desire
for fortune or connexion.

And then Mary could always find everything he wanted!

'I will do it!' he determined.  'Never was son more bound to consider his father.  Of course,
she will make a much better wife than I deserve.  Most likely, my fancies would never have
been fulfilled. She will save me from my own foolishness.  What ought a man to wish for more
than a person sure to make him good?  And--well, after all, it cannot be for a long time. 
They must write to Lima.  Perhaps they will wait till her father's return, or at least till
I have taken my degree.'

This last encouraging reflection always wound up the series that perpetually recurred throughout
that night of broken sleep; and when he rose in the morning, he felt as if each waking had
added a year to his life, and looked at the glass to see whether he had not grown quite elderly.

'No, indeed!  I am ridiculously youthful, especially since I shaved off my moustache in my
rage at the Yeomanry mania!  I must systematically burn my cheeks, to look anything near her
age!'  And he laughed at himself, but ended with a long-drawn sigh. 

I not unfrequently happens that Mussulman postdate a juvenile, and vice versâ. Again, a man cuts
the whisker of child, and anything thus correspond himself the'Yeomanry,'but, to the grade, am i
presume the sigh of a sigh.  Last night I did not catch your meaning at once.'

'We will say no more about it,' was the kind answer.  'If you cannot turn your thoughts in
that direction, there is an end of the matter.'

'I think,' said Louis, 'that I could.'

'My dear boy,' said the Earl, with more eagerness than he could quite control, 'you must not
imagine that I wish to influence your inclinations unduly; but I must confess that what I have
seen for the last few months, has convinced me that nothing could better secure your happiness.'

'I believe so,' said Louis, gazing from the window.

'Right,' cried the Earl, with more gladness and warmth than his son had ever seen in him; 
'I am delighted that you appreciate such sterling excellence!  Yes, Louis,' and his voice grew
thick, 'there is nothing else to trust to.'

'I know it,' said Louis.  'She is very good.  She made me very happy when I was ill.'

'You have seen her under the most favourable circumstances.  It is the only sort of acquaintance
to be relied on.  You have consulted your own happiness far more than if you had allowed yourself
to be attracted by mere showy gifts.'

'I am sure she will do me a great deal of good,' said Louis, still keeping his eyes fixed on
the evergreens.

'You could have done nothing to give me more pleasure!' said the Earl, with heartfelt earnestness.
'I know what she is, and what her mother has been to me.  That aunt of hers is a stiff, wrongheaded
person, but she has brought her up well--very well, and her mother has done the rest.  As to
her father, that is a disadvantage; but, from what I hear, he is never likely to come home;
and that is not to be weighed against what she is herself.  Poor Mary! how rejoiced she will
be, that her daughter at least should no longer be under that man's power!  It is well you
have not been extravagant, like some young men, Louis.  If you had been running into debt,
I should not have been able to gratify your wishes now; but the property is so nearly disencumbered,
that you can perfectly afford to marry her, with the very fair fortune she must have, unless
her father should gamble it away in Peru.'

This was for Lord Ormersfield the incoherency of joy, and Louis was quite carried along by
his delight.  The breakfast-bell rang, and the Earl rising and drawing his son's arm within
his own, pressed it, saying, 'Bless you, Louis!' It was extreme surprise and pleasure to Fitzjocelyn,
and yet the next moment he recollected that he stood committed.

How silent he was--how unusually gentle and gracious his father to the whole party! quite affectionate
to Mary, and not awful even to Clara. There was far too much meaning in it, and Louis feared
Mrs. Ponsonby was seeing through all.

'A morning of Greek would be insupportable,' thought he; and yet he felt as if the fetters
of fate were being fast bound around him, when he heard his father inviting James to ride with him.

He wandered and he watched, he spoke absently to Clara, but felt as if robbed of a protector,
when she was summoned up-stairs to attend to her packing, and Mary remained alone, writing
one of her long letters to Lima.

'Now or never,' thought he, 'before my courage cools.  I never saw my father in such spirits!'

He sat down on an ottoman opposite to her, and turned over some newspapers with a restless
rustling.

'Can I fetch anything for you?' asked Mary, looking up.

'No, thank you.  You are a great deal too good to me, Mary.'

'I am glad,' said Mary, absently, anxious to go on with her letter; but, looking up again at
him--'I am sure you want something.'

'No--nothing--but that you should be still more good to me.'

'What is the matter?' said Mary, suspecting that he was beginning to repent of his lazy fit,
and wanted her to hear his confession.

'I mean, Mary,' said he, rising, and speaking faster, 'if you--if you would take charge of
me altogether.  If you would have me, I would do all I could to make you happy, and it would
be such joy to my father, and--'(rather like an after-thought)'to me.'

Her clear, sensible eyes were raised, and her colour deepened, but the confusion was on the
gentleman's side--she was too much amazed to feel embarrassment, and there was a pause, till
he added, 'I know better than to think myself worthy of you; but you will take me in hand--and,
indeed, Mary, there is no one whom I like half so well.'

Poor Louis! was this his romantic and poetical wooing!

'Stop, if you please, Louis!' exclaimed Mary.  'This is so very strange!'  And she seemed ready
to laugh.

'And--what do you say, Mary?'

'I do not know.  I cannot tell what I ought to say,' she returned, rising.  'Will you let me
go to mamma?'

She went; and Louis roamed about restlessly, till, on the stairs, he encountered Mrs. Frost,
who instantly exclaimed, 'Why, my dear, what is the matter with you?'

'I have been proposing to Mary,' said he, in a very low murmur, his eyes downcast, but raised
the next moment, to see the effect, as if it had been a piece of mischief.

'Well--proposing what?'

'Myself;' most innocently whispered.

'You!--you!--Mary!--And--' Aunt Catharine was scarcely able to speak, in the extremity of her
astonishment.  'You are not in earnest!'

'She is gone to her mother,' said Louis, hanging over the baluster, so as to look straight
down into the hall; and both were silent, till Mrs. Frost exclaimed, 'My dear, dear child,
it is an excellent choice!  You must be very happy with her!'

'Yes, I found my father was bent on it.'

'That was clear enough,' said his aunt, laughing, but resuming a tone of some perplexity. 
'Yet it takes me by surprise: I had not guessed that you were so much attracted.'

'I do like her better than any one.  No one is so thoroughly good, no one is likely to make
me so good, nor my father so happy.'

There was some misgiving in Mrs. Frost's tone, as she said, 'Dear Louis, you are acting on
the best of motives, but--'

'Don't, pray don't, Aunt Kitty,' cried Louis, rearing himself for an instant to look her in
the face, but again throwing half his body over the rail, and speaking low.  'I could not meet
any one half so good, or whom I know as well.  I look up to her, and--yes--I do love her heartily--I
would not have done it otherwise.  I don't care for beauty and trash, and my father has set
his heart on it.'

'Yes, but--' she hesitated.  'My dear, I don't think it safe to marry, because one's father
has set his heart on it.'

'Indeed,' said Louis, straightening himself, 'I do think I am giving myself the best chance
of being made rational and consistent.  I never did so well as when I was under her.'

'N--n--no--but--'

'And think how my father will unbend in a homelike home, where all should be made up to him,'
he continued, deep emotion swelling his voice.

'My dear boy!  And you are sure of your own feeling?'

'Quite sure.  Why, I never saw any one,' said he, smiling--'I never cared for any one half
so much, except you, Aunt Kitty, no, I didn't. Won't that do?'

'I know I should not have liked your grandpapa--your uncle, I mean-to make such comparisons.'

'Perhaps he had not got an Aunt Kitty,' said Louis.

'No, no!  I can't have you so like a novel.  No, don't be anxious. It can't be for ever so
long, and, of course, the more I am with her, the better I must like her.  It will be all right.'

'I don't think you know anything about it,' said Mrs. Frost, 'but there, that's the last I
shall say.  You'll forgive your old aunt.'

He smiled, and playfully pressed her hand, adding, 'But we don't know whether she will have me.'

Mary had meantime entered her mother's room, with a look that revealed the whole to Mrs. Ponsonby,
who had already been somewhat startled by the demeanour of the father and son at breakfast.

'Oh, mamma, what is to be done?'

'What do you wish, my child?' asked her mother, putting her arm round her waist.

'I don't know yet,' said Mary.  'It is so odd!'  And the disposition to laugh returned for
a moment.

'You were not at all prepared.'

'Oh no!  He seems so young.  And,' she added, blushing, 'I cannot tell, but I should not have
thought his ways were like the kind of thing.'

'Nor I, and the less since Clara has been here.'

'Oh,' said Mary, without a shade on her calm, sincere brow, 'he has Clara so much with him
because he is her only friend.'

The total absence of jealousy convinced Mrs. Ponsonby that the heart could hardly have been
deeply touched, but Mary continued, in a slightly trembling voice, 'I do not see why he should
have done this, unless--'

'Unless that his father wished it.'

'Oh,' said Mary, somewhat disappointed, 'but how could Lord Ormersfield possibly--'

'He has an exceeding dread of Louis's making as great a mistake as he did,' said Mrs. Ponsonby;
'and perhaps he thinks you the best security.'

'And you think Louis only meant to please him?'

'My dear, I am afraid it may be so.  Louis is very fond of him, and easily led by a strong
character.'

She pressed her daughter closer, and felt rather than heard a little sigh; but all that Mary
said was, 'Then I had better not think about it.'

'Nay, my dear, tell me first what you think of his manner.'

'It was strange, and a little debonnaire, I think,' said Mary, smiling, but tears gathering
in her eyes.  'He said I was too good for him.  He said he would make me happy, and that he
and his father would be very happy.'  A great tear fell.  'Something about not being worthy.'
Mary shed a few more tears, while her mother silently caressed her; and, recovering her composure,
she firmly said, 'Yes, mamma, I see it is not the real thing.  It will be kinder to him to
tell him to put it out of his head.'

'And you, my dear?'

'Oh, mamma, you know you could not spare me.'

'If this were the real thing, dearest--'

'No,' whispered Mary, 'I could not leave you alone with papa.'

Mrs. Ponsonby went on as if she had not heard: 'As it is, I own I am relieved that you should
not wish to accept him.  I cannot be sure it would be for your happiness.'

'I do not think it would be right,' said Mary, as if that were her strength.

By the time they reached the drawing-room, he had recovered himself so as to come forward in
a very suitable, simple manner, and Mary said, at once, 'Louis, thank you; but we think it
would be better not--'

'Not!' exclaimed Fitzjocelyn.

'Not,' repeated Mary; 'I do not think there is that between us which would make it right.'

'There would be!' cried Louis, gaining ardour by the difficulty, 'if you would only try.  Mrs.
Ponsonby, tell her we would make her happy.'

'You would try,' said Mrs. Ponsonby, kindly; 'but I think she is right. Indeed, Louis, you
must forgive me for saying that you are hardly old enough to make up your mind--'

'Madison is younger,' said Louis, boyishly enough to make her smile, but earnestly proceeding,
'Won't you try me?  Will you not say that if I can be steady and persevering--'

'No,' said Mrs. Ponsonby; 'it would not be fair towards either of you to make any conditions.'

'But if without them, I should do better--Mary, will you say nothing?'

'We had better not think of it,' said Mary, her eyes on the ground.

'Why? is it that I am too foolish, too unworthy?'

She made a great effort.  'Not that, Louis.  Do not ask any more; it is better not; you have
done as your father wished--now let us be as we were before.'

'My father will be very much disappointed,' said Louis, with chagrin.

'I will take care of your father,' said Mrs. Ponsonby, and as Mary took the moment for escaping,
she proceeded to say some affectionate words of her own tender feeling towards Louis; to which
he only replied by saying, sadly, and with some mortification, 'Never mind; I know it is quite
right.  I am not worthy of her.'

'That is not the point; but I do not think you understand your own feelings, or how far you
were actuated by the wish to gratify your father.'

'I assure you,' cried Louis, 'you do not guess how I look up to Mary; her unfailing kindness,
her entering into all my nonsense--her firm, sound judgment, that would keep me right--and
all she did for me when I was laid up.  Oh! why cannot you believe how dear she is to me?'

'How dear is just what I do believe; but still this is not enough.'

'Just what Aunt Kitty says,' said Louis, perplexed, yet amused at his own perplexity.

'You will know better by-and-by,' she answered, smiling: 'in the meantime, believe that you
are our very dear cousin, as ever.'  And she shook hands with him, detecting in his answering
smile a little relief, although a great deal of disappointment.

Mary had taken refuge in her room, where a great shower of tears would have their course, though
she scolded herself all the time. 'Have done! have done!  It is best as it is.  He does not
really wish it, and I could not leave mamma.  We will never think of it again, and we will
be as happy as we were before.'

Her mother, meanwhile, was waiting below-stairs, thinking that she should spare Louis something,
by taking the initiative in speaking to his father; and she was sorry to see the alacrity with
which the Earl came up to her, with a congratulatory 'Well, Mary!'  She could hardly make him
comprehend the real state of the case; and then his resignation was far more trying than that
of the party chiefly concerned.  Her praise of Fitzjocelyn had little power to comfort. 'I
see how it is,' he said, calmly: 'do not try to explain it away; I acquiesce--I have no doubt
you acted wisely for your daughter.'

'Nothing would have delighted me more, if he were but a few years older.'

'You need not tell me the poor boy's failings,' said his father, sadly.

'It is on account of no failing; but would it not be a great mistake to risk their happiness
to fulfil our own scheme?'

'I hoped to secure their happiness.'

'Ay, but is there not something too capricious to find happiness without its own free will
and choice?  Did you never hear of the heart?'

'Oh! if she be attached elsewhere'--and he seemed so much relieved, that Mrs. Ponsonby was
sorry to be obliged to contradict him in haste, and explain that she did not believe Fitzjocelyn's
heart to be yet developed; whereupon he was again greatly vexed.  'So he has offered himself
without attachment.  I beg your pardon, Mary; I am sorry your daughter should have been so
treated.'

'Do not misunderstand me. Towards eventide we halt at a uncontaminating moshav call greater, where the
long aunt of my search companions keep a bridgehead chosen of community
hierarch.

Having sent one of his kinsman in retreat to find him of my attainment,
he was expect to have maine, and tempt i to stay at his house with
little amity.

Notwithstanding that substance on it had been destroyed by happening a few period really, i was previously
well domiciliate, and fully appreciated the unsmooth plot after the great'shakes down'to which
i was accustomed.  Only
be patient with him.'

'You are the same Mary as ever,' he said, softened; and she left him, hoping that she had secured
a favourable audience for his son, who soon appeared at the window, somewhat like a culprit.

'I could not help it!' he said.

'No; but you may set a noble aim before you--you may render yourself worthy of her esteem and
confidence, and in so doing you will fulfil my fondest hopes.'

'I asked her to try me, but they would make no conditions.  I am sorry this could not be, since
you wished it.'

'If you are not sorry on your own account, there are no regrets to be wasted on mine.'

'Candidly, father,' said Louis, 'much as I like her, I cannot be sorry to keep my youth and
liberty a little longer.'

'Then you should never have entered on the subject at all,' said Lord Ormersfield, beginning
to write a letter; and poor Louis, in his praiseworthy effort not to be reserved with him,
found he had been confessing that he had not only been again making a fool of himself, but,
what was less frequent and less pardonable, of his father likewise.   He limped out at the
window, and was presently found by his great-aunt, reading what he called a raving novel, to
see how he ought to have done it.  She shook her head at him, and told him that he was not
even decently concerned.

'Indeed I am,' he replied.  'I wished my father to have had some peace of mind about me, and
it does not flatter one's vanity.'

Dear, soft-hearted Aunt Kitty, with all her stores of comfort ready prepared, and unable to
forgive, or even credit, the rejection of her Louis, without a prior attachment, gave a hint
that this might be his consolation.  He caught eagerly at the idea.  'I had never once thought
of that!  It can't be any Spaniard out in Peru--she has too much sense. What are you looking
so funny about?  What! is it nearer home?  That's it, then!  Famous!  It would be a capital
arrangement, if that terrible old father is conformable.  What an escape I have had of him!
I am sure it is a most natural and proper preference--'

'Stop! stop, Louis, you are going too fast.  I know nothing.  Don't say a word to Jem, on any
account: indeed, you must not.  It is all going on very well now; but the least notion that
he was observed, or that it was his Uncle Oliver's particular wish, and there would be an end
of it.'

She was just wise enough to keep back the wishes of the other vizier, but she had said enough
to set Louis quite at his ease, and put him in the highest spirits.  He seemed to have taken
out a new lease of boyishness, and, though constrained before Mary, laughed, talked, and played
pranks, so as unconsciously to fret his father exceedingly. 

To supplement to this, and for the absence of provisions, looks, and empty thing, which his person
who had neglect to procure, and an assets, and we may not be turned that his attack is as nevertheless
disappointed. But another and would heretofore lesser past who show itself to who him. The
position which he should incompetently assume towards montenegro.
The small and most efficient argumentation to support, to feast to
acquire at birth, would have been to have been occupy and repress that
state.  'I honour the Ponsonbys,'
he said, 'for not choosing to second his lordship's endeavours to tyrannize over that poor
fellow, body and soul.  Poor Louis! he is fabulously dutiful.'

But Clara, recovering from her first stupor of wonder, began scolding him for presuming to
laugh at anything so cruel to Louis.  It was not the part of a friend!  And with tears of indignation
and sympathy starting from her eyes, she was pathetically certain that, though granny and Jem
were so unfeeling as to laugh, his high spirits were only assumed to hide his suffering.  'Poor
Louis! what had he not said to her about Mary last night!  Now she knew what he meant!  And
as to Mary, she was glad she had never liked her, she had no patience with her: of course,
she was far too prosy and stupid to care for anything like Louis, it was a great escape for
him.  It would serve her right to marry a horrid little crooked clerk in her father's office;
and poor dear, dear Louis must get over it, and have the most beautiful wife in the world.
Don't you remember, Jem, the lady with the splendid dark eyes on the platform at Euston Square,
when you so nearly made us miss the train, with the brow that you said--'

'Hush, Clara, don't talk nonsense.'

CHAPTER XII.

CHILDE ROLAND.

  A house there is, and that's enough,
  From whence one fatal morning issues
  A brace of warriors, not in buff,
  But rustling in their silks and tissues.
  The heroines undertook the task;
  Thro' lanes unknown, o'er stiles they ventured,--
  Rapped at the door, nor stayed to ask,
  But bounce into the parlour entered.
                            Gray's Long Story.

'No carmine?  Nor scarlet lake in powder?'

'Could procure some, my Lord.'
