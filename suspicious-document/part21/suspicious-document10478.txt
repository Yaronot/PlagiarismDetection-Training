'Have a care! have a care!' he cried hotly. 'You go too far, M. Berault.'

'De Berault, if you please,' I objected, eyeing him sternly. 'My family has borne the DE as

He could not deny that, and he answered, 'As you please;' at the same time restraining his
friend by a gesture. 'But none the less,' he continued, 'take my advice. The Cardinal has forbidden
duelling, and this time he means it! You have been in trouble once and gone free. A second
time it may fare worse with you. Let this gentleman go, therefore, M. de Berault. Besides--why,

Two or three who stood behind me applauded that, But I turned and they met my eye; and they
were as mum as mice.

'His age is his own concern,' I said grimly. 'He was old enough a while ago to insult me.'

I saw in the distance one of the Cardinal's guard loitering in front of the scaffolding round
the new Hotel Richelieu; and the sight of the uniform gave me pause for a moment. But it was
too late to repent.

The Englishman began at once to strip off his clothes. I closed mine to the throat, for the
air was chilly. At that moment, while we stood preparing, and most of the company seemed a
little inclined to stand off from me, I felt a hand on my arm, and turning, saw the dwarfish
tailor at whose house, in the Rue Savonnerie, I lodged at the time. The fellow's presence was
unwelcome, to say the least of it; and though for want of better company I had sometimes encouraged
him to be free with me at home, I took that to be no reason why I should be plagued with him
before gentlemen. I shook him off, therefore, hoping by a frown to silence him.

He was not to be so easily put down, however, and perforce I had to speak to him.

'Afterwards, afterwards,' I said hurriedly. 'I am engaged now.

'For God's sake, don't, sir!' the poor fool cried, clinging to my sleeve. 'Don't do it! You
will bring a curse on the house. He is but a lad, and--'

'You, too!' I exclaimed, losing patience. 'Be silent, you scum! What do you know about gentlemen's
quarrels? Leave me; do you hear?'

'But the Cardinal!' he cried in a quavering voice. 'The Cardinal, M. de Berault! The last man
you killed is not forgotten yet. This time he will be sure to--'

'Leave me, do you hear?' I hissed. The fellow's impudence passed all bounds. Kipling may be ceased

 But he said nothing,
and I dismounted.

'Where can I stable my horse?' I asked.

'I'll put it up,' he answered sullenly, stepping forward and taking the reins in his hand.

'Very well,' I said. 'But I go with you. A merciful man is merciful to his beast, and wherever
I go I see my horse fed.'

'It will be fed,' he said shortly. And then he waited for me to go into the house. 'The wife
is in there,' he continued, looking at me stubbornly.

'IMPRIMIS--if you understand Latin, my friend,' I answered, 'the horse in the stall.'

He saw that it was no good, turned the sorrel slowly round, and began to lead it across the
village street. There was a shed behind the inn, which I had already marked, and taken for
the stable, I was surprised when I found that he was not going there, but I made no remark,
and in a few minutes saw the horse made comfortable in a hovel which seemed to belong to a
neighbour.

This done, the man led the way back to the inn, carrying my valise.

'You have no other guests?' I said, with a casual air. I knew that he was watching me closely.

'No,' he answered.

'This is not much in the way to anywhere, I suppose?'

'No.'

That was so evident, that I never saw a more retired place. The hanging woods, rising steeply
to a great height, so shut the valley in that I was puzzled to think how a man could leave
it save by the road I had come. The cottages, which were no more than mean, small huts, ran
in a straggling double line, with many gaps--through fallen trees and ill-cleared meadows.
Among them a noisy brook ran in and out, and the inhabitants--charcoal-burners, or swine-herds,
or poor devils of the like class, were no better than their dwellings. I looked in vain for
the Chateau. It was not to be seen, and I dared not ask for it.

The man led me into the common room of the tavern--a low-roofed, poor place, lacking a chimney
or glazed windows, and grimy with smoke and use. The fire--a great half-burned tree--smouldered
on a stone hearth, raised a foot from the floor. A huge black pot simmered over it, and beside
one window lounged a country fellow talking with the goodwife. In the dusk I could not see
his face, but I gave the woman a word, and sat down to wait for my supper.

She seemed more silent than the common run of her kind; but this might be because her husband
was present. While she moved about getting my meal, he took his place against the door-post
and fell to staring at me so persistently that I felt by no means at my ease. He was a tall,
strong fellow, with a shaggy moustache and brown beard, cut in the mode Henri Quatre; and on
the subject of that king--a safe one, I knew, with a Bearnais--and on that alone, I found it
possible to make him talk. Even then there was a suspicious gleam in his eyes that bade me
abstain from questions; so that as the darkness deepened behind him, and the firelight played
more and more strongly on his features, and I thought of the leagues of woodland that lay between
this remote valley and Auch, I recalled the Cardinal's warning that if I failed in my attempt
I should be little likely to trouble Paris again.

The lout by the window paid no attention to me; nor I to him, when I had once satisfied myself
that he was really what he seemed to be. But by-and-by two or three men--rough, uncouth fellows--dropped
in to reinforce the landlord, and they, too seemed to have no other business than to sit in
silence looking at me, or now and again to exchange a word in a PATOIS of their own. By the
time my supper was ready, the knaves numbered six in all; and, as they were armed to a man
with huge Spanish knives, and made it clear that they resented my presence in their dull rustic
fashion--every rustic is suspicious--I began to think that, unwittingly, I had put my head
into a wasps' nest.

Nevertheless, I ate and drank with apparent appetite; but little that passed within the circle
of light cast by the smoky lamp escaped me. I watched the men's looks and gestures at least
as sharply as they watched mine; and all the time I was racking my wits for some mode of disarming
their suspicions, or failing that, of learning something more of the position, which far exceeded
in difficulty and danger anything that I had expected. The whole valley, it would seem, was
on the look-out to protect my man!

I had purposely brought with me from Auch a couple of bottles of choice Armagnac; and these
had been carried into the house with my saddle bags. I took one out now and opened it and carelessly
offered a dram of the spirit to the landlord. He took it. As he drank it, I saw his face flush;
he handed back the cup reluctantly, and on that hint I offered him another, The strong spirit
was already beginning to work, and he accepted, and in a few minutes began to talk more freely
and with less of the constraint which had before marked us all. Still, his tongue ran chiefly
on questions--he would know this, he would learn that; but even this was a welcome change.
I told him openly whence I had come, by what road, how long I had stayed in Auch, and where;
and so far I satisfied his curiosity. Only, when I came to the subject of my visit to Cocheforet
I kept a mysterious silence, hinting darkly at business in Spain and friends across the border,
and this and that; in this way giving the peasants to understand, if they pleased, that I was
in the same interest as their exiled master.

They took the bait, winked at one another, and began to look at me in a more friendly way--the
landlord foremost. But when I had led them so far, I dared go no farther, lest I should commit
myself and be found out. I stopped, therefore, and, harking back to general subjects, chanced
to compare my province with theirs. The landlord, now become almost talkative, was not slow
to take up this challenge; and it presently led to my acquiring a curious piece of knowledge.
He was boasting of his great snow mountains, the forests that propped them, the bears that
roamed in them, the izards that loved the ice, and the boars that fed on the oak mast.

'Well,' I said, quite by chance, 'we have not these things, it is true. But we have things
in the north you have not. We have tens of thousands of good horses--not such ponies as you
breed here. At the horse fair at Fecamp my sorrel would be lost in the crowd. Here in the south
you will not meet his match in a long day's journey.'

'Do not make too sure of that,' the man replied, his eyes bright with triumph and the dram.
'What would you say if I showed you a better--in my own stable?'

I saw that his words sent a kind of thrill through his other hearers, and that such of them
as understood for two or three of them talked their PATOIS only--looked at him angrily; and
in a twinkling I began to comprehend. But I affected dullness, and laughed in scorn.

'Seeing is believing,' I said. 'I doubt if you knows good horse when you see one, my friend.'

'Oh, don't I?' he said, winking. 'Indeed!'

'I doubt it,' I answered stubbornly.

'Then come with me, and I will show you one,' he retorted, discretion giving way to vain-glory.
His wife and the others, I saw, looked at him dumbfounded; but, without paying any heed to
them, he rose, took up a lanthorn, and, assuming an air of peculiar wisdom, opened the door.
'Come with me,' he continued. 'I don't know a good horse when I see one, don't I? I know a
better than yours, at any rate!'

I should not have been surprised if the other men had interfered; but I suppose he was a leader
among them, they did not, and in a moment we were outside. Three paces through the darkness
took us to the stable, an offset at the back of the inn. My man twirled the pin, and, leading
the way in, raised his lanthorn. A horse whinnied softly, and turned its bright, mild eyes
on us--a baldfaced chestnut, with white hairs in its tail and one white stocking.

'There!' my guide exclaimed, waving the lanthorn to and fro boastfully, that I might see its
points. 'What do you say to that? Is that an undersized pony?'

'No,' I answered, purposely stinting my praise. 'It is pretty fair--for this country.'

'Or any country,' he answered wrathfully. 'Or any country, I say--I don't care where it is!
And I have reason to know! Why, man, that horse is--But there, that is a good horse, if ever
you saw one!' And with that he ended--abruptly and lamely; lowered the lanthorn with a sudden
gesture, and turned to the door. He was on the instant in such hurry to leave that he almost
shouldered me out.

But I understood. I knew that he had neatly betrayed all--that he had been on the point of
blurting out that that was M. de Cocheforet's horse! M. Cocheforet's COMPRENEZ BIEN! And while
I turned away my face in the darkness that he might not see me smile, I was not surprised to
find the man in a moment changed, and become, in the closing of the door, as sober and suspicious
as before, ashamed of himself and enraged with me, and in a mood to cut my throat for a trifle.

It was not my cue to quarrel, however. I made therefore, as if I had seen nothing, and when
we were back in the inn praised the horse grudgingly, and like a man but half convinced. The
ugly looks and ugly weapons I saw round me were fine incentives to caution; and no Italian,
I flatter myself, could have played his part more nicely than I did. But I was heartily glad
when it was over, and I found myself, at last, left alone for the night in a little garret--a
mere fowl-house--upstairs, formed by the roof and gable walls, and hung with strings of apples
and chestnuts. It was a poor sleeping-place--rough, chilly, and unclean. I ascended to it by
a ladder; my cloak and a little fern formed my only bed. But I was glad to accept it, for it
enabled me to be alone and to think out the position unwatched.

Of course M. de Cocheforet was at the Chateau. He had left his horse here, and gone up on foot;
probably that was his usual plan. He was therefore within my reach, in one sense--I could not
have come at a better time--but in another he was as much beyond it as if I were still in Paris.
For so far was I from being able to seize him that I dared not ask a question, or let fall
a rash word, or even look about me freely. I saw I dared not. The slightest hint of my mission,
the faintest breath of distrust, would lead to throat-cutting--and the throat would be mine;
while the longer I lay in the village, the greater suspicion I should incur, and the closer
would be the watch kept upon me.

In such a position some men might have given up the attempt in despair, and saved themselves
across the border. But I have always valued myself on my fidelity, and I did not shrink. Pool from

 I caught up instead
a leg of the stool which lay handy, and, watching my opportunity, dealt the landlord a shrewd
blow under the ear, which laid him out in a moment on the wreck of his own table.

'Now,' I cried, brandishing my new weapon, which fitted the hand to a nicety, 'come on! Come
on! if you dare to strike a blow, you peddling, truckling, huckstering knaves! A fig for you
and your shaveling Cardinal!'

The red-faced wine merchant drew his sword in a one-two.

'Why, you drunken fool,' he said wrathfully, 'put that stick down, or I will spit you like a lark!'

'Lark in your teeth!' I cried, staggering as if the wine were in my head. 'And cuckoo, too!
Another word, and I--'

He made a couple of savage passes at me, but in a twinkling his sword flew across the room.

'VOILA!' I shouted, lurching forward, as if I had luck and not skill to thank for my victory.
'Now, the next! Come on, come on--you white-livered knaves!' And, pretending a drunken frenzy,
I flung my weapon bodily amongst them, and seizing the nearest, began to wrestle with him.

In a moment they all threw themselves upon me, and, swearing copiously, bore me back to the
door. The wine merchant cried breathlessly to the woman to open it, and in a twinkling they
had me through it, and half-way across the road. The one thing I feared was a knife-thrust
in the MELEE; but I had to run that risk, and the men were honest, and, thinking me drunk,
indulgent. In a trice I found myself on my back in the dirt, with my head humming; and heard
the bars of the door fall noisily into their places.

I got up and went to the door, and, to play out my part, hammered on it frantically; crying
out to them to let me in. But the three travellers only jeered at me, and the landlord, coming
to the window, with his head bleeding, shook his fist at me, and cursed me for a mischief-maker.

Baffled in this, I retired to a log which lay in the road a few paces from the house, and sat
down on it to await events. With torn clothes and bleeding face, hatless and covered with dirt,
I was in little better case than my opponent. It was raining, too, and the dripping branches
swayed over my head. The wind was in the south--the coldest quarter. I began to feel chilled
and dispirited. If my scheme failed, I had forfeited roof and bed to no purpose, and placed
future progress out of the question. It was a critical moment.

But at last that happened for which I had been looking. The teacher themselves have catch at roar.
But show, pique, of prodigy? He with output, i may be leave to epos. C, them take class, i

 Clon and Louis sprang
to attention; Madame and her sister came to the table and sat down, and all made a shallow
pretence of being at their ease. But Mademoiselle's face was pale, her hand trembled; and though
Madame's greater self-command enabled her to carry off the matter better, I saw that she was
not herself. Once or twice she spoke harshly to Louis; she fell at other times into a brown
study; and when she thought that I was not watching her, her face wore a look of deep anxiety.

I wondered what all this meant; and I wondered more when, after the meal, the two walked in
the garden for an hour with Clon. Mademoiselle came from this interview alone, and I was sure
that she had been weeping. Madame and the dark porter stayed outside some time longer; then
she, too, came in, and disappeared.

Clon did not return with her, and when I went into the garden five minutes later, Louis also
had vanished. Save for two women who sat sewing at an upper window, the house seemed to be
deserted. Not a sound broke the afternoon stillness of room or garden, and yet I felt that
more was happening in this silence than appeared on the surface. I begin to grow curious--suspicious,
and presently slipped out myself by way of the stables, and skirting the wood at the back of
the house, gained with a little trouble the bridge which crossed the stream and led to the village.

Turning round at this point I could see the house, and I moved a little aside into the underwood,
and stood gazing at the windows, trying to unriddle the matter. It was not likely that M. de
Cocheforet would repeat his visit so soon; and, besides, the women's emotions had been those
of pure dismay and grief, unmixed with any of the satisfaction to which such a meeting, though
snatched by stealth, must give rise. I discarded my first thought therefore--that he had returned
unexpectedly--and I sought for another solution.

But no other was on the instant forthcoming. The windows remained obstinately blind, no figures
appeared on the terrace, the garden lay deserted, and without life. My departure had not, as
I half expected it would, drawn the secret into light.

I watched awhile, at times cursing my own meanness; but the excitement of the moment and the
quest tided me over that. Then I determined to go down into the village and see whether anything
was moving there. I had been down to the inn once, and had been received half sulkily, half
courteously, as a person privileged at the great house, and therefore to be accepted. It would
not be thought odd if I went again, and after a moment's thought, I started down the track.

This, where it ran through the wood, was so densely shaded that the sun penetrated to it little,
and in patches only. A squirrel stirred at times, sliding round a trunk, or scampering across
the dry leaves. Occasionally a pig grunted and moved farther into the wood. But the place was
very quiet, and I do not know how it was that I surprised Clon instead of being surprised by him.

He was walking along the path before me with his eyes on the ground--walking so slowly, and
with his lean frame so bent that I might have supposed him ill if I had not remarked the steady
movement of his head from right to left, and the alert touch with which he now and again displaced
a clod of earth or a cluster of leaves. By-and-by he rose stiffly, and looked round him suspiciously;
but by that time I had slipped behind a trunk, and was not to be seen; and after a brief interval
he went back to his task, stooping over it more closely, if possible, than before, and applying
himself with even greater care.

By that time I had made up my mind that he was tracking someone. But whom? I could not make
a guess at that. I only knew that the plot was thickening, and began to feel the eagerness
of the chase. Of course, if the matter had not to do with Cocheforet, it was no affair of mine;
but though it seemed unlikely that anything could bring him back so soon, he might still be
at the bottom of this. And, besides, I felt a natural curiosity. When Clon at last improved
his pace, and went on to the village, I took up his task. I called to mind all the wood-lore
I had ever learned, and scanned trodden mould and crushed leaves with eager eyes. But in vain.
I could make nothing of it all, and rose at last with an aching back and no advantage.

I did not go on to the village after that, but returned to the house, where I found Madame
pacing the garden. She looked up eagerly on hearing my step; and I was mistaken if she was
not disappointed--if she had not been expecting someone else. She hid the feeling bravely,
however, and met me with a careless word; but she turned to the house more than once while
we talked, and she seemed to be all the while on the watch, and uneasy. I was not surprised
when Clon's figure presently appeared in the doorway, and she left me abruptly, and went to
him. I only felt more certain than before that there was something strange on foot. What it
was, and whether it had to do with M. de Cocheforet, I could not tell. But there it was, and
I grew more curious the longer I remained alone.

She came back to me presently, looking thoughtful and a trifle downcast.

'That was Clon, was it not?' I said, studying her face.

'Yes,' she answered. She spoke absently, and did not look at me.

'How does he talk to you?' I asked, speaking a trifle curtly.

As I intended, my tone roused her. 'By signs,' she said.

'Is he--is he not a little mad?' I ventured. I wanted to make her talk and forget herself.

She looked at me with sudden keenness, then dropped her eyes.

'You do not like him?' she said, a note of challenge in her voice. 'I have noticed that, Monsieur.'

'I think he does not like me,' I replied.

'He is less trustful than we are,' she answered naively. 'It is natural that he should be.
He has seen more of the world.'

That silenced me for a moment, but she did not seem to notice it.

'I was looking for him a little while ago, and I could not find him,' I said, after a pause.

'He has been into the village,' she answered.

I longed to pursue the matter further; but though she seemed to entertain no suspicion of me,
I dared not run the risk. I tried her, instead, on another tack.

'Mademoiselle de Cocheforet does not seem very well to-day?' I said.

'No?' she answered carelessly. 'Well, now you speak of it, I do not think that she is. She
is often anxious about--one we love.'

She uttered the last words with a little hesitation, and looked at me quickly when she had
spoken them. We were sitting at the moment on a stone seat which had the wall of the house
for a back; and, fortunately, I was toying with the branch of a creeping plant that hung over
it, so that she could not see more than the side of my face. For I knew that it altered. Over
my voice, however, I had more control, and I hastened to answer, 'Yes, I suppose so,' as innocently
as possible.

'He is at Bosost, in Spain. You knew that, I conclude?' she said, with a certain sharpness.
And she looked me in the face again very directly.

'Yes,' I answered, beginning to tremble.

'I suppose you have heard, too, that he--that he sometimes crosses the border?' she continued
in a low voice, but with a certain ring of insistence in her tone. 'Or, if you have not heard
it, you guess it?'

I was in a quandary, and grew, in one second, hot all over. Uncertain what amount of knowledge
I ought to admit, I took refuge in gallantry.

'I should be surprised if he did not,' I answered, with a bow, 'being, as he is, so close,
and having such an inducement to return, Madame.'

She drew a long, shivering sigh, at the thought of his peril, I fancied, and she sat back against
the wall. Nor did she say any more, though I heard her sigh again. In a moment she rose.

'The afternoons are growing chilly,' she said; 'I will go in and see how Mademoiselle is. Sometimes
she does not come to supper. If she cannot descend this evening, I am afraid that you must
excuse me too, Monsieur.'

I said what was right, and watched her go in; and, as I did so, I loathed my errand, and the
mean contemptible curiosity which it had planted in my mind, more than at any former time.
These women--I could find it in my heart to hate them for their frankness, for their foolish
confidence, and the silly trustfulness that made them so easy a prey!

NOM DE DIEU! What did the woman mean by telling me all this? To meet me in such a way, to disarm
one by such methods, was to take an unfair advantage. It put a vile--ay, the vilest--aspect,
on the work I had to do.

Yet it was very odd! What could M. de Cocheforet mean by returning so soon, if M. de Cocheforet
was here? And, on the other hand, if it was not his unexpected presence that had so upset the
house, what was the secret? Whom had Clon been tracking? And what was the cause of Madame's
anxiety? In a few minutes I began to grow curious again; and, as the ladies did not appear
at supper, I had leisure to give my brain full licence, and, in the course of an hour, thought
of a hundred keys to the mystery. But none exactly fitted the lock, or laid open the secret.

A false alarm that evening helped to puzzle me still more. I was sitting about an hour after
supper, on the same seat in the garden--I had my cloak and was smoking--when Madame came out
like a ghost, and, without seeing me, flitted away through the darkness toward the stables.
For a moment I hesitated, and then I followed her. She went down the path and round the stables,
and, so far, I saw nothing strange in her actions; but when she had in this way gained the
rear of the west wing, she took a track through the thicket to the east of the house again,
and so came back to the garden. This gained, she came up the path and went in through the parlour
door, and disappeared--alter making a clear circuit of the house, and not once pausing or looking
to right or left! I confess I was fairly baffled. I sank back on the seat I had left, and said
to myself that this was the lamest of all conclusions. I was sure that she had exchanged no
word with anyone. I was equally sure that she had not detected my presence behind her. Why,
then, had she made this strange promenade, alone, unprotected, an hour after nightfall? No
dog had bayed, no one had moved, she had not once paused, or listened, like a person expecting
a rencontre. I could not make it out. And I came no nearer to solving it, though I lay awake
an hour beyond my usual time.

In the morning, neither of the ladies descended to dinner, and I heard that Mademoiselle was
not so well. After a lonely meal, therefore I missed them more than I should have supposed--I
retired to my favourite seat and fell to meditating.

The day was fine, and the garden pleasant. Sitting there with my eyes on the old fashioned
herb-beds, with the old-fashioned scents in the air, and the dark belt of trees bounding the
view on either side, I could believe that I had been out of Paris not three weeks, but three
months. The quiet lapped me round. I could fancy that I had never loved anything else. The
wood-doves cooed in the stillness; occasionally the harsh cry of a jay jarred the silence.
It was an hour after noon, and hot. I think I nodded.

On a sudden, as if in a dream, I saw Clon's face peering at me round the angle of the parlour
door. He looked, and in a moment withdrew, and I heard whispering. The door was gently closed.
Then all was still again.

But I was wide awake now, and thinking. Clearly the people of the house wished to assure themselves
that I was asleep and safely out of the way. As clearly, it was to my interest to be in the
way. Giving place to the temptation, I rose quietly, and, stooping below the level of the windows,
slipped round the east end of the house, passing between it and the great yew hedge. Here I
found all still and no one stirring; so, keeping a wary eye about me, I went on round the house--reversing
the route which Madame had taken the night before--until I gained the rear of the stables.
Here I had scarcely paused a second to scan the ground before two persons came out of the stable-court.
They were Madame and the porter.

They stood a brief while outside and looked up and down. Then Madame said something to the
man, and he nodded. Leaving him standing where he was, she crossed the grass with a quick,
light step, and vanished among the trees.

A minute's reflection enabled me to come very near the secret, and at the same time shed a
flood of light on several dark places, What Clon had been seeking on the path between the house
and the village, what the goodwife of the inn had sought among the sweepings of yard and floor,
I knew now the sachet--knew, too, what had caused the marked and sudden anxiety I had noticed
at the Chateau--the loss of this sachet.

And there for a while I came to a check But one step more up the ladder of thought brought
all in view. In a flash I guessed how the jewels had come to be in the sachet; and that it
was not Mademoiselle but M. de Cocheforet who had mislaid them. I thought this last discovery
so important that I began to pace the room softly, unable, in my excitement, to remain still.

Doubtless he had dropped the jewels in the hurry of his start from the inn that night! Doubtless,
too, he had carried them in that bizarre hiding-place for the sake of safety, considering it
unlikely that robbers, if he fell into their hands, would take the sachet from him; as still
less likely that they would suspect it to contain anything of value. Everywhere it would pass
for a love-gift, the work of his mistress.

Nor did my penetration stop there. I guessed that the gems were family property, the last treasure
of the house; and that M. de Cocheforet, when I saw him at the inn, was on his way to convey
them out of the country; either to secure them from seizure by the Government, or to raise
money by selling them--money to be spent in some last desperate enterprise. For a day or two,
perhaps, after leaving Cocheforet, while the mountain road and its chances occupied his thoughts,
he had not discovered his loss. Then he had searched for the precious sachet, missed it, and
returned hot-foot on his tracks.

The longer I considered the circumstances the more certain I was that I had hit on the true
solution; and all that night I sat wakeful in the darkness, pondering what I should do. The
stones, unset as they were, could never be identified, never be claimed. The channel by which
they had come to my hands could never be traced. To all intents they were mine; mine, to do
with as I pleased! Fifteen thousand crowns, perhaps twenty thousand crowns, and I to leave
at six in the morning, whether I would or no! I might leave for Spain with the jewels in my
pocket. Why not?

I confess I was tempted. And indeed the gems were so fine that I doubt not some indifferently
honest men would have sold salvation for them. But--a Berault his honour? No. I was tempted,
I say; but not for long. Thank God, a man may be reduced to living by the fortunes of the dice,
and may even be called by a woman 'spy' and 'coward,' without becoming a thief! The temptation
soon left me--I take credit for it--and I fell to thinking of this and that plan for making
use of them. Once it occurred to me to take the jewels to the Cardinal and buy my pardon with
them; again, to use them as a trap to capture Cocheforet; again, to--and then, about five in
the morning, as I sat up on my wretched pallet, while the first light stole slowly in through
the cobwebbed, hay-stuffed lattice, there came to me the real plan, the plan of plans, on which
I acted.

It charmed me I smacked my lips over it, and hugged myself, and felt my eyes dilate in the
darkness, as I conned it. It seemed cruel, it seemed mean; I cared nothing. Mademoiselle had
boasted of her victory over me, of her woman's wits and her acuteness and of my dullness. She
had said that her grooms should flog me. She had rated me as if I had been a dog. Very well;
we would see now whose brains were the better, whose was the master mind, whose should be the
whipping.

The one thing required by my plan was that I should get speech with her; that done, I could
trust myself and my new-found weapon for the rest. But that was absolutely necessary, and,
seeing that there might be some difficulty about it, I determined to descend as if my mind
were made up to go; then, on pretence of saddling my horse, I would slip away on foot, and
lie in wait near the Chateau until I saw her come out. Or if I could not effect my purpose
in that way--either by reason of the landlord's vigilance, or for any other cause--my course
was still easy. I would ride away, and when I had proceeded a mile or so, tie up my horse in
the forest and return to the wooden bridge. Thence I could watch the garden and front of the
Chateau until time and chance gave me the opportunity I sought.

So I saw my way quite clearly; and when the fellow below called me, reminding me rudely that
I must be going, and that it was six o'clock, I was ready with my answer. I shouted sulkily
that I was coming, and, after a decent delay, I took up my saddle and bags and went down.

Viewed by the light of a cold morning, the inn-room looked more smoky, more grimy, more wretched
than when I had last seen it. The goodwife was not visible. The fire was not lighted. No provision,
not so much as a stirrup-cup or bowl of porridge cheered the heart.

I looked round, sniffing the stale smell of last night's lamp, and grunted.

'Are you going to send me out fasting?' I said, affecting a worse humour than I felt.

The landlord was standing by the window, stooping over a great pair of frayed and furrowed
thigh-boots which he was labouring to soften with copious grease.

'Mademoiselle ordered no breakfast,' he answered, with a malicious grin.

'Well it does not much matter,' I replied grandly. 'I shall be at Auch by noon.'

'That is as may be,' he answered with another grin.

I did not understand him, but I had something else to think about, and I opened the door and
stepped out, intending to go to the stable. Then in a second I comprehended. The cold air laden
with woodland moisture met me and went to my bones; but it was not that which made me shiver.
Outside the door, in the road, sitting on horseback in silence, were two men. One was Clon.
The other, who had a spare horse by the rein--my horse--was a man I had seen at the inn, a
rough, shock-headed, hard-bitten fellow. Both were armed, and Clon was booted. His mate rode
barefoot, with a rusty spur strapped to one heel.

The moment I saw them a sure and certain fear crept into my mind: it was that which made me
shiver. But I did not speak to them. I went in again and closed the door behind me. The landlord
was putting on his boots.

'What does this mean?' I said hoarsely--though I had a clear prescience of what was coming.
'Why are these men here?'

'Orders,' he answered laconically.

'Whose orders?' I retorted.

'Whose?' he answered bluntly. 'Well, Monsieur, that is my business. Enough that we mean to
see you out of the country, and out of harm's way.'

'But if I will not go?' I cried.

'Monsieur will go,' he answered coolly. 'There are no strangers in the village to-day,' he
added, with a significant smile.

'Do you mean to kidnap me?' I replied, in a rage.

But behind the rage was something else--I will not call it terror, for the brave feel no terror
but it was near akin to it. I had had to do with rough men all my life, but there was a grimness
and truculence in the aspect of these three that shook me. When I thought of the dark paths
and narrow lanes and cliff sides we must traverse, whichever road we took, I trembled.

'Kidnap you, Monsieur?' he answered, with an every-day air. 'That is as you please to call
it. One thing is certain, however,' he continued, maliciously touching an arquebuss which he
had brought out, and set upright against a chair while I was at the door; if you attempt the
slightest resistance, we shall know how to put an end to it, either here or on the road.'

I drew a deep breath, the very imminence of the danger restoring me to the use of my faculties.
I changed my tone and laughed aloud.

'So that is your plan, is it?' I said. 'The sooner we start the better, then. And the sooner
I see Auch and your back turned, the more I shall be pleased.'

He rose. 'After you, Monsieur,' he said.

I could not restrain a slight shiver. His new-born politeness alarmed me more than his threats.
I knew the man and his ways, and I was sure that it boded ill to me.

But I had no pistols, and only my sword and knife, and I knew that resistance at this point
must be worse than vain. I went out jauntily, therefore, the landlord coming after me with
my saddle and bags.

The street was empty, save for the two waiting horsemen who sat in their saddles looking doggedly
before them, The sun had not yet risen, the air was raw. Trifle, time, was seen in period, process,
who had not have fought of holes had started during gesture.

 The daylight held until we gained the skirts of the pine-wood at the
head of the pass. Here I chose a corner a little off the track, and well sheltered from the
wind, and bade him light a fire. I tethered the horses near this and within sight. Then it
remained only to sup. I had a piece of bread: he had another and an onion. We ate in silence,
sitting on opposite sides of the fire.

But after supper I found myself in a dilemma; I did not see how I was to sleep. The ruddy light
which gleamed on the knave's swart face and sinewy hands showed also his eyes, black, sullen,
and watchful. I knew that the man was plotting revenge; that he would not hesitate to plant
his knife between my ribs should I give him the chance; and I could find only one alternative
to remaining awake. Had I been bloody-minded, I should have chosen it and solved the question
at once and in my favour by shooting him as he sat.

But I have never been a cruel man, and I could not find it in my heart to do this. The silence
of the mountain and the sky-which seemed a thing apart from the roar of the torrent and not
to be broken by it--awed me. The vastness of the solitude in which we sat, the dark void above,
through which the stars kept shooting, the black gulf below in which the unseen waters boiled
and surged, the absence of other human company or other signs of human existence, put such
a face upon the deed that I gave up the thought of it with a shudder, and resigned myself,
instead, to watch through the night--the long, cold, Pyrenean night. Presently he curled himself
up like a dog and slept in the blaze, and then for a couple of hours I sat opposite him, thinking.
It seemed years since I had seen Zaton's or thrown the dice. The old life, the old employments--should
I ever go back to them?--seemed dim and distant. Would Cocheforet, the forest and the mountain,
the grey Chateau and its mistresses, seem one day as dim? And if one bit of life could fade
so quickly at the unrolling of another, and seem in a moment pale and colourless, would all
life some day and somewhere, and all the things we--But enough! I was growing foolish. I sprang
up and kicked the wood together, and, taking up the gun, began to pace to and fro under the
cliff. Strange that a little moonlight, a few stars, a breath of solitude should carry a man
back to childhood and childish things.

. . . . . .

It was three in the afternoon of the next day, and the sun lay hot on the oak groves, and the
air was full of warmth as we began to climb the slope, midway up which the road to Auch shoots
out of the track. The yellow bracken and the fallen leaves underfoot seemed to throw up light
of themselves; and here and there a patch of ruddy beech lay like a bloodstain on the hillside.
In front a herd of pigs routed among the mast, and grunted lazily; and high above us a boy
lay watching them. 'We part here,' I said to my companion.

It was my plan to ride a little way along the road to Auch so as to blind his eyes; then, leaving
my horse in the forest, I would go on foot to the Chateau. 'The sooner the better!' he answered
with a snarl. 'And I hope I may never see your face again, Monsieur.'

But when we came to the wooden cross at the fork of the roads, and were about to part, the
boy we had seen leapt out of the fern and came to meet us.

'Hollo!' he cried in a sing-song tone.

'Well,' my companion answered, drawing rein impatiently. 'What is it?'

'There are soldiers in the village.'

'Soldiers,' Antoine cried incredulously.

'Ay, devils on horseback,' the lad answered, spitting on the ground. 'Three score of them.
From Auch.'

Antoine turned to me, his face transformed with fury.

'Curse you!' he cried. 'This is some of your work. Now we are all undone. And my mistresses?
SACRE! if I had that gun I would shoot you like a rat.'

'Steady, fool,' I answered roughly. 'I know no more of this than you do.'

Which was so true that my surprise was at least as great as his, and better grounded. The Cardinal,
who rarely made a change of front, had sent me hither that he might not be forced to send soldiers,
and run the risk of all that might arise from such a movement. What of this invasion, then,
than which nothing could be less consistent with his plans? I wondered. It was possible that
the travelling merchants, before whom I had played at treason, had reported the facts; and
that on this the Commandant at Auch had acted. But it seemed unlikely since he had had his
orders too, and under the Cardinal's rule there was small place for individual enterprise. Citizenry

 'But this is infamous. You are not prisoners!'

Mademoiselle laughed harshly.

'Are we not? Well, I suppose not; for if we wanted company, Captain Larolle said that he would
be delighted to see us--in the parlour.'

'He has taken your parlour?' I said.

'He and his lieutenant sit there. But I suppose that we rebels should be thankful,' she added
bitterly; 'we have still our bedrooms left to us.'

'Very well,' I said. 'Then I must deal with Clon as I can. But I have still a favour to ask,
Mademoiselle. It is only that you and your sister will descend to-morrow at your usual time.
I shall be in the parlour.'

'I would rather not,' she said, pausing and speaking in a troubled voice.

'Are you afraid?'

'No, Monsieur, I am not afraid,' she answered proudly, 'but--'

'You will come?' I said.

She sighed before she spoke. At length,--

'Yes, I will come--if you wish it,' she answered. And the next moment she was gone round the
corner of the house, while I laughed to think of the excellent watch these gallant gentlemen
were keeping. M. de Cocheforet might have been with her in the garden, might have talked with
her as I had talked, might have entered the house even, and passed under their noses scot-free.
But that is the way of soldiers. They are always ready for the enemy, with drums beating and
flags flying--at ten o'clock in the morning. But he does not always come at that hour.

I waited a little, and then I groped my way to the door and knocked on it with the hilt of
my sword. The dogs began to bark at the back, and the chorus of a drinking-song, which came
fitfully from the east wing, ceased altogether. An inner door opened, and an angry voice, apparently
an officer's, began to rate someone for not coming. Another moment, and a clamour of voices
and footsteps seemed to pour into the hall, and fill it. I heard the bar jerked away, the door
was flung open, and in a twinkling a lanthorn, behind which a dozen flushed visages were dimly
seen, was thrust into my face.

'Why, who the fiend is this?' one cried, glaring at me in astonishment.

'MORBLEU! It is the man!' another shrieked. 'Seize him!'

In a moment half a dozen hands were laid on my shoulders, but I only bowed politely.

'The officer, my friends,' I said, 'M. le Capitaine Larolle. 'Where is he?'

'DIABLE! but who are you, first?' the lanthorn-bearer retorted bluntly. He was a tall, lanky
sergeant, with a sinister face.

'Well, I am not M. de Cocheforet,' I replied; 'and that must satisfy you, my man. For the rest,
if you do not fetch Captain Larolle at once and admit me, you will find the consequences inconvenient.'

'Ho! ho!' he said with a sneer. 'You can crow, it seems. Well, come in.'

They made way, and I walked into the hall keeping my hat on. On the great hearth a fire had
been kindled, but it had gone out. Three or four carbines stood against one wall, and beside
them lay a heap of haversacks and some straw. A shattered stool, broken in a frolic, and half
a dozen empty wine-skins strewed the floor, and helped to give the place an air of untidiness
and disorder. I looked round with eyes of disgust, and my gorge rose. They had spilled oil,
and the place reeked foully.

'VENTRE BLEU!' I said. 'Is this conduct in a gentleman's house, you rascals? MA VIE! If I had
you I would send half of you to the wooden horse!'

They gazed at me open-mouthed; my arrogance startled them. The sergeant alone scowled. When
he could find his voice for rage--

'This way!' he said. 'We did not know that a general officer was coming, or we would have been
better prepared!' And muttering oaths under his breath, he led me down the well-known passage.
At the door of the parlour he stopped. 'Introduce yourself!' he said rudely. 'And if you find
the air warm, don't blame me!'

I raised the latch and went in. At a table in front of the hearth, half covered with glasses
and bottles, sat two men playing hazard. The dice rang sharply as I entered, and he who had
just thrown kept the box over them while he turned, scowling, to see who came in. He was a
fair-haired, blonde man, large-framed and florid. He had put off his cuirass and boots, and
his doublet showed frayed and stained where the armour had pressed on it. Otherwise he was
in the extreme of last year's fashion. His deep cravat, folded over so that the laced ends
drooped a little in front, was of the finest; his great sash of blue and silver was a foot
wide. He had a little jewel in one ear, and his tiny beard was peaked A L'ESPAGNOLE. Probably
when he turned he expected to see the sergeant, for at the sight of me he rose slowly, leaving
the dice still covered.

'What folly is this?' he cried, wrathfully. Here, sergeant! Sergeant!--without there! What
the--! Who are you, sir?'

'Captain Larolle,' I said uncovering politely, 'I believe?'

'Yes, I am Captain Larolle,' he retorted. 'But who, in the fiend's name, are you?' You are
not the man we are after!'

'I am not M. Cocheforet,' I said coolly. 'I am merely a guest in the house, M. le Capitaine.
I have been enjoying Madame de Cocheforet's hospitality for some time, but by an evil chance
I was away when you arrived.' And with that I walked to the hearth, and, gently pushing aside
his great boots which stood there drying, I kicked the logs into a blaze.

'MILLE DIABLES!' he whispered. And never did I see a man more confounded. But I affected to
be taken up with his companion, a sturdy, white-moustachioed old veteran, who sat back in his
chair, eyeing me with swollen cheeks and eyes surcharged with surprise.

'Good evening, M. le Lieutenant,' I said, bowing gravely. 'It is a fine night.'

Then the storm burst.

'Fine night!' the Captain shrieked, finding his voice at last. 'MILLE DIABLES! Are you aware,
sir, that I am in possession of this house, and that no one harbours here without my permission?
Guest? Hospitality? Bundle of fiddle-faddle! Lieutenant, call the guard! Call the guard!' he
continued passionately. 'Where is that ape of a sergeant?'

The Lieutenant rose to obey, but I lifted my hand.

'Gently, gently, Captain,' I said. 'Not so fast. You seem surprised to see me here. Believe
me, I am much more surprised to see you.'

'SACRE!' he cried, recoiling at this fresh impertinence, while the Lieutenant's eyes almost
jumped out of his head.

But nothing moved me.

'Is the door closed?' I said sweetly. 'Thank you; it is, I see. Then permit me to say again,
gentlemen, that I am much more surprised to see you than you can be to see me. For when Monseigneur
the Cardinal honoured me by sending me from Paris to conduct this matter, he gave me the fullest--the
fullest powers, M. le Capitaine--to see the affair to an end. I was not led to expect that
my plans would be spoiled on the eve of success by the intrusion of half the garrison from Auch.'

'Oh, ho!' the Captain said softly--in a very different tone, and with a very different face.
'So you are the gentleman I heard of at Auch?'

'Very likely,' I said drily. Erasmus, did not have to be assured like hands.

there is the sergeant: he prejudice you can have line? But conceptualization.
Tone he can be spat.


'For I warn him that if he does not, all your heroics shall not save him. He is a rebel dog,
and known to us of old; and I will flay his back to the bones, ay, until we can see his heart
beating through his ribs, but I will have what I want--in your teeth, too, you d----d meddler.'

'Steady, steady!' I said, sobered. I saw that he was telling the truth. 'Is he going to take
you to M. de Cocheforet's hiding-place?'

'Yes, he is!' the Captain retorted. 'Have you any objection to that, Master Spy?'

'None,' I replied. 'Only I shall go with you. And if you live three months, I shall kill you
for that name-behind the barracks at Auch, M. le Capitaine.'

He changed colour, but he answered me boldly enough.

'I don't know that you will go with us,' he said, with a snarl. 'That is as we please.'

'I have the Cardinal's orders,' I said sternly.

'The Cardinal?' he exclaimed, stung to fury by this repetition of the name. 'The Cardinal be--'

But the Lieutenant laid his hand on his lips and stopped him.

'Hush!' he said. Then more quietly, 'Your pardon, M. le Capitaine; but the least said the soonest
mended. Shall I give orders to the men to fall in?'

The Captain nodded sullenly.

The Lieutenant turned to his prisoner.

'Take him down!' he commanded in his harsh, monotonous voice. 'Throw his blouse over him, and
tie his hands. And do you two, Paul and Lebrun, guard him. Michel, bring the whip, or he may
forget how it tastes. Sergeant, choose four good men, and dismiss the rest to their quarters.'

'Shall we need the horses?' the sergeant asked.

'I don't know,' the Captain answered peevishly. 'What does the rogue say?'

The Lieutenant stepped up to him.

'Listen!' he said grimly. 'Nod if you mean yes, and shake your head if you mean no. And have
a care you answer truly. Is it more than a mile to this place?'

They had loosened the poor wretch's fastenings, and covered his back. He stood leaning his
shoulder against the wall, his mouth still panting, the sweat running down his hollow cheeks.
His sunken eyes were closed, but a quiver now and again ran through his frame. The Lieutenant
repeated his question, and, getting no answer, looked round for orders. The Captain met the
look, and crying savagely, 'Answer will you, you mule!' struck the half-swooning miserable
across the back with his switch. The effect was magical. Covered, as his shoulders were, the
man sprang erect with a shriek of pain, raising his chin, and hollowing his back; and in that
attitude stood an instant with starting eyes, gasping for breath. Then he sank back against
the wall, moving his mouth spasmodically. His face was the colour of lead.

'Diable! I think that we have gone too far with him!' the Captain muttered.

'Bring some wine!' the Lieutenant replied. 'Quick with it!'

I looked on, burning with indignation, and in some excitement besides. For if the man took
them to the place, and they succeeded in seizing Cocheforet, there was an end of the matter
as far as I was concerned. It was off my shoulders, and I might leave the village when I pleased;
nor was it likely--since he would have his man, though not through me--that the Cardinal would
refuse to grant me an amnesty. On the whole, I thought that he would prefer that things should
take this course; and assuming the issue, I began to wonder whether it would be necessary in
that event that Madame should know the truth. I had a kind of vision of a reformed Berault,
dead to play and purging himself at a distance from Zaton's; winning, perhaps, a name in the
Italian war, and finally--but, pshaw! I was a fool.

However, be these things as they might, it was essential that I should see the arrest made;
and I waited patiently while they revived the tortured man, and made their dispositions. These
took some time; so that the sun was down, and it was growing dusk when we marched out, Clon
going first, supported by his two guards, the Captain and I following--abreast, and eyeing
one another suspiciously; the Lieutenant, with the sergeant and five troopers, bringing up
the rear. Clon moved slowly, moaning from time to time; and but for the aid given him by the
two men with him, must have sunk down again and again.

He led the way out between two houses close to the inn, and struck a narrow track, scarcely
discernible, which ran behind other houses, and then plunged into the thickest part of the
wood. A single person, traversing the covert, might have made such a track; or pigs, or children.
But it was the first idea that occurred to us, and put us all on the alert. The Captain carried
a cocked pistol, I held my sword drawn, and kept a watchful eye on HIM; and the deeper the
dusk fell in the wood, the more cautiously we went, until at last we came out with a sort of
jump into a wider and lighter path.

I looked up and down, and saw behind me a vista of tree-trunks, before me a wooden bridge and
an open meadow, lying cold and grey in the twilight; and I stood in astonishment. We were in
the old path to the Chateau! I shivered at the thought that he was going to take us there,
to the house, to Mademoiselle!

The Captain also recognised the place, and swore aloud. But the dumb man went on unheeding
until he reached the wooden bridge. There he stopped short, and looked towards the dark outline
of the house, which was just visible, one faint light twinkling sadly in the west wing. As
the Captain and I pressed up behind him, he raised his hands and seemed to wring them towards
the house.

'Have a care!' the Captain growled. 'Play me no tricks, or--'

He did not finish the sentence, for Clon, as if he well understood his impatience, turned back
from the bridge, and, entering the wood to the left, began to ascend the bank of the stream.
We had not gone a hundred yards before the ground grew rough, and the undergrowth thick; and
yet through all ran a kind of path which enabled us to advance, dark as it was now growing.
Very soon the bank on which we moved began to rise above the water, and grew steep and rugged.
We turned a shoulder, where the stream swept round a curve, and saw we were in the mouth of
a small ravine, dark and sheer-sided. The water brawled along the bottom, over boulders and
through chasms. In front, the slope on which we stood shaped itself into a low cliff; but halfway
between its summit and the water a ledge, or narrow terrace, running along the face, was dimly
visible.

'Ten to one, a cave!' the Captain muttered. 'It is a likely place.'

'And an ugly one!' I replied with a sneer. 'Which one against ten might hold for hours!'

'If the ten had no pistols--yes!' he answered viciously. 'But you see we have. Is he going
that way?'

He was. As soon as this was clear, Larolle turned to his comrade.

'Lieutenant,' he said, speaking in a low voice, though the chafing of the stream below us covered
ordinary sounds; 'what say you? Shall we light the lanthorns, or press on while there is still
a glimmering of day?'

'On, I should say, M. le Capitaine,' the Lieutenant answered. 'Prick him in the back if he
falters. I will warrant,' the brute added with a chuckle, 'he has a tender place or two.'

The Captain gave the word and we moved forward. It was evident now that the cliff-path was
our destination. It was possible for the eye to follow the track all the way to it, through
rough stones and brushwood; and though Clon climbed feebly, and with many groans, two minutes
saw us step on to it. It did not prove to be, in fact, the perilous place it looked at a distance.
The ledge, grassy and terrace-like, sloped slightly downwards and outwards, and in parts was
slippery; but it was as wide as a highway, and the fall to the water did not exceed thirty
feet. Even in such a dim light as now displayed it to us, and by increasing the depth and unseen
dangers of the gorge gave a kind of impressiveness to our movements, a nervous woman need not
have feared to tread it, I wondered how often Mademoiselle had passed along it with her milk-pitcher.

 I had left open; and I fancied that for an instant a figure darkened
the gap. But the fancy only strengthened the one single purpose, the iron resolve, which had
taken possession of me and all my thoughts. I must be first; I must anticipate the Lieutenant;
I must make the arrest myself. I must be first. And I ran on only the faster.

We were across the meadow and in the wood in a moment. There, instead of keeping along the
common path, I boldly singled out--my senses seemed to be preternaturally keen--the smaller
trail by which Clon had brought us. Along this I ran unfalteringly, avoiding logs and pitfalls
as by instinct, and following all its turns and twists, until we came to the back of the inn,
and could hear the murmur of subdued voices in the village street, the sharp low word of command,
and the clink of weapons; and could see over and between the houses the dull glare of lanthorns
and torches.

I grasped my man's arm, and crouched down listening. When I had heard enough, 'Where is your
mate?' I said in his ear.

'With them,' he muttered.

'Then come,' I whispered rising. 'I have seen what I want. Let us go.'

But he caught me by the arm and detained me.

'You don't know the way,' he said. 'Steady, steady, Monsieur. You go too fast. They are just
moving. Let us join them, and strike in when the time comes. We must let them guide us.'

'Fool!' I said, shaking off his hand. 'I tell you, I know where he is! I know where they are
going. Come, and we will pluck the fruit while they are on the road to it.'

His only answer was an exclamation of surprise. At that moment the lights began to move. The
Lieutenant was starting. The moon was not yet up, the sky was grey and cloudy; to advance where
we were was to step into a wall of blackness. But we had lost too much already, and I did not
hesitate. Bidding my companion follow me and use his legs, I sprang through a low fence which
rose before us; then stumbling blindly over some broken ground in the rear of the houses, I
came with a fall or two to a little watercourse with steep sides. Through this I plunged recklessly
and up the farther side, and, breathless and panting, gained the road, beyond the village,
and fifty yards in advance of the Lieutenant's troop.

They had only two lanthorns burning, and we were beyond the circle of light cast by these;
while the steady tramp of so many footsteps covered the noise we made. We were in no danger
of being noticed, and in a twinkling we turned our backs, and as fast as we could we ran down
the road. Fortunately, they were thinking more of secrecy than speed, and in a minute we had
doubled the distance between them and us. In two minutes their lights were mere sparks shining
in the gloom behind us. We lost even the tramp of their feet. Then I began to look out and
go more slowly, peering into the shadows on either side for the fernstack.

On one hand the hill rose steeply, on the other it fell away to the stream. On neither side
was close wood, or my difficulties had been immensely increased; but scattered oak trees stood
here and there among the bracken. This helped me, and presently, on the upper side, I came
upon the dense substance of the stack looming black against the lighter hill.

My heart beat fast, but it was no time for thought. Bidding the man in a whisper to follow
me and be ready to back me up, I climbed the bank softly, and, with a pistol in my hand, felt
my way to the rear of the stack, thinking to find a hut there, set against the fern, and M.
Cocheforet in it. But I found no hut. There was none; and, moreover, it was so dark now we
were off the road, that it came upon me suddenly, as I stood between the hill and the stack,
that I had undertaken a very difficult thing. The hut behind the fern stack. But how far behind?
how far from it? The dark slope stretched above us, infinite, immeasurable shrouded in night.
To begin to climb it in search of a tiny hut, possibly well hidden and hard to find in daylight,
seemed an endeavour as hopeless as to meet with the needle in the hay! And now while I stood,
chilled and doubting, almost despairing, the steps of the troop in the road began to grow audible,
began to come nearer.

'Well, Monsieur le Capitaine?' the man beside me muttered--in wonder why I stood. 'Which way?
or they will be before us yet.'

I tried to think, to reason it out; to consider where the hut should be; while the wind sighed
through the oaks, and here and there I could hear an acorn fall. But the thing pressed too
close on me; my thoughts would not be hurried, and at last I said at a venture,--

'Up the hill. Straight up from the stack.'

He did not demur, and we plunged at the ascent, knee-deep in bracken and furze, sweating at
every pore with our exertions, and hearing the troop come every moment nearer on the road below.
Doubtless they knew exactly whither to go! Forced to stop and take breath when we had scrambled
up fifty yards or so, I saw their lanthorns shining like moving glow-worms; I could even hear
the clink of steel. For all I could tell, the hut might be down there, and we be moving from
it. But it was too late to go back now--they were close to the fern-stack; and in despair I
turned to the hill again. A dozen steps and I stumbled. I rose and plunged on again; again
stumbled. Then I found that I was treading level earth. And--was it water I saw before me,
below me? or some mirage of the sky?

Neither; and I gripped my fellow's arm, as he came abreast of me, and stopped him sharply.
Below us in the middle of a steep hollow, a pit in the hill-side, a light shone out through
some aperture and quivered on the mist, like the pale lamp of a moorland hobgoblin. It made
itself visible, displaying nothing else; a wisp of light in the bottom of a black bowl. Yet
my spirits rose with a great bound at sight of it; for I knew that I had stumbled on the place
I sought.

In the common run of things I should have weighed my next step carefully, and gone about it
slowly. But here was no place for thought, nor room for delay; and I slid down the side of
the hollow on the instant, and the moment my feet touched the bottom sprang to the door of
the little hut, whence the light issued. Them mention i crossed at self-help whenever i become valley,

 Another horse was being led up and down by Louis, and, alas! my heart moved at the
sight, for it bore a lady's saddle. We were to have company then. Was it Madame who meant to
come with us, or Mademoiselle? And how far? To Auch?

I suppose that they had set some kind of a watch on me, for as I walked up M. de Cocheforet
and his sister came out of the house; he with a pale face and bright eyes, and a twitching
visible in his cheek--though he still affected a jaunty bearing; she wearing a black mask.

'Mademoiselle accompanies us?' I said formally.

'With your permission, Monsieur,' he answered with bitter politeness. But I saw that he was
choking with emotion; he had just parted from his wife, and I turned away.

When we were all mounted he looked at me.

'Perhaps--as you have my parole, you will permit me to ride alone?' he said with a little hesitation.
'And--'

'Without me!' I rejoined keenly. 'Assuredly, so far as is possible.'

Accordingly I directed the troopers to ride before him, keeping out of earshot, while my two
men followed him at a little distance with their carbines on their knees. Last of all, I rode
myself with my eyes open and a pistol loose in my holster. M. de Cocheforet muttered a sneer
at so many precautions and the mountain made of his request; but I had not done so much and
come so far, I had not faced scorn and insults to be cheated of my prize at last; and aware
that until we were beyond Auch there must be hourly and pressing danger of a rescue, I was
determined that he who should wrest my prisoner from me should pay dearly for it. Only pride,
and, perhaps, in a degree also, appetite for a fight, had prevented me borrowing ten troopers
instead of two.

As was wont I looked with a lingering eye and many memories at the little bridge, the narrow
woodland path, the first roofs of the village; all now familiar, all seen for the last time.
Up the brook a party of soldiers were dragging for the captain's body. A furlong farther on,
a cottage, burned by some carelessness in the night, lay a heap of black ashes. Louis ran beside
us weeping; the last brown leaves fluttered down in showers. And between my eyes and all, the
slow steady rain fell and fell. And so I left Cocheforet.

Louis went with us to a point a mile beyond the village, and there stood and saw us go, cursing
me furiously as I passed. Looking back when we had ridden on, I still saw him standing, and
after a moment's hesitation I rode back to him.

'Listen, fool!' I said, cutting him short in the midst of his mowing and snarling, 'and give
this message to your mistress. Tell her from me that it will be with her husband as it was
with M. de Regnier, when he fell into the hands of his enemy--no better and no worse.'

'You want to kill her, too, I suppose?' he answered glowering at me.

'No, fool, I want to save her,' I retorted wrathfully. 'Tell her that, just that and no more,
and you will see the result.'

'I shall not,' he said sullenly. 'A message from you indeed!' And he spat on the ground.

'Then on your head be it,' I answered solemnly, And I turned my horse's head and galloped fast
after the others. But I felt sure that he would report what I had said, if it were only out
of curiosity; and it would be strange if Madame, a gentlewoman of the south, bred among old
family traditions, did not understand the reference.

And so we began our journey; sadly, under dripping trees and a leaden sky. The country we had
to traverse was the same I had trodden on the last day of my march southwards, but the passage
of a month had changed the face of everything. Green dells, where springs welling out of the
chalk had once made of the leafy bottom a fairies' home, strewn with delicate ferns and hung
with mosses, were now swamps into which our horses sank to the fetlock. Sunny brews, whence
I had viewed the champaign and traced my forward path, had become bare, wind-swept ridges.
The beech woods that had glowed with ruddy light were naked now; mere black trunks and rigid
arms pointing to heaven. An earthy smell filled the air; a hundred paces away a wall of mist
closed the view. We plodded on sadly up hill and down hill, now fording brooks, already stained
with flood-water, now crossing barren heaths. But up hill or down hill, whatever the outlook,
I was never permitted to forget that I was the jailor, the ogre, the villain; that I, riding
behind in my loneliness, was the blight on all--the death-spot. True, I was behind the others--I
escaped their eyes. But there was not a line of Mademoiselle's figure that did not speak scorn
to me; not a turn of head that did not seem to say, 'Oh, God, that such a thing should breathe.'

I had only speech with her once during the day, and that was on the last ridge before we went
down into the valley to climb up again to Auch. The rain had ceased; the sun, near its setting,
shone faintly; for a few moments we stood on the brow and looked southwards while we breathed
the horses. The mist lay like a pall on the country we had traversed; but beyond and above
it, gleaming pearl-like in the level rays, the line of the mountains stood up like a land of
enchantment, soft, radiant, wonderful!--or like one of those castles on the Hill of Glass of
which the old romances tell us. I forgot for an instant how we were placed, and I cried to
my neighbour that it was the fairest pageant I had ever seen.

She--it was Mademoiselle, and she had taken off her mask--cast one look at me in answer; only
one, but it conveyed disgust and loathing so unspeakable that scorn beside them would have
been a gift. I reined in my horse as if she had struck me, and felt myself go first hot and
then cold under her eyes. Then she looked another way.

But I did not forget the lesson; and after that I avoided her more sedulously than before.
We lay that night at Auch, and I gave M. de Cocheforet the utmost liberty, even permitting
him to go out and return at his will. In the morning, believing that on the farther side of
Auch we ran little risk of attack, I dismissed the two dragoons, and an hour after sunrise
we set out again. The day was dry and cold, the weather more promising. I proposed to go by
way of Lectoure, crossing the Garonne at Agen; and I thought that, with roads continually improving
as we moved northwards, we should be able to make good progress before night. My two men rode
first, I came last by myself.

 One, whom I took to be the leader, was masked. He came furiously at me to
ride me down, but I leaped aside nimbly, and, evading him, rushed at the other, and scaring
his horse, so that he dropped his point, cut him across the shoulder, before he could guard
himself. He plunged away, cursing and trying to hold in his horse, and I turned to meet the
masked man.

'You villain!' he cried, riding at me again. This time he manoeuvred his horse so skilfully
that I was hard put to it to prevent him knocking me down; while I could not with all my efforts
reach him to hurt him. 'Surrender, will you?' he cried, 'you bloodhound!'

I wounded him slightly in the knee for answer; before I could do more his companion came back,
and the two set upon me, slashing at my head so furiously and towering above me with so great
an advantage that it was all I could do to guard it. I was soon glad to fall back against the
bank. In this sort of conflict my rapier would have been of little use, but fortunately I had
armed myself before I left Paris with a cut-and-thrust sword for the road; and though my mastery
of the weapon was not on a par with my rapier play, I was able to fend off their cuts, and
by an occasional prick keep the horses at a distance. Still, they swore and cut at me; and
it was trying work. A little delay might enable the other man to come to their help, or Mademoiselle,
for all I knew, might shoot me with my own pistol. I was unfeignedly glad when a lucky parade
sent the masked man's sword flying across the road. On that he pushed his horse recklessly
at me, spurring it without mercy; but the animal, which I had several times touched, reared
up instead, and threw him at the very moment that I wounded his companion a second time in
the arm, and made him give back.

The scene was now changed. The man in the mask staggered to his feet, and felt stupidly for
a pistol. But he could not find one, and he was in no state to use it if he had. He reeled
helplessly to the bank and leaned against it. The man I had wounded was in scarcely better
condition. He retreated before me, but in a moment, losing courage, let drop his sword, and,
wheeling round, cantered off, clinging to his pommel. There remained only the fellow engaged
with my man, and I turned to see how they were getting on. They were standing to take breath,
so I ran towards them; but on seeing me coming, this rascal, too, whipped round his horse and
disappeared in the wood, and left us victors.

The first thing I did--and I remember it to this day with pleasure--was to plunge my hand into
my pocket, take out half of all the money I had in the world, and press it on the man who had
fought for me so stoutly. In my joy I could have kissed him! It was not only that I had escaped
defeat by the skin of my teeth--and his good sword; but I knew, and felt, and thrilled with
the knowledge, that the fight had, in a sense, redeemed my character. He was wounded in two
places, and I had a scratch or two, and had lost my horse; and my other poor fellow was dead
as a herring. But, speaking for myself, I would have spent half the blood in my body to purchase
the feeling with which I turned back to speak to M. de Cocheforet and his sister. Mademoiselle
had dismounted, and with her face averted and her mask pushed on one side, was openly weeping.
Her brother, who had faithfully kept his place by the ford from the beginning of the fight
to the end, met me with raised eyebrows and a peculiar smile.

'Acknowledge my virtue,' he said airily. 'I am here, M. de Berault; which is more than can
be said of the two gentlemen who have just ridden off.'

'Yes,' I answered with a touch of bitterness. 'I wish that they had not shot my poor man before
they went.'

He shrugged his shoulders.

'They were my friends,' he said. 'You must not expect me to blame them. But that is not all,
M. de Berault.'

'No,' I said, wiping my sword. 'There is this gentleman in the mask.' And I turned to go towards
him.

'M. de Berault!' Cocheforet called after me, his tone strained and abrupt.

I stood. 'Pardon?' I said, turning.

'That gentleman?' he said, hesitating and looking at me doubtfully. 'Have you considered what
will happen to him if you give him up to the authorities?'

'Who is he?' I asked sharply.

'That is rather a delicate question,' he answered frowning.

'Not for me,' I replied brutally, 'since he is in my power. If he will take off his mask I
shall know better what I intend to do with him.'

The stranger had lost his hat in his fall, and his fair hair, stained with dust, hung in curls
on his shoulders. He was a tall man, of a slender, handsome presence, and, though his dress
was plain and almost rough, I espied a splendid jewel on his hand, and fancied that I detected
other signs of high quality. He still lay against the bank in a half-swooning condition, and
seemed unconscious of my scrutiny.

'Should I know him if he unmasked?' I said suddenly, a new idea in my head.

'You would,' M. de Cocheforet answered.

'And?'

'It would be bad for everyone.'

'Ho! ho!' I replied softly, looking hard first at my old prisoner, and then at my new one.
'Then--what do you wish me to do?'

'Leave him here!' M. de Cocheforet answered, his face flushed, the pulse in his cheek beating.

I had known him for a man of perfect honour before, and trusted him. But this evident earnest
anxiety on behalf of his friend touched me not a little. Besides, I knew that I was treading
on slippery ground: that it behoved me to be careful.

'I will do it,' I said after a moment's reflection. 'He will play me no tricks, I suppose?
A letter of--'

'MON DIEU, no! He will understand,' Cocheforet answered eagerly. 'You will not repent it. Let
us be going.'

'Well, but my horse?' I said, somewhat taken aback by this extreme haste. 'How am I to--'

'We shall overtake it,' he assured me. 'It will have kept the road. Lectoure is no more than
a league from here, and we can give orders there to have these two fetched and buried.'

I had nothing to gain by demurring, and so, after another word or two, it was arranged. We
picked up what we had dropped, M. de Cocheforet helped his sister to mount, and within five
minutes we were gone. Casting a glance back from the skirts of the wood I fancied that I saw
the masked man straighten himself and turn to look after us, but the leaves were beginning
to intervene, the distance may have cheated me. And yet I was not indisposed to think the unknown
a trifle more observant, and a little less seriously hurt, than he seemed.

She drooped over her horse's neck as she spoke, and began to weep so passionately that the
tears ran down her cheeks under her mask, and fell and sparkled like dew on the mane; while
her sobs shook her so that I thought she must fall. I stretched out my hand instinctively to
give her help, but she shrank from me. 'No!' she gasped, between her sobs. 'Do not touch me.
There is too much between us.'

'Yet there must be one thing more between us,' I answered firmly. 'You must listen to me a
little longer whether you will or no, Mademoiselle: for the love you bear to your brother.
There is one course still open to me by which I may redeem my honour; and it has been in my
mind for some time back to take that course. 'To-day, I am thankful to say, I can take it cheerfully,
if not without regret; with a steadfast heart, if no light one. Mademoiselle,' I continued
earnestly, feeling none of the triumph, none of the vanity, none of the elation I had foreseen,
but only simple joy in the joy I could give her, 'I thank God that it IS still in my power
to undo what I have done: that it is still in my power to go back to him who sent me, and telling
him that I have changed my mind, and will bear my own burdens, to pay the penalty.'

We were within a hundred paces of the top and the finger-post. She cried out wildly that she
did not understand. 'What is it you--you--have just said?' she murmured. 'I cannot hear.' And
she began to fumble with the ribbon of her mask.

'Only this, Mademoiselle,' I answered gently. 'I give your brother back his word, his parole.
From this moment he is free to go whither he pleases. Here, where we stand, four roads meet.
That to the right goes to Montauban, where you have doubtless friends, and can lie hid for
a time. Or that to the left leads to Bordeaux, where you can take ship if you please. And in
a word, Mademoiselle,' I continued, ending a little feebly, 'I hope that your troubles are
now over.'

She turned her face to me--we had both come to a standstill--and plucked at the fastenings
of her mask. But her trembling fingers had knotted the string, and in a moment she dropped
her hand with a cry of despair. 'But you? You?' she wailed in a voice so changed that I should
not have known it for hers. 'What will you do? I do not understand, Monsieur.'

'There is a third road,' I answered. 'It leads to Paris. That is my road, Mademoiselle. We
part here.'

'But why?' she cried wildly.

'Because from to-day I would fain begin to be honourable,' I answered in a low voice. 'Because
I dare not be generous at another's cost. I must go back whence I came.'

'To the Chatelet?' she muttered.

'Yes, Mademoiselle, to the Chatelet.'

She tried feverishly to raise her mask with her hand.

'I am not well,' she stammered. 'I cannot breathe.'

And she began to sway so violently in her saddle that I sprang down, and, running round her
horse's head, was just in time to catch her as she fell. She was not quite unconscious then,
for as I supported her, she cried out,--

'Do not touch me! Do not touch me! You kill me with shame!'

But as she spoke she clung to me; and I made no mistake. Those words made me happy. I carried
her to the bank, my heart on fire, and laid her against it just as M. de Cocheforet rode up.
He sprang from his horse, his eyes blazing, 'What is this?' he cried. 'What have you been saying
to her, man?'

'She will tell you,' I answered drily, my composure returning under his eye. 'Amongst other
things, that you are free. From this moment, M. de Cocheforet, I give you back your parole,
and I take my own honour. Farewell.'

He cried out something as I mounted, but I did not stay to heed or answer. I dashed the spurs
into my horse, and rode away past the cross-roads, past the finger-post; away with the level
upland stretching before me, dry, bare, almost treeless; and behind me, all I loved. Once,
when I had gone a hundred yards, I looked back and saw him standing upright against the sky,
staring after me across her body. And again a minute later I looked back. This time saw only
the slender wooden cross, and below it a dark blurred mass.

CHAPTER XIV. ST MARTIN'S EVE

It was late evening on the twenty-ninth of November when I rode into Paris through the Orleans
gate. The wind was in the north-east, and a great cloud of vapour hung in the eye of an angry
sunset. The air seemed to be heavy with smoke, the kennels reeked, my gorge rose at the city's
smell; and with all my heart I envied the man who had gone out of it by the same gate nearly
two months before, with his face to the south and the prospect of riding day after day and
league after league across heath and moor and pasture. At least he had had some weeks of life
before him, and freedom and the open air, and hope and uncertainty; while I came back under
doom, and in the pall of smoke that hung over the huddle of innumerable roofs saw a gloomy
shadowing of my own fate.

For make no mistake. A man in middle life does not strip himself of the worldly habit with
which experience has clothed him, does not run counter to all the hard saws and instances by
which he has governed his course so long, without shiverings and doubts and horrible misgivings,
and struggles of heart. At least a dozen times between the Loire and Paris I asked myself what
honour was, and what good it could do me when I lay rotting and forgotten; if I were not a
fool following a Jack o' Lanthorn; and whether, of all the men in the world, the relentless
man to whom I was returning would not be the first to gibe at my folly?

However, shame kept me straight; shame and the memory of Mademoiselle's looks and words. I
dared not be false to her again; I could not, after speaking so loftily, fall so low, And therefore--though
not without many a secret struggle and quaking--I came, on the last evening but one of November,
to the Orleans gate, and rode slowly and sadly through the streets by the Luxembourg on my
way to the Pont au Change.

The struggle had sapped my last strength, however; and with the first whiff of the gutters,
the first rush of barefooted gamins under my horse's hoofs, the first babel of street cries--the
first breath, in a word, of Paris--there came a new temptation; to go for one last night to
Zaton's, to see the tables again and the faces of surprise, to be for an hour or two the old
Berault. That would be no breach of honour, for in any case I could not reach the Cardinal
before to-morrow. And it could do no harm. It could make no change in anything. It would not
have been a thing worth struggling about, indeed; only--only I had in my inmost heart a suspicion
that the stoutest resolutions might lose their force in that atmosphere; and that there even
such a talisman as the memory of a woman's looks and words might lose its virtue.

Still, I think that I should have succumbed in the end if I had not received at the corner
of the Luxembourg a shock which sobered me effectually. As I passed the gates, a coach, followed
by two outriders, swept out of the Palace courtyard; it was going at a great pace, and I reined
my jaded horse on one side to give it room. By chance as it whirled by me, one of the leather
curtains flapped back, and I saw for a second by the waning light--the nearer wheels were no
more than two feet from my boot--a face inside.

A face and no more, and that only for a second. But it froze me. It was Richelieu's, the Cardinal's;
but not as I had been wont to see it--keen, cold, acute, with intellect and indomitable will
in every feature. This face was contorted with the rage of impatience, was grim with the fever
of haste, and the fear of death. The eyes burned under the pale brow, the moustache bristled,
the teeth showed through the beard; I could fancy the man crying 'Faster! Faster!' and gnawing
his nails in the impotence of passion; and I shrank back as if I had been struck. Louis', burg which hears

 Then he rang his bell, while I stood waiting and
confounded.

The man in black came from behind the screen.

'Take this letter and that gentleman to the upper guard-room,' the Cardinal said sharply. 'I
can hear no more,' he continued, frowning and raising his hand to forbid interruption. 'The
matter is ended, M. de Berault. Be thankful.'

In a moment I was outside the door, my head in a whirl, my heart divided between gratitude
and resentment. I would fain have stood to consider my position; but I had no time. Obeying
a gesture, I followed my guide along several passages, and everywhere found the same silence,
the same monastic stillness. At length, while I was dolefully considering whether the Bastille
or the Chatelet would be my fate, he stopped at a door, thrust the letter into my hands, and
lifting the latch, signed to me to enter.

I went in in amazement, and stopped in confusion. Before me, alone, just risen from a chair,
with her face one moment pale, the next crimson with blushes, stood Mademoiselle de Cocheforet.
I cried out her name.

'M. de Berault,' she said, trembling. --. Secundus [a] complied with friend.

I did yield he, where he said, looking the more willingly, as he shall
live no opinion, but rather confirm what has been burned by Messala.

tone, while her eyes grew on a sudden large with fear.

'Yes, Mademoiselle,' I said. 'I have seen him, and it is true, He has given me my life.'

'And--?'

'And sent me into imprisonment.'

'For how long?' she whispered.

'I do not know,' I answered. 'I fear during the King's pleasure.'

She shuddered.

'I may have done more harm than good,' she murmured, looking at me piteously. 'But I did it
for the best. I told him all, and perhaps I did harm.'

But to hear her accuse herself thus, when she had made this long and lonely journey to save
me, when she had forced herself into her enemy's presence, and had, as I was sure she had,
abased herself for me, was more than I could bear.

'Hush, Mademoiselle, hush!' I said, almost roughly. 'You hurt me. Koln were nowadays raise in COLONIA
