And she was very happy. I will not deny that she had some feeling of triumphant satisfaction
in the knowledge that she was envied. Such a feeling on her part was natural, and is natural
to all men and women who are conscious that they have done well in the adjustment of their
own affairs. As she herself had said, he was her bird, the spoil of her own gun, the product
of such capacity as she had in her, on which she was to live, and, if possible, to thrive during
the remainder of her life. Lily fully recognised the importance of the thing she was doing,
and, in soberest guise, had thought much of this matter of marriage. But the more she thought
of it the more satisfied she was that she was doing well. And yet she knew that there was a
risk. He who was now everything to her might die; nay, it was possible that he might be other
than she thought him to be; that he might neglect her, desert her, or misuse her. But she had
resolved to trust in everything, and, having so trusted, she would not provide for herself
any possibility of retreat. Her ship should go out into the middle ocean, beyond all ken of
the secure port from which it had sailed; her army should fight its battle with no hope of
other safety than that which victory gives. All the world might know that she loved him if
all the world chose to inquire about the matter. She triumphed in her lover, and did not deny
even to herself that she was triumphant.

Mrs Eames was delighted to see them. It was so good in Mr Crosbie to come over and call upon
such a poor, forlorn woman as her, and so good in Captain Dale; so good also in the dear girls,
who, at the present moment, had so much to make them happy at home at Allington! Little things,
accounted as bare civilities by others, were esteemed as great favours by Mrs Eames.

"And dear Mrs Dale? I hope she was not fatigued when we kept her up the other night so unconscionably
late?" Bell and Lily both assured her that their mother was none the worse for what she had
gone through; and then Mrs Eames got up and left the room, with the declared purpose of looking
for John and Mary, but bent, in truth, on the production of some cake and sweet wine which
she kept under lock and key in the little parlour.

"Don't let's stay here very long," whispered Crosbie.

"No, not very long," said Lily. "But when you come to see my friends you mustn't be in a hurry,
Mr Crosbie."

"He had his turn with Lady Julia," said Bell, "and we must have ours now."

"At any rate, Mrs Eames won't tell us to do our duty and to beware of being too beautiful,"
said Lily.

Mary and John came into the room before their mother returned; then came Mrs Eames, and a few
minutes afterwards the cake and wine arrived. It certainly was rather dull, as none of the
party seemed to be at their ease. The grandeur of Mr Crosbie was too great for Mrs Eames and
her daughter, and John was almost silenced by the misery of his position. He had not yet answered
Miss Roper's letter, nor had he even made up his mind whether he would answer it or no. And
then the sight of Lily's happiness did not fill him with all that friendly joy which he should
perhaps have felt as the friend of her childhood. To tell the truth, he hated Crosbie, and
so he had told himself; and had so told his sister also very frequently since the day of the party.

"I tell you what it is, Molly," he had said, "if there was any way of doing it, I'd fight that
man."

"What; and make Lily wretched?"

"She'll never be happy with him. I'm sure she won't. I don't want to do her any harm, but yet
I'd like to fight that man,--if I only knew how to manage it."

And then he bethought himself that if they could both be slaughtered in such an encounter it
would be the only fitting termination to the present state of things. In that way, too, there
would be an escape from Amelia, and, at the present moment, he saw none other.

When he entered the room he shook hands with all the party from Allington, but, as he told
his sister afterwards, his flesh crept when he touched Crosbie. Crosbie, as he contemplated
the Eames family sitting stiff and ill at ease in their own drawing-room chairs, made up his
mind that it would be well that his wife should see as little of John Eames as might be when
she came to London;--not that he was in any way jealous of her lover. He had learned everything
from Lily,--all, at least, that Lily knew,--and regarded the matter rather as a good joke.
"Don't see him too often," he had said to her, "for fear he should make an ass of himself."
Lily had told him everything,--all that she could tell; but yet he did not in the least comprehend
that Lily had, in truth, a warm affection for the young man whom he despised.

"Thank you, no," said Crosbie. "I never do take wine in the middle of the day."

"But a bit of cake?" And Mrs Eames by her look implored him to do her so much honour. She implored
Captain Dale, also, but they were both inexorable. I do not know that the two girls were at
all more inclined to eat and drink than the two men; but they understood that Mrs Eames would
be broken-hearted if no one partook of her delicacies. The little sacrifices of society are
all made by women, as are also the great sacrifices of life. A man who is good for anything
is always ready for his duty, and so is a good woman always ready for a sacrifice.

"We really must go now," said Bell, "because of the horses." And under this excuse they got away.

"You will come over before you go back to London, John?" said Lily, as he came out with the
intention of helping her mount, from which purpose, however, he was forced to recede by the
iron will of Mr Crosbie.

"Yes, I'll come over again--before I go. Good-bye."

"Good-bye, John," said Bell. "Good-bye, Eames," said Captain Dale. Crosbie, as he seated himself
in the saddle, made the very slightest sign of recognition, to which his rival would not condescend
to pay any attention. "I'll manage to have a fight with him in some way," said Eames to himself
as he walked back through the passage of his mother's house. And Crosbie, as he settled his
feet in the stirrups, felt that he disliked the young man more and more. It would be monstrous
to suppose that there could be aught of jealousy in the feeling; and yet he did dislike him
very strongly, and felt almost angry with Lily for asking him to come again to Allington. "I
must put an end to all that," he said to himself as he rode silently out of town.

"You must not snub my friends, sir," said Lily, smiling as she spoke, but yet with something
of earnestness in her voice. They were out of the town by this time, and Crosbie had hardly
uttered a word since they had left Mrs Eames's door. They were now on the high road, and Bell
and Bernard Dale were somewhat in advance of them.

"I never snub anybody," said Crosbie, petulantly; "that is unless they have absolutely deserved
snubbing."

"And have I deserved it? Because I seem to have got it," said Lily.

"Nonsense, Lily. I never snubbed you yet, and I don't think it likely that I shall begin. But
you ought not to accuse me of not being civil to your friends. In the first place I am as civil
to them as my nature will allow me to be. And, in the second place--"

"Well; in the second place--?"

"I am not quite sure that you are very wise to encourage that young man's friendship just at
present."

"That means, I suppose, that I am very wrong to do so?"

"No, dearest, it does not mean that. If I meant so I would tell you so honestly. I mean just
what I say. There can, I suppose, be no doubt that he has filled himself with some kind of
romantic attachment for you,--a foolish kind of love which I don't suppose he ever expected
to gratify, but the idea of which lends a sort of grace to his life. When he meets some young
woman fit to be his wife he will forget all about it, but till then he will go about fancying
himself a despairing lover. And then such a young man as John Eames is very apt to talk of
his fancies."

"I don't believe for a moment that he would mention my name to any one."

"But, Lily, perhaps I may know more of young men than you do."

"Yes, of course you do."

"And I can assure you that they are generally too well inclined to make free with the names
of girls whom they think that they like. You must not be surprised if I am unwilling that any
man should make free with your name."

After this Lily was silent for a minute or two. She felt that an injustice was being done to
her and she was not inclined to put up with it, but she could not quite see where the injustice
lay. A great deal was owing from her to Crosbie. In very much she was bound to yield to him,
and she was anxious to do on his behalf even more than her duty. But yet she had a strong conviction
that it would not be well that she should give way to him in everything. She wished to think
as he thought as far as possible, but she could not say that she agreed with him when she knew
that she differed from him. John Eames was an old friend whom she could not abandon, and so
much at the present time she felt herself obliged to say.

"But, Adolphus--"

"Well, dearest?"

"You would not wish me to be unkind to so very old a friend as John Eames? I have known him
all my life, and we have all of us had a very great regard for the whole family. His father
was my uncle's most particular friend."

"I think, Lily, you must understand what I mean. I don't want you to quarrel with any of them,
or to be what you call unkind. But you need not give special and pressing invitations to this
young man to come and see you before he goes back to London, and then to come and see you directly
you get to London. You tell me that he had some kind of romantic idea of being in love with
you;--of being in despair because you are not in love with him. It's all great nonsense, no
doubt, but it seems to me that under such circumstances you'd better--just leave him alone."

Again Lily was silent. These were her three last days, in which it was her intention to be
especially happy, but above all things to make him especially happy. On no account would she
say to him sharp words, or encourage in her own heart a feeling of animosity against him, and
yet she believed him to be wrong; and so believing could hardly bring herself to bear the injury.
Such was her nature, as a Dale. And let it be remembered that very many who can devote themselves
for great sacrifices, cannot bring themselves to the endurance of little injuries. Lily could
have given up any gratification for her lover, but she could not allow herself to have been
in the wrong, believing herself to have been in the right.

"I have asked him now, and he must come," she said.

"But do not press him to come any more."

"Certainly not, after what you have said, Adolphus. If he comes over to Allington, he will
see me in mamma's house, to which he has always been made welcome by her. Of course I understand
perfectly--"

"You understand what, Lily?"

But she had stopped herself, fearing that she might say that which would be offensive to him
if she continued.

"What is it you understand, Lily?"

"Do not press me to go on, Adolphus. As far as I can, I will do all that you want me to do."

"You meant to say that when you find yourself an inmate of my house, as a matter of course
you could not ask your own friends to come and see you. Was that gracious?"

"Whatever I may have meant to say, I did not say that. Nor in truth did I mean it. Pray don't
go on about it now. These are to be our last days, you know, and we shouldn't waste them by
talking of things that are unpleasant. After all poor Johnny Eames is nothing to me; nothing,
nothing. How can any one be anything to me when I think of you?"

But even this did not bring Crosbie back at once into a pleasant humour. Had Lily yielded to
him and confessed that he was right, he would have made himself at once as pleasant as the
sun in May. But this she had not done. She had simply abstained from her argument because she
did not choose to be vexed, and had declared her continued purpose of seeing Eames on his promised
visit. Crosbie would have had her acknowledge herself wrong, and would have delighted in the
privilege of forgiving her. But Lily Dale was one who did not greatly relish forgiveness, or
any necessity of being forgiven. So they rode on, if not in silence, without much joy in their
conversation. It was now late on the Monday afternoon, and Crosbie was to go early on the Wednesday
morning. What if these three last days should come to be marred with such terrible drawbacks
as these!

Bernard Dale had not spoken a word to his cousin of his suit, since they had been interrupted
by Crosbie and Lily as they were lying on the bank by the ha-ha. He had danced with her again
and again at Mrs Dale's party, and had seemed to revert to his old modes of conversation without
difficulty. Bell, therefore, had believed the matter to be over, and was thankful to her cousin,
declaring within her own bosom that the whole matter should be treated by her as though it
had never happened. To no one,--not even to her mother, would she tell it. To such reticence
she bound herself for his sake, feeling that he would be best pleased that it should be so.
But now as they rode on together, far in advance of the other couple, he again returned to
the subject.

"Bell," said he, "am I to have any hope?"

"Any hope as to what, Bernard?"

"I hardly know whether a man is bound to take a single answer on such a subject. But this I
know, that if a man's heart is concerned, he is not very willing to do so."

"When that answer has been given honestly and truly--"

"Oh, no doubt. I don't at all suppose that you were dishonest or false when you refused to
allow me to speak to you."

"But, Bernard, I did not refuse to allow you to speak to me."

"Something very like it. But, however, I have no doubt you were true enough. But, Bell, why
should it be so? If you were in love with any one else I could understand it."

"I am not in love with any one else."

"Exactly. And there are so many reasons why you and I should join our fortunes together."

"It cannot be a question of fortune, Bernard."

"Do listen to me. Do let me speak, at any rate. I presume I may at least suppose that you do
not dislike me."

"Oh, no."

"And though you might not be willing to accept any man's hand merely on a question of fortune,
surely the fact that our marriage would be in every way suitable as regards money should not
set you against it. Of my own love for you I will not speak further, as I do not doubt that
you believe what I say; but should you not question your own feelings very closely before you
determine to oppose the wishes of all those who are nearest to you?"

"Do you mean mamma, Bernard?"

"Not her especially, though I cannot but think she would like a marriage that would keep all
the family together, and would give you an equal claim to the property to that which I have."

"That would not have a feather's-weight with mamma."

"Have you asked her?"

"No, I have mentioned the matter to no one."

"Then you cannot know. And as to my uncle, I have the means of knowing that it is the great
desire of his life. I must say that I think some consideration for him should induce you to
pause before you give a final answer, even though no consideration for me should have any weight
with you."

"I would do more for you than for him,--much more."

"Then do this for me. Allow me to think that I have not yet had an answer to my proposal; give
me to this day month, to Christmas; till any time that you like to name, so that I may think
that it is not yet settled, and may tell Uncle Christopher that such is the case."

"Bernard, it would be useless."

"It would at any rate show him that you are willing to think of it."

"But I am not willing to think of it;--not in that way. I do know my own mind thoroughly, and
I should be very wrong if I were to deceive you."

"And you wish me to give that as your only answer to my uncle?"

"To tell the truth, Bernard, I do not much care what you may say to my uncle in this matter.
He can have no right to interfere in the disposal of my hand, and therefore I need not regard
his wishes on the subject. I will explain to you in one word what my feelings are about it.
I would accept no man in opposition to mamma's wishes; but not even for her could I accept
any man in opposition to my own. But as concerns my uncle, I do not feel myself called on to
consult him in any way on such a matter."

"And yet he is the head of our family."

"I don't care anything about the family,--not in that way."

"And he has been very generous to you all."

"That I deny. He has not been generous to mamma. "'ll promise," him come. Already, and was taken

why not travel she be?" was his statement. "Behalf as you'letter." "yes, lily." "you start?" "on

"how ready engineering you go middle?"

"be off in hr, foe." "nevertheless talk rearward and them." Off i begin; but, i had lift

the case with it, to babu state me made i would have to travel off.
 He was at this moment unhappy,
disappointed, anxious, distrustful of the future, and more intent on one special toy than he
had ever been before, even as a boy. He was vexed, and felt himself to be sore at heart. He
looked round at her, as she sat silent, quiet, and somewhat sad upon her pony, and declared
to himself that she was very beautiful,--that she was a thing to be gained if still there might
be the possibility of gaining her. He felt that he really loved her, and yet he was almost
angry with himself for so feeling. Why had he subjected himself to this numbing weakness? His
love had never given him any pleasure. Indeed he had never hitherto acknowledged it; but now
he was driven to do so on finding it to be the source of trouble and pain. I think it is open
to us to doubt whether, even yet, Bernard Dale was in love with his cousin; whether he was
not rather in love with his own desire. But against himself he found a verdict that he was
in love, and was angry with himself and with all the world.

"Ah, Bell," he said, coming close up to her, "I wish you could understand how I love you."
And, as he spoke, his cousin unconsciously recognised more of affection in his tone, and less
of that spirit of bargaining which had seemed to pervade all his former pleas, than she had
ever found before.

"And do I not love you? Have I not offered to be to you in all respects as a sister?"

"That is nothing. Such an offer to me now is simply laughing at me. Bell, I tell you what,--I
will not give you up. The fact is, you do not know me yet,--not know me as you must know any
man before you choose him for your husband. You and Lily are not alike in this. You are cautious,
doubtful of yourself, and perhaps, also, somewhat doubtful of others. My heart is set upon
this, and I shall still try to succeed."

"Ah, Bernard, do not say that! Believe me, when I tell you that it can never be."

"No; I will not believe you. I will not allow myself to be made utterly wretched. I tell you
fairly that I will not believe you. I may surely hope if I choose to hope. No, Bell, I will
never give you up,--unless, indeed, I should see you become another man's wife."

As he said this, they all turned in through the squire's gate, and rode up to the yard in which
it was their habit to dismount from their horses.

CHAPTER XIV

John Eames Takes a Walk

John Eames watched the party of cavaliers as they rode away from his mother's door, and then
started upon a solitary walk, as soon as the noise of the horses' hoofs had passed away out
of the street. He was by no means happy in his mind as he did so. Indeed, he was overwhelmed
with care and trouble, and as he went along very gloomy thoughts passed through his mind. Had
he not better go to Australia, or Vancouver's Island, or--? I will not name the places which
the poor fellow suggested to himself as possible terminations of the long journeys which he
might not improbably be called upon to take. That very day, just before the Dales had come
in, he had received a second letter from his darling Amelia, written very closely upon the
heels of the first. Why had he not answered her? Was he ill? Was he untrue? No; she would not
believe that, and therefore fell back upon the probability of his illness. If it was so, she
would rush down to see him. Nothing on earth should keep her from the bedside of her betrothed.
If she did not get an answer from her beloved John by return of post, she would be down with
him at Guestwick by the express train. Here was a position for such a young man as John Eames!
And of Amelia Roper we may say that she was a young woman who would not give up her game, as
long as the least chance remained of her winning it. "I must go somewhere," John said to himself,
as he put on his slouched hat and wandered forth through the back streets of Guestwick. What
would his mother say when she heard of Amelia Roper? What would she say when she saw her?

He walked away towards the Manor, so that he might roam about the Guestwick woods in solitude.
There was a path with a stile, leading off from the high road, about half a mile beyond the
lodges through which the Dales had ridden up to the house, and by this path John Eames turned
in, and went away till he had left the Manor house behind him, and was in the centre of the
Guestwick woods. He knew the whole ground well, having roamed there ever since he was first
allowed to go forth upon his walks alone. He had thought of Lily Dale by the hour together,
as he had lost himself among the oak-trees; but in those former days he had thought of her
with some pleasure. Now he could only think of her as of one gone from him for ever; and then
he had also to think of her whom he had taken to himself in Lily's place.

Young men, very young men,--men so young that it may be almost a question whether or no they
have as yet reached their manhood,--are more inclined to be earnest and thoughtful when alone
than they ever are when with others, even though those others be their elders. I fancy that,
as we grow old ourselves, we are apt to forget that it was so with us; and, forgetting it,
we do not believe that it is so with our children. We constantly talk of the thoughtlessness
of youth. I do not know whether we might not more appropriately speak of its thoughtfulness.
It is, however, no doubt, true that thought will not at once produce wisdom. It may almost
be a question whether such wisdom as many of us have in our mature years has not come from
the dying out of the power of temptation, rather than as the results of thought and resolution.
Men, full fledged and at their work, are, for the most part, too busy for much thought; but
lads, on whom the work of the world has not yet fallen with all its pressure,--they have time
for thinking.

And thus John Eames was thoughtful. They who knew him best accounted him to be a gay, good-hearted,
somewhat reckless young man, open to temptation, but also open to good impressions; as to whom
no great success could be predicated, but of whom his friends might fairly hope that he might
so live as to bring upon them no disgrace and not much trouble. But, above all things, they
would have called him thoughtless. In so calling him, they judged him wrong. He was ever thinking,--thinking
much of the world as it appeared to him, and of himself as he appeared to the world; and thinking,
also, of things beyond the world. What was to be his fate here and hereafter? Lily Dale was
gone from him, and Amelia Roper was hanging round his neck like a mill-stone! What, under such
circumstances, was to be his fate here and hereafter?

We may say that the difficulties in his way were not as yet very great. As to Lily, indeed,
he had no room for hope; but, then, his love for Lily had, perhaps, been a sentiment rather
than a passion. Most young men have to go through that disappointment, and are enabled to bear
it without much injury to their prospects or happiness. And in after-life the remembrance of
such love is a blessing rather than a curse, enabling the possessor of it to feel that in those
early days there was something within him of which he had no cause to be ashamed. I do not
pity John Eames much in regard to Lily Dale. And then, as to Amelia Roper,--had he achieved
but a tithe of that lady's experience in the world, or possessed a quarter of her audacity,
surely such a difficulty as that need not have stood much in his way! What could Amelia do
to him if he fairly told her that he was not minded to marry her? In very truth he had never
promised to do so. He was in no way bound to her, not even by honour. Honour, indeed, with
such as her! But men are cowards before women until they become tyrants; and are easy dupes,
till of a sudden they recognise the fact that it is pleasanter to be the victimiser than the
victim,--and as easy. There are men, indeed, who never learn the latter lesson.

But, though the cause for fear was so slight, poor John Eames was thoroughly afraid. Little
things which, in connection with so deep a sorrow as his, it is almost ridiculous to mention,
added to his embarrassments, and made an escape from them seem to him to be impossible. He
could not return to London without going to Burton Crescent, because his clothes were there,
and because he owed to Mrs Roper some small sum of money which on his return to London he would
not have immediately in his pocket. He must therefore meet Amelia, and he knew that he had
not the courage to tell a girl, face to face, that he did not love her, after he had been once
induced to say that he did do so. His boldest conception did not go beyond the writing of a
letter in which he would renounce her, and removing himself altogether from that quarter of
the town in which Burton Crescent was situated. But then about his clothes, and that debt of
his? And what if Amelia should in the meantime come down to Guestwick and claim him? Could
he in his mother's presence declare that she had no right to make such claim? The difficulties,
in truth, were not very great, but they were too heavy for that poor young clerk from the Income-tax
Office.

You will declare that he must have been a fool and a coward. Yet he could read and understand
Shakespeare. He knew much,--by far too much,--of Byron's poetry by heart. He was a deep critic,
often writing down his criticisms in a lengthy journal which he kept. He could write quickly,
and with understanding; and I may declare that men at his office had already ascertained that
he was no fool. He knew his business, and could do it,--as many men failed to do who were much
less foolish before the world. And as to that matter of cowardice, he would have thought it
the greatest blessing in the world to be shut up in a room with Crosbie, having permission
to fight with him till one of them should have been brought by stress of battle to give up
his claim to Lily Dale. Eames was no coward. He feared no man on earth. But he was terribly
afraid of Amelia Roper.

He wandered about through the old Manor woods very ill at ease. The post from Guestwick went
out at seven, and he must at once make up his mind whether or no he would write to Amelia on
that day. He must also make up his mind as to what he would say to her. He felt that he should
at least answer her letter, let his answer be what it might. Should he promise to marry her,--say,
in ten or twelve years' time? Should he tell her that he was a blighted being, unfit for love,
and with humility entreat of her that he might be excused? Or should he write to her mother,
telling her that Burton Crescent would not suit him any longer, promising her to send the balance
on receipt of his next payment, and asking her to send his clothes in a bundle to the Income-tax
Office? Or should he go home to his own mother, and boldly tell it all to her?

He at last resolved that he must write the letter, and as he composed it in his mind he sat
himself down beneath an old tree which stood on a spot at which many of the forest tracks met
and crossed each other. The letter, as he framed it here, was not a bad letter, if only he
could have got it written and posted. Every word of it he chose with precision, and in his
mind he emphasised every expression which told his mind clearly and justified his purpose.
"He acknowledged himself to have been wrong in misleading his correspondent, and allowing her
to imagine that she possessed his heart. He had not a heart at her disposal. He had been weak
not to write to her before, having been deterred from doing so by the fear of giving her pain;
but now he felt that he was bound in honour to tell her the truth. Having so told her, he would
not return to Burton Crescent, if it would pain her to see him there. He would always have
a deep regard for her,"--oh, Johnny!--"and would hope anxiously that her welfare in life might
be complete." That was the letter, as he wrote it on the tablets of his mind under the tree;
but the getting it put on to paper was a task, as he knew, of greater difficulty. Then, as
he repeated it to himself, he fell asleep.

"Young man," said a voice in his ear as he slept. At first the voice spoke as a voice from
his dream without waking him, but when it was repeated, he sat up and saw that a stout gentleman
was standing over him. For a moment he did not know where he was, or how he had come there;
nor could he recollect, as he saw the trees about him, how long he had been in the wood. But
he knew the stout gentleman well enough, though he had not seen him for more than two years.
"Young man," said the voice, "if you want to catch rheumatism, that's the way to do it. Why,
it's young Eames, isn't it?"

"Yes, my lord," said Johnny, raising himself up so that he was now sitting, instead of lying,
as he looked up into the earl's rosy face.

"I knew your father, and a very good man he was; only he shouldn't have taken to farming. People
think they can farm without learning the trade, but that's a very great mistake. I can farm,
because I've learned it. Don't you think you'd better get up?" Whereupon Johnny raised himself
to his feet. "Not but what you're very welcome to lie there if you like it. Only, in October,
you know--"

"I'm afraid I'm trespassing, my lord," said Eames. "I came in off the path, and--"

"You're welcome; you're very welcome. If you'll come up to the house, I'll give you some luncheon."
This hospitable offer, however, Johnny declined, alleging that it was late, and that he was
going home to dinner.

"Come along," said the earl. "You can't go any shorter way than by the house. Dear, dear, how
well I remember your father. He was a much cleverer man than I am,--very much; but he didn't
know how to send a beast to market any better than a child. By-the-by, they have put you into
a public office, haven't they?"

"Yes, my lord."

"And a very good thing, too,--a very good thing, indeed. But why were you asleep in the wood?
It isn't warm, you know. I call it rather cold." And the earl stopped, and looked at him, scrutinising
him, as though resolved to inquire into so deep a mystery.

"I was taking a walk, and thinking of something, I sat down."

"Leave of absence, I suppose?"

"Yes, my lord."

"Have you got into trouble? You look as though you were in trouble. Your poor father used to
be in trouble."

"I haven't taken to farming," said Johnny, with an attempt at a smile.

"Ha, ha, ha,--quite right. No, don't take to farming. Unless you learn it, you know, you might
just as well take to shoemaking;--just the same. You haven't got into trouble, then; eh?"

"No, my lord, not particularly."

"Not particularly! I know very well that young men do get into trouble when they get up to
London. If you want any--any advice, or that sort of thing, you may come to me; for I knew
your father well. Do you like shooting?"

"I never did shoot anything."

"Well, perhaps better not. To tell the truth, I'm not very fond of young men who take to shooting
without having anything to shoot at. By-the-by, now I think of it, I'll send your mother some
game." It may, however, here be fair to mention that game very often came from Guestwick Manor
to Mrs Eames. "And look here, cold pheasant for breakfast is the best thing I know of. Pheasants
at dinner are rubbish,--mere rubbish. Here we are at the house. Will you come in and have a
glass of wine?"

But this John Eames declined, pleasing the earl better by doing so than he would have done
by accepting it. Not that the lord was inhospitable or insincere in his offer, but he preferred
that such a one as John Eames should receive his proffered familiarity without too much immediate
assurance. He felt that Eames was a little in awe of his companion's rank, and he liked him
the better for it. He liked him the better for it, and was a man apt to remember his likings.
"If you won't come in, Good-bye," and he gave Johnny his hand.

"Good-evening, my lord," said Johnny.

"And remember this; it is the deuce of a thing to have rheumatism in your loins. I wouldn't
go to sleep under a tree, if I were you,--not in October. But you're always welcome to go anywhere
about the place."

"Thank you, my lord."

"And if you should take to shooting,--but I dare say you won't; and if you come to trouble,
and want advice, or that sort of thing, write to me. I knew your father well." And so they
parted, Eames returning on his road towards Guestwick.

For some reason, which he could not define, he felt better after his interview with the earl.
There had been something about the fat, good-natured, sensible old man, which had cheered him,
in spite of his sorrow. "Pheasants for dinner are rubbish,--mere rubbish," he said to himself,
over and over again, as he went along the road; and they were the first words which he spoke
to his mother, after entering the house.

"I wish we had some of that sort of rubbish," said she.

"So you will, to-morrow"; and then he described to her his interview.

"The earl was, at any rate, quite right about lying upon the ground. I wonder you can be so
foolish. And he is right about your poor father too. But you have got to change your boots;
and we shall be ready for dinner almost immediately."

But Johnny Eames, before he sat down to dinner, did write his letter to Amelia, and did go
out to post it with his own hands,--much to his mother's annoyance. But the letter would not
get itself written in that strong and appropriate language which had come to him as he was
roaming through the woods. It was a bald letter, and somewhat cowardly withal.

   DEAR AMELIA [the letter ran],

   I have received both of yours; and did not answer the first
   because I felt that there was a difficulty in expressing
   what I wish to say; and now it will be better that you
   should allow the subject to stand over till I am back in
   town. I shall be there in ten days from this. I have been
   quite well, and am so; but of course am much obliged by
   your inquiries. I know you will think this very cold; but
   when I tell you everything, you will agree with me that
   it is best. If I were to marry, I know that we should be
   unhappy, because we should have nothing to live on. If I
   have ever said anything to deceive you, I beg your pardon
   with all my heart;--but perhaps it will be better to let
   the subject remain till we shall meet again in London.

   Believe me to be

   Your most sincere friend,

   And I may say admirer,--[Oh, John Eames!]

   JOHN EAMES.

CHAPTER XV

The Last Day

Last days are wretched days; and so are last moments wretched moments. It is not the fact that
the parting is coming which makes these days and moments so wretched, but the feeling that
something special is expected from them, which something they always fail to produce. Spasmodic
periods of pleasure, of affection, or even of study, seldom fail of disappointment when premeditated.
When last days are coming, they should be allowed to come and to glide away without special
notice or mention. And as for last moments, there should be none such. Let them ever be ended,
even before their presence has been acknowledged.

But Lily Dale had not yet been taught these lessons by her world's experience, and she expected
that this sweetest cup of which she had ever drank should go on being sweet--sweeter and still
sweeter--as long as she could press it to her lips. How the dregs had come to mix themselves
with the last drops we have already seen; and on that same day,--on the Monday evening,--the
bitter task still remained; for Crosbie, as they walked about through the gardens in the evening,
found other subjects on which he thought it necessary to give her sundry hints, intended for
her edification, which came to her with much of the savour of a lecture. A girl, when she is
thoroughly in love, as surely was the case with Lily, likes to receive hints as to her future
life from the man to whom she is devoted; but she would, I think, prefer that such hints should
be short, and that the lesson should be implied rather than declared;--that they should, in
fact, be hints and not lectures. Crosbie, who was a man of tact, who understood the world and
had been dealing with women for many years, no doubt understood all this as well as we do.
But he had come to entertain a notion that he was an injured man, that he was giving very much
more than was to be given to him, and that therefore he was entitled to take liberties which
might not fairly be within the reach of another lover. My reader will say that in all this
he was ungenerous. Well; he was ungenerous. I do not know that I have ever said that much generosity
was to be expected from him. He had some principles of right and wrong under the guidance of
which it may perhaps be hoped that he will not go utterly astray; but his past life had not
been of a nature to make him unselfish. He was ungenerous, and Lily felt it, though she would
not acknowledge it even to herself. She had been very open with him,--acknowledging the depth
of her love for him; telling him that he was now all in all to her; that life without his love
would be impossible to her: and in a certain way he took advantage of these strong avowals,
treating her as though she were a creature utterly in his power;--as indeed she was.

On that evening he said no more of Johnny Eames, but said much of the difficulty of a man establishing
himself with a wife in London, who had nothing but his own moderate income on which to rely.
He did not in so many words tell her that if her friends could make up for her two or three
thousand pounds,--that being much less than he had expected when he first made his offer,--this
terrible difficulty would be removed; but he said enough to make her understand that the world
would call him very imprudent in taking a girl who had nothing. And as he spoke of these things,
Lily remaining for the most part silent as he did so, it occurred to him that he might talk
to her freely of his past life,--more freely than he would have done had he feared that he
might lose her by any such disclosures. He had no fear of losing her. Alas! might it not be
possible that he had some such hope!

He told her that his past life had been expensive; that, though he was not in debt, he had
lived up to every shilling that he had, and that he had contracted habits of expenditure which
it would be almost impossible for him to lay aside at a day's notice. Then he spoke of entanglements,
meaning, as he did so, to explain more fully what were their nature,--but not daring to do
so when he found that Lily was altogether in the dark as to what he meant. No; he was not a
generous man,--a very ungenerous man. And yet, during all this time, he thought that he was
guided by principle. "It will be best that I should be honest with her," he said to himself.
And then he told himself, scores of times, that when making his offer he had expected, and
had a right to expect, that she would not be penniless. Under those circumstances he had done
the best he could for her--offering her his heart honestly, with a quick readiness to make
her his own at the earliest day that she might think possible. Had he been more cautious, he
need not have fallen into this cruel mistake; but she, at any rate, could not quarrel with
him for his imprudence. And still he was determined to stand by his engagement and willing
to marry her, although, as he the more thought of it, he felt the more strongly that he would
thereby ruin his prospects, and thrust beyond his own reach all those good things which he
had hoped to win. As he continued to talk to her he gave himself special credit for his generosity,
and felt that he was only doing his duty by her in pointing out to her all the difficulties
which lay in the way of their marriage.

At first Lily said some words intended to convey an assurance that she would be the most economical
wife that man ever had, but she soon ceased from such promises as these. Her perceptions were
keen, and she discovered that the difficulties of which he was afraid were those which he must
overcome before his marriage, not any which might be expected to overwhelm him after it. "A
cheap and nasty ménage would be my aversion," he said to her. "It is that which I want to avoid,--chiefly
for your sake." Then she promised him that she would wait patiently for his time--"even though
it should be for seven years," she said, looking up into his face and trying to find there
some sign of approbation. "That's nonsense," he said. "People are not patriarchs nowadays.
I suppose we shall have to wait two years. And that's a deuce of a bore,--a terrible bore."
And there was that in the tone of his voice which grated on her feelings, and made her wretched
for the moment.

As he parted with her for the night on her own side of the little bridge which led from one
garden to the other, he put his arm round her to embrace her and kiss her, as he had often
done at that spot. It had become a habit with them to say their evening farewells there, and
the secluded little nook amongst the shrubs was inexpressibly dear to Lily. But on the present
occasion she made an effort to avoid his caress. She turned from him--very slightly, but it
was enough, and he felt it. "Are you angry with me?" he said. "Oh, no! Adolphus; how can I
be angry with you?" And then she turned to him and gave him her face to kiss almost before
he had again asked for it. "He shall not at any rate think that I am unkind to him,--and it
will not matter now," she said to herself, as she walked slowly across the lawn, in the dark,
up to her mother's drawing-room window.

"Well, dearest," said Mrs Dale, who was there alone; "did the beards wag merry in the Great
Hall this evening?" That was a joke with them, for neither Crosbie nor Bernard Dale used a
razor at his toilet.

"Not specially merry. And I think it was my fault, for I have a headache. Mamma, I believe
I will go at once to bed."

"My darling, is there anything wrong?"

"Nothing, mamma. But we had such a long ride; and then Adolphus is going, and of course we
have so much to say. To-morrow will be the last day, for I shall only just see him on Wednesday
morning; and as I want to be well, if possible, I'll go to bed." And so she took her candle
and went.

When Bell came up, Lily was still awake, but she begged her sister not to disturb her. "Don't
talk to me, Bell," she said. "I'm trying to make myself quiet, and I half feel that I should
get childish if I went on talking. I have almost more to think of than I know how to manage."
And she strove, not altogether unsuccessfully, to speak with a cheery tone, as though the cares
which weighed upon her were not unpleasant in their nature. Then her sister kissed her and
left her to her thoughts.

And she had great matter for thinking; so great, that many hours sounded in her ears from the
clock on the stairs before she brought her thoughts to a shape that satisfied herself. She
did so bring them at last, and then she slept. She did so bring them, toiling over her work
with tears that made her pillow wet, with heart-burning and almost with heart-breaking, with
much doubting, and many anxious, eager inquiries within her own bosom as to that which she
ought to do, and that which she could endure to do. But at last her resolve was taken, and
then she slept.

It had been agreed between them that Crosbie should come down to the Small House on the next
day after breakfast, and remain there till the time came for riding. But Lily determined to
alter this arrangement, and accordingly put on her hat immediately after breakfast, and posted
herself at the bridge, so as to intercept her lover as he came. He soon appeared with his friend
Dale, and she at once told him her purpose.

"I want to have a talk with you, Adolphus, before you go in to mamma; so come with me into
the field."

"All right," said he.

"And Bernard can finish his cigar on the lawn. Mamma and Bell will join him there."

"All right," said Bernard. So they separated; and Crosbie went away with Lily into the field
where they had first learned to know each other in those haymaking days.

She did not say much till they were well away from the house; but answered what words he chose
to speak,--not knowing very well of what he spoke. But when she considered that they had reached
the proper spot, she began very abruptly.

"Adolphus," she said, "I have something to say to you,--something to which you must listen
very carefully." Then he looked at her, and at once knew that she was in earnest.

"This is the last day on which I could say it," she continued; "and I am very glad that I have
not let the last day go by without saying it. I should not have known how to put it in a letter."

"What is it, Lily?"

"And I do not know that I can say it properly; but I hope that you will not be hard upon me.
Adolphus, if you wish that all this between us should be over, I will consent."

"Lily!"

"I mean what I say. If you wish it, I will consent; and when I have said so, proposing it myself,
you may be quite sure that I shall never blame you, if you take me at my word."

"Are you tired of me, Lily?"

"No. I shall never be tired of you,--never weary with loving you. I did not wish to say so
now; but I will answer your question boldly. Tired of you! I fancy that a girl can never grow
tired of her lover. But I would sooner die in the struggle than be the cause of your ruin.
It would be better--in every way better."

"I have said nothing of being ruined."

"But listen to me. I should not die if you left me,--not be utterly broken-hearted. Nothing
on earth can I ever love as I have loved you. But I have a God and a Saviour that will be enough
for me. I can turn to them with content, if it be well that you should leave me. I have gone
to them, and--" But at this moment she could utter no more words. She had broken down in her
effort, losing her voice through the strength of her emotion. As she did not choose that he
should see her overcome, she turned from him and walked away across the grass.

Of course he followed her; but he was not so quick after her but that time had been given to
her to recover herself. "It is true," she said. "I have the strength of which I tell you. Though
I have given myself to you as your wife, I can bear to be divorced from you now,--now. And,
my love, though it may sound heartless, I would sooner be so divorced from you, than cling
to you as a log that must drag you down under the water, and drown you in trouble and care.
I would;--indeed I would. If you go, of course that kind of thing is over for me. But the world
has more than that,--much more; and I would make myself happy,--yes, my love, I would be happy.
You need not fear that."

"But, Lily, why is all this said to me here to-day?"

"Because it is my duty to say it. I understand all your position now, though it is only now.
It never flashed on me till yesterday. When you proposed to me, you thought that I--that I
had some fortune."

"Never mind that now, Lily."

"But you did. I see it all now. I ought perhaps to have told you that it was not so. There
has been the mistake, and we are both sufferers. But we need not make the suffering deeper
than needs be. My love, you are free,--from this moment. And even my heart shall not blame
you for accepting your freedom."

"And are you afraid of poverty?" he asked her.

"I am afraid of poverty for you. You and I have lived differently. Luxuries, of which I know
nothing, have been your daily comforts. I tell you I can bear to part with you, but I cannot
bear to become the source of your unhappiness. Yes; I will bear it; and none shall dare in
my hearing to speak against you. I have brought you here to say the word; nay, more than that,--to
advise you to say it."

He stood silent for a moment, during which he held her by the hand. She was looking into his
face, but he was looking away into the clouds; striving to appear as though he was the master
of the occasion. But during those moments his mind was wracked with doubt. What if he should
take her at her word? Some few would say bitter things against him, but such bitter things
had been said against many another man without harming him. Would it not be well for both if
he should take her at her word? She would recover and love again, as other girls had done;
and as for him, he would thus escape from the ruin at which he had been gazing for the last
week past. For it was ruin,--utter ruin. He did love her; so he declared to himself. But was
he a man who ought to throw the world away for love? Such men there were; but was he one of
them? Could he be happy in that small house, somewhere near the New Road, with five children
and horrid misgivings as to the baker's bill? Of all men living, was not he the last that should
have allowed himself to fall into such a trap? All this passed through his mind as he turned
his face up to the clouds with a look that was intended to be grand and noble.

"Speak to me, Adolphus, and say that it shall be so."

Then his heart misgave him, and he lacked the courage to extricate himself from his trouble;
or, as he afterwards said to himself, he had not the heart to do it. "If I understand you,
rightly, Lily, all this comes from no want of love on your own part?"

"Want of love on my part? But you should not ask me that."

"Until you tell me that there is such a want, I will agree to no parting." Then he took her
hand and put it within his arm. "No, Lily; whatever may be our cares and troubles, we are bound
together,--indissolubly."

"Are we?" said she; and as she spoke, her voice trembled, and her hand shook.

"Much too firmly for any such divorce as that. No, Lily, I claim the right to tell you all
my troubles; but I shall not let you go."

"But, Adolphus--" and the hand on his arm was beginning to cling to it again.

"Adolphus," said he, "has got nothing more to say on that subject. He exercises the right which
he believes to be his own, and chooses to retain the prize which he has won."

She was now clinging to him in very truth. "Oh, my love!" she said. "I do not know how to say
it again. It is of you that I am thinking;--of you, of you!"

"I know you are; but you have misunderstood me a little; that's all."

"Have I? Then listen to me again, once more, my heart's own darling, my love, my husband, my
lord! If I cannot be to you at once like Ruth, and never cease from coming after you, my thoughts
to you shall be like those of Ruth;--if aught but death part thee and me, may God do so to
me and more also." Then she fell upon his breast and wept.

He still hardly understood the depth of her character. He was not himself deep enough to comprehend
it all. But yet he was awed by her great love, and exalted to a certain solemnity of feeling
which for the time made him rejoice in his late decision. For a few hours he was minded to
throw the world behind him, and wear this woman, as such a woman should be worn,--as a comforter
to him in all things, and a strong shield against great troubles. "Lily," he said, "my own Lily!"

"Yes, your own, to take when you please, and leave untaken while you please; and as much your
own in one way as in the other." Then she looked up again, and essayed to laugh as she did
so. "You will think I am frantic, but I am so happy. I don't care about your going now; indeed
I don't. There; you may go now, this minute, if you like it." And she withdrew her hand from
his. "I feel so differently from what I have done for the last few days. I am so glad you have
spoken to me as you did. Of course I ought to bear all those things with you. But I cannot
be unhappy about it now. I wonder if I went to work and made a lot of things, whether that
would help?"

"A set of shirts for me, for instance?"

"I could do that, at any rate."

"It may come to that yet, some of these days."

"I pray God that it may." Then again she was serious, and the tears came once more into her
eyes. "I pray God that it may. To be of use to you,--to work for you,--to do something for
you that may have in it some sober, earnest purport of usefulness,--that is what I want above
all things. I want to be with you at once that I may be of service to you. Would that you and
I were alone together, that I might do everything for you. I sometimes think that a very poor
man's wife is the happiest, because she does do everything."

"You shall do everything very soon," said he; and then they sauntered along pleasantly through
the morning hours, and when they again appeared at Mrs Dale's table, Mrs Dale and Bell were
astonished at Lily's brightness. All her old ways had seemed to return to her, and she made
her little saucy speeches to Mr Crosbie as she had used to do when he was first becoming fascinated
by her sweetness. "You know that you'll be such a swell when you get to that countess's house
that you'll forget all about Allington."

"Of course I shall," said he.

"And the paper you write upon will be all over coronets,--that is, if ever you do write. Perhaps
you will to Bernard some day, just to show that you are staying at a castle."

"You certainly don't deserve that he should write to you," sad Mrs Dale.

"I don't expect it for a moment,--not till he gets back to London and finds that he has nothing
else to do at his office. But I should so like to see how you and Lady Julia get on together.
It was quite clear that she regarded you as an ogre; didn't she, Bell?"

"So many people are ogres to Lady Julia," said Bell.

"I believe Lady Julia to be a very good woman," said Mrs Dale, "and I won't have her abused."

"Particularly before poor Bernard, who is her pet nephew," said Lily. "I dare say Adolphus
will become a pet too when she has been a week with him at Courcy Castle. Do try and cut Bernard
out."

From all which Mrs Dale learned that some care which had sat heavy on Lily's heart was now
lightened, if not altogether removed. She had asked no questions of her daughter, but she had
perceived during the past few days that Lily was in trouble, and she knew that such trouble
had arisen from her engagement. She had asked no questions, but of course she had been told
what was Mr Crosbie's income, and had been made to understand that it was not to be considered
as amply sufficient for all the wants of matrimony. There was little difficulty in guessing
what was the source of Lily's care, and as little in now perceiving that something had been
said between them by which that care had been relieved.

After that they all rode, and the afternoon went by pleasantly. It was the last day indeed,
but Lily had determined that she would not be sad. She had told him that he might go now, and
that she would not be discontented at his going. She knew that the morrow would be very blank
to her; but she struggled to live up to the spirit of her promise, and she succeeded. They
all dined at the Great House, even Mrs Dale doing so upon this occasion. When they had come
in from the garden in the evening, Crosbie talked more to Mrs Dale than he did even to Lily,
while Lily sat a little distant, listening with all her ears, sometimes saying a low-toned
word, and happy beyond expression in the feeling that her mother and her lover should understand
each other. And it must be understood that Crosbie at this time was fully determined to conquer
the difficulties of which he had thought so much, and to fix the earliest day which might be
possible for his marriage. The solemnity of that meeting in the field still hung about him,
and gave to his present feelings a manliness and a truth of purpose which were too generally
wanting to them. If only those feelings would last! But now he talked to Mrs Dale about her
daughter, and about their future prospects, in a tone which he could not have used had not
his mind for the time been true to her. He had never spoken so freely to Lily's mother, and
at no time had Mrs Dale felt for him so much of a mother's love. He apologised for the necessity
of some delay, arguing that he could not endure to see his young wife without the comfort of
a home of her own, and that he was now, as he always had been, afraid of incurring debt. Mrs
Dale disliked waiting engagements,--as do all mothers,--but she could not answer unkindly to
such pleading as this.

"Lily is so very young," she said, "that she may well wait for a year or so."

"For seven years," said Lily, jumping up and whispering into her mother's ear. "I shall hardly
be six-and-twenty then, which is not at all too old."

And so the evening passed away very pleasantly.

"God bless you, Adolphus!" Mrs Dale said to him, as she parted with him at her own door. It
was the first time that she had called him by his Christian name. "I hope you understand how
much we are trusting to you."

"I do,--I do," said he, as he pressed her hand. Then as he walked back alone, he swore to himself,
binding himself to the oath with all his heart, that he would be true to those women,--both
to the daughter and to the mother; for the solemnity of the morning was still upon him.

He was to start the next morning before eight, Bernard having undertaken to drive him over
to the railway at Guestwick. The breakfast was on the table shortly after seven; and just as
the two men had come down, Lily entered the room, with her hat and shawl. "I said I would be
in to pour out your tea," said she; and then she sat herself down over against the teapot.

It was a silent meal, for people do not know what to say in those last minutes. And Bernard,
too, was there; proving how true is the adage which says, that two are company, but that three
are not. I think that Lily was wrong to come up on that last morning; but she would not hear
of letting him start without seeing him, when her lover had begged her not to put herself to
so much trouble. Trouble! Would she not have sat up all night to see even the last of the top
of his hat?

Then Bernard, muttering something about the horse, went away. "I have only one minute to speak
to you," said she, jumping up, "and I have been thinking all night of what I had to say. It
is so easy to think, and so hard to speak."

"My darling, I understand it all."

"But you must understand this, that I will never distrust you. I will never ask you to give
me up again, or say that I could be happy without you. I could not live without you; that is,
without the knowledge that you are mine. But I will never be impatient, never. Pray, pray believe
me! Nothing shall make me distrust you."

"Dearest Lily, I will endeavour to give you no cause."

"I know you will not; but I specially wanted to tell you that. And you will write,--very soon?"

"Directly I get there."

"And as often as you can. But I won't bother you; only your letters will make me so happy.
I shall be so proud when they come to me. I shall be afraid of writing too much to you, for
fear I should tire you."

"You will never do that."

"Shall I not? But you must write first, you know. If you could only understand how I shall
live upon your letters! And now good-bye. There are the wheels. God bless you, my own, my own!"
And she gave herself up into his arms, as she had given herself up into his heart.

She stood at the door as the two men got into the gig, and, as it passed down through the gate,
she hurried out upon the terrace, from whence she could see it for a few yards down the lane.
Then she ran from the terrace to the gate, and, hurrying through the gate, made her way into
the churchyard, from the farther corner of which she could see the heads of the two men till
they had made the turn into the main road beyond the parsonage. There she remained till the
very sound of the wheels no longer reached her ears, stretching her eyes in the direction they
had taken. Then she turned round slowly and made her way out at the churchyard gate, which
opened on to the road close to the front door of the Small House.

"I should like to punch his head," said Hopkins, the gardener, to himself, as he saw the gig
driven away and saw Lily trip after it, that she might see the last of him whom it carried.
"And I wouldn't think nothing of doing it; no more I wouldn't," Hopkins added in his soliloquy.
It was generally thought about the place that Miss Lily was Hopkins's favourite, though he
showed it chiefly by snubbing her more frequently than he snubbed her sister.

Lily had evidently intended to return home through the front door; but she changed her purpose
before she reached the house, and made her way slowly back through the churchyard, and by the
gate of the Great House, and by the garden at the back of it, till she crossed the little bridge.
But on the bridge she rested awhile, leaning against the railing as she had often leant with
him, and thinking of all that had passed since that July day on which she had first met him.
On no spot had he so often told her of his love as on this, and nowhere had she so eagerly
sworn to him that she would be his own dutiful loving wife.

"And by God's help so I will," she said to herself, as she walked firmly up to the house. "He
has gone, mamma," she said, as she entered the breakfast-room. "And now we'll go back to our
work-a-day ways; it has been all Sunday for me for the last six weeks."

CHAPTER XVI

Mr Crosbie Meets an Old Clergyman on His Way to Courcy Castle

For the first mile or two of their journey Crosbie and Bernard Dale sat, for the most part,
silent in their gig. Lily, as she ran down to the churchyard corner and stood there looking
after them with her loving eyes, had not been seen by them. But the spirit of her devotion
was still strong upon them both, and they felt that it would not be well to strike at once
into any ordinary topic of conversation. And, moreover, we may presume that Crosbie did feel
much at thus parting from such a girl as Lily Dale, with whom he had lived in close intercourse
for the last six weeks, and whom he loved with all his heart,--with all the heart that he had
for such purposes. In those doubts as to his marriage which had troubled him he had never expressed
to himself any disapproval of Lily. He had not taught himself to think that she was other than
he would have her be, that he might thus give himself an excuse for parting from her. Not as
yet, at any rate, had he had recourse to that practice, so common with men who wish to free
themselves from the bonds with which they have permitted themselves to be bound. Lily had been
too sweet to his eyes, to his touch, to all his senses for that. He had enjoyed too keenly
the pleasure of being with her, and of hearing her tell him that she loved him, to allow of
his being personally tired of her. He had not been so spoilt by his club life but that he had
taken exquisite pleasure in all her nice country ways, and soft, kind-hearted, womanly humour.
He was by no means tired of Lily. Better than any of his London pleasures was this pleasure
of making love in the green fields to Lily Dale. It was the consequences of it that affrighted
him. Babies with their belongings would come; and dull evenings, over a dull fire, or else
the pining grief of a disappointed woman. He would be driven to be careful as to his clothes,
because the ordering of a new coat would entail a serious expenditure. He could go no more
among countesses and their daughters, because it would be out of the question that his wife
should visit at their houses. All the victories that he had ever won must be given up. He was
thinking of this even while the gig was going round the corner near the parsonage house, and
while Lily's eyes were still blessed with some view of his departing back; but he was thinking,
also, that moment, that there might be other victory in store for him; that it might be possible
for him to learn to like that fireside, even though babies should be there, and a woman opposite
to him intent on baby cares. He was struggling as best he knew how; for the solemnity which
Lily had imparted to him had not yet vanished from his spirit.

"I hope that, upon the whole, you feel contented with your visit?" said Bernard to him, at last.

"Contented? Of course I do."

"That is easily said; and civility to me, perhaps, demands as much. But I know that you have,
to some extent, been disappointed."

"Well; yes. I have been disappointed as regards money. It is of no use denying it."

"I should not mention it now, only that I want to know that you exonerate me."

"I have never blamed you;--neither you, nor anybody else; unless, indeed, it has been myself."

"You mean that you regret what you've done?"

"No; I don't mean that. I am too devotedly attached to that dear girl whom we have just left
to feel any regret that I have engaged myself to her. But I do think that had I managed better
with your uncle things might have been different."

"I doubt it. Indeed I know that it is not so; and can assure you that you need not make yourself
unhappy on that score. I had thought, as you well know, that he would have done something for
Lily;--something, though not as much as he always intended to do for Bell. But you may be sure
of this; that he had made up his mind as to what he would do. Nothing that you or I could have
said would have changed him."

"Well; we won't say anything more about it," said Crosbie. Then they went on again in silence,
and arrived at Guestwick in ample time for the train.

"Let me know as soon as you get to town," said Crosbie.

"Oh, of course. I'll write to you before that."

And so they parted. As Dale turned and went, Crosbie felt that he liked him less than he had
done before; and Bernard, also, as he was driving him, came to the conclusion that Crosbie
would not be so good a fellow as a brother-in-law as he had been as a chance friend. "He'll
give us trouble, in some way; and I'm sorry that I brought him down." That was Dale's inward
conviction in the matter.

Crosbie's way from Guestwick lay, by railway, to Barchester, the cathedral city lying in the
next county, from whence he purposed to have himself conveyed over to Courcy. There had, in
truth, been no cause for his very early departure, as he was aware that all arrivals at country
houses should take place at some hour not much previous to dinner. He had been determined to
be so soon upon the road by a feeling that it would be well for him to get over those last
hours. Thus he found himself in Barchester at eleven o'clock, with nothing on his hands to
do; and, having nothing else to do, he went to church. There was a full service at the cathedral,
and as the verger marshalled him up to one of the empty stalls, a little spare old man was
beginning to chant the Litany. "I did not mean to fall in for all this," said Crosbie, to himself,
as he settled himself with his arms on the cushion. But the peculiar charm of that old man's
voice soon attracted him;--a voice that, though tremulous, was yet strong; and he ceased to
regret the saint whose honour and glory had occasioned the length of that day's special service.

"And who is the old gentleman who chanted the Litany?" he asked the verger afterwards, as he
allowed himself to be shown round the monuments of the cathedral.

"That's our precentor, sir, Mr Harding. You must have heard of Mr Harding." But Crosbie, with
a full apology, confessed his ignorance.

"Well, sir; he's pretty well known too, tho' he is so shy like. He's father-in-law to our dean,
sir; and father-in-law to Archdeacon Grantly also."

"His daughters have all gone into the profession, then?"

"Why, yes; but Miss Eleanor--for I remember her before she was married at all,--when they lived
at the hospital--"

"At the hospital?"

"Hiram's hospital, sir. He was warden, you know. You should go and see the hospital, sir, if
you never was there before. Well, Miss Eleanor,--that was his youngest,--she married Mr Bold
as her first. But now she's the dean's lady."

"Oh; the dean's lady, is she?"

"Yes, indeed. And what do you think, sir? Mr Harding might have been dean himself if he'd liked.
They did offer it to him."

"And he refused it?"

"Indeed he did, sir."

"Nolo decanari. I never heard of that before. What made him so modest?"

"Just that, sir; because he is modest. He's past his seventy now,--ever so much; but he's just
as modest as a young girl. A deal more modest than some of them. To see him and his granddaughter
together!"

"And who is his granddaughter?"

"Why Lady Dumbello, as will be the Marchioness of Hartletop."

"I know Lady Dumbello," said Crosbie; not meaning, however, to boast to the verger of his noble
acquaintance.

"Oh, do you, sir?" said the man, unconsciously touching his hat at this sign of greatness in
the stranger; though in truth he had no love for her ladyship. "Perhaps you're going to be
one of the party at Courcy Castle."

"Well, I believe I am."

"You'll find her ladyship there before you. She lunched with her aunt at the deanery as she
went through, yesterday; finding it too much trouble to go out to her father's, at Plumstead.
Her father is the archdeacon, you know. They do say--but her ladyship is your friend!"

"No friend at all; only a very slight acquaintance. She's quite as much above my line as she
is above her father's."

"Well, she is above them all. They say she would hardly as much as speak to the old gentleman."

"What, her father?"

"No, Mr Harding; he that chanted the Litany just now. There he is, sir, coming out of the deanery."

They were now standing at the door leading out from one of the transepts, and Mr Harding passed
them as they were speaking together. He was a little, withered, shambling old man, with bent
shoulders, dressed in knee-breeches and long black gaiters, which hung rather loosely about
his poor old legs,--rubbing his hands one over the other as he went. And yet he walked quickly;
not tottering as he walked, but with an uncertain, doubtful step. The verger, as Mr Harding
passed, put his hand to his head, and Crosbie also raised his hat. Whereupon Mr Harding raised
his, and bowed, and turned round as though he were about to speak. Crosbie felt that he had
never seen a face on which traits of human kindness were more plainly written. But the old
man did not speak. He turned his body half round, and then shambled back, as though ashamed
of his intention, and passed on.

"He is of that sort that they make the angels of," said the verger. "But they can't make many
if they want them all as good as he is. I'm much obliged to you, sir." And he pocketed the
half-crown which Crosbie gave him.

"So that's Lady Dumbello's grandfather," said Crosbie, to himself, as he walked slowly round
the close towards the hospital, by the path which the verger had shown him. He had no great
love for Lady Dumbello, who had dared to snub him--even him. "They may make an angel of the
old gentleman," he continued to say; "but they'll never succeed in that way with the granddaughter."

He sauntered slowly on over a little bridge; and at the gate of the hospital he again came
upon Mr Harding. "I was going to venture in," said he, "to look at the place. But perhaps I
shall be intruding?"

"No, no; by no means," said Mr Harding. "Pray come in. I cannot say that I am just at home
here. I do not live here,--not now. But I know the ways of the place well, and can make you
welcome. That's the warden's house. Perhaps we won't go in so early in the day, as the lady
has a very large family. An excellent lady, and a dear friend of mine,--as is her husband."

"And he is warden, you say?"

"Yes, warden of the hospital. You see the house, sir. Very pretty, isn't it? Very pretty. To
my idea it's the prettiest built house I ever saw."

"I won't go quite so far as that," said Crosbie.

"But you would if you'd lived there twelve years, as I did. I lived in that house twelve years,
and I don't think there's so sweet a spot on the earth's surface. Did you ever see such turf
as that?"

"Very nice indeed," said Crosbie, who began to make a comparison with Mrs Dale's turf at the
Small House, and to determine that the Allington turf was better than that of the hospital.

"I had that turf laid down myself. There were borders there when I first came, with hollyhocks,
and those sort of things. The turf was an improvement."

"There's no doubt of that, I should say."

"The turf was an improvement, certainly. And I planted those shrubs, too. There isn't such
a Portugal laurel as that in the county."

"Were you warden here, sir?" And Crosbie, as he asked the question, remembered that, in his
very young days, he had heard of some newspaper quarrel which had taken place about Hiram's
hospital at Barchester.

"Yes, sir. I was warden here for twelve years. Dear, dear, dear! If they had put any gentleman
here that was not on friendly terms with me it would have made me very unhappy,--very. But,
as it is, I go in and out just as I like; almost as much as I did before they-- But they didn't
turn me out. There were reasons which made it best that I should resign."

"And you live at the deanery now, Mr Harding?"

"Yes; I live at the deanery now. But I am not dean, you know. My son-in-law, Dr Arabin, is
the dean. I have another daughter married in the neighbourhood, and can truly say that my lines
have fallen to me in pleasant places."

Then he took Crosbie in among the old men, into all of whose rooms he went. It was an almshouse
for aged men of the city, and before Crosbie had left him Mr Harding had explained all the
circumstances of the hospital, and of the way in which he had left it. "I didn't like going,
you know; I thought it would break my heart. But I could not stay when they said such things
as that;--I couldn't stay. And, what is more, I should have been wrong to stay. I see it all
now. But when I went out under that arch, Mr Crosbie, leaning on my daughter's arm, I thought
that my heart would have broken." And the tears even now ran down the old man's cheeks as he spoke.

It was a long story, and it need not be repeated here. And there was no reason why it should
have been told to Mr Crosbie, other than this,--that Mr Harding was a fond garrulous old man,
who loved to indulge his mind in reminiscences of the past. But this was remarked by Crosbie;
that, in telling his story, no word was said by Mr Harding injurious to any one. And yet he
had been injured,--injured very deeply. "It was all for the best," he said at last; "especially
as the happiness has not been denied to me of making myself at home at the old place. I would
take you into the house, which is very comfortable,--very, only it is not always convenient
early in the day, when there's a large family." In hearing which, Crosbie was again made to
think of his own future home and limited income.

He had told the old clergyman who he was, and that he was on his way to Courcy. "Where, as
I understand, I shall meet a granddaughter of yours."

"Yes, yes; she is my grandchild. She and I have got into different walks of life now, so that
I don't see much of her. They tell me that she does her duty well in that sphere of life to
which it has pleased God to call her."

"That depends," thought Crosbie, "on what the duties of a viscountess may be supposed to be."
But he wished his new friend good-bye, without saying anything further as to Lady Dumbello,
and, at about six o'clock in the evening, had himself driven up under the portico of Courcy Castle.

CHAPTER XVII

Courcy Castle

Courcy Castle was very full. In the first place, there was a great gathering there of all the
Courcy family. The earl was there,--and the countess, of course. At this period of the year
Lady de Courcy was always at home; but the presence of the earl himself had heretofore been
by no means so certain. He was a man who had been much given to royal visitings and attendances,
to parties in the Highlands, to,--no doubt necessary,--prolongations of the London season,
to sojournings at certain German watering-places, convenient, probably, in order that he might
study the ways and ceremonies of German Courts,--and to various other absences from home, occasioned
by a close pursuit of his own special aims in life; for the Earl de Courcy had been a great
courtier. But of late gout, lumbago, and perhaps also some diminution in his powers of making
himself generally agreeable, had reconciled him to domestic duties, and the earl spent much
of his time at home. The countess, in former days, had been heard to complain of her lord's
frequent absence. But it is hard to please some women,--and now she would not always be satisfied
with his presence.

And all the sons and daughters were there,--excepting Lord Porlock, the eldest, who never met
his father. The earl and Lord Porlock were not on terms, and indeed hated each other as only
such fathers and such sons can hate. The Honourable George de Courcy was there with his bride,
he having lately performed a manifest duty, in having married a young woman with money. Very
young she was not,--having reached some years of her life in advance of thirty; but then, neither
was the Honourable George very young; and in this respect the two were not ill-sorted. The
lady's money had not been very much,--perhaps thirty thousand pounds or so. But then the Honourable
George's money had been absolutely none. Now he had an income on which he could live, and therefore
his father and mother had forgiven him all his sins, and taken him again to their bosom. And
the marriage was matter of great moment, for the elder scion of the house had not yet taken
to himself a wife, and the de Courcy family might have to look to this union for an heir. The
lady herself was not beautiful, or clever, or of imposing manners,--nor was she of high birth.
But neither was she ugly, nor unbearably stupid. Her manners were, at any rate, innocent; and
as to her birth,--seeing that, from the first, she was not supposed to have had any,--no disappointment
was felt. Her father had been a coal-merchant. She was always called Mrs George, and the effort
made respecting her by everybody in and about the family was to treat her as though she were
a figure of a woman, a large well-dressed resemblance of a being, whom it was necessary for
certain purposes that the de Courcys should carry in their train. Of the Honourable George
we may further observe, that, having been a spendthrift all his life, he had now become strictly
parsimonious. Having reached the discreet age of forty, he had at last learned that beggary
was objectionable; and he, therefore, devoted every energy of his mind to saving shillings
and pence wherever pence and shillings might be saved. When first this turn came upon him both
his father and mother were delighted to observe it; but, although it had hardly yet lasted
over twelve months, some evil results were beginning to appear. Though possessed of an income,
he would take no steps towards possessing himself of a house. He hung by the paternal mansion,
either in town or country; drank the paternal wines, rode the paternal horses, and had even
contrived to obtain his wife's dresses from the maternal milliner. In the completion of which
little last success, however, some slight family dissent had showed itself.

The Honourable John, the third son, was also at Courcy. He had as yet taken to himself no wife,
and as he had not hitherto made himself conspicuously useful in any special walk of life his
family were beginning to regard him as a burden. Having no income of his own to save, he had
not copied his brother's virtue of parsimony; and, to tell the truth plainly, had made himself
so generally troublesome to his father, that he had been on more than one occasion threatened
with expulsion from the family roof. But it is not easy to expel a son. Human fledglings cannot
be driven out of the nest like young birds. An Honourable John turned adrift into absolute
poverty will make himself heard of in the world,--if in no other way, by his ugliness as he
starves. A thorough-going ne'er-do-well in the upper classes has eminent advantages on his
side in the battle which he fights against respectability. He can't be sent to Australia against
his will. He can't be sent to the poorhouse without the knowledge of all the world. He can't
be kept out of tradesmen's shops; nor, without terrible scandal, can he be kept away from the
paternal properties. The earl had threatened, and snarled, and shown his teeth; he was an angry
man, and a man who could look very angry; with eyes which could almost become red, and a brow
that wrinkled itself in perpendicular wrinkles, sometimes very terrible to behold. But he was
an inconsistent man, and the Honourable John had learned to measure his father, and in an accurate
balance.

I have mentioned the sons first, because it is to be presumed that they were the elder, seeing
that their names were mentioned before those of their sisters in all the peerages. But there
were four daughters,--the Ladies Amelia, Rosina, Margaretta, and Alexandrina. They, we may
say, were the flowers of the family, having so lived that they had created none of those family
feuds which had been so frequent between their father and their brothers. They were discreet,
high-bred women, thinking, perhaps, a little too much of their own position in the world, and
somewhat apt to put a wrong value on those advantages which they possessed, and on those which
they did not possess. The Lady Amelia was already married, having made a substantial if not
a brilliant match with Mr Mortimer Gazebee, a flourishing solicitor, belonging to a firm which
had for many years acted as agents to the de Courcy property. Mortimer Gazebee was now member
of Parliament for Barchester, partly through the influence of his father-in-law. That this
should be so was a matter of great disgust to the Honourable George, who thought that the seat
should have belonged to him. But as Mr Gazebee had paid the very heavy expenses of the election
out of his own pocket, and as George de Courcy certainly could not have paid them, the justice
of his claim may be questionable. Lady Amelia Gazebee was now the happy mother of many babies,
whom she was wont to carry with her on her visits to Courcy Castle, and had become an excellent
partner to her husband. He would perhaps have liked it better if she had not spoken so frequently
to him of her own high position as the daughter of an earl, or so frequently to others of her
low position as the wife of an attorney. But, on the whole, they did very well together, and
Mr Gazebee had gotten from his marriage quite as much as he expected when he made it.

The Lady Rosina was very religious; and I do not know that she was conspicuous in any other
way, unless it might be that she somewhat resembled her father in her temper. It was of the
Lady Rosina that the servants were afraid, especially with reference to that so-called day
of rest which, under her dominion, had become to many of them a day of restless torment. It
had not always been so with the Lady Rosina; but her eyes had been opened by the wife of a
great church dignitary in the neighbourhood, and she had undergone regeneration. How great
may be the misery inflicted by an energetic, unmarried, healthy woman in that condition,--a
woman with no husband, or children, or duties, to distract her from her work,--I pray that
my readers may never know.

The Lady Margaretta was her mother's favourite, and she was like her mother in all things,--except
that her mother had been a beauty. The world called her proud, disdainful, and even insolent;
but the world was not aware that in all that she did she was acting in accordance with a principle
which had called for much self-abnegation. She had considered it her duty to be a de Courcy
and an earl's daughter at all times; and consequently she had sacrificed to her idea of duty
all popularity, adulation, and such admiration as would have been awarded to her as a well-dressed,
tall, fashionable, and by no means stupid young woman. To be at all times in something higher
than they who were manifestly below her in rank,--that was the effort that she was ever making.
But she had been a good daughter, assisting her mother, as best she might, in all family troubles,
and never repining at the cold, colourless, unlovely life which had been vouchsafed to her.

Alexandrina was the beauty of the family, and was in truth the youngest. But even she was not
very young, and was beginning to make her friends uneasy lest she, too, should let the precious
season of hay-harvest run by without due use of her summer's sun. She had, perhaps, counted
too much on her beauty, which had been beauty according to law rather than beauty according
to taste, and had looked, probably, for too bounteous a harvest. That her forehead, and nose,
and cheeks, and chin were well-formed, no man could deny. Her hair was soft and plentiful.
Her teeth were good, and her eyes were long and oval. But the fault of her face was this,--that
when you left her you could not remember it. After a first acquaintance you could meet her
again and not know her. After many meetings you would fail to carry away with you any portrait
of her features. But such as she had been at twenty, such was she now at thirty. Years had
not robbed her face of its regularity, or ruffled the smoothness of her too even forehead.
Rumour had declared that on more than one, or perhaps more than two occasions, Lady Alexandrina
had been already induced to plight her troth in return for proffered love; but we all know
that Rumour, when she takes to such topics, exaggerates the truth, and sets down much in malice.
The lady was once engaged, the engagement lasting for two years, and the engagement had been
broken off, owing to some money difficulties between the gentlemen of the families. Since that
she had become somewhat querulous, and was supposed to be uneasy on that subject of her haymaking.
Her glass and her maid assured her that her sun shone still as brightly as ever; but her spirit
was becoming weary with waiting, and she dreaded lest she should become a terror to all, as
was her sister Rosina, or an object of interest to none, as was Margaretta. It was from her
especially that this message had been sent to our friend Crosbie; for, during the last spring
in London, she and Crosbie had known each other well. Yes, my gentle readers; it is true, as
your heart suggests to you. Under such circumstances Mr Crosbie should not have gone to Courcy
Castle.

Such was the family circle of the de Courcys. Among their present guests I need not enumerate
many. First and foremost in all respects was Lady Dumbello, of whose parentage and position
a few words were said in the last chapter. She was a lady still very young, having as yet been
little more than two years married. But in those two years her triumphs had been many;--so
many, that in the great world her standing already equalled that of her celebrated mother-in-law,
the Marchioness of Hartletop, who, for twenty years, had owned no greater potentate than herself
in the realms of fashion. But Lady Dumbello was every inch as great as she; and men said, and
women also, that the daughter-in-law would soon be the greater.

"I'll be hanged if I can understand how she does it," a certain noble peer had once said to
Crosbie, standing at the door of Sebright's, during the latter days of the last season. "She
never says anything to any one. She won't speak ten words a whole night through."

"I don't think she has an idea in her head," said Crosbie.

"Let me tell you that she must be a very clever woman," continued the noble peer. "No fool
could do as she does. Remember, she's only a parson's daughter; and as for beauty--"

"I don't admire her for one," said Crosbie.

"I don't want to run away with her, if you mean that," said the peer; "but she is handsome,
no doubt. I wonder whether Dumbello likes it."

Dumbello did like it. It satisfied his ambition to be led about as the senior lacquey in his
wife's train. He believed himself to be a great man because the world fought for his wife's
presence; and considered himself to be distinguished even among the eldest sons of marquises,
by the greatness reflected from the parson's daughter whom he had married. He had now been
brought to Courcy Castle, and felt himself proud of his situation because Lady Dumbello had
made considerable difficulty in according this week to the Countess de Courcy.

And Lady Julia De Guest was already there, the sister of the other old earl, who lived in the
next county. She had only arrived on the day before, but had been quick in spreading the news
as to Crosbie's engagement. "Engaged to one of the Dales, is he?" said the countess, with a
pretty little smile, which showed plainly that the matter was one of no interest to herself.
"Has she got any money?"

"Not a shilling, I should think," said the Lady Julia.

"Pretty, I suppose?" suggested the countess.

"Why, yes; she is pretty,--and a nice girl. I don't know whether her mother and uncle were
very wise in encouraging Mr Crosbie. I don't hear that he has anything special to recommend
him,--in the way of money I mean."

"I dare say it will come to nothing," said the countess, who liked to hear of girls being engaged
and then losing their promised husbands. She did not know that she liked it, but she did; and
already had pleasure in anticipating poor Lily's discomfiture. But not the less was she angry
with Crosbie, feeling that he was making his way into her house under false pretences.

And Alexandrina also was angry when Lady Julia repeated the same tidings in her hearing. "I
really don't think we care very much about it, Lady Julia," said she, with a little toss of
her head. "That's three times we've been told of Miss Dale's good fortune."

"The Dales are related to you, I think?" said Margaretta.

"Not at all," said Lady Julia, bristling up. "The lady whom Mr Crosbie proposes to marry is
in no way connected with us. Her cousin, who is the heir to the Allington property, is my nephew
by his mother." And then the subject was dropped.

Crosbie, on his arrival, was shown up into his room, told the hour of dinner, and left to his
devices. He had been at the castle before, and knew the ways of the house. So he sat himself
down to his table, and began a letter to Lily. But he had not proceeded far, not having as
yet indeed made up his mind as to the form in which he would commence it, but was sitting idly
with the pen in his hand, thinking of Lily, and thinking also how such houses as this in which
he now found himself would be soon closed against him, when there came a rap at his door, and
before he could answer the Honourable John entered the room.

 If he were to deny the fact to them the denial would
be very serious. And, indeed, was it possible that he should make such denial with Lady Julia
opposite to him?

Make such a denial! And was it the fact that he could wish to do so,--that he should think
of such falsehood, and even meditate on the perpetration of such cowardice? He had held that
young girl to his heart on that very morning. He had sworn to her, and had also sworn to himself,
that she should have no reason for distrusting him. He had acknowledged most solemnly to himself
that, whether for good or for ill, he was bound to her; and could it be that he was already
calculating as to the practicability of disowning her? In doing so must he not have told himself
that he was a villain? But in truth he made no such calculation. His object was to banish the
subject, if it were possible to do so; to think of some answer by which he might create a doubt.
It did not occur to him to tell the countess boldly that there was no truth whatever in the
report, and that Miss Dale was nothing to him. But might he not skilfully laugh off the subject,
even in the presence of Lady Julia? Men who were engaged did so usually, and why should not
he? It was generally thought that solicitude for the lady's feelings should prevent a man from
talking openly of his own engagement. Then he remembered the easy freedom with which his position
had been discussed throughout the whole neighbourhood of Allington, and felt for the first
time that the Dale family had been almost indelicate in their want of reticence. "I suppose
it was done to tie me the faster," he said to himself, as he pulled out the ends of his cravat.
"What a fool I was to come here, or indeed to go anywhere, after settling myself as I have
done." And then he went down into the drawing-room.

It was almost a relief to him when he found that he was not charged with his sin at once. He
himself had been so full of the subject that he had expected to be attacked at the moment of
his entrance. He was, however, greeted without any allusion to the matter. The countess, in
her own quiet way, shook hands with him as though she had seen him only the day before. The
earl, who was seated in his arm-chair, asked some one, out loud, who the stranger was, and
then, with two fingers put forth, muttered some apology for a welcome. But Crosbie was quite
up to that kind of thing. "How do, my lord?" he said, turning his face away to some one else
as he spoke; and then he took no further notice of the master of the house. "Not know him,
indeed!" Crippled though he was by his matrimonial bond, Crosbie felt that, at any rate as
yet, he was the earl's equal in social importance. After that, he found himself in the back
part of the drawing-room, away from the elder people, standing with Lady Alexandrina, with
Miss Gresham, a cousin of the de Courcys, and sundry other of the younger portion of the assembled
community.

"So you have Lady Dumbello here?" said Crosbie.

"Oh, yes; the dear creature!" said Lady Margaretta. "It was so good of her to come, you know."

"She positively refused the Duchess of St Bungay," said Alexandrina. "I hope you perceive how
good we've been to you in getting you to meet her. People have actually asked to come."

"I am grateful; but, in truth, my gratitude has more to do with Courcy Castle and its habitual
inmates, than with Lady Dumbello. Is he here?"

"Oh, yes! he's in the room somewhere. There he is, standing up by Lady Clandidlem. He always
stands in that way before dinner. In the evening he sits down much after the same fashion."

Crosbie had seen him on first entering the room, and had seen every individual in it. He knew
better than to omit the duty of that scrutinising glance; but it sounded well in his line not
to have observed Lord Dumbello.

"And her ladyship is not down?" said he.

"She is generally last," said Lady Margaretta.

"And yet she has always three women to dress her," said Alexandrina.

"But when finished, what a success it is!" said Crosbie.

"Indeed it is!" said Margaretta, with energy. Then the door was opened, and Lady Dumbello entered
the room.

There was immediately a commotion among them all. Even the gouty old lord shuffled up out of
his chair, and tried, with a grin, to look sweet and pleasant. The countess came forward, looking
very sweet and pleasant, making little complimentary speeches, to which the viscountess answered
simply by a gracious smile. Lady Clandidlem, though she was very fat and heavy, left the viscount,
and got up to join the group. Baron Potsneuf, a diplomatic German of great celebrity, crossed
his hands upon his breast, and made a low bow. The Honourable George, who had stood silent
for the last quarter of an hour, suggested to her ladyship that she must have found the air
rather cold; and the Ladies Margaretta and Alexandrina fluttered up with little complimentary
speeches to their dear Lady Dumbello, hoping this and beseeching that, as though the "Woman
in White" before them had been the dearest friend of their infancy.

She was a woman in white, being dressed in white silk, with white lace over it, and with no
other jewels upon her person than diamonds. Very beautifully she was dressed; doing infinite
credit, no doubt, to those three artists who had, between them, succeeded in turning her out
of hand. And her face, also, was beautiful, with a certain cold, inexpressive beauty. She walked
up the room very slowly, smiling here and smiling there; but still with very faint smiles,
and took the place which her hostess indicated to her. One word she said to the countess and
two to the earl. Beyond that she did not open her lips. All the homage paid to her she received
as though it were clearly her due. She was not in the least embarrassed, nor did she show herself
to be in the slightest degree ashamed of her own silence. She did not look like a fool, nor
was she even taken for a fool; but she contributed nothing to society but her cold, hard beauty,
her gait, and her dress. We may say that she contributed enough, for society acknowledged itself
to be deeply indebted to her.

The only person in the room who did not move at Lady Dumbello's entrance was her husband. But
he remained unmoved from no want of enthusiasm. A spark of pleasure actually beamed in his
eye as he saw the triumphant entrance of his wife. He felt that he had made a match that was
becoming to him as a great nobleman, and that the world was acknowledging that he had done
his duty. And yet Lady Dumbello had been simply the daughter of a country parson, of a clergyman
who had reached no higher rank than that of an archdeacon. "How wonderfully well that woman
has educated her," the countess said that evening in her dressing-room, to Margaretta. The
woman alluded to was Mrs Grantly, the wife of the parson and mother of Lady Dumbello.

The old earl was very cross because destiny and the table of precedence required him to take
out Lady Clandidlem to dinner. He almost insulted her, as she kindly endeavoured to assist
him in his infirm step rather than to lean upon him.

"Ugh!" he said, "it's a bad arrangement that makes two old people like you and me be sent out
together to help each other."

"Speak for yourself," said her ladyship, with a laugh. "I, at any rate, can get about without
any assistance,"--which, indeed, was true enough.

"It's well for you!" growled the earl, as he got himself into his seat.

And after that he endeavoured to solace his pain by a flirtation with Lady Dumbello on his
left. The earl's smiles and the earl's teeth, when he whispered naughty little nothings to
pretty young women, were phenomena at which men might marvel. Whatever those naughty nothings
were on the present occasion, Lady Dumbello took them all with placidity, smiling graciously,
but speaking hardly more than monosyllables.

Lady Alexandrina fell to Crosbie's lot, and he felt gratified that it was so. It might be necessary
for him, as a married man, to give up such acquaintances as the de Courcys, but he should like,
if possible, to maintain a friendship with Lady Alexandrina. What a friend Lady Alexandrina
would be for Lily, if any such friendship were only possible! What an advantage would such
an alliance confer upon that dear little girl;--for, after all, though the dear little girl's
attractions were very great, he could not but admit to himself that she wanted a something,--a
way of holding herself and of speaking, which some people call style. Lily might certainly
learn a great deal from Lady Alexandrina; and it was this conviction, no doubt, which made
him so sedulous in pleasing that lady on the present occasion.

And she, as it seemed, was well inclined to be pleased. She said no word to him during dinner
about Lily; and yet she spoke about the Dales, and about Allington, showing that she knew in
what quarters he had been staying, and then she alluded to their last parties in London,--those
occasions on which, as Crosbie now remembered, the intercourse between them had almost been
tender. It was manifest to him that at any rate she did not wish to quarrel with him. It was
manifest, also, that she had some little hesitation in speaking to him about his engagement.
He did not for a moment doubt that she was aware of it. And in this way matters went on between
them till the ladies left the room.

"So you're going to be married, too," said the Honourable George, by whose side Crosbie found
himself seated when the ladies were gone. Crosbie was employing himself upon a walnut, and
did not find it necessary to make any answer.

"It's the best thing a fellow can do," continued George; "that is, if he has been careful to
look to the main chance,--if he hasn't been caught napping, you know. It doesn't do for a man
to go hanging on by nothing till he finds himself an old man."

"You've feathered your own nest, at any rate."

"Yes; I've got something in the scramble, and I mean to keep it. Where will John be when the
governor goes off the hooks? Porlock wouldn't give him a bit of bread and cheese and a glass
of beer to save his life;--that is to say, not if he wanted it."

"I'm told your elder brother is going to be married."

"You've heard that from John. He's spreading that about everywhere to take a rise out of me.
I don't believe a word of it. Porlock never was a marrying man;--and, what's more, from all
I hear, I don't think he'll live long."

In this way Crosbie escaped from his own difficulty; and when he rose from the dinner-table
had not as yet been driven to confess anything to his own discredit.

But the evening was not yet over. When he returned to the drawing-room he endeavoured to avoid
any conversation with the countess herself, believing that the attack would more probably come
from her than from her daughter. He, therefore, got into conversation first with one and then
with another of the girls, till at last he found himself again alone with Alexandrina.

"Mr Crosbie," she said, in a low voice, as they were standing together over one of the distant
tables, with their backs to the rest of the company, "I want you to tell me something about
Miss Lilian Dale."

"About Miss Lilian Dale!" he said, repeating her words.

"Is she very pretty?"

"Yes; she certainly is pretty."

"And very nice, and attractive, and clever,--and all that is delightful? Is she perfect?"

"She is very attractive," said he; "but I don't think she's perfect."

"And what are her faults?"

"That question is hardly fair, is it? Suppose any one were to ask me what were your faults,
do you think I should answer the question?"

"I am quite sure you would, and make a very long list of them, too. But as to Miss Dale, you
ought to think her perfect. If a gentleman were engaged to me, I should expect him to swear
before all the world that I was the very pink of perfection."

"But supposing the gentleman were not engaged to you?"

"That would be a different thing."

"I am not engaged to you," said Crosbie. "Such happiness and such honour are, I fear, very
far beyond my reach. But, nevertheless, I am prepared to testify as to your perfection anywhere."

"And what would Miss Dale say?"

"Allow me to assure you that such opinions as I may choose to express of my friends will be
my own opinions, and not depend on those of any one else."

"And you think, then, that you are not bound to be enslaved as yet? How many more months of
such freedom are you to enjoy?"

Crosbie remained silent for a minute before he answered, and then he spoke in a serious voice.
"Lady Alexandrina," said he, "I would beg from you a great favour."

"What is the favour, Mr Crosbie?"

"I am quite in earnest. Will you be good enough, kind enough, enough my friend, not to connect
my name again with that of Miss Dale while I am here?"

"Has there been a quarrel?"

"No; there has been no quarrel. I cannot explain to you now why I make this request; but to
you I will explain it before I go."

"Explain it to me!"

"I have regarded you as more than an acquaintance,--as a friend. In days now past there were
moments when I was almost rash enough to hope that I might have said even more than that. I
confess that I had no warrant for such hopes, but I believe that I may still look on you as
a friend?"

"Oh, yes, certainly," said Alexandrina, in a very low voice, and with a certain amount of tenderness
in her tone. "I have always regarded you as a friend."

"And therefore I venture to make the request. The subject is not one on which I can speak openly,
without regret, at the present moment. But to you, at least, I promise that I will explain
it all before I leave Courcy."

He at any rate succeeded in mystifying Lady Alexandrina. "I don't believe he is engaged a bit,"
she said to Lady Amelia Gazebee that night.

"Nonsense, my dear. Lady Julia wouldn't speak of it in that certain way if she didn't know.
Of course he doesn't wish to have it talked about."

"If ever he has been engaged to her, he has broken it off again," said Lady Alexandrina.

"I dare say he will, my dear, if you give him encouragement," said the married sister, with
great sisterly good-nature.

CHAPTER XVIII

Lily Dale's First Love-Letter

Crosbie was rather proud of himself when he went to bed. He had succeeded in baffling the charge
made against him, without saying anything as to which his conscience need condemn him. So,
at least, he then told himself. The impression left by what he had said would be that there
had been some question of an engagement between him and Lilian Dale, but that nothing at this
moment was absolutely fixed. But in the morning his conscience was not quite so clear. What
would Lily think and say if she knew it all? Could he dare to tell her, or to tell any one
the real state of his mind?

As he lay in bed, knowing that an hour remained to him before he need encounter the perils
of his tub, he felt that he hated Courcy Castle and its inmates. Who was there, among them
all, that was comparable to Mrs Dale and her daughters? He detested both George and John. He
loathed the earl. As to the countess herself, he was perfectly indifferent, regarding her as
a woman whom it was well to know, but as one only to be known as the mistress of Courcy Castle
and a house in London. As to the daughters, he had ridiculed them all from time to time--even
Alexandrina, whom he now professed to love. Perhaps in some sort of way he had a weak fondness
for her;--but it was a fondness that had never touched his heart. He could measure the whole
thing at its worth,--Courcy Castle with its privileges, Lady Dumbello, Lady Clandidlem, and
the whole of it. He knew that he had been happier on that lawn at Allington, and more contented
with himself, than ever he had been even under Lady Hartletop's splendid roof in Shropshire.
Lady Dumbello was satisfied with these things, even in the inmost recesses of her soul; but
he was not a male Lady Dumbello. He knew that there was something better, and that that something
was within his reach.

But, nevertheless, the air of Courcy was too much for him. In arguing the matter with himself
he regarded himself as one infected with a leprosy from which there could be no recovery, and
who should, therefore, make his whole life suitable to the circumstances of that leprosy. It
was of no use for him to tell himself that the Small House at Allington was better than Courcy
Castle. Satan knew that heaven was better than hell; but he felt himself to be fitter for the
latter place. Crosbie ridiculed Lady Dumbello, even there among her friends, with all the cutting
words that his wit could find; but, nevertheless, the privilege of staying in the same house
with her was dear to him. It was the line of life into which he had fallen, and he confessed
inwardly that the struggle to extricate himself would be too much for him. All that had troubled
him while he was yet at Allington, but it overwhelmed him almost with dismay beneath the hangings
of Courcy Castle.

Had he not better run from the place at once? He had almost acknowledged to himself that he
repented his engagement with Lilian Dale, but he still was resolved that he would fulfil it.
He was bound in honour to marry "that little girl," and he looked sternly up at the drapery
over his head, as he assured himself that he was a man of honour. Yes; he would sacrifice himself.
As he had been induced to pledge his word, he would not go back from it. He was too much of
a man for that!

But had he not been wrong to refuse the result of Lily's wisdom when she told him in the field
that it would be better for them to part? He did not tell himself that he had refused her offer
merely because he had not the courage to accept it on the spur of the moment. No. "He had been
too good to the poor girl to take her at her word." It was thus he argued on the matter within
his own breast. He had been too true to her; and now the effect would be that they would both
be unhappy for life! He could not live in content with a family upon a small income. He was
well aware of that. No one could be harder upon him in that matter than was he himself. But
it was too late now to remedy the ill effects of an early education.

It was thus that he debated the matter as he lay in bed, contradicting one argument by another
over and over again; but still in all of them teaching himself to think that this engagement
of his was a misfortune. Poor Lily! Her last words to him had conveyed an assurance that she
would never distrust him. And she also, as she lay wakeful in her bed on this the first morning
of his absence, thought much of their mutual vows. How true she would be to them! How she would
be his wife with all her heart and spirit! It was not only that she would love him;--but in
her love she would serve him to her utmost; serve him as regarded this world, and if possible
as regarded the next.

"Bell," she said, "I wish you were going to be married too."

"Thank'ye, dear," said Bell, "Perhaps I shall some day."

"Ah; but I'm not joking. It seems such a serious thing. And I can't expect you to talk to me
about it now as you would if you were in the same position yourself. Do you think I shall make
him happy?"

"Yes, I do, certainly."

"Happier than he would be with any one else that he might meet? I dare not think that. I think
I could give him up to-morrow, if I could see any one that would suit him better." What would
Lily have said had she been made acquainted with all the fascinations of Lady Alexandrina de
Courcy?

The countess was very civil to him, saying nothing about his engagement, but still talking
to him a good deal about his sojourn at Allington. Crosbie was a pleasant man for ladies in
a large house. Though a sportsman, he was not so keen a sportsman as to be always out with
the gamekeepers. Though a politician, he did not sacrifice his mornings to the perusal of blue-books
or the preparation of party tactics. Though a reading man, he did not devote himself to study.
Though a horseman, he was not often to be found in the stables. He could supply conversation
when it was wanted, and could take himself out of the way when his presence among the women
was not needed. Between breakfast and lunch on the day following his arrival he talked a good
deal to the countess, and made himself very agreeable. She continued to ridicule him gently
for his prolonged stay among so primitive and rural a tribe of people as the Dales, and he
bore her little sarcasm with the utmost good-humour.

"Six weeks at Allington without a move! Why, Mr Crosbie, you must have felt yourself to be
growing there."

"So I did--like an ancient tree. Indeed, I was so rooted that I could hardly get away."

"Was the house full of people all the time?"

"There was nobody there but Bernard Dale, Lady Julia's nephew."

"Quite a case of Damon and Pythias. Fancy your going down to the shades of Allington to enjoy
the uninterrupted pleasures of friendship for six weeks."

"Friendship and the partridges."

"There was nothing else, then?"

"Indeed there was. There was a widow with two very nice daughters, living, not exactly in the
same house, but on the same grounds."

"Oh, indeed. That makes such a difference; doesn't it? You are not a man to bear much privation
on the score of partridges, nor a great deal, I imagine, for friendship. But when you talk
of pretty girls--"

"It makes a difference, doesn't it?"

"A very great difference. I think I have heard of that Mrs Dale before. And so her girls are nice?"

"Very nice indeed."

"Play croquet, I suppose, and eat syllabub on the lawn? But, really, didn't you get very tired
of it?"

"Oh dear, no. I was happy as the day was long."

"Going about with a crook, I suppose?"

"Not exactly a live crook; but doing all that kind of thing. I learned a great deal about pigs."

"Under the guidance of Miss Dale?"

"Yes; under the guidance of Miss Dale."

"I'm sure one is very much obliged to you for tearing yourself away from such charms, and coming
to such unromantic people as we are. But I fancy men always do that sort of thing once or twice
in their lives,--and then they talk of their souvenirs. I suppose it won't go beyond a souvenir
with you."

This was a direct question, but still admitted of a fencing answer. "It has, at any rate, given
me one," said he, "which will last me my life!"

The countess was quite contented. That Lady Julia's statement was altogether true she had never
for a moment doubted. That Crosbie should become engaged to a young lady in the country, whereas
he had shown signs of being in love with her daughter in London, was not at all wonderful.
Nor, in her eyes, did such practice amount to any great sin. Men did so daily, and girls were
prepared for their so doing. A man in her eyes was not to be regarded as safe from attack because
he was engaged. Let the young lady who took upon herself to own him have an eye to that. When
she looked back on the past careers of her own flock, she had to reckon more than one such
disappointment for her own daughters. Others besides Alexandrina had been so treated. Lady
de Courcy had had her grand hopes respecting her girls, and after them moderate hopes, and
again after them bitter disappointments. Only one had been married, and she was married to
an attorney. It was not to be supposed that she would have any very high-toned feelings as
to Lily's rights in this matter.

Such a man as Crosbie was certainly no great match for an earl's daughter. Such a marriage,
indeed, would, one may say, be but a poor triumph. When the countess, during the last season
in town, had observed how matters were going with Alexandrina, she had cautioned her child,
taking her to task for her imprudence. But the child had been at this work for fourteen years,
and was weary of it. Her sisters had been at the work longer, and had almost given it up in
despair. Alexandrina did not tell her parent that her heart was now beyond her control, and
that she had devoted herself to Crosbie for ever; but she pouted, saying that she knew very
well what she was about, scolding her mother in return, and making Lady de Courcy perceive
that the struggle was becoming very weary. And then there were other considerations. Mr Crosbie
had not much certainly in his own possession, but he was a man out of whom something might
be made by family influence and his own standing. He was not a hopeless, ponderous man, whom
no leaven could raise. He was one of whose position in society the countess and her daughters
need not be ashamed. Lady de Courcy had given no expressed consent to the arrangement, but
it had come to be understood between her and her daughter that the scheme was to be entertained
as admissible.

Then came these tidings of the little girl down at Allington. She felt no anger against Crosbie.
To be angry on such a subject would be futile, foolish, and almost indecorous. It was a part
of the game which was as natural to her as fielding is to a cricketer. One cannot have it all
winnings at any game. Whether Crosbie should eventually become her own son-in-law or not it
came to her naturally, as a part of her duty in life, to howl down the stumps of that young
lady at Allington. If Miss Dale knew the game well and could protect her own wicket, let her do so.

She had no doubt as to Crosbie's engagement with Lilian Dale, but she had as little as to his
being ashamed of that engagement. Had he really cared for Miss Dale he would not have left
her to come to Courcy Castle. Had he been really resolved to marry her, he would not have warded
all questions respecting his engagement with fictitious answers. He had amused himself with
Lily Dale, and it was to be hoped that the young lady had not thought very seriously about
it. That was the most charitable light in which Lady de Courcy was disposed to regard the question.

It behoved Crosbie to write to Lily Dale before dinner. He had promised to do so immediately
on his arrival, and he was aware that he would be regarded as being already one day beyond
his promise. Lily had told him that she would live upon his letters, and it was absolutely
necessary that he should furnish her with her first meal. So he betook himself to his room
in sufficient time before dinner, and got out his pen, ink, and paper.

He got out his pen, ink, and paper, and then he found that his difficulties were beginning.
I beg that it may be understood that Crosbie was not altogether a villain. He could not sit
down and write a letter as coming from his heart, of which as he wrote it he knew the words
to be false. He was an ungenerous, worldly, inconstant man, very prone to think well of himself,
and to give himself credit for virtues which he did not possess; but he could not be false
with premeditated cruelty to a woman he had sworn to love. He could not write an affectionate,
warm-hearted letter to Lily, without bringing himself, at any rate for the time, to feel towards
her in an affectionate, warm-hearted way. Therefore he now sat himself to work, while his pen
yet remained dry in his hand, to remodel his thoughts, which had been turned against Lily and
Allington by the craft of Lady de Courcy. It takes some time before a man can do this. He has
to struggle with himself in a very uncomfortable way, making efforts which are often unsuccessful.
It is sometimes easier to lift a couple of hundredweights than to raise a few thoughts in one's
mind which at other moments will come galloping in without a whistle.

He had just written the date of his letter when a little tap came at his door, and it was opened.

"I say, Crosbie," said the Honourable John, "didn't you say something yesterday about a cigar
before dinner?"

"Not a word," said Crosbie, in rather an angry tone.

"Then it must have been me," said John. "But bring your case with you, and come down to the
harness-room, if you won't smoke here. I've had a regular little snuggery fitted up there;
and we can go in and see the fellows making up the horses."

Crosbie wished the Honourable John at the mischief.

"I have letters to write," said he. "Besides, I never smoke before dinner."

"That's nonsense. I've smoked hundreds of cigars with you before dinner. Are you going to turn
curmudgeon, too, like George and the rest of them? I don't know what's coming to the world!
I suppose the fact is, that little girl at Allington won't let you smoke."

"The little girl at Allington--" began Crosbie; and then he reflected that it would not be
well for him to say anything to his present companion about that little girl. "I'll tell you
what it is," said he. "I really have got letters to write which must go by this post. There's
my cigar-case on the dressing-table."

"I hope it will be long before I'm brought to such a state," said John, taking up the cigars
in his hand.

"Let me have the case back," said Crosbie.

"A present from the little girl, I suppose?" said John. "All right, old fellow! you shall have it."

"There would be a nice brother-in-law for a man," said Crosbie to himself, as the door closed
behind the retreating scion of the de Courcy family. And then, again, he took up his pen. The
letter must be written, and therefore he threw himself upon the table, resolved that the words
should come and the paper be filled.

   COURCY CASTLE, October, 186--.

   DEAREST LILY,--

   This is the first letter I ever wrote to you, except those
   little notes when I sent you my compliments discreetly,
   --and it sounds so odd. You will think that this does not
   come as soon as it should; but the truth is that after all
   I only got in here just before dinner yesterday. I stayed
   ever so long at Barchester, and came across such a queer
   character. For you must know I went to church, and
   afterwards fraternised with the clergyman who did the
   service; such a gentle old soul,--and, singularly enough,
   he is the grandfather of Lady Dumbello, who is staying
   here. I wonder what you'd think of Lady Dumbello, or how
   you'd like to be shut up in the same house with her for a
   week?

   But with reference to my staying at Barchester, I must tell
   you the truth now, though I was a gross impostor the day
   that I went away. I wanted to avoid a parting on that last
   morning, and therefore I started much sooner than I need
   have done. I know you will be very angry with me; but open
   confession is good for the soul. You frustrated all my
   little plan by your early rising; and as I saw you standing
   on the terrace, looking after us as we went, I acknowledged
   that you had been right, and that I was wrong. When the
   time came, I was very glad to have you with me at the last
   moment.

   My own dearest Lily, you cannot think how different this
   place is from the two houses at Allington, or how much I
   prefer the sort of life which belongs to the latter. I know
   that I have been what the world calls worldly, but you will
   have to cure me of that. I have questioned myself very much
   since I left you, and I do not think that I am quite
   beyond the reach of a cure. At any rate, I will put myself
   trustingly into the doctor's hands. I know it is hard for a
   man to change his habits; but I can with truth say this for
   myself, that I was happy at Allington, enjoying every hour
   of the day, and that here I am ennuyé by everybody and
   nearly by everything. One of the girls of the house I do
   like; but as to other people, I can hardly find a companion
   among them, let alone a friend. However, it would not have
   done for me to have broken away from all such alliance too
   suddenly.

   When I get up to London--and now I really am anxious to get
   there--I can write to you more at my ease, and more freely
   than I do here. I know that I am hardly myself among these
   people,--or rather, I am hardly myself as you know me, and
   as I hope you always will know me. But, nevertheless, I am
   not so overcome by the miasma but what I can tell you how
   truly I love you. Even though my spirit should be here,
   which it is not, my heart would be on the Allington lawns.
   That dear lawn and that dear bridge!

   Give my kind love to Bell and your mother. I feel already
   that I might almost say my mother. And Lily, my darling,
   write to me at once. I expect your letters to me to be
   longer, and better, and brighter than mine to you. But I
   will endeavour to make mine nicer when I get back to town.

   God bless you. Yours, with all my heart,

   A. C.

As he waxed warm with his writing he had forced himself to be affectionate, and, as he flattered
himself, frank and candid. Nevertheless, he was partly conscious that he was preparing for
himself a mode of escape in those allusions of his to his own worldliness; if escape should
ultimately be necessary. "I have tried," he would then say; "I have struggled honestly, with
my best efforts for success; but I am not good enough for such success." I do not intend to
say that he wrote with a premeditated intention of thus using his words; but as he wrote them
he could not keep himself from reflecting that they might be used in that way.

He read his letter over, felt satisfied with it, and resolved that he might now free his mind
from that consideration for the next forty-eight hours. Whatever might be his sins he had done
his duty by Lily! And with this comfortable reflection he deposited his letter in the Courcy
Castle letter-box.

CHAPTER XIX

The Squire Makes a Visit to the Small House

Mrs Dale acknowledged to herself that she had not much ground for hoping that she should ever
find in Crosbie's house much personal happiness for her future life. She did not dislike Mr
Crosbie, nor in any great degree mistrust him; but she had seen enough of him to make her certain
that Lily's future home in London could not be a home for her. He was worldly, or, at least,
a man of the world. He would be anxious to make the most of his income, and his life would
be one long struggle, not perhaps for money, but for those things which money only can give.
There are men to whom eight hundred a year is great wealth, and houses to which it brings all
the comforts that life requires. But Crosbie was not such a man, nor would his house be such
a house. Mrs Dale hoped that Lily would be happy with him, and satisfied with his modes of
life, and she strove to believe that such would be the case; but as regarded herself she was
forced to confess that in such a marriage her child would be much divided from her. That pleasant
abode to which she had long looked forward that she might have a welcome there in coming years
should be among fields and trees, not in some narrow London street. Lily must now become a
city lady; but Bell would still be left to her, and it might still be hoped that Bell would
find for herself some country home.

Since the day on which Lily had first told her mother of her engagement, Mrs Dale had found
herself talking much more fully and more frequently with Bell than with her younger daughter.
As long as Crosbie was at Allington this was natural enough. He and Lily were of course together,
while Bell remained with her mother. But the same state of things continued even after Crosbie
was gone. It was not that there was any coolness or want of affection between the mother and
daughter, but that Lily's heart was full of her lover, and that Mrs Dale, though she had given
her cordial consent to the marriage, felt that she had but few points of sympathy with her
future son-in-law. She had never said, even to herself, that she disliked him; nay, she had
sometimes declared to herself that she was fond of him. But, in truth, he was not a man after
her own heart. He was not one who could ever be to her as her own son and her own child.

But she and Bell would pass hours together talking of Lily's prospects. "It seems strange to
me," said Mrs Dale, "that she of all girls should have been fancied by such a man as Mr Crosbie,
or that she should have liked him. I cannot imagine Lily living in London."

"If he is good and affectionate to her she will be happy wherever he is," said Bell.

"I hope so;--I'm sure I hope so. But it seems as though she will be so far separated from us.
It is not the distance, but the manner of life which makes the separation. I hope you'll never
be taken so far from me."

"I don't think I shall allow myself to be taken up to London," said Bell, laughing. "But one
can never tell. If I do you must follow us, mamma."

"I do not want another Mr Crosbie for you, dear."

"But perhaps I may want one for myself. You need not tremble quite yet, however. Apollos do
not come this road every day."

"Poor Lily! Do you remember when she first called him Apollo? I do, well. I remember his coming
here the day after Bernard brought him down, and how you were playing on the lawn, while I
was in the other garden. I little thought then what it would come to."

"But, mamma, you don't regret it?"

"Not if it's to make her happy. If she can be happy with him, of course I shall not regret
it; not though he were to take her to the world's end away from us. What else have I to look
for but that she and you should both be happy?"

"Men in London are happy with their wives as well as men in the country."

"Oh, yes; of all women I should be the first to acknowledge that."

"And as to Adolphus himself, I do not know why we should distrust him."

"No, my dear; there is no reason. If I did distrust him I should not have given so ready an
assent to the marriage. But, nevertheless--"

"The truth is, you don't like him, mamma."

"Not so cordially as I hope I may like any man whom you may choose for your husband."

And Lily, though she said nothing on the subject to Mrs Dale, felt that her mother was in some
degree estranged from her. Crosbie's name was frequently mentioned between them, but in the
tone of Mrs Dale's voice, and in her manner when she spoke of him, there was lacking that enthusiasm
and heartiness which real sympathy would have produced. Lily did not analyse her own feelings,
or closely make inquiry as to those of her mother, but she perceived that it was not all as
she would have wished it to have been. "I know mamma does not love him," she said to Bell on
the evening of the day on which she received Crosbie's first letter.

"Not as you do, Lily; but she does love him."

"Not as I do! To say that is nonsense, Bell; of course she does not love him as I do. But the
truth is she does not love him at all. Do you think I cannot see it?"

"I'm afraid that you see too much."

"She never says a word against him; but if she really liked him she would sometimes say a word
in his favour. I do not think she would ever mention his name unless you or I spoke of him
before her. If she did not approve of him, why did she not say so sooner?"

"That's hardly fair upon mamma," said Bell, with some earnestness. "She does not disapprove
of him, and she never did. You know mamma well enough to be sure that she would not interfere
with us in such a matter without very strong reason. As regards Mr Crosbie, she gave her consent
without a moment's hesitation."

"Yes, she did."

"How can you say, then, that she disapproves of him?"

"I didn't mean to find fault with mamma. Perhaps it will come all right."

"It will come all right." When the Alcazar of Louis was building for Versailles xiv. at miss

Whilst engineering with how him, if it remarked that one of this windowpane was out of shape,

Louis xiv. having had it is measured, and finding the he had accompany
justly, gone Louvois in a sovereign before his whole.
 It was
now the middle of October, and the fire was lit in Mrs Dale's drawing-room. The window which
opened upon the lawn was closed, the heavy curtains had been put back in their places, and
it had been acknowledged as an unwelcome fact that the last of the summer was over. This was
always a sorrow to Mrs Dale; but it is one of those sorrows which hardly admit of open expression.

"Bell," she said, looking up suddenly; "there's your uncle at the window. Let him in." For
now, since the putting up of the curtains, the window had been bolted as well as closed. So
Bell got up, and opened a passage for the squire's entrance. It was not often that he came
down in this way, and when he did do so it was generally for some purpose which had been expressed
before.

"What! fires already?" said he. "I never have fires at the other house in the morning till
the first of November. I like to see a spark in the grate after dinner."

"I like a fire when I'm cold," said Mrs Dale. But this was a subject on which the squire and
his sister-in-law had differed before, and as Mr Dale had some business in hand, he did not
now choose to waste his energy in supporting his own views on the question of fires.

"Bell, my dear," said he, "I want to speak to your mother for a minute or two on a matter of
business. You wouldn't mind leaving us for a little while, would you?" Whereupon Bell collected
up her work and went upstairs to her sister. "Uncle Christopher is below with mamma," said
she, "talking about business. I suppose it is something to do with your marriage." But Bell
was wrong. The squire's visit had no reference to Lily's marriage.

Mrs Dale did not move or speak a word when Bell was gone, though it was evident that the squire
paused in order that she might ask some question of him. "Mary," said he, at last, "I'll tell
you what it is that I have come to say to you." Whereupon she put the piece of needlework which
was in her hands down upon the work-basket before her, and settled herself to listen to him.

"I wish to speak to you about Bell."

"About Bell?" said Mrs Dale, as though much surprised that he should have anything to say to
her respecting her eldest daughter.

"Yes, about Bell. Here's Lily going to be married, and it will be well that Bell should be
married too."

"I don't see that at all," said Mrs Dale. "I am by no means in a hurry to be rid of her."

"No, I dare say not. But, of course, you only regard her welfare, and I can truly say that
I do the same. There would be no necessity for hurry as to a marriage for her under ordinary
circumstances, but there may be circumstances to make such a thing desirable, and I think that
there are." It was evident from the squire's tone and manner that he was very much in earnest;
but it was also evident that he found some difficulty in opening out the budget with which
he had prepared himself. He hesitated a little in his voice, and seemed to be almost nervous.
Mrs Dale, with some little spice of ill-nature, altogether abstained from assisting him. She
was jealous of interference from him about her girls, and though she was of course bound to
listen to him, she did so with a prejudice against and almost with a resolve to oppose anything
that he might say. When he had finished his little speech about circumstances, the squire paused
again; but Mrs Dale still sat silent, with her eyes fixed upon his face.

"I love your children very dearly;" said he, "though I believe you hardly give me credit for
doing so."

"I am sure you do," said Mrs Dale, "and they are both well aware of it."

"And I am very anxious that they should be comfortably established in life. I have no children
of my own, and those of my two brothers are everything to me."

Mrs Dale had always considered it as a matter of course that Bernard should be the squire's
heir, and had never felt that her daughters had any claim on that score. It was a well-understood
thing in the family that the senior male Dale should have all the Dale property and all the
Dale money. She fully recognised even the propriety of such an arrangement. But it seemed to
her that the squire was almost guilty of hypocrisy in naming his nephew and his two nieces
together, as though they were the joint heirs of his love. Bernard was his adopted son, and
no one had begrudged to the uncle the right of making such adoption. Bernard was everything
to him, and as being his heir was bound to obey him in many things. But her daughters were
no more to him than any nieces might be to any uncle. He had nothing to do with their disposal
in marriage; and the mother's spirit was already up in arms and prepared to do battle for her
own independence, and for that of her children. "If Bernard would marry well," said she, "I
have no doubt it would be a comfort to you,"--meaning to imply thereby that the squire had
no right to trouble himself about any other marriage.

"That's just it," said the squire. "It would be a great comfort to me. And if he and Bell could
make up their minds together, it would, I should think, be a great comfort to you also."

"Bernard and Bell!" exclaimed Mrs Dale. No idea of such a union had ever yet come upon her,
and now in her surprise she sat silent. She had always liked Bernard Dale, having felt for
him more family affection than for any other of the Dale family beyond her own hearth. He had
been very intimate in her house, having made himself almost as a brother to her girls. But
she had never thought of him as a husband for either of them.

"Then Bell has not spoken to you about it," said the squire.

"Never a word."

"And you had never thought about it?"

"Certainly not."

"I have thought about it a great deal. For some years I have always been thinking of it. I
have set my heart upon it, and shall be very unhappy if it cannot be brought about. They are
both very dear to me,--dearer than anybody else. If I could see them man and wife, I should
not much care then how soon I left the old place to them."

There was a purer touch of feeling in this than the squire had ever before shown in his sister-in-law's
presence, and more heartiness than she had given him the credit of possessing. And she could
not but acknowledge to herself that her own child was included in this unexpected warmth of
love, and that she was bound at any rate to entertain some gratitude for such kindness.

"It is good of you to think of her," said the mother; "very good."

"I think a great deal about her," said the squire. "But that does not much matter now. The
fact is, that she has declined Bernard's offer."

"Has Bernard offered to her?"

"So he tells me; and she has refused him. It may perhaps be natural that she should do so,
never having taught herself to look at him in the light of a lover. I don't blame her at all.
I am not angry with her."

"Angry with her! No. You can hardly be angry with her for not being in love with her cousin."

"I say that I am not angry with her. But I think she might undertake to consider the question.
You would like such a match, would you not?"

Mrs Dale did not at first make any answer, but began to revolve the thing in her mind, and
to look at it in various points of view. There was a great deal in such an arrangement which
at the first sight recommended it to her very strongly. All the local circumstances were in
its favour. As regarded herself it would promise to her all that she had ever desired. It would
give her a prospect of seeing very much of Lily; for if Bell were settled at the old family
house, Crosbie would naturally be much with his friend. She liked Bernard also; and for a moment
or two fancied, as she turned it all over in her mind, that, even yet, if such a marriage were
to take place, there might grow up something like true regard between her and the old squire.
How happy would be her old age in that Small House, if Bell with her children were living so
close to her!

"Well?" said the squire, who was looking very intently into her face.

"I was thinking," said Mrs Dale. "Do you say that she has already refused him?"

"I am afraid she has; but then you know--"

"It must of course be left for her to judge."

"If you mean that she cannot be made to marry her cousin, of course we all know she can't."

"I mean rather more than that."

"What do you mean, then?"

"That the matter must be left altogether to her own decision; that no persuasion must be used
by you or me. If he can persuade her, indeed--"

"Yes, exactly. He must persuade her. I quite agree with you that he should have liberty to
plead his own cause. But look you here, Mary;--she has always been a very good child to you--"

"Indeed she has."

"And a word from you would go a long way with her,--as it ought. If she knows that you would
like her to marry her cousin, it will make her think it her duty--"

"Ah! but that is just what I cannot try to make her think."

"Will you let me speak, Mary? You take me up and scold me before the words are half out of
my mouth. Of course I know that in these days a young lady is not to be compelled into marrying
anybody;--not but that, as far as I can see, they did better than they do now when they had
not quite so much of their own way."

"I never would take upon myself to ask a child to marry any man."

"But you may explain to her that it is her duty to give such a proposal much thought before
it is absolutely refused. A girl either is in love or she is not. If she is, she is ready to
jump down a man's throat; and that was the case with Lily."

"She never thought of the man till he had proposed to her fully."

"Well, never mind now. But if a girl is not in love, she thinks she is bound to swear and declare
that she never will be so."

"I don't think Bell ever declared anything of the kind."

"Yes, she did. She told Bernard that she didn't love him and couldn't love him,--and, in fact,
that she wouldn't think anything more about it. Now, Mary, that's what I call being headstrong
and positive. I don't want to drive her, and I don't want you to drive her. But here is an
arrangement which for her will be a very good one; you must admit that. We all know that she
is on excellent terms with Bernard. It isn't as though they had been falling out and hating
each other all their lives. She told him that she was very fond of him, and talked nonsense
about being his sister, and all that."

"I don't see that it was nonsense at all."

"Yes, it was nonsense,--on such an occasion. If a man asks a girl to marry him, he doesn't
want her to talk to him about being his sister. I think it is nonsense. If she would only consider
about it properly she would soon learn to love him."

"That lesson, if it be learned at all, must be learned without any tutor."

"You won't do anything to help me then?"

"I will, at any rate, do nothing to mar you. And, to tell the truth, I must think over the
matter fully before I can decide what I had better say to Bell about it. From her not speaking
to me--"

"I think she ought to have told you."

"No, Mr Dale. Had she accepted him, of course she would have told me. Had she thought of doing
so she might probably have consulted me. But if she made up her mind that she must reject him--"

"She oughtn't to have made up her mind."

"But if she did, it seems natural to me that she should speak of it to no one. She might probably
think that Bernard would be as well pleased that it should not be known."

"Psha,--known!--of course it will be known. Being, everything will he was away state the room was

 And then, as regarded Mrs Dale herself, there
would be nothing in such a marriage which would not be delightful to her. It would give a realisation
to all her dreams of future happiness.

But, as she said to herself over and over again, all that must go for nothing. It must be for
Bell, and for her only, to answer Bernard's question. In her mind there was something sacred
in that idea of love. She would regard her daughter almost as a castaway if she were to marry
any man without absolutely loving him,--loving him as Lily loved her lover, with all her heart
and all her strength.

With such a conviction as this strong upon her, she felt that she could not say much to Bell
that would be of any service.

CHAPTER XX

Dr Crofts

If there was anything in the world as to which Isabella Dale was quite certain, it was this--that
she was not in love with Dr Crofts. As to being in love with her cousin Bernard, she had never
had occasion to ask herself any question on that head. She liked him very well, but she had
never thought of marrying him; and now, when he made his proposal, she could not bring herself
to think of it. But as regards Dr Crofts, she had thought of it, and had make up her mind--in
the manner above described.

It may be said that she could not have been justified in discussing the matter even within
her own bosom, unless authorised to do so by Dr Crofts himself. Let it then be considered that
Dr Crofts had given her some such authority. This may be done in more ways than one; and Miss
Dale could not have found herself asking herself questions about him, unless there had been
fitting occasion for her to do so.

The profession of a medical man in a small provincial town is not often one which gives to
its owner in early life a large income. Perhaps in no career has a man to work harder for what
he earns, or to do more work without earning anything. It has sometimes seemed to me as though
the young doctors and the old doctors had agreed to divide between them the different results
of their profession,--the young doctors doing all the work and the old doctors taking all the
money. If this be so it may account for that appearance of premature gravity which is borne
by so many of the medical profession. Under such an arrangement a man may be excused for a
desire to put away childish things very early in life.

Dr Crofts had now been practising in Guestwick nearly seven years, having settled himself in
that town when he was twenty-three years old, and being at this period about thirty. During
those seven years his skill and industry had been so fully admitted that he had succeeded in
obtaining the medical care of all the paupers in the union, for which work he was paid at the
rate of one hundred pounds a year. He was also assistant-surgeon at a small hospital which
was maintained in that town, and held two or three other similar public positions, all of which
attested his respectability and general proficiency. They, moreover, thoroughly saved him from
any of the dangers of idleness; but, unfortunately, they did not enable him to regard himself
as a successful professional man. Whereas old Dr Gruffen, of whom but few people spoke well,
had made a fortune in Guestwick, and even still drew from the ailments of the town a considerable
and hardly yet decreasing income. Now this was hard upon Dr Crofts--unless there was existing
some such well-understood arrangement as that above named.

He had been known to the family of the Dales long previous to his settlement at Guestwick,
and had been very intimate with them from that time to the present day. Of all the men, young
or old, whom Mrs Dale counted among her intimate friends, he was the one whom she most trusted
and admired. And he was a man to be trusted by those who knew him well. He was not bright and
always ready, as was Crosbie, nor had he all the practical worldly good sense of Bernard Dale.
In mental power I doubt whether he was superior to John Eames;--to John Eames, such as he might
become when the period of his hobbledehoyhood should have altogether passed away. But Crofts,
compared with the other three, as they all were at present, was a man more to be trusted than
any of them. And there was, moreover, about him an occasional dash of humour, without which
Mrs Dale would hardly have regarded him with that thorough liking which she had for him. But
it was a quiet humour, apt to show itself when he had but one friend with him, rather than
in general society. Crosbie, on the other hand, would be much more bright among a dozen, than
he could with a single companion. Bernard Dale was never bright; and as for Johnny Eames--;
but in this matter of brightness, Johnny Eames had not yet shown to the world what his character
might be.

It was now two years since Crofts had been called upon for medical advice on behalf of his
friend Mrs Dale. She had then been ill for a long period--some two or three months, and Dr
Crofts had been frequent in his visits at Allington. At that time he became very intimate with
Mrs Dale's daughters, and especially so with the eldest. Young unmarried doctors ought perhaps
to be excluded from homes in which there are young ladies. I know, at any rate, that many sage
matrons hold very strongly to that opinion, thinking, no doubt, that doctors ought to get themselves
married before they venture to begin working for a living. Mrs Dale, perhaps, regarded her
own girls as still merely children, for Bell, the elder, was then hardly eighteen; or perhaps
she held imprudent and heterodox opinions on this subject; or it may be that she selfishly
preferred Dr Crofts, with all the danger to her children, to Dr Gruffen, with all the danger
to herself. But the result was that the young doctor one day informed himself, as he was riding
back to Guestwick, that much of his happiness in this world would depend on his being able
to marry Mrs Dale's eldest daughter. At that time his total income amounted to little more
than two hundred a year, and he had resolved within his own mind that Dr Gruffen was esteemed
as much the better doctor by the general public opinion of Guestwick, and that Dr Gruffen's
sandy-haired assistant would even have a better chance of success in the town than himself,
should it ever come to pass that the doctor was esteemed too old for personal practice. Crofts
had no fortune of his own, and he was aware that Miss Dale had none. Then, under those circumstances,
what was he to do?

It is not necessary that we should inquire at any great length into those love passages of
the doctor's life which took place three years before the commencement of this narrative. He
made no declaration to Bell; but Bell, young as she was, understood well that he would fain
have done so, had not his courage failed him, or rather had not his prudence prevented him.
To Mrs Dale he did speak, not openly avowing his love even to her, but hinting at it, and then
talking to her of his unsatisfied hopes and professional disappointments. "It is not that I
complain of being poor as I am," said he, "or at any rate, not so poor that my poverty must
be any source of discomfort to me; but I could hardly marry with such an income as I have at
present."

"But it will increase, will it not?" said Mrs Dale.

"It may some day, when I am becoming an old man," he said. "But of what use will it be to me then?"

Mrs Dale could not tell him that, as far as her voice in the matter went, he was welcome to
woo her daughter and marry her, poor as he was, and doubly poor as they would both be together
on such a pittance. He had not even mentioned Bell's name, and had he done so she could only
have bade him wait and hope. After that he said nothing further to her upon the subject. To
Bell he spoke no word of overt love; but on an autumn day, when Mrs Dale was already convalescent,
and the repetition of his professional visits had become unnecessary, he got her to walk with
him through the half-hidden shrubbery paths, and then told her things which he should never
have told her, if he really wished to bind her heart to his. He repeated that story of his
income, and explained to her that his poverty was only grievous to him in that it prevented
him from thinking of marriage. "I suppose it must," said Bell. "I should think it wrong to
ask any lady to share such an income as mine," said he. Whereupon Bell had suggested to him
that some ladies had incomes of their own, and that he might in that way get over the difficulty.
"I should be afraid of myself in marrying a girl with money," said he; "besides, that is altogether
out of the question now." Of course Bell did not ask him why it was out of the question, and
for a time they went on walking in silence. "It is a hard thing to do," he then said,--not
looking at her, but looking at the gravel on which he stood. "It is a hard thing to do, but
I will determine to think of it no further. I believe a man may be as happy single as he may
married,--almost." "Perhaps more so," said Bell. Then the doctor left her, and Bell, as I have
said before, made up her mind with great firmness that she was not in love with him. I may
certainly say that there was nothing in the world as to which she was so certain as she was
of this.

And now, in these days, Dr Crofts did not come over to Allington very often. Had any of the
family in the Small House been ill, he would have been there of course. The squire himself
employed the apothecary in the village, or if higher aid was needed, would send for Dr Gruffen.
On the occasion of Mrs Dale's party, Crofts was there, having been specially invited; but Mrs
Dale's special invitations to her friends were very few, and the doctor was well aware that
he must himself make occasion for going there if he desired to see the inmates of the house.
But he very rarely made such occasion, perhaps feeling that he was more in his element at the
workhouse and the hospital.

Just at this time, however, he made one very great and unexpected step towards success in his
profession. He was greatly surprised one morning by being summoned to the Manor House to attend
upon Lord De Guest. The family at the Manor had employed Dr Gruffen for the last thirty years,
and Crofts, when he received the earl's message, could hardly believe the words. "The earl
ain't very bad," said the servant, "but he would be glad to see you if possible a little before
dinner."

"You're sure he wants to see me?" said Crofts.

"Oh, yes; I'm sure enough of that, sir."

"It wasn't Dr Gruffen?"

"No, sir; it wasn't Dr Gruffen. I believe his lordship's had about enough of Dr Gruffen. The
doctor took to chaffing his lordship one day."

"Chaffed his lordship;--his hands and feet, and that sort of thing?" suggested the doctor.

"Hands and feet!" said the man. "Lord bless you, sir, he poked his fun at him, just as though
he was nobody. I didn't hear, but Mrs Connor says that my lord's back was up terribly high."
And so Dr Crofts got on his horse and rode up to Guestwick Manor.

The earl was alone, Lady Julia having already gone to Courcy Castle. "How d'ye do, how d'ye
do?" said the earl. "I'm not very ill, but I want to get a little advice from you. It's quite
a trifle, but I thought it well to see somebody." Whereupon Dr Crofts of course declared that
he was happy to wait upon his lordship.

"I know all about you, you know," said the earl. "Your grandmother Stoddard was a very old
friend of my aunt's. You don't remember Lady Jemima?"

"No," said Crofts. "I never had that honour."

"An excellent old woman, and knew your grandmother Stoddard well. You see, Gruffen has been
attending us for I don't know how many years; but upon my word--" and then the earl stopped
himself.

"It's an ill wind that blows nobody any good," said Crofts, with a slight laugh.

"Perhaps it'll blow me some good, for Gruffen never did me any. The fact is this; I'm very
well, you know,--as strong as a horse."

"You look pretty well."

"No man could be better,--not of my age. I'm sixty, you know."

"You don't look as though you were ailing."

"I'm always out in the open air, and that, I take it, is the best thing for a man."

"There's nothing like plenty of exercise, certainly."

"And I'm always taking exercise," said the earl. "There isn't a man about the place works much
harder than I do. And, let me tell you, sir, when you undertake to keep six or seven hundred
acres of land in your own hand, you must look after it, unless you mean to lose money by it."

"I've always heard that your lordship is a good farmer."

"Well, yes; wherever the grass may grow about my place, it doesn't grow under my feet. You
won't often find me in bed at six o'clock, I can tell you."

After this Dr Crofts ventured to ask his lordship as to what special physical deficiency his
own aid was invoked at the present time.

"Ah, I was just coming to that," said the earl. "They tell me it's a very dangerous practice
to go to sleep after dinner."

"It's not very uncommon at any rate," said the doctor.

"I suppose not; but Lady Julia is always at me about it. And, to tell the truth, I think I
sleep almost too sound when I get to my arm-chair in the drawing-room. Sometimes my sister
really can't wake me;--so, at least, she says."

"And how's your appetite at dinner?"

"Oh, I'm quite right there. I never eat any luncheon, you know, and enjoy my dinner thoroughly.
Then I drink three or four glasses of port wine--"

"And feel sleepy afterwards?"

"That's just it," said the earl.

It is not perhaps necessary that we should inquire what was the exact nature of the doctor's
advice; but it was, at any rate, given in such a way that the earl said he would be glad to
see him again.

"And look here, Doctor Crofts, I'm all alone just at present. Suppose you come over and dine
with me to-morrow; then, if I should go to sleep, you know, you'll be able to let me know whether
Lady Julia doesn't exaggerate. Just between ourselves, I don't quite believe all she says about
my--my snoring, you know."

Whether it was that the earl restrained his appetite when at dinner under the doctor's eyes,
or whether the mid-day mutton chop which had been ordered for him had the desired effect, or
whether the doctor's conversation was more lively than that of the Lady Julia, we will not
say; but the earl, on the evening in question, was triumphant. As he sat in his easy-chair
after dinner he hardly winked above once or twice; and when he had taken the large bowl of
tea, which he usually swallowed in a semi-somnolent condition, he was quite lively.

"Ah, yes," he said, jumping up and rubbing his eyes; "I think I do feel lighter. I enjoy a
snooze after dinner; I do indeed; I like it; but then, when one comes to go to bed, one does
it in such a sneaking sort of way, as though one were in disgrace! And my sister, she thinks
it a crime--literally a sin, to go to sleep in a chair. Nobody ever caught her napping! By-the-by,
Dr Crofts, did you know that Mr Crosbie whom Bernard Dale brought down to Allington? Lady Julia
and he are staying at the same house now."

"I met him once at Mrs Dale's."

"Going to marry one of the girls, isn't he?"

Whereupon Dr Crofts explained that Mr Crosbie was engaged to Lilian Dale.

"Ah, yes; a nice girl I'm told. You know all those Dales are connections of ours. My sister
Fanny married their uncle Orlando. My brother-in-law doesn't like travelling, and so I don't
see very much of him; but of course I'm interested about the family."

"They're very old friends of mine," said Crafts.

"Yes, I dare say. There are two girls, are there not?"

"Yes, two."

"And Miss Lily is the youngest. There's nothing about the elder one getting married, is there?"

"I've not heard anything of it."

"A very pretty girl she is, too. I remember seeing her at her uncle's last year. I shouldn't
wonder if she were to marry her cousin Bernard. He is to have the property, you know; and he's
my nephew."

"I'm not quite sure that it's a good thing for cousins to marry," said Crofts.

"They do, you know, very often; and it suits some family arrangements. I suppose Dale must
provide for them, and that would take one off his hands without any trouble."

Dr Crofts didn't exactly see the matter in this light, but he was not anxious to argue it very
closely with the earl. "The younger one," he said, "has provided for herself."

"What; by getting a husband? But I suppose Dale must give her something. They're not married
yet, you know, and, from what I hear, that fellow may prove a slippery customer. He'll not
marry her unless old Dale gives her something. You'll see if he does. I'm told that he has
got another string to his bow at Courcy Castle."

Soon after this, Crofts took his horse and rode home, having promised the earl that he would
dine with him again before long.

"It'll be a great convenience to me if you'd come about that time," said the earl, "and as
you're a bachelor perhaps you won't mind it. You'll come on Thursday at seven, will you? Take
care of yourself. It's as dark as pitch. John, go and open the first gates for Dr Crofts."
And then the earl took himself off to bed.

Crofts, as he rode home, could not keep his mind from thinking of the two girls at Allington.
"He'll not marry her unless old Dale gives her something." Had it come to that with the world,
that a man must be bribed into keeping his engagement with a lady? Was there no romance left
among mankind,--no feeling of chivalry? "He's got another string to his bow at Courcy Castle,"
said the earl; and his lordship seemed to be in no degree shocked as he said it. It was in
this tone that men spoke of women nowadays, and yet he himself had felt such awe of the girl
he loved, and such a fear lest he might injure her in her worldly position, that he had not
dared to tell her that he loved her. She was not quite aware what might be the course of post
between Courcy and Allington, and had not, therefore, felt very grievously disappointed when
the letter did not come on the very first day. She had, however, in the course of the morning,
walked down to the post-office, in order that she might be sure that it was not remaining there.

"Why, miss, they all be delivered; you know that," said Mrs Crump, the post-mistress.

"But one might be left behind, I thought."

"John Postman went up to the house this very day, with a newspaper for your mamma. I can't
make letters for people if folks don't write them."

"But they are left behind sometimes, Mrs Crump. He wouldn't come up with one letter if he'd
got nothing else for anybody in the street."

"Indeed but he would then. I wouldn't let him leave a letter here no how, nor yet a paper.
It's no good you're coming down here for letters, Miss Lily. If he don't write to you, I can't
make him do it." And so poor Lily went home discomforted.

But the letter came on the next morning, and all was right. According to her judgment it lacked
nothing, either in fulness or in affection. When he told her how he had planned his early departure
in order that he might avoid the pain of parting with her on the last moment, she smiled and
pressed the paper, and rejoiced inwardly that she had got the better of him as to that manoeuvre.
And then she kissed the words which told her that he had been glad to have her with him at
the last moment. When he declared that he had been happier at Allington than he was at Courcy,
she believed him thoroughly, and rejoiced that it should be so. And when he accused himself
of being worldly, she excused him, persuading herself that he was nearly perfect in this respect
as in others. Of course a man living in London, and having to earn his bread out in the world,
must be more worldly than a country girl; but the fact of his being able to love such a girl,
to choose such a one for his wife,--was not that alone sufficient proof that the world had
not enslaved him? "My heart is on the Allington lawns," he said; and then, as she read the
words, she kissed the paper again.

In her eyes, and to her ears, and to her heart, the letter was a beautiful letter. I believe
there is no bliss greater than that which a thorough love-letter gives to a girl who knows
that in receiving it she commits no fault,--who can open it before her father and mother with
nothing more than the slight blush which the consciousness of her position gives her. And of
all love-letters the first must be the sweetest! What a value there is in every word! How each
expression is scanned and turned to the best account! With what importance are all those little
phrases invested, which too soon become mere phrases, used as a matter of course. Crosbie had
finished his letter by bidding God bless her; "And you too," said Lily, pressing the letter
to her bosom.

"Does he say anything particular?" asked Mrs Dale.

"Yes, mamma; it's all very particular."

"But there's nothing for the public ear."

"He sends his love to you and Bell."

"We are very much obliged to him."

"So you ought to be. And he says that he went to church going through Barchester, and that
the clergyman was the grandfather of that Lady Dumbello. When he got to Courcy Castle Lady
Dumbello was there."

"What a singular coincidence!" said Mrs Dale.

"I won't tell you a word more about his letter," said Lily. So she folded it up, and put it
in her pocket. But as soon as she found herself alone in her own room, she had it out again,
and read it over some half-a-dozen times.

That was the occupation of her morning,--that, and the manufacture of some very intricate piece
of work which was intended for the adornment of Mr Crosbie's person. Her hands, however, were
very full of work;--or, rather, she intended that they should be full. She would take with
her to her new home, when she was married, all manner of household gear, the produce of her
own industry and economy. She had declared that she wanted to do something for her future husband,
and she would begin that something at once. And in this matter she did not belie her promises
to herself, or allow her good intentions to evaporate unaccomplished. She soon surrounded herself
with harder tasks than those embroidered slippers with which she indulged herself immediately
after his departure. And Mrs Dale and Bell, though in their gentle way they laughed at her,--nevertheless
they worked with her, sitting sternly to their long tasks, in order that Crosbie's house might
not be empty when their darling should go to take her place there as his wife.

But it was absolutely necessary that the letter should be answered. It would in her eyes have
been a great sin to have let that day's post go without carrying a letter from her to Courcy
Castle,--a sin of which she felt no temptation to be guilty. It was an exquisite pleasure to
her to seat herself at her little table, with her neat desk and small appurtenances for epistle-craft,
and to feel that she had a letter to write in which she had truly much to say. Hitherto her
correspondence had been uninteresting and almost weak in its nature. From her mother and sister
she had hardly been yet parted; and though she had other friends, she had seldom found herself
with very much to tell them by post. What could she communicate to Mary Eames at Guestwick,
which should be in itself exciting as she wrote it? When she wrote to John Eames, and told
"Dear John" that mamma hoped to have the pleasure of seeing him to tea at such an hour, the
work of writing was of little moment to her, though the note when written became one of the
choicest treasures of him to whom it was addressed.

But now the matter was very different. When she saw the words "Dearest Adolphus" on the paper
before her, she was startled with their significance. "And four months ago I had never even
heard of him," she said to herself, almost with awe. And now he was more to her, and nearer
to her, than even was her sister or her mother! She recollected how she had laughed at him
behind his back, and called him a swell on the first day of his coming to the Small House,
and how, also, she had striven, in her innocent way, to look her best when called upon to go
out and walk with the stranger from London. He was no longer a stranger now, but her own dearest
friend.

She had put down her pen that she might think of all this--by no means for the first time--and
then resumed it with a sudden start as though fearing that the postman might be in the village
before her letter was finished. "Dearest Adolphus, I need not tell you how delighted I was
when your letter was brought to me this morning." But I will not repeat the whole of her letter
here. She had no incident to relate, none even so interesting as that of Mr Crosbie's encounter
with Mr Harding at Barchester. She had met no Lady Dumbello, and had no counterpart to Lady
Alexandrina, of whom, as a friend, she could say a word in praise. John Eames's name she did
not mention, knowing that John Eames was not a favourite with Mr Crosbie; nor had she anything
to say of John Eames, that had not been already said. He had, indeed, promised to come over
to Allington; but this visit had not been made when Lily wrote her first letter to Crosbie.
It was a sweet, good, honest love-letter, full of assurances of unalterable affection and unlimited
confidence, indulging in a little quiet fun as to the grandees of Courcy Castle, and ending
with a promise that she would be happy and contented if she might receive his letters constantly,
and live with the hope of seeing him at Christmas.

"I am in time, Mrs Crump, am I not?" she said, as she walked into the post-office.

"Of course you be,--for the next half-hour. T' postman he bain't stirred from t' ale'us yet.
Just put it into t' box wull ye?"

"But you won't leave it there?"

"Leave it there! Did you ever hear the like of that? If you're afeared to put it in, you can
take it away; that's all about it, Miss Lily." And then Mrs Crump turned away to her avocations
at the washing-tub. Mrs Crump had a bad temper, but perhaps she had some excuse. A separate
call was made upon her time with reference to almost every letter brought to her office, and
for all this, as she often told her friends in profound disgust, she received as salary no
more than "tuppence farden a day. It don't find me in shoe-leather; no more it don't." As Mrs
Crump was never seen out of her own house, unless it was in church once a month, this latter
assertion about her shoe-leather could hardly have been true.

Lily had received another letter, and had answered it before Eames made his promised visit
to Allington. He, as will be remembered, had also had a correspondence. He had answered Miss
Roper's letter, and had since that been living in fear of two things; in a lesser fear of some
terrible rejoinder from Amelia, and in a greater fear of a more terrible visit from his lady-love.
Were she to swoop down in very truth upon his Guestwick home, and declare herself to his mother
and sister as his affianced bride, what mode of escape would then be left for him? But this
she had not yet done, nor had she even answered his cruel missive.

"What an ass I am to be afraid of her!" he said to himself as he walked along under the elms
of Guestwick manor, which overspread the road to Allington. When he first went over to Allington
after his return home, he had mounted himself on horseback, and had gone forth brilliant with
spurs, and trusting somewhat to the glories of his dress and gloves. But he had then known
nothing of Lily's engagement. Now he was contented to walk; and as he had taken up his slouched
hat and stick in the passage of his mother's house, he had been very indifferent as to his
appearance. He walked quickly along the road, taking for the first three miles the shade of
the Guestwick elms, and keeping his feet on the broad greensward which skirts the outside of
the earl's palings. "What an ass I am to be afraid of her!" And as he swung his big stick in
his hand, striking a tree here and there, and knocking the stones from his path, he began to
question himself in earnest, and to be ashamed of his position in the world. "Nothing on earth
shall make me marry her," he said; "not if they bring a dozen actions against me. She knows
as well as I do, that I have never intended to marry her. It's a cheat from beginning to end.
If she comes down here, I'll tell her so before my mother." But as the vision of her sudden
arrival came before his eyes, he acknowledged to himself that he still held her in great fear.
He had told her that he loved her. He had written as much as that. If taxed with so much, he
must confess his sin.

Then, by degrees, his mind turned away from Amelia Roper to Lily Dale, not giving him a prospect
much more replete with enjoyment than that other one. He had said that he would call at Allington
before he returned to town, and he was now redeeming his promise. But he did not know why he
should go there. He felt that he should sit silent and abashed in Mrs Dale's drawing-room,
confessing by his demeanour that secret which it behoved him now to hide from every one. He
could not talk easily before Lily, nor could he speak to her of the only subject which would
occupy his thoughts when in her presence. If indeed, he might find her alone-- But, perhaps
that might be worse for him than any other condition.

When he was shown into the drawing-room there was nobody there. "They were here a minute ago,
all three," said the servant girl. "If you'll walk down the garden, Mr John, you'll be sure
to find some of 'em." So John Eames, with a little hesitation, walked down the garden.

First of all he went the whole way round the walks, meeting nobody. Then he crossed the lawn,
returning again to the farther end; and there, emerging from the little path which led from
the Great House, he encountered Lily alone. "Oh, John," she said, "how d'ye do? I'm afraid
you did not find anybody in the house. Mamma and Bell are with Hopkins, away in the large kitchen-garden."

"I've just come over," said Eames, "because I promised. I said I'd come before I went back
to London."

"And they'll be very glad to see you, and so am I. Shall we go after them into the other grounds?
But perhaps you walked over and are tired."

"I did walk," said Eames; "not that I am very tired." But in truth he did not wish to go after
Mrs Dale, though he was altogether at a loss as to what he would say to Lily while remaining
with her. He had fancied that he would like to have some opportunity of speaking to her alone
before he went away,--of making some special use of the last interview which he should have
with her before she became a married woman. But now the opportunity was there, and he hardly
dared to avail himself of it.

"You'll stay and dine with us," said Lily.

"No, I'll not do that, for I especially told my mother that I would be back."

"I'm sure it was very good of you to walk so far to see us. If you really are not tired, I
think we will go to mamma, as she would be very sorry to miss you."

This she said, remembering at the moment what had been Crosbie's injunctions to her about John
Eames. But John had resolved that he would say those words which he had come to speak, and
that, as Lily was there with him, he would avail himself of the chance which fortune had given him.

"I don't think I'll go into the squire's garden," he said.

"Uncle Christopher is not there. He is about the farm somewhere."

"If you don't mind, Lily, I think I'll stay here. I suppose they'll be back soon. Of course
I should like to see them before I go away to London. But, Lily, I came over now chiefly to
see you. It was you who asked me to promise."

Had Crosbie been right in those remarks of his? Had she been imprudent in her little endeavour
to be cordially kind to her old friend? "Shall we go into the drawing-room?" she said, feeling
that she would be in some degree safer there than out among the shrubs and paths of the garden.
And I think she was right in this. A man will talk of love out among the lilacs and roses,
who would be stricken dumb by the demure propriety of the four walls of a drawing-room. John
Eames also had some feeling of this kind, for he determined to remain out in the garden, if
he could so manage it.

"I don't want to go in unless you wish it," he said. "Indeed, I'd rather stay here. So, Lily,
you're going to be married?" And thus he rushed at once into the middle of his discourse.

"Yes," said she, "I believe I am."

"I have not told you yet that I congratulate you."

"I have known very well that you did so in your heart. I have always been sure that you wished
me well."

"Indeed I have. And if congratulating a person is hoping that she may always be happy, I do
congratulate you. But, Lily--" And then he paused, abashed by the beauty, purity, and woman's
grace which had forced him to love her.

"I think I understand all that you would say. I do not want ordinary words to tell me that
I am to count you among my best friends."

"No, Lily; you don't understand all that I would say. You have never known how often and how
much I have thought of you; how dearly I have loved you."

"John, you must not talk of that now."

"I cannot go without telling you. When I came over here, and Mrs Dale told me that you were
to be married to that man--"

"You must not speak of Mr Crosbie in that way," she said, turning upon him almost fiercely.

"I did not mean to say anything disrespectful of him to you. I should hate myself if I were
to do so. Of course you like him better than anybody else?"

"I love him better than all the world besides."

"And so do I love you better than all the world besides." And as he spoke he got up from his
seat and stood before her. "I know how poor I am, and unworthy of you; and only that you are
engaged to him, I don't suppose that I should now tell you. Of course you couldn't accept such
a one as me. But I have loved you ever since you remember; and now that you are going to be
his wife, I cannot but tell you that it is so. You will go and live in London; but as to my
seeing you there, it will be impossible. I could not go into that man's house."

"Oh, John."

"No, never; not if you become his wife. I have loved you as well as he does. When Mrs Dale
told me of it, I thought I should have fallen. I went away without seeing you because I was
unable to speak to you. I made a fool of myself, and have been a fool all along. I am foolish
now to tell you this, but I cannot help it."

"You will forget it all when you meet some girl that you can really love."

"And have I not really loved you? Well, never mind. I have said what I came to say, and I will
now go. If it ever happens that we are down in the country together, perhaps I may see you
again; but never in London. Good-bye, Lily." And he put out his hand to her.

"And won't you stay for mamma?" she said.

"No. Give her my love, and to Bell. They understand all about it. They will know why I have
gone. If ever you should want anybody to do anything for you, remember that I will do it, whatever
it is." And as he paced away from her across the lawn, the special deed in her favour to which
his mind was turned,--that one thing which he most longed to do on her behalf,--was an act
of corporal chastisement upon Crosbie. If Crosbie would but ill-treat her,--ill-treat her with
some antenuptial barbarity,--and if only he could be called in to avenge her wrongs! And as
he made his way back along the road towards Guestwick, he built up within his own bosom a castle
in the air, for her part in which Lily Dale would by no means have thanked him.

Lily when she was left alone burst into tears. She had certainly said very little to encourage
her forlorn suitor, and had so borne herself during the interview that even Crosbie could hardly
have been dissatisfied; but now that Eames was gone her heart became very tender towards him.
She felt that she did love him also;--not at all as she loved Crosbie, but still with a love
that was tender, soft, and true. If Crosbie could have known all her thoughts at that moment,
I doubt whether he would have liked them. She burst into tears, and then hurried away into
some nook where she could not be seen by her mother and Bell on their return.

Eames went on his way, walking very quietly, swinging his stick and kicking through the dust,
with his heart full of the scene which had just passed. He was angry with himself, thinking
that he had played his part badly, accusing himself in that he had been rough to her, and selfish
in the expression of his love; and he was angry with her because she had declared to him that
she loved Crosbie better than all the world besides. He knew that of course she must do so;--that
at any rate it was to be expected that such was the case. Yet, he thought, she might have refrained
from saying so to him. "She chooses to scorn me now," he said to himself; "but the time may
come when she will wish that she had scorned him." That Crosbie was wicked, bad, and selfish,
he believed most fully. He felt sure that the man would ill-use her and make her wretched.
He had some slight doubt whether he would marry her, and from this doubt he endeavoured to
draw a scrap of comfort. If Crosbie would desert her, and if to him might be accorded the privilege
of beating the man to death with his fists because of this desertion, then the world would
not be quite blank for him. In all this he was no doubt very cruel to Lily;--but then had not
Lily been very cruel to him?

He was still thinking of these things when he came to the first of the Guestwick pastures.
The boundary of the earl's property was very plainly marked, for with it commenced also the
shady elms along the roadside, and the broad green margin of turf, grateful equally to those
who walked and to those who rode. Eames had got himself on to the grass, but, in the fulness
of his thoughts, was unconscious of the change in his path, when he was startled by a voice
in the next field and the loud bellowing of a bull. Lord De Guest's choice cattle he knew were
there, and there was one special bull which was esteemed by his lordship as of great value,
and regarded as a high favourite. The people about the place declared that the beast was vicious,
but Lord De Guest had often been heard to boast that it was never vicious with him. "The boys
tease him, and the men are almost worse than the boys," said the earl; "but he'll never hurt
any one that has not hurt him." Guided by faith in his own teaching the earl had taught himself
to look upon his bull as a large, horned, innocent lamb of the flock.

As Eames paused on the road, he fancied that he recognised the earl's voice, and it was the
voice of one in distress. Then the bull's roar sounded very plain in his ear, and almost close;
upon hearing which he rushed on to the gate, and, without much thinking what he was doing,
vaulted over it, and advanced a few steps into the field.

"Halloo!" shouted the earl. "There's a man. Come on." And then his continued shoutings hardly
formed themselves into intelligible words; but Eames plainly understood that he was invoking
assistance under great pressure and stress of circumstances. The bull was making short runs
at his owner, as though determined in each run to have a toss at his lordship; and at each
run the earl would retreat quickly for a few paces, but he retreated always facing his enemy,
and as the animal got near to him, would make digs at his face with the long spud which he
carried in his hand. But in thus making good his retreat he had been unable to keep in a direct
line to the gate, and there seemed to be great danger lest the bull should succeed in pressing
him up against the hedge. "Come on!" shouted the earl, who was fighting his battle manfully,
but was by no means anxious to carry off all the laurels of the victory himself. "Come on,
I say!" Then he stopped in his path, shouted into the bull's face, brandished his spud, and
threw about his arms, thinking that he might best dismay the beast by the display of these
warlike gestures.

Johnny Eames ran on gallantly to the peer's assistance, as he would have run to that of any
peasant in the land. He was one to whom I should be perhaps wrong to attribute at this period
of his life the gift of very high courage. He feared many things which no man should fear;
but he did not fear personal mishap or injury to his own skin and bones. When Cradell escaped
out of the house in Burton Crescent, making his way through the passage into the outer air,
he did so because he feared that Lupex would beat him or kick him, or otherwise ill-use him.
John Eames would also have desired to escape under similar circumstances; but he would have
so desired because he could not endure to be looked upon in his difficulties by the people
of the house, and because his imagination would have painted the horrors of a policeman dragging
him off with a black eye and a torn coat. There was no one to see him now, and no policeman
to take offence. Therefore he rushed to the earl's assistance, brandishing his stick, and roaring
in emulation of the bull.

When the animal saw with what unfairness he was treated, and that the number of his foes was
doubled, while no assistance had lent itself on his side, he stood for a while, disgusted by
the injustice of humanity. He stopped, and throwing his head up to the heavens, bellowed out
his complaint. "Don't come close!" said the earl, who was almost out of breath. "Keep a little
apart. Ugh! ugh! whoop, whoop!" And he threw up his arms manfully, jobbing about with his spud,
ever and anon rubbing the perspiration from off his eyebrows with the back of his hand.

As the bull stood pausing, meditating whether under such circumstances flight would not be
preferable to gratified passion, Eames made a rush in at him, attempting to hit him on the
head. The earl, seeing this, advanced a step also, and got his spud almost up to the animal's
eye. But these indignities the beast could not stand. He made a charge, bending his head first
towards John Eames, and then, with that weak vacillation which is as disgraceful in a bull
as in a general, he changed his purpose, and turned his horns upon his other enemy. The consequence
was that his steps carried him in between the two, and that the earl and Eames found themselves
for a while behind his tail.

"Now for the gate," said the earl.

"Slowly does it; slowly does it; don't run!" said Johnny, assuming in the heat of the moment
a tone of counsel which would have been very foreign to him under other circumstances.

The earl was not a whit offended. "All right," said he, taking with a backward motion the direction
of the gate. Then as the bull again faced towards him, he jumped from the ground, labouring
painfully with arms and legs, and ever keeping his spud well advanced against the foe. Eames,
holding his position a little apart from his friend, stooped low and beat the ground with his
stick, and as though defying the creature. The bull felt himself defied, stood still and roared,
and then made another vacillating attack.

"Hold on till we reach the gate," said Eames.

"Ugh! ugh! Whoop! whoop!" shouted the earl. And so gradually they made good their ground.

"Now get over," said Eames, when they had both reached the corner of the field in which the
gate stood.

"And what'll you do?" said the earl.

"I'll go at the hedge to the right." And Johnny as he spoke dashed his stick about, so as to
monopolise, for a moment, the attention of the brute. The earl made a spring at the gate, and
got well on to the upper rung. The bull seeing that his prey was going, made a final rush upon
the earl and struck the timber furiously with his head, knocking his lordship down on the other
side. Lord De Guest was already over, but not off the rail; and thus, though he fell, he fell
in safety on the sward beyond the gate. He fell in safety, but utterly exhausted. Eames, as
he had purposed, made a leap almost sideways at a thick hedge which divided the field from
one of the Guestwick copses. There was a fairly broad ditch, and on the other side a quickset
hedge, which had, however, been weakened and injured by trespassers at this corner, close to
the gate. Eames was young and active and jumped well. He jumped so well that he carried his
body full into the middle of the quickset, and then scrambled through to the other side, not
without much injury to his clothes, and some damage also to his hands and face.

The beast, recovering from his shock against the wooden bars, looked wistfully at his last
retreating enemy, as he still struggled amidst the bushes. He looked at the ditch and at the
broken hedge, but he did not understand how weak were the impediments in his way. He had knocked
his head against the stout timber, which was strong enough to oppose him, but was dismayed
by the brambles which he might have trodden under foot without an effort. How many of us are
like the bull, turning away conquered by opposition which should be as nothing to us, and breaking
our feet, and worse still, our hearts, against rocks of adamant. The bull at last made up his
mind that he did not dare to face the hedge; so he gave one final roar, and then turning himself
round, walked placidly back amidst the herd.

Johnny made his way on to the road by a stile that led out of the copse, and was soon standing
over the earl, while the blood ran down his cheeks from the scratches. One of the legs of his
trousers had been caught by a stake, and was torn from the hip downward, and his hat was left
in the field, the only trophy for the bull. "I hope you're not hurt, my lord," he said.

"Oh dear, no; but I'm terribly out of breath. Why, you're bleeding all over. He didn't get
at you, did he?"

"It's only the thorns in the hedge," said Johnny, passing his hand over his face. "But I've
lost my hat."

"There are plenty more hats," said the earl.

"I think I'll have a try for it," said Johnny, with whom the means of getting hats had not
been so plentiful as with the earl. "He looks quiet now." And he moved towards the gate.

But Lord De Guest jumped upon his feet, and seized the young man by the collar of his coat.
"Go after your hat!" said he. "You must be a fool to think of it. If you're afraid of catching
cold, you shall have mine."

"I'm not the least afraid of catching cold," said Johnny. "Is he often like that, my lord?"
And he made a motion with his head towards the bull.

"The gentlest creature alive; he's like a lamb generally--just like a lamb. Perhaps he saw
my red pocket-handkerchief." And Lord De Guest showed his friend that he carried such an article.
"But where should I have been if you hadn't come up?"

"You'd have got to the gate, my lord."

"Yes; with my feet foremost, and four men carrying me. I'm very thirsty. You don't happen to
carry a flask, do you?"

"No, my lord, I don't."

"Then we'll make the best of our way home, and have a glass of wine there." And on this occasion
his lordship intended that his offer should be accepted.

CHAPTER XXII

Lord De Guest at Home

The earl and John Eames, after their escape from the bull, walked up to the Manor House together.
"You can write a note to your mother, and I'll send it by one of the boys," said the earl.
This was his lordship's answer when Eames declined to dine at the Manor House, because he would
be expected home.

"But I'm so badly off for clothes, my lord," pleaded Johnny. "I tore my trousers in the hedge."

"There will be nobody there beside us two and Dr Crofts. The doctor will forgive you when he
hears the story; and as for me, I didn't care if you hadn't a stitch to your back. You'll have
company back to Guestwick, so come along."

Eames had no further excuse to offer, and therefore did as he was bidden. He was by no means
as much at home with the earl now as during those minutes of the combat. He would rather have
gone home, being somewhat ashamed of being seen in his present tattered and bare-headed condition
by the servants of the house; and moreover, his mind would sometimes revert to the scene which
had taken place in the garden at Allington. But he found himself obliged to obey the earl,
and so he walked on with him through the woods.

The earl did not say very much, being tired and somewhat thoughtful. In what little he did
say he seemed to be specially hurt by the ingratitude of the bull towards himself. "I never
teased him, or annoyed him in any way."

"I suppose they are dangerous beasts?" said Eames.

"Not a bit of it, if they're properly treated. It must have been my handkerchief, I suppose.
I remember that I did blow my nose."

He hardly said a word in the way of thanks to his assistant. "Where should I have been if you
had not come to me?" he had exclaimed immediately after his deliverance; but having said that
he didn't think it necessary to say much more to Eames. But he made himself very pleasant,
and by the time he had reached the house his companion was almost glad that he had been forced
to dine at the Manor House. "And now we'll have a drink," said the earl. "I don't know how
you feel, but I never was so thirsty in my life."

Two servants immediately showed themselves, and evinced some surprise at Johnny's appearance.
"Has the gentleman hurt himself, my lord?" asked the butler, looking at the blood upon our
friend's face.

"He has hurt his trousers the worst, I believe," said the earl. "And if he was to put on any
of mine they'd be too short and too big, wouldn't they? I am sorry you should be so uncomfortable,
but you mustn't mind it for once."

"I don't mind it a bit," said Johnny.

"And I'm sure I don't," said the earl. "Mr Eames is going to dine here, Vickers."

"Yes, my lord."

"And his hat is down in the middle of the nineteen acres. Let three or four men go for it."

"Three or four men, my lord!"

"Yes,--three or four men. There's something gone wrong with that bull. And you must get a boy
with a pony to take a note into Guestwick, to Mrs Eames. Oh dear, I'm better now," and he put
down the tumbler from which he'd been drinking. "Write your note here, and then we'll go and
see my pet pheasants before dinner."

Vickers and the footman knew that something had happened of much moment, for the earl was usually
very particular about his dinner-table. He expected every guest who sat there to be dressed
in such guise as the fashion of the day demanded; and he himself, though his morning costume
was by no means brilliant, never dined, even when alone, without having put himself into a
suit of black, with a white cravat, and having exchanged the old silver hunting-watch which
he carried during the day tied round his neck by a bit of old ribbon, for a small gold watch,
with a chain and seals, which in the evening always dangled over his waistcoat. Dr Gruffen
had once been asked to dinner at Guestwick Manor. "Just a bachelor's chop," said the earl;
"for there's nobody at home but myself." Whereupon Dr Gruffen had come in coloured trousers,--and
had never again been asked to dine at Guestwick Manor. All this Vickers knew well; and now
his lordship had brought young Eames home to dine with him with his clothes all hanging about
him in a manner which Vickers declared in the servants' hall wasn't more than half decent.
Therefore, they all knew that something very particular must have happened. "It's some trouble
about the bull, I know," said Vickers;--"but bless you, the bull couldn't have tore his things
in that way!" 

"there," him state that Catarrhine, after my dark. "how is the Mrs?"

"Oh, my lord--"

"It's my own watch, that I have been wearing for some time; but I've got another,--two or three,
I believe, somewhere upstairs. You mustn't refuse me. I can't bear being refused. There are
two or three little seals, too, which I have worn. I have taken off the one with my arms, because
that's of no use to you, and it is to me. It doesn't want a key, but winds up at the handle,
in this way," and the earl proceeded to explain the nature of the toy.

"My lord, you think too much of what happened to-day," said Eames, stammering.

"No, I don't; I think very little about it. I know what I think of. Put the watch in your pocket
before the doctor comes. There; I hear his horse. Why didn't he drive over, and then he could
have taken you back?"

"I can walk very well."

"I'll make that all right. The servant shall ride Crofts' horse, and bring back the little
phaeton. How d'you do, doctor? You know Eames, I suppose? You needn't look at him in that way.
His leg is not broken; it's only his trousers." And then the earl told the story of the bull.

"Johnny will become quite a hero in town," said Crofts.

"Yes; I fear he'll get the most of the credit; and yet I was at it twice as long as he was.
I'll tell you what, young men, when I got to that gate I didn't think I'd breath enough left
in me to get over it. It's all very well jumping into a hedge when you're only two-and-twenty;
but when a man comes to be sixty he likes to take his time about such things. Dinner ready,
is it? So am I. I quite forgot that mutton chop of yours to-day, doctor. But I suppose a man
may eat a good dinner after a fight with a bull?"

The evening passed by without any very pleasurable excitement, and I regret to say that the
earl went fast to sleep in the drawing-room as soon as he had swallowed his cup of coffee.
During dinner he had been very courteous to both his guests, but towards Eames he had used
a good-humoured and, almost affectionate familiarity. He had quizzed him for having been found
asleep under the tree, telling Crofts that he had looked very forlorn,--"So that I haven't
a doubt about his being in love," said the earl. And he had asked Johnny to tell the name of
the fair one, bringing up the remnants of his half-forgotten classicalities to bear out the
joke. "If I am to take more of the severe Falernian," said he, laying his hand on the decanter
of port, "I must know the lady's name. Whoever she be, I'm well sure you need not blush for
her. What! you refuse to tell! Then I'll drink no more." And so the earl had walked out of
the dining-room; but not till he had perceived by his guest's cheeks that the joke had been
too true to be pleasant. As he went, however, he leaned with his hand on Eames's shoulder,
and the servants looking on saw that the young man was to be a favourite. "He'll make him his
heir," said Vickers. "I shouldn't wonder a bit if he don't make him his heir." But to this
the footman objected, endeavouring to prove to Mr Vickers that, in accordance with the law
of the land, his lordship's second cousin, once removed, whom the earl had never seen, but
whom he was supposed to hate, must be his heir. "A hearl can never choose his own heir, like
you or me," said the footman, laying down the law. "Can't he though really, now? That's very
hard on him; isn't it?" said the pretty housemaid. "Psha," said Vickers: "you know nothing
about it. My lord could make young Eames his heir to-morrow; that is, the heir of his property.
He couldn't make him a hearl, because that must go to the heirs of his body. As to his leaving
him the place here, I don't just know how that'd be; and I'm sure Richard don't."

"But suppose he hasn't got any heirs of his body?" asked the pretty housemaid, who was rather
fond of putting down Mr Vickers.

"He must have heirs of his body," said the butler. "Everybody has 'em. If a man don't know
'em himself, the law finds 'em out." And then Mr Vickers walked away, avoiding further dispute.

In the meantime, the earl was asleep upstairs, and the two young men from Guestwick did not
find that they could amuse themselves with any satisfaction. Each took up a book; but there
are times at which a man is quite unable to read, and when a book is only a cover for his idleness
or dulness. At last, Dr Crofts suggested, in a whisper, that they might as well begin to think
of going home.

"Eh; yes; what?" said the earl, "I'm not asleep." In answer to which the doctor said that he
thought he'd go home, if his lordship would let him order his horse. But the earl was again
fast bound in slumber, and took no further notice of the proposition.

"Perhaps we could get off without waking him," suggested Eames, in a whisper.

"Eh; what?" said the earl. So they both resumed their books, and submitted themselves to their
martyrdom for a further period of fifteen minutes. At the expiration of that time, the footman
brought in tea.

"Eh, what? tea!" said the earl. "Yes, we'll have a little tea. I've heard every word you've
been saying." It was that assertion on the part of the earl which always made Lady Julia so
angry. "You cannot have heard what I have been saying, Theodore, because I have said nothing,"
she would reply. "But I should have heard it if you had," the earl would rejoin, snappishly.
On the present occasion neither Crofts nor Eames contradicted him, and he took his tea and
swallowed it while still three parts asleep.

"If you'll allow me, my lord, I think I'll order my horse," said the doctor.

"Yes; horse--yes--" said the earl, nodding.

"But what are you to do, Eames, if I ride?" said the doctor.

"I'll walk," whispered Eames, in his very lowest voice.

"What--what--what?" said the earl, jumping up on his feet. "Oh, ah, yes; going away, are you?
I suppose you might as well, as sit here and see me sleeping. But, doctor--I didn't snore, did I?"

"Only occasionally."

"Not loud, did I? Come, Eames, did I snore loud?"

"Well, my lord, you did snore rather loud two or three times."

"Did I?" said the earl, in a voice of great disappointment. "And yet, do you know, I heard
every word you said."

The small phaeton had been already ordered, and the two young men started back to Guestwick
together, a servant from the house riding the doctor's horse behind them. "Look here, Eames,"
said the earl, as they parted on the steps of the hall door. "You're going back to town the
day after to-morrow, you say, so I shan't see you again?"

"No, my lord", said Johnny.

"Look you here, now. I shall be up for the Cattle-show before Christmas. You must dine with
me at my hotel, on the twenty-second of December, Pawkins's, in Jermyn Street; seven o'clock,
sharp. Mind you do not forget, now. Put it down in your pocket-book when you get home. Good-bye,
doctor; good-bye. I see I must stick to that mutton chop in the middle of the day." And then
they drove off.

"He'll make him his heir for certain," said Vickers to himself, as he slowly returned to his
own quarters.

"You were returning from Allington, I suppose," said Crofts, "when you came across Lord De
Guest and the bull?"

"Yes: I just walked over to say good-bye to them."

"Did you find them all well?"

"I only saw one. The other two were out"

"Mrs Dale, was it?"

"No; it was Lily."

"Sitting alone, thinking of her fine London lover, of course? I suppose we ought to look upon
her as a very lucky girl. I have no doubt she thinks herself so."

"I'm sure I don't know," said Johnny.

"I believe he's a very good young man," said the doctor; "but I can't say I quite liked his
manner."

"I should think not," said Johnny.

"But then in all probability he did not like mine a bit better, or perhaps yours either. And
if so it's all fair."

"I don't see that it's a bit fair. He's a snob," said Eames; "and I don't believe that I am."
He had taken a glass or two of the earl's "severe Falernian," and was disposed to a more generous
confidence, and perhaps also to stronger language, than might otherwise have been the case.

"No; I don't think he is a snob," said Crofts. "Had he been so, Mrs Dale would have perceived it."

"You'll see," said Johnny, touching up the earl's horse with energy as he spoke. "You'll see.
A man who gives himself airs is a snob; and he gives himself airs. And I don't believe he's
a straight-forward fellow. It was a bad day for us all when he came among them at Allington."

"I can't say that I see that."

"I do. But mind, I haven't spoken a word of this to any one. And I don't mean. What would be
the good? I suppose she must marry him now?"

"Of course she must."

"And be wretched all her life. Oh-h-h-h!" and he muttered a deep groan. "I'll tell you what
it is, Crofts. He is going to take the sweetest girl out of this country that ever was in it,
and he don't deserve her."

"I don't think she can be compared to her sister," said Crofts slowly.

"What; not Lily?" said Eames, as though the proposition made by the doctor were one that could
not hold water for a minute.

"I have always thought that Bell was the more admired of the two," said Crofts.

"I'll tell you what," said Eames. "I have never yet set my eyes on any human creature whom
I thought so beautiful as Lily Dale. And now that beast is going to marry her! I'll tell you
what, Crofts; I'll manage to pick a quarrel with him yet." Whereupon the doctor, seeing the
nature of the complaint from which his companion was suffering, said nothing more, either about
Lily or about Bell.

Soon after this Eames was at his own door, and was received there by his mother and sister
with all the enthusiasm due to a hero. "He has saved the earl's life!" Mrs Eames had exclaimed
to her daughter on reading Lord De Guest's note. "Oh, goodness!" and she threw herself back
upon the sofa almost in a fainting condition.

"Saved Lord De Guest's life!" said Mary.

"Yes--under Providence," said Mrs Eames, as though that latter fact added much to her son's
good deed.

"But how did he do it?"

"By cool courage and good feeling;--so his lordship says. But I wonder how he really did do it?"

"Whatever way it was, he's torn all his clothes and lost his hat," said Mary.

"I don't care a bit about that," said Mrs Eames. "I wonder whether the earl has any interest
at the Income-tax. What a thing it would be if he could get Johnny a step. It would be seventy
pounds a year at once. He was quite right to stay and dine when his lordship asked him. And
so Dr Crofts is there. It couldn't have been anything in the doctoring way, I suppose."

"No, I should say not; because of what he says of his trousers." And so the two ladies were
obliged to wait for John's return.

"How did you do it, John?" said his mother, embracing him, as soon as the door was opened.

"How did you save the earl's life?" said Mary, who was standing behind her mother.

"Would his lordship really have been killed, if it had not been for you?" asked Mrs Eames.

"And was he very much hurt?" asked Mary.

"Oh, bother," said Johnny, on whom the results of the day's work, together with the earl's
Falernian, had made some still remaining impression. On ordinary occasions, Mrs Eames would
have felt hurt at being so answered by her son; but at the present moment she regarded him
as standing so high in general favour that she took no offence. "Oh, Johnny, do tell us. Of
course we must be very anxious to know it all."

"There's nothing to tell, except that a bull ran at the earl, as I was going by; so I went
into the field and helped him, and then he made me stay and dine with him."

"But his lordship says that you saved his life," said Mary.

"Under Providence," added their mother.

"At any rate, he has given me a gold watch and chain," said Johnny, drawing the present out
of his pocket. "I wanted a watch badly. All the same, I didn't like taking it."

"It would have been very wrong to refuse," said his mother. "And I am so glad you have been
so fortunate. And look here, Johnny: when a friend like that comes in your way, don't turn
your back on him." Then, at last, he thawed beneath their kindness, and told them the whole
of the story. I fear that in recounting the earl's efforts with the spud, he hardly spoke of
his patron with all that deference which would have been appropriate.

CHAPTER XXIII

Mr Plantagenet Palliser

A week passed over Mr Crosbie's head at Courcy Castle without much inconvenience to him from
the well-known fact of his matrimonial engagement. Both George de Courcy and John de Courcy
had in their different ways charged him with his offence, and endeavoured to annoy him by recurring
to the subject; but he did not care much for the wit or malice of George or John de Courcy.
The countess had hardly alluded to Lily Dale after those few words which she said on the first
day of his visit, and seemed perfectly willing to regard his doings at Allington as the occupation
natural to a young man in such a position. He had been seduced down to a dull country house,
and had, as a matter of course, taken to such amusements as the place afforded. He had shot
the partridges and made love to the young lady, taking those little recreations as compensation
for the tedium of the squire's society. Perhaps he had gone a little too far with the young
lady; but then no one knew better than the countess how difficult it is for a young man to
go far enough without going too far. It was not her business to make herself a censor on a
young man's conduct. The blame, no doubt, rested quite as much with Miss Dale as with him.
She was quite sorry that any young lady should be disappointed; but if girls will be imprudent,
and set their caps at men above their mark, they must encounter disappointment. With such language
did Lady de Courcy speak of the affair among her daughters, and her daughters altogether agreed
with her that it was out of the question that Mr Crosbie should marry Lily Dale. From Alexandrina
he encountered during the week none of that raillery which he had expected. He had promised
to explain to her before he left the castle all the circumstances of his acquaintance with
Lily, and she at last showed herself determined to demand the fulfilment of this promise; but,
previous to that, she said nothing to manifest either offence or a lessened friendship. And
I regret to say, that in the intercourse which had taken place between them, that friendship
was by no means less tender that it had been in London.

"And when will you tell me what you promised?" she asked him one afternoon, speaking in a low
voice, as they were standing together at the window of the billiard-room, in that idle half-hour
which always occurs before the necessity for dinner preparation has come. She had been riding
and was still in her habit, and he had returned from shooting. She knew that she looked more
than ordinarily well in her tall straight hat and riding gear, and was wont to hang about the
house, walking skilfully with her upheld drapery, during this period of the day. It was dusk,
but not dark, and there was no artificial light in the billiard-room. There had been some pretence
of knocking about the balls, but it had been only pretence. "Even Diana," she had said, "could
not have played billiards in a habit." Then she had put down her mace, and they had stood talking
together in the recess of a large bow-window.

"And what did I promise?" said Crosbie.

"You know well enough. Not that it is a matter of any special interest to me; only, as you
undertook to promise, of course my curiosity has been raised."

"If it be of no special interest" said Crosbie, "you will not object to absolve me from my
promise."

"That is just like you," she said. "And how false you men always are. You made up your mind
to buy my silence on a distasteful subject by pretending to offer me your future confidence;
and now you tell me that you do not mean to confide in me."

"You begin by telling me that the matter is one that does not in the least interest you."

"That is so false again! You know very well what I meant. Do you remember what you said to
me the day you came? and am I not bound to tell you after that, that your marriage with this
or that young lady is not matter of special interest to me? Still, as your friend--"

"Well, as my friend!"

"I shall be glad to know-- But I am not going to beg for your confidence; only I tell you this
fairly, that no man is so mean in my eyes as a man who fights under false colours."

"And am I fighting under false colours?"

"Yes, you are." And now, as she spoke, the Lady Alexandrina blushed beneath her hat; and dull
as was the remaining light of the evening, Crosbie, looking into her face, saw her heightened
colour. "Yes, you are. A gentleman is fighting under false colours who comes into a house like
this, with a public rumour of his being engaged, and then conducts himself as though nothing
of the kind existed. Of course, it is not anything to me specially; but that is fighting under
false colours. Now, sir, you may redeem the promise you made me when you first came here,--or
you may let it alone."

It must be acknowledged that the lady was fighting her battle with much courage, and also with
some skill. In three or four days Crosbie would be gone; and this victory, if it were ever
to be gained, must be gained in those three or four days. And if there were to be no victory,
then it would be only fair that Crosbie should be punished for his duplicity, and that she
should be avenged as far as any revenge might be in her power. Not that she meditated any deep
revenge, or was prepared to feel any strong anger. She liked Crosbie as well as she had ever
liked any man. She believed that he liked her also. She had no conception of any very strong
passion, but conceived that a married life was more pleasant than one of single bliss. She
had no doubt that he had promised to make Lily Dale his wife, but so had he previously promised
her, or nearly so. It was a fair game, and she would win it if she could. If she failed, she
would show her anger; but she would show it in a mild, weak manner, turning up her nose at
Lily before Crosbie's face, and saying little things against himself behind his back. Her wrath
would not carry her much beyond that.

"Now, sir, you may redeem the promise you made me when you first came here,--or you may let
it alone." So she spoke, and then she turned her face away from him, gazing out into the darkness.

"Alexandrina!" he said.

"Well, sir? But you have no right to speak to me in that style. You know that you have no right
to call me by my name in that way!"

"You mean that you insist upon your title?"

"All ladies insist on what you call their title, from gentlemen, except under the privilege
of greater intimacy than you have the right to claim. You did not call Miss Dale by her Christian
name till you had obtained permission, I suppose?"

"You used to let me call you so."

"Never! Once or twice, when you have done so, I have not forbidden it, as I should have done.
Very well, sir, as you have nothing to tell me, I will leave you. I must confess that I did
not think you were such a coward." And she prepared to go, gathering up the skirts of her habit,
and taking up the whip which she had laid on the window-sill.

"Stay a moment, Alexandrina," he said; "I am not happy, and you should not say words intended
to make me more miserable."

"And why are you unhappy?"

"Because-- I will tell you instantly, if I may believe that I am telling you only, and not
the whole household."

"Of course I shall not talk of it to others. Do you think that I cannot keep a secret?"

"It is because I have promised to marry one woman, and because I love another. I have told
you everything now; and if you choose to say again that I am fighting under false colours I
will leave the castle before you can see me again."

"Mr Crosbie!"

"Now you know it all, and may imagine whether or no I am very happy. I think you said it was
time to dress;--suppose we go?" And without further speech the two went off to their separate
rooms.

Crosbie, as soon as he was alone in his chamber, sat himself down in his arm-chair, and went
to work striving to make up his mind as to his future conduct. It must not be supposed that
the declaration just made by him had been produced solely by his difficulty at the moment.
The atmosphere of Courcy Castle had been at work upon him for the last week past. And every
word that he had heard, and every word that he had spoken, had tended to destroy all that was
good and true within him, and to foster all that was selfish and false. He had said to himself
a dozen times during that week that he never could be happy with Lily Dale, and that he never
could make her happy. And then he had used the old sophistry in his endeavour to teach himself
that it was right to do that which he wished to do. Would it not be better for Lily that he
should desert her, than marry her against the dictates of his own heart? And if he really did
not love her, would he not be committing a greater crime in marrying her than in deserting
her? He confessed to himself that he had been very wrong in allowing the outer world to get
such a hold upon him that the love of a pure girl like Lily could not suffice for his happiness.
But there was the fact, and he found himself unable to contend against it. If by any absolute
self-sacrifice he could secure Lily's well-being, he would not hesitate for a moment. But would
it be well to sacrifice her as well as himself?

He had discussed the matter in this way within his own breast, till he had almost taught himself
to believe that it was his duty to break off his engagement with Lily; and he had also almost
taught himself to believe that a marriage with a daughter of the house of Courcy, would satisfy
his ambition and assist him in his battle with the world. That Lady Alexandrina would accept
him he felt certain, if he could only induce her to forgive him for his sin in becoming engaged
to Miss Dale. How very prone she would be to forgiveness in this matter, he had not divined,
having not as yet learned how easily such a woman can forgive such a sin, if the ultimate triumph
be accorded to herself.

And there was another reason which operated much with Crosbie, urging him on in his present
mood and wishes, though it should have given an exactly opposite impulse to his heart. He had
hesitated as to marrying Lily Dale at once, because of the smallness of his income. Now he
had a prospect of considerable increase to that income. One of the commissioners at his office
had been promoted to some greater commissionership, and it was understood by everybody that
the secretary at the General Committee Office would be the new commissioner. As to that there
was no doubt. But then the question had arisen as to the place of secretary. Crosbie had received
two or three letters on the subject, and it seemed that the likelihood of his obtaining this
step in the world was by no means slight. It would increase his official income from seven
hundred a year to twelve, and would place him altogether above the world. His friend, the present
secretary, had written to him, assuring him that no other probable competitor was spoken of
as being in the field against him. If such good fortune awaited him, would it not smooth any
present difficulty which lay in the way of his marriage with Lily Dale? But, alas, he had not
looked at the matter in that light! Might not the countess help him to this preferment? And
if his destiny intended for him the good things of this world,--secretaryships, commissionerships,
chairmanships, and such like, would it not be well that he should struggle on in his upward
path by such assistance as good connections might give him?

He sat thinking over it all in his own room on that evening. He had written twice to Lily since
his arrival at Courcy Castle. His first letter has been given. His second was written much
in the same tone; though Lily, as she had read it, had unconsciously felt somewhat less satisfied
than she had been with the first. Expressions of love were not wanting, but they were vague
and without heartiness. They savoured of insincerity, though there was nothing in the words
themselves to convict them. Few liars can lie with the full roundness and self-sufficiency
of truth; and Crosbie, bad as he was, had not yet become bad enough to reach that perfection.
He had said nothing to Lily of the hopes of promotion which had been opened to him; but he
had again spoken of his own worldliness,--acknowledging that he received an unsatisfying satisfaction
from the pomps and vanities of Courcy Castle. In fact he was paving the way for that which
he had almost resolved that he would do, now he had told Lady Alexandrina that he loved her;
and he was obliged to confess to himself that the die was cast.

As he thought of all this, there was not wanting to him some of the satisfaction of an escape.
Soon after making that declaration of love at Allington he had begun to feel that in making
it he had cut his throat. He had endeavoured to persuade himself that he could live comfortably
with his throat cut in that way; and as long as Lily was with him he would believe that he
could do so; but as soon as he was again alone he would again accuse himself of suicide. This
was his frame of mind even while he was yet at Allington, and his ideas on the subject had
become stronger during his sojourn at Courcy. But the self-immolation had not been completed,
and he now began to think that he could save himself. I need hardly say that this was not all
triumph to him. Even had there been no material difficulty as to his desertion of Lily,--no
uncle, cousin, and mother whose anger he must face,--no vision of a pale face, more eloquent
of wrong in its silence than even uncle, cousin, and mother, with their indignant storm of
words,--he was not altogether heartless. How should he tell all this to the girl who had loved
him so well; who had so loved him, that, as he himself felt, her love would fashion all her
future life either for weal or for woe? "I am unworthy of her, and will tell her so," he said
to himself. How many a false hound of a man has endeavoured to salve his own conscience by
such mock humility? But he acknowledged at this moment, as he rose from his seat to dress himself,
that the die was cast, and that it was open to him now to say what he pleased to Lady Alexandrina.
"Others have gone through the same fire before," he said to himself, as he walked downstairs,
"and have come out scatheless." And then he recalled to himself the names of various men of
high repute in the world who were supposed to have committed in their younger days some such
little mistake as that into which he had been betrayed.

In passing through the hall he overtook Lady Julia De Guest, and was in time to open for her
the door of the drawing-room. He then remembered that she had come into the billiard-room at
one side, and had gone out at the other, while he was standing with Alexandrina at the window.
He had not, however, then thought much of Lady Julia; and as he now stood for her to pass by
him through the doorway, he made to her some indifferent remark.

But Lady Julia was on some subjects a stern woman, and not without a certain amount of courage.
In the last week she had seen what had been going on, and had become more and more angry. Though
she had disowned any family connection with Lily Dale, nevertheless she now felt for her sympathy
and almost affection. Nearly every day she had repeated stiffly to the countess some incident
of Crosbie's courtship and engagement to Miss Dale,--speaking of it as with absolute knowledge,
as a thing settled at all points. This she had done to the countess alone, in the presence
of the countess and Alexandrina, and also before all the female guests of the castle. But what
she had said was received simply with an incredulous smile. "Dear me! Lady Julia," the countess
had replied at last, "I shall begin to think you are in love with Mr Crosbie yourself; you
harp so constantly on this affair of his. One would think that young ladies in your part of
the world must find it very difficult to get husbands, seeing that the success of one young
lady is trumpeted so loudly." For the moment, Lady Julia was silenced; but it was not easy
to silence her altogether when she had a subject for speech near her heart.

Almost all the Courcy world were assembled in the drawing-room as she now walked into the room
with Crosbie at her heels. When she found herself near the crowd she turned round, and addressed
him in a voice more audible than that generally required for purposes of drawing-room conversation.
"Mr Crosbie," she said, "have you heard lately from our dear friend, Lily Dale?" And she looked
him full in the face, in a manner more significant, probably, than even she had intended it
to be. There was, at once, a general hush in the room, and all eyes were turned upon her and
upon him.

Crosbie instantly made an effort to bear the attack gallantly, but he felt that he could not
quite command his colour, or prevent a sudden drop of perspiration from showing itself upon
his brow. "I had a letter from Allington yesterday," he said. "I suppose you have heard of
your brother's encounter with the bull?"

"The bull!" said Lady Julia. And it was instantly manifest to all that her attack had been
foiled and her flank turned.

"Good gracious! Lady Julia, how very odd you are!" said the countess.

"But what about the bull?" asked the Honourable George.

"It seems that the earl was knocked down in the middle of one of his own fields."

"Oh, dear!" exclaimed Alexandrina. And sundry other exclamations were made by all the assembled
ladies.

"But he wasn't hurt," said Crosbie. "A young man named Eames seems to have fallen from the
sky and carried off the earl on his back."

"Ha, ha, ha, ha!" growled the other earl, as he heard of the discomfiture of his brother peer.

Lady Julia, who had received her own letters that day from Guestwick, knew that nothing of
importance had happened to her brother; but she felt that she was foiled for that time.

"I hope that there has not really been any accident," said Mr Gazebee, with a voice of great
solicitude.

"My brother was quite well last night, thank you," said she. And then the little groups again
formed themselves, and Lady Julia was left alone on the corner of a sofa.

"Was that all an invention of yours, sir?" said Alexandrina to Crosbie.

"Not quite. I did get a letter this morning from my friend Bernard Dale,--that old harridan's
nephew; and Lord De Guest has been worried by some of his animals. I wish I had told her that
his stupid old neck had been broken."

"Fie, Mr Crosbie!"

"What business has she to interfere with me?"

"But I mean to ask the same question that she asked, and you won't put me off with a cock-and-bull
story like that." But then, as she was going to ask the question, dinner was announced.

"And is it true that De Guest has been tossed by a bull?" said the earl, as soon as the ladies
were gone. He had spoken nothing during dinner except what words he had muttered into the ear
of Lady Dumbello. It was seldom that conversation had many charms for him in his own house;
but there was a savour of pleasantry in the idea of Lord De Guest having been tossed, by which
even he was tickled.

"Only knocked down, I believe," said Crosbie.

"Ha, ha, ha!" growled the earl; then he filled his glass, and allowed some one else to pass
the bottle. Poor man! There was not much left to him now in the world which did amuse him.

"I don't see anything to laugh at," said Plantagenet Palliser, who was sitting at the earl's
right hand, opposite to Lord Dumbello.

"Don't you?" said the earl. "Ha, ha, ha!"

"I'll be shot if I do. From all I hear De Guest is an uncommon good farmer. And I don't see
the joke of tossing a farmer merely because he's a nobleman also. Do you?" and he turned round
to Mr Gazebee, who was sitting on the other side. The earl was an earl, and was also Mr Gazebee's
father-in-law. Mr Plantagenet Palliser was the heir to a dukedom. Therefore, Mr Gazebee merely
simpered, and did not answer the question put to him. Mr Palliser said nothing more about it,
nor did the earl; and then the joke died away.

Mr Plantagenet Palliser was the Duke of Omnium's heir,--heir to that nobleman's title and to
his enormous wealth; and, therefore, was a man of mark in the world. He sat in the House of
Commons, of course. He was about five-and-twenty years of age, and was, as yet, unmarried.
He did not hunt or shoot or keep a yacht, and had been heard to say that he had never put a
foot upon a race-course in his life. He dressed very quietly, never changing the colour or
form of his garments; and in society was quiet, reserved, and very often silent. He was tall,
slight, and not ill-looking; but more than this cannot be said for his personal appearance--except,
indeed, this, that no one could mistake him for other than a gentleman. With his uncle, the
duke, he was on good terms;--that is to say, they had never quarrelled. A very liberal allowance
had been made to the nephew; but the two relatives had no tastes in common, and did not often
meet. Once a year Mr Palliser visited the duke at his great country seat for two or three days,
and usually dined with him two or three times during the season in London. Mr Palliser sat
for a borough which was absolutely under the duke's command; but had accepted his seat under
the distinct understanding that he was to take whatever part in politics might seem good to
himself. Under these well-understood arrangements, the duke and his heir showed to the world
quite a pattern of a happy family. "So different to the earl and Lord Porlock!" the people
of West Barsetshire used to say. For the estates, both of the duke and of the earl, were situated
in the western division of that county.

Mr Palliser was chiefly known to the world as a rising politician. We may say that he had everything
at his command, in the way of pleasure, that the world could offer him. He had wealth, position,
power, and the certainty of attaining the highest rank among, perhaps, the most brilliant nobility
of the world. He was courted by all who could get near enough to court him. It is hardly too
much to say that he might have selected a bride from all that was most beautiful and best among
English women. If he would have bought race-horses, and have expended thousands on the turf,
he would have gratified his uncle by doing so. He might have been the master of hounds, or
the slaughterer of hecatombs of birds. But to none of these things would he devote himself.
He had chosen to be a politician, and in that pursuit he laboured with a zeal and perseverance
which would have made his fortune at any profession or in any trade. He was constant in committee-rooms
up to the very middle of August. He was rarely absent from any debate of importance, and never
from any important division. Though he seldom spoke, he was always ready to speak if his purpose
required it. No man gave him credit for any great genius--few even considered that he could
become either an orator or a mighty statesman. But the world said that he was a rising man,
and old Nestor of the Cabinet looked on him as one who would be able, at some far future day,
to come among them as a younger brother. Hitherto he had declined such inferior offices as
had been offered to him, biding his time carefully; and he was as yet tied hand and neck to
no party, though known to be liberal in all his political tendencies. He was a great reader--not
taking up a book here, and another there, as chance brought books before him, but working through
an enormous course of books, getting up the great subject of the world's history,--filling
himself full of facts,--though perhaps not destined to acquire the power of using those facts
otherwise than as precedents. He strove also diligently to become a linguist--not without success,
as far as a competent understanding of various languages. He was a thin-minded, plodding, respectable
man, willing to devote all his youth to work, in order that in old age he might be allowed
to sit among the Councillors of the State.

Hitherto his name had not been coupled by the world with that of any woman whom he had been
supposed to admire; but latterly it had been observed that he had often been seen in the same
room with Lady Dumbello. It had hardly amounted to more than this; but when it was remembered
how undemonstrative were the two persons concerned,--how little disposed was either of them
to any strong display of feeling,--even this was thought matter to be mentioned. He certainly
would speak to her from time to time almost with an air of interest; and Lady Dumbello, when
she saw that he was in the room, would be observed to raise her head with some little show
of life, and to look round as though there were something there on which it might be worth
her while to allow her eyes to rest. When such innuendoes were abroad, no one would probably
make more of them than Lady de Courcy. Many, when they heard that Mr Palliser was to be at
the castle, had expressed their surprise at her success in that quarter. Others, when they
learned that Lady Dumbello had consented to become her guest, had also wondered greatly. But
when it was ascertained that the two were to be there together, her good-natured friends had
acknowledged that she was a very clever woman. To have either Mr Palliser or Lady Dumbello
would have been a feather in her cap; but to succeed in getting both, by enabling each to know
that the other would be there, was indeed a triumph. As regards Lady Dumbello, however, the
bargain was not fairly carried out; for, after all, Mr Palliser came to Courcy Castle only
for two nights and a day, and during the whole of that day he was closeted with sundry large
blue-books. As for Lady de Courcy, she did not care how he might be employed. Blue-books and
Lady Dumbello were all the same to her. Mr Palliser had been at Courcy Castle, and neither
enemy nor friend could deny the fact.

This was his second evening; and as he had promised to meet his constituents at Silverbridge
at one P.M. on the following day, with the view of explaining to them his own conduct and the
political position of the world in general; and as he was not to return from Silverbridge to
Courcy, Lady Dumbello, if she made any way at all, must take advantage of the short gleam of
sunshine which the present hour afforded her. No one, however, could say that she showed any
active disposition to monopolise Mr Palliser's attention. When he sauntered into the drawing-room
she was sitting, alone, in a large, low chair, made without arms, so as to admit the full expansion
of her dress, but hollowed and round at the back, so as to afford her the support that was
necessary to her. She had barely spoken three words since she had left the dining-room, but
the time had not passed heavily with her. Lady Julia had again attacked the countess about
Lily Dale and Mr Crosbie, and Alexandrina, driven almost to rage, had stalked off to the farther
end of the room, not concealing her special concern in the matter.

"How I do wish they were married and done with," said the countess; "and then we should hear
no more about them."

All of which Lady Dumbello heard and understood; and in all of it she took a certain interest.
She remembered such things, learning thereby who was who, and regulating her own conduct by
what she learned. She was by no means idle at this or at other such times, going through, we
may say, a considerable amount of really hard work in her manner of working. There she had
sat speechless, unless when acknowledging by a low word of assent some expression of flattery
from those around her. Then the door opened, and when Mr Palliser entered she raised her head,
and the faintest possible gleam of satisfaction might have been discerned upon her features.
But she made no attempt to speak to him; and when, as he stood at the table, he took up a book
and remained thus standing for a quarter of an hour, she neither showed nor felt any impatience.
After that Lord Dumbello came in, and he stood at the table without a book. Even then Lady
Dumbello felt no impatience.

Plantagenet Palliser skimmed through his little book, and probably learned something. When
he put it down he sipped a cup of tea, and remarked to Lady de Courcy that he believed it was
only twelve miles to Silverbridge.

"I wish it was a hundred and twelve," said the countess.

"In that case I should be forced to start to-night," said Mr Palliser.

"Then I wish it was a thousand and twelve," said Lady de Courcy.

"In that case I should not have come at all," said Mr Palliser. He did not mean to be uncivil,
and had only stated a fact.

"The young men are becoming absolute bears," said the countess to her daughter Margaretta.

He had been in the room nearly an hour when he did at last find himself standing close to Lady
Dumbello: close to her, and without any other very near neighbour.

"I should hardly have expected to find you here," he said.

"Nor I you," she answered.

"Though, for the matter of that, we are both near our own homes."

"I am not near mine."

"I meant Plumstead; your father's place."

"Yes; that was my home once."

"I wish I could show you my uncle's place. The castle is very fine, and he has some good pictures."

"So I have heard."

"Do you stay here long?"

"Oh, no. I go to Cheshire the day after to-morrow. Lord Dumbello is always there when the hunting
begins."

"Ah, yes; of course. What a happy fellow he is; never any work to do! His constituents never
trouble him, I suppose?"

"I don't think they ever do, much."

After that Mr Palliser sauntered away again, and Lady Dumbello passed the rest of the evening
in silence. It is to be hoped that they both were rewarded by that ten minutes of sympathetic
intercourse for the inconvenience which they had suffered in coming to Courcy Castle.

But that which seems so innocent to us had been looked on in a different light by the stern
moralists of that house.

"By Jove!" said the Honourable George to his cousin, Mr Gresham, "I wonder how Dumbello likes it."

"It seems to me that Dumbello takes it very easily."

"There are some men who will take anything easily," said George, who, since his own marriage,
had learned to have a holy horror of such wicked things.

"She's beginning to come out a little," said Lady Clandidlem to Lady de Courcy, when the two
old women found themselves together over a fire in some back sitting-room. "Still waters always
run deep, you know."

"I shouldn't at all wonder if she were to go off with him," said Lady de Courcy.

"He'll never be such a fool as that," said Lady Clandidlem.

"I believe men will be fools enough for anything," said Lady de Courcy. "But, of course, if
he did, it would come to nothing afterwards. I know one who would not be sorry. If ever a man
was tired of a woman, Lord Dumbello is tired of her."

But in this, as in almost everything else, the wicked old woman spoke scandal. Lord Dumbello
was still proud of his wife, and as fond of her as a man can be of a woman whose fondness depends
upon mere pride.

There had not been much that was dangerous in the conversation between Mr Palliser and Lady
Dumbello, but I cannot say the same as to that which was going on at the same moment between
Crosbie and Lady Alexandrina. She, as I have said, walked away in almost open dudgeon when
Lady Julia recommenced her attack about poor Lily, nor did she return to the general circle
during the evening. There were two large drawing-rooms at Courcy Castle, joined together by
a narrow link of a room, which might have been called a passage, had it not been lighted by
two windows coming down to the floor, carpeted as were the drawing-rooms, and warmed with a
separate fireplace. Hither she betook herself, and was soon followed by her married sister Amelia.

"That woman almost drives me mad," said Alexandrina, as they stood together with their toes
upon the fender.

"But, my dear, you of all people should not allow yourself to be driven mad on such a subject."

"That's all very well, Amelia."

"The question is this, my dear,--what does Mr Crosbie mean to do?"

"How should I know?"

"If you don't know, it will be safer to suppose that he is going to marry this girl; and in
that case--"

"Well, what in that case? Are you going to be another Lady Julia? What do I care about the girl?"

"I don't suppose you care much about the girl; and if you care as little about Mr Crosbie,
there's an end of it; only in that case, Alexandrina--"

"Well, what in that case?"

"You know I don't want to preach to you. Can't you tell me at once whether you really like
him? You and I have always been good friends." And the married sister put her arm affectionately
round the waist of her who wished to be married.

"I like him well enough."

"And has he made any declaration to you?"

"In a sort of a way he has. Hark, here he is!" And Crosbie, coming in from the larger room,
joined the sisters at the fireplace.

"We were driven away by the clack of Lady Julia's tongue," said the elder.

"I never met such a woman," said Crosbie.

"There cannot well be many like her," said Alexandrina. And after that they all stood silent
for a minute or two. Lady Amelia Gazebee was considering whether or no she would do well to
go and leave the two together. If it were intended that Mr Crosbie should marry her sister,
it would certainly be well to give him an opportunity of expressing such a wish on his own
part. But if Alexandrina was simply making a fool of herself, then it would be well for her
to stay. "I suppose she would rather I should go," said the elder sister to herself; and then,
obeying the rule which should guide all our actions from one to another, she went back and
joined the crowd.

"Will you come on into the other room?" said Crosbie.

"I think we are very well here," Alexandrina replied.

"But I wish to speak to you,--particularly," said he.

"And cannot you speak here?"

"No. They will be passing backwards and forwards." Lady Alexandrina said nothing further, but
led the way into the other large room. That also was lighted, and there were in it four or
live persons. Lady Rosina was reading a work on the Millennium, with a light to herself in
one corner. Her brother John was asleep in an arm-chair, and a young gentleman and lady were
playing chess. There was, however, ample room for Crosbie and Alexandrina to take up a position
apart.

"And now, Mr Crosbie, what have you got to say to me? But, first, I mean to repeat Lady Julia's
question, as I told you that I should do.--When did you hear last from Miss Dale?"

"It is cruel in you to ask me such a question, after what I have already told you. You know
that I have given to Miss Dale a promise of marriage."

"Very well, sir. I don't see why you should bring me in here to tell me anything that is so
publicly known as that. With such a herald as Lady Julia it was quite unnecessary."

"If you can only answer me in that tone I will make an end of it at once. When I told you of
my engagement, I told you also that another woman possessed my heart. Am I wrong to suppose
that you knew to whom I alluded?"

"Indeed, I did not, Mr Crosbie. I am no conjuror, and I have not scrutinised you so closely
as your friend Lady Julia."

"It is you that I love. I am sure I need hardly say so now."

"Hardly, indeed,--considering that you are engaged to Miss Dale."

"As to that I have, of course, to own that I have behaved foolishly;--worse than foolishly,
if you choose to say so. You cannot condemn me more absolutely than I condemn myself. But I
have made up my mind as to one thing. I will not marry where I do not love." Oh, if Lily could
have heard him as he then spoke! "It would be impossible for me to speak in terms too high
of Miss Dale; but I am quite sure that I could not make her happy as her husband."

"Why did you not think of that before you asked her?" said Alexandrina. But there was very
little of condemnation in her tone.

"I ought to have done so; but it is hardly for you to blame me with severity. Had you, when
we were last together in London--had you been less--"

"Less what?"

"Less defiant," said Crosbie, "all this might perhaps have been avoided."

Lady Alexandrina could not remember that she had been defiant; but, however, she let that pass.
"Oh, yes; of course it was my fault."

"I went down there to Allington with my heart ill at ease, and now I have fallen into this
trouble. I tell you all as it has happened. It is impossible that I should marry Miss Dale. Mind

 "I shall tell

they had betaken themselves. Lady Julia's eye was again on them as they came out from the sequestered
nook, but Alexandrina no longer cared for Lady Julia.

"George, I cannot quite understand about that Mr Palliser. Isn't he to be a duke, and oughtn't
he to be a lord now?" This question was asked by Mrs George de Courcy of her husband, when
they found themselves together in the seclusion of the nuptial chamber.

"Yes; he'll be Duke of Omnium when the old fellow dies. I think he's one of the slowest fellows
I ever came across. He'll take deuced good care of the property, though."

"But, George, do explain it to me. It is so stupid not to understand, and I am afraid of opening
my mouth for fear of blundering."

"Then keep your mouth shut, my dear. You'll learn all those sort of things in time, and nobody
notices it if you don't say anything."

"Yes, but, George;--I don't like to sit silent all the night. I'd sooner be up here with a
novel if I can't speak about anything."

"Look at Lady Dumbello. She doesn't want to be always talking."

"Lady Dumbello is very different from me. But do tell me, who is Mr Palliser?"

"He's the duke's nephew. If he were the duke's son, he would be the Marquis of Silverbridge."

"And will he be plain Mister till his uncle dies?"

"Yes, a very plain Mister."

"What a pity for him. But, George,--if I have a baby, and if he should be a boy, and if--"

"Oh, nonsense; it will be time enough to talk of that when he comes. I'm going to sleep."

CHAPTER XXIV

A Mother-in-Law and a Father-in-Law

On the following morning Mr Plantagenet Palliser was off upon his political mission before
breakfast;--either that, or else some private comfort was afforded to him in guise of solitary
rolls and coffee. The public breakfast at Courcy Castle was going on at eleven o'clock, and
at that hour Mr Palliser was already closeted with the Mayor of Silverbridge.

"I must get off by the 3.45 train," said Mr Palliser. "Who is there to speak after me?"

"Well, I shall say a few words; and Growdy,--he'll expect them to listen to him. Growdy has
always stood very firm by his grace, Mr Palliser."

"Mind we are in the room sharp at one. And you can have a fly, for me to get away to the station,
ready in the yard. I won't go a moment before I can help. I shall be just an hour and a half
myself. No, thank you, I never take any wine in the morning." And I may here state that Mr
Palliser did get away by the 3.45 train, leaving Mr Growdy still talking on the platform. Constituents
must be treated with respect; but time has become so scarce nowadays that that respect has
to be meted out by the quarter of an hour with parsimonious care.

In the meantime there was more leisure at Courcy Caste. Neither the countess nor Lady Alexandrina
came down to breakfast, but their absence gave rise to no special remark. Breakfast at the
castle was a morning meal at which people showed themselves, or did not show themselves, as
it pleased them. Lady Julia was there looking very glum, and Crosbie was sitting next to his
future sister-in-law Margaretta, who already had placed herself on terms of close affection
with him. As he finished his tea she whispered into his ear, "Mr Crosbie, if you could spare
half an hour, mamma would so like to see you in her own room." Crosbie declared that he would
be delighted to wait upon her, and did in truth feel some gratitude in being welcomed as a
son-in-law into the house. And yet he felt also that he was being caught, and that in ascending
into the private domains of the countess he would be setting the seal upon his own captivity.

Nevertheless, he went with a smiling face and a light step, Lady Margaretta ushering him the
way. "Mamma," said she, "I have brought Mr Crosbie up to you. I did not know that you were
here, Alexandrina, or I should have warned him."

The countess and her youngest daughter had been breakfasting together in the elder lady's sitting-room,
and were now seated in a very graceful and well-arranged deshabille. The tea-cups out of which
they had been drinking were made of some elegant porcelain, the teapot and cream-jug were of
chased silver and as delicate in their sway. The remnant of food consisted of morsels of French
roll which had not even been allowed to crumble themselves in a disorderly fashion, and of
infinitesimal pats of butter. If the morning meal of the two ladies had been as unsubstantial
as the appearance of the fragments indicated, it must be presumed that they intended to lunch
early. The countess herself was arrayed in an elaborate morning wrapper of figured silk, but
the simple Alexandrina wore a plain white muslin peignoir, fastened with pink ribbon. Her hair,
which she usually carried in long rolls, now hung loose over her shoulders, and certainly added
something to her stock of female charms. The countess got up as Crosbie entered and greeted
him with an open hand; but Alexandrina kept her seat, and merely nodded at him a little welcome.
"I must run down again," said Margaretta, "or I shall have left Amelia with all the cares of
the house upon her."

"Alexandrina has told me all about it," said the countess, with her sweetest smile, "and I
have given her my approval. I really do think you will suit each other very well."

"I am very much obliged to you," said Crosbie. "I'm sure at any rate of this,--that she will
suit me very well."

"Yes; I think she will. She is a good sensible girl."

"Psha, mamma; pray don't go on in that Goody Twoshoes sort of way."

"So you are, my dear. If you were not it would not be well for you to do as you are going to
do. If you were giddy and harum-scarum, and devoted to rank and wealth and that sort of thing,
it would not be well for you to marry a commoner without fortune. I'm sure Mr Crosbie will
excuse me for saying so much as that."

"Of course I know," said Crosbie, "that I had no right to look so high."

"Well; we'll say nothing more about it," said the countess.

"Pray don't," said Alexandrina. "It sounds so like a sermon."

"Sit down, Mr Crosbie," said the countess, "and let us have a little conversation. She shall
sit by you, if you like it. Nonsense, Alexandrina,--if he asks it!"

"Don't, mamma;--I mean to remain where I am."

"Very well, my dear;--then remain where you are. She is a wilful girl, Mr Crosbie; as you will
say when you hear that she has told me all that you told her last night." Upon hearing this,
he changed colour a little, but said nothing. "She has told me," continued the countess, "about
that young lady at Allington. Upon my word, I'm afraid you have been very naughty."

"I have been foolish, Lady de Courcy."

"Of course; I did not mean anything worse than that. Yes, you have been foolish;--amusing yourself
in a thoughtless way, you know, and, perhaps, a little piqued because a certain lady was not
to be won so easily as your Royal Highness wished. Well, now, all that must be settled, you
know, as quickly as possible. I don't want to ask any indiscreet questions; but if the young
lady has really been left with any idea that you meant anything, don't you think you should
undeceive her at once?"

"Of course he will, mamma."

"Of course you will; and it will be a great comfort to Alexandrina to know that the matter
is arranged. You hear what Lady Julia is saying almost every hour of her life. Now, of course,
Alexandrina does not care what an old maid like Lady Julia may say; but it will be better for
all parties that the rumour should be put a stop to. If the earl were to hear it, he might,
you know--" And the countess shook her head, thinking that she could thus best indicate what
the earl might do, if he were to take it into his head to do anything.

Crosbie could not bring himself to hold any very confidential intercourse with the countess
about Lily; but he gave a muttered assurance that he should, as a matter of course, make known
the truth to Miss Dale with as little delay as possible. He could not say exactly when he would
write, nor whether he would write to her or to her mother; but the thing should be done immediately
on his return to town.

"If it will make the matter easier, I will write to Mrs Dale," said the countess. But to this
scheme Mr Crosbie objected very strongly.

And then a few words were said about the earl. "I will tell him this afternoon," said the countess;
"and then you can see him to-morrow morning. I don't suppose he will say very much, you know;
and perhaps he may think,--you won't mind my saying it, I'm sure,--that Alexandrina might have
done better. But I don't believe that he'll raise any strong objection. There will be something
about settlements, and that sort of thing, of course." Then the countess went away, and Alexandrina
was left with her lover for half an hour. When the half-hour was over, he felt that he would
have given all that he had in the world to have back the last four-and-twenty hours of his
existence. But he had no hope. To jilt Lily Dale would, no doubt, be within his power, but
he knew that he could not jilt Lady Alexandrina de Courcy.

On the next morning at twelve o'clock he had his interview with the father, and a very unpleasant
interview it was. He was ushered into the earl's room, and found the great peer standing on
the rug, with his back to the fire, and his hands in his breeches pockets.

"So you mean to marry my daughter?" said he. "I'm not very well, as you see; I seldom am."

These last words were spoken in answer to Crosbie's greeting. Crosbie had held out his hand
to the earl, and had carried his point so far that the earl had been forced to take one of
his own out of his pocket, and give it to his proposed son-in-law.

"If your lordship has no objection. I have, at any rate, her permission to ask for yours."

"I believe you have not any fortune, have you? She's got none; of course you know that?"

"I have a few thousand pounds, and I believe she has as much."

"About as much as will buy bread to keep the two of you from starving. It's nothing to me.
You can marry her if you like; only, look here, I'll have no nonsense. I've had an old woman
in with me this morning,--one of those that are here in the house,--telling me some story about
some other girl that you have made a fool of. It's nothing to me how much of that sort of thing
you may have done, so that you do none of it here. But,--if you play any prank of that kind
with me, you'll find that you've made a mistake."

Crosbie hardly made any answer to this, but got himself out of the room as quickly as he could.

"You'd better talk to Gazebee about the trifle of money you've got," said the earl. Then he
dismissed the subject from his mind, and no doubt imagined that he had fully done his duty
by his daughter.

On the day after this, Crosbie was to go. On the last afternoon, shortly before dinner, he
was waylaid by Lady Julia, who had passed the day in preparing traps to catch him.

"Mr Crosbie," she said, "let me have one word with you. Is this true?"

"Lady Julia," he said, "I really do not know why you should inquire into my private affairs."

"Yes, sir, you do know; you know very well. That poor young lady who has no father and no brother,
is my neighbour, and her friends are my friends. She is a friend of my own, and being an old
woman, I have a right to speak for her. If this is true, Mr Crosbie, you are treating her like
a villain."

"Lady Julia, I really must decline to discuss the matter with you."

"I'll tell everybody what a villain you are; I will, indeed--a villain and a poor weak silly
fool. She was too good for you; that's what she was." Crosbie, as Lady Julia was addressing
to him the last words, hurried upstairs away from her, but her ladyship, standing on a landing-place,
spoke up loudly, so that no word should be lost on her retreating enemy.

"We positively must get rid of that woman," the countess, who heard it all, said to Margaretta.
"She is disturbing the house and disgracing herself every day."

"She went to papa this morning, mamma."

"She did not get much by that move," said the countess.

On the following morning Crosbie returned to town, but just before he left the castle he received
a third letter from Lily Dale. "I have been rather disappointed at not hearing this morning,"
said Lily, "for I thought the postman would have brought me a letter. But I know you'll be
a better boy when you get back to London, and I won't scold you. Scold you, indeed! No; I'll
never scold you, not though I shouldn't hear for a month."

He would have given all that he had in the world, three times told, if he could have blotted
out that visit to Courcy Castle from the past facts of his existence.

CHAPTER XXV

Adolphus Crosbie Spends an Evening at His Club

Crosbie, as he was being driven from the castle to the nearest station, in a dog-cart hired
from the hotel, could not keep himself from thinking of that other morning, not yet a fortnight
past, on which he had left Allington; and as he thought of it he knew that he was a villain.
On this morning Alexandrina had not come out from the house to watch his departure, and catch
the last glance of his receding figure. As he had not started very early she had sat with him
at the breakfast-table; but others also had sat there, and when he got up to go, she did no
more than smile softly and give him her hand. It had been already settled that he was to spend
his Christmas at Courcy; as it had been also settled that he was to spend it at Allington.

Lady Amelia was, of all the family, the most affectionate to him, and perhaps of them all she
was the one whose affection was worth the most. She was not a woman endowed with a very high
mind or with very noble feelings. She had begun life trusting to the nobility of her blood
for everything, and declaring somewhat loudly among her friends that her father's rank and
her mother's birth imposed on her the duty of standing closely by her own order. Nevertheless,
at the age of thirty-three she had married her father's man of business, under circumstances
which were not altogether creditable to her. But she had done her duty in her new sphere of
life with some constancy and a fixed purpose; and now that her sister was going to marry, as
she had done, a man much below herself in social standing, she was prepared to do her duty
as a sister and a sister-in-law.

"We shall be up in town in November, and of course you'll come to us at once. Albert Villa,
you know, in Hamilton Terrace, St. John's Wood. We dine at seven, and on Sundays at two; and
you'll always find a place. Mind you come to us, and make yourself quite at home. I do so hope
you and Mortimer will get on well together."

"I'm sure we shall," said Crosbie. But he had had higher hopes in marrying into this noble
family than that of becoming intimate with Mortimer Gazebee. What those hopes were he could
hardly define to himself now that he had brought himself so near to the fruition of them. Lady
de Courcy had certainly promised to write to her first cousin who was Under-Secretary of State
for India, with reference to that secretaryship at the General Committee Office; but Crosbie,
when he came to weigh in his mind what good might result to him from this, was disposed to
think that his chance of obtaining the promotion would be quite as good without the interest
of the Under-Secretary of State for India as with it. Now that he belonged, as we may say,
to this noble family, he could hardly discern what were the advantages which he had expected
from this alliance. He had said to himself that it would be much to have a countess for a mother-in-law;
but now, even already, although the possession to which he had looked was not yet garnered,
he was beginning to tell himself that the thing was not worth possessing.

As he sat in the train, with a newspaper in his hand, he went on acknowledging to himself that
he was a villain. Lady Julia had spoken the truth to him on the stairs at Courcy, and so he
confessed over and over again. But he was chiefly angry with himself for this,--that he had
been a villain without gaining anything by his villainy; that he had been a villain, and was
to lose so much by his villainy. He made comparison between Lily and Alexandrina, and owned
to himself, over and over again, that Lily would make the best wife that a man could take to
his bosom. As to Alexandrina, he knew the thinness of her character. She would stick by him,
no doubt; and in a circuitous, discontented, unhappy way, would probably be true to her duties
as a wife and mother. She would be nearly such another as Lady Amelia Gazebee. But was that
a prize sufficiently rich to make him contented with his own prowess and skill in winning it?
And was that a prize sufficiently rich to justify him to himself for his terrible villainy?
Lily Dale he had loved; and he now declared to himself that he could have continued to love
her through his whole life. But what was there for any man to love in Alexandrina de Courcy?

While resolving, during his first four or five days at the castle, that he would throw Lily
Dale overboard, he had contrived to quiet his conscience by inward allusions to sundry heroes
of romance. He had thought of Lothario, Don Juan, and of Lovelace; and had told himself that
the world had ever been full of such heroes. And the world, too, had treated such heroes well;
not punishing them at all as villains, but caressing them rather, and calling them curled darlings.
Why should not he be a curled darling as well as another? Ladies had ever been fond of the
Don Juan character, and Don Juan had generally been popular with men also. And then he named
to himself a dozen modern Lotharios,--men who were holding their heads well above water, although
it was known that they had played this lady false, and brought that other one to death's door,
or perhaps even to death itself. War and love were alike, and the world was prepared to forgive
any guile to militants in either camp.

But now that he had done the deed he found himself forced to look at it from quite another
point of view. Suddenly that character of Lothario showed itself to him in a different light,
and one in which it did not please him to look at it as belonging to himself. He began to feel
that it would be almost impossible for him to write that letter to Lily, which it was absolutely
necessary that he should write. He was in a position in which his mind would almost turn itself
to thoughts of self-destruction as the only means of escape. A fortnight ago he was a happy
man, having everything before him that a man ought to want; and now--now that he was the accepted
son-in-law of an earl, and the confident expectant of high promotion--he was the most miserable,
degraded wretch in the world!

He changed his clothes at his lodgings in Mount Street and went down to his club to dinner.
He could, at any rate, do nothing that night. His letter to Allington must, no doubt, be written
at once; but, as he could not send it before the next night's post, he was not forced to set
to work upon it that evening. As he walked along Piccadilly on his way to St. James's Square,
it occurred to him that it might be well to write a short line to Lily, telling her nothing
of the truth,--a note written as though his engagement with her was still unbroken, but yet
written with care, saying nothing about that engagement, so as to give him a little time. Then
he thought that he would telegraph to Bernard and tell everything to him. Bernard would, of
course, be prepared to avenge his cousin in some way, but for such vengeance Crosbie felt that
he should care little. Lady Julia had told him that Lily was without father or brother, thereby
accusing him of the basest cowardice. "I wish she had a dozen brothers," he said to himself.
But he hardly knew why he expressed such a wish.

He returned to London on the last day of October, and he found the streets at the West End
nearly deserted. He thought, therefore, that he should be quite alone at his club, but as he
entered the dinner room he saw one of his oldest and most intimate friends standing before
the fire. Fowler Pratt was the man who had first brought him into Sebright's, and had given
him almost his earliest start on his successful career in life. Since that time he and his
friend Fowler Pratt had lived in close communion, though Pratt had always held a certain ascendancy
in their friendship. He was in age a few years senior to Crosbie, and was in truth a man of
better parts. But he was less ambitious, less desirous of shining in the world, and much less
popular with men in general. He was possessed of a moderate private fortune on which he lived
in a quiet, modest manner, and was unmarried, not likely to marry, inoffensive, useless, and
prudent. For the first few years of Crosbie's life in London he had lived very much with his
friend Pratt, and had been accustomed to depend much on his friend's counsel; but latterly,
since he had himself become somewhat noticeable, he had found more pleasure in the society
of such men as Dale, who were not his superiors either in age or wisdom. But there had been
no coolness between him and Pratt, and now they met with perfect cordiality.

"I thought you were down in Barsetshire," said Pratt.

"And I thought you were in Switzerland."

"I have been in Switzerland," said Pratt.

"And I have been in Barsetshire," said Crosbie. Then they ordered their dinner together.

"And so you're going to be married?" said Pratt, when the waiter had carried away the cheese.

"Who told you that?"

"Well, but you are? Never mind who told me, if I was told the truth."

"But if it be not true?"

"I have heard it for the last month," said Pratt, "and it has been spoken of as a thing certain;
and it is true; is it not?"

"I believe it is," said Crosbie, slowly.

"Why, what on earth is the matter with you, that you speak of it in that way? Am I to congratulate
you, or am I not? The lady, I'm told, is a cousin of Dale's."

Crosbie had turned his chair from the table round to the fire, and said nothing in answer to
this. He sat with his glass of sherry in his hand, looking at the coals, and thinking whether
it would not be well that he should tell the whole story to Pratt. No one could give him better
advice; and no one, as far as he knew his friend, would be less shocked at the telling of such
a story. Pratt had no romance about women, and had never pretended to very high sentiments.

"Come up into the smoking-room and I'll tell you all about it," said Crosbie. So they went
off together, and, as the smoking-room was untenanted, Crosbie was able to tell his story.

He found it very hard to tell;--much harder than he had beforehand fancied. "I have got into
terrible trouble," he began by saying. Then he told how he had fallen suddenly in love with
Lily, how, he had been rash and imprudent, how nice she was--"infinitely too good for such
a man as I am," he said;--how she had accepted him, and then how he had repented. "I should
have told you beforehand," he then said, "that I was already half engaged to Lady Alexandrina
de Courcy." The reader, however, will understand that this half engagement was a fiction.

"And now you mean that you are altogether engaged to her?"

"Exactly so."

"And that Miss Dale must be told that, on second thoughts, you have changed your mind?"

"I know that I have behaved very badly," said Crosbie.

"Indeed you have," said his friend.

"It is one of those troubles in which a man finds himself involved almost before he knows where
he is."

"Well; I can't look at it exactly in that light. A man may amuse himself with a girl, and I
can understand his disappointing her and not offering to marry her,--though even that sort
of thing isn't much to my taste. But, by George, to make an offer of marriage to such a girl
as that in September, to live for a month in her family as her affianced husband, and then
coolly go away to another house in October, and make an offer to another girl of higher rank--"

"You know very well that that has had nothing to do with it."

"It looks very like it. And how are you going to communicate these tidings to Miss Dale?"

"I don't know," said Crosbie, who was beginning to be very sore.

"And you have quite made up your mind that you'll stick to the earl's daughter?"

The idea of jilting Alexandrina instead of Lily had never as yet presented itself to Crosbie,
and now, as he thought of it, he could not perceive that it was feasible.

"Yes," he said, "I shall marry Lady Alexandrina;--that is, if I do not cut the whole concern,
and my own throat into the bargain."

"If I were in your shoes I think I should cut the whole concern. I could not stand it. What
do you mean to say to Miss Dale's uncle?"

"I don't care a ---- for Miss Dale's uncle," said, Crosbie. "If he were to walk in at that
door this moment, I would tell him the whole story, without--"

As he was yet speaking, one of the club servants opened the door of the smoking-room, and seeing
Crosbie seated in a lounging-chair near the fire, went up to him with a gentleman's card. Crosbie
took the card and read the name. "Mr Dale, Allington."

"The gentleman is in the waiting-room," said the servant.

Crosbie for the moment was struck dumb. He had declared that very moment that he should feel
no personal disinclination to meet Mr Dale, and now that gentleman was within the walls of
the club, waiting to see him!

"Who's that?" asked Pratt. And then Crosbie handed him the card. "Whew-w-w-hew," whistled Pratt.

"Did you tell the gentleman I was here?" asked Crosbie.

"I said I thought you were upstairs, sir."

"That will do," said Pratt. "The gentleman will no doubt wait for a minute." And then the servant
went out of the room. "Now, Crosbie, you must make up your mind. By one of these women and
all her friends you will ever be regarded as a rascal, and they of course will look out to
punish you with such punishment as may come to their hands. You must now choose which shall
be the sufferer."

The man was a coward at heart. The reflection that he might, even now, at this moment, meet
the old squire on pleasant terms,--or at any rate not on terms of defiance, pleaded more strongly
in Lily's favour than had any other argument since Crosbie had first made up his mind to abandon
her. He did not fear personal ill-usage;--he was not afraid lest he should be kicked or beaten;
but he did not dare to face the just anger of the angry man.

"If I were you," said Pratt, "I would not go down to that man at the present moment for a trifle."

"But what can I do?"

"Shirk away out of the club. Only if you do that it seems to me that you'll have to go on shirking
for the rest of your life."

"Pratt, I must say that I expected something more like friendship from you."

"What can I do for you? There are positions in which it is impossible to help a man. I tell
you plainly that you have behaved very badly. I do not see that I can help you."

"Would you see him?"

"Certainly not, if I am to be expected to take your part."

"Take any part you like,--only tell him the truth."

"And what is the truth?"

"I was part engaged to that other girl before; and then, when I came to think of it, I knew
that I was not fit to marry Miss Dale. I know I have behaved badly; but, Pratt, thousands have
done the same thing before."

"I can only say that I have not been so unfortunate as to reckon any of those thousands among
my friends."

"You mean to tell me, then, that you are going to turn your back on me?" said Crosbie.

"I haven't said anything of the kind. I certainly won't undertake to defend you, for I don't
see that your conduct admits of defence. I will see this gentleman if you wish it, and tell
him anything that you desire me to tell him."

At this moment the servant returned with a note for Crosbie. Mr Dale had called for paper and
envelope, and sent up to him the following missive:--"Do you intend to come down to me? I know
that you are in the house." "For heaven's sake go to him," said Crosbie. "He is well aware
that I was deceived about his niece,--that I thought he was to give her some fortune. He knows
all about that, and that when I learned from him that she was to have nothing--"

"Upon my word, Crosbie, I wish you could find another messenger."

"Ah! you do not understand," said Crosbie in his agony. "You think that I am inventing this
plea about her fortune now. It isn't so. He will understand. We have talked all this over before,
and he knew how terribly I was disappointed. Shall I wait for you here, or will you come to
my lodgings? Or I will go down to the Beaufort, and will wait for you there." And it was finally
arranged that he should get himself out of this club and wait at the other for Pratt's report
of the interview.

"Do you go down first," said Crosbie.

"Yes: I had better," said Pratt. "Otherwise you may be seen. Mr Dale would have his eye upon
you, and there would be a row in the house." There was a smile of sarcasm on Pratt's face as
he spoke which angered Crosbie even in his misery, and made him long to tell his friend that
he would not trouble him with this mission,--that he would manage his own affairs himself;
but he was weakened and mentally humiliated by the sense of his own rascality, and had already
lost the power of asserting himself, and of maintaining his ascendancy. He was beginning to
recognise the fact that he had done that for which he must endure to be kicked, to be kicked
morally if not materially; and that it was no longer possible for him to hold his head up without
shame.

Pratt took Mr Dale's note in his hand and went down into the stranger's room. There he found
the squire standing, so that he could see through the open door of the room to the foot of
the stairs down which Crosbie must descend before he could leave the club. As a measure of
first precaution the ambassador closed the door; then he bowed to Mr Dale, and asked him if
he would take a chair.

"I wanted to see Mr Crosbie," said the squire.

"I have your note to that gentleman in my hand," said he. "He has thought it better that you
should have this interview with me;--and under all the circumstances perhaps it is better."

"Is he such a coward that he dare not see me?"

"There are some actions, Mr Dale, that will make a coward of any man. My friend Crosbie is,
I take it, brave enough in the ordinary sense of the word, but he has injured you."

"It is all true, then?"

"Yes, Mr Dale; I fear it is all true."

"And you call that man your friend! Mr--; I don't know what your name is."

"Pratt;--Fowler Pratt. I have known Crosbie for fourteen years,--ever since he was a boy; and
it is not my way, Mr Dale, to throw over an old friend under any circumstances."

"Not if he committed a murder."

"No; not though he committed a murder."

"If what I hear is true, this man is worse than a murderer."

"Of course, Mr Dale, I cannot know what you have heard. I believe that Mr Crosbie has behaved
very badly to your niece, Miss Dale; I believe that he was engaged to marry her, or, at any
rate, that some such proposition had been made."

"Proposition! Why, sir, it was a thing so completely understood that everybody knew it in the
county. It was so positively fixed that there was no secret about it. Upon my honour, Mr Pratt,
I can't as yet understand it. If I remember right, its not a fortnight since he left my house
at Allington,--not a fortnight. And that poor girl was with him on the morning of his going
as his betrothed bride. Not a fortnight since! And now I've had a letter from an old family
friend telling me that he is going to marry one of Lord de Courcy's daughters! I went instantly
off to Courcy, and found that he had started for London. Now, I have followed him here; and
you tell me it's all true."

"I am afraid it is, Mr Dale; too true."

"I don't understand it; I don't, indeed. I cannot bring myself to believe that the man who
was sitting the other day at my table should be so great a scoundrel. Did he mean it all the
time that he was there?"

"No; certainly not. Lady Alexandrina de Courcy was, I believe, an old friend of his;--with
whom, perhaps, he had had some lover's quarrel. On his going to Courcy they made it up, and
this is the result."

"And that is to be sufficient for my poor girl?"

"You will, of course, understand that I am not defending Mr Crosbie. The whole affair is very
sad,--very sad, indeed. I can only say, in his excuse, that he is not the first man who has
behaved badly to a lady."

"And that is his message to me, is it? And that is what I am to tell my niece? You have been
deceived by a scoundrel. But what then? You are not the first! Mr Pratt, I give you my word
as a gentleman, I do not understand it. I have lived a good deal out of the world, and am,
therefore, perhaps; more astonished than I ought to be."

"Mr Dale, I feel for you--"

"Feel for me! What is to become of my girl? And do you suppose that I will let this other marriage
go on; that I will not tell the de Courcys, and all the world at large, what sort of a man
this is,--that I will not get at him to punish him? Does he think that I will put up with this?"

"I do not know what he thinks; I must only beg that you will not mix me up in the matter--as
though I were a participator in his offence."

"Will you tell him from me that I desire to see him?"

"I do not think that that would do any good."

"Never mind, sir; you have brought me his message; will you have the goodness now to take back
mine to him?"

"Do you mean at once,--this evening,--now?"

"Yes, at once,--this evening,--now;--this minute."

"Ah; he has left the club; he is not here now; he went when I came to you."

"Then he is a coward as well as a scoundrel." In answer to which assertion, Mr Fowler Pratt
merely shrugged his shoulders.

"He is a coward as well as a scoundrel. Will you have the kindness to tell your friend from
me that he is a coward and a scoundrel,--and a liar, sir."

"If it be so, Miss Dale is well quit of her engagement."

"That is your consolation, is it? That may be all very well nowadays; but when I was a young
man, I would sooner have burnt out my tongue than have spoken in such a way on such a subject.
I would, indeed. Good-night, Mr Pratt. Pray make your friend understand that he has not yet
seen the last of the Dales; although, as you hint, the ladies of that family will no doubt
have learned that he is not fit to associate with them." Then, taking up his hat, the squire
made his way out of the club.

"I would not have done it," said Pratt to himself, "for all the beauty, and all the wealth,
and all the rank that ever were owned by a woman."

CHAPTER XXVI

Lord de Courcy in the Bosom of His Family

Lady Julia De Guest had not during her life written many letters to Mr Dale of Allington, nor
had she ever been very fond of him. But when she felt certain how things were going at Courcy,
or rather, as we may say, how they had already gone, she took pen in hand, and set herself
to work, doing, as she conceived, her duty by her neighbour.

   MY DEAR MR DALE [she said],

   I believe I need make no secret of having known that your
   niece Lilian is engaged to Mr Crosbie, of London. I think
   it proper to warn you that if this be true Mr Crosbie is
   behaving himself in a very improper manner here. I am not
   a person who concerns myself much in the affairs of other
   people; and under ordinary circumstances, the conduct of
   Mr Crosbie would be nothing to me,--or, indeed, less than
   nothing; but I do to you as I would wish that others should
   do unto me. I believe it is only too true that Mr Crosbie
   has proposed to Lady Alexandrina de Courcy, and been
   accepted by her. I think you will believe that I would not
   say this without warrant, and if there be anything in it,
   it may be well, for the poor young lady's sake, that you
   should put yourself in the way of learning the truth.

   Believe me to be yours sincerely,

   JULIA DE GUEST.

   COURCY CASTLE, Thursday.

The squire had never been very fond of any of the De Guest family, and had, perhaps, liked
Lady Julia the least of them all. He was wont to call her a meddling old woman,--remembering
her bitterness and pride in those now long bygone days in which the gallant major had run off
with Lady Fanny. When he first received this letter, he did not, on the first reading of it,
believe a word of its contents. "Cross-grained old harridan," he said out loud to his nephew.
"Look what that aunt of yours has written to me." Bernard read the letter twice, and as he
did so his face became hard and angry.

"You don't mean to say you believe it?" said the squire.

"I don't think it will be safe to disregard it."

"What! you think it possible that your friend is doing as she says?"

"It is certainly possible. He was angry when he found that Lily had no fortune."

"Heavens, Bernard! And you can speak of it in that way?"

"I don't say that it is true; but I think we should look to it. I will go to Courcy Castle
and learn the truth."
