4. The Republic.--The Constituent Assembly now dissolved itself, and a fresh Assembly, called
the Legislative, took its place. For a time things went on more peacefully. Distrust was, however,
deeply sown. The king was closely watched as an enemy; and those of the nobles who had emigrated
began to form armies, aided by the Germans, on the frontier for his rescue. This enraged the
people, who expected that their newly won liberties would be overthrown. The first time the
king exercised his right of veto the mob rose in fury; and though they then did no more than
threaten, on the advance of the emigrant army on the 10th of August, 1792, a more terrible
rising took place. The Tuilleries was sacked, the guards slaughtered, the unresisting king
and his family deposed and imprisoned in the tower of the Temple. In terror lest the nobles
in the prisons should unite with the emigrants, they were massacred by wholesale; while, with
a vigour born of the excitement, the emigrant armies were repulsed and beaten. The monarchy
came to an end; and France became a Republic, in which the National Convention, which followed
the Legislative Assembly, was supreme. The more moderate members of this were called Girondins
from the Gironde, the estuary of the Garonne, from the neighbourhood of which many of them
came. They were able men, scholars and philosophers, full of schemes for reviving classical
times, but wishing to stop short of the plans of the Jacobins, of whom the chief was Robespierre,
a lawyer from Artois, filled with fanatical notions of the rights of man. He, with a party
of other violent republicans, called the Mountain, of whom Danton and Marat were most noted,
set to work to destroy all that interfered with their plans of general equality. The guillotine,
a recently invented machine for beheading, was set in all the chief market-places, and hundreds
were put to death on the charge of "conspiring against the nation." Louis XVI. was executed
early in 1793; and it was enough to have any sort of birthright to be thought dangerous and
put to death.

5. The Reign of Terror.--Horror at the bloodshed perpetrated by the Mountain led a young girl,
named Charlotte Corday, to assassinate Marat, whom she supposed to be the chief cause of the
cruelties that were taking place; but his death only added to the dread of reaction. A Committee
of Public Safety was appointed by the Convention, and endeavoured to sweep away every being
who either seemed adverse to equality, or who might inherit any claim to rank. The queen was
put to death nine months after her husband; and the Girondins, who had begun to try to stem
the tide of slaughter, soon fell under the denunciation of the more violent. To be accused
of "conspiring against the State" was instantly fatal, and no one's life was safe. Danton was
denounced by Robespierre, and perished; and for three whole years the Reign of Terror lasted.
The emigrants, by forming an army and advancing on France, assisted by the forces of Germany,
only made matters worse. There was such a dread of the old oppressions coming back, that the
peasants were ready to fight to the death against the return of the nobles. The army, where
promotion used to go by rank instead of merit, were so glad of the change, that they were full
of fresh spirit, and repulsed the army of Germans and emigrants all along the frontier. The
city of Lyons, which had tried to resist the changes, was taken, and frightfully used by Collot
d'Herbois, a member of the Committee of Public Safety. The guillotine was too slow for him,
and he had the people mown down with grape-shot, declaring that of this great city nothing
should be left but a monument inscribed, "Lyons resisted liberty--Lyons is no more!" French,

 Austria and Russia were forced to make peace, and England
was the only country that still resisted him, till a general peace was made at Amiens in 1803;
but it only lasted for a year, for the French failed to perform the conditions, and began the
war afresh. In the mean time Buonaparte had restored religion and order, and so entirely mastered
France that, in 1804, he was able to form the republic into an empire, and affecting to be
another Charles the Great, he caused the Pope to say mass at his coronation, though he put
the crown on his own head. A concordat with the Pope reinstated the clergy, but altered the
division of the dioceses, and put the bishops and priests in the pay of the State.

8. The Empire.--The union of Italy to this new French Empire caused a fresh war with all Europe.
The Austrian army, however, was defeated at Ulm and Austerlitz, the Prussians were entirely
crushed at Jena, and the Russians fought two terrible but almost drawn battles at Eylau and
Friedland. Peace was then made with all three at Tilsit, in 1807, the terms pressing exceedingly
hard upon Prussia. Schemes of invading England were entertained by the Emperor, but were disconcerted
by the destruction of the French and Spanish fleets by Nelson at Trafalgar. Spain was then
in alliance with France; but Napoleon, treacherously getting the royal family into his hands,
seized their kingdom, making his brother Joseph its king. But the Spaniards would not submit,
and called in the English to their aid. The Peninsular War resulted in a series of victories
on the part of the English under Wellington, while Austria, beginning another war, was again
so crushed that the Emperor durst not refuse to give his daughter in marriage to Napoleon.
However, in 1812, the conquest of Russia proved an exploit beyond Napoleon's powers. He reached
Moscow with his Grand Army, but the city was burnt down immediately after his arrival, and
he had no shelter or means of support. He was forced to retreat, through a fearful winter,
without provisions and harassed by the Cossacks, who hung on the rear and cut off the stragglers,
so that his whole splendid army had become a mere miserable, broken, straggling remnant by
the time the survivors reached the Prussian frontier. He himself had hurried back to Paris
as soon as he found their case hopeless, to arrange his resistance to all Europe--for every
country rose against him on his first disaster--and the next year was spent in a series of
desperate battles in Germany between him and the Allied Powers. Lützen and Bautzen were doubtful,
but the two days' battle of Leipzic was a terrible defeat. In the year 1814, four armies--those
of Austria, Russia, England, and Prussia--entered France at once; and though Napoleon resisted,
stood bravely and skilfully, and gained single battles against Austria and Prussia, he could
not stand against all Europe. In April the Allies entered Paris, and he was forced to abdicate,
being sent under a strong guard to the little Mediterranean isle of Elba. He had drained France
of men by his constant call for soldiers, who were drawn by conscription from the whole country,
till there were not enough to do the work in the fields, and foreign prisoners had to be employed;
but he had conferred on her one great benefit in the great code of laws called the "Code Napoléon,"
which has ever since continued in force.

9. France under Napoleon.--The old laws and customs, varying in different provinces, had been
swept away, so that the field was clear; and the system of government which Napoleon devised
has remained practically unchanged from that time to this. Everything was made to depend upon
the central government. The Ministers of Religion, of Justice, of Police, of Education, etc.,
have the regulation of all interior affairs, and appoint all who work under them, so that nobody
learns how to act alone; and as the Government has been in fact ever since dependent on the
will of the people of Paris, the whole country is helplessly in their hands. The army, as in
almost all foreign nations, is raised by conscription--that is, by drawing lots among the young
men liable to serve, and who can only escape by paying a substitute to serve in their stead;
and this is generally the first object of the savings of a family. All feudal claims had been
done away with, and with them the right of primogeniture; and, indeed, it is not possible for
a testator to avoid leaving his property to be shared among his family, though he can make
some small differences in the amount each receives, and thus estates are continually freshly
divided, and some portions become very small indeed. French peasants are, however, most eager
to own land, and are usually very frugal, sober, and saving; and the country has gone on increasing
in prosperity and comfort. It is true that, probably from the long habit of concealing any
wealth they might possess, the French farmers and peasantry care little for display, or what
we should call comfort, and live rough hard-working lives even while well off and with large
hoards of wealth; but their condition has been wonderfully changed for the better ever since
the Revolution. All this has continued under the numerous changes that have taken place in
the forms of government.

CHAPTER VIII.

FRANCE SINCE THE REVOLUTION.

1. The Restoration.--The Allies left the people of France free to choose their Government,
and they accepted the old royal family, who were on their borders awaiting a recall. The son
of Louis XVI. had perished in the hands of his jailers, and thus the king's next brother, Louis
XVIII., succeeded to the throne, bringing back a large emigrant following. Things were not
settled down, when Napoleon, in the spring of 1815, escaped from Elba. The army welcomed him
with delight, and Louis was forced to flee to Ghent. However, the Allies immediately rose in
arms, and the troops of England and Prussia crushed Napoleon entirely at Waterloo, on the 18th
of June, 1815. He was sent to the lonely rock of St. Helena, in the Atlantic, whence he could
not again return to trouble the peace of Europe. There he died in 1821. Louis XVIII. was restored,
and a charter was devised by which a limited monarchy was established, a king at the head,
and two chambers--one of peers, the other of deputies, but with a very narrow franchise. It
did not, however, work amiss; till, after Louis's death in 1824, his brother, Charles X., tried
to fall back on the old system. He checked the freedom of the press, and interfered with the
freedom of elections. The consequence was a fresh revolution in July, 1830, happily with little
bloodshed, but which forced Charles X. to go into exile with his grandchild Henry, whose father,
the Duke of Berry, had been assassinated in 1820.

2. Reign of Louis Philippe.--The chambers of deputies offered the crown to Louis Philippe,
Duke of Orleans. He was descended from the regent; his father had been one of the democratic
party in the Revolution, and, when titles were abolished, had called himself Philip Egalité
(Equality). This had not saved his head under the Reign of Terror, and his son had been obliged
to flee and lead a wandering life, at one time gaining his livelihood by teaching mathematics
at a school in Switzerland. He had recovered his family estates at the Restoration, and, as
the head of the Liberal party, was very popular. He was elected King of the French, not of
France, with a chamber of peers nominated for life only, and another of deputies elected by
voters, whose qualification was two hundred francs, or eight pounds a year. He did his utmost
to gain the good will of the people, living a simple, friendly family life, and trying to merit
the term of the "citizen king," and in the earlier years of his reign he was successful. The
country was prosperous, and a great colony was settled in Algiers, and endured a long and desperate
war with the wild Arab tribes. A colony was also established in New Caledonia, in the Pacific,
and attempts were carried out to compensate thus for the losses of colonial possessions which
France had sustained in wars with England. Discontents, however, began to arise, on the one
hand from those who remembered only the successes of Buonaparte, and not the miseries they
had caused, and on the other from the working-classes, who declared that the bourgeois, or
tradespeople, had gained everything by the revolution of July, but they themselves nothing.
Louis Philippe did his best to gratify and amuse the people by sending for the remains of Napoleon,
and giving him a magnificent funeral and splendid monument among his old soldiers--the Invalides;
but his popularity was waning. In 1842 his eldest son, the Duke of Orleans, a favourite with
the people, was killed by a fall from his carriage, and this was another shock to his throne.
Two young grandsons were left; and the king had also several sons, one of whom, the Duke of
Montpensier, he gave in marriage to Louise, the sister and heiress presumptive to the Queen
of Spain; though, by treaty with the other European Powers, it had been agreed that she should
not marry a French prince unless the queen had children of her own. And when i saw four girls
and baking all day i wondered what him was all about.

of seeing him dreamt of really. CLINTON, penn, Motor.


3. The Revolution of 1848.--In spite of the increased prosperity of the country, there was
general disaffection. There were four parties--the Orleanists, who held by Louis Philippe and
his minister Guizot, and whose badge was the tricolour; the Legitimists, who retained their
loyalty to the exiled Henry, and whose symbol was the white Bourbon flag; the Buonapartists;
and the Republicans, whose badge was the red cap and flag. A demand for a franchise that should
include the mass of the people was rejected, and the general displeasure poured itself out
in speeches at political banquets. An attempt to stop one of these led to an uproar. The National
Guard refused to fire on the people, and their fury rose unchecked; so that the king, thinking
resistance vain, signed an abdication, and fled to England in February, 1848. We live they on
hearts.

"Some streets have not learned out just signed amid fire was signed to disturbances through
their hearts. One of these lying on litter greeted the lassie refused
from England, was there come to France to boys when they were put:"

"Her eyes with their tears as she acknowledge one
of new friends of an trenches, and noticed how vain he was not now,
he who had been the strongest to the rights. After some months,
a republic was determined on, which was to have a president at its head, chosen every five
years by universal suffrage. Louis Napoleon Buonaparte, nephew to the great Napoleon, was the
first president thus chosen; and, after some struggles, he not only mastered Paris, but, by
the help of the army, which was mostly Buonapartist, he dismissed the chamber of deputies,
and imprisoned or exiled all the opponents whom the troops had not put to death, on the plea
of an expected rising of the mob. This was called a coup d'état, and Louis Napoleon was then
declared president for ten years.
