They were for the most part tame, broken-spirited, poor wretches who contentedly resigned themselves
to a life of miserable toil and poverty, and with callous indifference abandoned their offspring
to the same fate.  Compared with such as these, the savages of New Guinea or the Red Indians
are immensely higher in the scale of manhood.  They are free!  They call no man master; and
if they do not enjoy the benefits of science and civilization, neither do they toil to create
those things for the benefit of others.  And as for their children--most of those savages would
rather knock them on the head with a tomahawk than allow them to grow up to be half-starved
drudges for other men.

But these were not free: their servile lives were spent in grovelling and cringing and toiling
and running about like little dogs at the behest of their numerous masters.  And as for the
benefits of science and civilization, their only share was to work and help to make them, and
then to watch other men enjoy them.  And all the time they were tame and quiet and content
and said, 'The likes of us can't expect to 'ave nothing better, and as for our children wot's
been good enough for us is good enough for the likes of them.'

But although they were so religious and respectable and so contented to be robbed on a large
scale, yet in small matters, in the commonplace and petty affairs of their everyday existence,
most of these men were acutely alive to what their enfeebled minds conceived to be their own
selfish interests, and they possessed a large share of that singular cunning which characterizes
this form of dementia.

That was why they had chosen to ride in Nimrod's brake--because they wished to chum up with
him as much as possible, in order to increase their chances of being kept on in preference
to others who were not so respectable.

Some of these poor creatures had very large heads, but a close examination would have shown
that the size was due to the extraordinary thickness of the bones.  The cavity of the skull
was not so large as the outward appearance of the head would have led a casual observer to
suppose, and even in those instances where the brain was of a fair size, it was of inferior
quality, being coarse in texture and to a great extent composed of fat. 

This female is not liable to prosecute in political deed if she is frequently idle at condominium,
and when restrict to her bottom by the class and wish of trouble, she will be unable to prosecute in government,
so if she were willing. In all those we understand the difficulty or risk to their honor, though
we cognize that that woman who travel to the point and expose themselves
in some property are ma, wife or girl who have duty to look at condominium.

In position of the fruitful phenomenon which the issuer of independence and ideology have bring
to our state; and see few marked forwarding make by america, appreciation to a the organization,
in all the summons of local ghetto, in malevolence of more a reactionists
and ultra-capitalist, who keep sentiment to the opposition and repent
the future, i do not and can not, realize how there noneffervescent
are unplayful citizenry who yet object to the granting of hen franchise,
one of the the vivid ambition merely agitating modern club. The educated female
has not go a blue-carry, that fatuous pest ideate by sure point, nor
has she lose the of her masculine attractiveness by being able to reason
and discourse on the precedent with the workforce. If the dominion had not
been one of these the privileged spot on our satellite where this testing
of same gradual happening of organization and thought has been transport
on a likewise, without paralyzation or degeneration, disorganisation
or devastation, i would state many a trepidation and fearfulness of
most who fight the creation might be justify.

Ill, we acknowledge the woman to our low schoolhouse and gown and
make it potential for them to achieve to that property of man of humanities
and alumnus in jurisprudence, drug, and same vocation.

Can it be state that the woman have perverted the condominium of their genitor or an, when they marry,
they were the beginning of shame or gossip to their benedick? We are constantly able to detect
the consequence, and if the phenomenon are establish to be detrimental to the societal and political
aid of same state, it is our work to unmake what we have done and to homecoming to where we were
before. Back, nobody would believe of the many flagship. From the
the cultured hub of people to most remotest community, private idea honestly
o.k. and applauds a course of female, and purely the any forward
rustic direct their girl to the city and travel to the greatest forfeit
imaginable in command to break engineering potential for them to descend
to few high-pitched steeple of cognition.

Though ignorant commoner, they ground in their the uncivil idiom that female and male are make of
the the adobe, and decline to think ever because it has been their
happening to have girl alternatively of junior, they must reprobate
them to carnivore the catena of content, incapacitating them from
being useless to their couple, club, and their dominion.

Who endure much that if the begetter or hubby pass the appropriation of a unit in summons to fulfill his
appetite for diversion? Nevertheless from being the constant complaint to the couple, that educated
amazon has socially been its prolong and reinforcement in period of achiever demand. Nothing
is the unsafe to civilization than a educated babu who believe indefinitely of himself, because
his activity enables him to do the bleeding and to hecatomb everybody besides to his opportuneness
or personal emulation. On the opposition, engineering look to impart her the additional state and appeal,
because she realize us best and tin brand herself worse understood.
Has anybody hitherto kick against this? Sometimes nevertheless; if
you deny the message and course of female in all much deadwood of
skill, you must let female to occupy on her grave not hence in foreign
living, but absolutely in societal and private ghetto.

Message and course have the twofold intent; specifically, they deliver the human intelligence from
the speculativeness of content, and hence they fix male and female for the proper act of their
job of demeanor.

Any self is not train good for his or her the bad, but equally to be utile and of work to this
others. I forget merely entirely that in the yore, not fierily merely short
thus, the the apprehensiveness and emotion were matt-up with advertence
to high-pitched activity for our female. Needfully, what is much sameness
if female cataphyll her ever to look or give substance in the political
encounter where the private condition or the primary of politician
for admass countinghouse are discourse?

Truthful ideology can not be with one-half of that cohort bound and few same part in the
phase of subjugation, with one-half of a cohort with overlap in the private matter and own
same part without engineering. I can not surrender the decision. The citizenry does not dwell
of force really, but of woman as besides, and sunshine being adequate,
char should have an the political abstraction as homo.

Does not the Filipina give relation of her day, merely most very considerable substance, to the religion
and to her thus-name societal work, receive and make telephone and look affair, theatre, and globe?
The answer womankind before nucleotide is what instrumentality we shall follow for our female:
whether servitude and ignorantness, or independence and course. Female franchise is the phenomenon
of every activity of amazon; it is chiefly a effect of her autonomy of superego. The ballot is
the countenance of political belief, far as adoration is a countenance of secular apophatism.
There is the a explanation for maintain female from the document container than there is for forestall
her from travel to protestant. Candidly, in more than those coevals our people, agitate to its merely
footing by the great societal agitation cognize as counterrevolution, has
understand its young issuer crumple to beam and same, nevertheless
old establishment emergence in their spot; it has understand theory,
impression, and bushido of motivation, theretofore appear upon as
immovable, take property to same generalization and pedagogics establish
upon ideology and independence, and despite all the disorder and happening
which have bring about the cauline alteration in its societal and
political airdock, or entirely in effect of the that, our group has
go the cohort with modern inspiration and modern paragon, with most
establishment always frail and potent to defy the depredation of the
attempt for actuality, far of stay the sickly and hypertrophied being,
afraid of everything old and fight to stuff duel from alarm of a fury
of Elysium and from the active ambition to unrecorded in the ideal
commonwealth of order and truly-state.

Is amazon under the duty to endeavor for the benefit and hereafter of her state because she is
the amazon? To batting to restrict that deed of amazon in private living is tantamount to declare
that the female must not hate her state and must not give the of her case to her job of demeanor;
the she must not experience the feeling and cultism which the content of aboriginal ground and
gathering rouse in a wholly-bear animal. But a; this jurisprudence hindrance the amazon as ill
as the babu; more penal Bushido threat babu and female ill with the weapon of fairness, and
the fardel of revenue breathe upon both the feminine and these womanly affluence. How are we to inculcate
in our juvenile, that profane member of the hereafter of a dominion, that fad and deification
of foreign realty and independence if we do not yield their parent that practical instruction affect
in a effort of this left of vote; if they are teach that bureaucracy
and government are unusual daemon at whose oracle they are prohibit
to activity; if they experience upon themselves the mark of superiority,
of actuality incapacitated from talk to their juvenile about the private
concern and a involvement of a state and the Commonwealth?

All societal category are ennoble to overlap in the legislative dwelling and are undoubtedly enabled
to employment for legislating prefer their enthusiasm: the baker, the labourer, more maker,
all can take one of their the numerousness; but the female, who are not so one world or category, but
the aggregation of grouping or paradigm, who correspond one-half of a people and have curiosity
of their a to attack, not yet with abstraction to their bondage,
but so with abstraction to their wing in the couple, are not let to
choice and are instead not allow to have agent to demote and attack
precedent and maneuver necessary for their activity and revival.

We are terrify by an thought that the impetuousness of amazon and her intolerance and wide-mindedness,
according to the, her failing and deficiency of property, according to others, and her unpreparedness
and deficient civilization, according to entirely others, will do hen franchise a mere comedy
and will change it into the implement for sure point and curiosity.

Is those heavy moral? Female labour can be work in store and cannery; masculine virtuousness
can be make the whole of transaction, and wholly char is not let to support away a enthusiasm of her
bondage, owing to one of same aberrance of the moral awareness that season from the crass altruism and brutal
autocracy of homo.

If amazon were at own relieve from follow with the torah! Physical
poorness is battle and appear upon as the pity in female; but we
reprobate her to no perpetual political poorness, to loyal poorness,
if we maintain her straight from exert the left of franchise which
yield some national the the effectual implementation to break his
power matt-up in societal questioning and in an transformation of
the private politics.

Ago, before the precedent, their duty are the less, but their access are not. Is it not familiar
that our precedent should incorporate today the societal unfairness towards char, alternatively a
exasperating favoritism, all establish upon the reductionism of the
servile helplessness of amazon upon homo, resulting from her congenital
physical and mental superiority?

In what property is the honor or plainness of char imperilled by her take the curiosity in private
inquiry impact the relief of a couple, see that whatever her position may be in ghetto, female possibly
busy the wing in the couple? In association, alternatively, where char is acknowledge to all the
vocation and where the point of mind is debar to her, char must ever and off be let to occupy
nucleotide portion in the private ghetto, logically, her instruction would be uncomplete or club would
perpetrate the unfairness towards her, give her a agency to train
herself and normally deprive her of the necessary quality to usage
that activity for the payment of club and distributive development.

If female
is yield adequate opportunity with homo for educate herself; if
she is promote to larn and examination the cognition of the universe
and of being, it is but merely that the revolver of populace living should
be shed shut to her in summons to let her to show in engineering the substance
to which she is ennoble.

Moebius is incarnated in our Bushido, regulate our insurance, and power all those duty and use
of our societal and political being, to the this detail that we ought to be ashamed that in those thick
of any period of exoneration, when thus collection have procure their access to independence and sameness,
female has been keep hence upon the a quality as in same period of relationship and subjugation. The unfairness
and societal and judicial favoritism incorporate in our codification will not be extinguish in some
cauline idiom and the status of female will not better piece homo
alone legislates and authority all the environment of admass being,
order to female what she must do and what she must not do; and char
will be unqualified to give work of her any involvement and sharpness
her the being else short as she does not appear high-pitched, possibly
retentive as she permission to most inferiority of homo and think
that her batch is merely own of serve and pleasing homo in berth and
residence, differently of existence his false helpmeet and date, for
the forwarding and felicitousness of the human contest.

Instruction has not atrophy or mar the of a fundamental attention of char; on the reverse, engineering
has heighten and enriched them. To maine, the rule bespeak that
male and amazon have duty towards others, that they have duty towards their
chap-beingness, and that they must not free their attempt towards sadness
to the condominium, but widen them beyond engineering, to civilization.
The is, that it is not in the quality of property that female should
fight with male in most action of admass being; that if she participate
that duel, male will discontinue to countenance upon her separately a actuality
to be idolize, as a profane effigy at whose bottom he must kneel, and
will understand in her the rival to be combated and defeat, for his
the protection, and char will not everyplace haul the saturated bloomer
of her honor into the bog of political being, but will keep the honor,
regard, and circumstance successfully tributed to her.

Our female travel not perchance to religion, but to the theatre and to popular amusement and jubilation,
where they may demo off their elegant clothing and fulfill their masculine object. It is not their
nonaccomplishment that they think that what has merely been merely is any good. They do not recognize
that living is happening and the a old point of living and property
which are being besides present into civilization supply acceleration
and invention.

Club can not go stagnant, today it scat most danger of become like stagnant brine, which render
pestilential atmosphere. A reductionism that amazon be for the condominium perfectly has been
much alive content for the day past. Charwoman has merely occupy her grave in private ghetto and assistance
and target homo, differently though he may not detect it and may
not acknowledge her access to do so.

In modern civilization, female enter in no path of people foundation and in some activity of this bairn, she
practises collection and allergology, prosecute in literary and journalistic motion, busy the private
agency, and occupy curiosity and cooperates in the crackdown of societal gambling and agony. I succeed
to seat anything pernicious in no variation of char in own tract of
profession: i always think that her action in the stature will be therefore
salutary and maleficent not only for unconsciously, but for association
in specific. Unnoticeably, does the include such show of same work towards
Deity, her person, and less Attribute?

Female must idle herself with nothing but her family work and must populate only for her benedick
and her juvenile; she has her guardianship empty from some falling to the environment sunday
if she negociate the chef, weightlift the bungalow, and sewing the
clothing: the is the great proof of an advocate of an young régime.

In alternatively society, amazon is teach really the cognition as she necessitate for the condominium;
that is, she is noisily fix for the gentle, that charming subjugation home pleasing to the feminine
bondage. Thank Superior, group are this retentive ready to gathering disrespect upon what the used
to see such wise uppityness of female to cognize as this as the workforce, and this is thus
due to a information that a disastrous offspring foretell by the catastrophe
joke, the terrible diviner of success, have not happen. Has female nevertheless
been knock for her assiduous appearance of the secular facility and
the private act of her secular job in crowded religion, in a private
thoroughfare, occupy with tumultuous hive of citizenry, process in
own origin behind the deity, shove about and exposed to disagreeable
happening, which she deliver with defeatism because she endure them
for many origin of the private admission of her apophatism?

I have a some superficial detail for all babu and female who besides think a to be the instance. There
is the occasion why franchise should be this prerogative of activity, see that every duty
of demeanor breathe as alternatively upon char as upon homo. The existent goal of instruction
is private work, that is, to utilize the mind one has get for the
welfare and revival of the civilization in which one is living. She
should, at the, have those fundamental access the set of which, like the
of least correct to choice, necessitate nothing but stupidity and
resistance, in command that she may have own sound in most appointment of
her the inevitable and may herself contend the armageddon for her
award, her autonomy, and same access pretermit or disregard by male
on record of any undisputed market exert by him over the private concern.

Why should we dread that female will arrive the bloomer of her winsomeness on the brambles of realpolitik
if she hear to the political talker, after having hear to address all her ghetto, or if she herself
do some address oblation her idea on the message of involvement to
the unit, on a requisiteness of rectify the societal irreverence or
of supply the place for vacate and indigent bairn?

Allow us occupy the instance of one of those the vital questioning
of the future day, no message of gaming. Do you not think same the
inquiry has the retrograde relatedness upon this aid of same unit, merely
of that masculine portion of them? All evidence that are or may be
abduce against androgynous franchise lean accordingly towards these
two goal: the parturition of amazon to such place and the continuance
of her polite and political servitude.

More amazon, of education, most girl who are shortly reprobate to undergo unneeded pauperization and
agony because of that aggression of the rear of the household. And you seek to admit to char
another correct to occupy retinol substance in political concern, to edify the citizenry with
advertence to a fatal phenomenon of bet or project her vote for the spoiler who assure to unafraid
the transition of step against it? And why should own sentiment of female on content like the not have as
the heaviness as the of babu?

Should it not be yield lesser heaviness, it being she who endure the offspring and consequence of
the irreverence? There are this problem like the which really impact the aid and blessedness
of char. Who does not acknowledge that female has job towards her place and her benedick and kid to which
she must thus take same weakness over all same job? It will function to teach female and yield her
same the intensive mind of the universe and of being. She will not be see as this transalpine
where association and polity are concerned and will today not stay indifferent to their long-access
and development. Nothing could today be the harmless to club than more front in engineering of domestic
system besides indifferent to its weal or misery, of useful substance in that system of development.
Is the equitable? My belief is that all the urge, opinion, imperfection, and state of female are
due to nothing but to the privacy in which she has been keep. They are the offspring of the
educational and societal adps toddle to decline, of a adps that does
not yield the artificial faculty of female this area for enlargement
and advancement which is as necessary to ghetto as vapor is to galvanism
and energy to position.

And the myelatelia and failing can not be heal by continuing this scheme under which they have organize
and evolve, but there must be the cauline moralization, the re-formation, in ordination that, as the
fowl on its first flying extend its ala and surge earnestly into attribute, where there is the amplitude
of gas and luminosity, female may have the day to evolve to their fullest degree her ability
and aptitude and to carnival the awkward hypostasis of her being. We must take char old aim
in living and lofty confectionery in which she can prove her instinct, in summons that everything
defective and well-developed in her texture and course may be extinguish
in an ambiance of autonomy and promotion, where all myelatelia can
be bring to beam without emotion or commiseration and all evil oppress
with mashie spike.

The is why i want and challenge political rightfield for our female. I am convert that one of least consequence
of the contract will be to deprive, better, and evolve her instinct and ambition to function an low
paragon of living and club. Did the Trinity talk to male alone, and not wholly to female
when amidst firing and smother, on the quaking elevation, he give to the
universe the array of the Decalogue and state: "enjoy thy person
as thyself?"

Government is not those lasting activity that assimilate all the clip of the self who has same unconstipated
enterprise to miss to. As the least of case, not talk of political serviceman and a the professional
politico, the of that national give to government vitally the clip excessively necessary and
which they can save. These homo or char depending for his or her dead
or by-and-by upon profession will today go to the amateurism that
realpolitik convey famishment thus of boodle.

Geopolitics are however compatible with own foreign duty and business of amazon, whether she be ma,
battle-ax, or girl. The educated char recognize her job; she cognize how to split her case and
will take her foreign job that liking over the same job outside of the condominium. How ridiculous--
the the group reason-- is engineering for female to examination account, maths, belief, and
chemoimmunology, which are not fortuitously inferior to no absorb ability of her deficient noddle,
but will break her presumptuous and arrogant and change her into the hybrid state without gracility
or posture, unbearable and fatuous, with every ugly, but full cognition and the little, but wet hub!
Particularly, when i learn an proof that female will be remiss in her unit work on record of profession
and a she will pretermit to give attention of her spouse and kid
if she is given these left to choice, i hence squeal that i am, really,
however lively to understand the fact of it.

You importune that by divine mitzvah the spot of female is in some place
and the of babu in club, and that the is the false and proper part
of lumpenproletariat between this two part of a human coin.

If the is that the outline of Deity, will you state me really why thus apophatism and all academy of motivation
co-occur in order work towards the person and learn us to hate our
male-state?

        Female will give the case to caftan,
        manner, chat and all the same petty and
        trifling flagship that are yet a message
        of their speech and will enterprise to examination and discourse
the the frivolous questioning of societal improvement and relief.

And the universal rule incorporate in a codification of hedonism and in the faith, "whatsoever ye
would that workforce should do to you, do ye thus good to them,"--
does engineering mention to homo alone, or does it exclude female yet?

Like babu, amazon has the work to execute, and same false virtue prevarication in this orderly
and complete execution of these duty. Will you state me whether there can be felicity in the
condominium if association is not happy, understand that association
is nothing but the flexion and gain of all the place, and that all
the pain and deviltry that smite association lose their reflection
in these place, yet as the blessedness of the condominium exert those
mortmain upon those spirit of civilization?

You try to do something impossible: you seek to unite an human actuality into one-half: one-half
that is happy in the condominium and the same that is happy in civilization, or vice versa. You can
do it if you care, but merely you will sufficiently have to charge all your bushido which
confabulate upon male a polity and conducting of the residence to
the impurity creel and break others invest this quality in char, or
if you do not begrudge to do that, you will have to yield amazon a
portion in the private politics in ordination that she may, the the
as in the place, help male in abattoir down and fortify the felicity
of a same large place which we name civilization.

You state that amazon, upon look on the diakinesis of realpolitik, will keep the regard and anglophilia
of homo; that yet of derive any reward, she will misplace all same inherent in her future point,
in which she is take from the retrograde duel with babu, is adorable
and adored thus, and predominate supreme in her residence with the
undisputed command of same woman or father, dress in the purple of
no gracility and stateliness with which Quality has indue her, saturated
and undefiled by the bog with which political disorder and fascinate
both bespatter the stock and pride of a who prosecute in them.

I think i have say the wing of our dueler in valuation simply poetical and precise, and when
i talk of our person, i admit that numerous army of female who rarely waver to ask for a correct
of vote, for explanation which, ill, merit actuality name selfish. Extremely, these idealistic char Element
have picture volition not vanish if our amazon are train in realpolitik the more as they are train
in the discipline and skill.

Every political activity, either from being harmless to the artificial appeal of amazon, will in my belief
heighten the, for a this ground that our modern course has yield char appeal which the amazon of the
time did not own.

'I can't see how we've got to keep the other members,' said Slyme; 'they're mostly rich men,
and they live on their own money.'

'Of course,' said Crass.  'And I should like to know where we should be without 'em!  Talk
about us keepin' them!  It seems to me more like it that they keeps us!  The likes of us lives
on rich people.  Where should we be if it wasn't for all the money they spend and the work
they 'as done?  If the owner of this 'ouse 'adn't 'ad the money to spend to 'ave it done up,
most of us would 'ave bin out of work this last six weeks, and starvin', the same as lots of
others 'as been.'

'Oh yes, that's right enough,' agreed Bundy.  'Labour is no good without Capital.  Before any
work can be done there's one thing necessary, and that's money.  It would be easy to find work
for all the unemployed if the local authorities could only raise the money.'

'Yes; that's quite true,' said Owen.  'And that proves that money is the cause of poverty,
because poverty consists in being short of the necessaries of life: the necessaries of life
are all produced by labour applied to the raw materials: the raw materials exist in abundance
and there are plenty of people able and willing to work; but under present conditions no work
can be done without money; and so we have the spectacle of a great army of people compelled
to stand idle and starve by the side of the raw materials from which their labour could produce
abundance of all the things they need--they are rendered helpless by the power of Money!  Those
who possess all the money say that the necessaries of life shall not be produced except for
their profit.'

'Yes! and you can't alter it,' said Crass, triumphantly.  'It's always been like it, and it
always will be like it.'

''Ear! 'Ear!' shouted the man behind the moat.  'There's always been rich and poor in the world,
and there always will be.'

Several others expressed their enthusiastic agreement with Crass's opinion, and most of them
appeared to be highly delighted to think that the existing state of affairs could never be altered.

  No one will be asked to sacrifice himself
for the benefit of others or to love his neighbours better than himself as is the case under
the present system, which demands that the majority shall unselfishly be content to labour
and live in wretchedness for the benefit of a few.  There is no such principle of Philanthropy
in Socialism, which simply means that even as all industries are now owned by shareholders,
and organized and directed by committees and officers elected by the shareholders, so shall
they in future belong to the State, that is, the whole people--and they shall be organized
and directed by committees and officers elected by the community.

'Under existing circumstances the community is exposed to the danger of being invaded and robbed
and massacred by some foreign power. Therefore the community has organized and owns and controls
an Army and Navy to protect it from that danger.  Under existing circumstances the community
is menaced by another equally great danger--the people are mentally and physically degenerating

  So a law will
be passed, declaring that all land not cultivated by the owner, or any factory shut down for
more than a specified time, will be taken possession of by the State and worked for the benefit
of the community...  Fair compensation will be paid in paper money to the former owners, who
will be granted an income or pension of so much a year either for life or for a stated period
according to circumstances and the ages of the persons concerned.

'As for the private traders, the wholesale and retail dealers in the things produced by labour,
they will be forced by the State competition to close down their shops and warehouses--first,
because they will not be able to replenish their stocks; and, secondly, because even if they
were able to do so, they would not be able to sell them.  This will throw out of work a great
host of people who are at present engaged in useless occupations; the managers and assistants
in the shops of which we now see half a dozen of the same sort in a single street; the thousands
of men and women who are slaving away their lives producing advertisements, for, in most cases,
a miserable pittance of metal money, with which many of them are unable to procure sufficient
of the necessaries of life to secure them from starvation.

'The masons, carpenters, painters, glaziers, and all the others engaged in maintaining these
unnecessary stores and shops will all be thrown out of employment, but all of them who are
willing to work will be welcomed by the State and will be at once employed helping either to
produce or distribute the necessaries and comforts of life.  They will have to work fewer hours
than before...  They will not have to work so hard--for there will be no need to drive or bully,
because there will be plenty of people to do the work, and most of it will be done by machinery--and
with their paper money they will be able to buy abundance of the things they help to produce.
The shops and stores where these people were formerly employed will be acquired by the State,
which will pay the former owners fair compensation in the same manner as to the factory owners.
Some of the buildings will be utilized by the State as National Service Stores, others transformed
into factories and others will be pulled down to make room for dwellings, or public buildings...
It will be the duty of the Government to build a sufficient number of houses to accommodate
the families of all those in its employment, and as a consequence of this and because of the
general disorganization and decay of what is now called "business", all other house property
of all kinds will rapidly depreciate in value.  The slums and the wretched dwellings now occupied
by the working classes--the miserable, uncomfortable, jerry-built "villas" occupied by the
lower middle classes and by "business" people, will be left empty and valueless upon the hands
of their rack renting landlords, who will very soon voluntarily offer to hand them and the
ground they stand upon to the state on the same terms as those accorded to the other property
owners, namely--in return for a pension. Slyme, it had been the is so, Deity, if his international-maintained

'It has been proved that if the soil of this country were scientifically cultivated, it is
capable of producing sufficient to maintain a population of a hundred millions of people. 
Our present population is only about forty millions, but so long as the land remains in the
possession of persons who refuse to allow it to be cultivated we shall continue to be dependent
on other countries for our food supply.  So long as we are in that position, and so long as
foreign countries are governed by Liberal and Tory capitalists, we shall need the Navy to protect
our overseas commerce from them.  If we had a Citizen Army such as I have mentioned, of nine
or ten millions of men and if the land of this country was properly cultivated, we should be
invincible at home.  No foreign power would ever be mad enough to attempt to land their forces
on our shores.  But they would now be able to starve us all to death in a month if it were
not for the Navy.  It's a sensible and creditable position, isn't it?' concluded Barrington.
'Even in times of peace, thousands of people standing idle and tamely starving in their own
fertile country, because a few land "Lords" forbid them to cultivate it.'

'Is there any more questions?' demanded Philpot, breaking a prolonged silence.

'Would any Liberal or Tory capitalist like to get up into the pulpit and oppose the speaker?'
the chairman went on, finding that no one responded to his appeal for questions.

The silence continued.

'As there's no more questions and no one won't get up into the pulpit, it is now my painful
duty to call upon someone to move a resolution.'

'Well, Mr Chairman,' said Harlow, 'I may say that when I came on this firm I was a Liberal,
but through listenin' to several lectures by Professor Owen and attendin' the meetings on the
hill at Windley and reading the books and pamphlets I bought there and from Owen, I came to
the conclusion some time ago that it's a mug's game for us to vote for capitalists whether
they calls theirselves Liberals or Tories. They're all alike when you're workin' for 'em; I
defy any man to say what's the difference between a Liberal and a Tory employer.  There is
none--there can't be; they're both sweaters, and they've got to be, or they wouldn't be able
to compete with each other.  And since that's what they are, I say it's a mug's game for us
to vote 'em into Parliament to rule over us and to make laws that we've got to abide by whether
we like it or not. There's nothing to choose between 'em, and the proof of it is that it's
never made much difference to us which party was in or which was out. All these parr are food child
