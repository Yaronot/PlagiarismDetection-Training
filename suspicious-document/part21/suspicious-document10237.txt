LETTERS OF VOLUME III

LETTER I. Miss Howe to Clarissa.--Is astonished, confounded, aghast. Repeats her advice to
marry Lovelace.

LETTER II. Clarissa to Miss Howe.--Gives a particular account of her meeting Lovelace; of her
vehement contention with him; and, at last, of her being terrified out of her predetermined
resolution, and tricked away. Her grief and compunction of heart upon it. Lays all to the fault
of corresponding with him at first against paternal prohibition. Is incensed against him for
his artful dealings with her, and for his selfish love.

LETTER III. Mr. Lovelace to Joseph Leman.--A letter which lays open the whole of his contrivance
to get off Clarissa.

LETTER IV. Joseph Leman. In answer.

LETTER V. Lovelace to Belford.--In ecstasy on the success of his contrivances. Well as he loves
Clarissa, he would show her no mercy, if he thought she preferred any man living to him. Will
religiously observe the INJUNCTIONS she laid upon him previous to their meeting.

LETTER VI. Clarissa to Miss Howe.--A recriminating conversation between her and Lovelace. He
reminds her of her injunctions; and, instead of beseeching her to dispense with them, promises
a sacred regard to them. It is not, therefore, in her power, she tells Miss Howe, to take her
advice as to speedy marriage. [A note on the place, justifying her conduct.] Is attended by
Mrs. Greme, Lord M.'s housekeeper at The Lawn, who waits on her to her sister Sorlings, with
whom she consents to lodge. His looks offend her. Has written to her sister for her clothes.

LETTER VII. Lovelace to Belford.--Gives briefly the particulars of his success. Describes her
person and dress on her first meeting him. Extravagant exultation. Makes Belford question him
on the honour of his designs by her: and answers doubtfully.

LETTER VIII. Miss Howe to Clarissa.--Her sentiments on her narrative. Her mother, at the instigation
of Antony Harlowe, forbids their correspondence. Mr. Hickman's zeal to serve them in it. What
her family now pretend, if she had not left them. How they took her supposed projected flight.
Offers her money and clothes. Would have her seem to place some little confidence in Lovelace.
Her brother and sister will not permit her father and uncles to cool.

LETTER IX. X. Clarissa to Miss Howe.--Advises her to obey her mother, who prohibits their correspondence.
Declines to accept her offers of money: and why. Mr. Lovelace not a polite man. She will be
as ready to place a confidence in him, as he will be to deserve it. Yet tricked away by him
as she was, cannot immediately treat him with great complaisance. Blames her for her liveliness
to her mother. Encloses the copy of her letter to her sister.

LETTER XI. Lovelace to Belford.--Prides himself in his arts in the conversations between them.
Is alarmed at the superiority of her talents. Considers opposition and resistance as a challenge
to do his worst. His artful proceedings with Joseph Leman.

LETTER XII. From the same.--Men need only be known to be rakes, he says, to recommend themselves
to the favour of the sex. Wishes Miss Howe were not so well acquainted with Clarissa: and why.

LETTER XIII. From the same.--Intends to set old Antony at Mrs. Howe, to prevent the correspondence
between the two young ladies. Girl, not gold, his predominant passion. Rallies Belford on his
person and appearance. Takes humourous notice of the two daughters of the widow Sorlings.

LETTER XIV. From the same.--Farther triumphs over the Harlowes. Similitude of the spider and
fly. Is for having separate churches as well as separate boarding-schools for the sexes. The
women ought to love him, he says: and why. Prides himself that they do.

LETTER XV. Clarissa to Miss Howe.--Particulars of an angry conference with Lovelace. Seeing
her sincerely displeased, he begs the ceremony may immediately pass. He construes her bashful
silence into anger, and vows a sacred regard to her injunctions.

LETTER XVI. XVII. XVIII. Lovelace to Belford.--The pleasure of a difficult chace. Triumphs
in the distress and perplexity he gave her by his artful and parading offer of marriage. His
reasons for and against doing her justice. Resolves to try her to the utmost. The honour of
the whole sex concerned in the issue of her trial. Matrimony, he sees, is in his power, now she is.

LETTER XIX. Miss Howe to Clarissa.--Will not obey her mother in her prohibition of their correspondence:
and why. Is charmed with her spirit.

LETTER XX. Clarissa to Miss Howe.--Knows not what she can do with Lovelace. He may thank himself
for the trouble he has had on her account. Did she ever, she asks, make him any promises? Did
she ever receive him as a lover?

LETTER XXI. XXII. From the same.--She calls upon Lovelace to give her a faithful account of
the noise and voices she heard at the garden-door, which frightened her away with him. His
confession, and daring hints in relation to Solmes, and her brother, and Betty Barnes. She
is terrified.

LETTER XXIII. Lovelace to Belford.--Rejoices in the stupidity of the Harlowes. Exults in his
capacity for mischief. The condescensions to which he intends to bring the lady. Libertine
observations to the disadvantage of women; which may serve as cautions to the sex.

LETTER XXIV. Clarissa to Miss Howe.--A conversation with Mr. Lovelace wholly agreeable. His
promises of reformation. She remembers, to his advantage, his generosity to his Rosebud and
his tenants. Writes to her aunt Hervey.

LETTER XXV. XXVI. Lovelace to Belford.--His acknowledged vanity. Accounts for his plausible
behaviour, and specious promises and proposals. Apprehensive of the correspondence between
Miss Howe and Clarissa. Loves to plague him with out-of-the-way words and phrases.

LETTER XXVII. Miss Howe to Clarissa.--How to judge of Lovelace's suspicious proposals and promises.
Hickman devoted to their service. Yet she treats him with ridicule.

LETTER XXVIII. Clarissa to Miss Howe.--Lovelace complains, she hears, to Mrs. Greme, of her
adhering to her injunctions. What means he by it, she asks, yet forego such opportunities as
he had? She is punished for her vanity in hoping to be an example. Blames Miss Howe for her
behaviour to Hickman.

LETTER XXIX. From the same.--Warm dialogues with Lovelace. She is displeased with him for his
affectedly-bashful hints of matrimony. Mutual recriminations. He looks upon her as his, she
says, by a strange sort of obligation, for having run away with her against her will. Yet but
touches on the edges of matrimony neither. She is sick of herself.

LETTER XXX. From the same.--Mr. Lovelace a perfect Proteus. He now applauds her for that treatment
of him which before he had resented; and communicates to her two letters, one from Lady Betty
Lawrance, the other from Miss Montague. She wonders he did not produce those letters before,
as he must know they would be highly acceptable to her.

LETTER XXXI. XXXII. XXXIII. XXXIV. From the same.--The contents of the letters from Lady Betty
and Miss Montague put Clarissa in good humour with Mr. Lovelace. He hints at marriage; but
pretends to be afraid of pursuing the hint. She is earnest with him to leave her: and why.
He applauds her reasonings. Her serious questions, and his ludicrous answer.--He makes different
proposals.--He offers to bring Mrs. Norton to her. She is ready to blame herself for her doubts
of him: but gives reasons for her caution.--He writes by her consent to his friend Doleman,
to procure lodgings for her in town.

LETTER XXXV. Lovelace to Belford.--Glories in his contrivances. Gives an advantageous description
of Clarissa's behaviour. Exults on her mentioning London. None but impudent girls, he says,
should run away with a man. His farther views, plots, and designs.

LETTER XXXVI. Miss Howe to Clarissa.--Humourously touches on her reproofs in relation to Hickman.
Observations on smooth love. Lord M.'s family greatly admire her. Approves of her spirited
treatment of Lovelace, and of her going to London. Hints at the narrowness of her own mother.
Advises her to keep fair with Lovelace.

LETTER XXXVII. XXXVIII. Clarissa to Miss Howe.--Wonders not that her brother has weight to
make her father irreconcilable.--Copy of Mr. Doleman's answer about London lodgings. Her caution
in her choice of them. Lovelace has given her five guineas for Hannah. Other instances of his
considerateness. Not displeased with her present prospects.

LETTER XXXIX. Lovelace to Belford.--Explains what is meant by Doleman's answer about the lodgings.
Makes Belford object to his scheme, that he may answer the objections. Exults. Swells. Despises
every body. Importance of the minutiae. More of his arts, views, and contrivances.

LETTER XL. Miss Howe to Clarissa.--Acquaints her with a scheme formed by her brother and captain
Singleton, to carry her off. Hickman's silent charities. She despises all his sex, as well
as him. Ill terms on which her own father and mother lived. Extols Clarissa for her domestic
good qualities. Particulars of a great contest with her mother, on their correspondence. Has
been slapt by her. Observations on managing wives.

LETTER XLI. XLII. XLIII. Clarissa to Miss Howe.--A strong remonstrance on her behaviour to
her mother; in which she lays down the duty of children. Accuses her of want of generosity
to Hickman. Farther excuses herself on declining to accept of her money offers. Proposes a
condition on which Mrs. Howe may see all they write.

LETTER XLIV. Miss Howe to Clarissa.--Her mother rejects the proposed condition. Miss Howe takes
thankfully her reprehensions: but will continue the correspondence. Some excuses for herself.
Humourous story of game-chickens.

LETTER XLV. Clarissa to Miss Howe.--Lovelace communicates her brother's and Singleton's project;
but treats it with seeming contempt. She asks his advice what to do upon it. This brings on
an offer of marriage from him. How it went off.

LETTER XLVI. Lovelace to Belford.--He confesses his artful intentions in the offer of marriage:
yet had like, he says, to have been caught in his own snares.

LETTER XLVII. Joseph Leman to Mr. Lovelace.--With intelligence of a design formed against him
by the Harlowes. Joseph's vile hypocrisy and selfishness.

LETTER XLVIII. Lovelace. In answer.--Story of Miss Betterton. Boast of his treatment of his
mistresses. The artful use he makes of Joseph's intelligence.

LETTER XLIX. Clarissa to her aunt Hervey.--Complains of her silence. Hints at her not having
designed to go away with Lovelace. She will open her whole heart to her, if she encourage her
to do so, by the hopes of a reconciliation.

LETTER L. Miss Howe to Clarissa.--Observations on Lovelace's meanness, pride, and revenge.
Politeness not to be expected from him. She raves at him for the artful manner in which he
urges Clarissa to marry him. Advises her how to act in her present situation.

LETTER LI. Belford to Lovelace.--Becomes a warm advocate for the lady. Gives many instructive
reasons to enforce his arguments in her favour.

LETTER LII. Mrs. Hervey to Clarissa.--A severe and cruel letter in answer to her's, Letter
XLIX. It was not designed, she says, absolutely to force her to marry to her dislike.

LETTER LIII. Clarissa to Miss Howe.--Her deep regret on this intelligence, for having met Lovelace.
The finer sensibilities make not happy. Her fate too visibly in her power. He is unpolite,
cruel, insolent, unwise, a trifler in his own happiness. Her reasons why she less likes him
than ever. Her soul his soul's superior. Her fortitude. Her prayer.

LETTER LIV. LV. From the same.--Now indeed is her heart broken, she says. A solemn curse laid
upon her by her father. Her sister's barbarous letters on the occasion.

LETTER LVI. Miss Howe to Clarissa.--A letter full of generous consolation and advice. Her friendly
vow. Sends her fifty guineas in the leaves of a Norris's miscellanies.

LETTER LVII. Clarissa to Miss Howe.--A faithful friend the medicine of life. She is just setting
out for London. Lovelace has offered marriage to her in so unreserved a manner, that she wishes
she had never written with diffidence of him. Is sorry it was not in her power to comply with
his earnest solicitations. Returns her Norris: and why.

LETTER LVIII. LIX. Miss Howe to Clarissa.--Sorry she has returned her Norris. Wishes she had
accepted of Lovelace's unreserved offer of marriage. Believes herself to have a sneaking kindness
for Hickman: and why. She blames Mrs. Harlowe: and why.

In answer to Letter VIII. Clarissa states the difference in the characters of Mr. Lovelace
and Mr. Hickman; and tells her, that her motives for suspending marriage were not merely ceremonious
ones. Regrets Mrs. Howe's forbidding the correspondence between them. Her dutiful apology for
her own mother. Lesson to children.

LETTER LX. Lovelace to Belford.--Thinks he shall be inevitably manacled at last. The lady's
extreme illness. Her filial piety gives her dreadful faith in a father's curses. She lets not
Miss Howe know how very ill she was. His vows of marriage bring her back to life. Absolutely
in earnest in those vows. [The only time he was so.] He can now talk of love and marriage without
check. Descants upon Belford's letter, No. LI.

LETTER LXI. From the same.--Is setting out for London. A struggle with his heart. Owns it to
be a villain of a heart. A fit of strong, but transitory remorse. If he do marry, he doubts
he shall have a vapourish wife. Thinks it would be better for both not to marry. His libertine
reasons. Lessons to the sex.

LETTER LXII. From the same.--They arrive at Mrs. Sinclair's. Sally Martin and Polly Horton
set upon him. He wavers in his good purposes. Dorcas Wykes proposed, and reluctantly accepted
for a servant, till Hannah can come. Dorcas's character. He has two great points to carry.
What they are.

I write, because you enjoin me to do so. Love you still!--How can I help it, if I would? You
may believe how I stand aghast, your letter communicating the first news--Good God of Heaven
and Earth!--But what shall I say?--I am all impatient for particulars.

Lord have mercy upon me!--But can it be?

My mother will indeed be astonished!--How can I tell it her!--It was but last night (upon some
jealousies put into her head by your foolish uncle) that I assured her, and this upon the strength
of your own assurances, that neither man nor devil would be able to induce you to take a step
that was in the least derogatory to the most punctilious honour.

But, once more, can it be? What woman at this rate!--But, God preserve you!

Let nothing escape you in your letters. Direct them for me, however, to Mrs. Knolly's, till
further notice.

*****

Observe, my dear, that I don't blame you by all this--Your relations only are in fault!--Yet
how you came to change your mind is the surprising thing.

How to break it to my mother, I know not. Yet if she hear it first from any other, and find
I knew it before, she will believe it to be my connivance!--Yet, as I hope to live, I know
not how to break it to her.

But this is teasing you.--I am sure, without intention.

Let me now repeat my former advice--If you are not married by this time, be sure delay not
the ceremony. Since things are as they are, I wish it were thought that you were privately
married before you went away. If these men plead AUTHORITY to our pain, when we are theirs--Why
should we not, in such a case as this, make some good out of the hated word, for our reputation,
when we are induced to violate a more natural one?

Your brother and sister [that vexes me almost as much as any thing!] have now their ends. Now,
I suppose, will go forward alterations of wills, and such-like spiteful doings.

*****

Miss Lloyd and Miss Biddulph this moment send up their names. They are out of breath, Kitty
says, to speak to me--easy to guess their errand;--I must see my mother, before I see them.
I have no way but to shew her your letter to clear myself. I shall not be able to say a word,
till she has run herself out of her first breath.--Forgive me, my dear--surprise makes me write
thus. If your messenger did not wait, and were not those young ladies below, I could write
it over again, for fear of afflicting you.

I send what you write for. TUESDAY NIGHT.

I think myself obliged to thank you, my dear Miss Howe, for your condescension, in taking notice
of a creature who has occasioned you so much scandal.

I am grieved on this account, as much, I verily think, as for the evil itself.

Tell me--but yet I am afraid to know--what your mother said.

I long, and yet I dread, to be told, what the young ladies my companions, now never more perhaps
to be so, say of me.

They cannot, however, say worse of me than I will of myself. Self accusation shall flow in
every line of my narrative where I think I am justly censurable. If any thing can arise from
the account I am going to give you, for extenuation of my fault (for that is all a person can
hope for, who cannot excuse herself) I know I may expect it from your friendship, though not
from the charity of any other: since by this time I doubt not every mouth is opened against
me; and all that know Clarissa Harlowe condemn the fugitive daughter.

After I had deposited my letter to you, written down to the last hour, as I may say, I returned
to the ivy summer-house; first taking back my letter from the loose bricks: and there I endeavoured,
as coolly as my situation would permit, to recollect and lay together several incidents that
had passed between my aunt and me; and, comparing them with some of the contents of my cousin
Dolly's letter, I began to hope, that I needed not to be so very apprehensive as I have been
next Wednesday. And thus I argued with myself.

'Wednesday cannot possibly be the day they intend, although to intimidate me they may wish
me to think it is: for the settlements are unsigned: nor have they been offered me to sign.
I can choose whether I will or will not put my hand to them; hard as it will be to refuse if
my father and mother propose, if I made compulsion necessary, to go to my uncle's themselves
in order to be out of the way of my appeals? Whereas they intend to be present on Wednesday.
And, however affecting to me the thought of meeting them and all my friends in full assembly
is, perhaps it is the very thing I ought to wish for: since my brother and sister had such
an opinion of my interest in them, that they got me excluded from their presence, as a measure
which they thought previously necessary to carry on their designs.

'Nor have I reason to doubt, but that (as I had before argued with myself) I shall be able
to bring over some of my relations to my party; and, being brought face to face with my brother,
that I shall expose his malevolence, and of consequence weaken his power.

'Then supposing the very worst, challenging the minister as I shall challenge him, he will
not presume to proceed: nor surely will Mr. Solmes dare to accept my refusing and struggling
hand. And finally, if nothing else will do, nor procure me delay, I can plead scruples of conscience,
and even pretend prior obligation; for, my dear, I have give Mr. Lovelace room to hope (as
you will see in one of my letters in your hands) that I will be no other man's while he is
single, and gives me not wilful and premeditated cause of offence against him; and this in
order to rein-in his resentment on the declared animosity of my brother and uncles to him.
And as I shall appeal, or refer my scruples on this head, to the good Dr. Lewen, it is impossible
but that my mother and aunt (if nobody else) must be affected with this plea.'

Revolving cursorily these things, I congratulated myself, that I had resolved against going
away with Mr. Lovelace.

I told you, my dear, that I would not spare myself: and I enumerate these particulars as so
many arguments to condemn the actions I have been so unhappily betrayed into. An argument that
concludes against me with the greater force, as I must acknowledge, that I was apprehensive,
that what my cousin Dolly mentions as from Betty, and from my sister who told her, that she
should tell me, in order to make me desperate, and perhaps to push me upon some such step as
I have been driven to take, as the most effectual means to ruin me with my father and uncles.

God forgive me, if I judge too harshly of their views!--But if I do not, it follows, that they
laid a wicked snare for me; and that I have been caught in it.--And now they triumph, if they
can triumph, in the ruin of a sister, who never wished or intended to hurt them!

As the above kind of reasoning had lessened my apprehensions as to the Wednesday, it added
to those I had of meeting Mr. Lovelace--now, as it seemed, not only the nearest, but the heaviest
evil; principally indeed because nearest; for little did I dream (foolish creature that I was,
and every way beset!) of the event proving what it has proved. I expected a contention with
him, 'tis true, as he had not my letter: but I thought it would be very strange, as I mentioned
in one of my former,* if I, who had so steadily held out against characters so venerable, against
authorities so sacred, as I may say, when I thought them unreasonably exerted, should not find
myself more equal to such a trial as this; especially as I had so much reason to be displeased
with him for not having taken away my letter.

On what a point of time may one's worldly happiness depend! Had I but two hours more to consider
of the matter, and to attend to and improve upon these new lights, as I may call them--but
even then, perhaps, I might have given him a meeting.--Fool that I was! what had I to do to
give him hope that I would personally acquaint him with the reason for my change of mind, if
I did change it?

O my dear! an obliging temper is a very dangerous temper!--By endeavouring to gratify others,
it is evermore disobliging itself!

When the bell rang to call the servants to dinner, Betty came to me and asked, if I had any
commands before she went to hers; repeating her hint, that she should be employed; adding,
that she believed it was expected that I should not come up till she came down, or till I saw
my aunt or Miss Hervey.

I asked her some questions about the cascade, which had been out of order, and lately mended;
and expressed a curiosity to see how it played, in order to induce her [how cunning to cheat
myself, as it proved!] to go thither, if she found me not where she left me; it being a part
of the garden most distant from the ivy summer-house.

She could hardly have got into the house when I heard the first signal--O how my heart fluttered!--but
no time was to be lost. I stept to the garden-door; and seeing a clear coast, unbolted the
already-unlocked door--and there was he, all impatience, waiting for me.

A panic next to fainting seized me when I saw him. My heart seemed convulsed; and I trembled
so, that I should hardly have kept my feet, had he not supported me.

Fear nothing, dearest creature, said he--let us hasten away--the chariot is at hand--and, by
this sweet condescension, you have obliged me beyond expression or return.

Recovering my spirits a little, as he kept drawing me after him, O Mr. Lovelace, said I, I
cannot go with you--indeed I cannot--I wrote you word so--let go my hand, and you shall see
my letter. It is lain there from yesterday morning, till within this half-hour. I bid you watch
to the last for a letter from me, lest I should be obliged to revoke the appointment; and,
had you followed the direction, you would have found it.

I have been watched, my dearest life, said he, half out of breath--I have been watched in every
step I took: and my trusty servant has been watched too, ever since Saturday; and dared not
to come near your wall. And here we shall be discovered in a moment.--Speed away, my charmer--this
is the moment of your deliverance--if you neglect this opportunity, you can never have such
another.

What is it you mean, Sir?--Let go my hand: for I tell you [struggling vehemently] that I will
sooner die than go with you.

Good God! said he, with a look of wildness and surprise, what is it I hear?--But [still drawing
me after him, as he retreated farther from the door] it is no time to argue--by all that's
good you must go--surely you cannot doubt my honour, nor give me cause to question your own.

As you value me, Mr. Lovelace, urge me no farther. I come fixed and resolved. Let me give you
the letter I have written. My further reasons shall follow; and they will convince you that
I ought not to go.

Nothing, Madam, can convince me--by all that's sacred, I will not leave you. To leave you now,
would be to lose you for ever--

Am I to be thus compelled? interrupted I, with equal indignation and vehemence.--Let go my
hands--I am resolved not to go with you--and I will convince you that I ought not.

All my friends expect you, Madam--all your own are determined against you--Wednesday next is
the day, the important, perhaps the fatal day! Would you stay to be Solmes's wife?--Can this
be your determination at last?

No, never, never will I be that man's--But I will not go with you! [draw me not thus--How dare
you, Sir? I would not have seen you, but to tell you so]. I had not met you, but for fear you
would have been guilty of some rashness--and, once more, I will not go--What mean you?--striving
with all my force to get from him.

What can have possessed my angel, said he [quitting my hands, and with a gentler voice] that
after so much ill-usage from your relations; vows so solemn on my part; an affection so ardent;
you stab me with a refusal to stand by your own appointment?

We have no time to talk, Mr. Lovelace. I will give you my reasons at a better opportunity.
I cannot go with you now--and once more urge me no farther--surely, I am not to be compelled
by every body!

I see how it is, said he, with a dejected but passionate air--What a severe fate is mine!--At
length your spirit is subdued!--Your brother and sister have prevailed; and I must give up
all my hopes to a wretch so truly despicable--

Once more I tell you, interrupted I, I never will be his--all may end on Wednesday differently
from what you expect--

And it may not!--And then, good heavens!

It is to be their last effort, as I have reason to believe--

And I have reason to believe so too--since if you stay, you will inevitably be Solmes's wife.

Not so, interrupted I--I have obliged them in one point. They will be in good-humour with me.
I shall gain time at least. I am sure I shall. I have several ways to gain time.

And what, Madam, will gaining time do? It is plain you have not a hope beyond that--it is plain
you have not, by putting all upon that precarious issue. O my dearest, dearest life, let me
beseech you not to run a risque of this consequence. I can convince you that it will be more
than a risque if you go back, that you will on Wednesday next be Solmes's wife.--Prevent, therefore,
now that it is in your power to prevent, the fatal mischief that will follow such a dreadful
certainty.

While I have any room for hope, it concerns your honour, Mr. Lovelace, as well as mine, (if
you have the value for me you pretend, and wish me to believe you,) that my conduct in this
great point should justify my prudence.

Your prudence, Madam! When has that been questionable? Yet what stead has either your prudence
or your duty stood you in, with people so strangely determined?

And then he pathetically enumerated the different instances of the harsh treatment I had met
with; imputing all to the malice and caprice of a brother, who set every body against him:
and insisting, that I had no other way to bring about a reconciliation with my father and uncles,
than by putting myself out of the power of my brother's inveterate malice.

Your brother's whole reliance, proceeded he, has been upon your easiness to bear his insults.
Your whole family will seek to you, when you have freed yourself from this disgraceful oppression.
When they know you are with those who can and will right you, they will give up to you your
own estate. Why then, putting his arms around me, and again drawing me with a gentle force
after him, do you hesitate a moment?--Now is the time--Fly with me, then, I beseech you, my
dearest creature! Trust your persecuted adorer. Have we not suffered in the same cause? If
any imputations are cast upon you, give me the honour (as I shall be found to deserve it) to
call you mine; and, when you are so, shall I not be able to protect both your person and character?

Urge me no more, Mr. Lovelace, I conjure you. You yourself have given me a hint, which I will
speak plainer to, than prudence, perhaps, on any other occasion, would allow. I am convinced,
that Wednesday next (if I had time I would give you my reasons) is not intended to be the day
we had both so much dreaded: and if after that day shall be over, I find my friends determined
in Mr. Solmes's favour, I will then contrive some way to meet you with Miss Howe, who is not
your enemy: and when the solemnity has passed, I shall think that step a duty, which till then
will be criminal to take: since now my father's authority is unimpeached by any greater.

Dearest Madam--

Nay, Mr. Lovelace, if you now dispute--if, after this more favourable declaration, than I had
the thought of making, you are not satisfied, I shall know what to think both of your gratitude
and generosity.

The case, Madam, admits not of this alternative. I am all gratitude upon it. I cannot express
how much I should be delighted with the charming hope you have given me, were you not next
Wednesday, if you stay, to be another man's. Think, dearest creature! what an heightening of
my anguish the distant hope you bid me look up to is, taken in this light!

Depend, depend upon it, I will die sooner than be Mr. Solmes's. If you would have me rely upon
your honour, why should you doubt of mine?

I doubt not your honour, Madam; your power is all I doubt. You never, never can have such another
opportunity.--Dearest creature, permit me--and he was again drawing me after him.

Whither, Sir, do you draw me?--Leave me this moment--Do you seek to keep me till my return
shall grow dangerous or impracticable? This moment let me go, if you would have me think tolerably
of you.

My happiness, Madam, both here and hereafter, and the safety of all your implacable family,
depend upon this moment.

To Providence, Mr. Lovelace, and to the law, will I leave the safety of my friends. You shall
not threaten me into a rashness that my heart condemns!--Shall I, to promote your happiness,
as you call it, depend upon future peace of mind?

You trifle with me, my dear life, just as our better prospects begin to open. The way is clear;
just now it is clear; but you may be prevented in a moment. What is it you doubt?--May I perish
eternally, if your will shall not be a law to me in every thing! All my relations expect you.--Next
Wednesday!--Dearest creature! think of next Wednesday!--And to what is it I urge you, but to
take a step that sooner than any other will reconcile you to all whom you have most reason
to value in your family?

Let my judge for myself, Sir. Do not you, who blame my friends for endeavouring to compel me,
yourself seek to compel. I won't bear it. Your earnestness gives me greater apprehensions,
and greater reluctance. Let me go back, then--let me, before it is too late, go back, that
it may not be worse for both--What mean you by this forcible treatment? Is it thus that I am
to judge of the entire submission to my will which you have so often vowed?--Unhand me this
moment, or I will cry out for help.

I will obey you, my dearest creature!--And quitted my hand with a look full of tender despondency,
that, knowing the violence of his temper, half-concerned me for him. Yet I was hastening from
him, when, with a solemn air, looking upon his sword, but catching, as it were, his hand from
it, he folded both his arms, as if a sudden thought had recovered him from an intended rashness.

Stay, one moment--but one moment stay, O best beloved of my soul!--Your retreat is secure,
if you will go: the key lies at the door.--But, O Madam, next Wednesday, and you are Mr. Solmes's!--Fly
me not so eagerly--hear me but a few words.

When near the garden-door, I stopped; and was the more satisfied, as I saw the key there, by
which I could let myself in again at pleasure. But, being uneasy lest I should be missed, I
told him, I could stay no longer. I had already staid too long. I would write to him all my
reasons. And depend upon it, Mr. Lovelace, said I [just upon the point of stooping for the
key, in order to return] I will die, rather than have that man. You know what I have promised,
if I find myself in danger.

One word, Madam, however; one word more [approaching me, his arms still folded, as if, I thought,
he would not be tempted to mischief]. Remember only, that I come at your appointment, to redeem
you, at the hazard of my life, from your gaolers and persecutors, with a resolution, God is
my witness, or may he for ever blast me! [that was his shocking imprecation] to be a father,
uncle, brother, and, as I humbly hoped, in your own good time, a husband to you, all in one.
But since I find you are so ready to cry out for help against me, which must bring down upon
me the vengeance of all your family, I am contented to run all risques. I will not ask you
to retreat with me; I will attend you into the garden, and into the house, if I am not intercepted.

Nay, be not surprised, Madam. The help you would have called for, I will attend you to; for
I will face them all: but not as a revenger, if they provoke me not too much. You shall see
what I can further bear for your sake--and let us both see, if expostulation, and the behaviour
of a gentleman to them, will not procure me the treatment due to a gentleman from them.

Had he offered to draw his sword upon himself, I was prepared to have despised him for supposing
me such a poor novice, as to be intimidated by an artifice so common. But this resolution,
uttered with so serious an air, of accompanying me in to my friends, made me gasp with terror.

What mean you, Mr. Lovelace? said I: I beseech you leave me--leave me, Sir, I beseech you.

Excuse me, Madam! I beg you to excuse me. I have long enough skulked like a thief about these
lonely walls--long, too long, have I borne the insults of your brother, and other of your relations.
Absence but heightens malice. I am desperate. I have but this one chance for it; for is not
the day after to-morrow Wednesday? I have encouraged virulence by my tameness.--Yet tame I
will still be. You shall see, Madam, what I will bear for your sake. My sword shall be put
sheathed into your hands [and he offered it to me in the scabbard].--My heart, if you please,
clapping one hand upon his breast, shall afford a sheath for your brother's sword. Life is
nothing, if I lose you--be pleased, Madam, to shew me the way into the garden [moving toward
the door]. I will attend you, though to my fate!--But too happy, be it what it will, if I receive
it in your presence. Lead on, dear creature! [putting his sword into his belt]--You shall see
what I can bear for you. And he stooped and took up the key; and offered it to the lock; but
dropped it again, without opening the door, upon my earnest expostulations.

What can you mean, Mr. Lovelace?--said I--Would you thus expose yourself? Would you thus expose
me?--Is this your generosity? Is every body to take advantage thus of the weakness of my temper?

And I wept. I could not help it.

He threw himself upon his knees at my feet--Who can bear, said he, [with an ardour that could
not be feigned, his own eyes glistening,] who can bear to behold such sweet emotion?--O charmer
of my heart, [and, respectfully still kneeling, he took my hand with both his, pressing it
to his lips,] command me with you, command me from you; in every way I am implicit to obedience--but
I appeal to all you know of your relations' cruelty to you, their determined malice against
me, and as determined favour to the man you tell me you hate, (and, O Madam, if you did not
hate him, I should hardly think there would be a merit in your approbation, place it where
you would)--I appeal to every thing you know, to all you have suffered, whether you have not
reason to be apprehensive of that Wednesday, which is my terror!--whether you can possibly
have another opportunity--the chariot ready: my friends with impatience expecting the result
of your own appointment: a man whose will shall be entirely your will, imploring you, thus,
on his knees, imploring you--to be your own mistress; that is all: nor will I ask for your
favour, but as upon full proof I shall appear to deserve it. Fortune, alliance, unobjectionable!--O
my beloved creature! pressing my hand once more to his lips, let not such an opportunity slip.
You never, never will have such another.

I bid him rise. He arose; and I told him, that were I not thus unaccountably hurried by his
impatience, I doubted not to convince him, that both he and I had looked upon next Wednesday
with greater apprehension than was necessary. I was proceeding to give him my reasons; but
he broke in upon me--

Had I, Madam, but the shadow of a probability to hope what you hope, I would be all obedience
and resignation. But the license is actually got: the parson is provided: the pedant Brand
is the man. O my dearest creature, do these preparations mean only a trial?

You know not, Sir, were the worst to be intended, and weak as you think me, what a spirit I
have: you know not what I can do, and how I can resist when I think myself meanly or unreasonably
dealt with: nor do you know what I have already suffered, what I have already borne, knowing
to whose unbrotherly instigations all is to be ascribed--

I may expect all things, Madam, interrupted he, from the nobleness of your mind. But your spirits
may fail you. What may not be apprehended from the invincible temper of a father so positive,
to a daughter so dutiful?--Fainting will not save you: they will not, perhaps, be sorry for
such an effect of their barbarity. What will signify expostulations against a ceremony performed?
Must not all, the dreadful all follow, that is torture to my heart but to think of? Nobody
to appeal to, of what avail will your resistance be against the consequences of a rite witnessed
to by the imposers of it, and those your nearest relations?

I was sure, I said, of procuring a delay at least. Many ways I had to procure a delay. Nothing
could be so fatal to us both, as for me now to be found with him. My apprehensions on this
score, I told him, grew too strong for my heart. I should think very hardly of him, if he sought
to detain me longer. But his acquiescence should engage my gratitude.

And then stooping to take up the key to let myself into the garden, he started, and looked
as if he had heard somebody near the door, on the inside; clapping his hand on his sword.

This frighted me so, that I thought I should have sunk down at his feet. But he instantly re-assured
me: He thought, he said, he had heard a rustling against the door: but had it been so, the
noise would have been stronger. It was only the effect of his apprehension for me.

And then taking up the key, he presented it to me.--If you will go, Madam--Yet, I cannot, cannot
leave you!--I must enter the garden with you--forgive me, but I must enter the garden with you.

And will you, will you thus ungenerously, Mr. Lovelace, take advantage of my fears? of my wishes
to prevent mischief? I, vain fool, to be concerned for every one; nobody for me!

Dearest creature! interrupted he, holding my hand, as I tremblingly offered to put the key
to the lock--let me, if you will go, open the door. But once more, consider, could you possibly
obtain that delay which seems to be your only dependence, whether you may not be closer confined?
I know they have already had that in consideration. Will you not, in this case, be prevented
from corresponding either with Miss Howe, or with me?--Who then shall assist you in your escape,
if escape you would?--From your chamber-window only permitted to view the garden you must not
enter into, how will you wish for the opportunity you now have, if your hatred to Solmes continue!--But
alas! that cannot continue. If you go back, it must be from the impulses of a yielding (which
you'll call, a dutiful) heart, tired and teased out of your own will.

I have no patience, Sir, to be thus constrained. Must I never be at liberty to follow my own
judgment? Be the consequence what it may, I will not be thus constrained.

And then, freeing my hand, I again offered the key to the door.

Down the ready kneeler dropt between me and that: And can you, can you, Madam, once more on
my knees let me ask you, look with an indifferent eye upon the evils that may follow? Provoked
as I have been, and triumphed over as I shall be, if your brother succeeds, my own heart shudders,
at times, at the thoughts of what must happen: And can yours be unconcerned? Let me beseech
you, dearest creature, to consider all these things; and lose not this only opportunity. My
intelligence--

Never, Mr. Lovelace, interrupted I, give so much credit to the words of a traitor. Your base
intelligencer is but a servant. He may pretend to know more than he has grounds for, in order
to earn the wages of corruption. You know not what contrivances I can find out.

I was once more offering the key to the lock, when, starting from his knees, with a voice of
affrightment, loudly whispering, and as if out of breath, they are at the door, my beloved
creature! and taking the key from me, he fluttered with it, as if he would double lock it.
And instantly a voice from within cried out, bursting against the door, as if to break it open,
the person repeating his violent pushes, Are you there?--come up this moment!--this moment!--here
they are--here they are both together!--your pistol this moment!--your gun!--Then another push,
and another. He at the same moment drew his sword, and clapping it naked under his arm, took
both my trembling hands in his; and drawing me swiftly after him, Fly, fly, my charmer; this
moment is all you have for it, said he.--Your brother!--your uncles!--or this Solmes!--they
will instantly burst the door--fly, my dearest life, if you would not be more cruelly used
than ever--if you would not see two or three murders committed at your feet, fly, fly, I beseech
you.

O Lord:--help, help, cried the fool, all in amaze and confusion, frighted beyond the power
of controuling.

Now behind me, now before me, now on this side, now on that, turned I my affrighted face, in
the same moment; expecting a furious brother here, armed servants there, an enraged sister
screaming, and a father armed with terror in his countenance more dreadful than even the drawn
sword which I saw, or those I apprehended. I ran as fast as he; yet knew not that I ran; my
fears adding wings to my feet, at the same time that they took all power of thinking from me--my
fears, which probably would not have suffered me to know what course to take, had I not had
him to urge and draw me after him: especially as I beheld a man, who must have come out of
the door, keeping us in his eye, running now towards us; then back to the garden; beckoning
and calling to others, whom I supposed he saw, although the turning of the wall hindered me
from seeing them; and whom I imagined to be my brother, my father, and their servants.

Thus terrified, I was got out of sight of the door in a very few minutes: and then, although
quite breathless between running and apprehension, he put my arm under his, his drawn sword
in the other hand, and hurried me on still faster: my voice, however, contradicting my action;
crying, no, no, no, all the while; straining my neck to look back, as long as the walls of
the garden and park were within sight, and till he brought me to the chariot: where, attending,
were two armed servants of his own, and two of Lord M.'s on horseback.

Here I must suspend my relation for a while: for now I am come to this sad period of it, my
indiscretion stares me in the face; and my shame and my grief give me a compunction that is
more poignant methinks than if I had a dagger in my heart. To have it to reflect, that I should
so inconsiderately give in to an interview, which, had I known either myself or him, or in
the least considered the circumstances of the case, I might have supposed would put me into
the power of his resolution, and out of that of my own reason.

For, might I not have believed, that he, who thought he had cause to apprehend that he was
on the point of losing a person who had cost him so much pains and trouble, would not hinder
her, if possible, from returning? That he, who knew I had promised to give him up for ever,
if insisted as a condition of reconciliation, would not endeavour to put it out of my power
to do so? In short, that he, who had artfully forborne to send for my letter, (for he could
not be watched, my dear,) lest he should find in it a countermand to my appointment, (as I
myself could apprehend, although I profited by the apprehension,) would want a device to keep
me with him till the danger of having our meeting discovered might throw me absolutely into
his power, to avoid my own worse usage, and the mischiefs which might have ensued (perhaps
in my very sight) had my friends and he met?

But if it shall come out, that the person within the garden was his corrupted implement, employed
to frighten me away with him, do you think, my dear, that I shall not have reason to hate him
and myself still more? I hope his heart cannot be so deep and so vile a one: I hope it cannot!
But how came it to pass, that one man could get out at the garden-door, and no more? how, that
that man kept aloof, as it were, and pursued us not; nor ran back to alarm the house? my fright,
and my distance, would not let me be certain; but really this man, as I now recollect, had
the air of that vile Joseph Leman.

O why, why, my dear friends!--But wherefore blame I them, when I had argued myself into a hope,
not improbable, that even the dreadful trial I was to undergo so soon might turn out better
than if I had been directly carried away from the presence of my once indulgent parents, who
might possibly intend that trial to be the last I should have had?

Would to Heaven, that I had stood it, however! then if I had afterwards done, what now I have
been prevailed upon, or perhaps foolishly frightened to do, I should not have been stung so
much by inward reproach as now I am: and this would have been a great evil avoided.

You know, my dear, that your Clarissa's mind was ever above justifying her own failings by
those of others. God forgive those of my friends who have acted cruelly by me! But their faults
are their own, and not excuses for mine. And mine began early: for I ought not to have corresponded
with him.

O the vile encroacher! how my indignation, at times, rises at him! thus to lead a young creature
(too much indeed relying upon her own strength) from evil to evil!--This last evil, although
the remote, yet sure consequence of my first--my prohibited correspondence! by a father early
prohibited.

How much more properly had I acted, with regard to that correspondence, had I, once for all,
when he was forbidden to visit me, and I to receive his visits, pleaded the authority by which
I ought to have been bound, and denied to write to him!--But I thought I could proceed, or
stop, as I pleased. I supposed it concerned me, more than any other, to be the arbitress of
the quarrels of unruly spirits.--And now I find my presumption punished--punished, as other
sins frequently are, by itself!

As to this last rashness; now, that it is too late, I plainly see how I ought to have conducted
myself. As he knew I had but one way of transmitting to him the knowledge of what befel me;
as he knew that my fate was upon a crisis with my friends; and that I had in my letter to him
reserved the liberty of revocation; I should not have been solicitous whether he had got my
letter or not: when he had come, and found I did not answer to his signal, he would presently
have resorted to the loose bricks, and there been satisfied, by the date of my letter, that
it was his own fault that he had it not before. But, governed by the same pragmatical motives
which induced me to correspond with him at first, I was again afraid, truly, with my foolish
and busy prescience; and the disappointment would have thrown him into the way of receiving
fresh insults from the same persons; which might have made him guilty of some violence to them.
And so to save him an apprehended rashness, I rushed into a real one myself. And what vexes
me more is, that it is plain to me now, by all his behaviour, that he had as great a confidence
in my weakness, as I had in my own strength. And so, in a point entirely relative to my honour,
he has triumphed; for he has not been mistaken in me, while I have in myself!

Tell me, my dear Miss Howe, tell me truly, if your unbiassed heart does not despise me?--It
must! for your mind and mine were ever one; and I despise myself!--And well I may: For could
the giddiest and most inconsiderate girl in England have done worse than I shall appear to
have done in the eye of the world? Since my crime will be known without the provocations, and
without the artifices of the betrayer too; while it will be a high aggravation, that better
things were expected from me than from many others.

You charge me to marry the first opportunity--Ah! my dear! another of the blessed effects of
my folly--That's as much in my power now as--as I am myself!--And can I besides give a sanction
immediately to his deluding arts?--Can I avoid being angry with him for tricking me thus, as
I may say, (and as I have called it to him,) out of myself?--For compelling me to take a step
so contrary to all my resolutions and assurances given to you; a step so dreadfully inconvenient
to myself; so disgraceful and so grievous (as it must be) to my dear mother, were I to be less
regardful of any other of my family or friends?--You don't know, nor can you imagine, my dear,
how I am mortified!--How much I am sunk in my own opinion! I, that was proposed for an example,
truly, to others!--O that I were again in my father's house, stealing down with a letter to
you; my heart beating with expectation of finding one from you!

*****

This is the Wednesday morning I dreaded so much, that I once thought of it as the day of my
doom: but of the Monday, it is plain, I ought to have been most apprehensive. Had I staid,
and had the worst I dreaded happened, my friends would then have been answerable for the consequences,
if any bad ones had followed:--but now, I have only this consolation left me (a very poor one,
you'll say!) that I have cleared them of blame, and taken it all upon myself!

You will not wonder to see this narrative so dismally scrawled. It is owing to different pens
and ink, all bad, and written in snatches of time; my hand trembling too with fatigue and grief.

I will not add to the length of it, by the particulars of his behaviour to me, and of our conversation
at St. Alban's, and since; because those will come in course in the continuation of my story;
which, no doubt, you will expect from me.

Only thus much will I say, that he is extremely respectful (even obsequiously so) at present,
though I am so much dissatisfied with him and myself that he has hitherto had no great cause
to praise my complaisance to him. Indeed, I can hardly, at times, bear the seducer in my sight.

The lodgings I am in are inconvenient. I shall not stay in them: so it signifies nothing to
tell you how to direct to me hither. And where my next may be, as yet I know not.

He knows that I am writing to you; and has offered to send my letter, when finished, by a servant
of his. But I thought I could not be too cautious, as I am now situated, in having a letter
of this importance conveyed to you. Who knows what such a man may do? So very wicked a contriver!
The contrivance, if a contrivance, to get me away, so insolently mean!--But I hope it is not
a contrivance neither!--Yet, be that as it will, I must say, that the best of him, and of my
prospects with him, are bad; and yet, having enrolled myself among the too-late repenters,
who shall pity me?

Nevertheless, I will dare to hope for a continued interest in your affections [I shall be miserable
indeed if I may not!] and to be remembered in your daily prayers. For neither time nor accident
shall ever make me cease to be

Your faithful and affectionate CLARISSA HARLOWE.

LETTER III

MR. LOVELACE, TO JOSEPH LEMAN SAT. APRIL 8.

HONEST JOSEPH,

At length your beloved young lady has consented to free herself from the cruel treatment she
has so long borne. She is to meet me without the garden-door at about four o'clock on Monday
afternoon. I told you she had promised to do so. She has confirmed her promise. Thank Heaven
she has confirmed her promise!

I shall have a chariot-and-six ready in the by-road fronting the private path to Harlowe-paddock;
and several of my friends and servants not far off, armed to protect her, if there be occasion:
but every one charged to avoid mischief. That, you know, has always been my principal care.

All my fear is, that, when she comes to the point, the over-niceness of her principles will
make her waver, and want to go back: although her honour is my honour, you know, and mine is
her's. If she should, and should I be unable to prevail upon her, all your past services will
avail nothing, and she will be lost to me for ever: the prey then of that cursed Solmes, whose
vile stinginess will never permit him to do good to any of the servants of the family.

I have no doubt of your fidelity, honest Joseph; nor of your zeal to serve an injured gentleman,
and an oppressed young lady. You see by the confidence I repose in you, that I have not; more
particularly, on this very important occasion, in which your assistance may crown the work:
for, if she waver, a little innocent contrivance will be necessary.

Be very mindful, therefore, of the following directions; take them into your heart. This will
probably be your last trouble, until my beloved and I are joined in holy wedlock: and then
we will be sure to take care of you. You know what I have promised. No man ever reproached
me for breach of word.

These, then, honest Joseph, are they:

Contrive to be in the garden, in disguise, if possible, and unseen by your young lady. If you
find the garden-door unbolted, you will know that she and I are together, although you should
not see her go out at it. It will be locked, but my key shall be on the ground just without
the door, that you may open it with your's, as it may be needful.

If you hear our voices parleying, keep at the door till I cry Hem, hem, twice: but be watchful
for this signal; for I must not hem very loud, lest she should take it for a signal. Perhaps,
in struggling to prevail upon the dear creature, I may have an opportunity to strike the door
hard with my elbow, or heel, to confirm you--then you are to make a violent burst against the
door, as if you would break it open, drawing backward and forward the bolt in a hurry: then,
with another push, but with more noise than strength, lest the lock give way, cry out (as if
you saw some of the family) Come up, come up, instantly!--Here they are! Here they are!--Hasten!--This
instant! hasten! And mention swords, pistols, guns, with as terrible a voice as you can cry
out with. Then shall I prevail upon her, no doubt, if loth before, to fly. If I cannot, I will
enter the garden with her, and the house too, be the consequence what it will. But, so affrighted,
these is no question but she will fly.

When you think us at a sufficient distance [and I shall raise my voice urging her swifter flight,
that you may guess at that] then open the door with your key: but you must be sure to open
it very cautiously, lest we should not be far enough off. I would not have her know you have
a hand in this matter, out of my great regard to you.

When you have opened the door, take your key out of the lock, and put it in your pocket: then,
stooping for mine, put it in the lock on the inside, that it may appear as if the door was
opened by herself, with a key, which they will suppose to be of my procuring (it being new)
and left open by us.

They should conclude she is gone off by her own consent, that they may not pursue us: that
they may see no hopes of tempting her back again. In either case, mischief might happen, you know.

But you must take notice, that you are only to open the door with your key, in case none of
the family come up to interrupt us, and before we are quite gone: for, if they do, you'll find
by what follows, that you must not open the door at all. Let them, on breaking it open, or
by getting over the wall, find my key on the ground, if they will.

If they do not come to interrupt us, and if you, by help of your key, come out, follow us at
a distance; and, with uplifted hands, and wild impatient gestures, (running backward and forward,
for fear you should come up too near us, and as if you saw somebody coming to your assistance,)
cry out for help, help, and to hasten. Then shall we be soon at the chariot.

Tell the family that you saw me enter a chariot with her: a dozen, or more, men on horseback,
attending us; all armed; some with blunderbusses, as you believe; and that we took quite the
contrary way to that we should take.

You see, honest Joseph, how careful I am, as well as you, to avoid mischief.

Observe to keep at such a distance that she may not discover who you are. Take long strides,
to alter your gait; and hold up your head, honest Joseph; and she'll not know it to be you.
Men's airs and gaits are as various and peculiar as their faces. Pluck a stake out of one of
the hedges: and tug at it, though it may come easy: this, if she turn back, will look terrible,
and account for your not following us faster. Then, returning with it, shouldered, to brag
to the family what you would have done, could you have overtaken us, rather than your young
lady should be carried off by such a ------ And you may call me names, and curse me. And these
airs will make you look valiant, and in earnest. You see, honest Joseph, I am always contriving
to give you reputation. No man suffers by serving me.

But, if our parley should last longer than I wish; and if any of her friends miss her before
I cry, Hem, hem, twice; then, in order to save yourself, (which is a very great point with
me, I assure you,) make the same noise as above: but as I directed before, open not the door
with your key. On the contrary, wish for a key with all your heart; but for fear any of them
should by accident have a key about them, keep in readiness half a dozen little gravel-stones,
no bigger than peas, and thrust two or three slily into the key-hole; which will hinder their
key from turning round. It is good, you know, Joseph, to provide against every accident in
such an important case, as this. And let this be your cry, instead of the other, if any of
my enemies come in your sight, as you seem to be trying to burst the door open, Sir! Sir! or
Madam! Madam! O Lord, hasten! O Lord, hasten! Mr. Lovelace! Mr. Lovelace!--And very loud--and
that shall quicken me more than it shall those you call to.--If it be Betty, and only Betty,
I shall think worse of your art of making love* than of your fidelity, if you can't find a
way to amuse her, and put her upon a false scent.

     * See Vol.II. Letter XXIX.

You must tell them that your young lady seemed to run as fast off with me as I with her. This
will also confirm to them that all pursuit is in vain. An end will hereby be put to Solmes's
hopes: and her friends, after a while, will be more studious to be reconciled to her than to
get her back. So you will be a happy instrument of great good to all round. And this will one
day be acknowledged by both families. You will then be every one's favourite; and every good
servant, for the future, will be proud to be likened to honest Joseph Leman.

If she should guess at you, or find you out, I have it already in my head to write a letter
for you to copy,* which, occasionally produced, will set you right with her.

     * See Vol.III. Letter XXI.

This one time be diligent, be careful: this will be the crown of all: and once more, depend,
for a recompense, upon the honour of

Your assured friend, R. LOVELACE.

You need not be so much afraid of going too far with Betty. If you should make a match with
her, she is a very likely creature, though a vixen, as you say. I have an admirable receipt
to cure a termagant wife.--Never fear, Joseph, but thou shalt be master of thine house. If
she be very troublesome, I can teach thee how to break her heart in a twelvemonth; and honestly
too;--or the precept would not be mine.

I enclose a new earnest of my future favour.

LETTER IV

TO ROBERT LOVELACE, ESQUIER, HIS HONNER SUNDAY MORNING, APRIL 9.

HONNERED SIR,

I must confesse I am infinitely obliged to your Honner's bounty. But this last command!--It
seems so intricket! Lord be merciful to me, how have I been led from littel stepps to grate
stepps!--And if I should be found out!--But your Honner says you will take me into your Honner's
sarvise, and protect me, if as I should at any time be found out; and raise my wages besides;
or set me upp in a good inne; which is my ambishion. And you will be honnerable and kind to
my dearest young lady, God love her.--But who can be unkind to she?

I wil do my best I am able, since your Honner will be apt to lose her, as your Honner says,
if I do not; and a man so stingie will be apt to gain her. But mayhap my deareste young lady
will not make all this trubble needful. If she has promissed, she will stand to it, I dare to say.

I love your Honner for contriveing to save mischiff so well. I thought till I know'd your Honner,
that you was verry mischevous, and plese your Honner: but find it to be clene contrary. Your
Honner, it is plane, means mighty well by every body, as far as I see. As I am sure I do myself;
for I am, althoff a very plane man, and all that, a very honnest one, I thank my God. And have
good principels, and have kept my young lady's pressepts always in mind: for she goes no where,
but saves a soul or two, more or less.

So, commending myself to your Honner's further favour, not forgetting the inne, when your Honner
shall so please, and good one offers; for plases are no inherritanses now-a-days. And, I hope,
your Honner will not think me a dishonest man for sarving your Honner agenst my duty, as it
may look; but only as my conshence clears me.

Be pleased, howsomever, if it like your Honner, not to call me honest Joseph, so often. For,
althoff I think myself verry honnest, and all that, yet I am touched a littel, for fear I should
not do the quite right thing: and too besides, your Honner has such a fesseshious way with
you, as that I hardly know whether you are in jest or earnest, when your Honner calls me honnest
so often.

I am a very plane man, and seldom have writ to such honourable gentlemen; so you will be good
enuff to pass by every thing, as I have often said, and need not now say over again.

As to Mrs. Betty; I tho'te, indeed, she looked above me. But she comes on vere well, natheless.
I could like her better, iff she was better to my young lady. But she has too much wit for
so plane a man. Natheless, if she was to angre me, althoff it is a shame to bete a woman, yet
I colde make shift to throe my hat at her, or so, your Honner.

But that same reseit, iff your Honner so please, to cure a shrewish wife. It would more encurrege
to wed, iff so be one know'd it before-hand, as one may say. So likewise, if one knoed one
could honnestly, as your Honner says, and as of the handy-work of God, in one twelvemonth--

But, I shall grow impertinent to such a grate man.--And hereafter may do for that, as she turnes
out: for one mought be loth to part with her, mayhap, so verry soon too; espessially if she
was to make the notable landlady your Honner put into my head.

Butt wonce moer, begging your Honner's parden, and promissing all dilligence and exsackness,
I reste,

Your Honner's dewtiful sarvant to command, JOSEPH LEMAN.

LETTER V

MR. LOVELACE, TO JOHN BELFORD, ESQ. ST. ALBAN'S, MONDAY NIGHT.

I snatch a few moments while my beloved is retired, [as I hope, to rest,] to perform my promise.
No pursuit--nor have I apprehensions of any; though I must make my charmer dread that there
will be one.

And now, let me tell thee, that never was joy so complete as mine!--But let me inquire, is
not the angel flown away?

*****

O no! She is in the next apartment!--Securely mine!--Mine for ever!

      O ecstasy!--My heart will burst my breast,
      To leap into her bosom!

I knew that the whole stupid family were in a combination to do my business for me. I told
thee that they were all working for me, like so many ground moles; and still more blind than
the moles are said to be, unknowing that they did so. I myself, the director of their principal
motions; which falling in with the malice of their little hearts, they took to be all their own.

But did I say my joy was perfect?--O no!--It receives some abatement from my disgusted bride.
For how can I endure to think that I owe more to her relations' precautions than to her favour
for me?--Or even, as far as I know, to her preference of me to another man?

But let me not indulge this thought. Were I to do so, it might cost my charmer dear. Let me
rejoice, that she has passed the rubicon: that she cannot return: that, as I have ordered it,
the flight will appear to the implacables to be altogether with her own consent: and that if
I doubt her love, I can put her to trials as mortifying to her niceness, as glorious to my
pride.--For, let me tell thee, dearly as I love her, if I thought there was but the shadow
of a doubt in her mind whether she preferred me to any man living, I would shew her no mercy.

TUESDAY, DAY-DAWN.

But, on the wings of love, I fly to my charmer, who perhaps by this time is rising to encourage
the tardy dawn. I have not slept a wink of the hour and half I lay down to invite sleep. It
seems to me, that I am not so much body, as to require such a vulgar renovation.

But why, as in the chariot, as in the inn, at alighting, all heart-bursting grief, my dearest
creature? SO persecuted as thou wert persecuted!--So much in danger of the most abhorred compulsion!--Yet
grief so unsuspectedly sincere for an escape so critical!--Take care, take care, O beloved
of my soul! for jealous is the heart in which love has erected a temple to thee.

Yet, it must be allowed, that such a sudden transition must affect her; must ice her over.
When a little more used to her new situation; when her hurries are at an end; when she sees
how religiously I shall observe all her INJUNCTIONS; she will undoubtedly have the gratitude
to distinguish between the confinement she has escaped from, and the liberty she has reason
to rejoice in.

She comes! She comes! And the sun is just rising to attend her! Adieu! Be half as happy as
I am (for all diffidencies, like night-fogs before the sun, disperse at her approach) and,
next myself, thou wilt be the happiest man in the world.

LETTER VI

MISS CLARISSA HARLOWE, TO MISS HOWE WEDNESDAY, APRIL 12.

I will pursue my melancholy story.

Being thus hurried to the chariot, it would have been to no purpose to have refused entering
into it, had he not in my fright lifted me in, as he did: and it instantly drove away a full
gallop, and stopped not till it brought us to St. Alban's; which was just as the day shut in.

I thought I should have fainted several times by the way. With uplifted hands and eyes, God
protect me! said I often to myself: Can it be I, that am here! My eyes running over, and my
heart ready to burst with sighs as involuntarily as my flight.

How different, how inexpressibly different, the gay wretch; visibly triumphing (as I could
not be construe his almost rapturous joy) in the success of his arts! But overflowing with
complimental flourishes, yet respectfully distant his address, all the way we flew; for that,
rather than galloping, was the motion of the horses; which took, as I believe, a round-about
way, to prevent being traced.

I have reason to think, there were other horsemen at his devotion; three or four different
persons, above the rank of the servants, galloping by us now-and-then, on each side of the
chariot: but he took no notice of them; and I had too much grief, mingled with indignation,
notwithstanding all his blandishments, to ask any questions about them, or any thing else.

Think, my dear, what were my thoughts on alighting from the chariot; having no attendant of
my own sex; no clothes but what I had on, and those little suited to such a journey as I had
already taken, and was still to take: neither hood nor hat, nor any thing but a handkerchief
round my head and shoulders: fatigued to death: my mind still more fatigued than my body: and
in such a foam the horses, that every one in the inn we put up at guessed [they could not do
otherwise] that I was a young giddy creature, who had run away from her friends. This it was
easy to see, by their whispering and gaping: more of the people of the house also coming in
by turns, than were necessary for the attendance.

The mistress of the house, whom he sent in to me, showed me another apartment; and, seeing
me ready to fain, brought me hartshorn and water; and then, upon my desiring to be left alone
for half an hour, retired: for I found my heart ready to burst, on revolving every thing in
my thoughts: and the moment she was gone, fastening the door, I threw myself into an old great
chair, and gave way to a violent flood of tears, which a little relieved me.

Mr. Lovelace, sooner than I wished, sent up the gentlewoman, who pressed me, in his name, to
admit my brother, or to come down to him: for he had told her I was his sister; and that he
had brought me, against my will, and without warning, from a friend's house, where I had been
all the winter, in order to prevent my marrying against the consent of my friends; to whom
he was now conducting me; and that, having given me no time for a travelling-dress, I was greatly
offended at him.

So, my dear, your frank, your open-hearted friend, was forced to countenance this tale; which
indeed suited me the better, because I was unable for some time to talk, speak, or look up;
and so my dejection, and grief, and silence, might very well pass before the gentlewoman and
her niece who attended me, as a fit of sullenness.

The room I was in being a bed-chamber, I chose to go down, at his repeated message, attended
by the mistress of the house, to that in which he was. He approached me with great respect,
yet not exceeding a brotherly politeness, where a brother is polite; and, calling me his dearest
sister, asked after the state of my mind; and hoped I would forgive him; for never brother
half so well loved a sister, as he me.

A wretch! how naturally did he fall into the character, although I was so much out of mine!

Unthinking creatures have some comfort in the shortness of their views; in their unapprehensiveness;
and that they penetrate not beyond the present moment: in short that they are unthinking!--But,
for a person of my thoughtful disposition, who has been accustomed to look forward, as well
to the possible, as to the probable, what comfort can I have in my reflections?

But let me give you the particulars of our conversation a little before and after our supper-time,
joining both in one.

When we were alone, he besought me (I cannot say but with all the tokens of a passionate and
respectful tenderness) to be better reconciled to myself and to him: he repeated all the vows
of honour and inviolable affection that he ever made me: he promised to be wholly governed
by me in every future step. He asked me to give him leave to propose, whether I chose to set
out next day to either of his aunts?

I was silent. I knew not what to say, nor what to do.

Whether I chose to have private lodgings procured for me in either of those ladies' neighbourhood,
as were once my thoughts?

I was still silent.

Whether I chose to go to either of Lord M.'s seats; that of Berks, or that in the county we
were in?

In lodgings, I said, any where, where he was not to be.

He had promised this, he owned; and he would religiously keep to his word, as soon as he found
all danger of pursuit over; and that I was settled to my mind. But, if the place were indifferent
to me, London was the safest, and the most private: and his relations should all visit me there,
the moment I thought fit to admit them. His cousin Charlotte, particularly, should attend me,
as my companion, if I would accept of her, as soon as she was able to go abroad. Mean time,
would I go to Lady Betty Lawrance's (Lady Sarah was a melancholy woman)? I should be the most
welcome guest she ever received.

I told him, I wished not to go (immediately, however, and in the frame I was in, and not likely
to be out of) to any of his relations: that my reputation was concerned, to have him absent
from me: that, if I were in some private lodging, the meaner the less to be suspected, (as
it would be known, that I went away by his means; and he would be supposed to have provided
me handsome accommodations,) it would be most suitable both to my mind and to my situation:
that this might be best, I should think, in the country for me; in town for him. And no matter
how soon he was known to be there.

If he might deliver his opinion, he said, it was, that since I declined going to any of his
relations, London was the only place in the world to be private in. Every new comer in a country
town or village excited a curiosity: A person of my figure [and many compliments he made me]
would excite more. Even messages and letters, where none used to be brought, would occasion
inquiry. He had not provided a lodging any where, supposing I would choose to go either to
London, where accommodations of that sort might be fixed upon in an hour's time, or to Lady
Betty's; or to Lord M.'s Herfordshire seat, where was the housekeeper, an excellent woman,
Mrs. Greme, such another as my Norton.

To be sure, I said, if I were pursued, it would be in their first passion; and some one of
his relations' houses would be the place they would expect to find me at--I knew not what to do.

My pleasure should determine him, he said, be it what it would. Only that I were safe, was
all he was solicitous about. He had lodgings in town; but he did not offer to propose them.
He knew, I would have more objections to go to them, than I could to go to Lord M.'s, or to
Lady Betty's.

No doubt of it, I replied, with such an indignation in my manner, as made him run over with
professions, that he was far from proposing them, or wishing for my acceptance of them. And
again he repeated, that my honour and safety were all he was solicitous about; assuring me,
that my will should be a law to him in every particular.

I was too peevish, and too much afflicted, and indeed too much incensed against him, to take
well any thing he said.

I thought myself, I said, extremely unhappy. I knew not what to determine upon: my reputation
now, no doubt, utterly ruined: destitute of clothes: unfit to be seen by any body: my very
indigence, as I might call it, proclaiming my folly to every one who saw me; who would suppose
that I had been taken at advantage, or had given an undue one; and had no power over either
my will or my actions: that I could not but think I had been dealt artfully with: that he had
seemed to have taken, what he might suppose, the just measure of my weakness, founded on my
youth and inexperience: that I could not forgive myself for meeting him: that my heart bled
for the distresses of my father and mother, on this occasion: that I would give the world,
and all my hopes in it, to have been still in my father's house, whatever had been my usage:
that, let him protest and vow what he would, I saw something low and selfish in his love, that
he could study to put a young creature upon making such a sacrifice of her duty and conscience:
when a person, actuated by a generous love, must seek to oblige the object of it, in every
thing essential to her honour, and to her peace of mind.

He was very attentive to all I said, never offering to interrupt me once. His answer to every
article, almost methodically, shewed his memory.

'What I had said, he told me, made him very grave; and he would answer accordingly.

'He was grieved at his heart, to find that he had so little share in my favour or confidence.

'As to my reputation, (he must be very sincere with me,) that could not suffer half so much
by the step I so regretted to have taken, as by the confinement, and equally foolish and unjust
treatment, I had met with from my relations: that every mouth was full of blame of them, of
my brother and sister particularly; and of wonder at my patience: that he must repeat what
he had written to me he believed more than once, That my friends themselves expected that I
should take a proper opportunity to free myself from their persecutions; why else did they
confine me? That my exalted character, as he called it, would still bear me out, with those
who knew me; who knew my brother's and sister's motives; and who knew the wretch they were
for compelling me to have.

'With regard to clothes; who, as matters were circumstanced, could expect that I should be
able to bring away any others than those I had on at the time? For present use or wear, all
the ladies of his family would take a pride to supply me: for future, the product of the best
looms, not only in England, but throughout the world, were at my command.

'If I wanted money, as no doubt I must, he should be proud to supply me: Would to heaven, he
might presume to hope, there were but one interest between us!'

And then he would fain have had me to accept of a bank note of a hundred pounds; which, unawares
to me, he put into my hand: but which, you may be sure, I refused with warmth.

'He was inexpressibly grieved and surprised, he said, to hear me say had acted artfully by
me. He came provided, according to my confirmed appointment,' [a wretch to upbraid me thus!]
'to redeem me from my persecutors; and little expected a change of sentiment, and that he should
have so much difficulty to prevail upon me, as he had met with: that perhaps I might think
his offer to go into the garden with me, and to face my assembled relations, was a piece of
art only: but that if I did, I wronged him: since to this hour, seeing my excessive uneasiness,
he wished, with all his soul he had been permitted to accompany me in. It was always his maxim
to brave a threatened danger. Threateners, where they have an opportunity to put in force their
threats, were seldom to be feared. But had he been assured of a private stab, or of as many
death's wounds as there were persons in my family, (made desperate as he should have been by
my return,) he would have attended me into the house.'

So, my dear, what I have to do, is to hold myself inexcusable for meeting such a determined
and audacious spirit; that's all! I have hardly any question now, but that he would have contrived
some wicked stratagem or other to have got me away, had I met him at a midnight hour, as once
or twice I had thoughts to do; and that would have been more terrible still.

He concluded this part of his talk, with saying, 'That he doubted not but that, had he attended
me in, he should have come off in every one's opinion well, that he should have had general
leave to renew his visits.'

He went on--'He must be so bold as to tell me, that he should have paid a visit of this kind,
(but indeed accompanied by several of his trusty friends,) had I not met him; and that very
afternoon too; for he could not tamely let the dreadful Wednesday come, without making some
effort to change their determinations.'

What, my dear, was to be done with such a man!

'That therefore for my sake, as well as for his own, he had reason to wish that a disease so
desperate had been attempted to be overcome by as desperate a remedy. We all know, said he,
that great ends are sometimes brought about by the very means by which they are endeavoured
to be frustrated.'

My present situation, I am sure, thought I, affords a sad evidence of this truth!

I was silent all this time. My blame was indeed turned inward. Sometimes, too, I was half-frighted
at his audaciousness: at others, had the less inclination to interrupt him, being excessively
fatigued, and my spirits sunk to nothing, with a view even of the best prospects with such a man.

This gave his opportunity to proceed: and that he did; assuming a still more serious air.

'As to what further remained for him to say, in answer to what I had said, he hoped I would
pardon him; but, upon his soul, he was concerned, infinitely concerned, he repeated, (his colour
and his voice rising,) that it was necessary for him to observe, how much I chose rather to
have run the risque of being Solmes's wife, than to have it in my power to reward a man who,
I must forgive him, had been as much insulted on my account, as I had been on his--who had
watched my commands, and (pardon me, Madam) ever changeable motion of your pen, all hours,
in all weathers, and with a cheerfulness and ardour, that nothing but the most faithful and
obsequious passion could inspire.'

I now, my dear, began to revive into a little more warmth of attention.--

'And all, Madam, for what?'--How I stared! for he stopt then a moment or two--'Only,' went
he on, 'to prevail upon you to free yourself from ungenerous and base oppressions'--

Sir, Sir, indignantly said I--

'Hear me but out, dearest Madam!--My heart is full--I must speak what I have to say--To be
told (for your words are yet in my ears, and at my heart!) that you would give the world, and
all your hopes in it, to have been still in your cruel and gloomy father's house'--

Not a word, Sir, against my father!--I will not bear that--

'Whatever had been your usage:--and you have a credulity, Madam, against all probability, if
you believe you should have avoided being Solmes's wife: That I have put you upon sacrificing
your duty and conscience--yet, dearest creature! see you not the contradiction that your warmth
of temper has surprised you into, when the reluctance you shewed to the last to leave your
persecutors, has cleared your conscience from the least reproach of this sort?'--

O Sir! Sir! are you so critical then? Are you so light in your anger as to dwell upon words?--

Indeed, my dear, I have since thought that his anger was not owing to that sudden impetus,
which cannot be easily bridled; but rather was a sort of manageable anger let loose to intimidate
me.

'Forgive me, Madam--I have just done--Have I not, in your opinion, hazarded my life to redeem
you from oppression? Yet is not my reward, after all, precarious?--For, Madam, have you not
conditioned with me (and, hard as the condition is, most sacredly will I observe it) that all
my hope must be remote? That you are determined to have it in your power to favour or reject
me totally, as you please?'

See, my dear! in every respect my condition changed for the worse! Is it in my power to take
your advice, if I should think it ever so right to take it?*

     * Clarissa had been censured as behaving to Mr. Lovelace, in their first
conversation at St. Alban's, and afterwards, with too much reserve, and
even with haughtiness. Surely those, who have thought her to blame on
this account, have not paid a due attention to the story. How early, as
above, and in what immediately follows, does he remind her of the terms
of distance which she had prescribed to him, before she was in his
power, in hopes to leave the door open for a reconciliation with
her friends, which her heart was set upon? And how artfully does he
(unrequired) promise to observe the conditions in which she in her
present circumstances and situation (in pursuance of Miss Howe's advice)
would gladly have dispensed with?--To say nothing of the resentment she
was under a necessity to shew, at the manner of his getting her away, in
order to justify to him the sincerity of her refusal to go off with him.
See, in her subsequent Letter to Miss Howe, No. IX., her own sense upon
the subject.

'And have you not furthermore declared,' proceeded he 'that you will engage to renounce me
for ever, if you friends insist upon that cruel renunciation, as the terms of being reconciled
to you?

'But nevertheless, Madam, all the merit of having saved you from an odious compulsion, shall
be mine. I glory in it, though I were to lose you for ever. As I see I am but too likely to
do, from your present displeasure; and especially, if your friends insist upon the terms you
are ready to comply with.

'That you are your own mistress, through my means, is, I repeat, my boast. As such, I humbly
implore your favour, and that only upon the conditions I have yielded to hope for it. As I
do now, thus humbly, [the proud wretch falling on one knee,] your forgiveness, for so long
detaining your ear, and for all the plain dealing that my undesigning heart would not be denied
to utter by my lips.'

O Sir, pray rise! Let the obliged kneel, if one of us must kneel! But, nevertheless, proceed
not in this strain, I beseech you. You have had a great deal of trouble about me: but had you
let me know in time, that you expected to be rewarded for it at the price of my duty, I should
have spared you much of it.

Far be it from me, Sir, to depreciate merit so extraordinary. But let me say, that had it not
been for the forbidden correspondence I was teased by you into; and which I had not continued
(every letter, for many letters, intended to be the last) but because I thought you a sufferer
from my friends; I had not been either confined or ill treated: nor would my brother's low-meant
violence have had a foundation to work upon.

I am far from thinking my case would have been so very desperate as you imagine had I staid.
My father loved me in his heart: he would not see me before; and I wanted only to see him,
and to be heard; and a delay of his sentence was the least thing I expected from the trial
I was to stand.

You are boasting of your merits, Sir: let merit be your boast; nothing else can attract me.
If personal considerations had principal weight with me, either in Solmes's disfavour, or in
your favour, I shall despise myself: if you value yourself upon them, in preference to the
person of the poor Solmes, I shall despise you!

You may glory in your fancied merits in getting me away: but the cause of your glory, I tell
you plainly, is my shame.

Make to yourself a title to my regard, which I can better approve of; or else you will not
have so much merit with me, as you have with yourself.

But here, Sir, like the first pair, (I, at least, driven out of my paradise,) are we recriminating.
No more shall you need to tell me of your sufferings, and your merits! your all hours, and
all weathers! For I will bear them in memory as long as I live; and if it be impossible for
me to reward them, be ever ready to own the obligation. All that I desire of you now is, to
leave it to myself to seek for some private abode: to take the chariot with you to London,
or elsewhere: and, if I have any further occasion for your assistance and protection, I will
signify it to you, and be still further obliged to you.

You are warm, my dearest life!--But indeed there is no occasion for it. Had I any views unworthy
of my faithful love for you, I should not have been so honest in my declarations.

Then he began again to vow the sincerity of his intentions--

But I took him up short: I am willing to believe you, Sir. It would be insupportable but to
suppose there were a necessity for such solemn declarations. [At this he seemed to collect
himself, as I may say, into a little more circumspection.] If I thought there were, I would
not sit with you here, in a public inn, I assure you, although cheated hither, as far as I
know, by methods (you must excuse me, Sir) which, but to suspect, will hardly let me have patience
either with you or with myself--but no more of this, just now: Let me, I beseech you, good
Sir, bowing [I was very angry!] let me only know whether you intend to leave me; or whether
I have only escaped from one confinement to another?

Cheated hither, as far as I know, Madam! Let you know (and with that air, too, charming, though
grievous to my heart!) if you have only escaped from one confinement to another--amazing! perfectly
amazing! And can there be a necessity for me to answer this? You are absolutely your own mistress--it
was very strange, if you were not. The moment you are in a place of safety, I will leave you.
To one condition only, give me leave to beg your consent: it is this, that you will be pleased,
now you are so entirely in your own power, to renew a promise voluntarily made before; voluntarily,
or I would not now presume to request it; for although I would not be thought capable of growing
upon concession, yet I cannot bear to think of losing the ground your goodness had given me
room to hope I had gained; 'That, make up how you please with your relations, you will never
marry any other man, while I am living and single, unless I should be so wicked as to give
new cause for high displeasure.'

I hesitate not to confirm this promise, Sir, upon your own condition. In what manner do you
expect to confirm it?

Only, Madam, by your word.

Then I never will.

He had the assurance (I was now in his power) to salute me as a sealing of my promise, as he
called it. His motion was so sudden, that I was not aware of it. It would have looked affected
to be very angry; yet I could not be pleased, considering this as a leading freedom, from a
spirit so audacious and encroaching: and he might see, that I was not.

He passed all that my with an air peculiar to himself--Enough, enough, dearest Madam! And now
let me beg of you but to conquer this dreadful uneasiness, which gives me to apprehend too
much for my jealous love to bear; and it shall be my whole endeavour to deserve your favour,
and to make you the happiest woman in the world; as I shall be the happiest of men.

I broke from him to write to you my preceding letter; but refused to send it by his servant,
as I told you. The mistress of the house helped me to a messenger, who was to carry what you
should give him to Lord M.'s seat in Hertfordshire, directed for Mrs. Greme, the housekeeper
there. And early in the morning, for fear of pursuit, we were to set out that way: and there
he proposed to change the chariot and six for a chaise and pair of his own, which he had at
that seat, as it would be a less-noticed conveyance.

I looked over my little stock of money; and found it to be no more than seven guineas and some
silver: the rest of my stock was but fifty guineas, and that five more than I thought it was,
when my sister challeneged me as to the sum I had by me:* and those I left in my escritoire,
little intending to go away with him.

     * See Vol. I. Letter XLIII.

Indeed my case abounds with a shocking number of indelicate circumstances. Among the rest,
I was forced to account to him, who knew I could have no clothes but what I had on, how I came
to have linen with me (for he could not but know I sent for it); lest he should imagine I had
an early design to go away with him, and made that part of the preparation.

He most heartily wished, he said, for my mind's sake, that your mother would have afforded
me her protection; and delivered himself upon this subject with equal freedom and concern.

There are, my dear Miss Howe, a multitude of punctilios and decorums, which a young creature
must dispense with, who, in a situation like mine, makes a man the intimate attendant of her
person. I could now, I think, give twenty reasons stronger than any I have heretofore mentioned,
why women of the least delicacy should never think of incurring the danger and the disgrace
of taking the step I have been drawn in to take, but with horror and aversion; and why they
should look upon the man who should tempt them to it, as the vilest and most selfish of seducers.

*****

Before five o'clock (Tuesday morning) the maidservant came up to tell me that my brother was
ready, and that breakfast also waited for me in the parlour. I went down with a heart as heavy
as my eyes, and received great acknowledgements and compliments from him on being so soon dressed,
and ready (as he interpreted it) to continue on our journey.

He had the thought which I had not (for what had I to with thinking, who had it not when I
stood most in need of it?) to purchase for me a velvet hood, and a short cloke, trimmed with
silver, without saying any thing to me. He must reward himself, the artful encroacher said,
before the landlady and her maids and niece, for his forethought; and would salute his pretty
sullen sister!--He took his reward; and, as he said before, a tear with it. While he assured
me, still before them [a vile wretch!] that I had nothing to fear from meeting with parents
who so dearly loved me.--

How could I be complaisant, my dear, to such a man as this?

When we had got in the chariot, and it began to move, he asked me, whether I had any objection
to go to Lord M.'s Hertfordshire seat? His Lordship, he said, was at his Berkshire one.

I told him, I chose not to go, as yet, to any of his relations; for that would indicate a plain
defiance to my own. My choice was, to go to a private lodging, and for him to be at a distance
from me: at least, till I heard how things were taken by my friends: for that, although I had
but little hopes of a reconciliation as it was; yet if they knew I was in his protection, or
in that of any of his friends, (which would be looked upon as the same thing,) there would
not be room for any hopes at all.

I should govern him as I pleased, he solemnly assured me, in every thing. But he still thought
London was the best place for me; and if I were once safe there, and in a lodging to my liking,
he would go to M. Hall. But, as I approved not of London, he would urge it no further.

He proposed, and I consented, to put up at an inn in the neighbourhood of The Lawn (as he called
Lord M.'s seat in this county) since I chose not to go thither. And here I got two hours to
myself; which I told him I should pass in writing another letter to you, (meaning my narrative,
which, though greatly fatigued, I had begun at St. Alban's,) and in one to my sister, to apprise
the family (whether they were solicitous about it or not) that I was well; and to beg that
my clothes, some particular books, and the fifty guineas I had left in my escritoire, might
be sent me.

He asked, if I had considered whither to have them directed?

Indeed, not I, I told him: I was a stranger to--

So was he, he interrupted me; but it struck him by chance--

Wicked story-teller!

But, added he, I will tell you, Madam, how it shall be managed--If you don't choose to go to
London, it is, nevertheless, best that your relations should think you there; for then they
will absolutely despair of finding you. If you write, be pleased to direct, to be left for
you, at Mr. Osgood's, near Soho-square. Mr. Osgood is a man of reputation: and this will effectually
amuse them.

Amuse them, my dear!--Amuse whom?--My father!--my uncles!--But it must be so!----All his expedients
ready, you see!

I had no objection to this: and I have written accordingly. But what answer I shall have, or
whether any, that is what gives me no small anxiety.

This, however, is one consolation, that if I have an answer, and although my brother should
be the writer, it cannot be more severe than the treatment I have of late received from him
and my sister.

Mr. Lovelace staid out about an hour and half; and then came in; impatiently sending up to
me no less than four times, to desire admittance. But I sent him word as often, that I was
busy; and at last, that I should be so, till dinner was ready. He then hastened that, as I
heard him now-and-then, with a hearty curse upon the cook and waiters.

This is another of his perfections. I ventured afterwards to check him for his free words,
as we sat at dinner.

Having heard him swear at his servant, when below, whom, nevertheless, he owns to be a good
one; it is a sad life, said I, these innkeepers live, Mr. Lovelace.

No; pretty well, I believe--but why, Madam, think you, that fellows, who eat and drink at other
men's cost, or they are sorry innkeepers, should be entitled to pity?

Because of the soldiers they are obliged to quarter; who are generally, I believe, wretched
profligates. Bless me! said I, how I heard one of them swear and curse, just now, at a modest,
meek man, as I judge by his low voice, and gentle answers!--Well do they make it a proverb--Like
a trooper!

He bit his lip; arose; turned upon his heel; stept to the glass; and looking confidently abashed,
if I may say so, Ay, Madam, said he, these troopers are sad swearing fellows. I think their
officers should chastise them for it.

I am sure they deserve chastisement, replied I: for swearing is a most unmanly vice, and cursing
as poor and low a one; since they proclaim the profligate's want of power, and his wickedness
at the same time; for, could such a one punish as he speaks, he would be a fiend!

Charmingly observed, by my soul, Madam!--The next trooper I hear swear and curse, I'll tell
him what an unmanly, and what a poor wretch he is.

Mrs. Greme came to pay her duty to me, as Mr. Lovelace called it; and was very urgent with
me to go to her lord's house; letting me know what handsome things she had heard of her lord,
and his two nieces, and all the family, say of me; and what wishes for several months past
they had put up for the honour she now hoped would soon be done them all.

This gave me some satisfaction, as it confirmed from the mouth of a very good sort of woman
all that Mr. Lovelace had told me.

Upon inquiry about a private lodging, she recommended me to a sister-in-law of hers, eight
miles from thence--where I now am. And what pleased me the better, was, that Mr. Lovelace (of
whom I could see she was infinitely observant) obliged her, of his own motion, to accompany
me in the chaise; himself riding on horseback, with his two servants, and one of Lord M.'s.
And here we arrived about four o'clock.

But, as I told you in my former, the lodgings are inconvenient. Mr. Lovelace indeed found great
fault with them: and told Mrs. Greme (who had said, that they were not worthy of us) that they
came not up even to her own account of them. As the house was a mile from a town, it was not
proper for him, he said, to be so far distant from me, lest any thing should happen: and yet
the apartments were not separate and distinct enough for me to like them, he was sure.

This must be agreeable enough for him, you will believe.

Mrs. Greme and I had a good deal of talk in the chaise about him: she was very easy and free
in her answers to all I asked; and has, I find, a very serious turn.

I led her on to say to the following effect; some part of it not unlike what Lord M.'s dismissed
bailiff had said before; by which I find that all the servants have a like opinion of him.

'That Mr. Lovelace was a generous man: that it was hard to say, whether the servants of her
lord's family loved or feared him most: that her lord had a very great affection for him: that
his two noble aunts were not less fond of him: that his cousins Montague were as good natured
young ladies as ever lived: that Lord M. and Lady Sarah, and Lady Betty had proposed several
ladies to him, before he made his addresses to me: and even since; despairing to move me and
my friends in his favour.--But that he had no thoughts of marrying at all, she had heard him
say, if it were not to me: that as well her lord as the two ladies his sisters were a good
deal concerned at the ill-usage he received from my family: but admired my character, and wished
to have him married to me (although I were not to have a shilling) in preference to any other
person, from the opinion they had of the influence I should have over him. That, to be sure,
Mr. Lovelace was a wild gentleman: but wildness was a distemper which would cure itself. That
her lord delighted in his company, whenever he could get it: but that they often fell out;
and his lordship was always forced to submit--indeed, was half afraid of him, she believed;
for Mr. Lovelace would do as he pleased. She mingled a thousand pities often, that he acted
not up to the talents lent him--yet would have it, that he had fine qualities to found a reformation
upon: and, when the happy day came, would make amends for all: and of this all his friends
were so assured, that they wished for nothing so earnestly, as for his marriage.'

This, indifferent as it is, is better than my brother says of him.

The people of the house here are very honest-looking industrious folks: Mrs. Sorlings is the
gentlewoman's name. The farm seems well stocked, and thriving. She is a widow; has two sons,
men grown, who vie with each other which shall take most pains in promoting the common good;
and they are both of them, I already see, more respectful to two modest young women their sisters,
than my brother was to his sister.

I believe I must stay here longer than at first I thought I should.

I ought to have mentioned, that, before I set out for this place, I received your kind letter.*
Every thing is kind from so dear a friend.

     * See Vol. II. Letter XLVII.

I own, that after I had told you of my absolute determination not to go away with him, you
might well be surprised, at your first hearing that I was actually gone. The Lord bless me,
my dear, I myself, at times, can hardly believe it is I, that have been led to take so strange
a step.

I have not the better opinion of Mr. Lovelace for his extravagant volubility. He is too full
of professions. He says too many fine things of me, and to me. True respect, true value, I
think, lies not in words: words cannot express it: the silent awe, the humble, the doubting
eye, and even the hesitating voice, better shew it by much, than, as our beloved Shakespeare says,

       ----The rattling tongue
      Of saucy and audacious eloquence.

The man indeed at times is all upon the ecstatic; one of his phrases. But, to my shame and
confusion, I must say, that I know too well to what to attribute his transports. In one word,
it is to his triumph, my dear. And, to impute it to that perhaps equally exposes my vanity,
and condemns my folly.

We have been alarmed with notions of a pursuit, founded upon a letter from his intelligencer.

How do different circumstances either sanctify or condemn the same action!--What care ought
we to take not to confound the distinctions of right and wrong, when self comes in the question!--I
condemned in Mr. Lovelace the corrupting of a servant of my father's; and now I am glad to
give a kind of indirect approbation of that fault, by inquiring of him what he hears, by that
or any other way, of the manner in which my relations took my flight. A preconcerted, forward,
and artful flight, it must undoubtedly appear to them. How grievous is that to think of! yet
how, as long as I am situated, can I put them right?

Most heavily, he says, they take it; but shew not so much grief as rage. And he can hardly
have patience to hear of the virulence and menaces of my brother against himself. Then a merit
is made to me of his forbearance.

What a satisfaction am I robbed of, my dearest friend, when I reflect upon my inconsiderateness!
O that I had it still in my power to say I suffered wrong, rather than did wrong! That others
were more wanting in their kindness to me than I duty (where duty is owing) to them.

Fie upon me! for meeting the seducer!--Let all end as happily as it now may, I have laid up
for myself remorse for my whole life.

What still more concerns me is, that every time I see this man, I am still at a greater loss
than before what to make of him. I watch every turn of his countenance: and I think I see very
deep lines in it. He looks with more meaning, I verily think, than he used to look; yet not
more serious; not less gay--I don't know how he looks--but with more confidence a great deal
than formerly; and yet he never wanted that.

But here is the thing; I behold him with fear now, as conscious of the power my indiscretion
has given him over me. And well may he look more elate, when he sees me deprived of all the
self-supposed significance, which adorns and exults a person who has been accustomed to respect;
and who now, by a conscious inferiority, allows herself to be overcome, and in a state of obligation,
as I may say, to a man who from a humble suitor to her for her favour, assumes the consequence
and airs of a protector.

I shall send this, as my former, by a poor man, who travels every day with pedlary matters.
He will leave it at Mrs. Knolly's, as you direct.

If you hear any thing of my father and mother, and of their health, and how my friends were
affected by my unhappy step, pray be so good as to write me a few lines by the messenger, if
his waiting for them can be known to you. TUESDAY, WEDN. APRIL 11, 12.

You claim my promise, that I will be as particular as possible, in all that passes between
me and my goddess. Indeed, I never had a more illustrious subject to exercise my pen. And,
moreover, I have leisure; for by her good will, my access would be as difficult to her, as
that of the humblest slave to an Eastern monarch. Nothing, then, but inclination to write can
be wanting; and since our friendship, and your obliging attendance upon me at the White Hart,
will not excuse that, I will endeavour to keep my word.

I parted with thee and thy brethren, with a full resolution, thou knowest, to rejoin ye, if
she once again disappointed me, in order to go together (attended by our servants, for shew
sake) to the gloomy father; and demand audience of the tyrant upon the freedoms taken with
my character. In short, to have tried by fair resolutions, and treat his charming daughter
with less inhumanity, and me with more civility.

I told thee my reasons for not going in search of a letter of countermand. I was right; for
if I had, I should have found such a one; and had I received it, she would not have met me.
Did she think, that after I had been more than once disappointed, I would not keep her to her
promise; that I would not hold her to it, when I had got her in so deeply?

The moment I heard the door unbolt, I was sure of her. That motion made my heart bound to my
throat. But when that was followed with the presence of my charmer, flashing upon me all at
once in a flood of brightness, sweetly dressed, though all unprepared for a journey, I trod
air, and hardly thought myself a mortal.

Thou shalt judge of her dress, as at the moment I first beheld her she appeared to me, and
as, upon a nearer observation, she really was. I am a critic, thou knowest, in women's dresses.
Many a one have I taught to dress, and helped to undress. But there is such a native elegance
in this lady, that she surpasses all that I could imagine surpassing. But then her person adorns
what she wears, more than dress can adorn her; and that's her excellence.

Expect therefore a faint sketch of her admirable person with her dress.

Her wax-like flesh (for after all, flesh and blood I think she is) by its delicacy and firmness,
answers for the soundness of her health. Thou hast often heard me launch out in praise of her
complexion. I never in my life beheld a skins so illustriously fair. The lily and the driven
snow it is nonsense to talk of: her lawn and her laces one might indeed compare to those; but
what a whited wall would a woman appear to be, who had a complexion which would justify such
unnatural comparisons? But this lady is all glowing, all charming flesh and blood; yet so clear,
that every meandring vein is to be seen in all the lovely parts of her which custom permits
to be visible.

Thou has heard me also describe the wavy ringlets of her shining hair, needing neither art
nor powder; of itself an ornament, defying all other ornaments; wantoning in and about a neck
that is beautiful beyond description.

Her head-dress was a Brussels-lace mob, peculiarly adapted to the charming air and turn of
her features. A sky-blue ribband illustrated that. But although the weather was somewhat sharp,
she had not on either hat or hood; for, besides that she loves to use herself hardily (by which
means and by a temperance truly exemplary, she is allowed to have given high health and vigour
to an originally tender constitution) she seems to have intended to shew me, that she was determined
not to stand to her appointment. O Jack! that such a sweet girl should be a rogue!

Her morning gown was a pale primrose-coloured paduasoy: the cuffs and robins curiously embroidered
by the fingers of this ever-charming Arachne, in a running pattern of violets and their leaves,
the light in the flowers silver, gold in the leaves. A pair of diamond snaps in her ears. A
white handkerchief wrought by the same inimitable fingers concealed--O Belford! what still
more inimitable beauties did it not conceal!--And I saw, all the way we rode, the bounding
heart (by its throbbing motions I saw it!) dancing beneath her charming umbrage.

Her ruffles were the same as her mob. Her apron a flowered lawn. Her coat white sattin, quilted:
blue sattin her shoes, braided with the same colour, without lace; for what need has the prettiest
foot in the world of ornament? neat buckles in them: and on her charming arms a pair of black
velvet glove-like muffs of her own invention; for she makes and gives fashions as she pleases.--Her
hands velvet of themselves, thus uncovered the freer to be grasped by those of her adorer.

I have told thee what were my transports, when the undrawn bolt presented to me my long-expected
goddess. Her emotions were more sweetly feminine, after the first moments; for then the fire
of her starry eyes began to sink into a less dazzling languor. She trembled: nor knew she how
to support the agitations of a heart she had never found so ungovernable. She was even fainting,
when I clasped her in my supporting arms. What a precious moment that! How near, how sweetly
near, the throbbing partners!

By her dress, I saw, as I observed before, how unprepared she was for a journey; and not doubting
her intention once more to disappoint me, I would have drawn her after me. Then began a contention
the most vehement that ever I had with woman. It would pain thy friendly heart to be told the
infinite trouble I had with her. I begged, I prayed; on my knees, yet in vain, I begged and
prayed her to answer her own appointment: and had I not happily provided for such a struggle,
knowing whom I had to deal with, I had certainly failed in my design; and as certainly would
have accompanied her in, without thee and thy brethren: and who knows what might have been
the consequence?

But my honest agent answering my signal, though not quite so soon as I expected, in the manner
thou knowest I had prescribed, They are coming! They are coming!--Fly, fly, my beloved creature,
cried I, drawing my sword with a flourish, as if I would have slain half an hundred of the
supposed intruders; and, seizing her trembling hands, I drew her after me so swiftly, that
my feet, winged by love, could hardly keep pace with her feet, agitated by fear.--And so I
became her emperor.

I'll tell thee all, when I see thee: and thou shalt then judge of my difficulties, and of her
perverseness. And thou wilt rejoice with me at my conquest over such a watchful and open-eyed
charmer.

But seest thou not now (as I think I do) the wind outstripping fair one flying from her love
to her love? Is there not such a game?--Nay, flying from her friends she was resolved not to
abandon, to the man she was determined not to go off with?--The sex! the sex, all over!--Charming
contradiction!--Hah, hah, hah, hah!--I must here--I must here, lay down my pen, to hold my
sides; for I must have my laugh out now the fit is upon me.

*****

I believe--I believe--Hah, hah, hah! I believe, Jack, my dogs conclude me mad: for here has
one of them popt in, as if to see what ailed me, or whom I had with me. Hah, hah, hah! An impudent
dog! O Jack, knewest thou my conceit, and were but thy laugh joined to mine, I believe it would
hold me for an hour longer.

But, O my best beloved fair one, repine not thou at the arts by which thou suspectest thy fruitless
vigilence has been over watched. Take care, that thou provokest not new ones, that may be still
more worthy of thee. If once thy emperor decrees thy fall, thou shalt greatly fall. Thou shalt
have cause, if that come to pass, which may come to pass (for why wouldst thou put off marriage
to so long a day, as till thou hadst reason to be convinced of my reformation, dearest?) thou
shalt have cause, never fear, to sit down more dissatisfied with the stars, than with thyself.
And come the worst to the worst, glorious terms will I give thee. Thy garrison, with general
Prudence at the head, and governor Watchfulness bringing up the rear, shall be allowed to march
out with all the honours due to so brave a resistance. And all thy sex, and all mine, that
hear of my stratagems, and of thy conduct, shall acknowledge the fortress as nobly won as defended.

'Thou wilt not dare, methinks I hear thee say, to attempt to reduce such a goddess as this,
to a standard unworthy of her excellencies. It is impossible, Lovelace, that thou shouldst
intent to break through oaths and protestations so solemn.'

That I did not intend it, is certain. That I do intend it, I cannot (my heart, my reverence
for her, will not let me) say. But knowest thou not my aversion to the state of shackles?--And
is she not IN MY POWER?

'And wilt thou, Lovelace, abuse that power which--'

Which what, Belford? Which I obtained not by her own consent, but against it.

'But which thou never hadst obtained, had she not esteemed thee above all men.'

And which I had never taken so much pains to obtain, had I not loved her above all women. So
far upon a par, Jack! and if thou pleadest honour, ought not honour to be mutual? If mutual,
does it not imply mutual trust, mutual confidence? And what have I had of that from her to
boast of?--Thou knowest the whole progress of our warfare: for a warfare it has truly been;
and far, very far, from an amorous warfare too. Doubts, mistrusts, upbraidings, on her part;
humiliations the most abject, on mine. Obliged to assume such airs of reformation, that every
varlet of ye has been afraid I should reclaim in good earnest. And hast thou not thyself frequently
observed to me, how awkwardly I returned to my usual gayety, after I had been within a mile
of her father's garden-wall, although I had not seen her?

Does she not deserve to pay for all this?--To make an honest fellow look like an hypocrite,
what a vile thing is that!

Then thou knowest what a false little rogue she has been. How little conscience she has made
of disappointing me. Hast thou not been a witness of my ravings on this score? Have I not,
in the height of them, vowed revenge upon the faithless charmer? And if I must be forsworn,
whether I answer her expectations, or follow my own inclinations; and if the option be in my
own power, can I hesitate a moment which to choose?

Then, I fancy by her circumspection, and her continual grief, that she expects some mischief
from me. I don't care to disappoint any body I have a value for.

But O the noble, the exalted creature! Who can avoid hesitating when he thinks of an offence
against her? Who can but pity--

Yet, on the other hand, so loth at last to venture, though threatened to be forced into the
nuptial fetters with a man, whom to look upon as a rival, is to disgrace myself!--So sullen,
now she has ventured!--What title has she to pity; and to a pity which her pride would make
her disclaim?

But I resolve not any way. I will see how her will works; and how my will leads me on. I will
give the combatants fair play, and yet, every time I attend her, I find that she is less in
my power; I more in hers.

Yet, a foolish little rogue! to forbid me to think of marriage till I am a reformed man! Till
the implacables of her family change their natures, and become placable!

It is true, when she was for making those conditions, she did not think, that without any,
she should be cheated out of herself; for so the dear soul, as I may tell thee in its place,
phrases it.

How it swells my pride, to have been able to outwit such a vigilant charmer! I am taller by
half a yard in my imagination than I was. I look down upon every body now. Last night I was
still more extravagant. I took off my hat, as I walked, to see if the lace were not scorched,
supposing it had brushed down a star; and, before I put it on again, in mere wantonness and
heart's ease, I was for buffeting the moon.

In short, my whole soul is joy. When I go to bed I laugh myself asleep; and I awake either
laughing or singing--yet nothing nearly in view, neither--For why?--I am not yet reformed enough!

I told thee at the time, if thou rememberest, how capable this restriction was of being turned
upon the over-scrupulous dear creature, could I once get her out of her father's house; and
were I disposed to punish her for her family's faults, and for the infinite trouble she herself
had given me. Little thinks she, that I have kept an account of both: and that, when my heart
is soft, and all her own, I can but turn to my memoranda, and harden myself at once.

O my charmer, look to it! Abate of thy haughty airs! Value not thyself upon thy sincerity,
if thou art indifferent to me! I will not bear it now. Art thou not in my POWER!--Nor, if thou
lovest me, think, that the female affectation of denying thy love, will avail thee now, with
a heart so proud and so jealous as mine?--Remember, moreover, that all thy family sins are
upon thy head--!

But ah! Jack, when I see my angel, when I am admitted to the presence of this radiant beauty,
what will become of all this vapouring?

But, be my end what it may, I am obliged, by thy penetration, fair one, to proceed by the sap.
Fair and softly. A wife at any time! Marriage will be always in my power.

When put to the university, the same course of initial studies will qualify the yonker for
the one line or the other. The genius ought to point out the future lawyer, divine, or physician!--So
the same cautious conduct, with such a vigilance, will do either for the wife, or for the no-wife.
When I reform, I'll marry. 'Tis time enough for the one, the lady must say--for the other, say I!

But how I ramble!--This is to be in such a situation, that I know not what to resolve upon.

I'll tell thee my inclinings, as I proceed. The pro's and the con's I'll tell thee: but being
got too far from the track I set out in, I will close here. I may, however, write every day
something, and send it as opportunity offers.

Regardless, nevertheless, I shall be in all I write, of connection, accuracy, or of any thing
but of my own imperial will and pleasure.

LETTER VIII

MISS HOWE, TO MISS CLARISSA HARLOWE WEDNESDAY NIGHT, APRIL 12.

I have your narrative, my dear. You are the same noble creature you ever were. Above disguise,
above art, above attempting to extenuate a failing.

The only family in the world, yours, surely, that could have driven such a daughter upon such
extremities.

But you must not be so very much too good for them, and for the case.

You lay the blame so properly and so unsparingly upon your meeting him, that nothing can be
added to that subject by your worst enemies, were they to see what you have written.

I am not surprised, now I have read your narrative, that so bold and so contriving a man--I
am forced to break off----

*****

You stood it out much better and longer--Here again comes my bustling, jealous mother!

*****

Don't be angry at yourself. Did you not do for the best at the time? As to your first fault,
the answering his letters; it was always incumbent upon you to assume the guardianship of such
a family, when the bravo of it had run riot, as he did, and brought himself into danger.

Except your mother, who has no will of her own, have any of them common sense?

Forgive me, my dear--Here is that stupid uncle Antony of yours. A pragmatical, conceited positive.--He
came yesterday, in a fearful pucker, and puffed, and blowed, and stumped about our hall and
parlour, while his message was carried up.

My mother was dressing. These widows are as starched as the old bachelors. She would not see
him in a dishabille for the world--What can she mean by it?

His errand was to set her against you, and to shew her their determined rage on your going
away. The issue proved too evidently that this was the principal end of his visit.

The odd creature desired to speak with her alone. I am not used to such exceptions whenever
any visits are made to my mother.

When she was primed out, down she came to him. They locked themselves in. The two positive
heads were put together--close together I suppose; for I listened, but could hear nothing distinctly,
though they both seemed full of their subject.

I had a good mind, once or twice, to have made them open the door. Could I have been sure of
keeping but tolerably my temper, I would have demanded admittance. But I was afraid, if I had
obtained it, that I should have forgot it was my mother's house, and been for turning him out
of it. To come to rave against and abuse my dearest, dearest, faultless friend! and the ravings
to be encouraged, and perhaps joined in, in order to justify themselves; the one for contributing
to drive that dear friend out of her father's house; the other for refusing her a temporary
asylum, till the reconciliation could have been effected, which her dutiful heart was set upon;
and which it would have become the love which my mother had ever pretended for you, to have
mediated for--Could I have had patience!

The issue, as I said, shewed what the errand was--Its fusty appearance, after the old fusty
fellow was marched off, [you must excuse me, my dear,] was in a kind of gloomy, Harlowe-like
reservedness in my mother; which upon a few resenting flirts of mine, was followed by a rigorous
prohibition of correspondence.

This put us, you may suppose, upon terms not the most agreeable, I desired to know, if I were
prohibited dreaming of you?--For, my dear, you have all my sleeping as well as waking hours.

I can easily allow for your correspondence with your wretch at first (and yet your notions
were excellent) by the effect this prohibition has upon me; since, if possible, it has made
me love you better than before; and I am more desirous than ever of corresponding with you.

But I have nevertheless a much more laudable motive--I should think myself the unworthiest
of creatures, could I be brought to slight a dear friend, and such a meritorious one, in her
distress. I would die first--And so I told my mother. And I have desired her not to watch me
in my retired hours; nor to insist upon my lying with her constantly, which she now does more
earnestly than ever. 'Twere better, I told her, that the Harlowe-Betty were borrowed to be
set over me.

Mr. Hickman, who so greatly honours you, has, unknown to me, interposed so warmly in your favour
with my mother, that it makes for him no small merit with me.

I cannot, at present, write to every particular, unless I would be in set defiance. Tease,
tease, tease, for ever! The same thing, though answered fifty times over, in every hour to
be repeated--Lord bless me! what a life must my poor father--But let me remember to whom I
am writing.

If this ever-active, ever-mischievous monkey of a man, this Lovelace, contrived as you suspect--But
here comes my mother again--Ay, stay a little longer, my Mamma, if you please--I can but be
suspected! I can but be chidden for making you wait; and chidden I am sure to be, whether I
do or not, in the way you, my good Mamma, are Antony'd into.

Bless me! how impatient she is! How she thunders at the door! This moment, Madam! How came
I to double-lock myself if! What have I done with the key! Duce take the key! Dear Madam! You
flutter one so!

*****

You may believe, my dear, that I took care of my papers before I opened the door. We have had
a charming dialogue--She flung from me in a passion--

So--What's now to be done? Sent for down in a very peremptory manner, I assure you. What an
incoherent letter will you have, when I get it to you! But now I know where to send it, Mr.
Hickman shall find me a messenger. Yet, if he be detected, poor soul, he will be Harlowed-off,
as well as his meek mistress.

THURSDAY, APRIL 13.

I have this moment your continuation-letter. And am favoured, at present, with the absence
of my Argus-eyes mother.--

Dear creature! I can account for all your difficulties. A young lady of your delicacy!--And
with such a man!--I must be brief----

The man's a fool, my dear, with all his pride, and with all his complaisance, and affected
regards to your injunctions. Yet his ready inventions----

Sometimes I think you should go to Lady Betty's. I know not what to advise you to do.--I should,
if you were not so intent upon reconciling yourself to your relations. Yet they are implacable.
You can have no hopes of them. Your uncle's errand to my mother may convince you of that; ad
if you have an answer to your letter to your sister, that will confirm you, I dare say.

You need not to have been afraid of asking me, Whether upon reading your narrative, I thought
any extenuation could lie for what you have done! I have, as above, before I had your question,
told you my mind as to that. And I repeat, I think, your provocations and inducements considered,
that ever young creature was who took such a step.

But you took it not--You were driven on one side, and, possibly, tricked on the other.--If
any woman on earth shall be circumstanced as you were, and shall hold out so long as you did,
against her persecutors on one hand, and her seducer on the other, I will forgive her for all
the rest of her conduct, be it what it will.

All your acquaintance, you may suppose, talk of nobody but you. Some indeed bring your admirable
character for a plea against you: but nobody does, or can, acquit your father and uncles.

Every body seems apprized of your brother's and sister's motives. Your flight is, no doubt,
the very thing they aimed to drive you to, by the various attacks they made upon you; unhoping
(as they must do all the time) the success of their schemes in Solmes's behalf. They knew,
that if once you were restored to favour, the suspended love of your father and uncles, like
a river breaking down a temporary obstruction, would return with double force; and that then
you would expose, and triumph over all their arts.--And now, I hear they enjoy their successful
malice.

Your father is all rage and violence. He ought, I am sure, to turn his rage inward. All your
family accuse you of acting with deep art; and are put upon supposing that you are actually
every hour exulting over them, with your man, in the success of it.

They all pretend now, that your trial of Wednesday was to be the last.

Advantage would indeed, my mother owns, have been taken of your yielding, if you had yielded.
But had you not been prevailed upon, they would have given up their scheme, and taken your
promise for renouncing Lovelace--Believe them who will!

They own, however, that a minister was to be present--Mr. Solmes was to be at hand--And your
father was previously to try his authority over you, in order to make you sign the settlements--All
of it a romantic contrivance of your wild-headed foolish brother, I make no doubt. It is likely
that he and Bell would have given way to your restoration to favour, supposing it in their
power to hinder it, on any other terms than those their hearts had been so long set upon?

How they took your flight, when they found it out, may be better supposed than described.

Your aunt Hervey, it seems, was the first that went down to the ivy summer-house, in order
to acquaint you that their search was over. Betty followed her; and they not finding you there,
went on towards the cascade, according to a hint of yours.

Returning by the garden-door, they met a servant [they don't say, it was Joseph Leman; but
it is very likely that it was he] running, as he said, from pursuing Mr. Lovelace (a great
hedge-stake in his hand, and out of breath) to alarm the family.

If it were this fellow, and if he were employed in the double agency of cheating them, and
cheating you, what shall we think of the wretch you are with? Run away from him, my dear, if
so--no matter to whom--or marry him, if you cannot.

Your aunt and all your family were accordingly alarmed by this fellow--evidently when too late
for pursuit. They got together, and when a posse, ran to the place of interview; and some of
them as far as to the tracks of the chariot wheels, without stopping. And having heard the
man's tale upon the spot, a general lamentation, a mutual upbraiding, and rage, and grief,
were echoed from the different persons, according to their different tempers and conceptions.
And they returned like fools as they went.

Your brother, at first, ordered horses and armed men to be got ready for a pursuit. Solmes
and your uncle Tony were to be of the party. But your mother and your aunt Hervey dissuaded
them from it, for fear of adding evil to evil; not doubting but Lovelace had taken measures
to support himself in what he had done; and especially when the servant declared, that he saw
you run with him as fast as you could set foot to the ground; and that there were several armed
men on horseback at a small distance off.

*****

My mother's absence was owing to her suspicion, that the Knolly's were to assist in our correspondence.
She made them a visit upon it. She does every thing at once. And they have promised, that no
more letters shall be left there, without her knowledge.

But Mr. Hickman has engaged one Filmer, a husbandman in the lane we call Finch-lane, near us,
to receive them. Thither you will be pleased to direct yours, under cover, to Mr. John Soberton;
and Mr. Hickman himself will call for them there; and there shall leave mine. It goes against
me too, to make him so useful to me. He looks already so proud upon it! I shall have him [Who
knows?] give himself airs--He had best consider, that the favour he has been long aiming at,
may put him into a very dangerous, a very ticklish situation. He that can oblige, may disoblige--Happy
for some people not to have it in their power to offend!

I will have patience, if I can, for a while, to see if these bustlings in my mother will subside--but
upon my word, I will not long bear this usage.

Sometimes I am ready to think, that my mother carries it thus on purpose to tire me out, and
to make me the sooner marry. If I find it to be so, and that Hickman, in order to make a merit
with me, is in the low plot, I will never bear him in my sight.

Plotting wretch, as I doubt your man is, I wish to heaven that you were married, that you might
brave them all, and not be forced to hide yourself, and be hurried from one inconvenient place
to another. I charge you, omit not to lay hold on any handsome opportunity that may offer for
that purpose.

Here again comes my mother--

*****

We look mighty glum upon each other, I can tell you. She had not best Harlowe me at this rate--I
won't bear it.

I have a vast deal to write. I know not what to write first. Yet my mind is full, and ready
to run over.

I am got into a private corner of the garden, to be out of her way.--Lord help these mothers!--Do
they think they can prevent a daughter's writing, or doing any thing she has a mind to do,
by suspicion, watchfulness, and scolding?--They had better place a confidence in one by half--A
generous mind scorns to abuse a generous confidence.

You have a nice, a very nice part to act with this wretch--who yet has, I think, but one plain
path before him. I pity you--but you must make the best of the lot you have been forced to
draw. Yet I see your difficulties.--But, if he do not offer to abuse your confidence, I would
have you seem at least to place some in him.

If you think not of marrying soon, I approve of your resolution to fix somewhere out of his
reach. And if he know not where to find you, so much the better. Yet I verily believe, they
would force you back, could they but come at you, if they were not afraid of him.

I think, by all means, you should demand of both your trustees to be put in possession of your
own estate. Mean time I have sixty guineas at your service. I beg you will command them. Before
they are gone, I'll take care you shall be further supplied. I don't think you'll have a shilling
or a shilling's worth of your own from your relations, unless you extort it from them.

As they believe you went away by your own consent, they are, it seems, equally surprised and
glad that you have left your jewels and money behind you, and have contrived for clothes so
ill. Very little likelihood this shews of their answering your requests.

Indeed every one who knows not what I now know, must be at a loss to account for your flight,
as they will call it. And how, my dear, can one report it with any tolerable advantage to you?--To
say, you did not intend it when you met him, who will believe it?--To say, that a person of
your known steadiness and punctilio was over-persuaded when you gave him the meeting, how will
that sound?--To say, you were tricked out of yourself, and people were given credit to it,
how disreputable!--And while unmarried, and yet with him, the man a man of such a character,
what would it not lead a censuring world to think?

I want to see how you put it in your letter for your clothes.

As you may depend upon all the little spiteful things they can offer, instead of sending what
you write for, pray accept the sum that I tender. What will seen guineas do?--And I will find
a way to send you also any of my clothes and linen for present supply. I beg, my dear Clarissa,
that you will not put your Anna Howe upon a footing with Lovelace, in refusing to accept of
my offer. If you do not oblige me, I shall be apt to think you rather incline to be obliged
to him, than to favour me. And if I find this, I shall not know how to reconcile it with your
delicacy in other respects.

Pray inform me of every thing that passes between you and him. My cares for you (however needless,
from your own prudence) make me wish you to continue to be every minute. If any thing occur
that you would tell me of if I were present, fail not to put it down in writing, although from
your natural diffidence, it should not appear to you altogether so worthy of your pen, or my
knowing. A stander-by may see more of the game than one that plays. Great consequences, like
great folks, generally owe their greatness to small causes, and little incidents.

Upon the whole, I do not now think it is in your power to dismiss him when you please. I apprized
you beforehand, that it would not. I repeat, therefore, that were I you, I would at least seem
to place some confidence in him. So long as he is decent, you may. Very visibly observable,
to such delicacy as yours, must be that behaviour in him, which will make him unworthy of some
confidence.

Your relations, according to what old Antony says to my mother, and she to me, (by way of threatening,
that you will not gain your supposed ends upon them by your flight,) seem to expect that you
will throw yourself into Lady Betty's protection; and that she will offer to mediate for you.
And they vow, that they will never hearken to any terms of accommodation that shall come from
that quarter; for I dare aver, that your brother and sister will not let them cool--at least,
till their uncles have made such dispositions, and perhaps your father too, as they would have
them make.

As this letter will apprize you of an alteration in the place to which you must direct your
next, I send it by a friend of Mr. Hickman, who may be depended upon. He has business in the
neighbourhood of Mrs. Sorlings; and he knows her. He will return to Mr. Hickman this night;
and bring back any letter you shall have ready to send, or can get ready. It is moon-light.
He'll not mind waiting for you. I choose not to send by any of Mr. Hickman's servants--at present,
however. Every hour is now, or may be, important; and may make an alteration in your resolutions
necessary.

I hear at this instant, my mother calling about her, and putting every body into motion. She
will soon, I suppose, make me and my employment the subjects of her inquiry.

Adieu, my dear. May heaven preserve you, and restore you with honour as unsullied as your mind to

Your ever affectionate ANNA HOWE.

LETTER IX

MISS CLARISSA HARLOWE, TO MISS HOWE THURSDAY AFTERNOON, APRIL 13.

I am infinitely concerned, my ever dear and ever kind friend, that I am the sad occasion of
the displeasure between your mother and you.--How many persons have I made unhappy.

Had I not to console myself, that my error is not owing to wicked precipitation, I should be
the most miserable of all creatures. As it is, I am enough punished in the loss of my character,
more valuable to me than my life; and in the cruel doubts and perplexities which, conflicting
with my hopes, and each getting the victory by turns, harrow up my soul between them.

I think, however, that you should obey your mother, and decline a correspondence with me; at
least for the present. Take care how you fall into my error; for that begun with carrying on
a prohibited correspondence; a correspondence which I thought it in my power to discontinue
at pleasure. My talent is scribbling; and I the readier fell into this freedom, as I found
delight in writing; having motives too, which I thought laudable; and, at one time, the permission
of all my friends; to write to him.*

     * See Vol. I. Letter III.

Yet, as to this correspondence, What hurt could arise from it, if your mother could be prevailed
upon to permit it to be continued?--So much prudence and discretion as you have; and you, in
writing to me, lying under no temptation of following so bad an example as I have set--my letters
too occasionally filled with self-accusation.

I thank you, my dear, most cordially I thank you, for your kind offers. You may be assured,
that I will sooner be beholden to you, than to any body living. To Mr. Lovelace the last. Do
not therefore think, that by declining your favours, I have an intention to lay myself under
obligations to him.

I am willing to hope (notwithstanding what you write) that my friends will send me my little
money, together with my clothes. They are too considerate, some of them at least, to permit
that I should be put to such low difficulties. Perhaps, they will not be in haste to oblige
me. But, if not, I cannot yet want. I believe you think, I must not dispute with Mr. Lovelace
the expenses of the road and lodgings, till I can get a fixed abode. But I hope soon to put
an end even to those small sort of obligations.

Small hopes indeed of a reconciliation from your account of my uncle's visit to your mother,
in order to set her against an almost friendless creature whom once he loved! But is it not
my duty to try for it? Ought I to widen my error by obstinacy and resentment, because of their
resentment; which must appear reasonable to them, as they suppose my flight premeditated; and
as they are made to believe, that I am capable of triumphing in it, and over them, with the
man they hate? When I have done all in my power to restore myself to their favour, I shall
have the less to reproach myself with.

These considerations make me waver about following your advice, in relation to marriage; and
the rather, as he is so full of complaisance with regard to my former conditions, which he
calls my injunctions. Nor can I now, that my friends, as you inform me, have so strenuously
declared against accepting of the mediation of the ladies of Mr. Lovelace's family, put myself
into their protection, unless I am resolved to give up all hopes of a reconciliation with my own.

Yet if any happy introduction could be thought of to effect this desirable purpose, how shall
terms be proposed to my father, while this man is with me, or near me? On the other hand, should
they in his absence get me back by force, (and this, you are of opinion, they would attempt
to do, but in fear of him,) how will their severest acts of compulsion be justified by my flight
from them!--Mean while, to what censures, as you remind me, do I expose myself, while he and
I are together and unmarried!--Yet [can I with patience ask the question?] Is it in my power?--O
my dear Miss Howe! And am I so reduced, as that, to save the poor remains of my reputation
in the world's eye, I must watch the gracious motion from this man's lips?

Were my cousin Morden in England, all might still perhaps be determined happily.

If no other mediation than this can be procured to set on foot the wished-for reconciliation,
and if my situation with Mr. Lovelace alter not in the interim, I must endeavour to keep myself
in a state of independence till he arrive, that I may be at liberty to govern myself by his
advice and direction.

I will acquaint you, as you desire, with all that passes between Mr. Lovelace and me. Hitherto
I have not discovered any thing in his behaviour that is very exceptionable. Yet I cannot say,
that I think the respect he shews me, an easy, unrestrained, and natural respect, although
I can hardly tell where the fault is.

But he has doubtless an arrogant and encroaching spirit. Nor is he so polite as his education,
and other advantages, might have made one expect him to be. He seems, in short, to be one,
who has always had too much of his own will to study to accommodate himself to that of others.

As to the placing of some confidence in him, I shall be as ready to take your advice in this
particular, as in all others, and as he will be to deserve it. But tricked away as I was by
him, not only against my judgment, but my inclination, can he, or any body, expect, that I
should immediately treat him with complaisance, as if I acknowledged obligation to him for
carrying me away?--If I did, must he not either think he a vile dissembler before he gained
that point, or afterwards?

Indeed, indeed, my dear, I could tear my hair, on reconsidering what you write (as to the probability
that the dreaded Wednesday was more dreaded than it needed to be) to think, that I should be
thus tricked by this man; and that, in all likelihood, through his vile agent Joseph Leman.
So premeditated and elaborate a wickedness as it must be!--Must I not, with such a man, be
wanting to myself, if I were not jealous and vigilant?--Yet what a life to live for a spirit
so open, and naturally so unsuspicious, as mine?

I am obliged to Mr. Hickman for the assistance he is so kindly ready to give to our correspondence.
He is so little likely to make to himself an additional merit with the daughter upon it, that
I shall be very sorry, if he risk any thing with the mother by it.

I am now in a state of obligation: so must rest satisfied with whatever I cannot help. Whom
have I the power, once so precious to me, of obliging?--What I mean, my dear, is, that I ought,
perhaps, to expect, that my influences over you are weakened by my indiscretion. Nevertheless,
I will not, if I can help it, desert myself, nor give up the privilege you used to allow me,
of telling you what I think of such parts of your conduct as I may not approve.

You must permit me therefore, severe as your mother is against an undesigning offender, to
say that I think your liveliness to her inexcusable--to pass over, for this time, what nevertheless
concerns me not a little, the free treatment you almost indiscriminately give to my relations.

If you will not, for your duty's sake, forbear your tauntings and impatience, let me beseech
you, that you will for mine.--Since otherwise, your mother may apprehend that my example, like
a leaven, is working itself into the mind of her beloved daughter. And may not such an apprehension
give her an irreconcilable displeasure against me?

I enclose the copy of my letter to my sister, which you are desirous to see. You will observe,
that although I have not demanded my estate in form, and of my trustees, yet that I have hinted
at leave to retire to it. How joyfully would I keep my word, if they would accept of the offer
I renew!--It was not proper, I believe you will think, on many accounts, to own that I was
carried off against my inclination. I am, my dearest friend,

Your ever obliged and affectionate, CL. HARLOWE.

LETTER X

TO MISS ARABELLA HARLOWE [ENCLOSED TO MISS HOWE IN THE PRECEDING.] ST. ALBAN'S, APR. 11.

MY DEAR SISTER,

I have, I confess, been guilty of an action which carries with it a rash and undutiful appearance.
And I should have thought it an inexcusable one, had I been used with less severity than I
have been of late; and had I not had too great reason to apprehend, that I was to be made a
sacrifice to a man I could not bear to think of. But what is done, is done--perhaps I could
wish it had not; and that I had trusted to the relenting of my dear and honourable parents.--Yet
this from no other motives but those of duty to them.--To whom I am ready to return (if I may
not be permitted to retire to The Grove) on conditions which I before offered to comply with.

Nor shall I be in any sort of dependence upon the person by whose means I have taken this truly-reluctant
step, inconsistent with any reasonable engagement I shall enter into, if I am not further precipitated.
Let me not have it to say, now at this important crisis! that I have a sister, but not a friend
in that sister. My reputation, dearer to me than life, (whatever you may imagine from the step
I have taken,) is suffering. A little lenity will, even yet, in a great measure, restore it,
and make that pass for a temporary misunderstanding only, which otherwise will be a stain as
durable as life, upon a creature who has already been treated with great unkindness, to use
no harsher a word.

For your own sake therefore, for my brother's sake, by whom (I must say) I have been thus precipitated,
and for all the family's sake, aggravate not my fault, if, on recollecting every thing, you
think it one; nor by widening the unhappy difference, expose a sister for ever--prays

Your affectionate CL. HARLOWE.

I shall take it for a very great favour to have my clothes directly sent me, together with
fifty guineas, which you will find in my escritoire (of which I enclose the key); as also of
the divinity and miscellany classes of my little library; and, if it be thought fit, my jewels--directed
for me, to be left till called for, at Mr. Osgood's, near Soho-square.

LETTER XI

MR. LOVELACE, TO JOHN BELFORD, ESQ.

     Mr. Lovelace, in continuation of his last letter, (No. VII.)
     gives an account to his friend (pretty much to the same
     effect with the lady's) of all that passed between them at
     the inns, in the journey, and till their fixing at Mrs.
     Sorling's; to avoid repetition, those passages in his
     narrative are extracted, which will serve to embellish
     her's; to open his views; or to display the humourous talent
     he was noted for.

     At their alighting at the inn at St. Alban's on Monday
     night, thus he writes:

The people who came about us, as we alighted, seemed by their jaw-fallen faces, and goggling
eyes, to wonder at beholding a charming young lady, majesty in her air and aspect, so composedly
dressed, yet with features so discomposed, come off a journey which made the cattle smoke,
and the servants sweat. I read their curiosity in their faces, and my beloved's uneasiness
in her's. She cast a conscious glance, as she alighted, upon her habit, which was no habit;
and repulsively, as I may say, quitting my assisting hand, hurried into the house.*****

Ovid was not a greater master of metamorphoses than thy friend. To the mistress of the house
I instantly changed her into a sister, brought off by surprise from a near relation's, (where
she had wintered,) to prevent her marrying a confounded rake, [I love always to go as near
the truth as I can,] whom her father and mother, her elder sister, and all her loving uncles,
aunts, and cousins abhorred. This accounted for my charmer's expected sullens; for her displeasure
when she was to join me again, were it to hold; for her unsuitable dress upon the road; and,
at the same time, gave her a proper and seasonable assurance of my honourable views.

Upon the debate between the lady and him, and particularly upon that
part   where she upbraids him with putting a young creature upon making a
   sacrifice of her duty and conscience, he write:

All these, and still more mortifying things, she said.

I heard her in silence. But when it came to my turn, I pleaded, I argued, I answered her, as
well as I could.--And when humility would not do, I raised my voice, and suffered my eyes to
sparkle with anger; hoping to take advantage of that sweet cowardice which is so amiable in
the sex, and to which my victory over this proud beauty is principally owing.

She was not intimidated, however, and was going to rise upon me in her temper; and would have
broken in upon my defence. But when a man talks to a woman upon such subjects, let her be ever
so much in alt, 'tis strange, if he cannot throw out a tub to the whale;--that is to say, if
he cannot divert her from resenting one bold thing, by uttering two or three full as bold;
but for which more favourable interpretations will lie.

     To that part, where she tells him of the difficulty she made
     to correspond with him at first, thus he writes:

Very true, my precious!--And innumerable have been the difficulties thou hast made me struggle
with. But one day thou mayest wish, that thou hadst spared this boast; as well as those other
pretty haughtinesses, 'That thou didst not reject Solmes for my sake: that my glory, if I valued
myself upon carrying thee off, was thy shame: that I have more merit with myself than with
thee, or any body else: [what a coxcomb she makes me, Jack!] that thou wishest thyself in thy
father's house again, whatever were to be the consequence.'--If I forgive thee, charmer, for
these hints, for these reflections, for these wishes, for these contempts, I am not the Lovelace
I have been reputed to be; and that thy treatment of me shews that thou thinkest I am.

In short, her whole air throughout this debate expressed a majestic kind of indignation, which
implied a believed superiority of talents over the person to whom she spoke.

Thou hast heard me often expatiate upon the pitiful figure a man must make, whose wife has,
or believes she has, more sense than himself. A thousand reasons could I give why I ought not
to think of marrying Miss Clarissa Harlowe; at least till I can be sure, that she loves me
with the preference I must expect from a wife.

I begin to stagger in my resolutions. Ever averse as I was to the hymeneal shackles, how easily
will prejudices recur! Heaven give me the heart to be honest to my Clarissa!--There's a prayer,
Jack! If I should not be heard, what a sad thing would that be, for the most admirable of women!--Yet,
as I do no often trouble Heaven with my prayers, who knows but this may be granted?

But there lie before me such charming difficulties, such scenery for intrigue, for stratagem,
for enterprize. What a horrible thing, that my talents point all that way!--When I know what
is honourable and just; and would almost wish to be honest?--Almost, I say; for such a varlet
am I, that I cannot altogether wish it, for the soul of me!--Such a triumph over the whole
sex, if I can subdue this lady! My maiden vow, as I may call it!--For did not the sex begin
with me? And does this lady spare me? Thinkest thou, Jack, that I should have spared my Rosebud,
had I been set at defiance thus?--Her grandmother besought me, at first, to spare her Rosebud:
and when a girl is put, or puts herself into a man's power, what can he wish for further? while
I always considered opposition and resistance as a challenge to do my worst.*

     * See Vol. I. Letter XXXIV.

Why, why, will the dear creature take such pains to appear all ice to me?--Why will she, by
her pride, awaken mine?--Hast thou not seen, in the above, how contemptibly she treats me?--What
have I not suffered for her, and even from her!--Ought I to bear being told, that she will
despise me, if I value myself above that odious Solmes?

Then she cuts me short in all my ardours. To vow fidelity, is by a cursed turn upon me, to
shew, that there is reason, in my own opinion, for doubt of it. The very same reflection upon
me once before.*

     * See Vol. II. Letter XIII.

In my power, or out of my power, all one to this lady.--So, Belford, my poor vows are crammed
down my throat, before they can well rise to my lips. And what can a lover say to his mistress,
if she will neither let him lie nor swear?

One little piece of artifice I had recourse to: When she pushed so hard for me to leave her,
I made a request to her, upon a condition she could not refuse; and pretended as much gratitude
upon her granting it, as if it were a favour of the last consequence.

And what was this? but to promise what she had before promised, 'Never to marry any other man,
while I am living, and single, unless I should give her cause for high disgust against me.'
This, you know, was promising nothing, because she could be offended at any time, and was to
be the sole judge of the offence. But it shewed her how reasonable and just my expectations
were; and that I was no encroacher.

She consented; and asked what security I expected? Her word only.

She gave me her word: but I besought her excuse for sealing it: and in the same moment (since
to have waited for consent would have been asking for a denial) saluted her. And, believe me,
or not, but, as I hope to live, it was the first time I had the courage to touch her charming
lips with mine. And this I tell thee, Belford, that that single pressure (as modestly put too,
as if I were as much a virgin as herself, that she might not be afraid of me another time)
delighted me more than ever I was delighted by the ultimatum with any other woman.--So precious
do awe, reverence, and apprehended prohibition, make a favour!

And now, Belford, I am only afraid that I shall be too cunning; for she does not at present
talk enough for me. I hardly know what to make of the dear creature yet.

I topt the brother's part on Monday night before the landlady at St. Alban's; asking my sister's
pardon for carrying her off so unprepared for a journey; prated of the joy my father and mother,
and all our friends, would have in receiving her; and this with so many circumstances, that
I perceived, by a look she gave me, that went through my very reins, that I had gone too far.
I apologized for it indeed when alone; but could not penetrate for the soul of me, whether
I made the matter better or worse by it.

But I am of too frank a nature: my success, and the joy I have because of the jewel I am half
in possession of, has not only unlocked my bosom, but left the door quite open.

This is a confounded sly sex. Would she but speak out, as I do--but I must learn reserves of her.

She must needs be unprovided of money: but has too much pride to accept of any from me. I would
have had her go to town [to town, if possible, must I get her to consent to go] in order to
provide herself with the richest of silks which that can afford. But neither is this to be
assented to. And yet, as my intelligencer acquaints me, her implacable relations are resolved
to distress her all they can.

These wretches have been most gloriously raving, ever since her flight; and still, thank Heaven,
continue to rave; and will, I hope, for a twelvemonth to come. Now, at last, it is my day!

Bitterly do they regret, that they permitted her poultry-visits, and garden-walks, which gave
her the opportunity to effect an escape which they suppose preconcerted. For, as to her dining
in the ivy-bower, they had a cunning design to answer upon her in that permission, as Betty
told Joseph her lover.*

     * Vol. II. Letter XLVII. paragr. 37, 38.

They lost, they say, and excellent pretence for confining her more closely on my threatening
to rescue her, if they offered to carry her against her will to old Antony's moated house.*
For this, as I told thee at the Hart, and as I once hinted to the dear creature herself,**
they had it in deliberation to do; apprehending, that I might attempt to carry her off, either
with or without her consent, on some one of those connived-at excursions.

     * Ibid. Let. XXXVI. and Let. XXXIX. par. I.
    ** Ibid. Let. XXXVI. par. 4. See also Let. XV. par. 3.

But here my honest Joseph, who gave me the information, was of admirable service to me. I had
taught him to make the Harlowes believe, that I was as communicative to my servants, as their
stupid James was to Joseph:* Joseph, as they supposed, by tampering with Will,** got all my
secrets, and was acquainted with all my motions: and having also undertaken to watch all those
of his young lady,***** the wise family were secure; and so was my beloved; and so was I.

     * Ibid. Letter XLVII. par. 6, and 39.
** This will be farther explained in Letter XXI. of this volume. *****
See Vol. I. Letters XXXI. and XXXIV.

I once had it in my head (and I hinted it to thee* in a former) in case such a step should
be necessary, to attempt to carry her off by surprise from the wood-house; as it is remote
from the dwelling-house. This, had I attempted, I should have certainly effected, by the help
of the confraternity: and it would have been an action worthy of us all.--But Joseph's conscience,
as he called it, stood in my way; for he thought it must have been known to be done by his
connivance. I could, I dare say, have overcome this scruple, as easily as I did many of the
others, had I not depended at one time upon her meeting me at midnight or late hour [and, if
she had, she never would have gone back]; at other times, upon the cunning family's doing my
work for me, equally against their knowledge or their wills.

     * See Vol. I. Letter XXXV.

For well I knew, that James and Arabella were determined never to leave off their foolish trials
and provocations, till, by tiring her out, they had either made her Solmes's wife, or guilty
of some such rashness as should throw her for ever out of the favour of both her uncles; though
they had too much malice in their heads to intend service to me by their persecutions of her.

LETTER XII

MR. LOVELACE, TO JOHN BELFORD, ESQ. [IN CONTINUATION.]

I obliged the dear creature highly, I could perceive, by bringing Mrs. Greme to attend her,
and to suffer that good woman's recommendation of lodgings to take place, on her refusal to
go to The Lawn.

She must believe all my views to be honourable, when I had provided for her no particular lodgings,
leaving it to her choice, whether she would go to M. Hall, to The Lawn, to London, or to either
of the dowagers of my family.

She was visibly pleased with my motion of putting Mrs. Greme into the chaise with her, and
riding on horseback myself.

Some people would have been apprehensive of what might pass between her and Mrs. Greme. But
as all my relations either know or believe the justice of my intentions by her, I was in no
pain on that account; and the less, as I have always been above hypocrisy, or wishing to be
thought better than I am. And indeed, what occasion has a man to be an hypocrite, who has hitherto
found his views upon the sex better answered for his being known to be a rake? Why, even my
beloved here denied not to correspond with me, though her friends had taught her to think me
a libertine--Who then would be trying a new and worse character?

And then Mrs. Greme is a pious matron, and would not have been biased against truth on any
consideration. She used formerly, while there were any hopes of my reformation, to pray for
me. She hardly continues the good custom, I doubt; for her worthy lord makes no scruple occasionally
to rave against me to man, woman, and child, as they come in his way. He is very undutiful,
as thou knowest. Surely, I may say so; since all duties are reciprocal. But for Mrs. Greme,
poor woman! when my lord has the gout, and is at The Lawn, and the chaplain not to be found,
she prays by him, or reads a chapter to him in the Bible, or some other good book.

Was it not therefore right to introduce such a good sort of woman to the dear creature; and
to leave them, without reserve, to their own talk!--And very busy in talk I saw they were,
as they rode; and felt it too; for most charmingly glowed my cheeks.

I hope I shall be honest, I once more say: but as we frail mortals are not our own masters
at all times, I must endeavour to keep the dear creature unapprehensive, until I can get her
to our acquaintance's in London, or to some other safe place there. Should I, in the interim,
give her the least room for suspicion; or offer to restrain her; she can make her appeals to
strangers, and call the country in upon me; and, perhaps, throw herself upon her relations
on their own terms. And were I now to lose her, how unworthy should I be to be the prince and
leader of such a confraternity as ours!--How unable to look up among men! or to shew my face
among women!

As things at present stand, she dare not own that she went off against her own consent; and
I have taken care to make all the implacables believe, that she escaped with it.

She has received an answer from Miss Howe, to the letter written to her from St. Alban's.*

     * See Vol. II. Letter XLVIII.

Whatever are the contents, I know not; but she was drowned in tears on the perusal of it. And
I am the sufferer.

Miss Howe is a charming creature too; but confoundedly smart and spiritful. I am a good deal
afraid of her. Her mother can hardly keep her in. I must continue to play off old Antony, by
my honest Joseph, upon that mother, in order to manage that daughter, and oblige my beloved
to an absolute dependence upon myself.*

     * See Vol. I. Letter XXXI.

Mrs. Howe is impatient of contradiction. So is Miss. A young lady who is sensible that she
has all the materials requisites herself, to be under maternal controul;--fine ground for a
man of intrigue to build upon!--A mother over-notable; a daughter over-sensible; and their
Hickman, who is--over-neither: but merely a passive--

Only that I have an object still more desirable--!

Yet how unhappy, that these two young ladies lived so near each other, and are so well acquainted!
Else how charmingly might I have managed them both!

But one man cannot have every woman worth having--Pity though--when the man is such a VERY
clever fellow!

LETTER XIII

MR. LOVELACE, TO JOHN BELFORD, ESQ. [IN CONTINUATION.]

Never was there such a pair of scribbling lovers as we;--yet perhaps whom it so much concerns
to keep from each other what each writes. She won't have any thing else to do. I would, if
she'd let me. I am not reformed enough for a husband.--Patience is a virtue, Lord M. says.
Slow and sure, is another of his sentences. If I had not a great deal of that virtue, I should
not have waited the Harlowes own time of ripening into execution my plots upon themselves and
upon their goddess daughter.

My beloved has been writing to her saucy friend, I believe, all that has befallen her, and
what has passed between us hitherto. She will possibly have fine subjects for her pen, if she
be as minute as I am.

I would not be so barbarous as to permit old Antony to set Mrs. Howe against her, did I not
dread the consequences of the correspondence between the two young ladies. So lively the one,
so vigilant, so prudent both, who would not wish to outwit such girls, and to be able to twirl
them round his finger?

My charmer has written to her sister for her clothes, for some gold, and for some of her books.
What books can tell her more than she knows? But I can. So she had better study me.

She may write. She must be obliged to me at last, with all her pride. Miss Howe indeed will
be ready enough to supply her; but I question, whether she can do it without her mother, who
is as covetous as the grave. And my agent's agent, old Antony, has already given the mother
a hint which will make her jealous of pecuniaries.

Besides, if Miss Howe has money by her, I can put her mother upon borrowing it of her: nor
blame me, Jack, for contrivances that have their foundation in generosity. Thou knowest my
spirit; and that I should be proud to lay an obligation upon my charmer to the amount of half,
nay, to the whole of my estate. Lord M. has more for me than I can ever wish for. My predominant
passion is girl, not gold; nor value I this, but as it helps me to that, and gives me independence.

I was forced to put it into the sweet novice's head, as well for my sake as for hers (lest
we should be traceable by her direction) whither to direct the sending of her clothes, if they
incline to do her that small piece of justice.

If they do I shall begin to dread a reconciliation; and must be forced to muse for a contrivance
or two to prevent it, and to avoid mischief. For that (as I have told honest Joseph Leman)
is a great point with me.

Thou wilt think me a sad fellow, I doubt. But are not all rakes sad fellows?--And art not thou,
to thy little power, as bad as any? If thou dost all that's in thy head and in thy heart to
do, thou art worse than I; for I do not, I assure you.

I proposed, and she consented, that her clothes, or whatever else her relations should think
fit to send her, should be directed to thy cousin Osgood's. Let a special messenger, at my
charge, bring me any letter, or portable parcel, that shall come. If not portable, give me
notice of it. But thou'lt have no trouble of this sort from her relations, I dare be sworn.
And in this assurance, I will leave them, I think, to act upon their own heads. A man would
have no more to answer for than needs must.

But one thing, while I think of it; which is of great importance to be attended to--You must
hereafter write to me in character, as I shall do to you. It would be a confounded thing to
be blown up by a train of my own laying. And who knows what opportunities a man in love may
have against himself? In changing a coat or waistcoat, something might be forgotten. I once
suffered that way. Then for the sex's curiosity, it is but remembering, in order to guard against
it, that the name of their common mother was Eve.

Another thing remember; I have changed my name: changed it without an act of parliament. 'Robert
Huntingford' it is now. Continue Esquire. It is a respectable addition, although every sorry
fellow assumes it, almost to the banishment of the usual traveling one of Captain. 'To be left
till called for, at the post-house at Hertford.'

Upon naming thee, she asked thy character. I gave thee a better than thou deservest, in order
to do credit to myself. Yet I told her, that thou wert an awkward fellow; and this to do credit
to thee, that she may not, if ever she be to see thee, expect a cleverer man than she'll find.
Yet thy apparent awkwardness befriends thee not a little: for wert thou a sightly mortal, people
would discover nothing extraordinary in thee, when they conversed with thee: whereas, seeing
a bear, they are surprised to find in thee any thing that is like a man. Felicitate thyself
then upon thy defects; which are evidently thy principal perfections; and which occasion thee
a distinction which otherwise thou wouldst never have.

The lodgings we are in at present are not convenient. I was so delicate as to find fault with
them, as communicating with each other, because I knew she would; and told her, that were I
sure she was safe from pursuit, I would leave her in them, (since such was her earnest desire
and expectation,) and go to London.

She must be an infidel against all reason and appearances, if I do not banish even the shadow
of mistrust from her heart.

Here are two young likely girls, daughters of the widow Sorlings; that's the name of our landlady.

I have only, at present, admired them in their dairy-works. How greedily do the sex swallow
praise!--Did I not once, in the streets of London, see a well-dressed, handsome girl laugh,
bridle, and visibly enjoy the praises of a sooty dog, a chimney-sweeper; who, with his empty
sack across his shoulder, after giving her the way, stopt, and held up his brush and shovel
in admiration of her?--Egad, girl, thought I, I despise thee as Lovelace: but were I the chimney-sweeper,
and could only contrive to get into thy presence, my life to thy virtue, I would have thee.

So pleased was I with the young Sorlings, for the elegance of her works, that I kissed her,
and she made me a courtesy for my condescension; and blushed, and seemed sensible all over:
encouraging, yet innocently, she adjusted her handkerchief, and looked towards the door, as
much as to say, she would not tell, were I to kiss her again.

Her eldest sister popt upon her. The conscious girl blushed again, and looked so confounded,
that I made an excuse for her, which gratified both. Mrs. Betty, said I, I have been so much
pleased with the neatness of your dairy-works, that I could not help saluting your sister:
you have your share of merit in them, I am sure--Give me leave----

Good souls!--I like them both--she courtesied too!--How I love a grateful temper! O that my
Clarissa were but half so acknowledging!

I think I must get one of them to attend my charmer when she removes--the mother seems to be
a notable woman. She had not best, however, be too notable: since, were she by suspicion to
give me a face of difficulty to the matter, it would prepare me for a trial with one or both
the daughters.

Allow me a little rhodamantade, Jack--but really and truly my heart is fixed. I can think of
no creature breathing of the sex, but my Gloriana.

LETTER XIV

MR. LOVELACE, TO JOHN BELFORD, ESQ. [IN CONTINUATION.]

This is Wednesday; the day that I was to have lost my charmer for ever to the hideous Solmes!
With what high satisfaction and heart's-ease can I now sit down, and triumph over my men in
straw at Harlowe-place! Yet 'tis perhaps best for them, that she got off as she did. Who knows
what consequences might have followed upon my attending her in; or (if she had not met me)
upon my projected visit, followed by my myrmidons?

But had I even gone in with her unaccompanied, I think I had but little reason for apprehension:
for well thou knowest, that the tame spirits which value themselves upon reputation, and are
held within the skirts of the law by political considerations only, may be compared to an infectious
spider; which will run into his hole the moment one of his threads is touched by a finger that
can crush him, leaving all his toils defenceless, and to be brushed down at the will of the
potent invader. While a silly fly, that has neither courage nor strength to resist, no sooner
gives notice, by its buz and its struggles, of its being entangled, but out steps the self-circumscribed
tyrant, winds round and round the poor insect, till he covers it with his bowel-spun toils;
and when so fully secured, that it can neither move leg nor wing, suspends it, as if for a
spectacle to be exulted over: then stalking to the door of his cell, turns about, glotes over
it at a distance; and, sometimes advancing, sometimes retiring, preys at leisure upon its vitals.

But now I think of it, will not this comparison do as well for the entangled girls, as for
the tame spirits?--Better o' my conscience!--'Tis but comparing the spider to us brave fellows,
and it quadrates.

Whatever our hearts are in, our heads will follow. Begin with spiders, with flies, with what
we will, girl is the centre of gravity, and we all naturally tend to it.

Nevertheless, to recur; I cannot but observe, that these tame spirits stand a poor chance in
a fairly offensive war with such of us mad fellows as are above all law, and scorn to sculk
behind the hypocritical screen of reputation.

Thou knowest that I never scruple to throw myself amongst numbers of adversaries; the more
the safer: one or two, no fear, will take the part of a single adventurer, if not intentionally,
in fact; holding him in, while others hold in the principal antagonist, to the augmentation
of their mutual prowess, till both are prevailed upon to compromise, or one to be absent: so
that, upon the whole, the law-breakers have the advantage of the law-keepers, all the world
over; at least for a time, and till they have run to the end of their race. Add to this, in
the question between me and the Harlowes, that the whole family of them must know that they
have injured me--must therefore be afraid of me. Did they not, at their own church, cluster
together like bees, when they saw me enter it? Nor knew they which should venture out first,
when the service was over.

James, indeed, was not there. If he had, he would perhaps have endeavoured to look valiant.
But there is a sort of valour in the face, which shews fear in the heart: just such a face
would James Harlowe's have been, had I made them a visit.

When I have had such a face and such a heart as I have described to deal with, I have been
all calm and serene, and left it to the friends of the blusterer (as I have done to the Harlowes)
to do my work for me.

I am about mustering up in my memory, all that I have ever done, that has been thought praise-worthy,
or but barely tolerable. I am afraid thou canst not help me to many remembrances of this sort;
because I never was so bad as since I have known thee.

Have I not had it in my heart to do some good that thou canst not remind me of? Study for me,
Jack. I have recollected some instances which I think will tell in--but see if thou canst not
help me to some which I may have forgot.

This I may venture to say, that the principal blot in my escutcheon is owing to these girls,
these confounded girls. But for them, I could go to church with a good conscience: but when
I do, there they are. Every where does Satan spread his snares for me! But, how I think of
it, what if our governor should appoint churches for the women only, and others for the men?--Full
as proper, I think, for the promoting of true piety in both, [much better than the synagogue-lattices,]
as separate boarding-schools for their education.

There are already male and female dedications of churches.

St. Swithin's, St. Stephen's, St. Thomas's, St. George's, and so forth, might be appropriated
to the men; and Santa Catharina's, Santa Anna's, Santa Maria's, Santa Margaretta's, for the women.

Yet were it so, and life to be the forfeiture of being found at the female churches, I believe
that I, like a second Clodius, should change my dress, to come at my Portia or Pompeia, though
one the daughter of a Cato, the other the wife of a Caesar.

But how I excurse!--Yet thou usedst to say, thou likedst my excursions. If thou dost, thou'lt
have enow of them: for I never had a subject I so much adored; and with which I shall probably
be compelled to have so much patience before I strike the blow; if the blow I do strike.

But let me call myself back to my recordation-subject--Thou needest not remind me of my Rosebud.
I have her in my head; and moreover have contrived to give my fair-one an hint of that affair,
by the agency of honest Joseph Leman;* although I have not reaped the hoped-for credit of her
acknowledgement.

     * See Vol. II. Letter XXVII.

That's the devil; and it was always my hard fate--every thing I do that is good, is but as
I ought!--Every thing of a contrary nature is brought into the most glaring light against me--Is
this fair? Ought not a balance to be struck; and the credit carried to my account?--Yet I must
own too, that I half grudge Johnny this blooming maiden? for, in truth, I think a fine woman
too rich a jewel to hang about a poor man's neck.

Surely, Jack, if I am guilty of a fault in my universal adorations of the sex, the women in
general ought to love me the better for it.

And so they do; I thank them heartily; except here and there a covetous little rogue comes
cross me, who, under the pretence of loving virtue for its own sake, wants to have me all to
herself.

I have rambled enough.

Adieu, for the present.

LETTER XV

MISS CLARISSA HARLOWE, TO MISS HOWE THURSDAY NIGHT, APRIL 13.

I always loved writing, and my unhappy situation gives me now enough of it; and you, I fear,
too much. I have had another very warm debate with Mr. Lovelace. It brought on the subject
which you advised me not to decline, when it was handsomely offered. And I want to have either
your acquittal or blame for having suffered it to go off without effect.

The impatient wretch sent up to me several times, while I was writing my last to you, to desire
my company: yet his business nothing particular; only to hear him talk. The man seems pleased
with his own volubility; and, whenever he has collected together abundance of smooth things,
he wants me to find an ear for them! Yet he need not; for I don't often gratify him either
with giving him the praise for his verboseness, or shewing the pleasure in it that he would
be fond of.

When I had finished the letter, and given it to Mr. Hickman's friend, I was going up again,
and had got up half a dozen stairs; when he besought be to stop, and hear what he had to say.

Nothing, as I said, to any new purpose had he to offer; but complainings; and those in a manner,
and with an air, as I thought, that bordered upon insolence. He could not live, he told me,
unless he had more of my company, and of my indulgence too, that I had yet given him.

Hereupon I stept down, and into the parlour, not a little out of humour with him; and the more,
as he has very quietly taken up his quarters here, without talking of removing, as he had promised.

We began instantly our angry conference. He provoked me; and I repeated several of the plainest
things I had said in our former conversations; and particularly told him, that I was every
hour more and more dissatisfied with myself, and with him: that he was not a man, who, in my
opinion, improved upon acquaintance: and that I should not be easy till he had left me to myself.

He might be surprised at my warmth, perhaps: but really the man looked so like a simpleton,
hesitating, and having nothing to say for himself, or that should excuse the peremptoriness
of his demand upon me, (when he knew I had been writing a letter which a gentleman waited for,)
that I flung from him, declaring, that I would be mistress of my own time, and of my own actions,
and not to be called to account for either.

He was very uneasy till he could again be admitted into my company, and when I was obliged
to see him, which was sooner than I liked, never did the man put on a more humble and respectful
demeanor.

He told me, that he had, upon this occasion, been entering into himself, and had found a great
deal of reason to blame himself for an impertinency and inconsideration which, although he
meant nothing by it, must be very disagreeable to one of my delicacy. That having always aimed
at a manly sincerity and openness of heart, he had not till now discovered, that both were
very consistent with that true politeness, which he feared he had too much disregarded, while
he sought to avoid the contrary extreme; knowing, that in me he had to deal with a lady, who
despised an hypocrite, and who was above all flattery. But from this time forth, I should find
such an alteration in his whole behaviour, as might be expected from a man who knew himself
to be honoured with the presence and conversation of a person, who had the most delicate mind
in the world--that was his flourish.

I said, that he might perhaps expect congratulation upon the discovery he had just now made,
to wit, that true politeness and sincerity were reconcilable: but that I, who had, by a perverse
fate, been thrown into his company, had abundant reason to regret that he had not sooner found
this out.--Since, I believed, very few men of birth and education were strangers to it.

He knew not, neither, he said, that he had so badly behaved himself, as to deserve so very
severe a rebuke.

Perhaps not, I replied: but he might, if so, make another discovery from what I had said; which
might be to my own disadvantage: since, if he had so much reason to be satisfied with himself,
he would see what an ungenerous person he spoke to, who, when he seemed to give himself airs
of humility, which, perhaps he thought beneath him to assume, had not the civility to make
him a compliment upon them; but was ready to take him at his word.

He had long, with infinite pleasure, the pretended flattery-hater said, admired my superior
talents, and a wisdom in so young a lady, perfectly suprising.

Let me, Madam, said he, stand ever so low in your opinion, I shall believe all you say to be
just; and that I have nothing to do but to govern myself for the future by your example, and
by the standard you shall be pleased to give me.

I know better, Sir, replied I, than to value myself upon your volubility of speech. As you
pretend to pay so preferable a regard to sincerity, you shall confine yourself to the strict
rules of truth, when you speak of me, to myself: and then, although you shall be so kind as
to imagine that you have reason to make me a compliment, you will have much more to pride yourself
in those arts which have made so extraordinary a young creature so great a fool.

Really, my dear, the man deserves not politer treatment.--And then has he not made a fool,
an egregious fool of me?--I am afraid he himself thinks he has.

I am surprised! I am amazed, Madam, returned he, at so strange a turn upon me!--I am very unhappy,
that nothing I can do or say will give you a good opinion of me!--Would to heaven that I knew
what I can do to obtain the honour of your confidence!

I told him, that I desired his absence, of all things. I saw not, I said, that my friends thought
it worth their while to give me disturbance: therefore, if he would set out for London, or
Berkshire, or whither he pleased, it would be most agreeable to me, and most reputable too.

He would do so, he said, he intended to do so, the moment I was in a place to my liking--in
a place convenient for me.

This, Sir, will be so, said I, when you are not here to break in upon me, and make the apartments
inconvenient.

He did not think this place safe, he replied; and as I intended not to stay here, he had not
been so solicitous, as otherwise he should have been, to enjoin privacy to his servants, nor
to Mrs. Greme at her leaving me; that there were two or three gentlemen at the neighbourhood,
he said, with whose servants his gossiping fellows had scraped acquaintance: so that he could
not think of leaving me here unguarded and unattended.--But fix upon any place in England where
I could be out of danger, and he would go to the furthermost part of the king's dominions,
if by doing so he could make me easy.

I told him plainly that I should never be in humour with myself for meeting him; nor with him,
for seducing me away: that my regrets increased, instead of diminished: that my reputation
was wounded: that nothing I could do would now retrieve it: and that he must not wonder, if
I every hour grew more and more uneasy both with myself and him: that upon the whole, I was
willing to take care of myself; and when he had left me, I should best know what to resolve
upon, and whither to go.

He wished, he said, he were at liberty, without giving me offence, or being thought to intend
to infringe the articles I had stipulated and insisted upon, to make one humble proposal to
me. But the sacred regard he was determined to pay to all my injunctions (reluctantly as I
had on Monday last put it into his power to serve me) would not permit him to make it, unless
I would promise to excuse him, if I did not approve of it.

I asked, in some confusion, what he would say?

He prefaced and paraded on; and then out came, with great diffidence, and many apologies, and
a bashfulness which sat very awkwardly upon him, a proposal of speedy solemnization: which,
he said, would put all right; and make my first three or four months (which otherwise must
be passed in obscurity and apprehension) a round of visits and visitings to and from all his
relations; to Miss Howe; to whom I pleased: and would pave the way to the reconciliation I
had so much at heart.

Your advice had great weight with me just then, as well as his reasons, and the consideration
of my unhappy situation: But what could I say? I wanted somebody to speak for me.

The man saw I was not angry at his motion. I only blushed; and that I am sure I did up to the
ears; and looked silly, and like a fool.

He wants not courage. Would he have had me catch at his first, at his very first word?--I was
silent too--and do not the bold sex take silence for a mark of a favour!--Then, so lately in
my father's house! Having also declared to him in my letters, before I had your advice, that
I would not think of marriage till he had passed through a state of probation, as I may call
it--How was it possible I could encourage, with very ready signs of approbation, such an early
proposal? especially so soon after the free treatment he had provoked from me. If I were to
die, I could not.

He looked at me with great confidence; as if (notwithstanding his contradictory bashfulness)
he would look me through; while my eye but now-and-then could glance at him.--He begged my
pardon with great humility: he was afraid I would think he deserved no other answer, but that
of a contemptuous silence. True love was fearful of offending. [Take care, Mr. Lovelace, thought
I, how your's is tried by that rule]. Indeed so sacred a regard [foolish man!] would he have
to all my declarations made before I honoured him--

I would hear him no further; but withdrew in a confusion too visible, and left him to make
his nonsensical flourishes to himself.

I will only add, that, if he really wishes for a speedy solemnization, he never could have
had a luckier time to press for my consent to it. But he let it go off; and indignation has
taken place of it. And now it shall be a point with me, to get him at a distance from me.

I am, my dearest friend, Your ever faithful and obliged CL. H.

LETTER XVI

MR. LOVELACE, TO JOHN BELFORD, ESQ. TUESDAY, APR. 13.

Why, Jack, thou needest not make such a wonderment, as the girls say, if I should have taken
large strides already towards reformation: for dost thou not see, that while I have been so
assiduously, night and day, pursuing this single charmer, I have infinitely less to answer
for, than otherwise I should have had? Let me see, how many days and nights?--Forty, I believe,
after open trenches, spent in the sap only, and never a mine sprung yet!

By a moderate computation, a dozen kites might have fallen, while I have been only trying to
ensnare this single lark. Nor yet do I see when I shall be able to bring her to my lure: more
innocent days yet, therefore!--But reformation for my stalking-horse, I hope, will be a sure,
though a slow method to effect all my purposes.

Then, Jack, thou wilt have a merit too in engaging my pen, since thy time would be otherwise
worse employed: and, after all, who knows but by creating new habits, at the expense of the
old, a real reformation may be brought about? I have promised it; and I believe there is a
pleasure to be found in being good, reversing that of Nat. Lee's madman,

      --Which none but good men know.

By all this, seest thou not how greatly preferable it is, on twenty accounts, to pursue a difficult
rather than an easy chace? I have a desire to inculcate this pleasure upon thee, and to teach
thee to fly at nobler game than daws, crows, and widgeons: I have a mind to shew thee from
time to time, in the course of the correspondence thou hast so earnestly wished me to begin
on this illustrious occasion, that these exalted ladies may be abased, and to obviate one of
the objections that thou madest to me, when we were last together, that the pleasure which
attends these nobler aims, remunerates not the pains they bring with them; since, like a paltry
fellow as thou wert, thou assertedst that all women are alike.

Thou knowest nothing, Jack, of the delicacies of intrigue: nothing of the glory of outwitting
the witty and the watchful: of the joys that fill the mind of the inventive or contriving genius,
ruminating which to use of the different webs that offer to him for the entanglement of a haughty
charmer, who in her day has given him unnumbered torments. Thou, Jack, who, like a dog at his
ease, contentest thyself to growl over a bone thrown out to thee, dost not know the joys of
a chace, and in pursuing a winding game: these I will endeavour to rouse thee to, and then
thou wilt have reason doubly and trebly to thank me, as well because of thy present delight,
as with regard to thy prospect beyond the moon.

To this place I had written, purely to amuse myself, before I was admitted to my charmer. But
now I have to tell thee, that I was quite right in my conjecture, that she would set up for
herself, and dismiss me: for she has declared in so many words that such was her resolution:
And why? Because, to be plain with me, the more she saw of me, and of my ways, the less she
liked of either.

This cut me to the heart! I did not cry, indeed! Had I been a woman, I should though, and that
most plentifully: but I pulled out a white cambrick handkerchief: that I could command, but
not my tears.

She finds fault with my protestations, with my professions, with my vows: I cannot curse a
servant, the only privilege a master is known by, but I am supposed to be a trooper*--I must
not say, By my soul! nor, As I hope to be saved! Why, Jack, how particular this is! Would she
not have me think I have a precious soul, as well as she? If she thinks my salvation hopeless,
what a devil [another exceptionable word!] does she propose to reform me for? So I have not
an ardent expression left me.

     * See Letter VI. of this volume.

*****

What can be done with a woman who is above flattery, and despises all praise but that which
flows from the approbation of her own heart?

Well, Jack, thou seest it is high time to change my measures. I must run into the pious a little
faster than I had designed.

What a sad thing it would be, were I, after all, to lose her person, as well as her opinion!
the only time that further acquaintance, and no blow struck, nor suspicion given, ever lessened
me in a lady's favour! A cursed mortification!--'Tis certain I can have no pretence for holding
her, if she will go. No such thing as force to be used, or so much as hinted at: Lord send
us safe at London!--That's all I have for it now: and yet it must be the least part of my speech.

But why will this admirable creature urge her destiny? Why will she defy the power she is absolutely
dependent upon? Why will she still wish to my face that she had never left her father's house?
Why will she deny me her company, till she makes me lose my patience, and lay myself open to
her resentment? And why, when she is offended, does she carry her indignation to the utmost
length that a scornful beauty, in the very height of her power and pride, can go?

Is it prudent, thinkest thou, in her circumstances, to tell me, repeatedly to tell me, 'That
she is every hour more and more dissatisfied with herself and me? That I am not one who improve
upon her in my conversation and address?' [Couldst thou, Jack, bear this from a captive!] 'That
she shall not be easy while she is with me? That she knows better than to value herself upon
my volubility? That if I think she deserves the compliments I make her, I may pride myself
in those arts, by which I have made a fool of so extraordinary a person? That she shall never
forgive herself for meeting me, nor me for seducing her away?' [Her very words.] 'That her
regrets increase instead of diminish? That she will take care of herself; and, since her friends
thing it not worth while to pursue her, she will be left to her own care? That I shall make
Mrs. Sorlings's house more agreeable by my absence?--And go to Berks, to town, or wherever
I will,' [to the devil, I suppose,] 'with all her heart?'

The impolitic charmer!--To a temper so vindictive as she thins mine! To a free-liver, as she
believes me to be, who has her in his power! I was before, as thou knowest, balancing; now
this scale, now that, the heaviest. I only waited to see how her will would work, how mine
would lead me on. Thou seest what bias here takes--And wilt thou doubt that mine will be determined
by it? Were not her faults, before this, numerous enough? Why will she put me upon looking back?

I will sit down to argue with myself by-and-by, and thou shalt be acquainted with the result.

If thou didst but know, if thou hadst but beheld, what an abject slave she made me look like!--I
had given myself high airs, as she called them: but they were airs that shewed my love for
her: that shewed I could not live out of her company. But she took me down with a vengeance!
She made me look about me. So much advantage had she over me; such severe turns upon me; by
my soul, Jack, I had hardly a word to say for myself. I am ashamed to tell thee what a poor
creature she made me look like! But I could have told her something that would have humbled
her pretty pride at the instant, had she been in a proper place, and proper company about her.

To such a place then--and where she cannot fly me--And then to see how my will works, and what
can be done with the amorous see-saw; now humble, now proud; now expecting, or demanding; now
submitting, or acquiescing--till I have tried resistance.

But these hints are at present enough. I may further explain myself as I go along; and as I
confirm or recede in my future motions. If she will revive past disobligations! If she will--But
no more, no more, as I said, at present, of threatenings.

LETTER XVII

MR. LOVELACE, TO JOHN BELFORD, ESQ. And what if my forbearing to enter upon that subject come
out to be the true cause of their petulance and uneasiness!

I had once before played about the skirts of the irrevocable obligation; but thought myself
obliged to speak in clouds, and to run away from the subject, as soon as she took my meaning,
lest she should imagine it to be ungenerously urged, now she was in some sort in my power,
as she had forbid me beforehand, to touch upon it, till I were in a state of visible reformation,
and till a reconciliation with her friends were probable. But now, out-argued, out-talented,
and pushed so vehemently to leave one of whom I had no good pretence to hold, if she would
go; and who could so easily, if I had given her cause to doubt, have thrown herself into other
protection, or have returned to Harlowe-place and Solmes; I spoke out upon the subject, and
offered reasons, although with infinite doubt and hesitation, [lest she should be offended
at me, Belford!] why she should assent to the legal tie, and make me the happiest of men. And
O how the mantle cheek, the downcast eye, the silent yet trembling lip, and the heaving bosom,
a sweet collection of heightened beauties, gave evidence that the tender was not mortally offensive!

Charming creature! thought I, [but I charge thee, that thou let not any of the sex know my
exultation,*] Is it so soon come to this? Am I already lord of the destiny of a Clarissa Harlowe?
Am I already the reformed man thou resolvest I should be, before I had the least encouragement
given me? Is it thus, that the more thou knowest me, the less thou seest reason to approve
of me?--And can art and design enter into a breast so celestial? To banish me from thee, to
insist so rigorously upon my absence, in order to bring me closer to thee, and make the blessing
dear? Well do thy arts justify mine; and encourage me to let loose my plotting genius upon thee.

     * Mr. Lovelace might have spared this caution on this occasion, since
many of the sex [we mention it with regret] who on the first publication
had read thus far, and even to the lady's first escape, have been
readier to censure her for over-niceness, as we have observed in a
former note, page 42, than him for artifices and exultations not less
cruel and ungrateful, than ungenerous and unmanly.

But let me tell thee, charming maid, if thy wishes are at all to be answered, that thou hast
yet to account to me for thy reluctance to go off with me, at a crisis when thy going off was
necessary to avoid being forced into the nuptial fetters with a wretch, that, were he not thy
aversion, thou wert no more honest to thy own merit than to me.

I am accustomed to be preferred, let me tell thee, by thy equals in rank too, though thy inferiors
in merit: But who is not so? And shall I marry a woman, who has given me reason to doubt the
preference she has for me?

No, my dearest love, I have too sacred a regard for thy injunctions, to let them be broken
through, even by thyself. Nor will I take in thy full meaning by blushing silence only. Nor
shalt thou give me room to doubt, whether it be necessity or love, that inspires this condescending
impulse.

Upon these principles, what had I to do but to construe her silence into contemptuous displeasure?
And I begged her pardon for making a motion which I had so much reason to fear would offend
her: for the future I would pay a sacred regard to her previous injunctions, and prove to her
by all my conduct the truth of that observation, That true love is always fearful of offending.

And what could the lady say to this? methinks thou askest.

Say!--Why she looked vexed, disconcerted, teased; was at a loss, as I thought, whether to be
more angry with herself, or with me. She turned about, however, as if to hide a starting tear;
and drew a sigh into two or three but just audible quavers, trying to suppress it, and withdrew--leaving
me master of the field.

Tell me not of politeness; tell me not of generosity; tell me not of compassion--Is she not
a match for me? More than a match? Does she not outdo me at every fair weapon? Has she not
made me doubt her love? Has she not taken officious pains to declare that she was not averse
to Solmes for any respect she had to me? and her sorrow for putting herself out of his reach,
that is to say, for meeting me?

Then, what a triumph would it be to the Harlowe pride, were I now to marry this lady? A family
beneath my own! No one in it worthy of an alliance with but her! My own estate not contemptible!
Living within the bounds of it, to avoid dependence upon their betters, and obliged to no man
living! My expectations still so much more considerable! My person, my talents--not to be despised,
surely--yet rejected by them with scorn. Obliged to carry on an underhand address to their
daughter, when two of the most considerable families in the kingdom have made overtures, which
I have declined, partly for her sake, and partly because I never will marry; if she be not
the person. To be forced to steal her away, not only from them, but from herself! And must
I be brought to implore forgiveness and reconciliation from the Harlowes?--Beg to be acknowledged
as the son of a gloomy tyrant, whose only boast is his riches? As a brother to a wretch, who
has conceived immortal hatred to me; and to a sister who was beneath my attempts, or I would
have had her in my own way, and that with a tenth part of the trouble and pains that her sister
has cost me; and, finally, as a nephew to uncles, who value themselves upon their acquired
fortunes, would insult me as creeping to them on that account?--Forbid it in the blood of the
Lovelaces, that your last, and, let me say, not the meanest of your stock, should thus creep,
thus fawn, thus lick the dust, for a WIFE--!

Proceed anon.

LETTER XVIII

MR. LOVELACE, TO JOHN BELFORD, ESQ. [IN CONTINUATION.]

But is it not the divine CLARISSA [Harlowe let me not say; my soul spurns them all but her]
whom I am thus by application threatening?--If virtue be the true nobility, how is she ennobled,
and how shall an alliance with her ennoble, were not contempt due to the family from whom she
sprang and prefers to me!

But again, let me stop.--Is there not something wrong, has there not been something wrong,
in this divine creature? And will not the reflections upon that wrong (what though it may be
construed in my favour?*) make me unhappy, when novelty has lost its charms, and when, mind
and person, she is all my own? Libertines are nicer, if at all nice, than other men. They seldom
meet with the stand of virtue in the women whom they attempt. And, by the frailty of those
they have triumphed over, they judge of all the rest. 'Importunity and opportunity no woman
is proof against, especially from the persevering lover, who knows how to suit temptations
to inclinations:' This, thou knowest, is a prime article of the rake's creed.

     * The particular attention of such of the fair sex, as are more apt to
read for the same of amusement than instruction, is requested to this
letter of Mr. Lovelace.

And what! (methinks thou askest with surprise) Dost thou question this most admirable of women?--The
virtue of a CLARISSA dost thou question?

I do not, I dare not question it. My reverence for her will not let me directly question it.
But let me, in my turn, ask thee--Is not, may not her virtue be founded rather in pride than
in principle? Whose daughter is she?--And is she not a daughter? If impeccable, how came she
by her impeccability? The pride of setting an example to her sex has run away with her hitherto,
and may have made her till now invincible. But is not that pride abated? What may not both
men and women be brought to do in a mortified state? What mind is superior to calamity? Pride
is perhaps the principal bulwark of female virtue. Humble a woman, and may she not be effectually
humbled?

Then who says Miss Clarissa Harlowe is the paragon of virtue?--Is virtue itself?

All who know her, and have heard of her, it will be answered.

Common bruit!--Is virtue to be established by common bruit only?--Has her virtue ever been
proved?--Who has dared to try her virtue?

I told thee, I would sit down to argue with myself; and I have drawn myself into argumentation
before I was aware.

Let me enter into a strict discussion of this subject.

I know how ungenerous an appearance what I have said, and what I have further to say, on this
topic, will have from me: But am I not bringing virtue to the touchstone, with a view to exalt
it, if it come out to be proof?--'Avaunt then, for one moment, all consideration that may arise
from a weakness which some would miscall gratitude; and is oftentimes the corrupter of a heart
most ignoble!'

To the test then--and I will bring this charming creature to the strictest test, 'that all
the sex, who may be shewn any passages in my letters,' [and I know thou cheerest the hearts
of all thy acquaintance with such detached parts of mine as tend not to dishonour characters
or reveal names: and this gives me an appetite to oblige thee by interlardment,] 'that all
the sex, I say, may see what they ought to be; what is expected from them; and if they have
to deal with a person of reflection and punctilio, [of pride, if thou wilt,] how careful they
ought to be, by a regular and uniform conduct, not to give him cause to think lightly of them
for favours granted, which may be interpreted into natural weakness. For is not a wife the
keeper of a man's honour? And do not her faults bring more disgrace upon a husband than even
upon herself?'

It is not for nothing, Jack, that I have disliked the life of shackles.

To the test then, as I said, since now I have the question brought home to me, Whether I am
to have a wife? And whether she be to be a wife at the first or at the second hand?

I will proceed fairly. I do the dear creature not only strict but generous justice; for I will
try her by her own judgment, as well as by our principles.

She blames herself for having corresponded with me, a man of free character; and one indeed
whose first view it was to draw her into this correspondence; and who succeeded in it by means
unknown to herself.

'Now, what were her inducements to this correspondence?' If not what her niceness makes her
think blameworthy, why does she blame herself?

Has she been capable of error? Of persisting in that error?

Whoever was the tempter, that is not the thing; nor what the temptation. The fact, the error,
is now before us.

Did she persist in it against parental prohibition?

She owns she did.

Was a daughter ever known who had higher notions of the filial duty, of the parental authority?

Never.

'What must be the inducements, how strong, that were too strong for duty, in a daughter so
dutiful?--What must my thoughts have been of these inducements, what my hopes built upon them
at the time, taken in this light?'

Well, but it will be said, That her principal view was to prevent mischief between her brother
and her other friends, and the man vilely insulted by them all.

But why should she be more concerned for the safety of others than they were for their own?
And had not the rencounter then happened? 'Was a person of virtue to be prevailed upon to break
through her apparent, her acknowledged duty, upon any consideration?' And, if not, was she
to be so prevailed upon to prevent an apprehended evil only?

Thou, Lovelace, the tempter (thou wilt again break out and say) to be the accuser!

But I am not the accuser. I am the arguer only, and, in my heart, all the time acquit and worship
the divine creature. 'But let me, nevertheless, examine, whether the acquital be owing to her
merit, or to my weakness--Weakness the true name of love!'

But shall we suppose another motive?--And that is LOVE; a motive which all the world will excuse
her for. 'But let me tell all the world that do, not because they ought, but because all the
world is apt to be misled by it.'

Let LOVE then be the motive:--Love of whom?

A Lovelace, is the answer.

'Is there but one Lovelace in the world? May not more Lovelaces be attracted by so fine a figure?
By such exalted qualities? It was her character that drew me to her: and it was her beauty
and good sense that rivetted my chains: and now all together make me think her a subject worthy
of my attempts, worthy of my ambition.'

But has she had the candour, the openness, to acknowledge that love?

She has not.

'Well then, if love be at the bottom, is there not another fault lurking beneath the shadow
of that love?--Has she not affectation?--Or is it pride of heart?'

And what results?--'Is then the divine Clarissa capable of loving a man whom she ought not
to love? And is she capable of affectation? And is her virtue founded in pride?--And, if the
answer to these questions be affirmative, must she not then be a woman?'

And can she keep this love at bay? Can she make him, who has been accustomed to triumph over
other women, tremble? Can she conduct herself, as to make him, at times, question whether she
loves him or any man; 'yet not have the requisite command over the passion itself in steps
of the highest consequence to her honour, as she thinks,' [I am trying her, Jack, by her own
thoughts,] 'but suffer herself to be provoked to promise to abandon her father's house, and
go off with him, knowing his character; and even conditioning not to marry till improbably
and remote contingencies were to come to pass? What though the provocations were such as would
justify any other woman; yet was a CLARISSA to be susceptible to provocations which she thinks
herself highly censurable for being so much moved by?'

But let us see the dear creature resolved to revoke her promise, yet meeting her lover; a bold
and intrepid man, who was more than once before disappointed by her; and who comes, as she
knows, prepared to expect the fruits of her appointment, and resolved to carry her off. And
let us see him actually carrying her off, and having her at his mercy--'May there not be, I
repeat, other Lovelaces; other like intrepid, persevering enterprizers; although they may not
go to work in the same way?

'And has then a CLARISSA (herself her judge) failed?--In such great points failed?--And may
she not further fail?--Fail in the greatest point, to which all the other points, in which
she has failed, have but a natural tendency?'

Nor say thou, that virtue, in the eye of Heaven, is as much a manly as a womanly grace. By
virtue in this place I mean chastity, and to be superior to temptation; my Clarissa out of
the question. Nor ask thou, shall the man be guilty, yet expect the woman to be guiltless,
and even unsuspectible? Urge thou not these arguments, I say, since the wife, by a failure,
may do much more injury to the husband, than the husband can do to the wife, and not only to
her husband, but to all his family, by obtruding another man's children into his possessions,
perhaps to the exclusion of (at least to a participation with) his own; he believing them all
the time to be his. In the eye of Heaven, therefore, the sin cannot be equal. Besides I have
read in some places that the woman was made for the man, not the man for the woman. Virtue
then is less to be dispensed with in the woman than in the man.

Thou, Lovelace, (methinks some better man than thyself will say,) to expect such perfection
in a woman!

Yes, I, may I answer. Was not the great Caesar a great rake as to women? Was he not called,
by his very soldiers, on one of his triumphant entries into Rome, the bald-pated lecher? and
warning given of him to the wives, as well as to the daughter of his fellow-citizens? Yet did
not Caesar repudiate his wife for being only in company with Clodius, or rather because Clodius,
though by surprise upon her, was found in hers? And what was the reason he gave for it?--It
was this, (though a rake himself, as I have said,) and only this--The wife of Caesar must not
be suspected!--

Caesar was not a prouder man than Lovelace.

Go to then, Jack; nor say, nor let any body say, in thy hearing, that Lovelace, a man valuing
himself upon his ancestry, is singular in his expectations of a wife's purity, though not pure
himself.

As to my CLARISSA, I own that I hardly think there ever was such an angel of a woman. But has
she not, as above, already taken steps, which she herself condemns? Steps, which the world
and her own family did not think her capable of taking? And for which her own family will not
forgive her?

Nor think it strange, that I refuse to hear any thing pleaded in behalf of a standard virtue
from high provocations. 'Are not provocations and temptations the tests of virtue? A standard
virtue must not be allowed to be provoked to destroy or annihilate itself.

'May not then the success of him, who could carry her thus far, be allowed to be an encouragement
for him to try to carry her farther?' 'Tis but to try. Who will be afraid of a trail for this
divine creature? 'Thou knowest, that I have more than once, twice, or thrice, put to the fiery
trial young women of name and character; and never yet met with one who held out a month; nor
indeed so long as could puzzle my invention. I have concluded against the whole sex upon it.'
And now, if I have not found a virtue that cannot be corrupted, I will swear that there is
not one such in the whole sex. Is not then the whole sex concerned that this trial should be
made? And who is it that knows this lady, that would not stake upon her head the honour of
the whole?--Let her who would refuse it come forth, and desire to stand in her place.

I must assure thee, that I have a prodigious high opinion of virtue; as I have of all those
graces and excellencies which I have not been able to attain myself. Every free-liver would
not say this, nor think thus--every argument he uses, condemnatory of his own actions, as some
would think. But ingenuousness was ever a signal part of my character.

Satan, whom thou mayest, if thou wilt, in this case, call my instigator, put the good man of
old upon the severest trial. 'To his behaviour under these trials that good man owed his honour
and his future rewards.' An innocent person, if doubted, must wish to be brought to a fair
and candid trial.

Rinaldo, indeed, in Ariosto, put the Mantua Knight's cup of trial from him, which was to be
the proof of his wife's chastity*--This was his argument for forbearing the experiment: 'Why
should I seek a think I should be loth to find? My wife is a woman. The sex is frail. I cannot
believe better of her than I do. It will be to my own loss, if I find reason to think worse.'
But Rinaldo would not have refused the trial of the lady, before she became his wife, and when
he might have found his account in detecting her.

     * The story tells us, that whoever drank of this cup, if his wife were
chaste, could drink without spilling; if otherwise, the contrary.

For my part, I would not have put the cup from me, though married, had it been but in hope
of finding reason to confirm my good opinion of my wife's honour; and that I might know whether
I had a snake or a dove in my bosom.

To my point--'What must that virtue be which will not stand a trial?--What that woman who would
wish to shun it?'

Well, then, a trial seems necessary for the furthest establishment of the honour of so excellent
a creature.

And who shall put her to this trial? Who, but the man who has, as she thinks, already induced
her in lesser points to swerve?--And this for her own sake in a double sense--not only, as
he has been able to make some impression, but as she regrets the impression made; and so may
be presumed to be guarded against his further attempts.

The situation she is at present in, it must be confessed is a disadvantageous one to her: but,
if she overcome, that will redound to her honour.

Shun not, therefore, my dear soul, further trials, nor hate me for making them.--'For what
woman can be said to be virtuous till she has been tried?

'Nor is one effort, one trial, to be sufficient. Why? Because a woman's heart may at one time
be adamant, at another wax'--as I have often experienced. And so, no doubt, hast thou.

A fine time of it, methinks, thou sayest, would the woman have, if they were all to be tried--!

But, Jack, I am not for that neither. Though I am a rake, I am not a rake's friend; except
thine and company's.

And be this one of the morals of my tedious discussion--'Let the little rogues who would not
be put to the question, as I may call it, choose accordingly. Let them prefer to their favour
good honest sober fellows, who have not been used to play dog's tricks: who will be willing
to take them as they offer; and, who being tolerable themselves, are not suspicious of others.'

But what, methinks thou askest, is to become of the lady if she fail?

What?--Why will she not, 'if once subdued, be always subdued?' Another of our libertine maxims.
And what an immense pleasure to a marriage-hater, what rapture to thought, to be able to prevail
upon such a woman as Miss Clarissa Harlowe to live with him, without real change of name!

But if she resist--if nobly she stand her trial?--

Why then I will marry her; and bless my starts for such an angel of a wife.

But will she not hate thee?--will she not refuse--

No, no, Jack!--Circumstanced and situated as we are, I am not afraid of that. And hate me!
Why should she hate the man who loves her upon proof?

And then for a little hint at reprisal--am I not justified in my resolutions of trying her
virtue, who is resolved, as I may say, to try mine? Who has declared that she will not marry
me, till she has hopes of my reformation?

And now, to put an end to this sober argumentation, Wilt thou not thyself (whom I have supposed
an advocate for the lady, because I know that Lord M. has put thee upon using the interest
he thinks thou hast in me, to persuade me to enter the pale; wilt thou not thyself) allow me
to try if I cannot awaken the woman in her?--To try if she, with all that glowing symmetry
of parts, and that full bloom of vernal graces, by which she attracts every eye, be really
inflexible as to the grand article?

Let me begin then, as opportunity presents--I will; and watch her every step to find one sliding
one; her every moment to find the moment critical. And the rather, as she spares me not, but
takes every advantage that offers to puzzle and plague me; nor expect nor thinks me to be a
good man.

If she be a woman, and love me, I shall surely catch her once tripping: for love was ever a
traitor to its harbourer: and love within, and I without, she will be more than woman, as the
poet says, or I less than man, if I succeed not.

Now, Belford, all is out. The lady is mine; shall be more mine. Marriage, I see, is in my power,
now she is so. Else perhaps it had not. If I can have her without marriage, who can blame me
for trying? If not, great will be her glory, and my future confidence. And well will she merit
the sacrifice I shall make her of my liberty; and from all her sex honours next to divine,
for giving a proof, 'that there was once a woman whose virtue no trials, no stratagems, no
temptations, even from the man she hated not, could overpower.'

Now wilt thou see all my circulation: as in a glass wilt thou see it.--CABALA, however, is
the word;* nor let the secret escape thee even in thy dreams.

     * This word, whenever used by any of these gentlemen, was agreed to imply
an inviolable secret.

Nobody doubts that she is to be my wife. Let her pass for such when I give the word. 'Mean
time reformation shall be my stalking-horse; some one of the women in London, if I can get
her hither, my bird.' And so much for this time.

LETTER XIX

MISS HOWE, TO MISS CLARISSA HARLOWE [IN ANSWER TO LETTERS IX. XV.]

Do not be so much concerned, my dearest friend, at the bickerings between my mother and me.
We love one another dearly notwithstanding. If my mother had not me to find fault with, she
must find fault with somebody else. And as to me, I am a very saucy girl; and were not this
occasion, there would be some other, to shew it.

You have heard me say, that this was always the case between us. You could not otherwise have
known it. For when you was with us, you harmonized us both; and, indeed, I was always more
afraid of you than of my mother. But then that awe is accompanied with love. Your reproofs,
as I have always found, are so charmingly mild and instructive; so evidently calculated to
improve, and not to provoke; that a generous temper must be amended by them. But hear now,
mind my good mamma, when you are not with us--You shall, I tell you, Nancy. I will have it
so. Don't I know best, I won't be disobeyed. How can a daughter of spirits bear such language;
such looks too with the language; and not have a longing mind to disobey?

Don't advise me, my dear, to subscribe to my mother's prohibition of correspondence with you.
She has no reason for it. Nor would she of her own judgment have prohibited it. That odd old
ambling soul your uncle, (whose visits are frequenter than ever,) instigated by your malicious
and selfish brother and sister in the occasion. And they have only borrowed my mother's lips,
at the distance they are from you, for a sort of speaking trumpet for them. The prohibition,
once more I say, cannot come from her heart: But if it did, is so much danger to be apprehended
from my continuing to write to one of my own sex, as if I wrote to one of the other? Don't
let dejection and disappointment, and the course of oppression which you have run through,
weaken your mind, my dearest creature, and make you see inconveniencies where there possibly
cannot be any. If your talent is scribbling, as you call it; so is mine--and I will scribble
on, at all opportunities; and to you; let them say what they will. Nor let your letters be
filled with the self-accusations you mention: there is no cause for them. I wish that your
Anna Howe, who continues in her mother's house, were but half so good as Miss Clarissa Harlowe,
who has been driven out of her father's.

I will say nothing upon your letter to your sister till I see the effect it will have. You
hope, you tell me, that you shall have your money and clothes sent you, notwithstanding my
opinion to the contrary--I am sorry to have it to acquaint you, that I have just now heard,
that they have sat in council upon your letter; and that your mother was the only person who
was for sending you your things, and was overruled. I charge you therefore to accept of my
offer, as by my last: and give me particular directions for what you want, that I can supply
you with besides.

Don't set your thought so much upon a reconciliation as to prevent your laying hold of any
handsome opportunity to give yourself a protector; such a one as the man will be, who, I imagine,
husband-like, will let nobody insult you but himself.

What could he mean by letting slip such a one as that you mention? I don't know how to blame
you; for how you go beyond silence and blushes, when the foolish fellow came with his observances
of the restrictions which you laid him under when in another situation? But, as I told you
above, you really strike people into awe. And, upon my word, you did not spare him.

I repeat what I said in my last, that you have a very nice part to act: and I will add, that
you have a mind that is much too delicate for your part. But when the lover is exalted, the
lady must be humbled. He is naturally proud and saucy. I doubt you must engage his pride, which
he calls his honour: and that you must throw off a little more of the veil. And I would have
you restrain your wishes before him, that you had not met him, and the like. What signifies
wishing, my dear? He will not bear it. You can hardly expect that he will.

Nevertheless, it vexed me to the very bottom of my pride, that any wretch of that sex should
be able to triumph over Clarissa.

I cannot, however, but say, that I am charmed with your spirit. So much sweetness, where sweetness
is requisite; so much spirit, where spirit is called for--what a true magnanimity!

But I doubt, in your present circumstances, you must endeavour after a little more of the reserve,
in cases where you are displeased with him, and palliate a little. That humility which he puts
on when you rise upon him, is not natural to him.

Methinks I see the man hesitating, and looking like the fool you paint him, under your corrective
superiority!--But he is not a fool. Don't put him upon mingling resentment with his love.

You are very serious, my dear, in the first of the two letters before me, in relation to Mr.
Hickman and me; and in relation to my mother and me. But as to the latter, you must not be
too grave. If we are not well together at one time, we are not ill together at another. And
while I am able to make her smile in the midst of the most angry fit she ever fell into on
the present occasion, (though sometimes she would not if she could help it,) it is a very good
sign; a sign that displeasure can never go deep, or be lasting. And then a kind word, or kind
look, to her favourite Hickman, sets the one into raptures, and the other in tolerable humour,
at any time.

But your case pains me at heart; and with all my levity, both the good folks most sometimes
partake of that pain; nor will it be over, as long as you are in a state of uncertainty; and
especially as I was not able to prevail for that protection for you which would have prevented
the unhappy step, the necessity for which we both, with so much reason, deplore.

I have only to add (and yet it is needless to tell you) that I am, and will ever be,

Your affectionate friend and servant, ANNA HOWE.

LETTER XX

MISS CLARISSA HARLOWE, TO MISS HOWE

You tell me, my dear, that my clothes and the little sum of money I left behind me, will not
be sent me.--But I will still hope. It is yet early days. When their passions subside, they
will better consider of the matter; and especially as I have my ever dear and excellent mother
for my friend in this request! O the sweet indulgence! How has my heart bled, and how does
it still bleed for her!

You advise me not to depend upon a reconciliation. I do not, I cannot depend upon it. But nevertheless,
it is the wish next my heart. And as to this man, what can I do? You see, that marriage is
not absolutely in my own power, if I were inclined to prefer it to the trial which I think
I ought to have principally in view to make for a reconciliation.

You say, he is proud and insolent--indeed he is. But can it be your opinion, that he intends
to humble me down to the level of his mean pride?

And what mean you, my dear friend, when you say, that I must throw off a little more of the
veil?--Indeed I never knew that I wore one. Let me assure you, that if I never see any thing
in Mr. Lovelace that looks like a design to humble me, his insolence shall never make me discover
a weakness unworthy of a person distinguished by your friendship; that is to say, unworthy
either of my sex, or of my former self.

But I hope, as I am out of all other protection, that he is not capable of mean or low resentments.
If he has had any extraordinary trouble on my account, may he not thank himself for it? He
may; and lay it, if he pleases, to his character; which, as I have told him, gave at least
a pretence to my brother against him. And then, did I ever make him any promises? Did I ever
profess a love for him? Did I ever wish for the continuance of his address? Had not my brother's
violence precipitated matters, would not my indifference to him in all likelihood (as I designed
it should) have tired out his proud spirit,* and make him set out for London, where he used
chiefly to reside? And if he had, would not there have been an end of all his pretensions and
hopes? For no encouragement had I given him; nor did I then correspond with him. Nor, believe
me, should I have begun to do so--the fatal rencounter not having then happened; which drew
me in afterwards for others' sakes (fool that I was!) and not for my own. And can you think,
or can he, that even this but temporarily-intended correspondence (which, by the way, my mother*
connived at) would have ended thus, had I not been driven on one hand, and teased on the other,
to continue it, the occasion which had at first induced it continuing? What pretence then has
he, were I to be absolutely in his power, to avenge himself on me for the faults of others,
and through which I have suffered more than he? It cannot, cannot be, that I should have cause
to apprehend him to be so ungenerous, so bad a man.

     * See Vol.I. Letter IV.

You bid me not to be concerned at the bickerings between your mother and you. Can I avoid concern,
when those bickerings are on my account? That they are raised (instigated shall I say?) by
my uncle, and my other relations, surely must add to my concern.

But I must observe, perhaps too critically for the state my mind is in at present, that the
very sentences you give from your mother, as in so many imperatives, which you take amiss,
are very severe reflections upon yourself. For instance--You shall, I tell you, Nancy, implies
that you had disputed her will--and so of the rest.

And further let me observe, with respect to what you say, that there cannot be the same reason
for a prohibition of correspondence with me, as there was of mine with Mr. Lovelace; that I
thought as little of bad consequences from my correspondence with him at the time, as you can
do from yours with me now. But, if obedience be a duty, the breach of it is a fault, however
circumstances may differ. Surely there is no merit in setting up our own judgment against the
judgments of our parents. And if it is punishable so to do, I have been severely punished;
and that is what I warned you of from my own dear experience.

Yet, God forgive me! I advise thus against myself with very great reluctance: and, to say truth,
have not strength of mind, at present, to decline it myself. But, if my occasion go not off,
I will take it into further consideration.

You give me very good advice in relation to this man; and I thank you for it. When you bid
me be more upon the reserve with him in expressing my displeasure, perhaps I may try for it:
but to palliate, as you call it, that, my dearest Miss Howe, cannot be done, by

Your own, CLARISSA HARLOWE.

LETTER XXI

MISS CLARISSA HARLOWE, TO MISS HOWE

You may believe, my dear Miss Howe, that the circumstances of the noise and outcry within the
garden-door, on Monday last, gave me no small uneasiness, to think that I was in the hands
of a man, who could, by such vile premeditation, lay a snare to trick me out of myself, as
I have so frequently called it.

Whenever he came in my sight, the thought of this gave me an indignation that made his presence
disgustful to me; and the more, as I fancied I beheld in his face a triumph which reproached
my weakness on that account; although perhaps it was only the same vivacity and placidness
that generally sit upon his features.

I was resolved to task him upon this subject, the first time I could have patience to enter
upon it with him. For, besides that it piqued me excessively from the nature of the artifice,
I expected shuffling and evasion, if he were guilty, that would have incensed me: and, if not
confessedly guilty, such unsatisfactory declarations as still would have kept my mind doubtful
and uneasy; and would, upon every new offence that he might give me, sharpen my disgust to me.

I have had the opportunity I waited for; and will lay before you the result.

He was making his court to my good opinion in very polite terms, and with great seriousness
lamenting that he had lost it; declaring, that he knew not how he had deserved to do so; attributing
to me an indifference to him, that seemed, to his infinite concern, hourly to increase, And
he besought me to let him know my whole mind, that he might have an opportunity either to confess
his faults and amend them, or clear his conduct to my satisfaction, and thereby entitle himself
to a greater share of my confidence.

I answered him with quickness--Then, Mr. Lovelace, I will tell you one thing with a frankness,
that is, perhaps, more suitable to my character than to yours, [He hoped not, he said,] which
gives me a very bad opinion of you, as a designing, artful man.

I am all attention, Madam.

I never can think tolerably of you, while the noise and voice I heard at the garden-door, which
put me into the terror you took so much advantage of, remains unaccounted for. Tell me fairly,
tell me candidly, the whole of that circumstance; and of your dealings with that wicked Joseph
Leman; and, according to your explicitness in this particular, I shall form a judgment of your
future professions.

I will, without reserve, my dearest life, said he, tell you the whole; and hope that my sincerity
in the relation will atone for any thing you may think wrong in the fact.

'I knew nothing, said he, of this man, this Leman, and should have scorned a resort to so low
a method as bribing the servant of any family to let me into the secrets of that family, if
I had not detected him in attempting to corrupt a servant of mine, to inform him of all my
motions, of all my supposed intrigues, and, in short, of every action of my private life, as
well as of my circumstances and engagements; and this for motives too obvious to be dwelt upon.

'My servant told me of his offers, and I ordered him, unknown to the fellow, to let me hear
a conversation that was to pass between them.

'In the midst of it, and just as he had made an offer of money for a particular piece of intelligence,
promising more when procured, I broke in upon them, and by bluster, calling for a knife to
cut off his ears (one of which I took hold of) in order to make a present of it, as I said,
to his employers, I obliged him to tell me who they were.

'Your brother, Madam, and your uncle Antony, he named.

'It was not difficult, when I had given him my pardon on naming them, (after I had set before
him the enormity of the task he had undertaken, and the honourableness of my intentions to
your dear self,) to prevail upon him, by a larger reward, to serve me; since, at the same time,
he might preserve the favour of your uncle and brother, as I desired to know nothing but what
related to myself and to you, in order to guard us both against the effects of an ill-will,
which all his fellow-servants, as well as himself, as he acknowledged, thought undeserved.

'By this means, I own to you, Madam, I frequently turned his principals about upon a pivot
of my own, unknown to themselves: and the fellow, who is always calling himself a plain man,
and boasting of his conscience, was the easier, as I condescended frequently to assure him
of my honourable views; and as he knew that the use I made of his intelligence, in all likelihood,
prevented fatal mischiefs.

'I was the more pleased with his services, as (let me acknowledge to you, Madam) they procured
to you, unknown to yourself, a safe and uninterrupted egress (which perhaps would not otherwise
have been continued to you so long as it was) to the garden and wood-house: for he undertook,
to them, to watch all your motions: and the more cheerfully, (for the fellow loves you,) as
it kept off the curiosity of others.'*

     * See Vol.II. Letter XXXVI.

So, my dear, it comes out, that I myself was obliged to this deep contriver.

I sat in silent astonishment; and thus he went on.

'As to the circumstance, for which you think so hardly of me, I do freely confess, that having
a suspicion that you would revoke your intention of getting away, and in that case apprehending
that we should not have the time together that was necessary for that purpose; I had ordered
him to keep off every body he could keep off, and to be himself within a view of the garden-door;
for I was determined, if possible, to induce you to adhere to your resolution.'--

But pray, Sir, interrupting him, how came you to apprehend that I should revoke my intention?
I had indeed deposited a letter to that purpose; but you had it not: and how, as I had reserved
to myself the privilege of a revocation, did you know, but I might have prevailed upon my friends,
and so have revoked upon good grounds?

'I will be very ingenuous, Madam--You had made me hope that if you changed your mind, you would
give me a meeting to apprize me of the reasons for it. I went to the loose bricks, and I saw
the letter there: and as I knew your friends were immovably fixed in their schemes, I doubted
not but the letter was to revoke or suspend your resolution; and probably to serve instead
of a meeting too. I therefore let it lie, that if you did revoke, you might be under the necessity
of meeting me for the sake of the expectation you had given me: and as I came prepared, I was
resolved, pardon me, Madam, whatever were your intentions, that you should not go back. Had
I taken your letter I must have been determined by the contents of it, for the present at least:
but not having received it, and you having reason to think I wanted not resolution in a situation
so desperate, to make your friends a personal visit, I depended upon the interview you had
bid me hope for.'

Wicked wretch, said I; it is my grief, that I gave you opportunity to take so exact a measure
of my weakness!--But would you have presumed to visit the family, had I not met you?

Indeed I would. I had some friends in readiness, who were to have accompanied me to them. And
had your father refused to give me audience, I would have taken my friends with me to Solmes.

And what did you intend to do to Mr. Solmes?

Not the least hurt, had the man been passive.

But had he not been passive, as you call it, what would you have done to Mr. Solmes?

He was loth, he said to tell me--yet not the least hurt to his person.

I repeated my question.

If he must tell me, he only proposed to carry off the poor fellow, and to hide him for a month
or two. And this he would have done, let what would have been the consequence.

Was ever such a wretch heard of!--I sighed from the bottom of my heart; but bid him proceed
from the part I had interrupted him at.

'I ordered the fellow, as I told you, Madam, said he, to keep within view of the garden-door:
and if he found any parley between us, and any body coming (before you could retreat undiscovered)
whose coming might be attended with violent effects, he should cry out; and this not only in
order to save himself from their suspicions of him, but to give me warning to make off, and,
if possible, to induce you (I own it, Madam) to go off with me, according to your own appointment.
And I hope all circumstances considered, and the danger I was in of losing you for ever, that
the acknowledgement of that contrivance, or if you had not met me, that upon Solmes, will not
procure me your hatred: for, had they come as I expected as well as you, what a despicable
wretch had I been, could I have left you to the insults of a brother and other of your family,
whose mercy was cruelty when they had not the pretence with which this detected interview would
have furnished them!'

What a wretch! said I.--But if, Sir, taking your own account of this strange matter to be fact,
any body were coming, how happened it, that I saw only that man Leman (I thought it was he)
out at the door, and at a distance, look after us?

Very lucky! said he, putting his hand first in one pocket, then in another--I hope I have not
thrown it away--it is, perhaps, in the coat I had on yesterday--little did I think it would
be necessary to be produced--but I love to come to a demonstration whenever I can--I may be
giddy--I may be heedless. I am indeed--but no man, as to you, Madam, ever had a sincerer heart.

He then stepping to the parlour-door, called his servant to bring him the coat he had on yesterday.

The servant did. And in the pocket, rumpled up as a paper he regarded not, he pulled out a
letter, written by that Joseph, dated Monday night; in which 'he begs pardon for crying out
so soon--says, That his fears of being discovered to act on both sides, had made him take the
rushing of a little dog (that always follows him) through the phyllirea-hedge, for Betty's
being at hand, or some of his masters: and that when he found his mistake, he opened the door
by his own key (which the contriving wretch confessed he had furnished him with) and inconsiderately
ran out in a hurry, to have apprized him that his crying out was owing to his fright only:'
and he added, 'that they were upon the hunt for me, by the time he returned.*

     * See his Letter to Joseph Leman, Vol.III. No.III. towards the end, where
he tells him, he would contrive for him a letter of this nature to copy.

I shook my head--Deep! deep! deep! said I, at the best!--O Mr. Lovelace! God forgive and reform
you!--But you are, I see plainly, (upon the whole of your own account,) a very artful, a very
designing man.

Love, my dearest life, is ingenious. Night and day have I racked my stupid brain [O Sir, thought
I, not stupid! 'Twere well perhaps if it were] to contrive methods to prevent the sacrifice
designed to be made of you, and the mischief that must have ensued upon it: so little hold
in your affections: such undeserved antipathy from your friends: so much danger of losing you
for ever from both causes. I have not had for the whole fortnight before last Monday, half
an hour's rest at a time. And I own to you, Madam, that I should never have forgiven myself,
had I omitted any contrivance or forethought that would have prevented your return without me.

Again I blamed myself for meeting him: and justly; for there were many chances to one, that
I had not met him. And if I had not, all his fortnight's contrivances, as to me, would have
come to nothing; and, perhaps, I might nevertheless have escaped Solmes.

Yet, had he resolved to come to Harlowe-place with his friends, and been insulted, as he certainly
would have been, what mischiefs might have followed!

But his resolutions to run away with and to hide the poor Solmes for a month or so, O my dear!
what a wretch have I let run away with me, instead of Solmes!

I asked him, if he thought such enormities as these, such defiances of the laws of society,
would have passed unpunished?

He had the assurance to say, with one of his usual gay airs, That he should by this means have
disappointed his enemies, and saved me from a forced marriage. He had no pleasure in such desperate
pushes. Solmes he would not have personally hurt. He must have fled his country, for a time
at least: and, truly, if he had been obliged to do so, (as all his hopes of my favour must
have been at an end,) he would have had a fellow-traveller of his own sex out of our family,
whom I little thought of.

Was ever such a wretch!--To be sure he meant my brother!

And such, Sir, said I, in high resentment, are the uses you make of your corrupt intelligencer--

My corrupt intelligencer, Madam! interrupted me, He is to this hour your brother's as well
as mine. By what I have ingenuously told you, you may see who began this corruption. Let me
assure you, Madam, that there are many free things which I have been guilty of as reprisals,
in which I would not have been the aggressor.

All that I shall further say on this head, Mr. Lovelace, is this: that as this vile double-faced
wretch has probably been the cause of great mischief on both sides, and still continues, as
you own, his wicked practices, I think it would be but just, to have my friends apprized what
a creature he is whom some of them encourage.

What you please, Madam, as to that--my service, as well as your brother's is now almost over
for him. The fellow has made a good hand of it. He does not intend to stay long in his place.
He is now actually in treaty for an inn, which will do his business for life. I can tell you
further, that he makes love to your sister's Betty: and that by my advice. They will be married
when he is established. An innkeeper's wife is every man's mistress; and I have a scheme in
my head to set some engines at work to make her repent her saucy behaviour to you to the last
day of her life.

What a wicked schemer you are, Sir!--Who shall avenge upon you the still greater evils which
you have been guilty of? I forgive Betty with all my heart. She was not my servant; and but
too probably, in what she did, obeyed the commands of her to whom she owed duty, better than
I obeyed those to whom I owed more.

No matter for that, the wretch said [To be sure, my dear, he must design to make me afraid
of him]: The decree was gone out--Betty must smart--smart too by an act of her own choice.
He loved, he said, to make bad people their own punishers.--Nay, Madam, excuse me; but if the
fellow, if this Joseph, in your opinion, deserves punishment, mine is a complicated; a man
and his wife cannot well suffer separately, and it may come home to him too.

I had no patience with him. I told him so. I see, Sir, said I, I see, what a man I am with.
Your rattle warns me of the snake.--And away I flung: leaving him seemingly vexed, and in confusion.

LETTER XXII

MISS CLARISSA HARLOWE, TO MISS HOWE

My plain-dealing with Mr. Lovelace, on seeing him again, and the free dislike I expressed to
his ways, his manners, and his contrivances, as well as to his speeches, have obliged him to
recollect himself a little. He will have it, that the menaces which he threw out just now against
my brother and Mr. Solmes, are only the effect of an unmeaning pleasantry. He has too great
a stake in his country, he says, to be guilty of such enterprises as should lay him under a
necessity of quitting it for ever. Twenty things, particularly, he says, he has suffered Joseph
Leman to tell him of, that were not, and could not be true, in order to make himself formidable
in some people's eyes, and this purely with a view to prevent mischief. He is unhappy, as far
as he knows, in a quick invention; in hitting readily upon expedients; and many things are
reported of him which he never said, and many which he never did, and others which he has only
talked of, (as just now,) and which he has forgot as soon as the words have passed his lips.

This may be so, in part, my dear. No one man so young could be so wicked as he has been reported
to be. But such a man at the head of such wretches as he is said to have at his beck, all men
of fortune and fearlessness, and capable of such enterprises as I have unhappily found him
capable of, what is not to be apprehended from him!

His carelessness about his character is one of his excuses: a very bad one. What hope can a
woman have of a man who values not his own reputation?--These gay wretches may, in mixed conversation,
divert for an hour, or so: but the man of probity, the man of virtue, is the man that is to
be the partner for life. What woman, who could help it, would submit it to the courtesy of
a wretch, who avows a disregard to all moral sanctions, whether he will perform his part of
the matrimonial obligation, and treat her with tolerable politeness?

With these notions, and with these reflections, to be thrown upon such a man myself!--Would
to Heaven--But what avail wishes now?--To whom can I fly, if I would fly from him?

LETTER XXIII

MR. LOVELACE, TO JOHN BELFORD, ESQ. FRIDAY, APRIL 14.

Never did I hear of such a parcel of foolish toads as these Harlowes!--Why, Belford, the lady
must fall, if every hair of her head were a guardian angel, unless they were to make a visible
appearance for her, or, snatching her from me at unawares, would draw her after them into the
starry regions.

All I had to apprehend, was, that a daughter, so reluctantly carried off, would offer terms
to her father, and would be accepted upon a mutual concedence; they to give up Solmes; she
to give up me. And so I was contriving to do all I could to guard against the latter. But they
seem resolved to perfect the work they have begun.

What stupid creatures are there in the world! This foolish brother not to know, that he who
would be bribed to undertake a base thing by one, would be over-bribed to retort the baseness;
especially when he could be put into the way to serve himself by both!--Thou, Jack, wilt never
know one half of my contrivances.

   He here relates the conversation between him and the Lady (upon the
   subject of the noise and exclamations his agent made at the garden-
   door) to the same effect as in the Lady's Letter, No. XXI. and
   proceeds exulting:

What a capacity for glorious mischief has thy friend!--Yet how near the truth all of it! The
only derivation, my asserting that the fellow made the noises by mistake, and through fright,
and not by previous direction: had she known the precise truth, her anger, to be so taken in,
would never have let her forgive me.

Had I been a military hero, I should have made gunpowder useless; for I should have blown up
all my adversaries by dint of stratagem, turning their own devices upon them.

But these fathers and mothers--Lord help 'em!--Were not the powers of nature stronger than
those of discretion, and were not that busy dea bona to afford her genial aids, till tardy
prudence qualified parents to manage their future offspring, how few people would have children!

James and Arabella may have their motives; but what can be said for a father acting as this
father has acted? What for a mother? What for an aunt? What for uncles?--Who can have patience
with such fellows and fellowesses?

Soon will the fair one hear how high their foolish resentments run against her: and then will
she, it is to be hoped, have a little more confidence in me. Then will I be jealous that she
loves me not with the preference my heart builds upon: then will I bring her to confessions
of grateful love: and then will I kiss her when I please; and not stand trembling, as now,
like a hungry hound, who sees a delicious morsel within his reach, (the froth hanging upon
his vermilion jaws,) yet dares not leap at it for his life.

But I was originally a bashful mortal. Indeed I am bashful still with regard to this lady--Bashful,
yet know the sex so well!--But that indeed is the reason that I know it so well:--For, Jack,
I have had abundant cause, when I have looked into myself, by way of comparison with the other
sex, to conclude that a bashful man has a good deal of the soul of a woman; and so, like Tiresias,
can tell what they think, and what they drive at, as well as themselves.

The modest ones and I, particularly, are pretty much upon a par. The difference between us
is only, what they think, I act. But the immodest ones out-do the worst of us by a bar's length,
both in thinking and acting.

One argument let me plead in proof of my assertion; That even we rakes love modesty in a woman;
while the modest woman, as they are accounted, (that is to say, the slyest,) love, and generally
prefer, an impudent man. Whence can this be, but from a likeness in nature? And this made the
poet say, That ever woman is a rake in her heart. It concerns them, by their actions, to prove
the contrary, if they can.

Thus have I read in some of the philosophers, That no wickedness is comparable to the wickedness
of a woman.* Canst thou tell me, Jack, who says this? Was it Socrates? for he had the devil
of a wife--Or who? Or is it Solomon?--King Solomon--Thou remembrest to have read of such a
king, dost thou not? SOL-O-MON, I learned, in my infant state [my mother was a good woman]
to answer, when asked, Who was the wisest man?--But my indulgent questioner never asked me
how he came by the uninspired part of his wisdom.

     * Mr. Lovelace is as much out in his conjecture of Solomon, as of
Socrates. The passage is in Ecclesiasticus, chap. xxv.

Come, come, Jack, you and I are not so very bad, could we but stop where we are.

   He then gives the particulars of what passed between him and the Lady on
   his menaces relating to her brother and Mr. Solmes, and of his design
   to punish Betty Barnes and Joseph Leman.

I will now give you the particulars of a conversation that has just passed between Mr. Lovelace
and me, which I must call agreeable.

It began with his telling me, that he had just received intelligence that my friends were on
a sudden come to a resolution to lay aside all thoughts of pursuing me, or of getting me back:
and that therefore he attended me to know of my pleasure; and what I would do, or have him do?

I told him, that I would have him leave me directly; and that, when it was known to every body
that I was absolutely independent of him, it would pass, that I had left my father's house
because of my brother's ill usage of me: which was a plea that I might make with justice, and
to the excuse of my father, as well as of myself.

He mildly replied, that if we could be certain that my relations would adhere to this their
new resolution, he could have no objection, since such was my pleasure; but, as he was well
assured that they had taken it only from apprehensions, that a more active one might involve
my brother (who had breathed nothing but revenge) in some fatal misfortune, there was too much
reason to believe that they would resume their former purpose the moment they should think
they safely might.

This, Madam, said he, is a risque I cannot run. You would think it strange if I could. And
yet, as soon as I knew they had so given out, I thought it proper to apprize you of it, and
take your commands upon it.

Let me hear, said I, (willing to try if he had any particular view,) what you think most advisable?

'Tis very easy to say that, if I durst--if I might not offend you--if it were not to break
conditions that shall be inviolable with me.

Say then, Sir, what you would say. I can approve or disapprove, as I think fit.

Had not the man a fine opportunity here to speak out?--He had. And thus he used it.

To wave, Madam, what I would say till I have more courage to speak out [More courage,--Mr.
Lovelace more courage, my dear!]--I will only propose what I think will be most agreeable to
you--suppose, if you choose not to go to Lady Betty's, that you take a turn cross the country
to Windsor?

Why to Windsor?

Because it is a pleasant place: because it lies in the way either to Berkshire, to Oxford,
or to London: Berkshire, where Lord M. is at present: Oxford, in the neighbourhood of which
lives Lady Betty: London, whither you may retire at your pleasure: or, if you will have it
so, whither I may go, you staying at Windsor; and yet be within an easy distance of you, if
any thing should happen, or if your friends should change their new-taken resolution.

This proposal, however, displeased me not. But I said, my only objection was, the distance
of Windsor from Miss Howe, of whom I should be glad to be always within two or three hours
reach of by messenger, if possible.

If I had thoughts of any other place than Windsor, or nearer to Miss Howe, he wanted but my
commands, and would seek for proper accommodations: but, fix as I pleased, farther or nearer,
he had servants, and they had nothing else to do but to obey me.

A grateful thing then he named to me--To send for my Hannah, as soon as I shall be fixed;*
unless I would choose one of the young gentlewomen here to attend me; both of whom, as I had
acknowledged, were very obliging; and he knew I had generosity enough to make it worth their while.

     * See his reasons for proposing Windsor, Letter XXV.--and her Hannah,
Letter XXVI.

This of Hannah, he might see, I took very well. I said I had thoughts of sending for her, as
soon as I got to more convenient lodgings. As to these young gentlewomen, it were pity to break
in upon that usefulness which the whole family were of to each other; each having her proper
part, and performing it with an agreeable alacrity: insomuch, that I liked them all so well,
that I could even pass my days among them, were he to leave me; by which means the lodgings
would be more convenient to me than now they were.

He need not repeat his objections to this place, he said: but as to going to Windsor, or wherever
else I thought fit, or as to his personal attendance, or leaving me, he would assure me (he
very agreeably said) that I could propose nothing in which I thought my reputation, and even
my punctilio, concerned, that he would not cheerfully come into. And since I was so much taken
up with my pen, he would instantly order his horse to be got ready, and would set out.

Not to be off my caution. Have you any acquaintance at Windsor? said I.--Know you of any convenient
lodgings there?

Except the forest, replied he, where I have often hunted, I know the least of Windsor of any
place so noted and so pleasant. Indeed I have not a single acquaintance there.

Upon the whole, I told him, that I thought his proposal of Windsor, not amiss; and that I would
remove thither, if I could get a lodging only for myself, and an upper chamber for Hannah;
for that my stock of money was but small, as was easy to be conceived and I should be very
loth to be obliged to any body. I added, that the sooner I removed the better; for that then
he could have no objection to go to London, or Berkshire, as he pleased: and I should let every
body know my independence.

He again proposed himself, in very polite terms, for my banker. But I, as civilly, declined
his offer.

This conversation was to be, all of it, in the main, agreeable. He asked whether I would choose
to lodge in the town of Windsor, or out of it?

As near the castle, I said, as possible, for the convenience of going constantly to the public
worship; an opportunity I had been very long deprived of.

He should be very glad, he told me, if he could procure me accommodations in any one of the
canon's houses; which he imagined would be more agreeable to me than any other, on many accounts.
And as he could depend upon my promise, Never to have any other man but himself, on the condition
to which he had so cheerfully subscribed, he should be easy; since it was now his part, in
earnest, to set about recommending himself to my favour, by the only way he knew it would be
done. Adding, with a very serious air--I am but a young man, Madam; but I have run a long course:
let not your purity of mind incline you to despise me for the acknowledgement. It is high time
to be weary of it, and to reform; since, like Solomon, I can say, There is nothing new under
the sun: but that it is my belief, that a life of virtue can afford such pleasures, on reflection,
as will be for ever blooming, for ever new!

I was agreeably surprised. I looked at him, I believe, as if I doubted my ears and my eyes.
His aspect however became his words.

I expressed my satisfaction in terms so agreeable to him, that he said, he found a delight
in this early dawning of a better day to him, and in my approbation, which he had never received
from the success of the most favoured of his pursuits.

Surely, my dear, the man must be in earnest. He could not have said this; he could not have
thought it, had he not. What followed made me still readier to believe him.

In the midst of my wild vagaries, said he, I have ever preserved a reverence for religion,
and for religious men. I always called another cause, when any of my libertine companions,
in pursuance of Lord Shaftesbury's test (which is a part of the rake's creed, and what I may
call the whetstone of infidelity,) endeavoured to turn the sacred subject into ridicule. On
this very account I have been called by good men of the clergy, who nevertheless would have
it that I was a practical rake, the decent rake: and indeed I had too much pride in my shame,
to disown the name of rake.

This, Madam, I am the readier to confess, as it may give you hope, that the generous task of
my reformation, which I flatter myself you will have the goodness to undertake, will not be
so difficult a one as you may have imagined; for it has afforded me some pleasure in my retired
hours, when a temporary remorse has struck me for any thing I have done amiss, that I should
one day delight in another course of life: for, unless we can, I dare say, no durable good
is to be expected from the endeavour. Your example, Madam, must do all, must confirm all.*

     * That he proposes one day to reform, and that he has sometimes good
motions, see Vol.I. Letter XXXIV.

The divine grace, or favour, Mr. Lovelace, must do all, and confirm all. You know not how much
you please me, that I can talk to you in this dialect.

And I then thought of his generosity to his pretty rustic; and of his kindness to his tenants.

Yet, Madam, be pleased to remember one thing; reformation cannot be a sudden work. I have infinite
vivacity: it is that which runs away with me. Judge, dearest Madam, by what I am going to confess,
that I have a prodigious way to journey on, before a good person will think me tolerable; since
though I have read in some of our perfectionists enough to make a better man than myself either
run into madness or despair about the grace you mention, yet I cannot enter into the meaning
of the word, nor into the modus of its operation. Let me not then be checked, when I mention
your example for my visible reliance; and instead of using such words, till I can better understand
them, suppose all the rest included in the profession of that reliance.

I told him, that, although I was somewhat concerned at his expression, and surprised at so
much darkness, as (for want of another word) I would call it, in a man of his talents and learning,
yet I was pleased with his ingenuousness. I wished him to encourage this way of thinking. I
told him, that his observation, that no durable good was to be expected from any new course,
were there was not a delight taken in it, was just; but that the delight would follow by use.

And twenty things of this sort I even preached to him; taking care, however, not to be tedious,
nor to let my expanded heart give him a contracted or impatient blow. And, indeed, he took
visible pleasure in what I said, and even hung upon the subject, when I, to try him, once or
twice, seemed ready to drop it: and proceeded to give me a most agreeable instance, that he
could at times think both deeply and seriously.--Thus it was.

He was once, he said, dangerously wounded in a duel, in the left arm, baring it, to shew me
the scar: that this (notwithstanding a great effusion of blood, it being upon an artery) was
followed by a violent fever, which at last fixed upon his spirits; and that so obstinately,
that neither did he desire life, nor his friends expect it: that, for a month together, his
heart, as he thought, was so totally changed, that he despised his former courses, and particularly
that rashness which had brought him to the state he was in, and his antagonist (who, however,
was the aggressor) into a much worse: that in this space he had thought which at times still
gave him pleasure to reflect upon: and although these promising prospects changed, as he recovered
health and spirits, yet he parted with them with so much reluctance, that he could not help
shewing it in a copy of verses, truly blank ones, he said; some of which he repeated, and (advantaged
by the grace which he gives to every thing he repeats) I thought them very tolerable ones;
the sentiments, however, much graver than I expected from him.

He has promised me a copy of the lines; and then I shall judge better of their merit; and so
shall you. The tendency of them was, 'That, since sickness only gave him a proper train of
thinking, and that his restored health brought with it a return to his evil habits, he was
ready to renounce those gifts of nature for those of contemplation.'

He farther declared, that although these good motions went off (as he had owned) on his recovery,
yet he had better hopes now, from the influence of my example, and from the reward before him,
if he persevered: and that he was the more hopeful that he should, as his present resolution
was made in a full tide of health and spirits; and when he had nothing to wish for but perseverance,
to entitle himself to my favour.

I will not throw cold water, Mr. Lovelace, said I, on a rising flame: but look to it! for I
shall endeavour to keep you up to this spirit. I shall measure your value of me by this test:
and I would have you bear those charming lines of Mr. Rowe for ever in your mind; you, who
have, by your own confession, so much to repent of; and as the scar, indeed, you shewed me,
will, in one instance, remind you to your dying day.

The lines, my dear, are from the poet's Ulysses; you have heard me often admire them; and I
repeated them to him:

      Habitual evils change not on a sudden:
      But many days must pass, and many sorrows;
      Conscious remorse and anguish must be felt,
      To curb desire, to break the stubborn will,
      And work a second nature in the soul,
      Ere Virtue can resume the place she lost:
      'Tis else dissimulation--

He had often read these lines, he said; but never tasted them before.--By his soul, (the unmortified
creature swore,) and as he hoped to be saved, he was now in earnest in his good resolutions.
He had said, before I repeated those lines from Rowe, that habitual evils could not be changed
on a sudden: but he hoped he should not be thought a dissembler, if he were not enabled to
hold his good purposes; since ingratitude and dissimulation were vices that of all others he
abhorred.

May you ever abhor them, said I. They are the most odious of all vices.

I hope, my dear Miss Howe, I shall not have occasion, in my future letters, to contradict these
promising appearances. Should I have nothing on his side to combat with, I shall be very far
from being happy, from the sense of my fault, and the indignation of all my relations. So shall
not fail of condign punishment for it, from my inward remorse on account of my forfeited character.
But the least ray of hope could not dart in upon me, without my being willing to lay hold of
the very first opportunity to communicate it to you, who take so generous a share in all my
concerns.

Nevertheless, you may depend upon it, my dear, that these agreeable assurances, and hopes of
his begun reformation, shall not make me forget my caution. Not that I think, at worst, any
more than you, that he dare to harbour a thought injurious to my honour: but he is very various,
and there is an apparent, and even an acknowledged unfixedness in his temper, which at times
gives me uneasiness. I am resolved therefore to keep him at a distance from my person and my
thoughts, as much as I can: for whether all men are or are not encroachers, I am sure Mr. Lovelace
is one.

Hence it is that I have always cast about, and will continue to cast about, what ends he may
have in view from this proposal, or from that report. In a word, though hopeful of the best,
I will always be fearful of the worst, in every thing that admits of doubt. For it is better,
in such a situation as mine, to apprehend without cause, than to subject myself to surprise
for want of forethought.

Mr. Lovelace is gone to Windsor, having left two servants to attend me. He purposes to be back
to-morrow.

I have written to my aunt Hervey, to supplicate her interest in my behalf, for my clothes,
books, and money; signifying to her, 'That, if I may be restored to the favour of my family,
and allowed a negative only, as to any man who may be proposed to me, and be used like a daughter,
a niece, and a sister, I will stand by my offer to live single, and submit, as I ought, to
a negative from my father.' Intimating, nevertheless, 'That it were perhaps better, after the
usage I have received from my brother and sister, that I may be allowed to be distant from
them, as well for their sakes as for my own,' (meaning, as I suppose it will be taken, at my
Dairy-house)--offering, 'to take my father's directions as to the manner I shall live in, the
servants I shall have, and in every thing that shall shew the dutiful subordination to which
I am willing to conform.'

My aunt will know by my letter to my sister how to direct to me, if she be permitted to favour
me with a line.

I am equally earnest with her in this letter, as I was with my sister in that I wrote to her,
to obtain for me a speedy reconciliation, that I not be further precipitated; intimating, 'That,
by a timely lenity, all may pass for a misunderstanding only, which, otherwise, will be thought
equally disgraceful to them, and to me; appealing to her for the necessity I was under to do
what I did.'--

Had I owned that I was overreached, and forced away against my intention, might they not, as
a proof of the truth of my assertion, have insisted upon my immediate return to them? And,
if I did not return, would they not have reason to suppose, that I had now altered my mind
(if such were my mind) or had not the power to return?--Then were I to have gone back, must
it not have been upon their own terms? No conditioning with a father! is a maxim with my father,
and with my uncles. If I would have gone, Mr. Lovelace would have opposed it. So I must have
been under his controul, or have run away from him, as it is supposed I did to him, from Harlowe-place.
In what a giddy light would this have made me appear!--Had he constrained me, could I have
appealed to my friends for their protection, without risking the very consequences, to prevent
which (setting up myself presumptuously, as a middle person between flaming spirits,) I have
run into such terrible inconveniencies.

But, after all, must it not give me great anguish of mind, to be forced to sanctify, as I may
say, by my seeming after-approbation, a measure I was so artfully tricked into, and which I
was so much resolved not to take?

How one evil brings on another, is sorrowfully witnessed to by

Your ever-obliged and affectionate, CL. HARLOWE.

LETTER XXV

MR. LOVELACE, TO JOHN BELFORD, ESQ. FRIDAY, APR. 14.

Thou hast often reproached me, Jack, with my vanity, without distinguishing the humourous turn
that accompanies it; and for which, at the same time that thou robbest me of the merit of it
thou admirest me highly. Envy gives thee the indistinction: Nature inspires the admiration:
unknown to thyself it inspires it. But thou art too clumsy and too short-sighted a mortal,
to know how to account even for the impulses by which thou thyself art moved.

Well, but this acquits thee not of my charge of vanity, Lovelace, methinks thou sayest.

And true thou sayest: for I have indeed a confounded parcel of it. But, if men of parts may
not be allowed to be in vain, who should! and yet, upon second thoughts, men of parts have
the least occasion of any to be vain; since the world (so few of them are there in it) are
ready to find them out, and extol them. If a fool can be made sensible that there is a man
who has more understanding than himself, he is ready enough to conclude, that such a man must
be a very extraordinary creature.

And what, at this rate, is the general conclusion to be drawn from the premises?--Is it not,
That no man ought to be vain? But what if a man can't help it!--This, perhaps, may be my case.
But there is nothing upon which I value myself so much as upon my inventions. And for the soul
of me, I cannot help letting it be seen, that I do. Yet this vanity may be a mean, perhaps,
to overthrow me with this sagacious lady.

She is very apprehensive of me I see. I have studied before her and Miss Howe, as often as
I have been with them, to pass for a giddy thoughtless creature. What a folly then to be so
expatiatingly sincere, in my answer to her home put, upon the noises within the garden?--But
such success having attended that contrivance [success, Jack, has blown many a man up!] my
cursed vanity got uppermost, and kept down my caution. The menace to have secreted Solmes,
and that other, that I had thoughts to run away with her foolish brother, and of my project
to revenge her upon the two servants, so much terrified the dear creature, that I was forced
to sit down to muse after means to put myself right in her opinion.

Some favourable incidents, at the time, tumbled in from my agent in her family; at least such
as I was determined to make favourable: and therefore I desired admittance; and this before
she could resolve any thing against me; that is to say, while her admiration of my intrepidity
kept resolution in suspense.

Accordingly, I prepared myself to be all gentleness, all obligingness, all serenity; and as
I have now and then, and always had, more or less, good motions pop up in my mind, I encouraged
and collected every thing of this sort that I had ever had from novicehood to maturity, [not
long in recollecting, Jack,] in order to bring the dear creature into good humour with me:*
And who knows, thought I, if I can hold it, and proceed, but I may be able to lay a foundation
fit to build my grand scheme upon!--LOVE, thought I, is not naturally a doubter: FEAR is, I
will try to banish the latter: nothing then but love will remain. CREDULITY is the God of Love's
prime minister, and they never are asunder.

     * He had said, Letter XVIII. that he would make reformation
       his stalking-horse, &c.

     He then acquaints his friend with what passed between him
     and the Lady,   in relation to his advices from Harlowe-
     place, and to his proposal about lodgings, pretty much to
     the same purpose as in her preceding Letter.

     When he cones to mention his proposal of the Windsor
     lodgings, thus heexpresses himself:

Now, Belford, can it enter into thy leaden head, what I meant by this proposal!--I know it
cannot. And so I'll tell thee.

To leave her for a day or two, with a view to serve her by my absence, would, as I thought,
look like a confiding in her favour. I could not think of leaving her, thou knowest, while
I had reason to believe her friends would pursue us; and I began to apprehend that she would
suspect that I made a pretence of that intentional pursuit to keep about her and with her.
But now that they had declared against it, and that they would not receive her if she went
back, (a declaration she had better hear first from me, than from Miss Howe, or any other,)
what should hinder me from giving her this mark of my obedience; especially as I could leave
Will, who is a clever fellow, and can do any thing but write and spell, and Lord M.'s Jonas
(not as guards, to be sure, but as attendants only); the latter to be dispatched to me occasionally
by the former, whom I could acquaint with my motions?

Then I wanted to inform myself, why I had not congratulatory letters from Lady Sarah and Lady
Betty, and from my cousins Montague, to whom I had written, glorying in my beloved's escape;
which letters, if properly worded, might be made necessary to shew her as matters proceed.

As to Windsor, I had no design to carry her particularly thither: but somewhere it was proper
to name, as she condescended to ask my advice about it. London, I durst not; but very cautiously;
and so as to make it her own option: for I must tell thee, that there is such a perverseness
in the sex, that when they ask your advice, they do it only to know your opinion, that they
may oppose it; though, had not the thing in question been your choice, perhaps it had been theirs.

I could easily give reasons against Windsor, after I had pretended to be there; and this would
have looked the better, as it was a place of my own nomination; and shewn her that I had no
fixed scheme. Never was there in woman such a sagacious, such an all-alive apprehension, as
in this. Yet it is a grievous thing to an honest man to be suspected.

Then, in my going or return, I can call upon Mrs. Greme. She and my beloved had a great deal
of talk together. If I knew what it was about; and that either, upon their first acquaintance,
was for benefiting herself by the other; I might contrive to serve them both, without hurting
myself: for these are the most prudent ways of doing friendships, and what are not followed
by regrets, though the served should prove ingrateful. Then Mrs. Greme corresponds by pen-and-ink
with her farmer-sister where we are: something may possibly arise that way, either of a convenient
nature, which I may pursue; or of an inconvenient nature, which I may avoid.

Always be careful of back doors, is a maxim with me in all my exploits. Whoever knows me, knows
that I am no proud man. I can talk as familiarly to servants as to principals, when I have
a mind to make it worth their while to oblige me in any thing. Then servants are but as the
common soldiers in an army, they do all the mischief frequently without malice, and merely,
good souls! for mischief-sake.

I am most apprehensive about Miss Howe. She has a confounded deal of wit, and wants only a
subject, to shew as much roguery: and should I be outwitted with all my sententious boasting
of conceit of my own nostrum-mongership--[I love to plague thee, who art a pretender to accuracy,
and a surface-skimmer in learning, with out-of-the-way words and phrases] I should certainly
hang, drown, or shoot myself.

Poor Hickman! I pity him for the prospect he has with such a virago! But the fellow's a fool,
God wot! And now I think of it, it is absolutely necessary for complete happiness in the married
state, that one should be a fool [an argument I once held with this very Miss Howe.] But then
the fool should know the other's superiority; otherwise the obstinate one will disappoint the
wise one.

But my agent Joseph has helped me to secure this quarter, as I have hinted to thee more than once.

LETTER XXVI

MR. LOVELACE, TO JOHN BELFORD, ESQ. [IN CONTINUATION.]

But is it not a confounded thing that I cannot fasten an obligation upon this proud beauty?
I have two motives in endeavouring to prevail upon her to accept of money and raiment from
me: one; the real pleasure I should have in the accommodating of the haughty maid; and to think
there was something near her, and upon her, that I could call mine: the other, in order to
abate her severity and humble her a little.

Nothing more effectually brings down a proud spirit, than a sense of lying under pecuniary
obligations. This has always made me solicitous to avoid laying myself under any such: yet,
sometimes, formerly, have I been put to it, and cursed the tardy resolution of the quarterly
periods. And yet I ever made shift to avoid anticipation: I never would eat the calf in the
cow's belly, as Lord M.'s phrase is: for what is that, but to hold our lands upon tenant-courtesy,
the vilest of all tenures? To be denied a fox-chace, for breaking down a fence upon my own
grounds? To be clamoured at for repairs studied for, rather than really wanted? To be prated
to by a bumpkin with his hat on, and his arms folded, as if he defied your expectations of
that sort; his foot firmly fixed, as if upon his own ground, and you forced to take his arch
leers, and stupid gybes; he intimating, by the whole of his conduct, that he had had it in
his power to oblige you, and, if you behave civilly, may oblige you again? I, who think I have
a right to break every man's head I pass by, if I like not his looks, to bear this!--No more
could I do it, then I could borrow of an insolent uncle, or inquisitive aunt, who would thence
think themselves entitled to have an account of all my life and actions laid before them for
their review and censure.

My charmer, I see, has a pride like my own: but she has no distinction in her pride: nor knows
the pretty fool that there is nothing nobler, nothing more delightful, than for loves to be
conferring and receiving obligations from each other. In this very farm-yard, to give thee
a familiar instance, I have more than once seen this remark illustrated. A strutting rascal
of a cock have I beheld chuck, chuck, chuck, chuck-ing his mistress to him, when he has found
a single barley-corn, taking it up with his bill, and letting it drop five or six times, still
repeating his chucking invitation: and when two or three of his feathered ladies strive who
shall be the first for it [O Jack! a cock is a grand signor of a bird!] he directs the bill
of the foremost to it; and when she has got the dirty pearl, he struts over her with an erected
crest, cling round her with dropt wings, sweeping the dust in humble courtship: while the obliged
she, half-shy, half-willing, by her cowering tail, prepared wings, yet seemingly affrighted
eyes, and contracted neck, lets one see that she knows the barley-corn was not all he called
her for.

     When he comes to that part of his narrative, where he
     mentions of the proposing of the Lady's maid Hannah, or one
     of the young Sorlings, to attend her, thus he writes:

Now, Belford, canst thou imagine what I meant by proposing Hannah, or one of the girls here,
for her attendant? I'll give thee a month to guess.

Thou wilt not pretend to guess, thou say'st.

Well, then I'll tell thee.

Believing she would certainly propose to have that favourite wench about her, as soon as she
was a little settled, I had caused the girl to be inquired after, with an intent to make interest,
some how or other, that a month's warning should be insisted on by her master or mistress,
or by some other means, which I had not determined upon, to prevent her coming to her. But
fortune fights for me. The wench is luckily ill; a violent rheumatic disorder, which has obliged
her to leave her place, confines her to her chamber. Poor Hannah! How I pity the girl! These
things are very hard upon industrious servants!--I intend to make the poor wench a small present
on the occasion--I know it will oblige my charmer.

And so, Jack, pretending not to know any thing of the matter, I pressed her to send for Hannah.
She knew I had always a regard for this servant, because of her honest love to her lady: but
now I have greater regard for her than ever. Calamity, though a poor servant's calamity, will
rather increase than diminish good will, with a truly generous master or mistress.

As to one of the young Sorling's attendance, there was nothing at all in proposing that; for
if either of them had been chosen by her, and permitted by the mother [two chances in that!]
it would have been only till I had fixed upon another. And, if afterwards they had been loth
to part, I could easily have given my beloved to a jealousy, which would have done the business;
or to the girl, who would have quitted her country dairy, such a relish for a London one, and
as would have made it very convenient for her to fall in love with Will; or perhaps I could
have done still better for her with Lord M.'s chaplain, who is very desirous of standing well
with his lord's presumptive heir.

A blessing on thy honest heart, Lovelace! thou'lt say; for thou art for providing for every body!

     He gives an account of the serious part of their
     conversation, with no great variation from the Lady's
     account of it: and when he comes to that part of it, where
     he bids her remember, that reformation cannot be a sudden
     thing, he asks his friend:

Is not this fair play? Is it not dealing ingenuously? Then the observation, I will be bold
to say, is founded in truth and nature. But there was a little touch of policy in it besides;
that the lady, if I should fly out again, should not think me too gross an hypocrite: for,
as I plainly told her, I was afraid, that my fits of reformation were but fits and sallies;
but I hoped her example would fix them into habits. But it is so discouraging a thing to have
my monitress so very good!--I protest I know not how to look up at her! Now, as I am thinking,
if I could pull her down a little nearer to my own level; that is to say, could prevail upon
her to do something that would argue imperfection, something to repent of; we should jog on
much more equally, and be better able to comprehend one another: and so the comfort would be
mutual, and the remorse not all on one side.

     He acknowledges that he was greatly affected and pleased
     with the Lady's serious arguments at the time: but even then
     was apprehensive that his temper would not hold.  Thus he
     writes:

This lady says serious things in so agreeable a manner (and then her voice is all harmony when
she touches a subject she is pleased with) that I could have listened to her for half a day
together. But yet I am afraid, if she falls, as they call it, she will lose a good deal of
that pathos, of that noble self-confidence, which gives a good person, as I now see, a visible
superiority over one not so good.

But, after all, Belford, I would fain know why people call such free-livers as you and me hypocrites.--That's
a word I hate; and should take it very ill to be called by it. For myself, I have as good motions,
and, perhaps, have them as frequently as any body: all the business is, they don't hold; or,
to speak more in character, I don't take the care some do to conceal my lapses.

LETTER XXVII

MISS HOWE, TO MIS CLARISSA HARLOWE SATURDAY, APRIL 15.

Though pretty much pressed in time, and oppressed by my mother's watchfulness, I will write
a few lines upon the new light that has broken in upon your gentleman; and send it by a particular
hand.

I know not what to think of him upon it. He talks well; but judge him by Rowe's lines, he is
certainly a dissembler, odious as the sin of hypocrisy, and, as he says, that other of ingratitude,
are to him.

And, pray, my dear, let me ask, could he have triumphed, as it is said he has done, over so
many of our sex, had he not been egregiously guilty of both sins?

His ingenuousness is the thing that staggers me: yet is he cunning enough to know, that whoever
accuses him first, blunts the edge of an adversary's accusation.

He is certainly a man of sense: there is more hope of such a one than a fool: and there must
be a beginning to a reformation. These I will allow in his favour.

But this, that follows, I think, is the only way to judge of his specious confessions and self-accusations--Does
he confess any thing that you knew not before, or that you are not likely to find out from
others?--If nothing else, what does he confess to his own disadvantage? You have heard of his
duels: you have heard of his seductions.--All the world has. He owns, therefore, what it would
be to no purpose to conceal; and his ingenuousness is a salvo--'Why, this, Madam, is no more
than Mr. Lovelace himself acknowledges.'

Well, but what is now to be done?--You must make the best of your situation: and as you say,
so he has proposed to you of Windsor, and his canon's house. His readiness to leave you, and
go himself in quest of a lodging, likewise looks well. And I think there is nothing can be
so properly done, as (whether you get to a canon's house or not) that the canon should join
you together in wedlock as soon as possible.

I much approve, however, of all your cautions, of all your vigilance, and of every thing you
have done, but of your meeting him. Yet, in my disapprobation of that, I judge by that event
only: for who would have divined it would have been concluded as it did? But he is the devil
by his own account: and had he run away with the wretched Solmes, and your more wretched brother,
and himself been transported for life, he should have had my free consent for all three.

What use does he make of that Joseph Leman!--His ingenuousness, I must more than once say,
confounds me; but if, my dear, you can forgive your brother for the part he put that fellow
upon acting, I don't know whether you ought to be angry at Lovelace. Yet I have wished fifty
times, since Lovelace got you away, that you were rid of him, whether it were by a burning
fever, by hanging, by drowning, or by a broken neck; provided it were before he laid you under
a necessity to go into mourning for him.

I repeat my hitherto rejected offer. May I send it safely by your old man? I have reasons for
not sending it by Hickman's servant; unless I had a bank note. Inquiring for such may cause
distrust. My mother is so busy, so inquisitive--I don't love suspicious tempers.

And here she is continually in and out--I must break off.

*****

Mr. Hickman begs his most respectful compliments to you, with offer of his services. I told
him I would oblige him, because minds in trouble take kindly any body's civilities: but that
he was not to imagine that he particularly obliged me by this; since I should think the man
or woman either blind or stupid who admired not a person of your exalted merit for your own
sake, and wished not to serve you without view to other reward than the honour of serving you.

To be sure, that was his principal motive, with great daintiness he said it: but with a kiss
of his hand, and a bow to my feet, he hoped, that a fine lady's being my friend did not lessen
the merit of the reverence he really had for her. AFTERNOON.

I detain your messenger while I write an answer to yours; the poor old man not being very well.

You dishearten me a good deal about Mr. Lovelace. I may be too willing from my sad circumstances
to think the best of him. If his pretences to reformation are but pretences, what must be his
intent? But can the heart of man be so very vile? Can he, dare he, mock the Almighty? But I
may not, from one very sad reflection, think better of him; that I am thrown too much into
his power, to make it necessary for him (except he were to intend the very utmost villany by
me) to be such a shocking hypocrite? He must, at least be in earnest at the time he gives the
better hopes. Surely he must. You yourself must join with me in this hope, or you could not
wish me to be so dreadfully yoked.

But after all, I had rather, much rather, be independent of him, and of his family, although
I have an high opinion of them; at least till I see what my own may be brought to.--Otherwise,
I think, it were best for me, at once, to cast myself into Lady Betty's protection. All would
then be conducted with decency, and perhaps many mortifications would be spared me. But then
I must be his, at all adventures, and be thought to defy my own family. And shall I not first
see the issue of one application? And yet I cannot make this, till I am settled somewhere,
and at a distance from him.

Mrs. Sorlings shewed me a letter this morning, which she had received from her sister Greme
last night; in which Mrs. Greme (hoping I would forgive her forward zeal if her sister thinks
fit to shew her letter to me) 'wishes (and that for all the noble family's sake, and she hopes
she may say for my own) that I will be pleased to yield to make his honour, as she calls him,
happy.' She grounds her officiousness, as she calls it, upon what he was so condescending [her
word also] to say to her yesterday, in his way to Windsor, on her presuming to ask, if she
might soon give him joy? 'That no man ever loved a woman as he loves me: that no woman ever
so well deserved to be beloved: that he loves me with such a purity as he had never believed
himself capable of, or that a mortal creature could have inspired him with; looking upon me
as all soul; as an angel sent down to save his;' and a great deal more of this sort: 'but that
he apprehends my consent to make him happy is at a greater distance than he wishes; and complained
of too severe restrictions I had laid upon him before I honoured him with my confidence: which
restrictions must be as sacred to him, as if they were parts of the marriage contract,' &c.

What, my dear, shall I say to this? How shall I take it? Mrs. Greme is a good woman. Mrs. Sorlings
is a good woman. And this letter agrees with the conversation between Mr. Lovelace and me,
which I thought, and still think, so agreeable.* Yet what means the man by foregoing the opportunities
he has had to declare himself?--What mean his complaints of my restrictions to Mrs. Greme?
He is not a bashful man.--But you say, I inspire people with an awe of me.--An awe, my dear!--As
how?

     * This letter Mrs. Greme (with no bad design on her part) was put upon
writing by Mr. Lovelace himself, as will be seen in Letter XXXV.

I am quite petulant, fretful, and peevish, with myself, at times, to find that I am bound to
see the workings of the subtle, or this giddy spirit, which shall I call it?

How am I punished, as I frequently think, for my vanity, in hoping to be an example to young
persons of my sex! Let me be but a warning, and I will now be contented. For, be my destiny
what it may, I shall never be able to hold up my head again among my best friends and worthiest
companions.

It is one of the cruelest circumstances that attends the faults of the inconsiderate, that
she makes all who love her unhappy, and gives joy only to her own enemies, and to the enemies
of her family.

What an useful lesson would this afford, were it properly inculcated at the time that the tempted
mind was balancing upon a doubtful adventure?

You know not, my dear, the worth of a virtuous man; and, noble-minded as you are in most particulars,
you partake of the common weakness of human nature, in being apt to slight what is in your
own power.

You would not think of using Mr. Lovelace, were he your suitor, as you do the much worthier
Mr. Hickman--would you?--You know who says in my mother's case, 'Much will bear, much shall
bear, all the world through.'* Mr. Hickman, I fancy, would be glad to know the lady's name,
who made such an observation. He would think it hardly possible, but such a one should benefit
by her own remark; and would be apt to wish his Miss Howe acquainted with her.

     * See Vol.I. Letter X.

Gentleness of heart, surely, is not despicable in a man. Why, if it be, is the highest distinction
a man can arrive at, that of a gentleman?--A distinction which a prince may not deserve. For
manners, more than birth, fortune, or title, are requisite in this character. Manners are indeed
the essence of it. And shall it be generally said, and Miss Howe not be an exception to it
(as you once wrote), that our sex are best dealt with by boisterous and unruly spirits?*

     * See Vol.II. Letter III.

Forgive me, my dear, and love me as you used to do. For although my fortunes are changed, my
heart is not: Nor ever will, while it bids my pen tell you, that it must cease to bear, when
it is not as much yours as

Your CL. HARLOWE.

Mr. Lovelace has seen divers apartments at Windsor; but not one, he says, that he thought fit
for me, and which, at the same time, answered my description.

He has been very solicitous to keep to the letter of my instructions: which looked well: and
the better I like him, as, although he proposed that town, he came back, dissuading me from
it: for he said, that, in his journey from thence, he had thought Windsor, although of his
own proposal, a wrong choice; because I coveted privacy, and that was a place generally visited
and admired.*

     * This inference of the Lady in his favour is exactly what he had hoped
for. See Letter XXV. of this volume.

I told him, that if Mrs. Sorlings thought me not an incumbrance, I would be willing to stay
here a little longer; provided he would leave me, and go to Lord M.'s, or to London, which
ever he thought best.

He hoped, he said, that he might suppose me absolutely safe from the insults or attempts of
my brother; and, therefore, if it should make me easier, he would obey, for a few days at least.

He again proposed to send for Hannah. I told him I designed to do so, through you--And shall
I beg of you, my dear, to cause the honest creature to be sent to? Your faithful Robert, I
think, knows where she is. Perhaps she will be permitted to quit her place directly, by allowing
a month's wages, which I will repay her. He took notice of the serious humour he found me in,
and of the redness of my eyes. I had just been answering your letter; and had he not approached
me, on his coming off his journey, in a very respectful manner; had he not made an unexceptionable
report of his inquiries, and been so ready to go from me, at the very first word; I was prepared
(notwithstanding the good terms we parted upon when he set out for Windsor) to have given him
a very unwelcome reception: for the contents of your last letter had so affected me, that the
moment I saw him, I beheld with indignation the seducer, who had been the cause of all the
evils I suffer, and have suffered.

He hinted to me, that he had received a letter from Lady Betty, and another (as I understood
him) from one of the Miss Montagues. If they take notice of my in them, I wonder that he did
not acquaint me with the contents. I am afraid, my dear, that his relations are among those
who think I have taken a rash and inexcusable step. It is not to my credit to let even them
know how I have been frighted out of myself: and yet perhaps they would hold me unworthy of
their alliance, if they were to think my flight a voluntary one. O my dear, how uneasy to us
are our reflections upon every doubtful occurrence, when we know we have been prevailed upon
to do a wrong thing!

SUNDAY MORNING.

Ah! this man, my dear! We have had warmer dialogues than ever yet we have had. At fair argument,
I find I need not fear him;* but he is such a wild, such an ungovernable creature [he reformed!]
that I am half afraid of him.

     * See this confirmed by Mr. Lovelace, Letter XI. of this volume.

He again, on my declaring myself uneasy at his stay with me here, proposed that I would put
myself into Lady Betty's protection; assuring me that he thought he could not leave me at Mrs.
Sorlings's with safety to myself. And upon my declining to do that, for the reasons I gave
you in my last,* he urged me to make a demand of my estate.

     * See Letter XXVIII. of this volume.

He knew it, I told him, to be my resolution not to litigate with my father.

Nor would he put me upon it, he replied, but as the last thing. But if my spirit would not
permit me to be obliged, as I called it, to any body, and yet if my relations would refuse
me my own, he knew not how I could keep up that spirit, without being put to inconveniences,
which would give him infinite concern--Unless--unless--unless, he said, hesitating, as if afraid
to speak out--unless I would take the only method I could take, to obtain the possession of my own.

What is that, Sir?

Sure the man saw by my looks, when he came with his creeping unless's, that I guessed what
he meant.

Ah! Madam, can you be at a loss to know what that method is?--They will not dispute with a
man that right which they contest with you.

Why said he with a man, instead of with him? Yet he looked as if he wanted to be encouraged
to say more.

So, Sir, you would have me employ a lawyer, would you, notwithstanding what I have ever declared
as to litigating with my father?

No, I would not, my dearest creature, snatching my hand, and pressing it with his lips--except
you would make me the lawyer.

Had he said me at first, I should have been above the affectation of mentioning a lawyer.

I blushed. The man pursued not the subject so ardently, but that it was more easy as well as
more natural to avoid it than to fall into it.

Would to Heaven he might, without offending!--But I so over-awed him!--[over-awed him!--Your*
notion, my dear!]--And so the over-awed, bashful man went off from the subject, repeating his
proposal, that I would demand my own estate, or empower some man of the law to demand it, if
I would not [he put in] empower a happier man to demand it. But it could not be amiss, he thought,
to acquaint my two trustees, that I intended to assume it.

     * See Letter XIX. of this volume.

I should know better what to do, I told him, when he was at a distance from me, and known to
be so. I suppose, Sir, that if my father propose my return, and engage never to mentions Solmes
to me, nor any other man, but by my consent, and I agree, upon that condition, to think no
more of you, you will acquiesce.

I was willing to try whether he had the regard to all of my previous declarations, which he
pretended to have to some of them.

He was struck all of a heap.

What say you, Mr. Lovelace? You know, all you mean is for my good. Surely I am my own mistress:
surely I need not ask your leave to make what terms I please for myself, so long as I break
none with you?

He hemm'd twice or thrice--Why, Madam--why, Madam, I cannot say--then pausing--and rising from
his seat with petulance; I see plainly enough, said he, the reason why none of my proposals
can be accepted: at last I am to be a sacrifice to your reconciliation with your implacable family.

It has always been your respectful way, Mr. Lovelace, to treat my family in this free manner.
But pray, Sir, when you call others implacable, see that you deserve not the same censure yourself.

He must needs say, there was no love lost between some of my family and him; but he had not
deserved of them what they had of him.

Yourself being judge, I suppose, Sir?

All the world, you yourself, Madam, being judge.

Then, Sir, let me tell you, had you been less upon your defiances, they would not have been
irritated so much against you. But nobody ever heard, that avowed despite to the relations
of a person was a proper courtship, either to that person, or to her friends.

Well, Madam, all that I know is, that their malice against me is such, that, if you determine
to sacrifice me, you may be reconciled when you please.

And all I know, Sir, is, that if I do give my father the power of a negative, and he will be
contented with that, it will be but my duty to give it him; and if I preserve one to myself,
I shall break through no obligation to you.

Your duty to your capricious brother, not to your father, you mean, Madam.

If the dispute lay between my brother and me at first, surely, Sir, a father may choose which
party he will take.

He may, Madam--but that exempts him not from blame for all that, if he take the wrong--

Different people will judge differently, Mr. Lovelace, of the right and the wrong. You judge
as you please. Shall not others as they please? And who has a right to controul a father's
judgment in his own family, and in relation to his own child?

I know, Madam, there is no arguing with you. But, nevertheless, I had hoped to have made myself
some little merit with you, so as that I might not have been the preliminary sacrifice to a
reconciliation.

Your hope, Sir, had been better grounded if you had had my consent to my abandoning of my father's
house--

Always, Madam, and for ever, to be reminded of the choice you would have made of that damn'd
Solmes--rather than--

Not so hasty! not so rash, Mr. Lovelace! I am convinced that there was no intention to marry
me to that Solmes on Wednesday.

So I am told they now give out, in order to justify themselves at your expense. Every body
living, Madam, is obliged to you for your kind thoughts but I.

Excuse me, good Mr. Lovelace [waving my hand, and bowing], that I am willing to think the best
of my father.

Charming creature! said he, with what a bewitching air is that said!--And with a vehemence
in his manner would have snatched my hand. But I withdrew it, being much offended with him.

I think, Madam, my sufferings for your sake might have entitled me to some favour.

My sufferings, Sir, for your impetuous temper, set against your sufferings for my sake, I humbly
conceive, leave me very little your debtor.

Lord! Madam, [assuming a drawling air] What have you suffered?--Nothing but what you can easily
forgive. You have been only made a prisoner in your father's house, by way of doing credit
to your judgment!--You have only had an innocent and faithful servant turned out of your service,
because you loved her!--You have only had your sister's confident servant set over you, with
leave to tease and affront you--!

Very well, Sir!

You have only had an insolent brother take upon him to treat you like a slave, and as insolent
a sister to undermine you in every body's favour, on pretence to keep you out of hands, which,
if as vile as they vilely report, are not, however, half so vile and cruel as their own.

Go on, Sir, if you please!

You have only been persecuted, in order to oblige you to have a sordid fellow, whom you have
professed to hate, and whom every body despises! The license has been only got! The parson
has only been had in readiness! The day, a near, a very near day, had been only fixed! And
you were only to be searched for your correspondencies, and still closer confined till the
day came, in order to deprive you of all means of escaping the snare laid for you!--But all
this you can forgive! You can wish you had stood all this; inevitable as the compulsion must
have been!--And the man who, at the hazard of his life, had delivered you from all these mortifications,
is the only person you cannot forgive!

Can't you go on, Sir? You see I have patience to hear you. Can't you go on, Sir?

I can, Madam, with my sufferings: which I confess ought not to be mentioned, were I at last
to be rewarded in the manner I hoped.

Your sufferings then, if you please, Sir?

Affrontingly forbidden your father's house, after encouragement given, without any reasons
they knew not before to justify the prohibition: forced upon a rencounter I wished to avoid:
the first I ever, so provoked, wished to avoid. And that, because the wretch was your brother!

Wretch, Sir!--And my brother!--This could be from no man breathing, but from him before me!

Pardon me, Madam!--But oh! how unworthy to be your brother!--The quarrel grafted upon an old
one, when at college; he universally known to be the aggressor; and revived for views equally
sordid and injurious both to yourself and me--giving life to him, who would have taken away mine!

Your generosity THIS, Sir; not your sufferings: a little more of your sufferings, if you please!--I
hope you do not repent, that you did not murder my brother!

My private life hunted into! My morals decried! Some of the accusers not unfaulty!

That's an aspersion, Sir!

Spies set upon my conduct! One hired to bribe my own servant's fidelity; perhaps to have poisoned
me at last, if the honest fellow had not--

Facts, Mr. Lovelace!--Do you want facts in the display of your sufferings?--None of your perhaps's,
I beseech you!

Menaces every day, and defiances, put into every one's mouth against me! Forced to creep about
in disguises--and to watch all hours--

And in all weathers, I suppose, Sir--That, I remember, was once your grievance! In all weathers,
Sir!* and all these hardships arising from yourself, not imposed by me.
