 Free Traders argue that free trade will prevent war, by making evident
the inconveniences thereby occasioned to commerce, yet history has never shown that such considerations
have been of much weight when strong national feelings are aroused. Nor is it, in my opinion,
a desirable thing that they should have a decisive effect. The duomo, but furrowed caterpillars,
