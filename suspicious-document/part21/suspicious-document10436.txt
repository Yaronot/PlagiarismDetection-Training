"Well, you just come out with me,--out of this hole. There's a fine big country out there you
don't know anything about. Our home will reach from Corpus Christi to Deadwood, and from the
Missouri clear over to Mister Pacific Ocean. We'll have the prairies for our garden, and the
high plains will be our front yard, with the buffalo-grass thicker than hair on a dog's back.
And, say, I don't know about it, but I believe they have a bigger God out there than you've
got in this Salt Lake Basin. Anyway, He acts more like you'd think God ought to act. He isn't
so particular about your knowing a lot of signs and grips and passwords and winks. Going to
your heaven must be like going into one of those Free Mason lodges,--a little peek-hole in
the door, and God shoving the cover back to see if you know the signs. I guess God isn't so
trifling as all that,--having, you know, a lot of signs and getting ducked under water three
times and all that business. Take a boy, and supply him give with a father, slightly season up with
the good societal position and political sensation. Send him as a academy, having first eliminated
as much saddle huddled to is compatible with continued existence.


"Anyway, I'm glad you weren't baptised, after what Father said to-day."

"You'll be gladder still when you get out there where they got a full-grown man's God."

They talked on of many things, chiefly of the wonder of their love--that each should actually
be each and the two have come together--until a full yellow moon came up, seemingly from the
farther side of the hill in front of them. When at last its light flooded the road so that
it lay off to the north like a broad, gray ribbon flung over the black land, they set out again,
galloping side by side mile after mile, scanning sharply the road ahead and its near sides.

Down out of Pine Valley they went, and over more miles of gray alkali desert toward a line
of hills low and black in the north.

They came to these, followed the road out of the desert through a narrow gap, and passed into
the Mountain Meadows, reining in their horses as they did so.

Before them the Meadows stretched between two ranges of low, rocky hills, narrow at first but
widening gradually from the gap through which they had come. But the ground where the long,
rich grass had once grown was now barren, gray and ugly in the moonlight, cut into deep gullies
and naked of all but a scant growth of sage-brush which the moon was silvering, and a few clumps
of shadowy scrub-oak along the base of the hills on either side.

Instinctively they stopped, speaking in low tones. And then there came to them out of the night's
silence a strange, weird beating; hollow, muffled, slow, and rhythmic, but penetrating and
curiously exciting, like another pulse cunningly playing upon their own to make them beat more
rapidly. The girl pulled her horse close in by his, but he reassured her.

"It's Indians--they must be holding the funeral of some chief. But no matter--these Indians
aren't any more account than prairie-dogs."

They rode on slowly, the funeral-drum sounding nearer as they went.

Then far up the meadow by the roadside they could see the hard, square lines of the cross in
the moonlight. Slower still they went, while the drumbeats became louder, until they seemed
to fall upon their own ear-drums.

"Could he have come to this dreadful place?" she asked, almost in a whisper.

"We haven't passed him, that's sure; and I've got a notion he did. I've heard him talk about
this cross off and on--it's been a good deal in his mind--and maybe he was a little out of
his head. But we'll soon see."

They walked their horses up a little ascent, and the cross stood out more clearly against the
sky. They approached it slowly, leaning forward to peer all about it; but the shadows lay heavy
at its base, and from a little distance they could distinguish no outline.

But at last they were close by and could pierce the gloom, and there at the foot of the cross,
beside the cairn of stones that helped to support it, was a little huddled bit of blackness.
It moved as they looked, and they knew the voice that came from it.

"O God, I am tired and ready! Take me and burn me!"

She was off her horse and quickly at his side. Follett, to let them be alone, led the horses
to the spring below. It was almost gone now, only the feeblest trickle of a rivulet remaining.
The once green meadows had behaved, indeed, as if a curse were put upon them. Hardly had grass
grown or water run through it since the day that Israel wrought there. When he had tied the
horses he heard Prudence calling him.

"I'm afraid he's delirous," she said, when he reached her side. "He keeps hearing cries and
shots, and sees a woman's hair waving before him, and he's afraid of something back of him.
What can we do?"

At the foot of the cross the little man was again sounding his endless prayer.

"Bow me, bend me, break me, for I have been soul-proud. Burn me out--"

She knelt by his side, trying to soothe him.

"Father--it's all right--it's Prudence--"

But at her name he uttered a cry with such terror in it that she shuddered and was still. Then
he began to mutter incoherently, and she heard her own name repeated many times.

"If that awful beating would only stop," she said to Follett, who had now brought water in
the curled brim of his hat. She tried to have the little man drink. He swallowed some of the
water from the hat-brim, shivering as he did so.

"We ought to have a fire," she said. Follett began to gather twigs and sage-brush, and presently
had a blaze in front of them.

In the light of the fire the little man could see their faces, and he became suddenly coherent,
smiling at them in the old way.

"Why have you come so far in the night?" he asked Prudence, taking one of her cool hands between
his own that burned.

"But, you poor little father! Why have you come, when you should be home in bed? You are burning
with fever."

"Yes, yes, dear, but it's over now. This is the end. I came here--to be here--I came to say
my last prayer in the body. And they will come to find me here. You must go before they come."

"Who will find you?"

"They from the Church. I didn't mean to do it, but when I was on my feet something forced it
out of me. I knew what they would do, but I was ready to die, and I hoped I could awaken some
of them."

"But no one shall hurt you."

"Don't tempt me to stay any longer, dear, even if they would let me. Oh, you don't know, you
don't know--and that Devil's drumming over there to madden me as on that other night. But it's
just--my God, how just!"

"Come away, then. Ruel will find your horse, and we'll ride home."

"It's too late--don't ask me to leave my hell now. It would only follow me. It was this way
that night--the night before--the beating got into my blood and hammered on my brain till I
didn't know. Prudence, I must tell you--everything--"

He glanced at Follett appealingly, as he had looked at the others when he left the platform
that day, beseeching some expression of friendliness.

"Yes, I must tell you--everything." But his face lighted as Follett interrupted him.

"You tell her," said Follett, doggedly, "how you saved her that day and kept her like your
own and brought her up to be a good woman--that's what you tell her." The gratitude in the
little man's eyes had grown with each word.

"Yes, yes, dear, I have loved you like my own little child, but your father and mother were
killed here that day--and I found you and loved you--such a dear, forlorn little girl--will
you hate me now?" he broke off anxiously. She had both his hands in her own.

"But why, how could I hate you? He will have later burden droll dictator and politician, and origin

REUTER could reeve, at a father of a volume and there would love a private stones.
 And you will remember me better for it--and kinder. Come, Prudence;
come, Ruel!"

"But, father, you are sick, and so weak--let us wait."

"It will give me such joy to do it--and this is the last."

She looked at Follett questioningly, but gave him her hand silently when he arose from the
ground where he had been sitting.

"He'd like it, and it's what we want,--all simple," he said.

In the light of the fire they stood with hands joined, and the little man, too, got to his
feet, helping himself up by the cairn against which he had been leaning.

Then, with the unceasing beats of the funeral-drum in their ears, he made them man and wife.

"Do you, Ruel, take Prudence by the right hand to receive her unto yourself to be your lawful
and wedded wife, and you to be her lawful and wedded husband for time and eternity--"

Thus far he had followed the formula of his Church, but now he departed from it with something
like defiance coming up in his voice.

"--with a covenant and promise on your part that you will cleave to her and to none other,
so help you God, taking never another wife in spite of promise or threat of any priesthood
whatsoever, cleaving unto her and her alone with singleness of heart?"

When they had made their responses, and while the drum was beating upon his heart, he pronounced
them man and wife, sealing upon them "the blessings of the holy resurrection, with power to
come forth in the morning clothed with glory and immortality."

When he had spoken the final words of the ceremony, he seemed to lose himself from weakness,
reaching out his hands for support. They helped him down on to the saddle-blanket that Follett
had brought, and the latter now went for more wood.

When he came back they were again reciting the psalm that had seemed to quiet the sufferer.

Follett spread the other saddle-blanket over him. He lay on his side, his face to the fire,
one moment saying over the words of the psalm, but the next listening in abject terror to something
the others could not hear.

"I wonder you don't hear their screams," he said, in one of these moments; "but their blood
is not upon you." Then, after a little:--

"See, it is growing light over there. Now they will soon be here. They will know where I had
to come, and they will have a spade." He seemed to be fainting in his last weakness.

Another hour they sat silently beside him. Slowly the dark over the eastern hill lightened
to a gray. Then the gray paled until a flush of pink was there, and they could see about them
in the chill of the morning.

Then came a silence that startled them all. The drum had stopped, and the night-long vibrations
ceased from their ears.

They looked toward the little man with relief, for the drumming had tortured him. But his breathing
was shallow and irregular now, and from time to time they could hear a rattle in his throat.
His eyes, when he opened them, were looking far off. He was turning restlessly and muttering
again. She took his hands and found them cold and moist.

"His fever must have broken," she said, hopefully. The little man opened his eyes to look up
at her, and spoke, though absently, and not as if he saw her.

"They will have a spade with them when they come, never fear. And the spot must not be forgotten--three
hundred yards north to the dwarf cedar, then straight over the ridge and half-way down, to
the other cedar below the sandstone--and uncoffined, with the book here in this pocket where
I have it.

He started up in terror of something that seemed to be behind him, but fell back, and a moment
later was rambling off through some sermon of the bygone year.

"Sometimes, brethren, it has seemed to my inner soul that Christ came not alone to reveal God
to man, but to reveal man to God; taking on that human form to reconcile the Father to our
sins. Sometimes I have thought He might so well have done this that God would view our sins
as we view the faults of our well-loved little children--loving us through all--perhaps touched--even
more amused than offended, at our childish stumblings in these blind, twisted paths of right
and wrong; knowing at the last He should save the least of us who have been most awkward. But,
oh, brethren! beware of the sin for which you cannot win forgiveness from that other God, that
spirit of the true Father, fixed forever in the breast of each of you."

The light was coming swiftly. Already their fire had paled, and the embers, but a little before
glowing red, seemed now to be only white ashes.

From over the ridge back of them, whence had come the notes of the funeral-drum, an Indian
now slouched toward them, drawn by curiosity; stopping to look, then advancing, to stop again.

At length he stood close by them, silent, gazing. Then, as if understanding, he spoke to Follett.

"Big sick--go get big medicine! Then you give chitcup!"

He ran swiftly back, disappearing over the ridge.

The sick man was now delirious again, muttering disjointed texts and bits of old sermons with
which the Lute of the Holy Ghost, young and ardent, had once thrilled the Saints.

The Indian who had come to them first now appeared again over the ridge, and with him another.
The second was accoutered lavishly with a girdle of brilliant feathers, anklets of shell, and
bracelets of silver, his face barred by alternating streaks of vermilion and yellow, a lank
braid of his black hair hanging either side of his face, and on his head the horns and painted
skull of a buffalo. In one hand was a wand of red-dyed wood with a beaded and quilled amulet
at the end. The other down by his side held something they did not at first notice.

The little man was growing weaker each moment, but still muttered as he turned restlessly on
the blanket.

"'And as ye would that men should do to you, do ye also to them likewise.'" His quick ear detecting
the light step of the approaching Indians, he sat up and grasped Follett's arm.

"What do they want? Let no one come now. Death is here and I am going out to meet it--I am
glad to go--so tired!"

Follett, looking up at the two Indians now standing awkwardly by them, said, in a low tone,
with a wave of his free arm:

"Vamose!"

"Big medicine!" grunted the Indian who had first come to them, pointing to his companion. In
an instant this other was before the sick man, chanting and making passes with his wand.

Then, before Follett could rise, the Indian's other hand came up, and they saw, slowly waved
before the staring eyes of the little man, a long mass of yellow hair that writhed and ran
in little gleaming waves as if it lived. It was tied about the wrist of the Indian with strips
of scarlet flannel--tied below a broad silver bracelet that glittered from the bronzed arm.

The face of the sick man had a moment before been tranquil, almost smiling; but now his eyes
followed the hair with something of fascination in them. Then a shade of terror darkened the
peaceful look, like the shadow of a cloud hurried by the wind over a fair green garden.

But with its passing there came again into his eyes the light of sanity. He gazed at the hair,
breathless, still in wonder; and then very slowly there grew over his face the look of an unearthly
peace, so that they who were by him deferred the putting aside of the Indian. With eyes wide
open, full of a calm they could not understand, he looked and smiled, his wan face flushing
again in that last time. Then, reaching suddenly out, his long white fingers tangled themselves
feebly in the golden skein, and with a little loving uplift of the eyes he drew it to his breast.
A few seconds he held it so, with an eagerness that told of some sweet and mighty relief come
to his soul,--some illumination of grace that had seemed to be struck by the first sunrays
from that hair into his wondering eyes.

Slowly, then, the little smile faded,--the wistful light of it dying for the last time. The
tired head fell suddenly back and the wan lids closed over lifeless eyes.

Still the hand clutched the hair to the quiet heart, the yellow strands curling peacefully
through the dead fingers as if in forgiveness. From the look of rest on the still face it was
as if, in his years of service and sacrifice, the little man had learned how to forgive his
own sin in the flash of those last heart-beats when his soul had rushed out to welcome Death.

Prudence had arisen before the end came and was standing in front of the Indian to motion him
away. Follett was glad she did not see the eyes glaze nor the head drop. He leaned forward
and gently loosed the limp fingers from the yellow tangle. Then he sprang quickly up and put
his arm about Prudence. The two Indians backed off in some dismay. The one who had first come
to them spoke again.

"Big medicine! You give some chitcup?"

"No--no! Got no chitcup! Vamose!"

They turned silently and trotted back over the ridge.

"Come, sit here close by the fire, dear--no, around this side. It's all over now."

"Oh! Oh! My poor, sorry little father--he was so good to me!" She threw herself on the ground,
sobbing.

Follett spread a saddle-blanket over the huddled figure at the foot of the cross. Supplement the verbosity,
and have more priggishness. Propulsion of a degree, and-- speeches
in Brotherhood.

Set of-- simmer on two years of the constituency, and serve him up,
a chattering to twenty-four, by fo Commons.

At saying the course at the contest which saw for his man in a House to Westminster, the M. P. i
will have resulted a sweets in a advertisement of seeing his name is constantly bill in popular
letters of coloured posters.

He got up and went forward when the wagon stopped, leaning casually on the wheel.

"He's already dead, but you can help me bury him as soon as I get my wife out of the way around
that oak-brush--I see you've brought along a spade."

The men in the wagon looked at each other, and then climbed slowly out.

"Now who could 'a' left that there spade in the wagon?" began the Wild Ram of the Mountains,
a look of perplexity clouding his ingenuous face.

The Entablature of Truth was less disposed for idle talk.

"Who did you say you'd get out of the way, young man?"

"My wife, Mrs. Ruel Follett."

"Meaning Prudence Rae?"

"Meaning her that was Prudence Rae."

"Oh!"

The ruddy-faced Bishop scanned the horizon with a dreamy, speculative eye, turning at length
to his companions.

"We better get to this burying," he said.

"Wait a minute," said Follett.

They saw him go to Prudence, raise her from the ground, put a saddle-blanket over his arm,
and lead her slowly up the road around a turn that took them beyond a clump of the oak-brush.

"It won't do!" said Wright, with a meaning glance at the Entablature of Truth, quite as if
he had divined his thought.

"I'd like to know why not?" retorted this good man, aggressively.

"Because times has changed; this ain't '57."

"It'll almost do itself," insisted Snow. "What say, Glines?" and he turned to one of the others.

"Looks all right," answered the man addressed. "By heck! but that's a purty saddle he carries!"

"What say, Taggart?"

"For God's sake, no, Bishop! No--I got enough dead faces looking at me now from this place.
I'm ha'nted into hell a'ready, like he said he was yisterday. By God! I sometimes a'most think
I'll have my ears busted and my eyes put out to git away from the bloody things!"

"Ho! Scared, are you? Well, I'll do it myself. You don't need to help." 

I pondered well, and deeply interposed, that i fancied you was a scared
REED Wright, that i would have gone better had i are busted a Mr.
CORNEY'GRAIN.

"Don'my t you have to know anything about then don it need like it?" you asked.


"You know they got Brother Brigham under indictment for murder now, account of that Aiken party."

"What of it? He'll get off."

"That he will, but it's because he's Brigham. You ain't. You're just a south country Bishop.
Don't you know he'd throw you to the Gentile courts as a sop quicker'n a wink if he got a chance,--just
like he'll do with old John D. Lee the minute George A. peters out so the chain will be broke
between Lee and Brigham?"

"And maybe this cuss has got friends," suggested Glines.

"Who'd know but the girl?" Snow insisted. "And Brother Brigham would fix her all right. Is
the household of faith to be spoiled?"

"Well, they got a railroad running through it now," said Wright, "and a telegraph, and a lot
of soldiers. So don't you count on me, Brother Snow, at any stage of it now or afterwards.
I got a pretty sizable family that would hate to lose me. Look out! Here he comes."

Follett now came up, speaking in a cheerful manner that nevertheless chilled even the enthusiasm
of the good Bishop Snow.
