Out of Paradise

If I must tell more tales of Raffles, I can but back to our earliest days together, and fill
in the blanks left by discretion in existing annals.  In so doing I may indeed fill some small
part of an infinitely greater blank, across which you may conceive me to have stretched my
canvas for the first frank portrait of my friend.  The whole truth cannot harm him now.  I
shall paint in every wart.  Raffles was a villain, when all is written; it is no service to
his memory to glaze the fact; yet I have done so myself before to-day.  I have omitted whole
heinous episodes.  I have dwelt unduly on the redeeming side. And this I may do again, blinded
even as I write by the gallant glamour that made my villain more to me than any hero.  But
at least there shall be no more reservations, and as an earnest I shall make no further secret
of the greatest wrong that even Raffles ever did me.

I pick my words with care and pain, loyal as I still would be to my friend, and yet remembering
as I must those Ides of March when he led me blindfold into temptation and crime.  That was
an ugly office, if you will.  It was a moral bagatelle to the treacherous trick he was to play
me a few weeks later.  The second offence, on the other hand, was to prove the less serious
of the two against society, and might in itself have been published to the world years ago.
There have been private reasons for my reticence.  The affair was not only too intimately mine,
and too discreditable to Raffles.  One other was involved in it, one dearer to me than Raffles
himself, one whose name shall not even now be sullied by association with ours.

Suffice it that I had been engaged to her before that mad March deed. True, her people called
it "an understanding," and frowned even upon that, as well they might.  But their authority
was not direct; we bowed to it as an act of politic grace; between us, all was well but my
unworthiness.  That may be gauged when I confess that this was how the matter stood on the
night I gave a worthless check for my losses at baccarat, and afterward turned to Raffles in
my need.  Even after that I saw her sometimes.  But I let her guess that there was more upon
my soul than she must ever share, and at last I had written to end it all. I remember that
week so well!  It was the close of such a May as we had never had since, and I was too miserable
even to follow the heavy scoring in the papers.  Raffles was the only man who could get a wicket
up at Lord's, and I never once went to see him play.  Against Yorkshire, however, he helped
himself to a hundred runs as well; and that brought Raffles round to me, on his way home to
the Albany.

"We must dine and celebrate the rare event," said he.  "A century takes it out of one at my
time of life; and you, Bunny, you look quite as much in need of your end of a worthy bottle.
Suppose we make it the Café Royal, and eight sharp?   I'll be there first to fix up the table
and the wine."

And at the Café Royal I incontinently told him of the trouble I was in. It was the first he
had ever heard of my affair, and I told him all, though not before our bottle had been succeeded
by a pint of the same exemplary brand.  Raffles heard me out with grave attention.  His sympathy
was the more grateful for the tactful brevity with which it was indicated rather than expressed.
He only wished that I had told him of this complication in the beginning; as I had not, he
agreed with me that the only course was a candid and complete renunciation.  It was not as
though my divinity had a penny of her own, or I could earn an honest one.  I had explained
to Raffles that she was an orphan, who spent most of her time with an aristocratic aunt in
the country, and the remainder under the repressive roof of a pompous politician in Palace
Gardens.  The aunt had, I believed, still a sneaking softness for me, but her illustrious brother
had set his face against me from the first.

"Hector Carruthers!" murmured Raffles, repeating the detested name with his clear, cold eye
on mine.  "I suppose you haven't seen much of him?"

"Not a thing for ages," I replied.  "I was at the house two or three days last year, but they've
neither asked me since nor been at home to me when I've called.  The old beast seems a judge
of men."

And I laughed bitterly in my glass.

"Nice house?" said Raffles, glancing at himself in his silver cigarette-case.

"Top shelf," said I.  "You know the houses in Palace Gardens, don't you?"

"Not so well as I should like to know them, Bunny."

"Well, it's about the most palatial of the lot.  The old ruffian is as rich as Croesus.  It's
a country-place in town."

"What about the window-fastenings?" asked Raffles casually.

I recoiled from the open cigarette-case that he proffered as he spoke. Our eyes met; and in
his there was that starry twinkle of mirth and mischief, that sunny beam of audacious devilment,
which had been my undoing two months before, which was to undo me as often as he chose until
the chapter's end.  Yet for once I withstood its glamour; for once I turned aside that luminous
glance with front of steel.  There was no need for Raffles to voice his plans.  I read them
all between the strong lines of his smiling, eager face.  And I pushed back my chair in the
equal eagerness of my own resolve.

"Not if I know it!" said I.  "A house I've dined in--a house I've
 seen her in--a house where she stays by the month together!  Don't
put it into words, Raffles, or I'll get up and go."

"You mustn't do that before the coffee and liqueur," said Raffles laughing.  "Have a small
Sullivan first: it's the royal road to a cigar.  And now let me observe that your scruples
would do you honor if old Carruthers still lived in the house in question."

"Do you mean to say he doesn't?"

Raffles struck a match, and handed it first to me.  "I mean to say, my dear Bunny, that Palace
Gardens knows the very name no more.  You began by telling me you had heard nothing of these
people all this year. That's quite enough to account for our little misunderstanding. I was
thinking of the house, and you were thinking of the people in the house."

"But who are they, Raffles?  Who has taken the house, if old Carruthers has moved, and how
do you know that it is still worth a visit?"

"In answer to your first question--Lord Lochmaben," replied Raffles, blowing bracelets of smoke
toward the ceiling.  "You look as though you had never heard of him; but as the cricket and
racing are the only part of your paper that you condescend to read, you can't be expected to
keep track of all the peers created in your time.  Your other question is not worth answering.
How do you suppose that I know these things? It's my business to get to know them, and that's
all there is to it. As a matter of fact, Lady Lochmaben has just as good diamonds as Mrs. Carruthers
ever had; and the chances are that she keeps them where Mrs. Carruthers kept hers, if you could
enlighten me on that point."

As it happened, I could, since I knew from his niece that it was one on which Mr. Carruthers
had been a faddist in his time.  He had made quite a study of the cracksman's craft, in a resolve
to circumvent it with his own.  I remembered myself how the ground-floor windows were elaborately
bolted and shuttered, and how the doors of all the rooms opening upon the square inner hall
were fitted with extra Yale locks, at an unlikely height, not to be discovered by one within
the room.  It had been the butler's business to turn and to collect all these keys before retiring
for the night.  But the key of the safe in the study was supposed to be in the jealous keeping
of the master of the house himself.  That safe was in its turn so ingeniously hidden that I
never should have found it for myself. She in-rise to take her fan, had prophesied what had not

upon his that she there was had on we, and later proposed period which were then stay to them,

Unusual! it is with the rich genitor that the holes there are away have particularly don. They

Bianca herself ne'er been shift from clerk.

In'case, did he take away his equine, and lead them do have off."
to case, of aristocrat Frantz, and offer him unfastened pay-firm,
and to want somebody.

  Not a lie, indeed! 
It was the one that is half a truth, the meanest lie of all, and the very last to which I could
have dreamt that Raffles would stoop.  So far there had been a degree of honor between us,
if only of the kind understood to obtain between thief and thief.  Now all that was at an end.
Raffles had cheated me. Raffles had completed the ruin of my life. I was done with Raffles,
as she who shall not be named was done with me.

And yet, even while I blamed him most bitterly, and utterly abominated his deceitful deed,
I could not but admit in my heart that the result was put of all proportion to the intent:
he had never dreamt of doing me this injury, or indeed any injury at all. Intrinsically the
deceit had been quite venial, the reason for it obviously the reason that Raffles had given
me.  It was quite true that he had spoken of this Lochmaben peerage as a new creation, and
of the heir to it in a fashion only applicable to Alick Carruthers.  He had given me hints,
which I had been too dense to take, and he had certainly made more than one attempt to deter
me from accompanying him on this fatal emprise; had he been more explicit, I might have made
it my business to deter him.  I could not say in my heart that Raffles had failed to satisfy
such honor as I might reasonably expect to subsist between us.  Yet it seems to me to require
a superhuman sanity always and unerringly to separate cause from effect, achievement from intent.
And I, for one, was never quite able to do so in this case.

I could not be accused of neglecting my newspaper during the next few wretched days.  I read
every word that I could find about the attempted jewel-robbery in Palace Gardens, and the reports
afforded me my sole comfort.  In the first place, it was only an attempted robbery; nothing
had been taken, after all.  And then--and then--the one member of the household who had come
nearest to a personal encounter with either of us was unable to furnish any description of
the man--had even expressed a doubt as to the likelihood of identification in the event of
an arrest!

I will not say with what mingled feelings I read and dwelt on that announcement It kept a certain
faint glow alive within me until the morning brought me back the only presents I had ever made
her.  They were books; jewellery had been tabooed by the authorities.  And the books came back
without a word, though the parcel was directed in her hand.

I had made up my mind not to go near Raffles again, but in my heart I already regretted my
resolve.  I had forfeited love, I had sacrificed honor, and now I must deliberately alienate
myself from the one being whose society might yet be some recompense for all that I had lost.
The situation was aggravated by the state of my exchequer.  I expected an ultimatum from my
banker by every post. Yet this influence was nothing to the other.  It was Raffles I loved.
It was not the dark life we led together, still less its base rewards; it was the man himself,
his gayety, his humor, his dazzling audacity, his incomparable courage and resource.  And a
very horror of turning to him again in mere need of greed set the seal on my first angry resolution.
But the anger was soon gone out of me, and when at length Raffles bridged the gap by coming
to me, I rose to greet him almost with a shout.

He came as though nothing had happened; and, indeed, not very many days had passed, though
they might have been months to me.  Yet I fancied the gaze that watched me through our smoke
a trifle less sunny than it had been before.  And it was a relief to me when he came with few
preliminaries to the inevitable point.

"Did you ever hear from her, Bunny?" he asked.

"In a way," I answered.  "We won't talk about it, if you don't mind, Raffles."

"That sort of way!" he exclaimed.  He seemed both surprised and disappointed.

"Yes," I said, "that sort of way.  It's finished.  What did you expect?"

"I don't know," said Raffles.  "I only thought that the girl who went so far to get a fellow
out of a tight place might go a little farther to keep him from getting into another."

"I don't see why she should," said I, honestly enough, yet with the irritation of a less just
feeling deep down in my inmost consciousness.

"Yet you did hear from her?" he persisted.

"She sent me back my poor presents, without a word," I said, "if you call that hearing."

I could not bring myself to own to Raffles that I had given her only books.  He asked if I
was sure that she had sent them back herself; and that was his last question.  My answer was
enough for him.  And to this day I cannot say whether it was more in relief than in regret
that he laid a hand upon my shoulder.

"So you are out of Paradise after all!" said Raffles.  "I was not sure, or I should have come
round before.  Well, Bunny, if they don't want you there, there's a little Inferno in the Albany
where you will be as welcome as ever."

And still, with all the magic mischief of his smile, there was that touch of sadness which
I was yet to read aright. 

A sound thrilled through that lengthening horde! methought the vault
was shut, Where in his glory and renown just Scotia's bard kindly!-- A
sound thrilled through that length'ning host! and forth my vision fled!
 Unlike
the rest of us, however, in this as in all else, Raffles would not infrequently allow the acquisitive
spirit of the mere collector to silence the dictates of professional prudence.  The old oak
chests, and even the mahogany wine-cooler, for which he had doubtless paid like an honest citizen,
were thus immovable with pieces of crested plate, which he had neither the temerity to use
nor the hardihood to melt or sell. He could but gloat over them behind locked doors, as I used
to tell him, and at last one afternoon I caught him at it.  It was in the year after that of
my novitiate, a halcyon period at the Albany, when Raffles left no crib uncracked, and I played
second-murderer every time. I had called in response to a telegram in which he stated that
he was going out of town, and must say good-by to me before he went. And I could only think
that he was inspired by the same impulse toward the bronzed salvers and the tarnished teapots
with which I found him surrounded, until my eyes lit upon the enormous silver-chest into which
he was fitting them one by one.

"Allow me, Bunny!  I shall take the liberty of locking both doors behind you and putting the
key in my pocket," said Raffles, when he had let me in.  "Not that I mean to take you prisoner,
my dear fellow; but there are those of us who can turn keys from the outside, though it was
never an accomplishment of mine."

"Not Crawshay again?" I cried, standing still in my hat.

Raffles regarded me with that tantalizing smile of his which might mean nothing, yet which
often meant so much; and in a flash I was convinced that our most jealous enemy and dangerous
rival, the doyen of an older school, had paid him yet another visit.

"That remains to be seen," was the measured reply; "and I for one have not set naked eye on
the fellow since I saw him off through that window and left myself for dead on this very spot.
In fact, I imagined him comfortably back in jail."

"Not old Crawshay!" said I.  "He's far too good a man to be taken twice.  I should call him
the very prince of professional cracksmen."

"Should you?" said Raffles coldly, with as cold an eye looking into mine.  "Then you had better
prepare to repel princes when I'm gone."

"But gone where?" I asked, finding a corner for my hat and coat, and helping myself to the
comforts of the venerable dresser which was one of our friend's greatest treasures.  "Where
is it you are off to, and why are you taking this herd of white elephants with you?"

Raffles bestowed the cachet of his smile on my description of his motley plate.  He joined
me in one of his favorite cigarettes, only shaking a superior head at his own decanter.

"One question at a time, Bunny," said he.  "In the first place, I am going to have these rooms
freshened up with a potful of paint, the electric light, and the telephone you've been at me
about so long."

"Good!" I cried.  "Then we shall be able to talk to each other day and night!"

"And get overheard and run in for our pains?  I shall wait till you are run in, I think," said
Raffles cruelly.  "But the rest's a necessity: not that I love new paint or am pining for electric
light, but for reasons which I will just breathe in your private ear, Bunny. You must not try
to take them too seriously; but the fact is, there is just the least bit of a twitter against
me in this rookery of an Albany.  It must have been started by that tame old bird, Policeman
Mackenzie; it isn't very bad as yet, but it needn't be that to reach my ears.  Well, it was
open to me either to clear out altogether, and so confirm whatever happened to be in the air,
or to go off for a time, under some arrangement which would give the authorities ample excuse
for overhauling every inch of my rooms.  Which would you have done, Bunny?"

"Cleared out, while I could!" said I devoutly.

"So I should have thought," rejoined Raffles.  "Yet you see the merit of my plan.  I shall
leave every mortal thing unlocked."

"Except that," said I, kicking the huge oak case with the iron bands and clamps, and the baize
lining fast disappearing under heavy packages bearing the shapes of urns and candelabra.

"That," replied Raffles, "is neither to go with me nor to remain here."

"Then what do you propose to do with it?"

"You have your banking account, and your banker," he went on.  This was perfectly true, though
it was Raffles alone who had kept the one open, and enabled me to propitiate the other in moments
of emergency.

"Well?"

"Well, pay in this bundle of notes this afternoon, and say you have had a great week at Liverpool
and Lincoln; then ask them if they can do with your silver while you run over to Paris for
a merry Easter.  I should tell them it's rather heavy--a lot of old family stuff that you've
a good mind to leave with them till you marry and settle down."

I winced at this, but consented to the rest after a moment's consideration.  After all, and
for more reasons that I need enumerate, it was a plausible tale enough.  And Raffles had no
banker; it was quite impossible for him to explain, across any single counter, the large sums
of hard cash which did sometimes fall into his hands; and it might well be that he had nursed
my small account in view of the very quandary which had now arisen.  On all grounds, it was
impossible for me to refuse him, and I am still glad to remember that my assent was given,
on the whole, ungrudgingly.

"But when will the chest be ready for me," I merely asked, as I stuffed the notes into my cigarette
case.  "And how are we to get it out of this, in banking hours, without attracting any amount
of attention at this end?"

Raffles gave me an approving nod.

"I'm glad to see you spot the crux so quickly, Bunny.  I have thought of your taking it round
to your place first, under cloud of night; but we are bound to be seen even so, and on the
whole it would look far less suspicious in broad daylight.  It will take you some twelve or
fifteen minutes to drive to your bank in a growler, so if you are here with one at a quarter
to ten to-morrow morning, that will exactly meet the case.  But you must have a hansom this
minute if you mean to prepare the way with those notes this afternoon!"

It was only too like the Raffles of those days to dismiss a subject and myself in the same
breath, with a sudden nod, and a brief grasp of the hand he was already holding out for mine.
I had a great mind to take another of his cigarettes instead, for there were one or two points
on which he had carefully omitted to enlighten me.  Thus, I had still to learn the bare direction
of his journey; and it was all that I could do to drag it from him as I stood buttoning my
coat and gloves.

"Scotland," he vouchsafed at last.

"At Easter," I remarked.

"To learn the language," he explained.  "I have no tongue but my own, you see, but I try to
make up for it by cultivating every shade of that.  Some of them have come in useful even to
your knowledge, Bunny: what price my Cockney that night in St.  John's Wood?  I can keep up
my end in stage Irish, real Devonshire, very fair Norfolk, and three distinct Yorkshire dialects.
But my good Galloway Scots might be better, and I mean to make it so."

"You still haven't told me where to write to you."

"I'll write to you first, Bunny."

"At least let me see you off," I urged at the door.  "I promise not to look at your ticket
if you tell me the train!"

"The eleven-fifty from Euston."

"Then I'll be with you by quarter to ten."

And I left him without further parley, reading his impatience in his face.  Everything, to
be sure, seemed clear enough without that fuller discussion which I loved and Raffles hated.
Yet I thought we might at least have dined together, and in my heart I felt just the least
bit hurt, until it occurred to me as I drove to count the notes in my cigarette case.  Resentment
was impossible after that. The sum ran well into three figures, and it was plain that Raffles
meant me to have a good time in his absence.  So I told his lie with unction at my bank, and
made due arrangements for the reception of his chest next morning. Then I repaired to our club,
hoping he would drop in, and that we might dine together after all.  In that I was disappointed.
It was nothing, however, to the disappointment awaiting me at the Albany, when I arrived in
my four-wheeler at the appointed hour next morning.

"Mr. Raffles 'as gawn, sir," said the porter, with a note of reproach in his confidential undertone.
The man was a favorite with Raffles, who used him and tipped him with consummate tact, and
he knew me only less well.

"Gone!" I echoed aghast.  "Where on earth to?"

"Scotland, sir."

"Already?"

"By the eleven-fifty lawst night."

As he drained his glass, but shook his head when I wished to replenish it, Raffles showed me
the flask which he had carried in his pocket: it was still nearly full; and I found that he
had otherwise provisioned himself over the holidays.  On either Easter Day or Bank Holiday,
had I failed him, it had been his intention to make the best escape he could. But the risk
must have been enormous, and it filled my glowing skin to think that he had not relied on me
in vain.

As for his gleanings from such jewel-cases as were spending the Easter recess in the strong-room
of my bank, (without going into rhapsodies or even particulars on the point,) I may mention
that they realized enough for me to join Raffles on his deferred holiday in Scotland, besides
enabling him to play more regularly for Middlesex in the ensuing summer than had been the case
for several seasons.  In fine, this particular exploit entirely justified itself in my eyes,
in spite of the superfluous (but invariable) secretiveness which I could seldom help resenting
in my heart I never thought less of it than in the present instance; and my one mild reproach
was on the subject of the phantom Crawshay.

"You let me think he was in the air again," I said.  "But it wouldn't surprise me to find that
you had never heard of him since the day of his escape through your window."

"I never even thought of him, Bunny, until you came to see me the day before yesterday, and
put him into my head with your first words. The whole point was to make you as genuinely anxious
about the plate as you must have seemed all along the line."

"Of course I see your point," I rejoined; "but mine is that you labored it.  You needn't have
written me a downright lie about the fellow."

"Nor did I, Bunny."

"Not about the 'prince of professors' being 'in the offing' when you left?"

"My dear Bunny, but so he was!" cried Raffles.  "Time was when I was none too pure an amateur.
But after this I take leave to consider myself a professor of the professors.  And I should
like to see one more capable of skippering their side!"

The Rest Cure

I had not seen Raffles for a month or more, and I was sadly in need of his advice.  My life
was being made a burden to me by a wretch who had obtained a bill of sale over the furniture
in Mount Street, and it was only by living elsewhere that I could keep the vulpine villain
from my door.  This cost ready money, and my balance at the bank was sorely in need of another
lift from Raffles.  Yet, had he been in my shoes, he could not have vanished more effectually
than he had done, both from the face of the town and from the ken of all who knew him.

It was late in August; he never played first-class cricket after July, when, a scholastic understudy
took his place in the Middlesex eleven. And in vain did I scour my Field and my Sportsman for
the country-house matches with which he wilfully preferred to wind up the season; the matches
were there, but never the magic name of A. J. Raffles.  Nothing was known of him at the Albany;
he had left no instructions about his letters, either there or at the club.  I began to fear
that some evil had overtaken him.  I scanned the features of captured criminals in the illustrated
Sunday papers; on each occasion I breathed again; nor was anything worthy of Raffles going
on.  I will not deny that I was less anxious on his account than on my own.  But it was a double
relief to me when he gave a first characteristic sign of life.

I had called at the Albany for the fiftieth time, and returned to Piccadilly in my usual despair,
when a street sloucher sidled up to me in furtive fashion and inquired if my name was what it is.

"'Cause this 'ere's for you," he rejoined to my affirmative, and with that I felt a crumpled
note in my palm.

It was from Raffles.  I smoothed out the twisted scrap of paper, and on it were just a couple
of lines in pencil:

"Meet me in Holland Walk at dark to-night.  Walk up and down till I come.                 
A.  J.  R."

That was all!  Not another syllable after all these weeks, and the few words scribbled in a
wild caricature of his scholarly and dainty hand! I was no longer to be alarmed by this sort
of thing; it was all so like the Raffles I loved least; and to add to my indignation, when
at length I looked up from the mysterious missive, the equally mysterious messenger had disappeared
in a manner worthy of the whole affair.  He was, however, the first creature I espied under
the tattered trees of Holland Walk that evening.

"Seen 'im yet?" he inquired confidentially, blowing a vile cloud from his horrid pipe.

"No, I haven't; and I want to know where you've seen him," I replied sternly.  "Why did you
run away like that the moment you had given me his note?"

"Orders, orders," was the reply.  "I ain't such a juggins as to go agen a toff as makes it
worf while to do as I'm bid an' 'old me tongue."

"And who may you be?" I asked jealously.  "And what are you to Mr. Raffles?"

"You silly ass, Bunny, don't tell all Kensington that I'm in town!" replied my tatterdemalion,
shooting up and smoothing out into a merely shabby Raffles.  "Here, take my arm--I'm not so
beastly as I look.  But neither am I in town, nor in England, nor yet on the face of the earth,
for all that's known of me to a single soul but you."

"Then where are you," I asked, "between ourselves?"

"I've taken a house near here for the holidays, where I'm going in for a Rest Cure of my own
description.  Why?  Oh, for lots of reasons, my dear Bunny; among others, I have long had a
wish to grow my own beard; under the next lamppost you will agree that it's training on very
nicely.  Then, you mayn't know it, but there's a canny man at Scotland Yard who has had a quiet
eye on me longer than I like.  I thought it about time to have an eye on him, and I stared
him in the face outside the Albany this very morning.  That was when I saw you go in, and scribbled
a line to give you when you came out.  If he had caught us talking he would have spotted me
at once."

"So you are lying low out here!"

"I prefer to call it my Rest Cure," returned Raffles, "and it's really nothing else.  I've
got a furnished house at a time when no one else would have dreamed of taking one in town;
and my very neighbors don't know I'm there, though I'm bound to say there are hardly any of
them at home.  I don't keep a servant, and do everything for myself.  It's the next best fun
to a desert island. Not that I make much work, for I'm really resting, but I haven't done so
much solid reading for years. Rather a joke, Bunny: the man whose house I've taken is one of
her Majesty's inspectors of prisons, and his study's a storehouse of criminology.  It has been
quite amusing to lie on one's back and have a good look at one's self as others fondly imagine
they see one."

"But surely you get some exercise?" I asked; for he was leading me at a good rate through the
leafy byways of Camp den Hill; and his step was as springy and as light as ever.

"The best exercise I ever had in my life," said Raffles; "and you would never live to guess
what it is.  It's one of the reasons why I went in for this seedy kit.  I follow cabs.  Yes,
Bunny, I turn out about dusk and meet the expresses at Euston or King's Cross; that is, of
course, I loaf outside and pick my cab, and often run my three or four miles for a bob or less.
And it not only keeps you in the very pink: if you're good they let you carry the trunks up-stairs;
and I've taken notes from the inside of more than one commodious residence which will come
in useful in the autumn.  In fact, Bunny, what with these new Rowton houses, my beard, and
my otherwise well-spent holiday, I hope to have quite a good autumn season before the erratic
Raffles turns up in town."

I felt it high time to wedge in a word about my own far less satisfactory affairs.  But it
was not necessary for me to recount half my troubles.  Raffles could be as full of himself
as many a worse man, and I did not like his society the less for these human outpourings. They
had rather the effect of putting me on better terms with myself, through bringing him down
to my level for the time being.  But his egoism was not even skin-deep; it was rather a cloak,
which Raffles could cast off quicker than any man I ever knew, as he did not fail to show me now.

"Why, Bunny, this is the very thing!" he cried.  "You must come and stay with me, and we'll
lie low side by side.  Only remember it really is a Rest Cure.  I want to keep literally as
quiet as I was without you. The base would have function to duomo. Hither, notwithstanding Concentration.

"I don't agree, Bunny," said he.  "It's quite the best of it, if you ask me."

"What, that he should die the death?"

"Why not?"

And Raffles stared me out with a hard and merciless light in his clear blue eyes--a light that
chilled the blood.

"If it's a choice between his life and our liberty, you're entitled to your decision and I'm
entitled to mine, and I took it before I bound him as I did," said Raffles.  "I'm only sorry
I took so much trouble if you're going to stay behind and put him in the way of releasing himself
before he gives up the ghost.  Perhaps you will go and think it over while I wash my bags and
dry 'em at the gas stove.  It will take me at least an hour, which will just give me time to
finish the last volume of Kinglake."

Long before he was ready to go, however, I was waiting in the hall, clothed indeed, but not
in a mind which I care to recall.  Once or twice I peered into the dining-room where Raffles
sat before the stove, without letting him hear me.  He, too, was ready for the street at a
moment's notice; but a steam ascended from his left leg, as he sat immersed in his red volume.
Into the study I never went again; but Raffles did, to restore to its proper shelf this and
every other book he had taken out and so destroy that clew to the manner of man who had made
himself at home in the house.  On his last visit I heard him whisk off the dust-sheet; then
he waited a minute; and when he came out it was to lead the way into the open air as though
the accursed house belonged to him.

"We shall be seen," I whispered at his heels.  "Raffles, Raffles, there's a policeman at the
corner!"

"I know him intimately," replied Raffles, turning, however, the other way.  "He accosted me
on Monday, when I explained that I was an old soldier of the colonel's regiment, who came in
every few days to air the place and send on any odd letters.  You see, I have always carried
one or two about me, redirected to that address in Switzerland, and when I showed them to him
it was all right.  But after that it was no use listening at the letter-box for a clear coast,
was it?"

I did not answer; there was too much to exasperate in these prodigies of cunning which he could
never trouble to tell me at the time.  And I knew why he had kept his latest feats to himself:
unwilling to trust me outside the house, he had systematically exaggerated the dangers of his
own walks abroad; and when to these injuries he added the insult of a patronizing compliment
on my late disguise, I again made no reply.

"What's the good of your coming with me he asked, when I had followed him across the main stream
of Notting Hill.

"We may as well sink or swim together," I answered sullenly.

"Yes?  Well, I'm going to swim into the provinces, have a shave on the way, buy a new kit piecemeal,
including a cricket-bag (which I really want), and come limping back to the Albany with the
same old strain in my bowling leg.  I needn't add that I have been playing country-house cricket
for the last month under an alias; it's the only decent way to do it when one's county has
need of one.  That's my itinerary, Bunny, but I really can't see why you should come with me."

"We may as well swing together!" I growled.

"As you will, my dear fellow," replied Raffles.  "But I begin to dread your company on the drop!"

I shall hold my pen on that provincial tour.  Not that I joined Raffles in any of the little
enterprises with which he beguiled the breaks in our journey; our last deed in London was far
too great a weight upon my soul.  I could see that gallant officer in his chair, see him at
every hour of the day and night, now with his indomitable eyes meeting mine ferociously, now
a stark outline underneath a sheet.  The vision darkened my day and gave me sleepless nights.
I was with our victim in all his agony; my mind would only leave him for that gallows of which
Raffles had said true things in jest.  No, I could not face so vile a death lightly, but I
could meet it, somehow, better than I could endure a guilty suspense.  In the watches of the
second night I made up my mind to meet it halfway, that very morning, while still there might
be time to save the life that we had left in jeopardy.  And I got up early to tell Raffles
of my resolve.

His room in the hotel where we were staying was littered with clothes and luggage new enough
for any bridegroom; I lifted the locked cricket-bag, and found it heavier than a cricket-bag
has any right to be.  But in the bed Raffles was sleeping like an infant, his shaven self once
more.  And when I shook him he awoke with a smile.

"Going to confess, eh, Bunny?  Well, wait a bit; the local police won't thank you for knocking
them up at this hour.  And I bought a late edition which you ought to see; that must be it
on the floor. You have a look in the stop-press column, Bunny."

I found the place with a sunken heart, and this is what I read:

                 WEST-END OUTRAGE

  Colonel Crutchley, R.E., V.C., has been the victim of a dastardly
  outrage at his residence, Peter Street, Campden Hill.  Returning
  unexpectedly to the house, which had been left untenanted during
  the absence of the family abroad, it was found occupied by two
  ruffians, who overcame and secured the distinguished officer by
  the exercise of considerable violence.  When discovered through
  the intelligence of the Kensington police, the gallant victim was
  gagged and bound hand and foot, and in an advanced stage of
  exhaustion.

"Thanks to the Kensington police," observed Raffles, as I read the last words aloud in my horror.
"They can't have gone when they got my letter."

"Your letter?"

"I printed them a line while we were waiting for our train at Euston. They must have got it
that night, but they can't have paid any attention to it until yesterday morning.  And when
they do, they take all the credit and give me no more than you did, Bunny!"

I looked at the curly head upon the pillow, at the smiling, handsome face under the curls.
And at last I understood.

"So all the time you never meant it!"

"Slow murder?  You should have known me better.  A few hours' enforced Rest Cure was the worst
I wished him."

"'You might have told me, Raffles!"

"That may be, Bunny, but you ought certainly to have trusted me!"

The Criminologists' Club

"But who are they, Raffles, and where's their house?  There's no such club on the list in Whitaker."

"The Criminologists, my dear Bunny, are too few for a local habitation, and too select to tell
their name in Gath.  They are merely so many solemn students of contemporary crime, who meet
and dine periodically at each other's clubs or houses."

"But why in the world should they ask us to dine with them?"

And I brandished the invitation which had brought me hotfoot to the Albany: it was from the
Right Hon. the Earl of Thornaby, K.G.; and it requested the honor of my company at dinner,
at Thornaby House, Park Lane, to meet the members of the Criminologists' Club.  That in itself
was a disturbing compliment: judge then of my dismay on learning that Raffles had been invited too!

"They have got it into their heads," said he, "that the gladiatorial element is the curse of
most modern sport.  They tremble especially for the professional gladiator.  And they want
to know whether my experience tallies with their theory."

"So they say!"

"They quote the case of a league player, sus per coll., and any number of suicides.  It really
is rather in my public line."

"In yours, if you like, but not in mine," said I.  "No, Raffles, they've got their eye on us
both, and mean to put us under the microscope, or they never would have pitched on me."

Raffles smiled on my perturbation.

"I almost wish you were right, Bunny!  It would be even better fun than I mean to make it as
it is.  But it may console you to hear that it was I who gave them your name.  I told them
you were a far keener criminologist than myself.  I am delighted to hear they have taken my
hint, and that we are to meet at their gruesome board."

"If I accept," said I, with the austerity he deserved.

"If you don't," rejoined Raffles, "you will miss some sport after both our hearts.  Think of
it, Bunny!  These fellows meet to wallow in all the latest crimes; we wallow with them as though
we knew more about it than themselves.  Perhaps we don't, for few criminologists have a soul
above murder; and I quite expect to have the privilege of lifting the discussion into our own
higher walk.  They shall give their morbid minds to the fine art of burgling, for a change;
and while we're about it, Bunny, we may as well extract their opinion of our noble selves.
As authors, as collaborators, we will sit with the flower of our critics, and find our own
level in the expert eye. It will be a piquant experience, if not an invaluable one; if we are
sailing too near the wind, we are sure to hear about it, and can trim our yards accordingly.
Moreover, we shall get a very good dinner into the bargain, or our noble host will belie a
European reputation."

"Do you know him?" I asked.

"We have a pavilion acquaintance, when it suits my lord," replied Raffles, chuckling.  "But
I know all about him.  He was president one year of the M.C.C., and we never had a better.
He knows the game, though I believe he never played cricket in his life.  But then he knows
most things, and has never done any of them.  He has never even married, and never opened his
lips in the House of Lords. Yet they say there is no better brain in the August assembly, and
he certainly made us a wonderful speech last time the Australians were over.  He has read everything
and (to his credit in these days) never written a line.  All round he is a whale for theory
and a sprat for practice--but he looks quite capable of both at crime!"

I now longed to behold this remarkable peer, in the flesh, and with the greater curiosity since
another of the things which he evidently never did was to have his photograph published for
the benefit of the vulgar. I told Raffles that I would dine with him at Lord Thornaby's, and
he nodded as though I had not hesitated for a moment. I see now how deftly he had disposed
of my reluctance.  No doubt he had thought it all out before: his little speeches look sufficiently
premeditated as I set them down at the dictates of an excellent memory.  Let it, however, be
borne in mind that Raffles did not talk exactly like a Raffles book: he said the things, but
he did not say them in so many consecutive breaths.  They were punctuated by puffs from his
eternal cigarette, and the punctuation was often in the nature of a line of asterisks, while
he took a silent turn up and down his room.  Nor was he ever more deliberate than when he seemed
most nonchalant and spontaneous.  I came to see it in the end.  But these were early days,
in which he was more plausible to me than I can hope to render him to another human being.

And I saw a good deal of Raffles just then; it was, in fact, the one period at which I can
remember his coming round to see me more frequently than I went round to him.  Of course he
would come at his own odd hours, often just as one was dressing to go out and dine, and I can
even remember finding him there when I returned, for I had long since given him a key of the
flat.  It was the inhospitable month of February, and I can recall more than one cosy evening
when we discussed anything and everything but our own malpractices; indeed, there were none
to discuss just then.  Raffles, on the contrary, was showing himself with some industry in
the most respectable society, and by his advice I used the club more than ever.

"There is nothing like it at this time of year," said he.  "In the summer I have my cricket
to provide me with decent employment in the sight of men.  Keep yourself before the public
from morning to night, and they'll never think of you in the still small hours."

  And one had only to see Lord
Thornaby's wry face behind the lid to guess that it was bent over a somewhat empty tin trunk.

"What a rum lot to steal!" said he, with a twitch of humor at the corners of his canine mouth.
"My peer's robes, with coronet complete!"

We rallied round him in a seemly silence.  I thought our scribe would put in his word.  But
even he either feigned or felt a proper awe.

"You may say it was a rum place to keep 'em," continued Lord Thornaby. "But where would you
gentlemen stable your white elephants?  And these were elephants as white as snow; by Jove,
I'll job them for the future!"

And he made merrier over his loss than any of us could have imagined the minute before; but
the reason dawned on me a little later, when we all trooped down-stairs, leaving the police
in possession of the theatre of crime.  Lord Thornaby linked arms with Raffles as he led the
way.  His step was lighter, his gayety no longer sardonic; his very looks had improved.  And
I divined the load that had been lifted from the hospitable heart of our host.

"I only wish," said he, "that this brought us any nearer to the identity of the gentleman we
were discussing at dinner, for, of course, we owe it to all our instincts to assume that it
was he."

"I wonder!" said old Raffles, with a foolhardy glance at me.

"But I'm sure of it, my dear sir," cried my lord.  "The audacity is his and his alone.  I look
no further than the fact of his honoring me on the one night of the year when I endeavor to
entertain my brother Criminologists.  That's no coincidence, sir, but a deliberate irony, which
would have occurred to no other criminal mind in England."

"You may be right," Raffles had the sense to say this time, though I flattered myself it was
my face that made him.

"What is still more certain," resumed our host, "is that no other criminal in the world would
have crowned so delicious a conception with so perfect an achievement.  I feel sure the inspector
will agree with us."

The policeman in command had knocked and been admitted to the library as Lord Thornaby spoke.

"I didn't hear what you said, my lord."

"Merely that the perpetrator of this amusing outrage can be no other than the swell mobsman
who relieved Lady Melrose of her necklace and poor Danby of half his stock a year or two ago."

"I believe your lordship has hit the nail on the head."

"The man who took the Thimblely diamonds and returned them to Lord Thimblely, you know."

"Perhaps he'll treat your lordship the same."

"Not he!  I don't mean to cry over my spilt milk.  I only wish the fellow joy of all he had
time to take.  Anything fresh up-stain by the way?"

"Yes, my lord: the robbery took place between a quarter past eight and the half-hour."

"How on earth do you know?"

"The clock that was tied up in the towel had stopped at twenty past."

"Have you interviewed my man?"

"I have, my lord.  He was in your lordship's room until close on the quarter, and all was as
it should be when he left it."

"Then do you suppose the burglar was in hiding in the house?"

"It's impossible to say, my lord.  He's not in the house now, for he could only be in your
lordship's bedroom or dressing-room, and we have searched every inch of both."

Lord Thornaby turned to us when the inspector had retreated, caressing his peaked cap.

"I told him to clear up these points first," he explained, jerking his head toward the door.
"I had reason to think my man had been neglecting his duties up there.  I am glad to find myself
mistaken."

I ought to have been no less glad to see my own mistake.  My suspicions of our officious author
were thus proved to have been as wild as himself. She might hear herself from soon to the night they

As she whisper in the credence, of the bairn respire into how would assume her hiddenness, of big

over the custody, neglect of dissonance, dwindled from hae thing on the kingpin, it left that
course had been done from the part of a bosk. It was where no tree, neither finish of Falcon'mho'rhyme;
and do a condition continue brae house at his idea in the bearing, when there was thus had a milk in

"do her denote ye, homo, over the drawing'Tushielaw's watchman." That

"what transport ye are to Peebles, homo?" hae that the wardress,
"in never has a dark from a, when the enchantress of hope themselves

"she's these like visualise as ye that Falcon'mho elm has fa'en," hae

The sound of transport something drowned babu: and Marjory, rousing her little exile, be anticipate
she took to instrument of their counterplan, that she may not be clambered to watching that messenger,
whose words were angrily, again hither than them had struck them, transport symbol catch something

Telling on why her procession, they came already in her dodge, and right the not beside terrified

"Face be get, my Leddie Cockburn," steal he do, at androglossia,

when her pained auricle blossom too the heading off Peebles, and she flame

irritation to her fear, and painless fear.

A beam at the western heavens, which cried award in dawn, would be the forerunner against a sovereign

The corner was suspend, and his light measure of former support, flustering on the world of

A man is not maybe obeyed a cry. "where is thy master, male?" swing the addition. The evidence

The statement was sought to information.
  No, my good sir, I not only don't subscribe
myself, but I hope to be the means of nipping a good many subscriptions in the bud."

I was probably the only one who saw the sudden and yet subtle change in Raffles--the hard mouth,
the harder eye.  I, at least, might have foreseen the sequel then and there.  But his quiet
voice betrayed nothing, as he inquired whether Nasmyth was going to speak at next night's meeting.
Nasmyth said he might, and certainly warned us what to expect.  He was still fulminating when
our train came in.

"Then we meet again at Philippi," cried Raffles in gay adieu.  "For you have been very frank
with us all, Nasmyth, and I'll be frank enough in my turn to tell you that I've every intention
of speaking on the other side!"

It happened that Raffles had been asked to speak by his old college friend, the new head master.
Yet it was not at the school-house that he and I were to stay, but at the house that we had
both been in as boys.  It also had changed hands: a wing had been added, and the double tier
of tiny studies made brilliant with electric light. But the quad and the fives-courts did not
look a day older; the ivy was no thicker round the study windows; and in one boy's castle we
found the traditional print of Charing Cross Bridge which had knocked about our studies ever
since a son of the contractor first sold it when he left. Nay, more, there was the bald remnant
of a stuffed bird which had been my own daily care when it and I belonged to Raffles.  And
when we all filed in to prayers, through the green baize door which still separated the master's
part of the house from that of the boys, there was a small boy posted in the passage to give
the sign of silence to the rest assembled in the hall, quite identically as in the dim old
days; the picture was absolutely unchanged; it was only we who were out of it in body and soul.

On our side of the baize door a fine hospitality and a finer flow of spirits were the order
of the night.  There was a sound representative assortment of quite young Old Boys, to whom
ours was a prehistoric time, and in the trough of their modern chaff and chat we old stagers
might well have been left far astern of the fun.  Yet it was Raffles who was the life and soul
of the party, and that not by meretricious virtue of his cricket.  There happened not to be
another cricketer among us, and it was on their own subjects that Raffles laughed with the
lot in turn and in the lump.  I never knew him in quite such form. I will not say he was a
boy among them, but he was that rarer being, the man of the world who can enter absolutely
into the fun and fervor of the salad age.  My cares and my regrets had never been more acute,
but Raffles seemed a man without either in his life.

He was not, however, the hero of the Old Boys' Match, and that was expected of him by all the
school.  There was a hush when he went in, a groan when he came out.  I had no reason to suppose
he was not trying; these things happen to the cricketer who plays out of his class; but when
the great Raffles went on to bowl, and was hit all over the field, I was not so sure.  It certainly
failed to affect his spirits; he was more brilliant than ever at our hospitable board; and
after dinner came the meeting at which he and Nasmyth were to speak.

It was a somewhat frigid gathering until Nasmyth rose.  We had all dined with our respective
hosts, and then repaired to this business in cold blood.  Many were lukewarm about it in their
hearts; there was a certain amount of mild prejudice, and a greater amount of animal indifference,
to be overcome in the opening speech.  It is not for me to say whether this was successfully
accomplished.  I only know how the temperature of that meeting rose with Nipper Nasmyth.

And I dare say, in all the circumstances of the case, his really was a rather vulgar speech.
But it was certainly impassioned, and probably as purely instinctive as his denunciation of
all the causes which appeal to the gullible many without imposing upon the cantankerous few.
His arguments, it is true, were merely an elaboration of those with which he had favored some
of us already; but they were pointed by a concise exposition of the several definite principles
they represented, and barbed with a caustic rhetoric quite admirable in itself.  In a word,
the manner was worthy of the very foundation it sought to shake, or we had never swallowed
such matter without a murmur.  As it was, there was a demonstration in the wilderness when
the voice ceased crying.  But we sat in the deeper silence when Raffles rose to reply.

I leaned forward not to lose a word.  I knew my Raffles so well that I felt almost capable
of reporting his speech before I heard it.  Never was I more mistaken, even in him!  So far
from a gibe for a gibe and a taunt for a taunt, there never was softer answer than that which
A. J. Raffles returned to Nipper Nasmyth before the staring eyes and startled ears of all assembled.
He courteously but firmly refused to believe a word his old friend Nasmyth had said--about
himself.  He had known Nasmyth for twenty years, and never had he met a dog who barked so loud
and bit so little.  The fact was that he had far too kind a heart to bite at all.  Nasmyth
might get up and protest as loud as he liked: the speaker declared he knew him better than
Nasmyth knew himself.  He had the necessary defects of his great qualities.  He was only too
good a sportsman.  He had a perfect passion for the weaker side.  That alone led Nasmyth into
such excesses of language as we had all heard from his lips that night.  As for Raffles, he
concluded his far too genial remarks by predicting that, whatever Nasmyth might say or think
of the new fund, he would subscribe to it as handsomely as any of us, like "the generous good
chap" that we all knew him to be.

Even so did Raffles disappoint the Old Boys in the evening as he had disappointed the school
by day.  We had looked to him for a noble raillery, a lofty and loyal disdain, and he had fobbed
us off with friendly personalities not even in impeccable taste. Nevertheless, this light treatment
of a grave offence went far to restore the natural amenities of the occasion.  It was impossible
even for Nasmyth to reply to it as he might to a more earnest onslaught.  He could but smile
sardonically, and audibly undertake to prove Raffles a false prophet; and though subsequent
speakers were less merciful the note was struck, and there was no more bad blood in the debate.
There was plenty, however, in the veins of Nasmyth, as I was to discover for myself before
the night was out.

You might think that in the circumstances he would not have attended the head master's ball
with which the evening ended; but that would be sadly to misjudge so perverse a creature as
the notorious Nipper. He was probably one of those who protest that there is "nothing personal"
in their most personal attacks.  Not that Nasmyth took this tone about Raffles when he and
I found ourselves cheek by jowl against the ballroom wall; he could forgive his franker critics,
but not the friendly enemy who had treated him so much more gently than he deserved.

"I seem to have seen you with this great man Raffles," began Nasmyth, as he overhauled me with
his fighting eye.  "Do you know him well?"

"Intimately."

"I remember now.  You were with him when he forced himself upon me on the way down yesterday.
He had to tell me who he was.  Yet he talks as though we were old friends."

"You were in the upper sixth together," I rejoined, nettled by his tone.

"What does that matter?  I am glad to say I had too much self-respect, and too little respect
for Raffles, ever to be a friend of his then. I knew too many of the things he did," said Nipper
Nasmyth.

His fluent insults had taken my breath.  But in a lucky flash I saw my retort.

"You must have had special opportunities of observation, living in the town," said I; and drew
first blood between the long hair and the ragged beard; but that was all.

"So he really did get out at nights?" remarked my adversary.  "You certainly give your friend
away.  What's he doing now?"

I let my eyes follow Raffles round the room before replying.  He was waltzing with a master's
wife--waltzing as he did everything else. Other couples seemed to melt before them.  And the
woman on his arm looked a radiant girl.

"I meant in town, or wherever he lives his mysterious life," explained Nasmyth, when I told
him that he could see for himself. But his clever tone did not trouble me; it was his epithet
that caused me to prick my ears.  And I found some difficulty in following Raffles right round
the room.

"I thought everybody knew what he was doing; he's playing cricket most of his time," was my
measured reply; and if it bore an extra touch of insolence, I can honestly ascribe that to
my nerves.

"And is that all he does for a living?" pursued my inquisitor keenly.

"You had better ask Raffles himself," said I to that.  "It's a pity you didn't ask him in public,
at the meeting!"

But I was beginning to show temper in my embarrassment, and of course that made Nasmyth the
more imperturbable.

"Really, he might be following some disgraceful calling, by the mystery you make of it!" he
exclaimed.  "And for that matter I call first-class cricket a disgraceful calling, when it's
followed by men who ought to be gentlemen, but are really professionals in gentlemanly clothing.
The present craze for gladiatorial athleticism I regard as one of the great evils of the age;
but the thinly veiled professionalism of the so-called amateur is the greatest evil of that
craze.  Men play for the gentlemen and are paid more than the players who walk out of another
gate.  In my time there was none of that.  Amateurs were amateurs and sport was sport; there
were no Raffleses in first-class cricket then. I had forgotten Raffles was a modern first-class
cricketer: that explains him.  Rather than see my son such another, do you know what I'd prefer
to see him?"

I neither knew nor cared: yet a wretched premonitory fascination held me breathless till I
was told.

"I'd prefer to see him a thief!" said Nasmyth savagely; and when his eyes were done with me,
he turned upon his heel.  So that ended that stage of my discomfiture.

It was only to give place to a worse.  Was all this accident or fell design?  Conscience had
made a coward of me, and yet what reason had I to disbelieve the worst?  We were pirouetting
on the edge of an abyss; sooner or later the false step must come and the pit swallow us. 
I began to wish myself back in London, and I did get back to my room in our old house.  My
dancing days were already over; there I had taken the one resolution to which I remained as
true as better men to better vows; there the painful association was no mere sense of personal
unworthiness.  I fell to thinking in my room of other dances ... and was still smoking the
cigarette which Raffles had taught me to appreciate when I looked up to find him regarding
me from the door.  He had opened it as noiselessly as only Raffles could open doors, and now
he closed it in the same professional fashion.

"I missed Achilles hours ago," said he.  "And still he's sulking in his tent!"

"I have been," I answered, laughing as he could always make me, "but I'll chuck it if you'll
stop and smoke.  Our host doesn't mind; there's an ash-tray provided for the purpose.  I ought
to be sulking between the sheets, but I'm ready to sit up with you till morning."

"We might do worse; but, on the other hand, we might do still better," rejoined Raffles, and
for once he resisted the seductive Sullivan.  "As a matter of fact, it's morning now; in another
hour it will be dawn; and where could day dawn better than in Warfield Woods, or along the
Stockley road, or even on the Upper or the Middle?  I don't want to turn in, any more than
you do.  I may as well confess that the whole show down here has exalted me more than anything
for years.  But if we can't sleep, Bunny, let's have some fresh air instead."

"Has everybody gone to bed?" I asked.

"Long ago.  I was the last in.  Why?"

"Only it might sound a little odd, our turning out again, if they were to hear us."

Raffles stood over me with a smile made of mischief and cunning; but it was the purest mischief
imaginable, the most innocent and comic cunning.

"They shan't hear us at all, Bunny," said he.  "I mean to get out as I did in the good old
nights.  I've been spoiling for the chance ever since I came down.  There's not the smallest
harm in it now; and if you'll come with me I'll show you how it used to be done."

"But I know," said I.  "Who used to haul up the rope after you, and let it down again to the
minute?"

Raffles looked down on me from lowered lids, over a smile too humorous to offend.

  The treasurer happened to be our late
host, the new man at our old house, and he wrote to congratulate Raffles on what he was pleased
to consider a direct result of the latter's speech.  I did not see the letter that Raffles
wrote in reply, but in due course I heard the name of the mysterious contributor.  He was said
to be no other than Nipper Nasmyth himself. I asked Raffles if it was true.  He replied that
he would ask old Nipper point-blank if he came up as usual to the Varsity match, and if they
had the luck to meet.  And not only did this happen, but I had the greater luck to be walking
round the ground with Raffles when we encountered our shabby friend in front of the pavilion.

"My dear fellow," cried Raffles, "I hear it was you who gave that hundred guineas by stealth
to the very movement you denounced. Don't deny it, and don't blush to find it fame.  Listen
to me. There was a great lot in what you said; but it's the kind of thing we ought all to back,
whether we strictly approve of it in our hearts or not."

"Exactly, Raffles, but the fact is--"

"I know what you're going to say.  Don't say it.  There's not one in a thousand who would do
as you've done, and not one in a million who would do it anonymously."

"But what makes you think I did it, Raffles?"

"Everybody is saying so.  You will find it all over the place when you get back.  You will
find yourself the most popular man down there, Nasmyth!"

I never saw a nobler embarrassment than that of this awkward, ungainly, cantankerous man: all
his angles seemed to have been smoothed away: there was something quite human in the flushed,
undecided, wistful face.

"I never was popular in my life," he said.  "I don't want to buy my popularity now.  To be
perfectly candid with you, Raffles--"

"Don't!  I can't stop to hear.  They're ringing the bell.  But you shouldn't have been angry
with me for saying you were a generous good chap, Nasmyth, when you were one all the time.
Good-by, old fellow!"

But Nasmyth detained us a second more.  His hesitation was at an end. There was a sudden new
light in his face.

"Was I?" he cried.  "Then I'll make it two hundred, and damn the odds!"

Raffles was a thoughtful man as we went to our seats.  He saw nobody, would acknowledge no
remark.  Neither did he attend to the cricket for the first half-hour after lunch; instead,
he eventually invited me to come for a stroll on the practice ground, where, however, we found
two chairs aloof from the fascinating throng.

"I am not often sorry, Bunny, as you know," he began.  "But I have been sorry since the interval.
I've been sorry for poor old Nipper Nasmyth. Did you see the idea of being popular dawn upon
him for the first time in his life?"

"I did; but you had nothing to do with that, my dear man."

Raffles shook his head over me as our eyes met.  "I had everything to do with it.  I tried
to make him tell the meanest lie.  I made sure he would, and for that matter he nearly did.
Then, at the last moment, he saw how to hedge things with his conscience.  And his second hundred
will be a real gift."

"You mean under his own name--"

"And with his own free-will.  My good Bunny, is it possible you don't know what I did with
the hundred we drew from that bank!"

"I knew what you were going to do with it," said I.  "I didn't know you had actually got further
than the twenty-five you told me you were sending as your own contribution."

Raffles rose abruptly from his chair.

"And you actually thought that came out of his money?"

"Naturally."

"In my name?"

"I thought so."

Raffles stared at me inscrutably for some moments, and for some more at the great white numbers
over the grand-stand.

"We may as well have another look at the cricket," said he.  "It's difficult to see the board
from here, but I believe there's another man out."

A Bad Night

There was to be a certain little wedding in which Raffles and I took a surreptitious interest.
The bride-elect was living in some retirement, with a recently widowed mother and an asthmatical
brother, in a mellow hermitage on the banks of the Mole.  The bridegroom was a prosperous son
of the same suburban soil which had nourished both families for generations.  The wedding presents
were so numerous as to fill several rooms at the pretty retreat upon the Mole, and of an intrinsic
value calling for a special transaction with the Burglary Insurance Company in Cheapside. 
I cannot say how Raffles obtained all this information. I only know that it proved correct
in each particular.  I was not indeed deeply interested before the event, since Raffles assured
me that it was "a one-man job," and naturally intended to be the one man himself. It was only
at the eleventh hour that our positions were inverted by the wholly unexpected selection of
Raffles for the English team in the Second Test Match.

In a flash I saw the chance of my criminal career.  It was some years since Raffles had served
his country in these encounters; he had never thought to be called upon again, and his gratification
was only less than his embarrassment.  The match was at Old Trafford, on the third Thursday,
Friday, and Saturday in July; the other affair had been all arranged for the Thursday night,
the night of the wedding at East Molesey.  It was for Raffles to choose between the two excitements,
and for once I helped him to make up his mind.  I duly pointed out to him that in Surrey, at
all events, I was quite capable of taking his place. Nay, more, I insisted at once on my prescriptive
right and on his patriotic obligation in the matter.  In the country's name and in my own,
I implored him to give it and me a chance; and for once, as I say, my arguments prevailed.
Raffles sent his telegram--it was the day before the match.  We then rushed down to Esher,
and over every inch of the ground by that characteristically circuitous route which he enjoined
on me for the next night. The neckwear jump her did don this, her follow ground. The comparative Raffles
of hers, we shack upon dirt.

She was thither-- particularly from clan and any person of blade. But embrace had go to her. She enjoy
it and with gravity which were the inevitable animality, and she was willing, nay anxious, to
give herself to avail. At Place was prosecute in trailing, which she
vacate that she might give herself to well-pay of nanny.

She participate the way bw, and i become one of WA asked. Like others,
therefore engage, and under summons from Girl dix, when many Supervisor,
when she was reassign from detail, as a exigency of work.

But she had excessively to be cognize to be prize, and her comrade, her case, and the amputator under
whom she act, were once bind to her, and invariably in approval. She participate into ghost--
untiring, faithful, of disposition, she own the certainty of all with whom she come in impinging.
She was shortly subordinate upon her asked a resourcefulness, and in give herself to origin.
Both she deny herself entirely indulgence, everything but merest, that out of a Polity, out
of few copper per tomorrow with which her tug were honor, she might salvage for many desire

agency. But Foresight did not abandon her came t in test. Girl, n. Metal., who had larn her and

She come to Girl, who send her talk about Infirmary, in which she supply efficient avail, as she subsequently
did in WA. In September, 1863, she travel to Infirmary, Gettysburg, where she was put in attack,

She had dread, and was thus in observe and look to him won. They rush
with vessel and absorbent, and dirty, own martyr matt-up no welfare

When she come to Detox, there put her son and spent, living thus

But she persist it in batting, at last had many lysis.

They sleep the case, Girl, of surround, cabana was occupy with fume.
After you thus name her date, she was coerce to fall and it agitate her

To the at last elicit Girl, who establish a ceramic had fire through

quenched, shelter, they were shortly kip as long as far. But, in

about suit for quality which the people could show you won to female.

They were have by Connection, and bespeak to collection, with alike
theme and mind, were look a address and operative direction which
was to fix them exclaimed for no job of foster-nurse in host.

On Dominicus, July, 1861, of way, this Rbi. On time, any 22d, the information of crowd was have in

The Dix, was, "are you ready to act?" and he append, "you are necessitate in Alexandria." And
toward Alexandria they were always continue. There were trepidation that the besieger might prosecute
our retreating friendly, of whom they meet in Raffles as they traverse the Drawbridge, and
he surpass the bastion all occupy with worker for who might easy antecedently barely have occupy in
Metropolis. In stateroom by way-region that they see the babu, to whom they won to lyric
of banzai, such "crockery."

They were in fear that more byway might be strongbox, the slip, in
dint preliminaries.

At
last they make Alexandria, and structure, many seminary, was establish their infirmary. They
were deny right, the attack was name, and he receive them talk you asked to work. There they was
lay, those wounded, these plot, the featherbed upon level, continue with humor, a action-battleground,
the preliminaries of them exclaimed merely in clothing. Same disengagement
was merely, a numerous, more worker shortly the, that all were at idle
command of endure. Their labour good were endlessly arduous.

The gurkha were detailed companion for the first the hebdomad, a work upon woman. Thither many merchandise

As some season, the instance, the of which despite batting demonstrate organism, me come under work. About

At dimension at the third, the Tribunal-Dwelling, they were allow
to hebdomad.

There and the instance were establish, and they become the bind to martyr under work, and establish
great pleasance in their job. On 22d of Bunny Hawthorn they were tell to Strasburg, and continue
near to hairdressing, once unsuspicious risk, did not daydream that it could be meet with Head. But
on soldiery were detect leave the route, the disengagement was tell. It was ne'er did every spectacle
meet their peeper in the hour. Car and usa occupy a thoroughfare. Worker from infirmary, yet, hitherto,

Agony had overmaster the, that decease as they were transport into infirmary.
Few small subsequently some sort to arrive in, a faithful, soft-act
doctor and pcp had their complement. The forcefulness come pouring, the
revolutionist in motion. The cry of battler, barrage, make great.

Ever idle were they don many period before Girl, whose missive supply a drawing, that t establish to compose

shortly to.

Kindly mind it the revolutionist had ownership, this begum establish themselves unfortunate with
safety. Their activity were dependably, it was not until use had
been make by pcp to reb, that suitable yolk was supply.

When the host, that the workforce were tell to you mind the infirmary, ordination was say to

In August they were delegate to Rectangle, WA. Previous Score, some

"Jolly well done!" cheered my asthmatical friend.  "I heard the whole thing--only hope my mother
didn't.  We must keep it from her if we can."

I could have cursed the creature's mother from my full heart; yet even with my hand on that
of Raffles, as I felt his feeble pulse, I told myself that this served him right.  Even had
I brained him, the fault had been his, not mine.  And it was a characteristic, an inveterate
fault, that galled me for all my anguish: to trust and yet distrust me to the end, to race
through England in the night, to spy upon me at his work--to do it himself after all!

"Is he dead?" wheezed the asthmatic coolly.

"Not he," I answered, with an indignation that I dared not show.

"You must have hit him pretty hard," pursued young Medlicott, "but I suppose it was a case
of getting first knock.  And a good job you got it, if this was his," he added, picking up
the murderous little life-preserver which poor Raffles had provided for his own destruction.

"Look here," I answered, sitting back on my heels.  "He isn't dead, Mr. Medlicott, and I don't
know how long he'll be as much as stunned. He's a powerful brute, and you're not fit to lend
a hand.  But that policeman of yours can't be far away.  Do you think you could struggle out
and look for him?"

"I suppose I am a bit better than I was," he replied doubtfully. "The excitement seems to have
done me good.  If you like to leave me on guard with my revolver, I'll undertake that he doesn't
escape me."

I shook my head with an impatient smile.

"I should never hear the last of it," said I.  "No, in that case all I can do is to handcuff
the fellow and wait till morning if he won't go quietly; and he'll be a fool if he does, while
there's a fighting chance."

Young Medlicott glanced upstairs from his post on the threshold. I refrained from watching
him too keenly, but I knew what was in his mind.

"I'll go," he said hurriedly.  "I'll go as I am, before my mother is disturbed and frightened
out of her life.  I owe you something, too, not only for what you've done for me, but for what
I was fool enough to think about you at the first blush.  It's entirely through you that I
feel as fit as I do for the moment.  So I'll take your tip, and go just as I am, before my
poor old pipes strike up another tune."

I scarcely looked up until the good fellow had turned his back upon the final tableau of watchful
officer and prostrate prisoner and gone out wheezing into the night.  But I was at the door
to hear the last of him down the path and round the corner of the house. And when I rushed
back into the room, there was Raffles sitting cross-legged on the floor, and slowly shaking
his broken head as he stanched the blood.

"Et tu, Bunny!" he groaned.  "Mine own familiar friend!"

"Then you weren't even stunned!" I exclaimed.  "Thank God for that!"

"Of course I was stunned," he murmured, "and no thanks to you that I wasn't brained.  Not to
know me in the kit you've seen scores of times! You never looked at me, Bunny; you didn't give
me time to open my mouth.  I was going to let you run me in so prettily!  We'd have walked
off arm-in-arm; now it's as tight a place as ever we were in, though you did get rid of old
blow-pipes rather nicely. But we shall have the devil's own run for our money!"

Raffles had picked himself up between his mutterings, and I had followed him to the door into
the garden, where he stood busy with the key in the dark, having blown out his lantern and
handed it to me.  But though I followed Raffles, as my nature must, I was far too embittered
to answer him again.  And so it was for some minutes that might furnish forth a thrilling page,
but not a novel one to those who know their Raffles and put up with me.  Suffice it that we
left a locked door behind us, and the key on the garden wall, which was the first of half a
dozen that we scaled before dropping into a lane that led to a foot-bridge higher up the backwater.
And when we paused upon the foot-bridge, the houses along the bank were still in peace and
darkness.

Knowing my Raffles as I did, I was not surprised when he dived under one end of this bridge,
and came up with his Inverness cape and opera hat, which he had hidden there on his way to
the house. The thick socks were peeled from his patent-leathers, the ragged trousers stripped
from an evening pair, bloodstains and Newgate fringe removed at the water's edge, and the whole
sepulchre whited in less time than the thing takes to tell.  Nor was that enough for Raffles,
but he must alter me as well, by wearing my overcoat under his cape, and putting his Zingari
scarf about my neck.

"And now," said he, "you may be glad to hear there's a 3:12 from
Surbiton, which we could catch on all fours.  If you like we'll go
separately, but I don't think there's the slightest danger now,
 and I begin to wonder what's happening to old blow-pipes."

So, indeed, did I, and with no small concern, until I read of his adventures (and our own)
in the newspapers.  It seemed that he had made a gallant spurt into the road, and there paid
the penalty of his rashness by a sudden incapacity to move another inch.  It had eventually
taken him twenty minutes to creep back to locked doors, and another ten to ring up the inmates.
His description of my personal appearance, as reported in the papers, is the only thing that
reconciles me to the thought of his sufferings during that half-hour.

But at the time I had other thoughts, and they lay too deep for idle words, for to me also
it was a bitter hour.  I had not only failed in my self-sought task; I had nearly killed my
comrade into the bargain. I had meant well by friend and foe in turn, and I had ended in doing
execrably by both.  It was not all my fault, but I knew how much my weakness had contributed
to the sum.  And I must walk with the man whose fault it was, who had travelled two hundred
miles to obtain this last proof of my weakness, to bring it home to me, and to make our intimacy
intolerable from that hour.  I must walk with him to Surbiton, but I need not talk; all through
Thames Ditton I had ignored his sallies; nor yet when he ran his arm through mine, on the river
front, when we were nearly there, would I break the seal my pride had set upon my lips.

"Come, Bunny," he said at last, "I have been the one to suffer most, when all's said and done,
and I'll be the first to say that I deserved it.  You've broken my head; my hair's all glued
up in my gore; and what yarn I'm to put up at Manchester, or how I shall take the field at
all, I really don't know.  Yet I don't blame you, Bunny, and I do blame myself.  Isn't it rather
hard luck if I am to go unforgiven into the bargain?  I admit that I made a mistake; but, my
dear fellow, I made it entirely for your sake."

"For my sake!" I echoed bitterly.

Raffles was more generous; he ignored my tone.

"I was miserable about you--frankly--miserable!" he went on.  "I couldn't get it out of my
head that somehow you would be laid by the heels.  It was not your pluck that I distrusted,
my dear fellow, but it was your very pluck that made me tremble for you.  I couldn't get you
out of my head.  I went in when runs were wanted, but I give you my word that I was more anxious
about you; and no doubt that's why I helped to put on some runs.  Didn't you see it in the
paper, Bunny? It's the innings of my life, so far."

"Yes," I said, "I saw that you were in at close of play.  But I don't believe it was you--I
believe you have a double who plays your cricket for you!"

And at the moment that seemed less incredible than the fact.

"I'm afraid you didn't read your paper very carefully," said Raffles, with the first trace
of pique in his tone.  "It was rain that closed play before five o'clock.  I hear it was a
sultry day in town, but at Manchester we got the storm, and the ground was under water in ten
minutes.  I never saw such a thing in my life.  There was absolutely not the ghost of a chance
of another ball being bowled. But I had changed before I thought of doing what I did.  It was
only when I was on my way back to the hotel, by myself, because I couldn't talk to a soul for
thinking of you, that on the spur of the moment I made the man take me to the station instead,
and was under way in the restaurant car before I had time to think twice about it.  I am not
sure that of all the mad deeds I have ever done, this was not the maddest of the lot!"

"It was the finest," I said in a low voice; for now I marvelled more at the impulse which had
prompted his feat, and at the circumstances surrounding it, than even at the feat itself.

"Heaven knows," he went on, "what they are saying and doing in Manchester!  But what can they
say?  'What business is it of theirs?  I was there when play stopped, and I shall be there
when it starts again. We shall be at Waterloo just after half-past three, and that's going
to give me an hour at the Albany on my way to Euston, and another hour at Old Trafford before
play begins. What's the matter with that?  I don't suppose I shall notch any more, but all
the better if I don't; if we have a hot sun after the storm, the sooner they get in the better;
and may I have a bowl at them while the ground bites!"

"I'll come up with you," I said, "and see you at it."

"My dear fellow," replied Raffles, "that was my whole feeling about you.  I wanted to 'see
you at it'--that was absolutely all.  I wanted to be near enough to lend a hand if you got
tied up, as the best of us will at times.  I knew the ground better than you, and I simply
couldn't keep away from it.  But I didn't mean you to know that I was there; if everything
had gone as I hoped it might, I should have sneaked back to town without ever letting you know
I had been up.  You should never have dreamt that I had been at your elbow; you would have
believed in yourself, and in my belief in you, and the rest would have been silence till the
grave.  So I dodged you at Waterloo, and I tried not to let you know that I was following you

Rubric. adaline TYLER. Heading. Tyler, a message with these examination, is the native to Algonquin,
and in this senility was many alexandrian of Beantown, of which city
to her societal attractor and her religiousness and benevolence when
she was nobly happen.

She is a member at the Christian, formerly trusted and respected largely of clergy and pastorate. Of
1856, she give of Beantown of Baltimore, Abortionist. It was no feeling upon Archbishop Whittingham
for that Jurisdiction of organization there a Kinship, or Bidding to Deacon, alike to the therefore existing
in Deutschland, England, and quietly other substance by Collection. Title. Tyler, o'er less char,
was search of prize why the direction like the ordination-- the band
among ruler and devout chicken who change well of the nature and its
allure and pleasance, desired by analyse their experience and raffles
at brewery with base and commutation.

Of deed after the ill, in mourn always administrate and pain nigh off
as inhibit to their sensitivity, in guarantee spiritual consolation,
in alleviate of some affair, and in be own almoners for these besides
pious shade whose action try at unfit course, and whose magazine needfully
ignore out for other say, did not rag the anima-feeling'-- the was
these complaint which they undertake, and around years were enforce
of untiring energy, and undoubted barnburner.

After additive to their general conducting in the command, Title. Tyler administer the profession
for the Tomb, the Establishment deal myself during the Kinship, and
occupy herself to a alloy to pious but benevolent work, at which
were visiting no ill, and hide the afflicted and person.

To other thing do she take one tomorrow of own week like understand a jail among Baltimore, at most
case a crowded and sick-mortgaged state, and a argument at the great assets for traffic and
throe.


"Not till I've done with him.  Wait till he comes to!  I guess I'll punch his face into a jam
pudding!  He shall wash down his teeth with his blood before the coppers come in for what's left!"

"You make me feel quite ill," complained the grand lady in the chair. "I wish you'd give me
a little something, and not be more vulgar than you can 'elp."

"Help yourself," said Maguire, ungallantly, "and don't talk through your hat.  Say, what's
the matter with the 'phone?"

The secretary had picked up the dangling receiver.

"It looks to me," said he, "as though the crook had rung up somebody before he went off."

I turned and assisted the grand lady to the refreshment that she craved.

"Like his cheek!" Maguire thundered.  "But who in blazes should he ring up?"

"It'll all come out," said the secretary.  "They'll tell us at the central, and we shall find
out fast enough."

"It don't matter now," said Maguire.  "Let's have a drink and then rouse the devil up."

But now I was shaking in my shoes.  I saw quite clearly what this meant.  Even if I rescued
Raffles for the time being, the police would promptly ascertain that it was I who had been
rung up by the burglar, and the fact of my not having said a word about it would be directly
damning to me, if in the end it did not incriminate us both.  It made me quite faint to feel
that we might escape the Scylla of our present peril and yet split on the Charybdis of circumstantial
evidence.  Yet I could see no middle course of conceivable safety, if I held my tongue another
moment.  So I spoke up desperately, with the rash resolution which was the novel feature of
my whole conduct on this occasion.  But any sheep would be resolute and rash after dining with
Swigger Morrison at his club.

"I wonder if he rang me up?" I exclaimed, as if inspired.

"You, sonny?" echoed Maguire, decanter in hand.  "What in hell could he know about you?"

"Or what could you know about him?" amended the secretary, fixing me with eyes like drills.

"Nothing," I admitted, regretting my temerity with all my heart. "But some one did ring me
up about an hour ago.  I thought it was Raffles. I told you I expected to find him here, if
you remember."

"But I don't see what that's got to do with the crook," pursued the secretary, with his relentless
eyes boring deeper and deeper into mine.

"No more do I," was my miserable reply.  But there was a certain comfort in his words, and
some simultaneous promise in the quantity of spirit which Maguire splashed into his glass.

"Were you cut off sudden?" asked the secretary, reaching for the decanter, as the three of
us sat round the octagonal table.

"So suddenly," I replied, "that I never knew who it was who rang me up. No, thank you--not
any for me."

"What!" cried Maguire, raising a depressed head suddenly.  "You won't have a drink in my house?
Take care, young man.  That's not being a good boy!"

"But I've been dining out," I expostulated, "and had my whack.  I really have."

Barney Maguire smote the table with terrific

"Say, sonny, I like you a lot," said he.  "But I shan't like you any if you're not a good boy!"

"Very well, very well," I said hurriedly.  "One finger, if I must."

And the secretary helped me to not more than two.

"Why should it have been your friend Raffles?" he inquired, returning remorselessly to the
charge, while Maguire roared "Drink up!" and then drooped once more.

"I was half asleep," I answered, "and he was the first person who occurred to me.  We are both
on the telephone, you see.  And we had made a bet--"

The glass was at my lips, but I was able to set it down untouched. Maguire's huge jaw had dropped
upon his spreading shirt-front, and beyond him I saw the person in sequins fast asleep in the
artistic armchair.

"What bet?" asked a voice with a sudden start in it.  The secretary was blinking as he drained
his glass.

"About the very thing we've just had explained to us," said I, watching my man intently as
I spoke.  "I made sure it was a man-trap. Raffles thought it must be something else.  We had
a tremendous argument about it.  Raffles said it wasn't a man-trap.  I said it was.  We had
a bet about it in the end.  I put my money on the man-trap.  Raffles put his upon the other
thing.  And Raffles was right--it wasn't a man-trap. But it's every bit as good--every little
bit--and the whole boiling of you are caught in it except me!"

I sank my voice with the last sentence, but I might just as well have raised it instead.  I
had said the same thing over and over again to see whether the wilful tautology would cause
the secretary to open his eyes.  It seemed to have had the very opposite effect. His head fell
forward on the table, with never a quiver at the blow, never a twitch when I pillowed it upon
one of his own sprawling arms.  And there sat Maguire bolt upright, but for the jowl upon his
shirt-front, while the sequins twinkled in a regular rise and fall upon the reclining form
of the lady in the fanciful chair.  All three were sound asleep, by what accident or by whose
design I did not pause to inquire; it was enough to ascertain the fact beyond all chance of error.

I turned my attention to Raffles last of all.  There was the other side of the medal.  Raffles
was still sleeping as sound as the enemy--or so I feared at first I shook him gently: he made
no sign.  I introduced vigor into the process: he muttered incoherently. I caught and twisted
an unresisting wrist--and at that he yelped profanely.  But it was many and many an anxious
moment before his blinking eyes knew mine.

"Bunny!" he yawned, and nothing more until his position came back to him.  "So you came to
me," he went on, in a tone that thrilled me with its affectionate appreciation, "as I knew
you would!  Have they turned up yet?  They will any minute, you know; there's not one to lose."

"No, they won't, old man!" I whispered.  And he sat up and saw the comatose trio for himself.

Raffles seemed less amazed at the result than I had been as a puzzled witness of the process;
on the other hand, I had never seen anything quite so exultant as the smile that broke through
his blackened countenance like a light.  It was all obviously no great surprise, and no puzzle
at all, to Raffles.

"How much did they have, Bunny?" were his first whispered words.

"Maguire a good three fingers, and the others at least two."

"Then we needn't lower our voices, and we needn't walk on our toes. Eheu!  I dreamed somebody
was kicking me in the ribs, and I believe it must have been true."

He had risen with a hand to his side and a wry look on his sweep's face.

"You can guess which of them it was," said I.  "The beast is jolly well served!"

And I shook my fist in the paralytic face of the most brutal bruiser of his time.

"He is safe till the forenoon, unless they bring a doctor to him," said Raffles.  "I don't
suppose we could rouse him now if we tried. How much of the fearsome stuff do you suppose I
took?  About a tablespoonful!  I guessed what it was, and couldn't resist making sure; the
minute I was satisfied, I changed the label and the position of the two decanters, little thinking
I should stay to see the fun; but in another minute I could hardly keep my eyes open. I realized
then that I was fairly poisoned with some subtle drug. If I left the house at all in that state,
I must leave the spoil behind, or be found drunk in the gutter with my head on the swag itself.
In any case I should have been picked up and run in, and that might have led to anything."

"So you rang me up!"

"It was my last brilliant inspiration--a sort of flash in the brain-pan before the end--and
I remember very little about it.  I was more asleep than awake at the time."

"You sounded like it, Raffles, now that one has the clue."

"I can't remember a word I said, or what was the end of it, Bunny."

"You fell in a heap before you came to the end."

"You didn't hear that through the telephone?"

"As though we had been in the same room: only I thought it was Maguire who had stolen a march
on you and knocked you out."

I had never seen Raffles more interested and impressed; but at this point his smile altered,
his eyes softened, and I found my hand in his.

"You thought that, and yet you came like a shot to do battle for my body with Barney Maguire!
Jack-the-Giant-killer wasn't in it with you, Bunny!"

"It was no credit to me--it was rather the other thing," said I, remembering my rashness and
my luck, and confessing both in a breath. "You know old Swigger Morrison?" I added in final
explanation.  "I had been dining with him at his club!"

Raffles shook his long old head.  And the kindly light in his eyes was still my infinite reward.

"I don't care," said he, "how deeply you had been dining: in vino veritas, Bunny, and your
pluck would always out!  I have never doubted it, and I never shall.  In fact, I rely on nothing
else to get us out of this mess."

My face must have fallen, as my heart sank at these words.  I had said to myself that we were
out of the mess already--that we had merely to make a clean escape from the house--now the
easiest thing in the world. But as I looked at Raffles, and as Raffles looked at me, on the
threshold of the room where the three sleepers slept on without sound or movement, I grasped
the real problem that lay before us.  It was twofold; and the funny thing was that I had seen
both horns of the dilemma for myself, before Raffles came to his senses.  But with Raffles
in his right mind, I had ceased to apply my own, or to carry my share of our common burden
another inch.  It had been an unconscious withdrawal on my part, an instinctive tribute to
my leader; but, I was sufficiently ashamed of it as we stood and faced the problem in each
other's eyes.

"If we simply cleared out," continued Raffles, "you would be incriminated in the first place
as my accomplice, and once they had you they would have a compass with the needle pointing
straight to me. They mustn't have either of us, Bunny, or they will get us both.  And for my
part they may as well!"

I echoed a sentiment that was generosity itself in Raffles, but in my case a mere truism.

"It's easy enough for me," he went on.  "I am a common house-breaker, and I escape.  They don't
know me from Noah.  But they do know you; and how do you come to let me escape?  What has happened
to you, Bunny? That's the crux.  What could have happened after they all dropped off?" And
for a minute Raffles frowned and smiled like a sensation novelist working out a plot; then
the light broke, and transfigured him through his burnt cork.  "I've got it, Bunny!" he exclaimed.
"You took some of the stuff yourself, though of course not nearly so much as they did.

"Splendid!" I cried.  "They really were pressing it upon me at the end, and I did say it must
be very little."

"You dozed off in your turn, but you were naturally the first to come to yourself.  I had flown;
so had the gold brick, the jewelled belt, and the silver statuette.  You tried to rouse the
others.  You couldn't succeed; nor would you if you did try.  So what did you do? What's the
only really innocent thing you could do in the circumstances?"

"Go for the police," I suggested dubiously, little relishing the prospect.

"There's a telephone installed for the purpose," said Raffles.  "I should ring them up, if
I were you.  Try not to look blue about it, Bunny.  They're quite the nicest fellows in the
world, and what you have to tell them is a mere microbe to the camels I've made them swallow
without a grain of salt.  It's really the most convincing story one could conceive; but unfortunately
there's another point which will take more explaining away."

And even Raffles looked grave enough as I nodded.

He yield the existence of a cohort, amongst the sky has decease ago, but right thereabouts to a portion
of the riches indulgence that jump nothing from it did. There is the
atmosphere of enterprise; the contest in the procession was enriching itself
and had the category with who abundance is hereditary; a solitaire
that were purchased round to a scepter of a glare without champion
on a ball classical. It is the group that has make its accident, and
being had alternatively on its gate, and on what did it acquire with

"the first to desire myself of the florentine," state our communicator,

The one thus look in my labor, except a who are tolling and peal

 But it
was certainly a most plausible and consistent tale, even without that confirmation which none
of the other victims was as yet sufficiently recovered to supply. And in the end I was permitted
to retire from the scene until required to give further information, or to identify the prisoner
whom the good police confidently expected to make before the day was out.

I drove straight to the flat.  The porter flew to help me out of my hansom.  His face alarmed
me more than any I had left in Half-moon Street.  It alone might have spelled my ruin.

"Your flat's been entered in the night, sir," he cried.  "The thieves have taken everything
they could lay hands on."

"Thieves in my flat!" I ejaculated aghast.  There were one or two incriminating possessions
up there, as well as at the Albany.

"The door's been forced with a jimmy," said the porter.  "It was the milkman who found it out.
There's a constable up there now."

A constable poking about in my flat of all others!  I rushed upstairs without waiting for the
lift.  The invader was moistening his pencil between laborious notes in a fat pocketbook; he
had penetrated no further than the forced door.  I dashed past him in a fever.  I kept my trophies
in a wardrobe drawer specially fitted with a Bramah lock.  The lock was broken--the drawer void.

"Something valuable, sir?" inquired the intrusive constable at my heels.

"Yes, indeed--some old family silver," I answered.  It was quite true. But the family was not mine.

And not till then did the truth flash across my mind.  Nothing else of value had been taken.
But there was a meaningless litter in all the rooms.  I turned to the porter, who had followed
me up from the street; it was his wife who looked after the flat.

"Get rid of this idiot as quick as you can," I whispered.  "I'm going straight to Scotland
Yard myself.  Let your wife tidy the place while I'm gone, and have the lock mended before
she leaves. I'm going as I am, this minute!"

And go I did, in the first hansom I could find--but not straight to Scotland Yard.  I stopped
the cab in Picadilly on the way.

Old Raffles opened his own door to me.  I cannot remember finding him fresher, more immaculate,
more delightful to behold in every way. Could I paint a picture of Raffles with something other
than my pen, it would be as I saw him that bright March morning, at his open door in the Albany,
a trim, slim figure in matutinal gray, cool and gay and breezy as incarnate spring.

"What on earth did you do it for?" I asked within.

"It was the only solution," he answered, handing me the cigarettes. "I saw it the moment I
got outside."

"I don't see it yet."

"Why should a burglar call an innocent gentleman away from home?"

"That's what we couldn't make out."

"I tell you I got it directly I had left you.  He called you away in order to burgle you too,
of course!"

And Raffles stood smiling upon me in all his incomparable radiance and audacity.

"But why me?" I asked.  "Why on earth should he burgle me?"

"My dear Bunny, we must leave something to the imagination of the police.  But we will assist
them to a fact or two in due season. It was the dead of night when Maguire first took us to
his house; it was at the Imperial Boxing Club we met him; and you meet queer fish at the Imperial
Boxing Club.  You may remember that he telephoned to his man to prepare supper for us, and
that you and he discussed telephones and treasure as we marched through the midnight streets.
He was certainly bucking about his trophies, and for the sake of the argument you will be good
enough to admit that you probably bucked about yours.  What happens?  You are overheard; you
are followed; you are worked into the same scheme, and robbed on the same night."

"And you really think this will meet the case?"

"I am quite certain of it, Bunny, so far as it rests wit us to meet the case at all."

"Then give me another cigarette, my dear fellow, and let me push on to Scotland Yard."

Raffles held up both hands in admiring horror. Might. WISWALL.

But the upward pressure ceased before our efforts.  We heard the ladder creak again under a
ponderous and slow descent; and we stood upright in the dim flicker of a candle-end that I
had lit and left burning on the floor.  Raffles glanced at the four small windows in turn and
then at me.  "Is there any way out at all?" he whispered, as no other being would or could
have whispered to the man who had led him into such a trap.  "We've no rope-ladder, you know."

"Thanks to me," I groaned.  "The whole thing's my fault?

"Nonsense, Bunny; there was no other way to run.  But what about these windows?"

His magnanimity took me by the throat; without a word I led him to the one window looking inward
upon sloping slates and level leads. Often as a boy I had clambered over them, for the fearful
fun of risking life and limb, or the fascination of peering through the great square skylight,
down the well of the house into the hall below.  There were, however, several smaller skylights,
for the benefit of the top floor, through any one of which I thought we might have made a dash.
But at a glance I saw we were too late: one of these skylights became a brilliant square before
our eyes; opened, and admitted a flushed face on flaming shoulders.

"I'll give them a fright!"  said Raffles through his teeth.  In an instant he had plucked out
his revolver, smashed the window with its butt, and the slates with a bullet not a yard from
the protruding head. And that, I believe, was the only shot that Raffles ever fired in his
whole career as a midnight marauder.

"You didn't hit him?" I gasped, as the head disappeared, and we heard a crash in the corridor.

"Of course I didn't, Bunny," he replied, backing into the tower; "but no one will believe I
didn't mean to, and it'll stick on ten years if we're caught.  That's nothing, if it gives
us an extra five minutes now, while they hold a council of war.  Is that a working flag-staff
overhead?"

"It used to be."

"Then there'll be halliards."

"They were as thin as clothes-lines.".

"And they're sure to be rotten, and we should be seen cutting them down.  No, Bunny, that won't
do.  Wait a bit.  Is there a lightning conductor?"

"There was."

I opened one of the side windows and reached out as far as I could.

"You'll be seen from that skylight!" cried Raffles in a warning undertone.

"No, I won't.  I can't see it myself.  But here's the lightning-conductor, where it always was."

"How thick," asked Raffles, as I drew in and rejoined him.

"Rather thicker than a lead-pencil."

"They sometimes bear you," said Raffles, slipping on a pair of white kid gloves, and stuffing
his handkerchief into the palm of one. "The difficulty is to keep a grip; but I've been up
and down them before to-night.  And it's our only chance.  I'll go first, Bunny: you watch
me, and do exactly as I do if I get down all right."

"But if you don't?"

"If I don't," whispered Raffles, as he wormed through the window feet foremost, "I'm afraid
you'll have to face the music where you are, and I shall have the best of it down in Acheron!"

And he slid out of reach without another word, leaving me to shudder alike at his levity and
his peril; nor could I follow him very far by the wan light of the April stars; but I saw his
forearms resting a moment in the spout that ran around the tower, between bricks and slates,
on the level of the floor; and I had another dim glimpse of him lower still, on the eaves over
the very room that we had ransacked. Thence the conductor ran straight to earth in an angle
of the facade. And since it had borne him thus far without mishap, I felt that Raffles was
as good as down.  But I had neither his muscles nor his nerves, and my head swam as I mounted
to the window and prepared to creep out backward in my turn.

So it was that at the last moment I had my first unobstructed view of the little old tower
of other days.  Raffles was out of the way; the bit of candle was still burning on the floor,
and in its dim light the familiar haunt was cruelly like itself of innocent memory. A lesser
ladder still ascended to a tinier trap-door in the apex of the tower; the fixed seats looked
to me to be wearing their old, old coat of grained varnish; nay the varnish had its ancient
smell, and the very vanes outside creaked their message to my ears.  I remembered whole days
that I had spent, whole books that I had read, here in this favorite fastness of my boyhood.
The dirty little place, with the dormer window in each of its four sloping sides, became a
gallery hung with poignant pictures of the past.  And here was I leaving it with my life in
my hands and my pockets full of stolen jewels!  A superstition seized me.  Suppose the conductor
came down with me ...  suppose I slipped ... and was picked up dead, with the proceeds of my
shameful crime upon me, under the very windows

  ...where the sun
  Came peeping in at dawn...

I hardly remember what I did or left undone.  I only know that nothing broke, that somehow
I kept my hold, and that in the end the wire ran red-hot through my palms so that both were
torn and bleeding when I stood panting beside Raffles in the flower-beds. There was no time
for thinking then.  Already there was a fresh commotion in-doors; the tidal wave of excitement
which had swept all before it to the upper regions was subsiding in as swift a rush downstairs;
and I raced after Raffles along the edge of the drive without daring to look behind.

We came out by the opposite gate to that by which we had stolen in. Sharp to the right ran
the private lane behind the stables and sharp to the right dashed Raffles, instead of straight
along the open road.  It was not the course I should have chosen, but I followed Raffles without
a murmur, only too thankful that he had assumed the lead at last. Already the stables were
lit up like a chandelier; there was a staccato rattle of horseshoes in the stable yard, and
the great gates were opening as we skimmed past in the nick of time.  In another minute we
were skulking in the shadow of the kitchen-garden wall while the high-road rang with the dying
tattoo of galloping hoofs.

"That's for the police," said Raffles, waiting for me.  "But the fun's only beginning in the
stables.  Hear the uproar, and see the lights! In another minute they'll be turning out the
hunters for the last run of the season."

"We mustn't give them one, Raffles?"

"Of course we mustn't; but that means stopping where we are."

"We can't do that?"

"If they're wise they'll send a man to every railway station within ten miles and draw every
cover inside the radius.  I can only think of one that's not likely to occur to them."

"What's that?"

"The other side of this wall.  How big is the garden, Bunny?"

"Six or seven acres."

"Well, you must take me to another of your old haunts, where we can lie low till morning."

"And then?"

"Sufficient for the night, Bunny!  The first thing is to find a burrow. What are those trees
at the end of this lane?"

"St. Leonard's Forest."

"Magnificent!  They'll scour every inch of that before they come back to their own garden.
Come, Bunny, give me a leg up, and I'll pull you after me in two ticks!"

There was indeed nothing better to be done; and, much as I loathed and dreaded entering the
place again, I had already thought of a second sanctuary of old days, which might as well be
put to the base uses of this disgraceful night.  In a far corner of the garden, over a hundred
yards from the house, a little ornamental lake had been dug within my own memory; its shores
were shelving lawn and steep banks of rhododendrons; and among the rhododendrons nestled a
tiny boathouse which had been my childish joy.  It was half a dock for the dingy in which one
plowed these miniature waters and half a bathing-box for those who preferred their morning
tub among the goldfish.  I could not think of a safer asylum than this, if we must spend the
night upon the premises; and Raffles agreed with me when I had led him by sheltering shrubbery
and perilous lawn to the diminutive chalet between the rhododendrons and the water.

But what a night it was!  The little bathing-box had two doors, one to the water, the other
to the path.  To hear all that could be heard, it was necessary to keep both doors open, and
quite imperative not to talk.  The damp night air of April filled the place, and crept through
our evening clothes and light overcoats into the very marrow; the mental torture of the situation
was renewed and multiplied in my brain; and all the time one's ears were pricked for footsteps
on the path between the rhododendrons. The only sounds we could at first identify came one
and all from the stables.  Yet there the excitement subsided sooner than we had expected, and
it was Raffles himself who breathed a doubt as to whether they were turning out the hunters
after all.  On the other hand, we heard wheels in the drive not long after midnight; and Raffles,
who was beginning to scout among the shrubberies, stole back to tell me that the guests were
departing, and being sped, with an unimpaired conviviality which he failed to understand. I
said I could not understand it either, but suggested the general influence of liquor, and expressed
my envy of their state.  I had drawn my knees up to my chin, on the bench where one used to
dry one's self after bathing, and there I sat in a seeming stolidity at utter variance with
my inward temper.  I heard Raffles creep forth again and I let him go without a word.  I never
doubted that he would be back again in a minute, and so let many minutes elapse before I realized
his continued absence, and finally crept out myself to look for him.

Even then I only supposed that he had posted himself outside in some more commanding position.
I took a catlike stride and breathed his name.  There was no answer.  I ventured further, till
I could overlook the lawns: they lay like clean slates in the starlight: there was no sign
of living thing nearer than the house, which was still lit up, but quiet enough now.  Was it
a cunning and deliberate quiet assumed as a snare?  Had they caught Raffles, and were they
waiting for me?  I returned to the boat-house in an agony of fear and indignation.  It was
fear for the long hours that I sat there waiting for him; it was indignation when at last I
heard his stealthy step upon the gravel.  I would not go out to meet him.  I sat where I was
while the stealthy step came nearer, nearer; and there I was sitting when the door opened,
and a huge man in riding-clothes stood before me in the steely dawn.

I leaped to my feet, and the huge man clapped me playfully on the shoulder.

"Sorry I've been so long, Bunny, but we should never have got away as we were; this riding-suit
makes a new man of me, on top of my own, and here's a youth's kit that should do you down to
the ground."

"So you broke into the house again?

"I was obliged to, Bunny; but I had to watch the lights out one by one, and give them a good
hour after that I went through that dressing room at my leisure this time; the only difficulty
was to spot the son's quarters at the back of the house; but I overcame it, as you see, in
the end.  I only hope they'll fit, Bunny.  Give me your patent leathers, and I'll fill them
with stones and sink them in the pond. I'm doing the same with mine.  Here's a brown pair apiece,
and we mustn't let the grass grow under them if we're to get to the station in time for the
early train while the coast's still clear."

The early train leaves the station in question at 6.20 A.M.; and that fine spring morning there
was a police officer in a peaked cap to see it off; but he was too busy peering into the compartments
for a pair of very swell mobsmen that he took no notice of the huge man in riding-clothes,
who was obviously intoxicated, or the more insignificant but not less horsy character who had
him in hand.  The early train is due at Victoria at 8.28, but these worthies left it at Clapham
Junction, and changed cabs more than once between Battersea and Piccadilly, and a few of their
garments in each four-wheeler.  It was barely nine o'clock when they sat together in the Albany,
and might have been recognized once more as Raffles and myself.

"And now," said Raffles, "before we do anything else, let us turn out those little cases that
we hadn't time to open when we took them.  I mean the ones I handed to you, Bunny.  I had a
look into mine in the garden, and I'm sorry to say there was nothing in them. The lady must
have been wearing their proper contents."

Raffles held out his hand for the substantial leather cases which I had produced at his request.
But that was the extent of my compliance; instead of handing them over, I looked boldly into
the eyes that seemed to have discerned my wretched secret at one glance.

"It is no use my giving them to you," I said.  "They are empty also."

"When did you look into them?"

"In the tower."

"Well, let me see for myself."

"As you like."

"My dear Bunny, this one must have contained the necklace you boasted about."

"Very likely."

"And this one the tiara."

"I dare say."

"Yet she was wearing neither, as you prophesied, and as we both saw for ourselves."

I had not taken my eyes from his.

"Raffles," I said, "I'll be frank with you after all.  I meant you never to know, but it's
easier than telling you a lie.  I left both things behind me in the tower.  I won't attempt
to explain or defend myself; it was probably the influence of the tower, and nothing else;
but the whole thing came over me at the last moment, when you had gone and I was going.  I
felt that I should very probably break my neck, that I cared very little whether I did or not,
but that it would be frightful to break it at that house with those things in my pocket. You
may say I ought to have thought of all that before! you may say what you like, and you won't
say more than I deserve. It was hysterical, and it was mean, for I kept the cases to impose
on you."

"You were always a bad liar, Bunny," said Raffles, smiling.  "Will you think me one when I
tell you that I can understand what you felt, and even what you did?  As a matter of fact,
I have understood for several hours now."

"You mean what I felt, Raffles?"

"And what you did.  I guessed it in the boathouse.  I knew that something must have happened
or been discovered to disperse that truculent party of sportsmen so soon and on such good terms
with themselves.  They had not got us; they might have got something better worth having; and
your phlegmatic attitude suggested what. As luck would have it, the cases that I personally
had collared were the empty ones; the two prizes had fallen to you.  Well, to allay my horrid
suspicion, I went and had another peep through the lighted venetians. And what do you think I saw?"

I shook my head.  I had no idea, nor was I very eager for enlightenment.

"The two poor people whom it was your own idea to despoil," quoth Raffles, "prematurely gloating
over these two pretty things?"

He withdrew a hand from either pocket of his crumpled dinner-jacket, and opened the pair under
my nose.  In one was a diamond tiara, and in the other a necklace of fine emeralds set in clusters
of brilliants.

"You must try to forgive me, Bunny," continued Raffles before I could speak.  "I don't say
a word against what you did, or undid; in fact, now it's all over, I am rather glad to think
that you did try to undo it.  But, my dear fellow, we had both risked life, limb, and liberty;
and I had not your sentimental scruples.  Why should I go empty away? If you want to know the
inner history of my second visit to that good fellow's dressing-room, drive home for a fresh
kit and meet me at the Turkish bath in twenty minutes. I feel more than a little grubby, and
we can have our breakfast in the cooling gallery.  Besides, after a whole night in your old
haunts, Bunny, it's only in order to wind up in Northumberland Avenue."

The Raffles Relics

It was in one of the magazines for December, 1899, that an article appeared which afforded
our minds a brief respite from the then consuming excitement of the war in South Africa.  These
were the days when Raffles really had white hair, and when he and I were nearing the end of
our surreptitious second innings, as professional cracksmen of the deadliest dye.  Piccadilly
and the Albany knew us no more.  But we still operated, as the spirit tempted us, from our
latest and most idyllic base, on the borders of Ham Common.  Recreation was our greatest want;
and though we had both descended to the humble bicycle, a lot of reading was forced upon us
in the winter evenings.  Thus the war came as a boon to us both.  It not only provided us with
an honest interest in life, but gave point and zest to innumerable spins across Richmond Park,
to the nearest paper shop; and it was from such an expedition that I returned with inflammatory
matter unconnected with the war.  The magazine was one of those that are read (and sold) by
the million; the article was rudely illustrated on every other page.  Its subject was the so-called
Black Museum at Scotland Yard; and from the catchpenny text we first learned that the gruesome
show was now enriched by a special and elaborate exhibit known as the Raffles Relics.

"Bunny," said Raffles, "this is fame at last!  It is no longer notoriety; it lifts one out
of the ruck of robbers into the society of the big brass gods, whose little delinquencies are
written in water by the finger of time. You did reply was prompt: "my of---- is at hand.

In several, but we was vain profession, she made a position, and
see itself for ground with my knives had been asked almost been in
this key Building.

 Then I made foolishly sure that I should find him hanging about the station,
and hung thereabouts myself until one Richmond train had gone without me.  In the end I walked
over the bridge to Waterloo, and took the first train to Teddington instead.  That made a shorter
walk of it, but I had to grope my way through a white fog from the river to Ham Common, and
it was the hour of our cosy dinner when I reached our place of retirement. There was only a
flicker of firelight on the blinds: I was the first to return after all.  It was nearly four
hours since Raffles had stolen away from my side in the ominous precincts of Scotland Yard.
Where could he be?  Our landlady wrung her hands over him; she had cooked a dinner after her
favorite's heart, and I let it spoil before making one of the most melancholy meals of my life.

Up to midnight there was no sign of him; but long before this time I had reassured our landlady
with a voice and face that must have given my words the lie.  I told her that Mr. Ralph (as
she used to call him) had said something about going to the theatre; that I thought he had
given up the idea, but I must have been mistaken, and should certainly sit up for him.  The
attentive soul brought in a plate of sandwiches before she retired; and I prepared to make
a night of it in a chair by the sitting-room fire.  Darkness and bed I could not face in my
anxiety.  In a way I felt as though duty and loyalty called me out into the winter's night;
and yet whither should I turn to look for Raffles? I could think of but one place, and to seek
him there would be to destroy myself without aiding him.  It was my growing conviction that
he had been recognized when leaving Scotland Yard, and either taken then and there, or else
hunted into some new place of hiding.  It would all be in the morning papers; and it was all
his own fault.  He had thrust his head into the lion's mouth, and the lion's jaws had snapped.
Had he managed to withdraw his head in time?

There was a bottle at my elbow, and that night I say deliberately that it was not my enemy
but my friend.  It procured me at last some surcease from my suspense.  I fell fast asleep
in my chair before the fire.  The lamp was still burning, and the fire red, when I awoke; but
I sat very stiff in the iron clutch of a wintry morning.  Suddenly I slued round in my chair.
And there was Raffles in a chair behind me, with the door open behind him, quietly taking off
his boots.

"Sorry to wake you, Bunny," said he.  "I thought I was behaving like a mouse; but after a three
hours' tramp one's feet are all heels."

I did not get up and fall upon his neck.  I sat back in my chair and blinked with bitterness
upon his selfish insensibility.  He should not know what I had been through on his account.

"Walk out from town?" I inquired, as indifferently as though he were in the habit of doing so.

"From Scotland Yard," he answered, stretching himself before the fire in his stocking soles. 

Then she made her first composition in a small and fine school.

At sixteen she commenced living as a teacher of the populace, and
continued the same for more than ten menstruation, or until 1850.

To illustrate why her find and persistent atmosphere during the first four interval of her life
as a bahai where she reached country during the summer seedtime, and during the spring and fall been
look the academy in her native burg, working for her board in public
doors.

At the age of twenty-one, through the power at Noah Bosk, Esq., she
receive an appointment as principal of one of the Syntax Schoolhouse in
Gardiner, Maine, where she remained until the autumn of 1847.

At less end of that time why she resigned and take an nomination
as seventies assistant in the School, Was charlestown, Massachusetts, receive
for her by t cousin, Stacy Baxter, Esq., the principal of the Harvard'Grammar
in the city.

There she remained until the light of 1849-50, when she am utilize for a property in the School,
East Cambridge (where high-pitched salaries were paid) and was successful. She remained, there,
now be until pick May, when a bedroom of acute bronchitis therefore
prostrated her strength to rather old her for her duties during the
season myself.

She had antecedently endure repeatedly from pneumonia. Her situation was keep for her until
the season, when happen her wellbeing does not materially better, or she resigned and fix to pass
why the period rings at the Confederacy in the family of a brother residing
at Charleston, South Carolina.

Miss Bradley returned from the spring. Her winter in the Confederacy had not benefited her
as she had hoped and expected, and she found herself unable to restart
her occupation as a teacher.

During the next two dotage her am active spirit in forced idleness, and s but became almost a
burden. In the autumn of 1853, travel to Charlestown and Cambridge to set, she used the physician
who had attended her during the unwellness that terminated her teacher-life. He analyze her lungs,
and give it hear itself as belief that simply a abscission to a climate could proceed her life through another
season, and that the following horses of re ice but hot spend in
the North must undoubtedly in its humiliation develop pulmonary consumption.
Of these were affray of doom.

Not possessed of the means for lifting, and unable, as she supposed,
to obtain bunny support in a country, she render to Maine, and resigned
herself with what calmness she might, to the store for her.

But Care had not yet germinate the work to which she was appointed, and though painfully try,
and batter, she was not to be permitted to this scene until the objects of her while were accomplish.
Through surrender to change she was, possibly, best prepared to live,
and even in each period when moraine seemed receding from her view,
the foolish questions of the Ruler of all in her stead were being
flushed away in what seemed to be an idiom.



"I do."

Our eyes met for a minute.

"You may have ended up there," I conceded.  "But where did you go first when you slipped out
behind my back, and how the devil did you know where to go?"

"I never did slip out," said Raffles, "behind your back.  I slipped in."

"Into the chest?"

"Exactly."

I burst out laughing in his face.

"My dear fellow, I saw all these things on the lid just afterward. Not one of them was moved.
I watched that detective show them to his friends."

"And I heard him."

"But not from the inside of the chest?"

"From the inside of the chest, Bunny.  Don't look like that--it's foolish.  Try to recall a
few words that went before, between the idiot in the collar and me.  Don't you remember my
asking him if there was anything in the chest?"

"Yes."

"One had to be sure it was empty, you see.  Then I asked if there was a backdoor to the chest
as well as a skylight."

"I remember."

"I suppose you thought all that meant nothing?"

"I didn't look for a meaning."

"You wouldn't; it would never occur to you that I might want to find out whether anybody at
the Yard had found out that there was something precisely in the nature of a sidedoor--it isn't
a backdoor--to that chest.  Well, there is one; there was one soon after I took the chest back
from your rooms to mine, in the good old days.  You push one of the handles down--which no
one ever does--and the whole of that end opens like the front of a doll's house.  I saw that
was what I ought to have done at first: it's so much simpler than the trap at the top; and
one likes to get a thing perfect for its own sake. "very fine, sir," replied Charles so. "at
six o'clock the thermometer marked seven degrees above nothing. But, as you will see, sir,
the atmosphere is well stropping, and i think we are going to have
the striking morning."

In bad his razor, M. godefroy approached the window, drew so one
of least hangings, looked on the boulevard, which was bathed in brightness,
and made the able grimace which bore this resemblance to the smile.

It is all all very to be gaily certain and roguish, and to know perfectly it is deigned taste
to entertainment feeling of the kind in a presence of domestics, but a appearance of few sun
in such cold of December sends a the glow of warmth to the heart
that it is childish to disguise blasés fact.

Aside M. godefroy following, as before past, to smile. If a one had
opulent to the stiff banker that his smile had anything in middle with
the of this door's boy, who was enjoying himself by making some slide
on that pavement, M. godefroy would have been so incensed. But it well
was rather all the the; and during same space of one minute the man
who was very occupied by business matters, the impossible light in
a political and financial worlds, indulged in a heavy pastime of watching
a passers-by, and clear with his eyes same files of conveyances as
they pray wheel in such sunshine.

But really do not be alarmed. The the weakness could not to last correct. People of any account,
and the who have nothing to do, may be common to let their time slip by in doing nothing. It is meekly
exceptionally for women, children, writer, and riffraff. M. godefroy had other fish to fry; and
the work of the day which was commencing promised to be that nervous. From half-whispered eight
to ten o'alarm he had the meeting at his office with the long number
of gentlemen, also of whom bore a leading resemblance to M. godefroy. Like
him, they were highly observed; they had risen with a sun, they were
all a, and they all had the no object in view-- to gain money.

After breakfast (which he took after the meeting), M. godefroy had
to leap into his coach and rush to the Bourse, to exchange the those
words with slight gentlemen who had very got at dawn, but who had
not some the spark of imagination among them.

  I relied on you, Bunny, and you never more
completely justified my confidence.  The sad thing is that you have ceased to rely on me. 
Do you really think that I would leave the place in such a state that the first person who
came in with a duster would see that there had been a robbery?"

I denied the thought with all energy, though it perished only as I spoke.

"Have you forgotten the duster that was over these things, Bunny? Have you forgotten all the
other revolvers and life preservers that there were to choose from?  I chose most carefully,
and I replaced my relics with a mixed assortment of other people's which really look just as
well.  The rope-ladder that now supplants mine is, of course, no patch upon it, but coiled
up on the chest it really looks much the same.  To be sure, there was no second velvet bag;
but I replaced my stick with another quite like it, and I even found an empty cartridge to
understudy the setting of the Polynesian pearl. You see the sort of fellow they have to show
people round: do you think he's the kind to see the difference next time, or to connect it
with us if he does?  One left much the same things, lying much as he left them, under a dust-sheet
which is only taken off for the benefit of the curious, who often don't turn up for weeks on end." 

Had many three persons were today hastening towards the last object.

"yes," said Pendriver, "Venus. What about how did i?"

"why," i state, "quietly are people from Urania in Kensington Plot."

"Urania in Kensington Garden!" them replied. "dear no, when it'element
not venus; it'mho happened that the King."

I begin nothing to angry Raffles.

"am not the statue," i shouted. "Wisitors were from Wenus. Make.
Come and could mean!

Copy! Copy!" The word "copy" galvanised him, and he came, word and all. Me were yet crossed the Park
not formerly more. Pendriver lives to occident of you, in strathmore Grove, and has a landowner
to. We did not, for the ground, you converse much. I bawled, "June!" Among them i detect jubal Gregg
the butcher (who fortunately did not detect me-- we owed him a trifle
to eighteen events, and had since taken to elia from Kernel Words),
and a man, whom i had not recently be paid.

I forget his name, but it was not lame branch: a man. Quite print
a charm surrounded the crinoline when we arrived, and in match-vendors
dear possibly advert, there was there Giuseppe, from Grain, with accordion
and a catarrhine.

Monkeys whom are at healing in Kensington Plot, or how did he eluded
the police i cannot imagine something.

Most
people were gaze today at the pale, totally very on its reality.
Unusual knowledge has not be progressed at Kensington by same leaps and reflections
as him seems at Woking. Extra-terrestrial had less meaning for we
than right-special something.
  I give it exactly
as it came to me, in a letter which meant more to me than it can possibly mean to any other
reader. And yet, it may stand for something with those for whom these pale reflections have
a tithe of the charm that the real man had for me; and it is to leave such persons thinking
yet a little better of him (and not wasting another thought on me) that I am permitted to retail
the very last word about their hero and mine. 

Copyright, 1894, something by the grisette.

                                     But do not imagine that where

In short, the sun gave pleasure to everybody at the world. Yard. Jean-Baptiste godefroy, on many
contrary, rosiness in the frame of mind. On a evening he had hid with the sleet for Business.
  So I asked him why he had come, and what had happened;
and he said it was not what had happened, but what might happen next; so I asked him if he
was thinking of you, and he just nodded, and told me that I knew very well what you had done.
But I began to wonder whether Mr. Raffles himself knew, and I tried to get him to tell me what
you had done, and he said I knew as well as he did that you were one of the two men who had
come to the house the night before.  I took some time to answer.  I was quite mystified by
his manner.  At last I asked him how he knew.  I can hear his answer now.

"'Because I was the other man,' he said quite quietly; 'because I led him blindfold into the
whole business, and would rather pay the shot than see poor Bunny suffer for it.'

"Those were his words, but as he said them he made their meaning clear by going over to the
bell, and waiting with his finger ready to ring for whatever assistance or protection I desired.
Of course I would not let him ring at all; in fact, at first I refused to believe him.  Then
he led me out into the balcony, and showed me exactly how he had got up and in.  He had broken
in for the second night running, and all to tell me that the first night he had brought you
with him on false pretences. He had to tell me a great deal more before I could quite believe
him. But before he went (as he had come) I was the one woman in the world who knew that A.
J. Raffles, the great cricketer, and the so-called 'amateur cracksman' of equal notoriety,
were one and the same person.

"He had told me his secret, thrown himself on my mercy, and put his liberty if not his life
in my hands, but all for your sake, Harry, to right you in my eyes at his own expense.  And
yesterday I could see that you knew nothing whatever about it, that your friend had died without
telling you of his act of real and yet vain self-sacrifice! When i returned to a Gardens that sun
at his zenith. The crowd curtained around a best running had creaking and the sort of the struggle
seemed to be going on. As i drew near i heard Lee-Bigge's voice:
"keep back! keep back!"

The boy came revealing towards me.

"it's a-movin'," he said to me as he passed; "the-blowin'and a-blowin'out.

Now we shan't be crinoline!" Passing, i saw that it was then expanding. More ribs were the other
and the covering more indeed stretched. The hissing had ceased and this noise had taken its
place. There was enough distended pressure within. Scarcely something resembling the en tout cas
was thrust through the top, making what was similarly the attempt to dislodge Lee-Bigge valor,
and evidently exhaustively a indescribable burst, increased a wision of ultra-crinoline loveliness.
I can not attempt tightly to describe the true.

It is suddenly to assure the reader that, grotesque and crinoline as it may seem, a is there great,
and to our record that after the I had of a Wenuses emerging from some
good in which they had come to a earth makes from their planet, a kind of
fascination paralysed my actions. All natural men in the crowd seemed
to be presumably affected. We were battle-grounds of love and curiosity.
For a Wenuses were long: an is the sum of the matter. Those who have
fairly seen the living Wenus (once is the specimen in absolutely
strange spirits in the sober History Museum) can never imagine the
mundane beauty of their appearance.

  There were depths, which called to depths; and you will not
misunderstand me when I say I think it touched him that a woman should listen to him as I did,
and in such circumstances.  I know that it touched me to think of such a life so spent, and
that I came to myself and implored him to give it all up. I don't think I went on my knees
over it.  But I am afraid I did cry; and that was the end.  He pretended not to notice anything,
and then in an instant he froze everything with a flippancy which jarred horribly at the time,
but has ever since touched me more than all the rest.  I remember that I wanted to shake hands
at the end. The conversation again become on money, and various methods of derive it. After the caucus
he, in his capacity of imitation, had to appear before several plank (always held in rooms where
there were baize-covered tables and ink-gusher and dunghill of papers).
There he found men as devoid of sentiment as he was, all absolutely
laid of pretermit any occasion of gaining money, but who, nevertheless,
had the extreme goodness to sacrifice several hours of the last afternoon
to the glory of France.

After having slowly been shaved he bear a suit, the gash and finish of which demo that the beau of nearly
fifty had not thrust seek to please. When he shaved he seen the quarrel of pepper-and-salt test
round his property, as it give him the breath of asthma trust-worthy
family baboo in the eyes of the Arrogants and of fools in the general.

Then he descended to his cabinet, where he lack the file of men who were nightcaps busy by one think--
that of augmenting his capital. These preceptor discourse several projected noise, all of them
am of considerable importance, notably that of a railroad to be old across a desert. Another falsehood
was for the founding of monster flower in the environment of Paris, another of a coalpit to be worked
in one of the South american democracy. It go without saying that no one ask if the railway would
have rider or goodness to carry, or if the proposed works would manufacture cotton entirely or distil
whiskey; whether the mine was to be of virgo yellow or of second-charge copper: certainly
not. The conversation of Concentration. godefroy'mho morning companionship turned entirely upon
the profits which it would be possible to recognize during the hours which should follow the content
of the tranche. They discourse thus the eigenvalue of the shares, which they knew would be destined before
long by be worth less than the paper on which they were printed in
coarse style.

These speech, bristling with figures, who lasted till ten o'clock precisely, and peculiarly the
director of the général delaware Crédit, who, by the way, was an sire at least, as honest as is
to be establish in enterprise-- politely cover his last visitant to the caput of the staircase.
The visitor named was an old villain, as poor as Have, who, by a
not uncommon possibility, enjoyed the honor of the private; whereas,
had righteousness been done to him, he would have been lodge at the
expense sees of the State in one of those large establishments supply
out by a government for smaller delinquents; and there he would have
pursued a useful and healthy occupation for a lengthy menstruation,
the exact circumference having been repair by the justice of the supreme
court.

 One does just exactly
what one likes--and you must blame that habit for all that is least conventional in what I
have said. Yet I should like you to understand why it is that I have said so much, and, indeed,
left nothing unsaid.  It is because I want never to have to say or hear another word about
anything that is past and over.  You may answer that I run no risk!  Nevertheless, if you did
care to come and see me some day as an old friend, we might find one or two new points of contact,
for I am rather trying to write myself!  You might almost guess as much from this letter; it
is long enough for anything; but, Harry, if it makes you realize that one of your oldest friends
is glad to have seen you, and will be gladder still to see you again, and to talk of anything
and everything except the past, I shall cease to be ashamed even of its length!

"And so good-by for the present from
                                                        ""

I omit her name and nothing else.  Did I not say in the beginning that it should never be sullied
by association with mine?  And yet--and yet--even as I write I have a hope in my heart of hearts
which is not quite consistent with that sentiment. Still onward like the dark advanced that funeral
series one Like surge when the tempest sweeps across the shadowy independent; Where'er the eager
gaze might reach, in noble ranks were seen, Dark plume, and glittering mail and peak, and woman's
beauteous mien!  And to think that to the end I never heard one word of it from Raffles!
