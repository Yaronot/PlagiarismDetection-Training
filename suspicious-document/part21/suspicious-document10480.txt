THE WHITE DESERT

CHAPTER I

It was early afternoon.  Near by, the smaller hills shimmered in the radiant warmth of late
spring, the brownness of their foliage and boulders merging gradually upward to the green of
the spruces and pines of the higher mountains, which in turn gave way before the somber blacks
and whites of the main range, where yet the snow lingered from the clutch of winter, where
the streams ran brown with the down-flow of the continental divide, where every cluster of
mountain foliage sheltered a mound of white, in jealous conflict with the sun.  The mountains
are tenacious of their vicious traits; they cling to the snow and cold and ice long after the
seasons have denoted a time of warmth and summer's splendor; the columbine often blooms beside
a ten-foot drift.

But down in the hollow which shielded the scrambling little town of Dominion, the air was warm
and lazy with the friendliness of May.  Far off, along the course of the tumbling stream, turbulently
striving to care for far more than its share of the melt-water of the hills, a jaybird called
raucously as though in an effort to drown the sweeter, softer notes of a robin nesting in the
new-green of a quaking aspen. At the hitching post before the one tiny store, an old horse
nodded and blinked,--as did the sprawled figure beside the ramshackle motor-filling station,
just opened after the snow-bound months of winter.  Then five minutes of absolute peace ensued,
except for the buzzing of an investigative bottle-fly before the figure shuffled, stretched,
and raising his head, looked down the road.  From the distance had come the whirring sound
of a motor, the forerunner of a possible customer.  In the hills, an automobile speaks before
it is seen.

Long moments of throbbing echoes; then the car appeared, a mile or so down the cañon, twisting
along the rocky walls which rose sheer from the road, threading the innumerable bridges which
spanned the little stream, at last to break forth into the open country and roar on toward
Dominion.  The drowsy gasoline tender rose.  A moment more and a long, sleek, yellow racer
had come to a stop beside the gas tank, chortled with greater reverberation than ever as the
throttle was thrown open, then wheezed into silence with the cutting off of the ignition. 
A young man rose from his almost flat position in the low-slung driver's seat and crawling
over the side, stretched himself, meanwhile staring upward toward the glaring white of Mount
Taluchen, the highest peak of the continental backbone, frowning in the coldness of snows that
never departed.  The villager moved closer.

"Gas?"

"Yep."  The young man stretched again.  "Fill up the tank--and better give me half a gallon
of oil."

  No stream was near; besides, the cold blast
of the wind, shrilling through the open hood, accomplished the purpose more easily.  Again
a sally and again a stop.  And Barry was thankful, as, huddled and shivering in his light clothing,
he once more sought the radiator.  Vaguely there came to him the thought that he might spend
the night somewhere on the Pass and go on with the flush of morning.  But the thought vanished
as quickly as it came; there was no shelter, no blankets, nothing but the meager warmth of
what fire he might be able to gather, and that would fade the minute he nodded. Already the
temperature had sunk far beneath the freezing point; the crackling of the ice in the gulleys
of the road fairly shouted the fact as he edged back once more from the radiator to his seat.

An hour--and three more after that--with the consequent stops and pauses, the slow turns, the
dragging process up the steeper inclines of the road.  A last final, clattering journey, and
Barry leaped from the seat with something akin to enthusiasm.

Through the swirling snow which sifted past the glare of his headlights, he could discern a
sign which told him he had reached the summit, that he now stood at the literal top of the world.

But it was a silent world, a black world, in which the hills about him were shapeless, dim
hulks, where the wind whined, where the snow swept against his face and drifted down the open
space of his collar; a world of coldness, of malice, of icy venom, where everything was a threatening
thing, and never a cheering aspect except the fact that the grades had been accomplished, and
that from now on he could progress with the knowledge that his engine at least need labor no
longer.  But the dangers!  Barry knew that they had only begun.  The descent would be as steep
as the climb he had just made.  The progress must be slower, if anything, and with the compression
working as a brake.  But it was at least progress, and once more he started.

The engine clanked less now, the air seemed a bit warmer with the down grade, and Barry, in
spite of his fatigue, in spite of the disappointment of a disabled car, felt at least the joy
of having conquered the thing which had sought to hold him back, the happiness of having fought
against obstacles, of having beaten them, and of knowing that he now was on the down trail.
The grade lessened for a few hundred feet, and the machine slowed.  Houston pressed on the
clutch pedal, allowing the car to coast slowly until the hill became steeper again.  Then he
sought once more to shift into gear,--and stopped short!

Those few moments of coasting had been enough.  Overheated, distended, the bearings had cooled
too suddenly about the crank shaft and frozen there with a tightness that neither the grinding
pull of the starter nor the heavy tug of the down grade could loosen.  Once more Barry Houston
felt his heart sink in the realization of a newer, a greater foreboding than ever.  A frozen
crank shaft meant that from now on the gears would be useless.  Fourteen miles of down grade
faced him.  If he were to make them, it must be done with the aid of brakes alone.  That was
dangerous!

He cupped his hands and called,--in the vain hope that the stories of Hazard Pass and its loneliness
might not be true, after all.  But the only answer was the churning of the bank-full stream
a hundred yards away, the thunder of the wind through the pines below, and the eerie echo of
his own voice coming back to him through the snows. Laboriously he left the machine and climbed
back to the summit, there to seek out the little tent house he had seen far at one side and
which he instinctively knew to be the rest room and refreshment stand of the summer season.
But he found it, as he had feared he would find it, a deserted, cold, napping thing, without
a human, without a single comfort, or the possibility of fire or warmth through the night.
Summer, for Hazard Pass, at least, still was a full month away.  For a moment he shivered within
it, staring about its bleak interior by the aid of a flickering match.  Then he went outside
again.  It was only a shell, only a hope that could not be realized.  It would be less of a
hardship to make the fight to reach the bottom of the Pass than to attempt to spend the night
in this flimsy contraption.  In travel there would be at least action, and Barry clambered
down the hill to his machine.

Again he started, the brake bands squeaking and protesting, the machine sloughing dangerously
as now and again its sheer weight forced it forward at dangerous speeds until lesser levels
could be reached and the hold of the brake bands accomplish their purpose again.  Down and
down, the miles slipping away with far greater speed than even Barry realized, until at last--

He grasped desperately for the emergency brake and gripped tight upon it, steering with one
hand.  For five minutes there had come the strong odor of burning rubber; the strain had been
too great, the foot-brake linings were gone; everything depended upon the emergency now!  And
almost with the first strain--

Careening, the car seemed to leap beneath him, a maddened, crazed thing, tired of the hills,
tired of the turmoil and strain of hours of fighting, racing with all the speed that gravity
could thrust upon it for the bottom of the Pass.  The brakes were gone, the emergency had not
even lasted through the first hill.  Barry Houston was now a prisoner of speed,--cramped in
the seat of a runaway car, clutching tight at the wheel, leaning, white, tense-faced, out into
the snow, as he struggled to negotiate the turns, to hold the great piece of runaway machinery
to the crusted road and check its speed from time to time in the snowbanks.

A mile more--halted at intervals by the very thing which an hour or so before Barry Houston
had come almost to hate, the tight-packed banks of snow--then came a new emergency.  One chance
was left, and Barry took it,--the "burring" of the gears in lieu of a brake.  The snow was
fading now, the air was warmer; a mile or so more and he would be safe from that threat which
had driven him down from the mountain peaks,--the possibility of death from exposure, had he,
in his light clothing, attempted to spend the night in the open.  If the burred gears could
only hold the car for a mile or so more--

But a sudden, snapping crackle ended his hope.  The gears had meshed, and meshing, had broken.
Again a wild, careening thing, with no snow banks to break the rush, the car was speeding down
the steepest of the grades like a human thing determined upon self-destruction.

  Was this man a friend, a companion--even an accomplice of the
thin-faced, frost-gnarled Thayer--and had his simple statement been an effort to take Barry
off his guard?  If so, it had not succeeded, for Barry had made no admissions.  But it all
affected him curiously; it nettled him and puzzled him.  For a long time he was silent, merely
staring at the grinning features of Ba'tiste.  At last:

"I should think you would wait until you could consult a doctor before you'd say a thing like
that."

"So?  It has been done."

"And he told you--"

"Nothing.  He does not need to even speak to Ba'teese."  A great chuckle shook the big frame
"Ba'teese know as soon as l' M'sieu Doctaire."

"On good terms, aren't you?  When's he coming again?"

"Parbleu!"  The big man snapped his fingers.  "Peuff!  Like that. Ba'teese call heem, and he
is here."

Houston blinked.  Then, in spite of his aching head, and the pain of the swollen, splint-laced
arm he sat up in bed.

"What kind of--"

"Old Ba'teese, he mus' joke," came quickly and seriously from the other man.  "Ba'teese--he
is heem."

"A doctor?"

Slowly the big man nodded.  Barry went on "I--I--didn't know.  I thought you were just a trapper.
I wondered--"

"So!  That is all--jus' a trapper."

Quietly, slowly, the big man turned away from the bed and stood looking out the window, the
wolf-dog edging close to him as though in companionship and some strange form of sympathy.
There was silence for a long time, then the voice of Ba'tiste came again, but now it was soft
and low, addressed, it seemed, not to the man on the bed, but to vacancy.

"So!  Ba'teese, he is only a trapper now.  Ba'teese, he had swear he never again stand beside
a sick bed.  But you--" and he turned swiftly, a broken smile playing about his lips--"you,
mon ami, you, when I foun' you this morning, with your head twisted under your arm, with the
blood on your face, and the dust and dirt upon you--then you--you look like my Pierre!  And
I pick you up--so!"  He fashioned his arms as though he were holding a baby, "and I look at
you and I say--'Pierre! Pierre!'  But you do not answer--just like he did not answer.  Then
I start back with you, and the way was rough.  I take you under one arm--so.  It was steep.
I must have one arm free.  Then I meet Medaine, and she laugh at me for the way I carry you.
And I was glad. Eet made Ba'teese forget."

"What?"  Barry said it with the curiosity of a boy.  The older man stared hard at the crazy
design of the covers.

"My Pierre," came at last.  "And my Julienne.  Ba'teese, he is all alone now.  Are you all
alone?"  The question came quickly.  Barry answered before he thought.

"Yes."

"Then you know--you know how eet feel.  You know how Ba'teese think when he look out the window.
See?"  He pointed, and Barry raised himself slightly that he might follow the direction of
the gesture. Faintly, through the glass, he could see something white, rearing itself in the
shadows of the heavy pines which fringed the cabin,--a cross.  And it stood as the guardian
of a mound of earth where pine boughs had been placed in smooth precision, while a small vase,
half implanted in the earth, told of flowers in the summer season.  Ba'tiste stared at his
palms.  "Julienne," came at last.  "My wife."  Then, with a sudden impulse, he swerved about
the bed and sat down beside the sick man.  "Ba'teese--" he smiled plaintively--"like to talk
about Pierre--and Julienne.  Even though eet hurt."

Barry could think only in terms of triteness.

"Have they been gone long?"

The big man counted on his fingers.

"One--two--t'ree year.  Before that--bon!"  He kissed his fingers airily.  "Old Ba'teese, he
break the way--long time ago.  He come down from Montreal, with his Julienne and his Pierre--in
his arm, so.  He like to feel big and strong--to help other people.  So, down here where there
were few he came, and built his cabin, with his Pierre and his Julienne.  And, so happy!  Then,
by'm'by, Jacques Robinette come too, with his petite Medaine--"

"That's the girl who was here?"

"Ah, oui.  I am l' M'sieu Doctaire.  I look after the sick for ten--twenty--thirty mile. His latest

Then suddenly he ceased his study of the message and returned it to his pocket.  Two persons
were approaching the cabin from the opposite hill,--a girl whom he was glad to see, and a man
who walked, or rather rolled, in the background: Medaine Robinette and a sort of rear guard
who, twenty or thirty feet behind her, followed her every step, trotted when she ran down the
steep side of an embankment, then slowed as she came to a walk again.  A bow-legged creature
he was, with ill-fitting clothing and a broad "two-gallon" hat which evidently had been bequeathed
to him by some cow-puncher, long hair which straggled over his shoulders, and a beaded vest
which shone out beneath the scraggly outer coat like a candle on a dark night.  Instinctively
Barry knew him to be the grunting individual who had waited outside the door the night before,--Lost
Wing, Medaine's Sioux servant: evidently a self-constituted bodyguard who traveled more as
a shadow than as a human being.  Certainly the girl in the foreground gave no indication that
she was aware of his presence; nor did she seem to care.

Closer she came, and Barry watched her, taking a strange sort of delight in the skipping grace
with which she negotiated the stepping stones of the swollen little stream which intervened
between her and the cabin of Ba'tiste Renaud, then clambered over the straggling pile of massed
logs and dead timber which strewed the small stretch of flat before the rise began, leading
to where he rested.  More like some graceful, agile boy was she than a girl.  Her clothing
was of that type which has all too soon taken the place of the buckskin in the West,--a riding
habit, with stout little shoes and leather puttees; her hair was drawn tight upon her head
and encased in the shielding confines of a cap, worn low over her forehead, the visor pulled
aside by a jutting twig and now slanting out at a rakish angle; her arms full of something
pink and soft and pretty.  Barry wondered what it could be,--then brightened with sudden hope.

"Wonder if she's bringing them to me?"

The answer came a moment later as she faced him, panting slightly from the exertion of the
climb, the natural flush of exercise heightened by her evident embarrassment.

"Oh, you're up!" came in an almost disappointed manner.  Then with a glance toward the great
cluster of wild roses in her arms, "I don't know what to do with these things now."

"Why?"  Barry's embarrassment was as great as hers.  "If--if it'll do any good, I'll climb
back into bed again."

"No--don't.  Only I thought you were really, terribly ill and--"

"I am--I was--I will be.  That is--gosh, it's a shame for you to go out and pick all those
and then have me sitting up here as strong as an ox. I--"

"Oh, don't worry about that."  She smiled at him with that sweetness which only a woman can
know when she has the advantage.  "I didn't pick them.  Lost Wing"--she pointed to the skulking,
outlandishly dressed Indian in the background--"attended to that.  I was going to send them
over by him.  But I didn't have anything to do, so I just thought I'd bring them myself."

"Thanks for that, anyway.  Can't I keep them just the same--to put on the table or something?"

"Oh, if you care to."  Barry felt that she was truly disappointed that he wasn't at the point
of death, or at least somewhere near it. "Where's Ba'tiste."

"Out looking after his traps, picking them up I think, for the summer. He'll be back soon.
Is there--"

"No.  I usually come over every day to see him, you know."  Then the blue eyes lost their diffidence
to become serious.  "Do you remember yet who you are?"

"Less right at this minute than at any other time!" spoke Barry truthfully.  "I'm out of my
head entirely!"  He reached for the flowers.

"Please don't joke that way.  It's really serious.  When I was across--army nursing--I saw
a lot of just such cases as yours.  Shell shock, you know.  One has to be awfully careful with it."

"I know.  But I'm getting the best of care.  I--ouch!"  His interest had exceeded his caution.
The unbandaged hand had waved the flowers for emphasis and absently gripped the stems.  The
wild roses fluttered to the ground.  "Gosh!" came dolefully, "I'm all full of thorns.  Guess
I'll have to pick 'em out with my teeth."

"Oh!"  Then she picked up the roses and laid them gingerly aside.  "You can't use your other
hand, can you?"

"No.  Arm's broken."

"Then--" she looked back toward Lost Wing, hunched on a stump, and Barry's heart sank.  She
debated a moment, at last to shake her head. "No--he'd want to dig them out with a knife. 
If you don't mind."  She moved toward Houston and Barry thrust forth his hand.

"If you don't mind," he countered and she sat beside him.  A moment later:

"I must look like a fortune teller."

"See anything in my palm besides thorns?"

"Yes.  A little dirt.  Ba'tiste evidently isn't a very good nurse."

"I did the best I could with one hand.  But I was pretty grimy.  I--I didn't know," and Barry
grinned cheerfully, "I was going to be this lucky."

She pretended not to hear the sally.  And in some way Barry was glad. He much rather would
have her silent than making some flippant remark, much rather would he prefer to lean comfortably
back on the old bench and watch the quiet, almost childish determination of her features as
she sought for a grip on the tiny protuberances of the thorns, the soft brownness of the few
strands of hair which strayed from beneath the boyish cap, the healthy glow of her complexion,
the smallness of the clear-skinned hands, the daintiness of the trim little figure.  Much rather
would he be silent with the picture than striving for answers to questions that in their very
naïveness were an accusation.  Quite suddenly Barry felt cheap and mean and dishonest.  He
felt that he would like to talk about himself,--about home and his reasons for being out here;
his hopes for the mill which now was a shambling, unprofitable thing; about the future and--a
great many things.  It was with an effort, when she queried him again concerning his memory,
that he still remained Mr. Nobody.  Then he shifted the conversation from himself to her.

"Do you live out here?"

"Yes.  Didn't Ba'tiste tell you?  My house is just over the hill--you can just see one edge
of the roof through that bent aspen."

Barry stared.

"I'd noticed that.  Thought it was a house, but couldn't be sure.  I thought I understood Ba'tiste
to say you only came out here in the summer."

"I did that when I was going to school.  Now I stay here all the year 'round."

"Isn't it lonely?"

"Out here?  With a hundred kinds of birds to keep things going? -- and 1839 him expose the feet

"That is all."

"Then where--"

But again Ba'tiste shrugged his shoulders.  Then he pulled long at his grizzled beard, regarding
the wolf-dog which sat between his legs, staring up at him.

"Golemar," came at last.  "There is something strange.  Peuff!  We shall fin' out, you and

"Good?  Why?"

"What you know about lumber?"

Houston shook his head.

"A lot less than I should.  It wasn't my business, you know.  My father started this mill out
here during boom times, when it looked as though the railroad over Crestline would make the
distance between Denver and Salt Lake so short that the country would build up like wild fire.
He got them to put in a switch from above Tabernacle to the mill and figured on making a lot
of money out of it all.  But it didn't pan out, Ba'tiste.  First of all, the railroad didn't
go to Salt Lake and in the second--"

"The new road will," said the French-Canadian.  "Peuff!  When they start to build eet, blooey!
Eet will be no time."

"The new road?  I didn't know there was to be one."

"Ah, oui, oui, oui!"  Ba'tiste became enthusiastic.  "They shall make eet a road!  Eet will
not wind over the range like this one.  Eet shall come through the mountains with a six-mile
tunnel, at Carrow Peak where they have work already one, two, t'ree year.  Then eet will start

"When the railroad, eet is ready, and the tunnel, eet is done.  When that shall be?  No one
know.  But the survey, eet is made.  The land, eet is condem'.  So it must be soon.  But you
say you no know lumber?"

"Not more than any office man could learn in a year and a half.  It wasn't my business, Ba'tiste.
Father thought less and less of the mill every year.  Once or twice, he was all but ready to
sell it to Thayer, and would have done it, I guess, if Thayer could have raised the money.
He was sick of the thing and wanted to get rid of it.  I had gone into the real estate business,
never dreaming but that some day the mill would be sold and off our hands.  Then--then my trouble
came along, and my father--left this will.  Since then, I've been busy trying to stir up business.
Oh, I guess I could tell a weathered scantling from a green one, and a long time ago, when
I was out here, my father taught me how to scale a log.  That's about all."

"Could you tell if a man cut a tree to get the greatest footage?  If you should say to a lumberjack
to fell a tree at the spring of the root, would you know whether he did it or not?  Heh?  Could
you know if the sawyer robbed you of fifty feet on ever' log?  No?  Then we shall learn. Of assets in the schoolhouse

"Simple, isn't it?" he asked caustically.  "Whenever it's necessary for an 'accident' to happen,
merely send out into the woods for a load of timber from a certain place."

"Then the iron hunter--the man who look for metal in the wood--he look some other place.  Beside,"
and Ba'tiste looked almost admiringly at a spike-filled tree.  "Eet is a good job.  The spike,
they are driven deep in the wood, they are punched away in, so the bark, eet will close over
them.  If the iron hunter is not, what-you-say, full of pepper, and if he is lazy, then he
not find heem, whether he want to or not. M'sieu Thayer, he have a head on him."

"Then Thayer--"

"Why not?"

"But why?  He was the only man on the job out here.  He didn't have to fill a whole section
of a forest full of spikes when he wanted to break a saw or cause me trouble."

"Ah, no.  But M'sieu--that is, whoever did eet--maybe he figure on the time when you yourself
try to run the mill.  Eh?"

"Well, if he did," came sharply, "he's figured on this exact moment. I've seen enough, Ba'tiste.
I'm going to Denver and contract myself an entirely new crew.  Then I'm coming back to drop
this masquerade I've been carrying on--and if you'll help me--run this place myself. Thayer's
out--from the minute I can get a new outfit.  I'm not going to take any chances.  When he goes,
the whole bunch here goes with him!"

"Ah, oui!"  Ba'tiste grinned with enthusiasm.  "You said a what-you-say--large bite!  Now,"
he walked toward the saw, "we shall fell a tree that shall not split."

"If you don't mind, I'd rather go back and look around the place.  I want to get lined up on
everything before I start to Denver."

"Ah, oui."  Together, led by the wolf-dog, they made their way to the wagon again, once more
to skirt the lake and to start down the narrow roadway leading beside the flume.  A half-hour
more and there came the sound of hammers and of saws.  They stopped, and staring through the
scraggly trees, made out the figures of half a dozen men busily at work upon the erection of
a low, rambling building.  All about them were vast piles of lumber, two-by-fours, scantlings,
boardings, shingles,--everything that possibly could be needed in the building of not one,
but many structures.  Ba'tiste nodded.

"The new mill."

"Yes.  Probably being built out of my lumber.  It's a cinch they didn't transport it all the
way from Tabernacle."

"Nor pay M'sieu Houston.  Many things can happen when one is the manager."

Barry made no answer.  For another mile they drove in silence, at last to come into the clearing
of Barry's mill, with its bunk house, its cook house, its diminutive commissary, its mill and
kilns and sheds. Houston leaped from the wagon to start a census and to begin his preparations
for a cleaning-out of the whole establishment.  But at the door of the commissary he whirled,
staring.  A buggy was just coming over the brow of the little hill which led to the mill property.
Some one had called to him,---a woman whose voice had caused him to start, then, a second later,
to go running forward.

She was beside Thayer in the buggy, leaning forth, one hand extended as Barry hurried toward
her, her black eyes flashing eagerness, her full, yet cold lips parted, her olive-skinned cheeks
enlivened by a flush of excitement as Houston came to her, forgetful of the sneer of the man
at her side, forgetful of the staring Ba'tiste in the background, forgetful of his masquerade,
of everything.

"Agnes!" he gasped.  "Why did you--"

"I thought--" and the drawling voice of Fred Thayer had a suddenly sobering effect on Houston,
"that you weren't hurt very bad.  Your memory came back awful quick, didn't it?  I thought
she'd bring you to your senses!"

CHAPTER IX

to him and he assisted her to the ground.

It was a question which haunted him during the days in which he cut into his bank account with
the purchase of the bare necessities of a sawmill.  It was a question which followed him back
to Tabernacle, thence across country to camp.  But it was one that was not to be answered.
Things had happened again.

Ba'tiste was not at the mill, where new foundations had appeared in Houston's absence.  A workman
pointed vaguely upward, and Barry hurried on toward the lake, clambering up the hill nearest
the clearing, that he might take the higher and shorter road.

He found no Ba'tiste but there was something else which held Houston's interest for a moment
and which stopped him, staring wonderingly into the distance.  A new skidway had made its appearance
on the side of the jutting mountain nearest the dam.  Logs were tumbling downward in slow,
but steady succession, to disappear, then to show themselves, bobbing jerkily outward toward
the center of the lake.  That skidway had not been there before.  Certainly, work at the mill
had not progressed to such an extent that Ba'tiste could afford to start cutting timber already.
Houston turned back toward the lower camp road, wondering vaguely what it all could mean, striving
to figure why Ba'tiste should have turned to logging operations instead of continuing to stress
every workman's ability on the rebuilding of the burned structure.  A mile he went--two--then
halted.

A thunderous voice was booming belligerently from the distance:

"You lie--un'stan'?  Ba'teese say you lie--if you no like eet, jus'--what-you-say--climb up
me!  Un'stan'?  Climb up me!"

Houston broke into a run, racing along the flume with constantly increasing speed as he heard
outburst after outburst from the giant trapper, interjected by the lesser sounds of argumentative
voices in reply.  Faintly he heard a woman's voice, then Ba'tiste's in sudden command:

"Go on--you no belong here.  Ba'tiste, he handle this.  Go 'long!"

Faster than ever went Barry Houston, at last to make the turn of the road as it followed the
flume, and to stop, breathless, just in time to escape colliding with the broad back of the
gigantic Canadian, squared as he was, half across the road.  Facing him were five men with
shovels and hammers, workmen of the Blackburn camp, interrupted evidently in the building of
some sort of contraption which led away into the woods. Houston looked more closely, then gasped.
It was another flume; they were making a connection with his own; already water had been diverted
from the main flume and was flowing down the newly boarded conduit which led to the Blackburn
mill.  A lunge and he had taken his place beside Renaud.

"What's this mean?" he demanded angrily, to hear his words echoed by the booming voice of his
big companion:

"Ah, oui!  Yes--what this mean?  Huh?"

The foreman looked up caustically.

"I've told you about ten times," he answered, addressing himself to Ba'tiste.  "We're building
a connection on our flume."

"Our flume?"  Houston gasped the words.  "Where do you get that 'our' idea?  I own this flume
and this lake and this flume site--"

"If your name's Houston, I guess you do," came the answer.  "But if you can read and write,
you ought to know that while you may own it, you don't use it.  That's our privilege from now
on, in cold black and white.  As far as the law is concerned, this is our flume, and our water,
and our lake, and our woods back there.  And we're going to use all of 'em, as much as we please--and
it's your business to stay out of our way!"

CHAPTER XI

The statement took Houston off his feet for a moment; but recovery came just as quickly, a
recoil with the red splotches of anger blazing before his eyes, the surge of hot blood sweeping
through his veins, the heat of conflict in his brain.  His good hand clenched.  A leap and
he had struck the foreman on the point of the chin, sending him reeling backward, while the
other men rushed to his assistance.

"That's my answer to you!" shouted Houston.  "This is my flume and--"

"Run tell Thayer!" shouted the foreman, and then with recovering strength, he turned for a
cant hook.  But Ba'tiste seized it first, and with a great wrench, threw it far out of the
way.  Then, like some great, human trip hammer, he swung into action, spinning Houston out
of the way as he went forward, his big fists churning, his voice bellowing his call of battle:

"Climb up me!  Climb up me!"

The foreman stooped for a club,--and rose just in time to be lifted even higher, at the point
of Ba'tiste's right fist then to drop in a lump.  Then they were all about him, seeking for
an opening, fists pounding, heavy shoes kicking at shins, while in the rear, Houston, scrambling
around with his one arm, almost happy with the enthusiasm of battle, swung hard and often at
every opportunity, then swerved and covered until he could bring his fist into action again.

The fight grew more intense with a last spurt, then died out, as Ba'tiste, seizing the smallest
of the men, lifted him bodily and swinging him much after the fashion of a sack of meal, literally
used him as a battering ram against the rest of the attacking forces.  For a last time, Houston
hit a skirmisher and was hit in return. In 1863 to-- them was voice Man (posteriorly had been integrate over

"Then she'll straighten things out, Ba'tiste.  I'm glad of it.  She knows the truth about this

"Oui.  Ba'teese tell her--about the flume and M'sieu Thayer, what he say.  But Ba'teese--"

"What?"

The trapper was silent a moment.  At last:

"You like her, eh?"

"Medaine?"

"No--the other."

"A great deal, Ba'teese.  She has meant everything to me; she was my one friend when I was
in trouble.  She even went on the stand and testified for me.  What were you going to say?"

"Nothing," came the enigmatical reply.  "Ba'teese will wait here.  You go Boston to-night?"

"Yes."

And that night, in the moonlight, behind the rushing engine of a motor car, Barry Houston once
more rode the heights where Mount Taluchen frowned down from its snowy pinnacles, where the
road was narrow and the turns sharp, and where the world beneath was built upon a scale of
miniature.  But this time, the drifts had faded from beside the highway; nodding flowers showed
in the moonlight; the snow flurries were gone.  Soon the downward grade had come and after
that the straggling little town of Dominion.  Early morning found Houston in Denver, searching
the train schedules.  That night he was far from the mountains, hurrying half across the continent
in search of the thing that would give him back his birthright.

Weazened, wrinkle-faced little Jenkins met him at the office, to stare in apparent surprise,
then to rush forward with well-simulated enthusiasm.

"You're back, Mr. Houston!  I'm so glad.  I didn't know whether to send the notice out to you
in Colorado, or wire you.  It just came yesterday."

"The notice?  Of what?"

"The M. P. & S. L. call for bids.  You've heard about it."

But Houston shook his head.  Jenkins stared.

"I thought you had.  The Mountain, Plains and Salt Lake Railroad.  I thought you knew all about
it."

"The one that's tunneling Carrow Peak?  I've heard about the road, but I didn't know they were
ready for bids for the western side of the mountain yet.  Where's the notice?"

"Right on your desk, sir."

Abstractedly, Houston picked it up and glanced at the specifications,--for railroad ties by
the million, for lumber, lathes, station-house material, bridge timbers, and the thousands
of other lumber items that go into the making of a road.  Hastily he scanned the printed lines,
only at last to place it despondently in a pocket.

"Millions of dollars," he murmured.  "Millions--for somebody!"

And Houston could not help feeling that it was for the one man he hated, Fred Thayer.  The
specifications called for freight on board at the spurs at Tabernacle, evidently soon to have
competition in the way of railroad lines.  And Tabernacle meant just one thing, the output
of a mill which could afford to put that lumber at the given point cheaper then any other.
The nearest other camp was either a hundred miles away, on the western side, or so far removed
over the range in the matter of altitude that the freight rates would be prohibitive to a cheaper
bid.  Thayer, with his ill-gotten flume, with his lake, with his right to denude Barry Houston's
forests at an insignificant cost, could out-bid the others.  He would land the contract, unless--

  He followed me a block or so, taunting me with his
superior strength and cursing me as the son of a man whom he intended to make bow to his every
wish.  I ran then and, evading him, went home and to bed.  About four o'clock in the morning,
I was awakened by the police.  They had found Tom Langdon dead, with his skull crushed, evidently
by the blow of a club or a hammer.  They said I did it."

A slight gasp traveled over the lips of Medaine, still by the window. Ba'tiste, his features
old and lined, reached out with one big hand and patted the man on the shoulder.  Then for
a long time, there was silence.

"Eet is the lie, eh?"

"Ba'tiste," Houston turned appealingly to him "as I live, that's all I know.  I never saw Langdon
after he took that mallet from me.  Some one killed him, evidently while he was wandering around,
looking for me. The mallet dropped by his side.  It had blood on it--and they accused me. 
It looked right--there was every form of circumstantial evidence against me.  And," the breath
pulled hard, "what was worse, everybody believed that I killed him.  Even my best friends--even
my father."

"Ba'teese no believe it."

"Why?"  Houston turned to him in hope,--in the glimmering chance that perhaps there was something
in the train of circumstances that would have prevented the actuality of guilt.  But the answer,
while it cheered him, was rather disconcerting.

"You look like my Pierre.  Pierre, he could do no wrong.  You look like heem."

It was sufficient for the old French-Canadian.  But Houston knew it could carry but little
weight with the girl by the window.  He went on:

"Only one shred of evidence was presented in my behalf.  It was by a woman who had worked for
about six months for my father,--Miss Jierdon. She testified to having passed in a taxicab
just at the end of our quarrel, and that, while it was true that there was evidence of a struggle,
Langdon had the mallet.  She was my only witness, besides the experts.  But it may help here,
Miss Robinette."

It was the first time he had addressed her directly and she turned, half in surprise.

"How," she asked the question as though with an effort, "how were you cleared?"

"Through expert medical testimony that the blow which killed Langdon could not have been struck
with that mallet.  The whole trial hinged on the experts.  The jury didn't believe much of
either side.  They couldn't decide absolutely that I had killed Langdon.  And so they acquitted
me.  I'm trying to tell you the truth, without any veneer to my advantage."

"Bon!  Good!  Eet is best."

"Miss Jierdon is the same one who is out here?"

"Yes."

"She testified in your behalf?"

"Yes.  And Miss Robinette, if you'll only talk to her--if you'll only ask her about it, she'll
tell you the story exactly as I've told it. She trusted me; she was the only bright spot in
all the blackness.  I may not be able to convince you--but she could, Miss Robinette.  If you'll
only--"

"Would you guarantee the truth of anything she should tell me?"

"Absolutely."

"Even if she told hidden things?"

"Hidden?  I don't know what you mean.  There's nothing to be hidden. What she tells you will
be the truth, the whole truth, the absolute truth."

"I'm--I'm sorry."  She turned again to the window.  Houston went forward.

"Sorry?  Why?  There's nothing--"

"Miss Jierdon has told me," came in a strained voice, "things that perhaps you did not mean
for her to tell."

"I?  Why, I--"

"That she did pass as you were struggling.  That she saw the blow struck--and that it was you
who struck it."

"Miss Robinette!"

"That further, you confessed to her and told her why you had killed Langdon--because he had
discovered something in your own father's life that would serve as blackmail. Very Mister. Jones

A moment more and they were driving away, Ba'tiste humped over the reins as usual, Houston
striving to put from him the agony of the new accusation. Finally, the trapper cocked his head
and spoke, rather to the horse and Golemar than to Houston.

"Eet is the one, big lie!"

"Yes, but there's not much way of proving it, Ba'tiste."

"Proof?  Bah!  And does Ba'teese need proof?  Ba'teese no like this woman, Jierdon.  She say
Ba'teese burn the mill."

"I didn't know you heard that."

"She have a bad mouth.  She have a bad eye.  She have a bad tongue. Yes, oui!  She have a bad
tongue!"

"Let's wait, Ba'tiste.  There may be some mistake about it.  Of course, it's possible.  She
had worked for my father for six months at the time--she could have been placed there for a
purpose.  Her testimony was of the sort that the jury could take either as for me or against
me; she established, as an eyewitness, that we had quarreled and that the mallet played a part
in it.  Naturally, though, I looked to her as my friend.  I thought that her testimony helped me."

"And the taxi-driver?  What did he say?  Eh?"

"We never were able to find him."

"Oh, ho!  Golemar!  You hear?"  The old trapper's voice was stinging with sarcasm.  "They nev'
fin' heem.  But the woman she was in a taxi. Ah, oui.  She could pass, just at the moment.
She could put in the mind of the jury the fact that there was a quarrel, while she preten'
to help M'sieu Houston.  But the taxi-driver--no, they nev' fin' heem!"

"Let's wait, Ba'tiste."

"Oh--ah, oui."

On they drove in silence, talking of trivial things, each fencing away from the subject that
was on their minds and from mention of the unfortunate interview with Medaine Robinette.  The
miles faded slowly, at last to bring the camp into view.  Ten minutes later, Houston leaped
from the buggy and knocked at the door of the cottage.

"I want to see Miss Jierdon," he told the cook who had opened the door. That person shook her head.

"She's gone."

"Gone?  Where?"

"To town, I guess.  She came back here from Miss Robinette's last night and packed her things
and left.  She didn't say where she was going. She left a note for you."

"Let me have it!"  There was anxiety in the command.  The cook bustled back into the house,
to return with a sealed envelope addressed to Houston.  He slit it with a trembling finger.

"What she say?"  Ba'tiste was leaning from the buggy.  Houston took his place beside him, and
as the horse was turned back toward the trapper's cabin, read aloud:

"Dearest Barry:

"Hate awfully to run away like this without seeing you, but it can't be helped.  Have an offer
of a position in St. Louis that I can't very well refuse.  Will write you from there.

"Love and kisses.

  "AGNES."

Ba'tiste slapped the reins on the horse's back.

"She is like the Judas, eh?" he asked quietly, and Houston cringed with the realization that
he had spoken the truth.  Judas!  A feminine Judas, who had come to him when his guard had
been lowered, who had pretended that she believed in him, that she even loved him, that she
might wreck his every plan and hope in life.  A Judas, a--

"Let's don't talk about it, Ba'tiste!" Houston's voice was hoarse, weary.  "It's a little too
much to take, all in one day."

"Tres bien," answered the old French-Canadian, not to speak again until they had reached his
cabin and, red-faced, he had turned from the stove to place the evening meal on the table.
Then, his mouth full of crisply fried bacon, he waved a hand and spluttered with a sudden inspiration:

"What you do, now?"

"Queer question, isn't it?"  The grim humor of it brought a smile, in spite of the lead in
Houston's heart.  "What is there to do?"

"What?"  Ba'tiste gulped his food, rose and waved a hand with a sudden flash of emphasis. 
"Peuff!  And there is ever'thin'.  You have a mill."

"Such as it is."

"But eet is a mill.  And eet can saw timber--enough to keep the wolf from the door.  You have
yourself.  Your arm, he is near' well.  And there is alway'--" he gestured profoundly--"the
future.  He is like a woman, the future," he added, with a little smile.  "He always look good
when he is in the far away."

The enthusiasm of the trapper found a faint echo in Houston's heart. "I'm not whipped yet,
Ba'tiste.  But I'm near it.  I've had some pretty hard knocks."

"Ah, oui! Something will i went but slight, and name through ruination were the Persecutor, to which am

Coldly, dispassionately, now that it was done, that the word of the Empire Lake Mill and Lumber
Company had been given to deliver the materials for the making of a great railroad, had guaranteed
its resources and furnished the necessary bond for the fulfillment of a promise, Barry Houston
could not help but feel that it all had been rash, to say the least.  Where was the machinery
to be obtained?  Where the money to keep things going?  True, there would be spot cash awaiting
the delivery of every installment of the huge order, enough, in fact, to furnish the necessary
running expenses of a mill under ordinary circumstances.  But the circumstances which surrounded
the workings of the Empire Lake project were far from ordinary.  No easy skidways to a lake,
no flume, no aerials; there was nothing to cut expenses.  Unless a miracle should happen, and
Houston reflected that miracles were few and far between, that timber must be brought to the
mill by a system that would be disastrous as far as costs were concerned.  Yet, the contract
had been made!

He wandered the aisle of the sleeper, fidgeting from one end to the other, as neither magazines,
nor the spinning scenery without held a counter-attraction for his gloomy thoughts.  When night
at last came, he entered the smoking compartment and slumped into a seat in a far corner, smoking
in a detached manner, often pulling on his cigar long after lengthy minutes of reflection had
allowed its ashes to cool.

About him the usual conversation raged, the settling of a nation's problems, the discussion
of crime waves, Bolshevism and the whatnot that goes with an hour of smoking on a tiresome
journey.  From Washington and governmental affairs, it veered to the West and dry farming,
thence to the cattle business; to anecdotes, and finally to ghost stories.  And then, with
a sudden interest, Houston forgot his own problems to listen attentively, tensely, almost fearfully.
A man whom he never before had seen, and whom he probably never would see again, was talking,--about
something which might be as remote to Houston as the poles.  Yet it held him, it fascinated,
it gripped him!

"Speaking of gruesome things," the talker had said, "reminds me.  I'm a doctor--not quite full
fledged, I'll admit, but with the right to put M. D. after my name.  Spent a couple of years
as an interne in Bellstrand Hospital in New York.  Big place.  Any of you ever been there?"

No one had.  The young doctor went on.

"Quite a place for experiments.  They've got a big room on the fifth floor where somebody is
always dissecting, or carrying out some kind of investigations into this bodily thing we call
a home.  My work led me past there a good deal, and I'd gotten so I hardly noticed it.  But
one Sunday night, I guess it was along toward midnight, I saw something that brought me up
short.  I happened to look in and saw a man in there, murdering another one with a wooden mallet."

"Murdering him?"  The statement had caused a rise from the rest of the auditors.  The doctor
laughed.

"Well, perhaps I used too sentimental a phrase.  I should have said, acting out a murder. 
You can't very well murder a dead man.  The fellow he was killing already was a corpse.

"You mean--"

"Just what I'm saying.  There were two or three assistants.  Pretty big doctors, I learned
later, all of them from Boston.  They had taken a cadaver from the refrigerator and stood it
in a certain position.  Then the one man had struck it on the head with the mallet with all
the force he could summon.  Of course it knocked the corpse down--I'm telling you, it was gruesome,
even to an interne!  The last I saw of them, the doctors were working with their microscopes--evidently
to see what effect the blow had produced."

"What was the idea?"

"Never found out.  They're pretty close-mouthed about that sort of thing. You see, opposite
sides in a trial are always carrying out experiments and trying their level best to keep the
other fellow from knowing what's going on.  I found out later that the door was supposed to
have been locked.  I passed through about ten minutes later and saw them working on another
human body--evidently one of a number that they had been trying the tests on.  About that time
some one heard me and came out like a bullet.  The next thing I knew, everything was closed.
How long the experiments had been going on, I couldn't say.  I do know, however, that they
didn't leave there until about three o'clock in the morning."

"You--you don't know who the men were?"  Houston, forcing himself to be casual, had asked the
question.  The young doctor shook his head.

"No--except that they were from Boston.  At least, the doctors were.  One of the nurses knew
them.  I suppose the other man was a district attorney--they usually are around somewhere during
an experiment."

"You never learned with what murder case it was connected?"

"No--the fact is, it passed pretty much out of my mind, as far as the details were concerned.
Although I'll never forget the picture."

"Why?  Simply because I figured they would make the best witnesses."

"It couldn't have been," and Houston's voice was more coldly caustic than ever, "that it was
because they would be willing to perjure themselves, while the real doctors wouldn't?"

"Of course not!  This whole thing is silly.  Besides, I'm out of it entirely.  I'm--"

"Mr. Worthington," and Houston's tone changed.  "Your manner and your words indicate very plainly
that you're not out of it--that you merely wish you were.  Isn't that the truth?  Don't you?"

"Well," and the man lit a fresh cigarette, "I feel that way about every murder case."

"But especially about this one.  You're not naturally a persecutor. You don't naturally want
to railroad men to the penitentiary.  And I believe that, as a general thing, you didn't do
it.  You tried it in my case; election was coming on, you had just run up against two or three
acquittals, and you had made up your mind that in my case you were going to run the gauntlet
to get a conviction.  I don't believe you wanted to send me up simply for the joy of seeing
an innocent man confined in prison.  You wanted a conviction--wasn't that it?"

"Every prosecutor works for that."

"Not when he knows the man is innocent, Mr. Worthington.  You knew that--I have proof.  I have
evidence that you found it out almost at the beginning of my trial--August second, to be exact--and
that you used this information to your own ends.  In other words, it told you what the defense
would testify; and you built up, with your professional experts, a wall to combat it.  Now,
isn't that the truth?"

"Why--"  The former district attorney took more time than usual to knock the ashes from his
cigarette, then suddenly changed the subject.

"You spoke of a suit you might bring when you came in here?"

"Yes.  Against the city.  I have a perfect one.  I was persecuted when the official in charge
of the case knew that I was not guilty.  To that end I can call the three doctors I've mentioned
and put them on the stand and ask them why they did not testify in the case.  I also can call
the officials of Bellstrand Hospital in New York where you conducted certain experiments on
cadavers on the night of August second; also a doctor who saw you working in there and who
watched you personally strike the blows with a mallet; further, I can produce the records of
the hospital which state that you were there, give the names of the entire party, together
with the number of corpses experimented upon.  Is that sufficient evidence that I know what
I'm talking about?"

Worthington examined his cigarette again.

"I suppose it's on the books down there.  But there's nothing to state of what the experiments
consisted."

"I have just told you that I have an eye-witness.  Further, there are the three doctors."

"Have you seen them?"

Houston thought quickly.  It was his only chance.

"I know exactly what their testimony will be."

"You've made arrangements for your suit then."  Worthington's color had changed.  Houston noticed
that the hand which held the cigarette trembled slightly.

"No, I haven't.  I'm not here to browbeat you, Mr. Worthington, or lie to you.  It came to
me simply as a ruse to get in to see you.  But the more I think of it, the more I know that

He turned to the key and hammered doggedly.  Only soggy deadness answered.  He tested his plugs
and tried again.  In vain.  An hour later, he still was there, fighting for the impossible,
striving to gain an answer from vacancy, struggling to instil life into a thing deadened by
ice, and drifts, and wind, and broken, sagging telegraph poles.  The line was gone!

CHAPTER XIX

Until dusk they remained in the boxlike station, hoping against hope. But the whine and snarl
of the wind were the only sounds that came to them, the steady banking of the snow against
the windows the only evidence of life.  The telegraph line, somewhere between Tabernacle and
the country which lay over the bleak, now deadly range, was a shattered thing, with poles buried
in drifts, with loose strands of wire swinging in the gusts of the blizzard, with ice coated
upon the insulations, and repair--until the sun should come and the snows melt--an almost impossible
task.

"It'd take a guy with a diving suit to find some of them wires, I guess," the operator hazarded,
as he finally ceased his efforts and reached for his coat and hat and snowshoes.  "There ain't
no use staying here.  You fellows are going to sleep in town to-night, ain't you?"

There was little else to do.  They fought their way to the rambling boarding house, there to
join the loafing group in what passed for a lobby and to watch with them the lingering death
of day in a shroud of white.  Night brought no cessation of the wind, no lessening of the banks
of snow which now were drifting high against the first-story windows; the door was only kept
in working order through constant sallies of the bent old boarding-house keeper, with his snow
shovel.

Windows banged and rattled, with a muffled, eerie sound; snow sifted through the tiniest cracks,
spraying upon those who sat near them.  The old cannon-ball stove, crammed with coal, reached
the point where dull red spots enlivened its bulging belly; yet the big room was cold with
non-detectable drafts, the men shivered in spite of their heavy clothing, and the region outside
the immediate radius of the heater was barn-like with frigidity.  Midnight came, and the group
about the stove slept in their chairs, rather than undergo the discomfort and coldness of bed.

Morning brought no relief.  The storm was worse, if anything, and the boarding-house keeper
faced drifts waist high at the doorway with his first shoveling expedition of the day. In Phenicia, and

  Discouraged,
half-beaten, he tried again, only to wander farther than ever from the trail.  Dawn found him
at last, floundering hopelessly in snow-screened woods, going on toward he knew not where.

A half-hour, then he stopped.  Fifty feet away, almost covered by the changing snows, a small
cabin showed faintly, as though struggling to free itself from the bonds of white, and Houston
turned toward it eagerly.  His numbed hands banged at the door, but there came no answer. 
He shouted; still no sound came from within, and he turned the creaking, protesting knob.

The door yielded, and climbing over the pile of snow at the step, Houston guided his snowshoes
through the narrow door, blinking in the half-light in an effort to see about him.  There was
a stove, but the fire was dead.  At the one little window, the curtain was drawn tight and
pinned at the sides to the sash.  There was a bed--and the form of some one beneath the covers.
Houston called again, but still there came no answer.  He turned to the window, and ripping
the shade from its fastenings, once more sought the bed, to bend over and to stare in dazed,
bewildered fashion, as though in a dream.  He was looking into the drawn, haggard features
of an unconscious woman, the eyes half-open, yet unseeing, one emaciated hand grasped about
something that was shielded by the covers.  Houston forced himself even closer. He touched
the hand.  He called:

"Agnes!"

The eyelids moved slightly; it was the only evidence of life, save the labored, irregular breathing.
Then the hand moved, clutchingly. Slowly, tremblingly, Houston turned back an edge of the blankets,--and
stood aghast.

On her breast was a baby--dead!

CHAPTER XX

There was no time for conjectures.  The woman meant a human life,--in deadly need of resuscitation,
and Barry leaped to his task.

Warmth was the first consideration, and he hurried to the sheet-iron stove, with its pile of
wood stacked behind, noticing, as he built the fire, cans and packages of provisions upon the
shelf over the small wooden table, evidence that some one other than the woman herself had
looked after the details of stocking the cabin with food and of providing against emergencies.
At least a portion of the wood as he shoved it into the stove crackled and spit with the wetness
of snow; the box had been replenished, evidently within the last few days.

Soon water was boiling.  Hot cloths went to the woman's head; quietly, reverently, Barry had
taken the still, small child from the tightly clenched arm and covered it, on the little table.
And with the touch of the small, lifeless form, the resentment which had smoldered in Houston's
heart for months seemed to disappear.  Instinctively he knew what a baby means to a mother,--and
she must be its mother.  He understood that the agony of loss which was hers was far greater
even than the agony which her faithlessness had meant for him.  Gently, almost tenderly, he
went again to the bed, to chafe the cold, thin wrists, to watch anxiously the eyes, then at
last to bend forward.  The woman was looking at him, staring with fright in her gaze, almost
terror.

"Barry--" the word was more of a mumble.  "Barry--" then the eyes turned, searching for the
form that no longer was beside her. "My--my--"  Then, with a spasm of realization, she was
silent.  Houston strove dully for words.

"I'm sorry--Agnes.  Don't be afraid of me.  I'll get help for you."

"Don't."  The voice was a monotone, minus expression, almost minus life.  The face had become
blank, so much parchment drawn over bone. "I've been sick--my baby--where's my baby?"

"Don't you know?"

"Yes," came at last.  There was the dullness that comes when grief has reached the breaking
point.  "Dead.  It died--yesterday morning."

Houston could say nothing in answer.  The simple statement was too tragic, too full of meaning,
too fraught with the agony of that long day and night of suffering, for any reply in words
that would not jar, or cause even a greater pang.  Quietly he turned to the stove, red-hot
now, and with snow water began the making of gruel from the supplies on the shelf.  Once he
turned, suddenly aware that the eyes of the woman were centered in his direction.  But they
were not upon him; their gaze was for one thing, one alone,--that tiny, covered form on the table.

An hour passed silently, except for the trivialities of speech accompanying the proffered food.
Then, at last, forcing himself to the subject, Houston asked a question:

"Where is he?"

"Who?"  Sudden fright had come into the woman's eyes.  A name formed on Houston's lips, only
to be forced back into the more general query:

"Your husband."

She smiled faintly.

"You've got me, haven't you, Barry?"  A half-hysterical tone came now. "You know a lot--and
you want the rest, so you can pay me back, don't you?  Oh," and the thin fingers plucked at
the bedclothes, "I expected it!  I expected it!  I knew sooner or later--"

"If you're talking about me, Agnes--and what I've been led to believe, we'll save that for
a future time.  I think I'm enough of a man not to harass a person in time of grief."

"Coals of fire, eh?"  A tinge of her old expression had come back, with returning strength.

"Nothing of the kind.  I simply wanted to help you--because you're a woman in trouble.  You're
sick.  Your baby's--gone.  If I can get your husband for you, I--"

But she shook her head, suddenly weak and broken, suddenly only what Barry was trying to make
of her in his mind, a grieving woman, in need.

"We're--not married.  You'll know it sooner or later.  I--I don't know where he is.  He was
here three days ago and was coming back that night.  But he didn't.  Maybe he's gone--he'd
threatened it."

"He?  You mean--"

She pressed her lips tight.

"I'm not going to tell--yet.  You've got to do something for me first. I'm in trouble--" she
was speaking rapidly now, the words flooding over her lips between gasps, her eyes set, her
hands knitting.  "My baby's dead.  You know that, don't you?" she asked suddenly, in apparent
forgetfulness of any previous conversation.  "My baby's dead.  It died yesterday morning--all
day long I held it in my arms and cried.  Then I slept, didn't I?"

"You were unconscious."

"Maybe I'm going to die."  There was childishness in the voice.  "Like my baby.  I baptized
her before she went.  Maybe I'm going to die too."

"I hope not, Agnes."

"You'd like to see me die!"  The frail bonds of an illness-ridden brain were straining at their
leash.  "I can see it in your eyes.  You'd like to see me die!"

"Why?" he could think of nothing else.

"Because--" and then she stopped.  "No--you're trying to get me to tell--but I won't; I'll
tell when you come back--I'll tell what I said and did when you bring me the note from the
priest.  You want me to tell, don't you?  Don't you?  That's what you came here for.  You found
out I was here.  I--did he tell?" she asked sharply.

Barry shook his head.

"I don't know who you mean, Agnes."

"No?  I think you're--"

"I was on my way over the range.  I got lost in the storm and stumbled in here."  He looked
out.  "It's let up some now.  Maybe I could find my way back to town--you must have a doctor."

"I don't want a doctor!  I want to go--with my baby.  And I don't want him to know--understand
that--" with a struggle she raised to one elbow, eyes suddenly blazing with the flashes of
her disordered brain, features strained and excited.  "I don't want him to know!  He ran away
and left me for three days.  The fire went out--my baby--" hysterical laughter broke from her
dry lips--"My baby died, and still he didn't come.  He--"

"Agnes!"  Houston grasped her hands.  "Try to control yourself!  Maybe he couldn't get back.
The storm--"

"Yes, the storm!  It's always the storm!  We would have been married--but there was the storm.
He couldn't marry me months ago--when I found out--and when I came back out here!  He couldn't
marry me then.  'Wait'; that's what he always said--'wait--' and I waited.  Now--" then the
voice trailed off--"it's been three days. That Sheriff, Woods, the incline what guess him say i drew up through Cordillera

"Yes.  Probably on to Crestline.  I was afraid of it."

"Night's coming."

"It's too late to turn back now."

And in spite of the pain of bleeding, snow-burned lips, Houston smiled at her,--the smile that
a man might give a sister of whom he was inordinately proud.

"Are you afraid?"

"Of what?"

"Me."

She did not answer for a moment.  Then:

"Are you afraid--of yourself?"

"No.  Only men with something on their conscience are afraid."

She looked at him queerly, then turned away.  Houston again took the lead, rounding the stretches,
then waiting for her, halting at the dangerous gulleys and guiding her safely across, but silently.
He had said enough; more would require explanations.  And there was a pack upon his back which
contained a tiny form with tight-curled hands, with eyes that were closed,--a poor, nameless
little thing he had sworn to carry to grace and to protection.  At last they reached the cabins.
Houston untied the bond which connected them and loosened his snowshoes, that he might plunge
into the smallest drift before a door and force his way within.  There was no wood; he tore
the clapboards from a near-by cabin and the tar paper from the wind-swept roof.  Five minutes
later a fire was booming; a girl tired, bent-shouldered, her eyes drooping from a sudden desire
for sleep, huddled near it.  Houston walked to the pack and took food.

"You would rather eat alone?"

"Yes."

"I shall be in the next cabin--awake."

"Awake?"

"Yes.  I'd rather--keep watch."

"But there is nothing--"

"Illness--a snowslide--a fresh drift.  I would feel easier in mind. Good night."

Then with his snowshoes and his pack of death, he went out the door, to plunge through another
drift, to force his way into a cabin, and there, a plodding, dumb figure, go soddenly about
the duties of comfort.  And more than once in the howling, blustery night which followed, Houston
shivered, shook himself into action and rose to rebuild a fire that had died while he had sat
hunched in the hard, uncomfortable chair beside it, trying to fathom what the day had meant,
striving to hope for the keeping of the promises that an hysterical woman had made, struggling
for the strength to go on,--on with this cheery, brave little bit of humanity in the next cabin,
without a word in self-extenuation, without a hint to break the lack of estimation in which
she held him, without a plea in his own defense.  And some way, Houston felt that such a plea
now would be cheap and tawdry; they were in a world where there were bigger things than human
aims and human frailties.  Besides, he had locked his lips at the command of a grief-ridden
woman.  To open them in self-extenuation would mean that she must be brought into it; for she
had been the one who had clinched the points of suspicion in the mind of Medaine Robinette.
Were he now to speak of proof that she had lied--

It was impossible.  The wind-swept night became wind-swept dawn, to find him still huddled
there, still thinking, still grim and drawn and haggard with sleeplessness and fatigue.  Then
he rose at a call from without:

"Are you ready?"

He affixed the pack.  Together they went on again, graceless figures in frozen clothing, she
pointing the way, he aiding her with his strength, in the final battle toward the summit of
the range,--and Crestline.

Hours they plodded and climbed, climbed and plodded, the blood again dripping from his lips,
her features again shielded by the heavy folds of the bandanna; the moisture of their breath
at times swirling about them like angry steam, at others invisible in the areas of sudden dryness,
where the atmosphere lapped up even the vapors of laboring lungs before it could visualize.
Snow and cloud and rising walls of granite: this was their world, and they crawling pigmies

Houston dully realized the reason.  The selfish, gripping hands of Winter, holding nothing

Noon.  And a half-cry from both of them, a burst of energy which soon faded.  For above was
Crestline--even as the little Croatian settlement had been--smokeless, lifeless.  They had
gone from here also, hurrying humans fleeing with the last snowplow before the tempest, beings
afraid to remain, once the lines of communication were broken.  But there was nothing to do
but go on.

Roofless houses met them, stacks of crumpled snow, where the beams had cracked beneath the
weight of high piled drifts; staring, glassless windows and rooms filled with white; stoves
that no longer fought the clasp of winter but huddled instead amid piles of snow; that was
all. Crestline had fled; there was no life, no sound, only the angry, wailing cry of the wind
through half-frozen roof spouts, the slap of clattering boards, loosened by the storm.  Gloomily
Houston surveyed the desolate picture, at last to turn to the girl.

 For there would be no ice
here; the drippings of the snowsheds, with their accompanying stalactites and stalagmites,
were absent.  A quick shoot and a lucky one.  Otherwise,--the men who went forward to their
engines would not speak of it.  But there was one who did.

She was standing beside the cook car as Houston passed, and she looked toward him with a glance
that caused Barry to stop and to wait, as though she had called to him.  Hesitatingly she came
forward, and Houston's dulled mentality at last took cognizance that a hand was extended slightly.

"You're still working on the engine?"

"Yes."

"Then you'll be with them?"

"On the Death Trail?  I expect to."

"They talk of it as something terrible.  Why?"

Houston pointed to the forbidding wall of snow.  His thick, broken lips mumbled in the longest
speech he had known in days.

"It's all granite up there.  The cut of the roadbed forms a base for the remainder of the snow.
It's practically all resting on the tracks; above, there's nothing for the snow to cling to.
When we cut out the foundation--they're afraid that the vibration will loosen the rest and
start an avalanche.  It all depends whether it comes before--or after we've passed through."

"And you are not afraid?"  She asked it almost childishly.  He shook his head.

"I--don't know.  I guess every one is--a bit afraid, when they're going into trouble.  I know
what I'm doing, if that's what you mean."

She was silent for a long moment, looking up at the packed drifts, at the ragged outlines of
the mountains against the moonlit sky, then into the valleys and the shimmering form of the
round, icy lake, far below. Her lips moved, and Barry went closer.

"Beg pardon?"

"Nothing--only there are some things I can't understand.  It doesn't seem quite natural--"

"What?"

"That things could--"  Then she straightened and looked at him with clear, frank eyes.  "Mr.
Houston," came quietly, "I've been thinking about something all day.  I have felt that I haven't
been quite fair--that a man who has acted as you have acted since--since I met you this last
time--that he deserves more of a chance than I have given him.  That--"

"I'm asking nothing of you, Miss Robinette."

"I know.  I am asking something of you.  I want to tell you that I have been hoping that you
can some day furnish me the proof--that you spoke of once.  I--that's what I wanted to tell
you," she ended quickly and extended her hand.  "Good-by.  I'll be praying for all of you up
there."

Houston answered only with a pressure of his hand.  His throat had closed suddenly.  His breath
jerked into his lungs; his burning, wind-torn lips ached to touch the hand that had lingered
for a moment in his.  He looked at her with eyes that spoke what his tongue could not say,
then he went on,--a shambling, dead-tired man, even on awaking from sleep, but a man whose
heart was beating with a new fervor.  She would be praying for all of them up there at the
Trail.  And all of them included him.

At the cab of the engine, he listened to the final instructions of the cursing, anxious superintendent,
then went to his black work of the shovel.  Higher and higher mounted the steam on the gauge;
theirs was the first plow, theirs the greatest task.  For if they did not go through, the others
could not follow; if their attack were not swift enough, staunch enough, the slide that was
sure to come sooner or later would carry with it mangled machinery and the torn forms of men
into a chasm of death.  One by one the final orders came,--crisp, shouted, cursing commands,
answered in kind.  Then the last query:

"If there's a damn man of you who's a coward, step out!  Hear that?  If you're afraid--come
on--there's no stopping once you start!"

Engine after engine answered, in jeering, sarcastic tones, the belligerent cries of men hiding
what pounded in their hearts, driving down by sheer will-power the primitive desires of self-preservation.
Again was the call repeated.  Again was it answered by men who snarled, men who cursed that
they might not pray.  And with it:

"A-w-w-w-w--right!  Let 'er go!"

The whistles screamed.  Up the grade, four engines to a plow, the jets of steam shrilling upward,
coughing columns of smoke leaping blackly up the mountain side, the start was made, as the
great, roaring mass of machinery gathered speed for the impact.

A jarring crash that all but threw the men of the first crews from their feet, and the Death
Trail had been met.  Then churning, snarling, roaring, the snow flying in cloud-like masses
past them, the first plow bit its way deep into the tremendous mass, while sweating men, Barry
Houston among them, crammed coal into the open, angry fire boxes, the sand streamed on greasy
tracks,--and the cavalcade went on.

A hundred yards,--the beams knocking down the snow above and all but covering the engines which
forced their way through, only to leave as high a mass behind; while the whole mountain seemed
to tremble; while the peaks above sent back roar for roar, and grim, determined men pulled
harder than ever at the throttles and waited,--for the breath of night again, or the crash
of the avalanche.

Houston, nevertheless, made the changes, glancing up once to assure himself that Medaine still
was there.  She had not left his side.  He went on with the reading:

"'By this time, the mill had gotten to be a sort of mania with me, and I almost had myself
believing that Houston had promised me more than he had given me.  Then, a woman came out here,
an Agnes Jierdon, a stenographer, on her vacation.  I met her and learned that she was from
Boston.'"  A slight pressure exerted itself on Houston's arm.  He glanced down to see Medaine
Robinette's hand, clasped tight.  "'She spent nearly the whole summer here, and I made love
to her.  I asked her to marry me, and she told me that she would. Did a instrument for combining

  The recital went on:

"'Everybody around this country had always talked about how rich he was.  There was a saying
that he didn't believe in banks and that he kept more than a hundred thousand dollars in his
little cabin.  At this time, both he and his son were away at war, and I thought I could steal
this money, place it in other hands, and then work things so that if I did get hold of the
mill, people around here would merely think I had borrowed the money and bought the mill with
it.  By this time, a cousin of Miss Jierdon's, a fellow named Jenkins, had gotten a job with
Houston and was working with her, and of course, I was hearing everything that went on.  It
looked like the deal was going through, and it forced me to action.  One night I watched Mrs.
Renaud and saw her leave the house.  I thought she was going to town. I miscalculated, and Houston, above
lost of giving for pass, who sought business, a posse there would locate him or gather she
wanted into reason.

  I wanted her to switch some papers on
young Mr. Houston for me, and she bucked against it.  Then I told her that she had done worse
things, that she had perjured herself, and that unless she stayed by me, she could be sent
to the penitentiary.  Of course, I didn't tell her in those exact words--I did it more in the
way of making a criminal out of her already, so that the thing she was going to do wouldn't
seem as bad to her.  I wasn't foolish enough to threaten her.  Besides, I told her that the
mill should have been rightfully mine, that the old man had lied to me and gotten me to work
for him for years at starvation wages, on promises that it would be mine some time, and that
he had neither taken me in partnership, nor left it to me in the will.  She got her cousin
to help her in the transfer of the papers; it was a lease and stumpage contract.  He affixed
a notary seal to it.  The thing was illegitimate, of course. Shortly after that, young Houston

She pressed tight her lips, striving bravely for sternness.  But in vain.  An upward curve

"Foolish!" she chided.  "I might have expected you to forget.  It's our first monthiversary!"
