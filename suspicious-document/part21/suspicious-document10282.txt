 

This is the ultimate aristocratic ideal to which we aspire as regards all summer. To do fully offered
many obstacles. The most common is to have no château, or anything remotely similar to it, or the Peninsula
or in the vast expanse of Europe, but this lack is supplied or are obscured if we have a cottage,
a farmhouse or a farm, which, speaking in French château can be described without much scruple.

Still,
however, is too often the family elegant, stylish or fumes, no home
where the smoke come from, ie does not even farm.

If you have a friend or relative, the family can take advantage of friendship or kinship. If
There is not no way farmhouse is deleted the purely rustic resort is limited to the hydropathic,
sweet, salty, or both. That is to mean that not having chateau or farmhouse to spend a month,
used all the time in the bathrooms, though no family never bathe. Just take the waters by
inhalation, breathing, say, Atlantic breezes in that Biarritz in San Juan de Luz, San Sebastian,
Santander or Deva.

Finally, if the desire to be eclipsed in recent months afflict too much heat, and the stock is
so drained, that there is not to go swimming or Motrico sea view,
is gone elegant, stylish family or to any place in La Mancha, where
sometimes the plain and unadorned, and no trees or shrubs of the field,
mimics the sea, and the grasshoppers, crabs and fish and there he
is taking all their fresh flavor, until it is the opportune time and
season return to Madrid without violating the laws and liturgies of
good tone.

There are families, but I just want him to believe, who says, not to violate such laws and liturgies,
as that will make travel and discreet and are surreptitiously economic here in very severe
confinement, having this line of martyrdom, to be conducive to deity whom they worship, which
is the fashion.

Anyway, now really, and using tricks and resources of some sophistical, this is the If in the months
of July, August and September in Madrid is only known person.
 Many times
as they passed under the huge domes formed by the great elms, sycamores, ash dark ink and tiny
leaves, oak, beech and other European trees, could see some Colombian families sheltered
in the bosom of mother fraternldad country as testimonials! I'm talking about huge vines, the parasitic
luxury and lots of trees and shrubs of the New World, which I had greeted in the days of youth,
wandering hunter, between the secular forest of my sweet home. Sometimes it seemed to me that
these beings transplanted scallops Colombia shook their floating, not Spanish breezes blow, but
under the pressure of a secret commotion, by watching a fellow! Perhaps they would say, in mysterious
language of rumors that the man does not understand, "I recognize
....Â» more vigorous Contrast awaited me in the bullring.

A magnificent scene of nature, full of life, majesty, mystery and memories of love, was going to happen
a terrible scene noise, frenetic passion and death .... Instead of the poetry of God and the contemplation
delightful, quirky poetry of heroism wild! It was half past four in the afternoon, and already
the bullring, situated towards the southern end of Aranjuez, was packed with spectators. All
classes had gathered there, but in layers or from floor to floor, according to the financial resources.
The seats, the boxes and lunettes in spite of their discomfort and their gross structure, cost in
general, in the arenas, respectively as in the theaters. It's amazing the interest that the show
wakes up, leading to speculation that the advantageous ticket resellers do. Often their income
is fifty percent and sometimes much higher, when the first sword or Matador is one of the great
art notables, princes of the heroic butchery. Not making a complete description of the bullfight.
 Andaluz, impressionable,
susceptible and graceful hyperbolic discussed without ceremony, Castilian has measured your attic
and common sense in a thousand epigrams and comments burlesque, harsh and raucous Catalan
take things seriously, as if in Parliament or in the bag . Everything discussed in coffee mysteries
Court Chambers and the Government's conduct, press events, causes and phrases noisy scandals,
international events and glorious victories of literary and Torero, speaker and singer. Depth discussion,
perorations eloquent and gallant, chronic things scandalous, frivolous and big business and light
illusions, and even ardent love and terrible passions are aroused at the altar full of life,
essentially democratic. Those who have studied a small cafe in Madrid and Barcelona, ââSeville
and Cadiz, knows one of the most marked phases of Spanish society. For the rest, coffee is not for
the Spanish, but an element of association, because apart from being
very sober have no taste or drink coffee know.

What
is the milk is very, very slightly sweetened with brown paint, and have
a fancy to drink a cup to warm. They are not power, but in terms chocolate
and wine.

I am averse to bitter coffee, because he delights in rancid oil. Everyone has their tastes
and that there is no dispute.
 This, more generous than
men, withdraws and finds another enemy; rarely preys on a victim. Also, all the bullfighters
comes to save the falling picador, and he is lifted and dropped like a statue, because his legs
are splinted and they cannot move.
