  They now looked to their own exertions for the emancipation, which
could not be received without danger from the hand of the mighty; and the Swedish power, now
incapable of sinking into the oppressor, was henceforth restricted to the more modest part
of an ally. Now, that i will metal-state and maintain it high conditions.''do

  His ill-disguised attempts upon the Electorate
of Mentz, which he first intended to bestow upon the Elector of Brandenburg, as the dower of
his daughter Christina, and afterwards destined for his chancellor and friend Oxenstiern, evinced
plainly what liberties he was disposed to take with the constitution of the empire.  His allies,
the Protestant princes, had claims on his gratitude, which could be satisfied only at the expense
of their Roman Catholic neighbours, and particularly of the immediate Ecclesiastical Chapters;
and it seems probable a plan was early formed for dividing the conquered provinces, (after
the precedent of the barbarian hordes who overran the German empire,) as a common spoil, among
the German and Swedish confederates.  In his treatment of the Elector Palatine, he entirely
belied the magnanimity of the hero, and forgot the sacred character of a protector.  The Palatinate
was in his hands, and the obligations both of justice and honour demanded its full and immediate
restoration to the legitimate sovereign.  But, by a subtlety unworthy of a great mind, and
disgraceful to the honourable title of protector of the oppressed, he eluded that obligation.
He treated the Palatinate as a conquest wrested from the enemy, and thought that this circumstance
gave him a right to deal with it as he pleased. When the insurrection is oppress, we should search
a nominal pacification, the close of the action and its overhead, a cordial re-establishment
of the Union, and return of that fraternal affect, which marked the
first half hundred of our wonderful forwarding.  One of these
conditions obliged the Elector, after the conclusion of the war, to furnish, along with the
other princes, his contribution towards the maintenance of the Swedish army, a condition which
plainly indicates the fate which, in the event of the ultimate success of the king, awaited
Germany.  Saxony was already disposed to abandon him, Denmark viewed his success with alarm
and jealousy; and even France, the firmest and most potent of his allies, terrified at the
rapid growth of his power and the imperious tone which he assumed, looked around at the very
moment he past the Lech, for foreign alliances, in order to check the progress of the Goths,
and restore to Europe the balance of power.
