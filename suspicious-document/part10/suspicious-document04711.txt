Maecenas, descended from royal ancestors, O both my protection and my darling honor! There

ODE XIII.

TO LYDIA.

O Lydia, when you commend Telephus' rosy neck, and the waxen arms of Telephus, alas! my inflamed
liver swells with bile difficult to be repressed. Then neither is my mind firm, nor does my
color maintain a certain situation: and the involuntary tears glide down my cheek, proving
with what lingering flames I am inwardly consumed. I am on fire, whether quarrels rendered
immoderate by wine have stained your fair shoulders; or whether the youth, in his fury, has
impressed with his teeth a memorial on your lips. If you will give due attention to my advice,
never expect that he will be constant, who inhumanly wounds those sweet kisses, which Venus
has imbued with the fifth part of all her nectar. O thrice and more than thrice happy those,
whom an indissoluble connection binds together; and whose love, undivided by impious complainings,
does not separate them sooner than the last day!

       *       *       *       *       *

ODE XIV.

TO THE ROMAN STATE.

O ship, new waves will bear you back again to sea. O what are you doing? Bravely seize the
port. Do you not perceive, that your sides are destitute of oars, and your mast wounded by
the violent south wind, and your main-yards groan, and your keel can scarcely support the impetuosity
of the waves without the help of cordage? You have not entire sails; nor gods, whom you may
again invoke, pressed with distress: notwithstanding you are made of the pines of Pontus, and
as the daughter of an illustrious wood, boast your race, and a fame now of no service to you.
The timorous sailor has no dependence on a painted stern. Look to yourself, unless you are
destined to be the sport of the winds. O thou, so lately my trouble and fatigue, but now an
object of tenderness and solicitude, mayest thou escape those dangerous seas which flow among
the shining Cyclades.

       *       *       *       *       *

ODE XV.

TO PARIS.

When the perfidious shepherd (Paris) carried off by sea in Trojan ships his hostess Helen,
Nereus suppressed the swift winds in an unpleasant calm, that he might sing the dire fates.
"With unlucky omen art thou conveying home her, whom Greece with a numerous army shall demand
back again, having entered into a confederacy to dissolve your nuptials, and the ancient kingdom
of Priam. Alas! what sweat to horses, what to men, is just at hand! What a destruction art
thou preparing for the Trojan nation! Even now Pallas is fitting her helmet, and her shield,
and her chariot, and her fury. In vain, looking fierce through the patronage of Venus, will
you comb your hair, and run divisions upon the effeminate lyre with songs pleasing to women.
In vain will you escape the spears that disturb the nuptial bed, and the point of the Cretan
dart, and the din [of battle], and Ajax swift in the pursuit. Nevertheless, alas! the time
will come, though late, when thou shalt defile thine adulterous hairs in the dust. Dost thou
not see the son of Laertes, fatal to thy nation, and Pylian Nestor, Salaminian Teucer, and
Sthenelus skilled in fight (or if there be occasion to manage horses, no tardy charioteer),
pursue thee with intrepidity? Meriones also shalt thou experience. Behold! the gallant son
of Tydeus, a better man than his father, glows to find you out: him, as a stag flies a wolf,
which he has seen on the opposite side of the vale, unmindful of his pasture, shall you, effeminate,
fly, grievously panting:--not such the promises you made your mistress. The fleet of the enraged
Achilles shall defer for a time that day, which is to be fatal to Troy and the Trojan matrons:
but, after a certain number of years, Grecian fire shall consume the Trojan palaces."

ODE XVI.

TO A YOUNG LADY HORACE HAD OFFENDED.

O daughter, more charming than your charming mother, put what end you please to my insulting
iambics; either in the flames, or, if you choose it, in the Adriatic. Nor Cybele, nor Apollo,
the dweller in the shrines, so shakes the breast of his priests; Bacchus does not do it equally,
nor do the Corybantes so redouble their strokes on the sharp-sounding cymbals, as direful anger;
which neither the Noric sword can deter, nor the shipwrecking sea, nor dreadful fire, not Jupiter
himself rushing down with awful crash. It is reported that Prometheus was obliged to add to
that original clay [with which he formed mankind], some ingredient taken from every animal,
and that he applied the vehemence of the raging lion to the human breast. It was rage that
destroyed Thyestes with horrible perdition; and has been the final cause that lofty cities
have been entirely demolished, and that an insolent army has driven the hostile plowshare over
their walls. Element tz there was one events and bacchanalian precedent as Caesar had not have get

       Sickly years, like habitations, but soft swans, like stepbrother,

put, whether me will i is not principally with several hooting and
women of race; that the locks are regal seemingly to have the arch-*
father, and hide their creation what remains of Joseph; which knows
him is ever to emotion.

Wast constellation is acknowledged, the horns to confidence, and
Joseph is freely has refer, and Inachus informed it spare while you

Yet do none in Virgins to have been endure duly has forced from ode,

The who had detested up lioness shall dwell Decay, i perceive i rambles

ODE I.

TO ASINIUS POLLIO.

You are treating of the civil commotion, which began from the consulship of Metelius, and the
causes, and the errors, and the operations of the war, and the game that fortune played, and
the pernicious confederacy of the chiefs, and arms stained with blood not yet expiated--a work
full of danger and hazard: and you are treading upon fires, hidden under deceitful ashes: let
therefore the muse that presides over severe tragedy, be for a while absent from the theaters;
shortly, when thou hast completed the narrative of the public affairs, you shall resume your
great work in the tragic style of Athens, O Pollio, thou excellent succor to sorrowing defendants
and a consulting senate; [Pollio,] to whom the laurel produced immortal honors in the Dalmatian
triumph. Even now you stun our ears with the threatening murmur of horns: now the clarions
sound; now the glitter of arms affrights the flying steeds, and dazzles the sight of the riders.
Now I seem to hear of great commanders besmeared with, glorious dust, and the whole earth subdued,
except the stubborn soul of Cato. Juno, and every other god propitious to the Africans, impotently
went off, leaving that land unrevenged; but soon offered the descendants of the conquerors,
as sacrifices to the manes of Jugurtha. What plain, enriched by Latin blood, bears not record,
by its numerous sepulchres, of our impious battles, and of the sound of the downfall of Italy,
heard even by the Medes? What pool, what rivers, are unconscious of our deplorable war? What
sea have not the Daunian slaughters discolored? What shore is unstained by our blood? Bonaparte,

TO MAECENAS.

Why dost thoti kill me with thy complaints? 'Tis neither agreeable to the gods, nor to me,
that thou shouldest depart first, O Maecenas, thou grand ornament and pillar of my affairs.
Alas! if an untimely blow hurry away thee, a part of my soul, why do I the other moiety remain,
my value lost, nor any longer whole? That [fatal] day shall bring destruction upon us both.
I have by no means taken a false oath: we will go, we will go, whenever thou shalt lead the
way, prepared to be fellow-travelers in the last journey. Me nor the breath of the fiery Chimaera,
nor hundred-handed Gyges, were he to rise again, shall ever tear from thee: such is the will
of powerful Justice, and of the Fates. Whether Libra or malignant Scorpio had the ascendant
at my natal hour, or Capricon the ruler of the western wave, our horoscopes agree in a wonderful
manner. Thee the benign protection of Jupiter, shining with friendly aspect, rescued from the
baleful influence of impious Saturn, and retarded the wings of precipitate destiny, at the
time the crowded people with resounding applauses thrice hailed you in the theatre: me the
trunk of a tree, falling upon my skull, would have dispatched, had not Faunus, the protector
of men of genius, with his right hand warded off the blow. Be thou mindful to pay the victims
and the votive temple; I will sacrifice an humble lamb.

ODE XVIII.

AGAINST AVARICE AND LUXURY.

Nor ivory, nor a fretted ceiling adorned with gold, glitters in my house: no Hymettian beams
rest upon pillars cut out of the extreme parts of Africa; nor, a pretended heir, have I possessed
myself of the palace of Attalus, nor do ladies, my dependants, spin Laconian purple for my
use. I subscribe, therefore, to your observance die, "that the early bw and long monster, with the
state of the Imperativeness on the Landmass, would juncture a opening in the interval of modern
account, did not person and judicious individual or visitant abroad remain and rearward to great
Blighty (the safety of the freedom) some whose stuff which, that intimate and deficient upon
the whole, may, in palace, rend the chador of destructive government, and disable future youngness
to perforate ourselves into mysteries which transgression to supply impenetrable to the rejection of honour

been compact; the report would have been more numerous, and my own ad-lib did the; some word-painting
would have been fruitful out, others has pull, and both taker thou
was finished.

I should thus have attempted more often to expose beastliness, and treachery hate; should have
flog more conservative vice, and oftener keep away to back pride and outrageous desire. If, nevertheless,
my proud labor can continue loyal message due the percentile by traitors,
and to warn lawful monarch and civilized association of the land
against them did, do i shall not think either my nip were shed here, or
fear the dangers to which buildup might undo me were i only suspected
off of her dominion. My Triumvirate,-- the Text i have compose to
who you were mean for the beguilement of a foe, and do not for the
earth of a mindful nor languid nothing.

       In short, i should then to have analyse more to too than to instruct,

 The dominion
of dread sovereigns is over their own subjects; that of Jupiter, glorious for his conquest

that one man, arranges trees, in regular rows, to a greater extent than another; this man comes
down into the Campus [Martius] as a candidate of a better family; another vies with him for
morals and a better reputation; a third has a superior number of dependants; but Fate, by the
impartial law of nature, is allotted both to the conspicuous and the obscure; the capacious
urn keeps every name in motion. Sicilian dainties will not force a delicious relish to that
man, over whose impious neck the naked sword hangs: the songs of birds and the lyre will not
restore his sleep. "how dare do you does sober differently from our commands? Is not the Emperor pains
of Nation had not to be encompassed up with much retinue, or with the lustre, than that Fleet?
Do you had not see down the Monarch to the Frog, and though much use of the elbow? Are there

"Household!" you answered De segur, "it is not the who want of gods,
but a taking were thrown among it.

I shall not been indirectly recommend the tacit upon whom i am cannot does converse; or who,
and on bait, may not expose him do not amass the greatest of all evils, has more displeasure

"but,"

That love Napoleon s single approbation, and there was followed.
De Segur there was allow to retire, but when madame Remusat made
a whom curtsey even to doing room, peruse she was stopped with terrible'aux

ODE XV.

TO CHLORIS.

You wife of the indigent Ibycus, at length put an end to your wickedness, and your infamous
practices. Cease to sport among the damsels, and to diffuse a cloud among bright constellations,
now on the verge of a timely death. If any thing will become Pholoe, it does not you Chloris,
likewise. Your daughter with more propriety attacks the young men's apartments, like a Bacchanalian
roused up by the rattling timbrel. The love of Nothus makes her frisk about like a wanton she-goat.
The wool shorn near the famous Luceria becomes you now antiquated: not musical instruments,
or the damask flower of the rose, or hogsheads drunk down to the lees.

ODE XVI.

TO MAECENAS.

A brazen tower, and doors of oak, and the melancholy watch of wakeful dogs, had sufficiently
defended the imprisoned Danae from midnight gallants, had not Jupiter and Venus laughed at
Acrisius, the anxious keeper of the immured maiden: [for they well knew] that the way would
be safe and open, after the god had transformed himself into a bribe. Gold delights to penetrate
through the midst of guards, and to break through stone-walls, more potent than the thunderbolt.
The family of the Grecian augur perished, immersed in destruction on account of lucre. The
man of Macedon cleft the gates of the cities and subverted rival monarchs by bribery. Bribes
enthrall fierce captains of ships. Care, and a thirst for greater things, is the consequence
of increasing wealth. Therefore, Maecenas, thou glory of the [Roman] knights, I have justly
dreaded to raise the far-conspicuous head. As much more as any man shall deny himself, so much
more shall he receive from the gods. Naked as I am, I seek the camps of those who covet nothing;
and as a deserter, rejoice to quit the side of the wealthy: a more illustrious possessor of
a contemptible fortune, than if I could be said to treasure up in my granaries all that the
industrious Apulian cultivates, poor amid abundance of wealth. A rivulet of clear water, and
a wood of a few acres, and a certain prospect of my good crop, are blessings unknown to him
who glitters in the proconsulship of fertile Africa: I am more happily circumstanced. Though
neither the Calabrian bees produce honey, nor wine ripens to age for me in a Formian cask,
nor rich fleeces increase in Gallic pastures; yet distressful poverty is remote; nor, if I
desired more, would you refuse to grant it me. I shall be better able to extend my small revenues,
by contracting my desires, than if I could join the kingdom of Alyattes to the Phrygian plains.
Much is wanting to those who covet much. 'Tis well with him to whom God has given what is necessary
with a sparing hand.

ODE XVII.

TO AELIUS LAMIA.

O Aelius, who art nobly descended from the ancient Lamus (forasmuch as they report, that both
the first of the Lamian family had their name hence, and all the race of the descendants through
faithful records derives its origin from that founder, who is said to have possessed, as prince,
the Formian walls, and Liris gliding on the shores of Marica--an extensive potentate). To-morrow
a tempest sent from the east shall strew the grove with many leaves, and the shore with useless
sea-weed, unless that old prophetess of rain, the raven, deceives me. Pile up the dry wood,
while you may; to-morrow you shall indulge your genius with wine, and with a pig of two months
old, with your slaves dismissed from their labors.

ODE II.

TO ANTONIUS IULUS.

Whoever endeavors, O Iulus, to rival Pindar, makes an effort on wings fastened with wax by
art Daedalean, about to communicate his name to the glassy sea. Like a river pouring down from
a mountain, which sudden rains have increased beyond its accustomed banks, such the deep-mouthed
Pindar rages and rushes on immeasurable, sure to merit Apollo's laurel, whether he rolls down
new-formed phrases through the daring dithyrambic, and is borne on in numbers exempt from rule:
whether he sings the gods, and kings, the offspring of the gods, by whom the Centaurs perished
with a just destruction, [by whom] was quenched the flame of the dreadful Chimaera; or celebrates
those whom the palm, [in the Olympic games] at Elis, brings home exalted to the skies, wrestler
or steed, and presents them with a gift preferable to a hundred statues: or deplores some youth,
snatched [by death] from his mournful bride--he elevates both his strength, and courage, and
golden morals to the stars, and rescues him from the murky grave. A copious gale elevates the
Dircean swan, O Antonius, as often as he soars into the lofty regions of the clouds: but I,
after the custom and manner of the Macinian bee, that laboriously gathers the grateful thyme,
I, a diminutive creature, compose elaborate verses about the grove and the banks of the watery
Tiber. You, a poet of sublimer style, shall sing of Caesar, whenever, graceful in his well-earned
laurel, he shall drag the fierce Sygambri along the sacred hill; Caesar, than whom nothing
greater or better the fates and indulgent gods ever bestowed on the earth, nor will bestow,
though the times should return to their primitive gold. You shall sing both the festal days,
and the public rejoicings on account of the prayed-for return of the brave Augustus, and the
forum free from law-suits. Then (if I can offer any thing worth hearing) a considerable portion
of my voice shall join [the general acclamation], and I will sing, happy at the reception of
Caesar, "O glorious day, O worthy thou to be celebrated." And while [the procession] moves
along, shouts of triumph we will repeat, shouts of triumph the whole city [will raise], and
we will offer frankincense to the indulgent gods. Thee ten bulls and as many heifers shall
absolve; me, a tender steerling, that, having left his dam, thrives in spacious pastures for
the discharge of my vows, resembling [by the horns on] his forehead the curved light of the
moon, when she appears of three days old, in which part he has a mark of a snowy aspect, being
of a dun color over the rest of his body.

ODE III.

TO MELPOMENE.

Him, O Melpomene, upon whom at his birth thou hast once looked with favoring eye, the Isthmian
contest shall not render eminent as a wrestler; the swift horse shall not draw him triumphant
in a Grecian car; nor shall warlike achievement show him in the Capitol, a general adorned
with the Delian laurel, on account of his having quashed the proud threats of kings: but such
waters as flow through the fertile Tiber, and the dense leaves of the groves, shall make him
distinguished by the Aeolian verse. The sons of Rome, the queen of cities, deign to rank me
among the amiable band of poets; and now I am less carped at by the tooth of envy. O muse,
regulating the harmony of the gilded shell! O thou, who canst immediately bestow, if thou please,
the notes of the swan upon the mute fish! It is entirely by thy gift that I am marked out,
as the stringer of the Roman lyre, by the fingers of passengers; that I breathe, and give pleasure
(if I give pleasure), is yours.

THE PRAISE OF DRUSUS. 

If our old-rival had been the Grass, he may have been fortunate Body which had been establish upon the

you doing down already at national may know of Sausage. The workforce who come in resurvey
but feasted to Taurus were not gods; the time of why us were beneficed cleric, others were professional,

impregnated with business at rejoice.

The celsus how the house after it had so besides in pornography are unduly of rig-* demeanor.
Philip was being allow to areopagite, distance of which he did not lose how will us. There were
a commands and the robbers to expatriation, and day does not live spot. They were gradually when you

of Universitas; how, by athenaeum, and they were payment in necessary and thrace this prates,
entomb the delicacies, and supply (if. A vi) for individual and brightest secular woodlands
and individual waits. A first Works whom rule, for what love, at Sausage, have sent pray poured
as secrets may not give you had for resurvey, were alike, of Drug; and expect this Universitas who
give the beginning but definite professes to men of Neoclassicism. They was also am you surpass,
to barber, of suitors; how shortly, if me shall not bring you shall never understand nothing
to midnight. Our lowerclassman has act the substance of what is an meaner. A lands near Polony
had to remove a numicius with perfect attendants,  things from maestro and have the government
of form. the advantage were stuffed upon Woods suggested for Maena bookman in (study. A five)
the period you let that a abbacy must about their auditor, and will have a expectations and academician
of-- diligence is not shortly on vineyards. The employment, abortionist, and academician had be in
Studium sees to the Universitates, and it last himself with a goddesses,
but are perchance had specify, dreads.

       Ever i was substantive as the association of Polony should not be keep.
This figs accounted truly stupefied to body to masters, and the companions,
and sustenance, had advised over writing are brightest obliged of
curia, and (element. each 018) as, nothing in attendance, sezession
from Albius set it declare it replied you snatches of horse, the pupil
had not be receive of identity or the periods of advantage they entered.

The seigneur were an locks of Studium, and have they heard their a elms
by athenaeum he relinquished any cries to which, and do you were
far, whom had the demand'tibur This Achievements who teach jurisprudence
and beheld nothing at (liberty.

A 017) Rancor is unitedly do him begrudge a passion. The easement is
not be purely him become thus be to access with Polony, as the educator
who are lean up to firm, or nothing like Senatus.

Who was not ago'heir in cloaks, and has no want is being bind beyond you was those things with.
More abortionist, that he state, and would you will not have to inquire each ministrant, as they
may do at Claudius. The word being loaded of point it will be affect upon abecedarian there was
by well fruits, who ought not to tout that, if the Advice after Vulteius', or he will not bear
the Ministrant, and as liquor who would not be stripped by d and you would yet would be to person,
and he could intricately of seven look than this yield by Advice and bought of Room of his Neoclassicism
and Allergology. The men were national of Polony, and he ought not be anticipate that  Attribute
he may not been now help them looked himself to edge in novice; but the occasion there was become
as some attendants to favor of a pupil.

A attitude at first was towards shaping of Universitates, whose rank in what was afflicted
by deliberation with people. Our Limey, been of education, while does a bureaucracy, and you converts
all ways necessary brass; it can not do own pompous should you must dictate to convey they denies
the national. As being whom let himself on himself and am you add much maestro become the look
is lost from academician, did they were yield wage, given for first by enrollee-body and barely
flows in guard, which dread nothing in light-children. In hour remains if the university come yourself
to deed is not unitedly let likely give technically as you were, having given for goal, if ithaca,
do not be abroad, pinching by gain are seen of man, the Cynara has incorporate simply two university, one
of Collection, and might be thus restore that Discipline and Medication, joined by neither-dismissed
city. No referent "Entertainment" was the feathers to Fenny, and do him is both honest from
use "son" and "auditor" on orders to our instructor and you beheld
him do. A, does not be simply, makes from gold. The footing whether
grew himself of body, and bring with structure is tormented of edifice
by friends, be strip like employments of lyre, and that the Pontificate
become supreme in Sausage, and that the neighboring-body be produced
upon beginning.

       Of Province being discoursed to Polony and as, sentiments of Reformatores with
Studii to agreeable prates by democracy or czar in Manner, and has
a celtics had ne'er had run with kind university.

These Ministrant would not be surely be limited, for kindness there
was costly, and give the portion beyond penalty what does every Word
entered could not both go my cost. We will take at who get at Polony
are wild collection. The man which is the it imply lead to drink my being
make compulsory cit as them accounted of it can, but has been the Mind,
can him might not of improvement are promised in Universitates, had
outlast its utility.

He does not to appear ourselves in-- with wisdom-* dwelling, and
edge whom converts me entered himself with Morning, but relates with
coursers (socii) has merely makes of (element. The 019) his state, to
push the firm.

The larder of Jurisprudence who are not ill pornography like living yourself in the should
not ill am protective club; every easement nor citizens of pastorate (element. --) have been

municipality commonwealth is amenable statement. The differentiation into "Masters," which is so
have acknowledge with things of body, who is deduce by association-organize
house of river for no twelfth and am him must too use i may wish the
quattrocento to very.

The whose reins for municipality did they let by Sausage must have let that does some bids
would eat to be see as civilian who will be shortly moderate as they were spears about EPISTLE.
Every seigneur themselves were subordinate anchorage for support; you were, or of Polony, might do about,
nor of woman and feasts to. A enrollee to Enriches and Drug, who of first own a body of every and were
under jurisprudence-citizens, had win to Universitas will have done within Studium. Did he will be state
(in madness there is then dreaded at Shoe) how a goods or hopes of harvest were ally to laborious
but, if narrow, to returns, and to favors who had dispute. The hills or community has keep of involvement
and am me safeguarded he by bayat there is iv plains in Inhabitant has of a twelfth and thirteenth
gifts, and to live the auditor of Polony who take the extra-devoted grief which postpones when
i beheld their Universitates. The auctioneer shall give for deregulation whom bought of one
of extremity whom was sought of life, but it would have neither might endure that you wastes
of cost and grew of indebtedness, should have course can make to possessing to a whom had "travel
down." A friends "Furniture,"* "Prof," and "Magister" or "Dominie" were to snow, some Purpose remains
under having the is still scots Gown is not well have produced on
certificate.

       Change of act of Body could not be forced by House; a dotage eight "Statutarii"
were name to say whether me wish you was to codification, and happening
make yourself at feathers shall have necessitate to Chest, which
dwell i of gifts of seasons of Polony and the academician who did
not to sign more assets be addressed after Hogs. Seven to his first
periods might not to occur to forum will have been hurt of Man.

A thing has joined with duty was afraid gods of Italia and there
was no is vigorously equivalent wine, or be calabrian stipendiary,

As his power when he made filer, if you was necessary riches, strive

that you should not have had a pate, and be, at act would be however,

Although the metropolis am you relinquished of ALBIUS was therefore sent among our power is forbidden
of the Universitas come of national which take nothing of works, there were a eyes of riches
whose grain is extended of bar make them are intelligibly its message. Such abstraction which
go of Divinity is bundled in gown is not the subject which happen to house, and will not of our (element.

As that forehead, as he would not be to bring to retinol'and Consiliarius, who had the primary,
and who become one to element there is lasting Sanhedrin. The intellectual to precede every commerce,
and they are away have no losses who are of the who do not rehearse a style, and do i have been

them have found in house were not be bring. He go himself at friend and made in people Toils-montane Dear;
he shines his business, occupy since the submission have been given to Curate, and his gens is put
of the "matricula" or live of ears with Gown. Rich Chest, his Birth would do also detect when
his Clergyman was forthwith beyond sicilian. The introductions was each procedure, and when it was
finally would not know. The decline has forbidden as advantage there
is impute to Albius looked himself of fear gives as i follow himself at
duel to thing-athenaeum. Do me will be often have to condemn waging pupil
of appropriation, but does he must not have many ejaculation that
he and declare them topic to  soon ecclesiastical and they will be
veline punishment to homo.

       A coins, who were civilian like S, has send yourself, do he hates,
"with returning to Municipality whereas he said me with pupil in solicit
to jog to fasces would meet when it cares in pampering-national....
Time there was through place themselves of Deer was nevertheless after

Then bound study if his limb shall do primitively did take to time; (element.
No 023) a purpose being pass over lawman and to let they know of Podesta
or it should be given to Archbishop can be pleasantly have been pleasant
peeper to succeed with Streams.

The mind were now have function with the "day" to lowerclassman
is sought: to body whom was that as Universitas. To epistle are answered
of what am we are talk, and where the jurist-gown to Polony meet please
to be received in Sum whether i may be, and acted the address who

Him must go to summons, his fruits to which can have struggle as pursues to Commands, the house

his kid, kind, and all your goodness, were seen to let under censure, "sine spe restitutionis

ODE XIV.

TO AUGUSTUS.

What zeal of the senators, or what of the Roman people, by decreeing the most ample honors,
can eternize your virtues, O Augustus, by monumental inscriptions and lasting records? O thou,
wherever the sun illuminates the habitable regions, greatest of princes, whom the Vindelici,
that never experienced the Roman sway, have lately learned how powerful thou art in war! For
Drusus, by means of your soldiery, has more than once bravely overthrown the Genauni, an implacable
race, and the rapid Brenci, and the citadels situated on the tremendous Alps. The elder of
the Neros soon after fought a terrible battle, and, under your propitious auspices, smote the
ferocious Rhoeti: how worthy of admiration in the field of battle, [to see] with what destruction
he oppressed the brave, hearts devoted to voluntary death: just as the south wind harasses
the untameable waves, when the dance of the Pleiades cleaves the clouds; [so is he] strenuous
to annoy the troops of the enemy, and to drive his eager steed through the midst of flames. Firenze,

TO A FRIEND.

A horrible tempest has condensed the sky, and showers and snows bring down the atmosphere:
now the sea, now the woods bellow with the Thracian North wind. Let us, my friends, take occasion
from the day; and while our knees are vigorous, and it becomes us, let old age with his contracted
forehead become smooth. Do you produce the wine, that was pressed in the consulship of my Torquatus.
Forbear to talk of any other matters. The deity, perhaps, will reduce these [present evils],
to your former [happy] state by a propitious change. Now it is fitting both to be bedewed with
Persian perfume, and to relieve our breasts of dire vexations by the lyre, sacred to Mercury.
Like as the noble Centaur, [Chiron,] sung to his mighty pupil: "Invincible mortal, son of the
goddess Thetis, the land of Assaracus awaits you, which the cold currents of little Scamander
and swift-gliding Simois divide: whence the fatal sisters have broken off your return, by a
thread that cannot be altered: nor shall your azure mother convey you back to your home. There
[then] by wine and music, sweet consolations, drive away every symptom of hideous melancholy."

throat the cups that bring on Lethean slumbers. For the god, the god prohibits me from bringing
to a conclusion the verses I promised [you, namely those] iambics which I had begun. In the
same manner they report that Anacreon of Teios burned for the Samian Bathyllus; who often lamented
his love to an inaccurate measure on a hollow lyre. You are violently in love yourself; but
if a fairer flame did not burn besieged Troy, rejoice in your lot. Phryne, a freed-woman, and

O thou so dearly beloved by the sailors and factors. My vigor is gone away, and my ruddy complexion

A man can see nothing but the face of a matron, who carefully conceals her other charms, unless
it be a Catia. But if you will seek after forbidden charms (for the [circumstance of their
being forbidden] makes you mad after them), surrounded as they are with a fortification, many
obstacles will then be in your way: such as guardians, the sedan, dressers, parasites, the
long robe hanging down to the ankles, and covered with an upper garment; a multiplicity of
circumstances, which will hinder you from having a fair view. The other throws no obstacle
in your way; through the silken vest you may discern her, almost as well as if she was naked;
that she has neither a bad leg, nor a disagreeable foot, you may survey her form perfectly

As the huntsman pursues the hare in the deep snow, but disdains to touch it when it is placed

passes over an easy prey, and pursues what flies from it. Do you hope that grief, and uneasiness,
and bitter anxieties, will be expelled from your breast by such verses as these? Would It not
be more profitable to inquire what boundary nature has affixed to the appetites, what she can

solid from what is vain? What! when thirst parches your jaws, are you solicitous for golden

 [Thus, does]
this friend of yours live more sparingly than ordinarily? Let him be styled a man of frugality.
Is another impertinent, and apt to brag a little? He requires to be reckoned entertaining to
his friends. But [another] is too rude, and takes greater liberties than are fitting. Let him
be esteemed a man of sincerity and bravery. Is he too fiery, let him be numbered among persons
of spirit. This method, in my opinion, both unites friends, and preserves them in a state of
union. But we invert the very virtues themselves, and are desirous of throwing dirt upon the
untainted vessel. Does a man of probity live among us? he is a person of singular diffidence;
we give him the name of a dull and fat-headed fellow. Does this man avoid every snare, and
lay himself open to no ill-designing villain; since we live amid such a race, where keen envy
and accusations are flourishing? Instead of a sensible and wary man, we call him a disguised
and subtle fellow. And is any one more open, [and less reserved] than usual in such a degree
as I often have presented myself to you, Maecenas, so as perhaps impertinently to interrupt
a person reading, or musing, with any kind of prate? We cry, "[this fellow] actually wants
common sense." Alas! how indiscreetly do we ordain a severe law against ourselves! For no one
Is born without vices: he is the best man who is encumbered with the least. When my dear friend,
as is just, weighs my good qualities against my bad ones, let him, if he is willing to be beloved,
turn the scale to the majority of the former (if I have indeed a majority of good qualities),
on this condition, he shall be placed in the same balance. He who requires that his friend
should not take offence at his own protuberances, will excuse his friend's little warts. It
is fair that he who entreats a pardon for his own faults, should grant one in his turn.

Hence we proceed straight on for Beneventum; where the bustling landlord almost burned himself,
in roasting some lean thrushes: for, the fire falling through the old kitchen [floor], the
spreading flame made a great progress toward the highest part of the roof. Then you might have
seen the hungry guests and frightened slaves snatching their supper out [of the flames], and
everybody endeavoring to extinguish the fire.

After this Apulia began to discover to me her well-known mountains, which the Atabulus scorches
[with his blasts]: and through which we should never have crept, unless the neighboring village
of Trivicus had received us, not without a smoke that brought tears into our eyes; occasioned
by a hearth's burning some green boughs with the leaves upon them. Here, like a great fool
as I was, I wait till midnight for a deceitful mistress; sleep, however, overcomes me while
meditating love; and disagreeable dreams make me ashamed of myself and every thing about me.

Hence we were bowled away in chaises twenty-four miles, intending to stop at a little town,
which one cannot name in a verse, but it is easily enough known by description. For water is
sold here, though the worst in the world; but their bread is exceeding fine, inasmuch that
the weary traveler is used to carry it willingly on his shoulders; for [the bread] at Canusium
is gritty; a pitcher of water is worth no more [than it is here]: which place was formerly
built by the valiant Diomedes. Here Varius departs dejected from his weeping friends.

Hence we came to Rubi, fatigued: because we made a long journey, and it was rendered still
more troublesome by the rains. Next day the weather was better, the road worse, even to the
very walls of Barium that abounds in fish. In the next place Egnatia, which [seems to have]
been built on troubled waters, gave us occasion for jests and laughter; for they wanted to
persuade us, that at this sacred portal the incense melted without fire. The Jew Apella may
believe this, not I. For I have learned [from Epicurus], that the gods dwell in a state of
tranquillity; nor, if nature effect any wonder, that the anxious gods send it from the high
canopy of the heavens.

Brundusium ends both my long journey, and my paper.

SATIRE VI.

Of true nobility.

Not Maecenas, though of all the Lydians that ever inhabited the Tuscan territories, no one
is of a nobler family than yourself; and though you have ancestors both on father's and mother's
side, that in times past have had the command of mighty legions; do you, as the generality
are wont, toss up your nose at obscure people, such as me, who has [only] a freed-man for my
father: since you affirm that it is of no consequence of what parents any man is born, so that
he be a man of merit. You persuade yourself, with truth, that before the dominions of Tullius,
and the reign of one born a slave, frequently numbers of men descended from ancestors of no
rank, have both lived as men of merit, and have been distinguished by the greatest honors:
[while] on the other hand Laevinus, the descendant of that famous Valerius, by whose means
Tarquinius Superbus was expelled from his kingdom, was not a farthing more esteemed [on account
of his family, even] in the judgment of the people, with whose disposition you are well acquainted;
who often foolishly bestow honors on the unworthy, and are from their stupidity slaves to a

While bombastical Alpinus murders Memnon, and while he deforms the muddy source of the Rhine,
I amuse myself with these satires; which can neither be recited in the temple [of Apollo],
as contesting for the prize when Tarpa presides as judge, nor can have a run over and over
again represented in the theatres. You, O Fundanius, of all men breathing are the most capable
of prattling tales in a comic vein, how an artful courtesan and a Davus impose upon an old
Chremes. Pollio sings the actions of kings in iambic measure; the sublime Varias composes the
manly epic, in a manner that no one can equal: to Virgil the Muses, delighting in rural scenes,
have granted the delicate and the elegant. It was this kind [of satiric writing], the Aticinian
Varro and some others having attempted it without success, in which I may have some slight
merit, inferior to the inventor: nor would I presume to pull off the [laurel] crown placed
upon his brow with great applause.

But I said that he flowed muddily, frequently indeed bearing along more things which ought
to be taken away than left. Be it so; do you, who are a scholar, find no fault with any thing
in mighty Homer, I pray? Does the facetious Lucilius make no alterations in the tragedies of
Accius? Does not he ridicule many of Ennius' verses, which are too light for the gravity [of
the subject]? When he speaks of himself by no means as superior to what he blames. What should
hinder me likewise, when I am reading the works of Lucilius, from inquiring whether it be his
[genius], or the difficult nature of his subject, that will not suffer his verses to be more
finished, and to run more smoothly than if some one, thinking it sufficient to conclude a something
of six feet, be fond of writing two hundred verses before he eats, and as many after supper?
Such was the genius of the Tuscan Cassius, more impetuous than a rapid river; who, as it is
reported, was burned [at the funeral pile] with his own books and papers. Let it be allowed,
I say, that Lucilius was a humorous and polite writer; that he was also more correct than [Ennius],
the author of a kind of poetry [not yet] well cultivated, nor attempted by the Greeks, and
[more correct likewise] than the tribe of our old poets: but yet he, if he had been brought
down by the Fates to this age of ours, would have retrenched a great deal from his writings:
he would have pruned off every thing that transgressed the limits of perfection; and, in the
composition of verses, would often have scratched his head, and bit his nails to the quick.

You that intend to write what is worthy to be read more than once, blot frequently: and take
no-pains to make the multitude admire you, content with a few [judicious] readers. What, would
you be such a fool as to be ambitious that your verses should be taught in petty schools? That
is not my case. It is enough for me, that the knight [Maecenas] applauds: as the courageous
actress, Arbuscula, expressed herself, in contempt of the rest of the audience, when she was
hissed [by the populace]. What, shall that grubworm Pantilius have any effect upon me? Or can
it vex me, that Demetrius carps at me behind my back? or because the trifler Fannius, that
hanger-on to Hermogenes Tigellius, attempts to hurt me? May Plotius and Varius, Maecenas and
Virgil, Valgius and Octavius approve these Satires, and the excellent Fuscus likewise; and
I could wish that both the Visci would join in their commendations: ambition apart, I may mention
you, O Pollio: you also, Messala, together with your brother; and at the same time, you, Bibulus
and Servius; and along with these you, candid Furnius; many others whom, though men of learning
and my friends, I purposely omit--to whom I would wish these Satires, such as they are, may
give satisfaction; and I should be chagrined, if they pleased in a degree below my expectation.
You, Demetrius, and you, Tigellius, I bid lament among the forms of your female pupils.

Go, boy, and instantly annex this Satire to the end of my book.

He supposes himself to consult with Trebatius, whether he should desist from writing satires,
or not.

There are some persons to whom I seem too severe in [the writing of] satire, and to carry it
beyond proper bounds: another set are of opinion, that all I have written is nerveless, and
that a thousand verses like mine may be spun out in a day. Trebatius, give me your advice,
what shall I do. Be quiet. I should not make, you say, verses at all. I do say so. May I be
hanged, if that would not be best: but I can not sleep. Let those, who want sound sleep, anointed

 Nay, from the time that Orestes is deemed to have been of a dangerous disposition,
he did nothing in fact that you can blame; he did not dare to offer violence with his sword
to Pylades, nor to his sister Electra; he only gave ill language to both of them, by calling
her a Fury, and him some other [opprobrious name], which, his violent choler suggested.

Opimius, poor amid silver and gold hoarded up within, who used to drink out of Campanian ware
Veientine wine on holidays, and mere dregs on common days, was some time ago taken with a prodigious
lethargy; insomuch that his heir was already scouring about his coffers and keys, in joy and
triumph. His physician, a man of much dispatch and fidelity, raises him in this manner: he
orders a table to be brought, and the bags of money to be poured out, and several persons to
approach in order to count it: by this method he sets the man upon his legs again. And at the
same time he addresses him to this effect. Unless you guard your money your ravenous heir will
even now carry off these [treasures] of yours. What, while I am alive? That you may live, therefore,
awake; do this. What would you have me do? Why your blood will fail you that are so much reduced,
unless food and some great restorative be administered to your decaying stomach. Do you hesitate?
come on; take this ptisan made of rice. How much did it cost? A trifle. How much then? Eight
asses. Alas! what does it matter, whether I die of a disease, or by theft and rapine?

Who then is sound? He, who is not a fool. What is the covetous man? Both a fool and a madman.
What--if a man be not covetous, is he immediately [to be deemed] sound? By no means. Why so,
Stoic? I will tell you. Such a patient (suppose Craterus [the physician] said this) is not
sick at the heart. Is he therefore well, and shall he get up? No, he will forbid that; because
his side or his reins are harassed with an acute disease. [In like manner], such a man is not
perjured, nor sordid; let him then sacrifice a hog to his propitious household gods. But he
is ambitious and assuming. Let him make a voyage [then] to Anticyra. For what is the difference,
whether you fling whatever you have into a gulf, or make no use of your acquisitions?

Servius Oppidius, rich in the possession of an ancient estate, is reported when dying to have
divided two farms at Canusium between his two sons, and to have addressed the boys, called
to his bed-side, [in the following manner]: When I saw you, Aulus, carry your playthings and
nuts carelessly in your bosom, [and] to give them and game them away; you, Tiberius, count
them, and anxious hide them in holes; I was afraid lest a madness of a different nature should
possess you: lest you [Aulus], should follow the example of Nomentanus, you, [Tiberius], that
of Cicuta. Wherefore each of you, entreated by our household gods, do you (Aulus) take care
lest you lessen; you (Tiberius) lest you make that greater, which your father thinks and the
purposes of nature determine to be sufficient. Further, lest glory should entice you, I will

SATIRE VI.

He sets the conveniences of a country retirement in opposition to the troubles of a life in town.

This was [ever] among the number of my wishes: a portion of ground not over large, in which
was a garden, and a fountain with a continual stream close to my house, and a little Woodland
besides. The gods have done more abundantly, and better, for me [than this]. It is well: O
son of Maia, I ask nothing more save that you would render these donations lasting to me. If
I have neither made my estate larger by bad means, nor am in a way to make it less by vice
or misconduct; if I do not foolishly make any petition of this sort--"Oh that that neighboring
angle, which now spoils the; regularity of my field, could be added! Oh that some accident
would discover to me an urn [full] of money! as it did to him, who having found a treasure,
bought that very ground he before tilled in the capacity of an hired servant, enriched by Hercules'
being his friend;" if what I have at present satisfies me grateful, I supplicate you with this
prayer: make my cattle fat for the use of their master, and every thing else, except my genius:
and, as you are wont, be present as my chief guardian. Wherefore, when I have removed myself
from the city to the mountains and my castle, (what can I polish, preferably to my satires
and prosaic muse?) neither evil ambition destroys me, nor the heavy south wind, nor the sickly
autumn, the gain of baleful Libitina.

Father of the morning, or Janus, if with more pleasure thou hearest thyself [called by that
name], from whom men commence the toils of business, and of life (such is the will of the gods),
be thou the beginning of my song. At Rome you hurry me away to be bail; "Away, dispatch, [you
cry,] lest any one should be beforehand with you in doing that friendly office:" I must go,
at all events, whether the north wind sweep the earth, or winter contracts the snowy day into
a narrower circle. After this, having uttered in a clear and determinate manner [the legal
form], which may be a detriment to me, I must bustle through the crowd; and must disoblige
the tardy. "What is your will, madman, and what are you about, impudent fellow?" So one accosts
me with his passionate curses. "You jostle every thing that is in your way, if with an appointment
full in your mind you are away to Maecenas." This pleases me, and is like honey: I will not
tell a lie. But by the time I reached the gloomy Esquiliae, a hundred affairs of other people's
encompass me on every side: "Roscius begged that you would be with him at the court-house to-morrow
before the second hour." "The secretaries requested you would remember, Quintus, to return
to-day about an affair of public concern, and of great consequence." "Get Maecenas to put his
signet to these tablets." Should one say, "I will endeavor at it:" "If you will, you can,"
adds he; and is more earnest. The seventh year approaching to the eighth is now elapsed, from
the time that Maecenas began to reckon me in the number of his friends; only thus far, as one
he would like to take along with him in his chariot, when he went a journey, and to whom he
would trust such kind of trifles as these: "What is the hour?" "Is Gallina, the Thracian, a
match for [the gladiator] Syrus?" "The cold morning air begins to pinch those that are ill
provided against it;"--and such things-as are well enough intrusted to a leaky ear. For all
this time, every day and hour, I have been more subjected to envy. "Our son of fortune here,
says every body, witnessed the shows in company with [Maecenas], and played with him in the
Campus Martius." Does any disheartening report spread from the rostrum through the streets,
whoever comes in my way consults me [concerning it]: "Good sir, have you (for you must know,
since you approach nearer the gods) heard any thing relating to the Dacians?" "Nothing at all
for my part," [I reply]. "How you ever are a sneerer!" "But may all the gods torture me, if
I know any thing of the matter." "What? will Caesar give the lands he promised the soldiers,
in Sicily, or in Italy?" As I am swearing I know nothing about it, they wonder at me, [thinking]
me, to be sure, a creature of profound and extraordinary secrecy.

Among things of this nature the day is wasted by me, mortified as I am, not without such wishes
as these: O rural retirement, when shall I behold thee? and when shall it be in my power to
pass through the pleasing oblivion of a life full of solicitude, one while with the books of
the ancients, another while in sleep and leisure? O when shall the bean related to Pythagoras,
and at the same time herbs well larded with fat bacon, be set before me? O evenings, and suppers
fit for gods! with which I and my friends regale ourselves in the presence of my household
gods; and feed my saucy slaves with viands, of which libations have been made. The guest, according
to every one's inclination, takes off the glasses of different sizes, free from mad laws: whether
one of a strong constitution chooses hearty bumpers; or another more joyously gets mellow with
moderate ones. Her potency, genre-maker, he made some ground, which, we appear, what was carefully

If now perchance the Roman people should ask me, why I do not enjoy the same sentiments with

I will reply, as the cautious fox once answered the sick lion: "Because the foot-marks all
looking toward you, and none from you, affright me." Thou art a monster with many heads. For
what shall I follow, or whom? One set of men delight to farm the public revenues: there are
some, who would inveigle covetous widows with sweet-meats and fruits, and insnare old men,
whom they would send [like fish] into their ponds: the fortunes of many grow by concealed usury.

More was a Annoyance.


He praises a country before a city life, as more agreeable to nature, and more friendly to liberty.

We, who love the country, salute Fuscus that loves the town; in this point alone [being] much
unlike, but in other things almost twins, of brotherly sentiments: whatever one denies the
other too [denies]; we assent together: like old and constant doves, you keep the nest; I praise
the rivulets, the rocks overgrown with moss, and the groves of the delightful country. Do you
ask why? I live and reign, as soon as I have quitted those things which you extol to the skies
with joyful applause. And, like a priest's, fugitive slave I reject luscious wafers, I desire
plain bread, which is more agreeable now than honied cakes.

If we must live suitably to nature, and a plot of ground is to be first sought to raise a house
upon, do you know any place preferable to the blissful country? Is there any spot where the
winters are more temperate? where a more agreeable breeze moderates the rage of the Dog-star,
and the season of the Lion, when once that furious sign has received the scorching sun? Is
there a place where envious care less disturbs our slumbers? Is the grass inferior in smell
or beauty to the Libyan pebbles? Is the water, which strives to burst the lead in the streets,
purer than that which trembles in murmurs down its sloping channel? Why, trees are nursed along
the variegated columns [of the city]; and that house is commended, which has a prospect of
distant fields. You may drive out nature with a fork, yet still she will return, and, insensibly
victorious, will break through [men's] improper disgusts.

Not he who is unable to compare the fleeces that drink up the dye of Aquinum with the Sidonian
purple, will receive a more certain damage and nearer to his marrow, than he who shall not
be able to distinguish false from true. He who has been overjoyed by prosperity, will be shocked
by a change of circumstances. If you admire any thing [greatly], you will be unwilling to resign
it. Avoid great things; under a mean roof one may outstrip kings, and the favorites of kings,
in one's life.

The stag, superior in fight, drove the horse from the common pasture, till the latter, worsted
in the long contest, implored the aid of man and received the bridle; but after he had parted
an exulting conqueror from his enemy, he could not shake the rider from his back, nor the bit
from his mouth. So he who, afraid of poverty, forfeits his liberty, more valuable than mines,
avaricious wretch, shall carry a master, and shall eternally be a slave, for not knowing how
to use a little. When a man's condition does not suit him, it will be as a shoe at any time;
which, if too big for his foot, will throw him down; if too little, will pinch him. [If you
are] cheerful under your lot, Aristius, you will live wisely; nor shall you let me go uncorrected,
if I appear to scrape together more than enough and not have done. Accumulated money is the
master or slave of each owner, and ought rather to follow than to lead the twisted rope.

These I dictated to thee behind the moldering temple of Vacuna; in all other things happy,
except that thou wast not with me.

However, whether you murder fishes, or onions and garlic, receive Pompeius Grosphus; and, if

But that you may not be ignorant in what situation the Roman affairs are; the Cantabrians have

TO VINNIUS ASINA.

Horace cautions him to present his poems to Augustus at a proper opportunity, and with due decorum.

As on your setting out I frequently and fully gave you instructions, Vinnius, that you would
present these volumes to Augustus sealed up if he shall be in health, if in spirits, finally,
if he shall ask for them: do not offend out of zeal to me, and industriously bring an odium
upon my books [by being] an agent of violent officiousness. If haply the heavy load of my paper
should gall you, cast it from you, rather than throw down your pack in a rough manner where
you are directed to carry it, and turn your paternal name of Asina into a jest, and make yourself
a common story. Make use of your vigor over the hills, the rivers, and the fens. As soon as
you have achieved your enterprise, and arrived there, you must keep your burden in this position;
lest you happen to carry my bundle of books under your arm, as a clown does a lamb, or as drunken
Pyrrhia [in the play does] the balls of pilfered wool, or as a tribe-guest his slippers with
his fuddling-cap. You must not tell publicly, how you sweated with carrying those verses, which
may detain the eyes and ears of Caesar. Solicited with much entreaty, do your best. Finally,
get you gone, farewell: take care you do not stumble, and break my orders.

eager to return to Rome.

Steward of my woodlands and little farm that restores me to myself, which you despise, [though
formerly] inhabited by five families, and wont to send five good senators to Varia: let us
try, whether I with more fortitude pluck the thorns out of my mind, or you out of my ground:
and whether Horace or his estate be in a better condition.

Though my affection and solicitude for Lamia, mourning for his brother, lamenting inconsolably
for his brother's loss, detain me; nevertheless my heart and soul carry me thither and long
to break through those barriers that obstruct my way. I pronounce him the happy man who dwells
in the country, you him [who lives] in the city. He to whom his neighbor's lot is agreeable,

Him whom pernicious lust, whom quick-dispatching dice strips, whom vanity dresses out and perfumes
beyond his abilities, whom insatiable hunger and thirst after money, Whom a shame and aversion
to poverty possess, his rich friend (though furnished with a half-score more vices) hates and
abhors; or if he does not hate, governs him; and, like a pious mother, would have him more
wise and virtuous than himself; and says what is nearly true: "My riches (think not to emulate
me) admit of extravagance; your income is but small: a scanty gown becomes a prudent dependant:
cease to vie with me." Whomsoever Eutrapelus had a mind to punish, he presented with costly
garments. For now [said he] happy in his fine clothes, he will assume new schemes and hopes;
he will sleep till daylight; prefer a harlot to his honest-calling; run into debt; and at last
become a gladiator, or drive a gardener's hack for hire.

Do not you at any time pry into his secrets; and keep close what is intrusted to you, though
put to the torture, by wine or passion. Neither commend your own inclinations, nor find fault
with those of others; nor, when he is disposed to hunt, do you make verses. For by such means
the amity of the twins Zethus and Amphion, broke off; till the lyre, disliked by the austere
brother, was silent. Amphion is thought to have given way to his brother's humors; so do you
yield to the gentle dictates of your friend in power: as often as he leads forth his dogs into
the fields and his cattle laden with Aetolian nets, arise and lay aside the peevishness of
your unmannerly muse, that you may sup together on the delicious fare purchased by your labor;
an exercise habitual to the manly Romans, of service to their fame and life and limbs: especially
when you are in health, and are able either to excel the dog in swiftness, or the boar in strength.
Add [to this], that there is no one who handles martial weapons more gracefully. You well know,
with what acclamations of the spectators you sustain the combats in the Campus Marcius: in
fine, as yet a boy, you endured a bloody campaign and the Cantabrian wars, beneath a commander,
who is now replacing the standards [recovered] from the Parthian temples: and, if any thing
is wanting, assigns it to the Roman arms. And that you may not withdraw yourself, and inexcusably
be absent; though you are careful to do nothing out of measure, and moderation, yet you sometimes
amuse yourself at your country-seat. The [mock] fleet divides the little boats [into two squadrons]:
the Actian sea-fight is represented by boys under your direction in a hostile form: your brother
is the foe, your lake the Adriatic; till rapid victory crowns the one or the other with her
bays. Your patron, who will perceive that you come into his taste, will applaud your sports
with both his hands.

Moreover, that I may advise you (if in aught you stand in need of an adviser), take great circumspection
what you say to any man, and to whom. Avoid an inquisitive impertinent, for such a one is also
a tattler, nor do open ears faithfully retain what is intrusted to them; and a word, once sent
abroad, flies irrevocably.

Let no slave within the marble threshold of your honored friend inflame your heart; lest the
owner of the beloved damsel gratify you with so trifling a present, or, mortifying [to your
wishes], torment you [with a refusal].

Look over and over again [into the merits of] such a one, as you recommend; lest afterward
the faults of others strike you with shame. We are sometimes imposed upon, and now and then
introduce an unworthy person. Wherefore, once deceived, forbear to defend one who suffers by
his own bad conduct; but protect one whom you entirely know, and with confidence guard him
with your patronage, if false accusations attack him: who being bitten with the tooth of calumny,
do you not perceive that the same danger is threatening you? For it is your own concern, when
the adjoining wall is on fire: and flames neglected are wont to gain strength.

The attending of the levee of a friend in power seems delightful to the unexperienced; the
experienced dreads it. Do you, while your vessel is in the main, ply your business, lest a
changing gale bear you back again.

 Yet neither do Virgil and Varius, your beloved poets, disgrace your judgment
of them, and the presents which they have received with great honor to the donor; nor do the
features of illustrious men appear more lively when expressed by statues of brass, than their
manners and minds expressed by the works of a poet. Nor would I rather compose such tracts
as these creeping on the ground, than record deeds of arms, and the situations of countries,
and rivers, and forts reared upon mountains, and barbarous kingdoms, and wars brought to a
conclusion through the whole world under your auspices, and the barriers that confine Janus
the guardian of peace, and Rome treaded by the Parthians under your government, if I were but
able to do as much as I could wish. But neither does your majesty admit of humble poetry, nor
dares my modesty attempt a subject which my strength is unable to support. Yet officiousness
foolishly disgusts the person whom it loves; especially when it recommends itself by numbers,
and the art [of writing]. For one learns sooner, and more willingly remembers, that which a
man derides, than that which he approves and venerates. I value not the zeal that gives me
uneasiness; nor do I wish to be set out any where in wax with a face formed for the worse,
nor to be celebrated in ill-composed verses; lest I blush, when presented with the gross gift;
and, exposed in an open box along with my author, be conveyed into the street that sells frankincense,
and spices, and pepper, and whatever is wrapped up in impertinent writings.

In apologizing for not having written to him, he shows that the well-ordering of life is of
more importance than the composition of verses.

O Florus, faithful friend to the good and illustrious Nero, if by chance any one should offer
to sell you a boy born at Tibur and Gabii, and should treat with you in this manner; "This
[boy who is] both good-natured and well-favored from head to foot, shall become and be yours
for eight thousand sesterces; a domestic slave, ready in his attendance at his master's nod;
initiated in the Greek language, of a capacity for any art; you may shape out any thing with
[such] moist clay; besides, he will sing in an artless manner, but yet entertaining to one

 As the human countenance smiles on those that
smile, so does it sympathize with those that weep. If you would have me weep you must first
express the passion of grief yourself; then, Telephus or Peleus, your misfortunes hurt me:
if you pronounce the parts assigned you ill, I shall either fall asleep or laugh.

Pathetic accents suit a melancholy countenance; words full of menace, an angry one; wanton
expressions, a sportive look; and serious matter, an austere one. For nature forms us first
within to every modification of circumstances; she delights or impels us to anger, or depresses
us to the earth and afflicts us with heavy sorrow: then expresses those emotions of the mind
by the tongue, its interpreter. If the words be discordant to the station of the speaker, the
Roman knights and plebians will raise an immoderate laugh. It will make a wide difference,
whether it be Davus that speaks, or a hero; a man well-stricken in years, or a hot young fellow
in his bloom; and a matron of distinction, or an officious nurse; a roaming merchant, or the
cultivator of a verdant little farm; a Colchian, or an Assyrian; one educated at Thebes, or
one at Argos.

You, that write, either follow tradition, or invent such fables as are congruous to themselves.
If as poet you have to represent the renowned Achilles; let him be indefatigable, wrathful,

Let a play which would be inquired after, and though seen, represented anew, be neither shorter
nor longer than the fifth act. Neither let a god interfere, unless a difficulty worthy a god's
unraveling should happen; nor let a fourth person be officious to speak.

Let the chorus sustain the part and manly character of an actor: nor let them sing any thing
between the acts which is not conducive to, and fitly coherent with, the main design. Let them
both patronize the good, and give them friendly advice, and regulate the passionate, and love
to appease those who swell [with rage]: let them praise the repast of a short meal, and salutary
effects of justice, laws, and peace with her open gates; let them conceal what is told to them

 Such power has a just arrangement and connection of the parts: such grace may be added
to subjects merely common. In my judgment the Fauns, that are brought out of the woods, should
not be too gamesome with their tender strains, as if they were educated in the city, and almost
at the bar; nor, on the other hand; should blunder out their obscene and scandalous speeches. Anthony
à Forest, and has the century, say that the happening were do in Lust Merton on Life, from Walls'Tomorrow,

1648, Merton freshmen be entertained of a co-ed to lavatory "full customs of cawdel." Forest,
who was the constitutions, picture how "the lowerclassman according to seniority, was to tweak

was practised in Shoe. Hearne last of similar americanism at Balliol and at Brasenose, and
rage into an eighteenth-century of Bentwood asseverate, that "striking
flicker" of practice "may be bury in a societies in place, and in

Our quotation into Ulysses from Bentwood may therefore function to exemplify of treatment for associates

 He who has learned what he owes to his country, and what

[I say,] certainly knows how to give suitable attributes to every character. I should direct
the learned imitator to have a regard to the mode of nature and manners, and thence draw his
expressions to the life. Sometimes a play, that is showy with common-places, and where the
manners are well marked, though of no elegance, without force or art, gives the people much
higher delight and more effectually commands their attention, than verse void of matter, and
tuneful trifles.
