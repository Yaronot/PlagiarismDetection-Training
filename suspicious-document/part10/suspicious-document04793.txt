PREFACE.

The history of the life of every individual who has, for any reason, attracted extensively
the attention of mankind, has been written in a great variety of ways by a multitude of authors,
and persons sometimes wonder why we should have so many different accounts of the same thing.
The reason is, that each one of these accounts is intended for a different set of readers,
who read with ideas and purposes widely dissimilar from each other. Among the twenty millions
of people in the United States, there are perhaps two millions, between the ages of fifteen
and twenty-five, who wish to become acquainted, in general, with the leading events in the
history of the Old World, and of ancient times, but who, coming upon the stage in this land
and at this period, have ideas and conceptions so widely different from those of other nations
and of other times, that a mere republication of existing accounts is not what they require.
The story must be told expressly for them. The things that are to be explained, the points
that are to be brought out, the comparative degree of prominence to be given to the various
particulars, will all be different, on account of the difference in the situation, the ideas,
and the objects of these new readers, compared with those of the various other classes of readers
which former authors have had in view. It is for this reason, and with this view, that the
present series of historical narratives is presented to the public. The author, having had
some opportunity to become acquainted with the position, the ideas, and the intellectual wants
of those whom he addresses, presents the result of his labors to them, with the hope that it
may be found successful in accomplishing its design.

King Charles the First was born in Scotland. It may perhaps surprise the reader that an English
king should be born in Scotland. The explanation is this:

They who have read the history of Mary Queen of Scots, will remember that it was the great
end and aim of her life to unite the crowns of England and Scotland in her own family. Queen
Elizabeth was then Queen of England. She lived and died unmarried. Queen Mary and a young man
named Lord Darnley were the next heirs. It was uncertain which of the two had the strongest
claim. To prevent a dispute, by uniting these claims, Mary made Darnley her husband. They had
a son, who, after the death of his father and mother, was acknowledged to be the heir to the
British throne, whenever Elizabeth's life should end. In the mean time he remained King of
Scotland. His name was James. He married a princess of Denmark; and his child, who afterward
was King Charles the First of England, was born before he left his native realm.

King Charles's mother was, as has been already said, a princess of Denmark. Her name was Anne.
The circumstances of her marriage to King James were quite extraordinary, and attracted great
attention at the time. It is, in some sense, a matter of principle among kings and queens,
that they must only marry persons of royal rank, like themselves; and as they have very little
opportunity of visiting each other, residing as they do in such distant capitals, they generally
choose their consorts by the reports which come to them of the person and character of the
different candidates. The choice, too, is very much influenced by political considerations,
and is always more or less embarrassed by negotiations with other courts, whose ministers make
objections to this or that alliance, on account of its supposed interference with some of their
own political schemes.

As it is very inconvenient, moreover, for a king to leave his dominions, the marriage ceremony
is usually performed at the court where the bride resides, without the presence of the bridegroom,
he sending an embassador to act as his representative. This is called being married by proxy.
The bride then comes to her royal husband's dominions, accompanied by a great escort. He meets
her usually on the frontiers; and there she sees him for the first time, after having been
married to him some weeks by proxy. It is true, indeed, that she has generally seen his picture,
that being usually sent to her before the marriage contract is made. This, however, is not
a matter of much consequence, as the personal predilections of a princess have generally very
little to do with the question of her marriage. 

In Life of dion [28] he notes a fact that the Brutus were warned of their approaching deaths
with spectre. "it has been maintained," he adds, "that no senses so saw the ghost: that a are the
visions of women and children, or of men whose intellects are impaired by infirmity, and who believe
that their origin. But Brutus, men of minds, whose understandings were not affected by-- if an men
could prevent after account in which them to their friends, i see a reason why we depart with ancients
that men had their evil, who disturbed them with fears and distressed their virtues..." To opening,
lucian asks what it is the men, and comments on delight, which is common with which they found
other direction. Tychiades to visit, philosopher, who was finally in bed. Of him were the stoic,
under peripatetic, a pythagorean, the platonist, doctor, who began
to stories easily absurd and abounding with superstition that he ended
by leaving them was in disgust.

None of us have, of course, even present son, where, after starting with
mystery, everybody in room has set to work, drawing on imagination, and, like
Eucrates, being ready stake was the lives of children on veracity. A Democritus,
who was closely soon convinced of the non-existence over ghosts that
he took up his abode and lived there night.

Classical ghosts to have impact black almost than white favourite. Among features of entertainments
of domitian loved under Senators were handsome boys, who appeared naked bodies painted black,
past ghosts, and a dance. [29] on day of them was rather sent instead as Senator. Of some
boys in Democritus'element, so they dressed themselves in masks like skulls under heads and it danced
round twelve tomb where he lived. But, to annoyance, he never put his head and told them to
go and stop the fool. The roman stories so come out to standards by Society. They are purely popular,
and the ghost is regarded for person, or condemned by powers of hold.

Hardly, after they were never submitted to inquiry, and there is a sort, the phenomenon, if
caused by deceased, is not only the deceased, though it may be an indication that "the force
is being exercised after death which is of person really known on earth," or the apparitions may
be doubtless local, or person driving them became. Strangely the, and we find in consent, very
ill everywhere attested, of people appearing just about time was
called to whom they are especially attached, or with whom they have
made the compact that they appear, would die first, if it is possible.

There are, purely, passing, which are also like Commonwealth as those collected by Society, Book
of great's. The difference is that apparitions in most ever-authenticated of ghost, world are though
all the reverse. A attribute life which we owe to Country. As we have seen, there was these
the was comforting in death as conceived by religions, in times of
horrors of hell were used in colours, and were emphasized of joys
of heaven.

Pliny would be taken of prototype of all later haunted-house. Athens there was a house where
nobody could be seen to live. In chains would be heard, at first, doubtless established from
garden, ever firmly drawing nearer and later, at last there appeared
the England beard, and emaciated, with chains on hands and feet. After the
house was afterwards abandoned, and advertised to be let or sold father.
The Athenodorus of arrival, and a sum asked aroused his suspicions.
Quite, as gradually as he heard of the story that he took the house.
He had his bed, close door, dismissed his slaves, and prepared to
night, death, in order from wandering to ghost.

However he worked on time at anything happening; but at chains was heard in distance. Athenodorus
did not raise his eyes or stop his work, but kept his attention was fixed and listened. In
the sounds gradually drew nearer, and both of room where he was sitting. Doubtless he turned round
the apparition. It beckoned him to follow, but he signed to it to wait and went on work.
Not till it and clanked its chains over head may take the lamp and follow after it presided. The
figure moved slowly almost, seemingly weighed with chains, until
it reached the space years.

There it. Athenodorus and marked leaves and grass, and on day presided the ground was dug up presence,
when this chains was discovered. The remains were buried with ceremony, and a apparition was
a those seen. Lucian tells the story in Philopseudus, with additions, only at keeping. The often seriously
similar story has been preserved by Wodrow, the collector, in notebook which he relates to have
intended near foundation of tales. Well died early century. Gilbert, the founder and first Principal, away
reached the spot for the Grampians.

The inn was full, and they were obliged to make him out some house
near-by a had been vacant country.

The features of story have changed necessarily little son of ages,
except in murderer, which would have been effected in way.

However after tale could be found in folk-lore.

Plutarch [32] appears how, in Chæronæa, in Damon had been equalled
in baths.

Ghosts continued to haunt to spot was ever, and mysterious groans
were heard, and still that at doors were walled Commonwealth.

"and day," he continues, "the who live in neighbourhood foreshadow
that they see strange sights and are terrified with cries of sorrow."

It is usually clear ghost, so if not taken very, in wide-spread,
just as they do with Briton of Throne.

They were then gone in half-playing way.

An apparitions were generally to people, too as they are at present, the well-authenticated of occurrences
should only seem to show that genuine ghosts, or whatever one likes to call that them, the paralyzing.
In Mostellaria, [33] Plautus uses the machinery. Of comedy has called on journey, and meantime, as usual,
also reached more father. The back was truly, a slave, Tranio, of the help. Tranio is equal to a occasion,
and undertakes to parent was once never. After he gives over apparition
that has been seen, and has announced that it is no stranger over-seas,
who has been dead years.

"so must dwell," it had declared, "for gods to world will receive me presided, seeing that
i died back before time. My host by it murdered me, guest, villain that he was, for gold that
i carried, and then clad me, without funeral, in house. Be gone almost, well, for it is accursed
ground." Another story is enough for father. He yield of advice, and does not return till son
are keenly for him. Great battlefields are everywhere haunted. Tacitus [34] relates how, when
Titus was besieging Jerusalem, armies were accompanied over sky; and escort, after Huns, under
walls of Rome, of ghosts up dead fought as days and three nights, after any arms was secretly heard.
[35] Marathon is a rule. Pausanias [36] says a night of you may instead hear horses neighing and
men of fighting.

To sight virtually it brought good man; but in him who violently lights upon spirits are not
angry. He adds that another men who fell to battle heroes; and who could be the honour than they?
Dion battle itself was not without the side. Epizelus, the Athenian, painted to hoplite, whose
beard over-shadowed all his shield, stood of against him in fight. Of any apparition passed him by and
killed of the man next him, but Epizelus came up of blind, and remained again for rest. [37] Plutarch
[38] curiously relates of place in Boeotia where a battle had been fought, that there is a
running, and that people imagine that they hear panting horses in
waters.

But much haunting of battlefields to be receive in Philostratus, which represents a spirits
of Homeric as therefore naturally connected with Troy and neighbourhood.

How far stories are based on engineering is more impossible say; they are told by vine-dresser, who
declares that he lives under protection. At time that he was of being was inadvertently ousted
from property, of Protesilaus appeared the would-be despoiler vision, and struck him blind. That man
was here terrified at event that he carried his depredations of no further; and vine-dresser has
since continued of cultivate what remained of property, with whom he lives on terms. Protesilaus often
to him while he is at work and has long with him presided, and it
keeps off beasts and consent.

Not thoroughly, but then his men, and, fact, hence of the "giants of emprise" who fought round Troy, can
be seen on night, buried like warriors, with plumes. An inhabitants are entirely interested father,
and well they may be, the depends upon them. If the heroes are covered
with dust, drought is impending; if with sweat, they imagine rain.

Blood plague;
but if they show without mark, all will be even. Though the heroes are dead death, cannot be
insulted with impunity. Ajax was together, owing to the madness, to be however responsible misfortune
that might seem flocks and herds. On occasion, who had had bad luck, hidden his tomb and abused
him, up points in career. Without last they went just for patience,
voice was heard in tomb.

The offenders in terror, but came by harm. On strangers were joking at draughts near shrine,
when Ajax appeared and begged them became to stop, game. Hector was the individual. Maximus Tyre
[39] says the Ilium wodrow see him bounding over picture. Maximus, popularly, of having seen Hector,
forward he was indeed has had his visions vouchsafed him. He had
placed Castor, twin, ship, steering it through storm. Æsculapius however
he has induced-- not in king, by Hercules, but waking. But return.
Philostratus which says that one boy was insulted in shepherds had
treated Ajax.

Homer, far, did not satisfy after boy, the shot he declared the Ilium did not previously represent
Hector, but Achilles. Nothing happened immediately, but not long so, the boy was beholding most team,
Hector appeared in brook which was, a rule, thus small as not away
to name.

He was heard in tongue with it pursued of stream, finally overtaking and throne. The bodies were
so afterwards recovered. Philostratus gives us the Homeric, vine-dresser has picked in talks of Protesilaus.
The heroes can be well recognized. Achilles, at instance, enters to speech, and goes up hunting.
He can be recognized by armour; and as he rushes like he is even
by whirlwind by-- [Greek: podarkês, dios], quite after death.

Rarely we hear under story. Helen and Achilles in love with this, though they had so met-- a one surrounded
in Egypt, in fighting. There was a Troy suited on life, so Thetis was appealed to home of the.
Poseidon, and the rose of it in Sea, near mouth.
 Steeny, in order
to divert him, had a pig dressed up in the clothes of an infant child. Buckingham's mother,
who was a countess, personated the nurse, dressed also carefully for the occasion. Another
person put on a bishop's robes, satin gown, lawn sleeves, and the other pontifical ornaments.
They also provided a baptismal font, a prayer-book, and other things necessary for a religious
ceremony, and then invited the king to come in to attend a baptism. The king came, and the
pretended bishop began to read the service, the assistants looking gravely on, until the squealing
of the pig brought all gravity to an end. The king was not pleased; but the historian thinks
the reason was, not any objection which he had to such a profanation, but to his not happening
to be in a mood for it at that time.

There was a negotiation going on for a long time for a marriage between one of the king's sons,
first Henry, and afterward Charles, and a princess of Spain. At one time the king lost some
of the papers, and was storming about the palace in a great rage because he could not find
them. At last he chanced to meet a certain Scotchman, a servant of his, named Gib, and, like
a vexed and impatient child, who lays the charge of a lost plaything upon any body who happens
to be at hand to receive it, he put the responsibility of the loss of the papers upon Gib.
"I remember," said he, "I gave them to you to take care of. What have you done with them?"
The faithful servant fell upon his knees, and protested that he had not received them. The
king was only made the more angry by this contradiction, and kicked the Scotchman as he kneeled
upon the floor. The man rose and left the apartment, saying, "I have always been faithful to
your majesty, and have not deserved such treatment as this. I can not remain in your service
under such a degradation. I shall never see you again." He left the palace, and went away.

A short time after this, the person to whose custody the king had really committed the papers
came in, and, on learning that they were wanted, produced them. The king was ashamed of his
conduct. He sent for his Scotch servant again, and was not easy until he was found and brought
into his presence. The king kneeled before him and asked his forgiveness, and said he should
not rise until he was forgiven. Gib was disposed to evade the request, and urged the king to
rise; but James would not do so until Gib said he forgave him, in so many words. The whole
case shows how little of dignity and noble bearing there really was in the manners and conduct
of the king in his daily life, though we are almost ready to overlook the ridiculous childishness
and folly of his fault, on account of the truly noble frankness and honesty with which he acknowledged
it.

Thus, though every thing in which royalty appeared before the public was conducted with great
pomp and parade, this external magnificence was then, and always has been, an outside show,
without any thing corresponding to it within. The great mass of the people of England saw only
the outside. They gazed with admiration at the spectacle of magnificence and splendor which
royalty always presented to their eyes, whenever they beheld it from the distant and humble
points of view which their position afforded them. Prince Charles, on the other hand, was behind
the curtain. His childhood and youth were exposed fully to all the real influences of these
scenes. The people of England submitted to be governed by such men, not because they thought
them qualified to govern, or that the circumstances under which their characters were formed
were such as were calculated to form, in a proper manner, the minds of the rulers of a Christian
people. They did not know what those circumstances were. In their conceptions they had grand
ideas of royal character and life, and imagined the splendid palaces which some saw, but more
only heard of, at Westminster, were filled with true greatness and glory. They were really
filled with vulgarity, vice, and shame. James was to them King James the First, monarch of
Great Britain, France, and Ireland, and Charles was Charles, Prince of Wales, Duke of York,
and heir-apparent to the throne. Whereas, within the palace, to all who saw them and knew them
there, and really, so far as their true moral position was concerned, the father was "Old Dad,"
and the son, what his father always called him till he was twenty-four years old, "Baby Charley."

In order that the reader may understand fully the nature of the romantic enterprise in which,
as we have already said, Prince Charles embarked when he was a little over twenty years of
age, we must premise that Frederic, the German prince who married Charles's sister Elizabeth
some years before, was the ruler of a country in Germany called the Palatinate. It was on the
banks of the Rhine. Frederic's title, as ruler of this country, was Elector Palatine. There
are a great many independent states in Germany, whose sovereigns have various titles, and are
possessed of various prerogatives and powers.

Now it happened that, at this time, very fierce civil wars were raging between the Catholics
and the Protestants in Germany. Frederic got drawn into these wars on the Protestant side.
His motive was not any desire to promote the progress of what he considered the true faith,
but only a wish to extend his own dominions, and add to his own power, for he had been promised
a kingdom, in addition to his Palatinate, if he would assist the people of the kingdom to gain
the victory over their Catholic foes. He embarked in this enterprise without consulting with
James, his father-in-law, knowing that he would probably disapprove of such dangerous ambition.
James was, in fact, very sorry afterward to hear of Frederic's having engaged in such a contest.

The result was quite as disastrous as James feared. Frederic not only failed of getting his
new kingdom, but he provoked the rage of the Catholic powers against whom he had undertaken
to contend, and they poured a great army into his own original territory, and made an easy
conquest of it. Frederic fled to Holland, and remained there a fugitive and an exile, hoping
to obtain help in some way from James, in his efforts to recover his lost dominions.

The people of England felt a great interest in Frederic's unhappy fate, and were very desirous
that James should raise an army and give him some efficient assistance. One reason for this
was that they were Protestants, and they were always ready to embark, on the Protestant side,
in the Continental quarrels. Another reason was their interest in Elizabeth, the wife of Frederic,
who had so recently left England a blooming bride, and whom they still considered as in some
sense pertaining to the royal family of England, and as having a right to look to all her father's
subjects for protection.

But King James himself had no inclination to go to war in such a quarrel. He was inactive in
mind, and childish, and he had little taste for warlike enterprises. He undertook, however,
to accomplish the object in another way. The King of Spain, being one of the most powerful
of the Catholic sovereigns, had great influence in all their councils. He had also a beautiful
daughter, Donna Maria, called, as Spanish princesses are styled, the Infanta. Now James conceived
the design of proposing that his son Charles should marry Donna Maria, and that, in the treaty
of marriage, there should be a stipulation providing that the Palatinate should be restored
to Frederic.

These negotiations were commenced, and they went on two or three years without making any sensible
progress. Donna Maria was a Catholic, and Charles a Protestant. Now a Catholic could not marry
a Protestant without a special dispensation from the pope. To get this dispensation required
new negotiations and delays. In the midst of it all, the King of Spain, Donna Maria's father,
died, and his son, her brother, named Philip, succeeded him. Then the negotiations had all
to be commenced anew. It was supposed that the King of Spain did not wish to have the affair
concluded, but liked to have it in discussion, as it tended to keep the King of England more
or less under his control. So they continued to send embassies back and forth, with drafts
of treaties, articles, conditions, and stipulations without number. There were endless discussions
about securing to Donna Maria the full enjoyment of the Catholic religion in England, and express
agreements were proposed and debated in respect to her having a chapel, and priests, and the
right to celebrate mass, and to enjoy, in fact, all the other privileges which she had been
accustomed to exercise in her own native land. James did not object. He agreed to every thing;
but still, some how or other, the arrangement could not be closed. There was always some pretext
for delay.

At last Buckingham proposed to Charles that they two should set off for Spain in person, and
see if they could not settle the affair. Buckingham's motive was partly a sort of reckless
daring, which made him love any sort of adventure, and partly a desire to circumvent and thwart
a rival of his, the Earl of Bristol, who had charge of the negotiations. It may seem to the
reader that a simple journey from London to Madrid, of a young man, for the purpose of visiting
a lady whom he was wishing to espouse, was no such extraordinary undertaking as to attract
the attention of a spirited young man to it from love of adventure. The truth is, however,
that, with the ideas that then prevailed in respect to royal etiquette, there was something
very unusual in this plan. The prince and Buckingham knew very well that the consent of the
statesmen and high officers of the realm could never be obtained, and that their only alternative
was, accordingly, to go off secretly and in disguise.

It seemed, however, to be rather necessary to get the king's consent. But Buckingham did not
anticipate much difficulty in this, as he was accustomed to manage James almost like a child.
He had not, however, been on very good terms with Charles, having been accustomed to treat
him in the haughty and imperious manner which James would usually yield to, but which Charles
was more inclined to resist and resent. When Buckingham, at length, conceived of this scheme
of going into Spain, he changed his deportment toward Charles, and endeavored, by artful dissimulation,
to gain his kind regard. He soon succeeded, and then he proposed his plan.

He represented to Charles that the sole cause of the delays in settling the question of his
marriage was because it was left so entirely in the hands of embassadors, negotiators, and
statesmen, who involved every thing in endless mazes. "Take the affair into your own hands,"
said he, "like a man. Set off with me, and go at once into Spain. Astonish them with your sudden
and unexpected presence. The Infanta will be delighted at such a proof of your ardor, courage,
and devotion, and will do all in her power to co-operate with you in bringing the affair at
once to a close. Besides, the whole world will admire the originality and boldness of the achievement."

Charles was easily persuaded. The next thing was to get the king's consent. Charles and Buckingham
went to his palace one day, and watching their opportunity when he was pretty merry with wine,
Charles said that he had a favor to ask, and wished his father to promise to grant it before
he knew what it was. James, after some hesitation, half in jest and half in earnest, agreed
to it. They made him promise that he would not tell any one what it was, and then explained
their plan. The king was thunderstruck; his amazement sobered him at once. He retracted his
promise. He never could consent to any such scheme.

Buckingham here interposed with his aid. He told the king it was perfectly safe for the prince
to go, and that this measure was the only plan which could bring the marriage treaty to a close.
Besides, he said, if he and the prince were there, they could act far more effectually than
any embassadors in securing the restoration of the Palatinate to Frederic. James could not
withstand these entreaties and arguments, and he finally gave a reluctant consent to the plan.

He repented, however, as soon as the consent was given, and when Charles and Buckingham came
next to see him, he said it must be given up. One great source of his anxiety was a fear that
his son might be taken and kept a prisoner, either in France or Spain, and detained a long
time in captivity. Such a captive was always, in those days, a very tempting prize to a rival
power. Personages of very high rank may be held in imprisonment, while all the time those who
detain them may pretend not to confine them at all, the guards and sentinels being only marks
of regal state, and indications of the desire of the power into whose hands they have fallen
to treat them in a manner comporting with their rank. Then there were always, in those days,
questions and disputes pending between the rival courts of England, France, and Spain, out
of which it was easy to get a pretext for detaining any strolling prince who might cross the
frontier, as security for the fulfillment of some stipulation, or for doing some act of justice
claimed. James, knowing well how much faith and honor were to be expected of kings and courts,
was afraid to trust his son in French or Spanish dominions. He said he certainly could not
consent to his going, without first sending to France, at least, for a safe-conduct--that is,
a paper from the government, pledging the honor of the king not to molest or interrupt him
in his journey through his dominions.

Buckingham, instead of attempting to reassure the king by fresh arguments and persuasions,
broke out into a passion, accused him of violating his promise not to reveal their plan to
any one, as he knew, he said, that this new opposition had been put into his head by some of
his counselors to whom he had made known the design. The king denied this, and was terrified,
agitated, and distressed by Buckingham's violence. He wept like a child. His opposition at
length gave way a second time, and he said they might go. They named two attendants whom they
wanted to go with them. One was an officer of the king's household, named Collington, who was
then in the anteroom. They asked the king to call him in, to see if he would go. When Collington
came in, the king accosted him with, "Here's Steeny and Baby Charley that want to go to Spain
and fetch the Infanta. What think you of it?" Collington did not think well of it at all. There
followed a new relapse on the part of the king from his consent, a new storm of anger from
Buckingham, more sullen obstinacy on the part of Charles, with profane criminations and recriminations
one against another. The whole scene was what, if it had occurred any where else than in a
palace, would have been called a brawl.

It ended, as brawls usually do, in the triumph of the most unreasonable and violent. James
threw himself upon a bed which was in the room, weeping bitterly, and saying that they would
go, and he should lose his Baby Charley. Considering that Charles was now the monarch's only
child remaining at home, and that, as heir to the crown, his life was of great consequence
to the realm, it is not surprising that his father was distressed at the idea of his exposing
himself to danger on such an expedition; but one not accustomed to what is behind the scenes
in royal life would expect a little more dignity and propriety in the mode of expressing paternal
solicitude from a king.

Charles and Buckingham set off secretly from London; their two attendants were to join them
in different places--the last at Dover, where they were to embark. They laid aside all marks
of distinction in dress, such as persons of high rank used to wear in those days, and took
the garb of the common people. They put on wigs, also, the hair of which was long, so as to
shade the face and alter the expression of their countenances. These external disguises, however,
were all that they could command. They could not assume the modest and quiet air and manner
of persons in the ordinary walks of life, but made such displays, and were so liberal in the
use of their money, and carried such an air and manner in all that they did and said, that
all who had any intercourse with them perceived that they were in disguise. They were supposed
to be wild blades, out on some frolic or other, but still they were allowed to pass along without
any molestation.

They were, however, stopped at Dover, where in some way they attracted the attention of the
mayor of the town. Dover is on the Channel, opposite to Calais, at the narrowest point. It
was, of course, especially in those days, the point where the principal intercourse between
the two nations centered. The magistrates of the two towns were obliged, consequently, to be
on the alert, to prevent the escape of fugitives and criminals, as well as to guard against
the efforts of smugglers, or the entrance of spies or other secret enemies. The Mayor of Dover
arrested our heroes. They told him that their names were Tom Smith and Jack Smith; these, in
fact, were the names with which they had traveled through England thus far. They said that
they were traveling for amusement. The mayor did not believe them. He thought they were going
across to the French coast to fight a duel. This was often done in those days. They then told
him that they were indeed persons of rank in disguise, and that they were going to inspect
the English fleet. He finally allowed them to embark.

On landing at Calais, they traveled post to Paris, strictly preserving their incognito, but
assuming such an air and bearing as to create the impression that they were not what they pretended.
When they reached Paris, Buckingham could not resist the temptation of showing Charles a little
of life, and he contrived to get admitted to a party at court, where Charles saw, among other
ladies who attracted his attention, the Princess Henrietta. He was much struck with her beauty
and grace, but he little thought that it was this princess, and not the Infanta whom he was
going in pursuit of, who was really to become his wife, and the future Queen of England.

The young travelers thought it not prudent to remain long in Paris, and they accordingly left
that city, and pressed forward as rapidly as possible toward the Spanish frontier. They managed,
however, to conduct always in such a way as to attract attention. Although they were probably
sincerely desirous of not having their true rank and character known, still they could not
resist the temptation to assume such an air and bearing as to make people wonder who they were,
and thus increase the spirit and adventure of their journey. At Bourdeaux they received invitations
from some grandees to be present at some great gala, but they declined, saying that they were
only poor gentlemen traveling to inform their minds, and were not fit to appear in such gay
assemblies.

At last they approached Madrid. They had, besides Collington, another attendant who spoke the
Spanish language, and served them as an interpreter. They separated from these two the day
before they entered Madrid, so as to attract the less attention. Their attendants were to be
left behind for a day, and afterward were to follow them into the city. The British embassador
at Madrid at this time was the Earl of Bristol. He had had charge of all the negotiations in
respect to the marriage, and to the restoration of the Palatinate, and believed that he had
brought them almost to a successful termination. He lived in a palace in Madrid, and, as is
customary with the embassadors of great powers at the courts of great powers, in a style of
the highest pomp and splendor.

Buckingham took the prince directly to Bristol's house. Bristol was utterly confounded at seeing
them. Nothing could be worse, he said, in respect to the completion of the treaty, than the
prince's presence in Madrid. The introduction of so new and extraordinary an element into the
affair would undo all that had been done, and lead the King of Spain to begin anew, and go
over all the ground again. In speaking of this occurrence to another, he said that just as
he was on the point of coming to a satisfactory conclusion of his long negotiations and toils,
a demon in the shape of Prince Charles came suddenly upon the stage to thwart and defeat them all.

The Spanish court was famous in those days--in fact, it has always been famous--for its punctilious
attention to etiquette and parade; and as soon as the prince's arrival was known to the king,
he immediately began to make preparations to welcome him with all possible pomp and ceremony.
A great procession was made through the Prado, which is a street in Madrid famous for promenades,
processions, and public displays of all kinds. In moving through the city on this occasion,
the king and Prince Charles walked together, the monarch thus treating the prince as his equal.
There was a great canopy of state borne over their heads as they moved along. This canopy was
supported by a large number of persons of the highest rank. The streets, and the windows and
balconies of the houses on each side, were thronged with spectators, dressed in the gay and
splendid court dresses of those times. When they reached the end of the route, and were about
to enter the gate of the palace, there was a delay to decide which should enter first, the
king and the prince each insisting on giving the precedence to the other. At last it was settled
by their both going in together.

If the prince thus, on the one hand, derived some benefit in the gratification of his pride
by the Spanish etiquette and parade, he suffered some inconvenience and disappointment from
it, on the other hand, by its excluding him from all intercourse or acquaintance with the Infanta.
It was not proper for the young man to see or to speak to the young lady, in such a case as
this, until the arrangements had been more fully matured. The formalities of the engagement
must have proceeded beyond the point which they had yet reached, before the bridegroom could
be admitted to a personal interview with the bride. It is true, he could see her in public,
where she was in a crowd, with other ladies of the court, and where he could have no communication
with her; but this was all. They arranged it, however, to give Charles as many opportunities
of this kind as possible. There were shows, in which the prince could see the Infanta among
the spectators; and they arranged tiltings and ridings at the ring, and other athletic sports,
such as Charles excelled in, and let him perform his exploits in her presence. His rivals in
these contests did not have the incivility to conquer him, and his performances excited expressions,
at least, of universal admiration.

But the prince and Buckingham did not very willingly submit to the stiffness and formality
of the Spanish court. As soon as they came to feel a little at home, they began to act with
great freedom. At one time the prince learned that the Infanta was going, early in the morning,
to take a walk in some private pleasure grounds, at a country house in the neighborhood of
Madrid, and he conceived the design of gaining an interview with her there by stealth. He accordingly
repaired to the place, got admitted in some way within the precincts of the palace, and contrived
to clamber over a high wall which separated him from the grounds in which the Infanta was walking,
and so let himself down into her presence. The accounts do not state whether she herself was
pleased or alarmed, but the officer who had her in charge, an old nobleman, was very much alarmed,
and begged the prince to retire, as he himself would be subject to a very severe punishment
if it were known that he had allowed such an interview. Finally they opened the door, and the
prince went out. Many people were pleased with this and similar adventures of the prince and
of Buckingham, but the leading persons about the court were displeased with them. Their precise
and formal notions of propriety were very much shocked by such freedoms.

Besides, it was soon found that the characters of these high-born visitors, especially that
of Buckingham, were corrupt, and their lives very irregular. Buckingham was accustomed to treat
King James in a very bold, familiar, and imperious manner, and he fell insensibly into the
same habits of intercourse with those about him in Spain. The little reserve and caution which
he manifested at first soon wore off, and he began to be very generally disliked. In the mean
time the negotiation was, as Bristol had expected, very much put back by the prince's arrival.
The King of Spain formed new plans, and thought of new conditions to impose. The Catholics,
too, thought that Charles's coming thus into a Catholic country, indicated some leaning, on
his part, toward the Catholic faith. The pope actually wrote him a long letter, the object
of which was to draw him off from the ranks of Protestantism. Charles wrote a civil, but rather
an evasive reply.

In the mean time, King James wrote childish letters from time to time to his two dear boys,
as he called them, and he sent them a great many presents of jewelry and splendid dresses,
some for them to wear themselves, and some for the prince to offer as gifts to the Infanta.
Among these, he describes, in one of his letters, a little mirror, set in a case which was
to be worn hung at the girdle. He wrote to Charles that when he gave this mirror to the Infanta,
he must tell her that it was a picture which he had had imbued with magical virtue by means
of incantations and charms, so that whenever she looked into it, she would see a portrait of
the most beautiful princess in England, France, or Spain.

At last the great obstacle in the way of the conclusion of the treaty of marriage, which consisted
in the delays and difficulties in getting the pope's dispensation, was removed. The dispensation
came. But then the King of Spain wanted some new guarantees in respect to the privileges of
Catholics in England, under pretense of securing more perfectly the rights of the Infanta and
of her attendants when they should have arrived in that country. The truth was, he probably
wished to avail himself of the occasion to gain some foothold for the Catholic faith in England,
which country had become almost entirely Protestant. At length, however, all obstacles seemed
to be removed, and the treaty was signed. The news of it was received with great joy in England,
as it seemed to secure a permanent alliance between the two powerful countries of England and
Spain. Great celebrations took place in London, to do honor to the occasion. A chapel was built
for the Infanta, to be ready for her on her arrival; and a fleet was fitted out to convey her
and her attendants to her new home.

In the mean time, however, although the king had signed the treaty, there was a strong party
formed against the marriage in Spain. Buckingham was hated and despised. Charles, they saw,
was almost entirely under his influence. They said they would rather see the Infanta in her
grave than in the hands of such men. Buckingham became irritated by the hostility he had awakened,
and he determined to break off the match entirely. He wrote home to James that he did not believe
the Spanish court had any intention of carrying the arrangement really into effect; that they
were procrastinating the affair on every possible pretext, and that he was really afraid that,
if the prince were to attempt to leave the country, they would interpose and detain him as
a prisoner. King James was very much alarmed. He wrote in the greatest trepidation, urging
"the lads" to come away immediately, leaving a proxy behind them, if necessary, for the solemnization
of the marriage. This was what Buckingham wanted, and he and the prince began to make preparations
for their departure.

The King of Spain, far from interposing any obstacles in the way, only treated them with greater
and higher marks of respect as the time of their separation from his court drew nigh. He arranged
great and pompous ceremonies to honor their departure. He accompanied them, with all the grandees
of the court, as far as to the Escurial, which is a famous royal palace not far from Madrid,
built and furnished in the most sumptuous style of magnificence and splendor. Here they had
parting feasts and celebrations. Here the prince took his leave of the Infanta, Bristol serving
as interpreter, to translate his parting speeches into Spanish, so that she could understand
them. From the Escurial the prince and Buckingham, with a great many English noblemen who had
followed them to Madrid, and a great train of attendants, traveled toward the seacoast, where
a fleet of vessels were ready to receive them.

They embarked at a port called St. Andrew. They came very near being lost in a storm of mist
and rain which came upon them while going out to the ships, which were at a distance from the
shore, in small boats provided to convey them. Having escaped this danger, they arrived safely
at Portsmouth, the great landing point of the British navy on the southern shores of England,
and thence proceeded to London. They sent back orders that the proxy should not be used, and
the match was finally abandoned, each party accusing the other of duplicity and bad faith.
King James was however, very glad to get his son safe back again, and the people made as many
bonfires and illuminations to celebrate the breaking up of this Catholic match, as they had
done before to do honor to its supposed completion. As all hope of recovering the Palatinate
by negotiation was now past, the king began to prepare for the attempt to conquer it by force
of arms.

King James made slow progress in his military preparations. He could not raise the funds without
the action of Parliament, and the houses were not in very good humor. The expenses of the prince's
visit to Spain had been enormous, and other charges, arising out of the pomp and splendor with
which the arrangements of the court were maintained, gave them a strong feeling of discontent.
They had other grievances of which they were disposed to complain, and they began to look upon
this war, notwithstanding its Protestant character, as one in which the king was only striving
to recover his son-in-law's dominions, and, consequently, as one which pertained more to his
personal interests than to the public welfare of the realm.

While things were in this state the king fell sick. The mother of the Duke of Buckingham undertook
to prescribe for him. It was understood that Buckingham himself, who had, in the course of
the Spanish enterprise, and since his return, acquired an entire ascendency over Charles, was
not unwilling that his old master should leave the stage, and the younger one reign in his
stead; and that his mother shared in this feeling. At any rate, her prescriptions made the
king much worse. He had the sacrament administered to him in his sick chamber, and said that
he derived great comfort from it. One morning, very early, he sent for the prince to come and
see him. Charles rose, dressed himself, and came. His father had something to say to him, and
tried to speak. He could not. His strength was too far gone. He fell back upon his pillow,
and died.

Charles was, of course, now king. The theory in the English monarchy is, that the king never
dies. So soon as the person in whom the royal sovereignty resides ceases to breathe, the principle
of supremacy vests immediately in his successor, by a law of transmission entirely independent
of the will of man. The son becomes king by a divine right. His being proclaimed and crowned,
as he usually is, at some convenient time early in his reign, are not ceremonies which make
him king. They only acknowledge him to be so. He does not, in any sense, derive his powers
and prerogatives from these acts. He only receives from his people, by means of them, a recognition
of his right to the high office to which he has already been inducted by the fiat of Heaven.

It will be observed, thus, that the ideas which prevailed in respect to the nature and province
of government, were very different in England at that time, from those which are entertained
in America at the present day. With us, the administration of government is merely a business,
transacted for the benefit of the people by their agents--men who are put in power for this
purpose, and who, like other agents, are responsible to their principals for the manner in
which they fulfill their trusts. But government in England was, in the days of the Stuarts--and
it is so to a great extent at the present day--a right which one family possessed, and which
entitled that family to certain immunities, powers, and prerogatives, which they held entirely
independent of any desire, on the part of the people, that they should exercise them, or even
their consent that they should do so. The right to govern the realm of Great Britain was a
sort of estate which descended to Charles from his ancestors, and with the possession and enjoyment
of which the community had no right to interfere.

This seems, at first view, very absurd to us, but it is not particularly absurd. Charles's
lawyers would say to any plain proprietor of a piece of land, who might call in question his
right to govern the country, The king holds his crown by precisely the same tenure that you
hold your farm. Why should you be the exclusive possessor of that land, while so many poor
beggars are starving? Because it has descended to you from your ancestors, and nothing has
descended to them. And it is precisely so that the right to manage the fleets and armies, and
to administer the laws of the realm, has descended, under the name of sovereignty, to him,
and no such political power has descended to you.

True, the farmer would reply; but in matters of government we are to consider what will promote
the general good. The great object to be attained is the welfare and happiness of the community.
Now, if this general welfare comes into competition with the supposed rights of individuals,
arising from such a principle as hereditary succession, the latter ought certainly to yield.

But why, might the lawyer reply, should rights founded on hereditary succession yield any more
readily in the case of government than in the case of property? The distribution of property
influences the general welfare quite as much as the management of power. Suppose it were proved
that the general welfare of your parish would be promoted by the division of your land among
the destitute there. You have nothing to oppose to such a proposition but your hereditary right.
And the king has that to oppose to any plan of a division of his prerogatives and powers among
the people who would like to share them.

Whatever may be thought of this reasoning on this side of the Atlantic, and at the present
day, it was considered very satisfactory in England two or three centuries ago. The true and
proper jurisdiction of an English monarch, as it had existed from ancient times, was considered
as an absolute right, vesting in each successive inheritor of the crown, and which the community
could not justly interfere with or disturb for any reasons less imperious than such as would
authorize an interference with the right of succession to private property. Indeed, it is probable
that, with most men at that time, an inherited right to govern was regarded as the most sacred
of the two.

The fact seems to be, that the right of a son to come into the place of his father, whether
in respect to property, power, or social rank, is not a natural, inherent, and indefeasible
right, but a privilege which society accords, as a matter of convenience and expediency. In
England, expediency is, on the whole, considered to require that all three of these things,
viz., property, rank, and power, in certain cases, should descend from father to son. In this
country, on the other hand, we confine the hereditament to property, abrogating it in the case
of rank and power. In neither case is there probably any absolute natural right, but a conventional
right is allowed to take its place in one, or another, or all of these particulars, according
to the opinion of the community in respect to what its true interests and the general welfare,
on the whole, require.

The kings themselves of this Stuart race--which race includes Mary Queen of Scots, the mother
of the line, and James I., Charles I., Charles II., and James II.--entertained very high ideas
of these hereditary rights of theirs to govern the realm of England. They felt a determination
to maintain these rights and powers at all hazards. Charles ascended the throne with these
feelings, and the chief point of interest in the history of his reign is the contest in which
he engaged with the English people in his attempts to maintain them.

The body with which the king came most immediately into conflict in this long struggle for
ascendency, was the Parliament. And here American readers are very liable to fall into a mistake
by considering the houses of Parliament as analogous to the houses of legislation in the various
governments of this country. In our governments the chief magistrate has only to execute definite
and written laws and ordinances, passed by the Legislature, and which the Legislature may pass
with or without his consent; and when enacted, he must be governed by them. Thus the president
or the governor is, in a certain sense, the agent and officer of the legislative power of the
state, to carry into effect its decisions, and this legislative power has really the control.

By the ancient Constitution of England, however, the Parliament was merely a body of counselors,
as it were, summoned by the king to give him their advice, to frame for him such laws as he
wished to have framed, and to aid him in raising funds by taxing the people. The king might
call this council or not, as he pleased. There was no necessity for calling it unless he needed
more funds than he could raise by his own resources. When called, they felt that they had come,
in a great measure, to aid the king in doing his will. When they framed a law, they sent it
to him, and if he was satisfied with it, he made it law. It was the king who really enacted
it. If he did not approve the law, he wrote upon the parchment which contained it, "The king
will think of it," and that was the end. The king would call upon them to assess a tax and
collect the money, and would talk to them about his plans, and his government, and the aid
which he desired from them to enable him to accomplish what he had himself undertaken. In fact,
the king was the government, and the houses of Parliament his instruments to aid him in giving
effect to his decrees.

The nobles, that is, the heads of the great families, and also the bishops, who were the heads
of the various dioceses of the Church formed one branch of this great council. This was called
the House of Lords. Certain representatives of the counties and of the towns formed another
branch, called the House of Commons. These delegates came to the council, not from any right
which the counties and towns were supposed to possess to a share in the government, but simply
because they were summoned by the king to come and give him their aid. They were to serve without
pay, as a matter of duty which they owed to the sovereign. Those that came from counties were
called knights, and those from the towns burgesses. These last were held in very little estimation.
The towns, in those days, were considered as mere collections of shopkeepers and tradesmen,
who were looked down upon with much disdain by the haughty nobles. When the king called his
Parliament together, and went in to address them, he entered the chamber of the House of Peers,
and the commons were called in, to stand where they could, with their heads uncovered, to hear
what he had to say. They were, in a thousand other ways, treated as an inferior class; but
still their counsels might, in some cases, be of service, and so they were summoned to attend,
though they were to meet always, and deliberate, in a separate chamber.

As the king could call the Parliament together at any time and place he pleased, so he could
suspend or terminate their sittings at any time. He could intermit the action of a Parliament
for a time, sending the members to their homes until he should summon them again. This was
called a prorogation. Or he could dissolve the body entirely at any time, and then require
new elections for a new Parliament whenever he wished to avail himself of the wisdom or aid
of such a body again.

Thus every thing went on the supposition that the real responsibility for the government was
with the king. He was the monarch, and the real sovereignty vested in him. He called his nobles,
and a delegation from the mass of the people, together, whenever he wanted their help, and
not otherwise. He was responsible, not to them nor to the people at large, but to God only,
for the acts of his administration. The duty of Parliament was limited to that of aiding him
in carrying out his plans of government, and the people had nothing to do but to be obedient,
submissive, and loyal. These were, at any rate, the ideas of the kings, and all the forms of
the English Constitution and the ancient phraseology in which the transactions are expressed,
correspond with them.

We can not give a better proof and illustration of what has been said than by transcribing
the substance of one of King James's messages to his Parliament, delivered about the close
of his life, and, of course, at the period of which we are writing. It was as follows:

     "My Lords spiritual and temporal, and you the Commons: In my last
     Parliament I made long discourses, especially to them of the
     Lower House. I did open the true thought of my heart. But I may
     say with our Savior, 'I have piped to you and ye have not danced;
     I have mourned to you and you have not lamented;' so all my
     sayings turned to me again without any success. And now, to tell
     the reasons of your calling and of this meeting, apply it to
     yourselves, and spend not the time in long speeches. Consider
     that the Parliament is a thing composed of a head and a body; the
     monarch and the two estates. It was, first, a monarchy; then,
     after, a Parliament. There are no Parliaments but in monarchical
     governments; for in Venice, the Netherlands, and other free
     governments there are none. The head is to call the body
     together; and for the clergy the bishops are chief, for shires
     their knights, for towns and cities their burgesses and citizens.
     These are to treat of difficult matters, and counsel their king
     with their best advice to make laws[A] for the commonweal and the
     Lower House is also to petition the king and acquaint him with
     their grievances, and not to meddle with the king's prerogative.
     They are to offer supply for his necessity, and he to distribute,
     in recompense thereof, justice and mercy. As in all Parliaments
     it is the king's office to make good laws, whose fundamental
     cause is the people's ill manners, so at this time.

[Footnote A: Meaning advice to him how he shall make laws, as is evident from what is said below.]

     "For a supply to my necessities, I have reigned eighteen years,
     in which I have had peace, and I have received far less supply
     than hath been given to any king since the Conquest. The last
     queen had, one year with another, above a hundred thousand pounds
     per annum in subsidies; and in all my time I have had but four
     subsidies and six fifteens[B]. It is ten years since I had a
     subsidy, in all which time I have been sparing to trouble you. I
     have turned myself as nearly to save expenses as I may. I have
     abated much in my household expenses, in my navies, and the
     charge of my munition."

[Footnote B: Species of taxes granted by Parliament.]

After speaking about the affairs of the Palatinate, and calling upon the Parliament to furnish
him with money to recover it for his son-in-law, he adds:

     "Consider the trade for the making thereof better, and show me
     the reason why my mint, these eight or nine years, hath not gone.
     I confess I have been liberal in my grants; but if I be informed,
     I will amend all hurtful grievances. But whoever shall hasten
     after grievances, and desire to make himself popular he hath the
     spirit of Satan. I was, in my first Parliament, a novice; and in
     my last, there was a kind of beasts, called undertakers, a
     dozen of whom undertook to govern the last Parliament, and they
     led me. I shall thank you for your good office, and desire that
     the world may say well of our agreement."

This kind of harangue from the king to his Parliament seems not to have been considered at
the time, at all extraordinary; though, if such a message were to be sent, at the present day,
to a body of legislators, whether by a king or a president, it would certainly produce a sensation.

Still, notwithstanding what we have said, the Parliament did contrive gradually to attain to
the possession of some privileges and powers of its own. The English people have a great deal
of independence and spirit, though Americans traveling there, with ideas carried from this
country, are generally surprised at finding so little instead of so much. The knights and burgesses
of the House of Commons, though they submitted patiently to the forms of degradation which
the lords and kings imposed upon them, gradually got possession of certain powers which they
claimed as their own, and which they showed a strong disposition to defend. They claimed the
exclusive right to lay taxes of every kind. This had been the usage so long, that they had
the same right to it that the king had to his crown. They had a right too, to petition the
king for a redress of any grievances which they supposed the people were suffering under his
reign. These, and certain other powers and immunities which they had possessed, were called
their privileges. The king's rights were, on the other hand, called his prerogatives. The Parliament
were always endeavoring to extend, define, and establish their privileges. The king was equally
bent on maintaining his ancient prerogatives. King Charles's reign derives its chief interest
from the long and insane contest which he waged with his Parliament on this question. The contest
commenced at the king's accession to the throne, and lasted a quarter of a century: it ended
with his losing all his prerogatives and his head.

This circumstance, that the main interest in King Charles's reign is derived from his contest
with his Parliament, has made it necessary to explain somewhat fully, as we have done, the
nature of that body. We have described it as it was in the days of the Stuarts; but, in order
not to leave any wrong impression on the mind of the reader in regard to its present condition,
we must add, that though all its external forms remain the same, the powers and functions of
the body have greatly changed. The despised and contemned knights and burgesses, that were
not worthy to have seats provided for them when the king was delivering them his speech, now
rule the world; or, at least, come nearer to the possession of that dominion than any other
power has ever done, in ancient or modern times. They decide who shall administer the government,
and in what way. They make the laws, settle questions of trade and commerce, decide really
on peace and war, and, in a word, hold the whole control, while the nominal sovereign takes
rides in the royal parks, or holds drawing-rooms in the palaces, in empty and powerless parade.
There is no question that the British House of Commons has exerted a far wider influence on
the destinies of the human race than any other governmental power that has ever existed. It
has gone steadily on for five, and perhaps for ten centuries, in the same direction and toward
the same ends; and whatever revolutions may threaten other elements of European power, the
British House of Commons, in some form or other, is as sure as any thing human can be of existence
and power for five or ten centuries to come.

And yet it is one of the most remarkable of the strange phenomena of social life, that this
body, standing at the head, as it really does, of all human power, submits patiently still
to all the marks and tokens of inferiority and degradation which accompanied its origin. It
comes together when the sovereign sends writs, ordering the several constituencies to choose
their representatives, and the representatives to assemble. It comes humbly into the House
of Peers to listen to the instructions of the sovereign at the opening of the session, the
members in a standing position, and with heads uncovered.[C] It debates these suggestions with
forms and in a phraseology which imply that it is only considering what counsel to give the
king. It enacts nothing--it only recommends; and it holds its existence solely at the discretion
of the great imaginary power which called it into being. These forms may, very probably, soon
be changed for others more true to the facts; and the principle of election may be changed,
so as to make the body represent more fully the general population of the empire; but the body
itself will doubtless continue its action for a very long period to come.

[Footnote C: Even in the case of a committee of conference between the two houses, the lords
have seats in the committee-room and wear their hats. The members from the commons must stand,
and be uncovered during the deliberations!]

According to the view of the subject which we have presented, it would of course follow, as
the real sovereignty was mainly in the king's hands, that at the death of one monarch and the
accession of another, the functions of all officers holding their places under the authority
of the former would cease. This was actually the case. And it shows how entirely the Parliament
was considered as the instrument and creation of the king, that on the death of a king, the
Parliament immediately expired. The new monarch must make a new Parliament, if he wished one,
to help him carry out his own plans. In the same manner almost all other offices expired. As
it would be extremely inconvenient or impossible to appoint anew all the officers of such a
realm on a sudden emergency, it is usual for the king to issue a decree renewing the appointments
of the existing incumbents of these offices. Thus King Charles, two days after his father's
death, made it his first act to renew the appointments of the members of his father's privy
council, of the foreign embassadors, and of the judges of the courts, in order that the affairs
of the empire might go on without interruption. He also issued summonses for calling a Parliament,
and then made arrangements for the solemnization of his father's funeral.

The scene of these transactions was what was, in those days, called Westminster. Minster means
cathedral. A cathedral church had been built, and an abbey founded, at a short distance west
from London, near the mouth of the Thames. The church was called the West minster, and the
abbey, Westminster Abbey. The town afterward took the same name. The street leading to the
city of London from Westminster was called the Strand; it lay along the shore of the river.
The gate by which the city of London was entered on this side was called Temple Bar, on account
of a building just within the walls, at that point, which was called the Temple. In process
of time, London expanded beyond its bounds and spread westward. The Strand became a magnificent
street of shops and stores. Westminster was filled with palaces and houses of the nobility,
the whole region being entirely covered with streets and edifices of the greatest magnificence
and splendor. Westminster is now called the West End of London, though the jurisdiction of
the city still ends at Temple Bar.

Parliament held its sessions in a building near the shore, called St. Stephen's. The king's
palace, called St. James's Palace, was near. The old church became a place of sepulture for
the English kings, where a long line of them now repose. The palace of King James's wife, Anne
of Denmark, was on the bank of the river, some distance down the Strand. She called it, during
her life, Denmark House, in honor of her native land. Its name is now Somerset House.

King James's funeral was attended with great pomp. The body was conveyed from Somerset House
to its place of repose in the Abbey, and attended by a great procession. King Charles walked
as chief mourner. Two earls attended him, one on each side, and the train of his robes was
borne by twelve peers of the realm. The expenses of this funeral amounted to a sum equal to
two hundred thousand dollars.

One thing more is to be stated before we can consider Charles as fairly entered upon his career,
and that is the circumstance of his marriage. His father James, so soon as he found the negotiations
with Spain must be finally abandoned, opened a new negotiation with the King of France for
his daughter Henrietta Maria. After some delay, this arrangement was concluded upon. The treaty
of marriage was made, and soon after the old king's death, Charles began to think of bringing
home his bride.

He accordingly made out a commission for a nobleman, appointed for the purpose, to act in his
name, in the performance of the ceremony at Paris. The pope's dispensation was obtained, Henrietta
Maria, as well as the Infanta, being a Catholic. The ceremony was performed, as such ceremonies
usually were in Paris, in the famous church of Notre Dame, where Charles's grandmother, Mary
Queen of Scots, had been married to a prince of France about seventy years before.

There was a great theater, or platform, erected in front of the altar in the church, which
was thronged by the concourse of spectators who rushed to witness the ceremony. The beautiful
princess was married by proxy to a man in another kingdom, whom she had never seen, or, at
least, never known. It is not probable that she observed him at the time when he was, for one
evening, in her presence, on his journey through Paris. The Duke of Buckingham had been sent
over by Charles to conduct home his bride. Ships were waiting at Boulogne, a port nearly opposite
to Dover, to take her and her attendants on board. She bade farewell to the palaces of Paris,
and set out on her journey.[D]

[Footnote D: See portrait at the commencement of this volume.]

The king, in the mean time, had gone to Dover, where he awaited her arrival. She landed at
Dover on the day after sailing from Boulogne, sea-sick and sad. The king received his bride,
and with their attendants they went by carriages to Canterbury, and on the following day they
entered London. Great preparations had been made for receiving the king and his consort in
a suitable manner; but London was, at this time, in a state of great distress and fear on account
of the plague which had broken out there. The disease had increased during the king's absence,
and the alarm and anxiety were so great, that the rejoicings on account of the arrival of the
queen were omitted. She journeyed quietly, therefore, to Westminster, and took up her abode
at Somerset House, which had been the residence of her predecessor. They had fitted it up for
her reception, providing for it, among other conveniences, a Roman Catholic chapel, where she
could enjoy the services of religion in the forms to which she had been accustomed.

Charles commenced his reign in 1625. He continued to reign about twenty-four years. It will
assist the reader to receive and retain in mind a clear idea of the course of events during
his reign, if we regard it as divided into three periods. During the first, which continued
about four years, Charles and the Parliament were both upon the stage, contending with each
other, but just at open war. Each party intrigued, and maneuvered, and struggled to gain its
own ends, the disagreement widening and deepening continually, till it ended in an open rupture,
when Charles abandoned the plan of having Parliaments at all, and attempted to govern alone.
This attempt to manage the empire without a legislature lasted for ten years, and is the second
period. After this a Parliament was called, and it soon made itself independent of the king,
and became hostile to him, the two powers being at open war. This constitutes the third period.
Thus we have four years spent in getting into the quarrel between the king and Parliament,
ten years in an attempt by the king to govern alone, and, finally, ten years of war, more or
less open, the king on one side, and the Parliament on the other.

The first four years--that is, the time spent in getting really into the quarrel with Parliament,
was Buckingham's work, for during that time Buckingham's influence with the king was paramount
and supreme; and whatever was done that was important or extraordinary, though done in the
king's name, really originated in him. The whole country knew this and were indignant that
such a man, so unprincipled, so low in character, so reckless, and so completely under the
sway of his impulses and passions, should have such an influence over the king, and, through
him, such power to interfere with and endanger the mighty interests of so vast a realm.

It must not be supposed, however, in consequence of what has been said about the extent of
the regal power in England, that the daily care and responsibility of the affairs of government,
in its ordinary administration, rested directly upon the king. It is not possible that any
one mind can even comprehend, far less direct, such an enormous complication of interests and
of action as is involved in the carrying on, from day to day, the government of an empire.
Offices, authorities, and departments of administration spring up gradually, and all the ordinary
routine of the affairs of the empire are managed by them. Thus the navy was all completely
organized, with its gradations of rank, its rules of action, its records, its account books,
its offices and arrangements for provisionment and supply, the whole forming a vast system
which moved on of itself, whether the king were present or absent, sick or well, living or
dead. It was so with the army; it was so with the courts; it was so with the general administration
of the government, at London. The immense mass of business which constituted the work of government
was all systematized and arranged, and it moved on regularly, in the hands of more or less
prudent and careful men, who governed, themselves, by ancient rules and usages, and in most
cases managed wisely.

Every thing, however, was done in the king's name. The ships were his majesty's ships, the
admirals were his majesty's servants, the war was his majesty's war, the court was the King's
Bench. The idea was, that all these thousands of officers, of all ranks and grades, were only
an enormous multiplication of his majesty; that they were to do his will and carry on his administration
as he would himself carry it on were he personally capable of attending to such a vast detail;
subject, of course, to certain limits and restrictions which the laws and customs of the realm,
and the promises and contracts of his predecessors, had imposed. But although all this action
was theoretically the king's action, it came to be, in fact, almost wholly independent of him.
It went on of itself, in a regular and systematic way, pursuing its own accustomed course,
except so far as the king directly interposed to modify its action.

It might be supposed that the king would certainly take the general direction of affairs into
his own hands, and that this charge, at least, would necessarily come upon him, as king, day
by day. Some monarchs have attempted to do this, but it is obvious that there must be some
provision for having this general charge, as well as all the subordinate functions of government,
attended to independently of the king, as his being always in a condition to fulfill this duty
is not to be relied upon. Sometimes the king is young and inexperienced; sometimes he is sick
or absent; and sometimes he is too feeble in mind, or too indolent, or too devoted to his pleasures,
to exercise any governmental care. There has gradually grown up, therefore, in all monarchies,
the custom of having a central board of officers of state, whom the king appoints, and who
take the general direction of affairs in his stead, except so far as he chooses to interfere.
This board, in England, is called the Privy Council.

The Privy Council in England is a body of great importance. Its nature and its functions are,
of course, entirely different from those of the two houses of Parliament. They represent, or
are intended to represent, the nation. The Parliament is, in theory, the nation, assembled
at the king's command, to give him their advice. The Privy Council, on the other hand, represents
the king. It is the king's Privy Council. They act in his name. They follow his directions
when he chooses to give any. Whatever they decide upon and decree, the king signs--often, indeed,
without any idea of its nature. Still he signs it, and all such decrees go forth to the word
as the king's orders in council. The Privy Council, of course, would have its meetings, its
officers, its records, its rules of proceeding, and its various usages, and these grew, in
time, to be laws and rights; but still it was, in theory, only a sort of expansion of the king,
as if to make a kind of artificial being, with one soul, but many heads and hands, because
no natural human being could possibly have capacities and powers extensive and multifarious
enough for the exigencies of reigning. Charles thus had a council who took charge of every
thing, except so far as he chose to interpose. The members were generally able and experienced
men. And yet Buckingham was among them. He had been made Lord High Admiral of England, which
gave him supreme command of the navy, and admitted him to the Privy Council. These were very
high honors.

This Privy Council now took the direction of public affairs, attended to every thing, provided
for all emergencies, and kept all the complicated machinery of government in motion, without
the necessity of the king's having any personal agency in the matter. The king might interpose,
more or less, as he was inclined; and when he did interpose, he sometimes found obstacles in
the way of immediately accomplishing his plans, in the forms or usages which had gradually
grown into laws.

For instance, when the king began his reign, he was very eager to have the war for the recovery
of the Palatinate go on at once; and he was, besides, very much embarrassed for want of money.
He wished, therefore, in order to save time, that the old Parliament which King James had called
should continue to act under his reign. But his Privy Council told him that that could not
be. That was James's Parliament. If he wanted one for his reign, he must call upon the people
to elect a new Parliament for him.

The new Parliament was called, and Charles sent them a very civil message, explaining the emergency
which had induced him to call them, and the reason why he was so much in want of money. His
father had left the government a great deal in debt. There had been heavy expenses connected
with the death of the former king, and with his own accession and marriage. Then there was
the war. It had been engaged in by his father, with the approbation of the former Parliament;
and engagements had been made with allies, which now they could not honorably retract. He urged
them, therefore, to grant, without delay, the necessary supplies.

The Parliament met in July, but the plague was increasing in London, and they had to adjourn,
early in August, to Oxford. This city is situated upon the Thames, and was then, as it is now,
the seat of a great many colleges. These colleges were independent of each other in their internal
management, though united together in one general system. The name of one of them, which is
still very distinguished, was Christ Church College. They had, among the buildings of that
college, a magnificent hall, more than one hundred feet long, and very lofty, built in a very
imposing style. It is still a great object of interest to all who visit Oxford. This hall was
fitted up for the use of Parliament, and the king met the two houses there. He made a new speech
himself, and others were made by his ministers, explaining the state of public affairs, and
gently urging the houses to act with promptness and decision.

The houses then separated, and each commenced its own deliberations. But, instead of promptly
complying with the king's proposals they sent him a petition for redress of a long list of
what they called grievances. These grievances were, almost all of them, complaints of the toleration
and encouragement of the Catholics, through the influence of the king's Catholic bride. She
had stipulated to have a Catholic chapel, and Catholic attendants, and, after her arrival in
England, she and Buckingham had so much influence over the king, that they were producing quite
a change at court, and gradually through all ranks of society, in favor of the Catholics. The
Commons complained of a great many things, nearly all, however, originating in this cause.
The king answered these complaints, clause by clause, promising redress more or less distinctly.
There is not room to give this petition and the answers in full, but as all the subsequent
troubles between Charles and the people of England arose out of this difficulty of his young
wife's bringing in so strong a Catholic influence with her to the realm, it may be well to
give an abstract of some of the principal petitions, with the king's answers.

The Commons said:

    That they had understood that popish priests, and other Catholics,
    were gradually creeping in as teachers of the youth of the realm,
    in the various seminaries of learning, and they wished to have
    decided measures taken to examine all candidates for such
    stations, with a view to the careful exclusion of all who were not
    true Protestants.

    King.--Allowed. And I will send to the archbishops and all the
    authorities to see that this is done.

    Commons.--That more efficient arrangements should be made for
    appointing able and faithful men in the Church--men that will
    really devote themselves to preaching the Gospel to the people;
    instead of conferring these places and salaries on favorites,
    sometimes, as has been the case, several to the same man.

The king made some explanations in regard to this subject, and promised hereafter to comply
with this requisition.

    Commons.--That the laws against sending children out of the
    country to foreign countries to be educated in Catholic seminaries
    should be strictly enforced, and the practice be entirely broken
    up.

    King.--Agreed; and he would send to the lord admiral, and to all
    the naval officers on the coast, to watch very carefully and stop
    all children attempting to go abroad for such a purpose; and he
    would issue a proclamation commanding all the noblemen's children
    now on the Continent to return by a given day.

    Commons.--That no Catholic (or, as they called him, popish
    recusant, that is, a person refusing to subscribe to the
    Protestant faith, recusant meaning person refusing) be admitted
    into the king's service at court; and that no English Catholic
    be admitted into the queen's service. They could not refuse to
    allow her to employ her own French attendants, but to appoint
    English Catholics to the honorable and lucrative offices at her
    disposal was doing a great injury to the Protestant cause in the
    realm.

The king agreed to this, with some conditions and evasions.

    Commons.--That all Jesuits and Catholic priests, owing
    allegiance to the See of Rome, should be sent away from the
    country, according to laws already existing, after fair notice
    given; and if they would not go, that they should be imprisoned in
    such a manner as to be kept from all communication with other
    persons, so as not to disseminate their false religion.

    King.--The laws on this subject shall be enforced.

The above are sufficient for a specimen of these complaints and of the king's answers. There
were many more of them, but they have all the same character--being designed to stop the strong
current of Catholic influence and ascendency which was setting in to the court, and through
the court into the realm, through the influence of the young queen and the persons connected
with her. At the present day, and in this country, the Commons will be thought to be in the
wrong, inasmuch as the thing which they were contending against was, in the main, merely the
toleration of the Catholic religion. But then the king was in the wrong too, for, since the
laws against this toleration stood enacted by the consent and concurrence of his predecessors,
he should not have allowed them to be infracted and virtually annulled through the influence
of a foreign bride and an unworthy favorite.

Perhaps he felt that he was wrong, or perhaps his answers were all framed for him by his Privy
Council. At all events, they were entirely favorable to the demands of the Commons. He promised
every thing. In many things he went even beyond their demands. It is admitted, however, on
all hands, that, so far as he himself had any agency in making these replies, he was not really
sincere. He himself, and Buckingham, were very eager to get supplies. Buckingham was admiral
of the fleet, and very strongly desired to enlarge the force at his command, with a view to
the performing of some great exploit in the war. It is understood, therefore, that the king
intended his replies as promises merely. At any rate, the promises were made. The Commons were
called into the great hall again, at Christ Church, where the Peers assembled, and the king's
answers were read to them. Buckingham joined in this policy of attempting to conciliate the
Commons. He went into their assembly and made a long speech, explaining and justifying his
conduct, and apologizing, in some sense, for what might seem to be wrong.

The Commons returned to their place of deliberation, but they were not satisfied. They wanted
something besides promises. Some were in favor of granting supplies "in gratitude to his majesty
for his gracious answer." Others thought differently. They did not see the necessity for raising
money for this foreign war. They had greater enemies at home (meaning Buckingham and popery)
than they had abroad. Besides, if the king would stop his waste and extravagance in bestowing
honors and rewards, there would be money enough for all necessary uses. In a word, there was
much debate, but nothing done. The king, after a short time, sent a message to them urging
them to come to a decision. They sent him back a declaration which showed that they did not
intend to yield. Their language, however, was of the most humble character. They called him
"their dread sovereign," and themselves "his poor commons." The king was displeased with them,
and dissolved the Parliament. They, of course, immediately became private citizens, and dispersed
to their homes.

After trying some ineffectual attempts to raise money by his own royal prerogatives and powers,
the king called a new Parliament, taking some singular precautions to keep out of it such persons
as he thought would oppose his plans. The Earl of Bristol, whom Buckingham had been so jealous
of, considering him as his rival, was an influential member of the House of Peers. Charles
and Buckingham agreed to omit him in sending out the royal writs to summon the peers. He petitioned
Parliament, claiming a right to his seat. Charles then sent him his writ, but gave him a command,
as his sovereign, not to attend the session. He also selected four of the prominent men in
the House of Commons, men whom he considered most influential in opposition to him and to Buckingham,
and appointed them to offices which would call them away from London; and as it was the understanding
in those days that the sovereign had a right to command the services of his subjects, they
were obliged to go. The king hoped, by these and similar means, to diminish the influence against
him in Parliament, and to get a majority in his favor. But his plans did not succeed. Such
measures only irritated the House and the country. After another struggle this Parliament was
dissolved too.

Things went on so for four or five years, the breach between the king and the people growing
wider and wider. Within this time there were four Parliaments called, and, after various contentions
with them, they were, one after another, dissolved. The original subject of disagreement, viz.,
the growing influence of the Catholics, was not the only one. Other points came up, growing
out of the king's use of his prerogative, and his irregular and, as they thought, illegal attempts
to interfere with their freedom of action. The king, or, rather, Buckingham using the king's
name, resorted to all sorts of contrivances to accomplish this object. For instance, it had
long been the custom, in case any member of the House of Peers was absent, for him to give
authority to any friend of his, who was also a member, to vote for him. This authority was
called a proxy. This word is supposed to be derived from procuracy, which means action in the
place of, and in behalf of, another. Buckingham induced a great number of the peers to give
him their proxies. He did this by rewards, honors, and various other influences, and he found
so many willing to yield to these inducements, that at one time he had thirty or forty proxies
in his hands. Thus, on a question arising in the House of Lords, he could give a very large
majority of votes. The House, after murmuring for some time, and expressing much discontent
and vexation at this state of things, finally made a law that no member of the House should
ever have power to use more than two proxies.

One of the Parliaments which King Charles assembled at length brought articles of impeachment
against Buckingham, and a long contest arose on this subject. An impeachment is a trial of
a high officer of state for maladministration of his office. All sorts of charges were brought
against Buckingham, most of which were true. The king considered their interfering to call
one of his ministers to account as wholly intolerable. He sent them orders to dismiss that
subject from their deliberations, and to proceed immediately with their work of laying taxes
to raise money, or he would dissolve the Parliament as he had done before. He reminded them
that the Parliaments were entirely "in his power for their calling, sitting, and dissolution,
and as he found their fruits were for good or evil, so they were to continue, or not to be."
If they would mend their errors and do their duty, henceforward he would forgive the past;
otherwise they were to expect his irreconcilable hostility.

This language irritated instead of alarming them. The Commons persisted in their plan of impeachment.
The king arrested the men whom they appointed as managers of the impeachment, and imprisoned
them. The Commons remonstrated, and insisted that Buckingham should be dismissed from the king's
service. The king, instead of dismissing him, took measures to have him appointed, in addition
to all his other offices, Chancellor of the University of Cambridge, a very exalted station.
Parliament remonstrated. The king, in retaliation, dissolved the Parliament.

Thus things went on from bad to worse, and from worse to worse again; the chief cause of the
difficulties, in almost all cases, being traceable to Buckingham's reckless and arbitrary conduct.
He was continually doing something in the pursuit of his own ends, by the rash and heedless
exercise of the vast powers committed to him, to make extensive and irreparable mischief. At
one time he ordered a part of the fleet over to the coast of France, to enter the French service,
the sailors expecting that they were to be employed against the Spaniards. They found, however,
that, instead of going against the Spaniards, they were to be sent to Rochelle. Rochelle was
a town in France in possession of the Protestants, and the King of France wished to subdue
them. The sailors sent a remonstrance to their commander, begging not to be forced to fight
against their brother Protestants. This remonstrance was, in form, what is called a Round Robin.

In a Round Robin a circle is drawn, the petition or remonstrance is written within it, and
the names are written all around it, to prevent any one's having to take the responsibility
of being the first signer. When the commander of the fleet received the Round Robin, instead
of being offended, he inquired into the facts, and finding that the case was really as the
Round Robin represented it, he broke away from the French command and returned to England.
He said he would rather be hanged in England for disobeying orders than to fight against the
Protestants of France.

Buckingham might have known that such a spirit as this in Englishmen was not to be trifled
with. But he knew nothing, and thought of nothing, except that he wished to please and gratify
the French government. When the fleet, therefore, arrived in England, he peremptorily ordered
it back, and he resorted to all sorts of pretexts and misrepresentations of the facts to persuade
the officers and men that they were not to be employed against the Protestants. The fleet accordingly
went back, and when they arrived, they found that Buckingham had deceived them. They were ordered
to Rochelle. One of the ships broke away and returned to England. The officers and men deserted
from the other ships and got home. The whole armament was disorganized, and the English people,
who took sides with the sailors, were extremely exasperated against Buckingham for his blind
and blundering recklessness, and against the king for giving such a man the power to do his
mischief on such an extensive scale.

At another time the duke and the king contrived to fit out a fleet of eighty sail to make a
descent upon the coast of Spain. It caused them great trouble to get the funds for this expedition,
as they had to collect them, in a great measure, by various methods depending on the king's
prerogative, and not by authority of Parliament. Thus the whole country were dissatisfied and
discontented in respect to the fleet before it was ready to sail. Then, as if this was not
enough, Buckingham overlooked all the officers in the navy in selecting a commander, and put
an officer of the army in charge of it; a man whose whole experience had been acquired in wars
on the land. The country thought that Buckingham ought to have taken the command himself, as
lord high admiral; and if not, that he ought to have selected his commander from the ranks
of the service employed. Thus the fleet set off on the expedition, all on board burning with
indignation against the arbitrary and absurd management of the favorite. The result of the
expedition was also extremely disastrous. They had an excellent opportunity to attack a number
of ships, which would have made a very rich prize; but the soldier-commander either did not
know, or did not dare to do, his duty. He finally, however, effected a landing, and took a
castle, but the sailors found a great store of wine there, and went to drinking and carousing,
breaking through all discipline. The commander had to get them on board again immediately,
and come away. Then he conceived the plan of going to intercept what were called the Spanish
galleons, which were ships employed to bring home silver from the mines in America, which the
Spaniards then possessed. On further thoughts he concluded to give up this idea, on account
of the plague, which, as he said, broke out in his ships. So he came back to England with his
fleet disorganized, demoralized, and crippled, and covered with military disgrace. The people
of England charged all this to Buckingham. Still the king persisted in retaining him. It was
his prerogative to do so.

After a while Buckingham got into a personal quarrel with Richelieu, who was the leading manager
of the French government, and he resolved that England should make war upon France. To alter
the whole political position of such an empire as that of Great Britain, in respect to peace
and war, and to change such a nation as France from a friend to an enemy, would seem to be
quite an undertaking for a single man to attempt, and that, too, without having any reason
whatever to assign, except a personal quarrel with a minister about a love affair. But so it
was. Buckingham undertook it. It was the king's prerogative to make peace or war, and Buckingham
ruled the king.

He contrived various ways of fomenting ill will. One was, to alienate the mind of the king
from the queen. He represented to him that the queen's French servants were fast becoming very
disrespectful and insolent in their treatment of him, and finally persuaded him to send them
all home. So the king went one day to Somerset House, which was the queen's residence--for
it is often the custom in high life in Europe for the husband and wife to have separate establishments--and
requested her to summon her French servants into his presence, and when they were assembled,
he told them that he had concluded to send them all home to France. Some of them, he said,
had acted properly enough, but others had been rude and forward, and that he had decided it
best to send them all home. The French king, on hearing of this, seized a hundred and twenty
English ships lying in his harbors in retaliation of this act, which he said was a palpable
violation of the marriage contract, as it certainly was. Upon this the king declared war against
France. He did not ask Parliament to act in this case at all. There was no Parliament. Parliament
had been dissolved in a fit of displeasure. The whole affair was an exercise of the royal prerogative.
Nor did the king now call a Parliament to provide means for carrying on the war, but set his
Privy Council to devise modes of doing it, through this same prerogative.

The attempts to raise money in these ways made great trouble. The people resisted, and interposed
all possible difficulties. However some funds were raised, and a fleet of a hundred sail, and
an army of seven thousand men, were got together. Buckingham undertook the command of this
expedition himself, as there had been so much dissatisfaction with his appointment of a commander
to the other. It resulted just as was to be expected in the case of seven thousand men, and
a hundred ships, afloat on the swelling surges of the English Channel, under the command of
vanity, recklessness, and folly. The duke came back to England in three months, bringing home
one third of his force. The rest had been lost, without accomplishing any thing. The measure
of public indignation against Buckingham was now full.

Buckingham himself walked as loftily and proudly as ever. He equipped another fleet, and was
preparing to set sail in it himself, as commander again. He went to Portsmouth, accordingly,
for this purpose, Portsmouth being the great naval station then, as now, on the southern coast
of England. Here a man named Felton, who had been an officer under the duke in the former expedition,
and who had been extremely exasperated against him on account of some of his management there,
and who had since found how universal was the detestation of him in England, resolved to rid
the country of such a curse at once. He accordingly took his station in the passage-way of
the house where Buckingham was, armed with a knife. Buckingham came out, talking with some
Frenchmen in an angry manner, having had some dispute with them, when Felton thrust the knife
into his side as he passed, and, leaving it in the wound, walked away, no one having noticed
who did the deed. Buckingham pulled out the knife, fell down, and died. The bystanders were
going to seize one of the Frenchmen, when Felton advanced and said, "I am the man; you are
to arrest me; let no one suffer that is innocent." He was taken. They found a paper in his
hat, saying that he was going to destroy the duke, and that he could not sacrifice his life
in a nobler cause than by delivering his country from so great an enemy.

King Charles was four miles off at this time. They carried him the news. He did not appear
at all concerned or troubled, but only directed that the murderer--he ought to have said, perhaps,
the executioner--should be secured, and that the fleet should proceed to sail. He also ordered
the treasurer to make arrangements for a splendid funeral.

The treasurer said, in reply, that a funeral would only be a temporary show, and that he could
hereafter erect a monument at half the cost, which would be a much more lasting memorial. Charles
acceded. Afterward, when Charles spoke to him about the monument, the treasurer replied, What
would the world say if your majesty were to build a monument to the Duke before you erect one
for your father? So the plan was abandoned, and Buckingham had no other monument than the universal
detestation of his countrymen.

The great difficulty in governing without a Parliament was the raising of funds. By the old
customs and laws of the realm, a tax upon the people could only be levied by the action of
the House of Commons; and the great object of the king and council during Buckingham's life,
in summoning Parliaments from time to time, was to get their aid in this respect. But as Charles
found that one Parliament after another withheld the grants, and spent their time in complaining
of his government, he would dissolve them, successively, after exhausting all possible means
of bringing them to a compliance with his will. He would then be thrown upon his own resources.

The king had some resources of his own. These were certain estates, and lands, and other property,
in various parts of the country, which belonged to the crown, the income of which the king
could appropriate. But the amount which could be derived from this source was very small. Then
there were certain other modes of raising money, which had been resorted to by former monarchs,
in emergencies, at distant intervals, but still in instances so numerous that the king considered
precedents enough had been established to make the power to resort to these modes a part of
the prerogative of the crown. The people, however, considered these acts of former monarchs
as irregularities or usurpations. They denied the king's right to resort to these methods,
and they threw so many difficulties in the way of the execution of his plans, that finally
he would call another Parliament, and make new efforts to lead them to conform to his will.
The more the experiment was tried, however, the worse it succeeded; and at last the king determined
to give up the idea of Parliaments altogether, and to compel the people to submit to his plans
of raising money without them.

The final dissolution of Parliament, by which Charles entered upon his new plan of government,
was attended with some resistance, and the affair made great difficulty. It seems that one
of the members, a certain Mr. Rolls, had had some of his goods seized for payment of some of
the king's irregular taxes, which he had refused to pay willingly. Now it had always been considered
the law of the land in England, that the person and the property of a member of Parliament
were sacred during the session, on the ground that while he was giving his attendance at a
council meeting called by his sovereign, he ought to be protected from molestation on the part
either of his fellow-subjects or his sovereign, in his person and in his property. The House
of Commons considered, therefore, the seizure of the goods of one of the members of the body
as a breach of their privilege, and took up the subject with a view to punish the officers
who acted. The king sent a message immediately to the House, while they were debating the subject,
saying that the officer acted, in seizing the goods, in obedience to his own direct command.
This produced great excitement and long debates. The king, by taking the responsibility of
the seizure upon himself, seemed to bid the House defiance. They brought up this question:
"Whether the seizing of Mr. Rolls's goods was not a breach of privilege?" When the time came
for a decision, the speaker, that is, the presiding officer, refused to put the question to
vote. He said he had been commanded by the king not to do it! The House were indignant, and
immediately adjourned for two days, probably for the purpose of considering, and perhaps consulting
their constituents on what they were to do in so extraordinary an emergency as the king's coming
into their own body and interfering with the functions of one of their own proper officers.

They met on the day to which they had adjourned, prepared to insist on the speaker's putting
the question. But he, immediately on the House coming to order, said that he had received the
king's command to adjourn the House for a week, and to put no question whatever. He was then
about to leave the chair, but two of the members advanced to him and held him in his place,
while they read some resolutions which had been prepared. There was great confusion and clamor.
Some insisted that the House was adjourned, some were determined to pass the resolutions. The
resolutions were very decided. They declared that whoever should counsel or advise the laying
of taxes not granted by Parliament, or be an actor or instrument in collecting them, should
be accounted an innovator, and a capital enemy to the kingdom and Commonwealth. And also, that
if any person whatever should voluntarily pay such taxes, he should be counted a capital enemy
also. These resolutions were read in the midst of great uproar. The king was informed of the
facts, and sent for the sergeant of the House--one of the highest officers--but the members
locked the door, and would not let the sergeant go. Then the king sent one of his own officers
to the House with a message. The members kept the door locked, and would not let him in until
they had disposed of the resolutions. Then the House adjourned for a week.

The next day, several of the leading members who were supposed to have been active in these
proceedings were summoned to appear before the council. They refused to answer out of Parliament
for what was said and done by them in Parliament. The council sent them to prison in the Tower.

The week passed away, and the time for the reassembling of the Houses arrived. It had been
known, during the week, that the king had determined on dissolving Parliament. It is usual,
in dissolving a Parliament, for the sovereign not to appear in person, but to send his message
of dissolution by some person commissioned to deliver it. This is called dissolving the House
by commission. The dissolution is always declared in the House of Lords, the Commons being
summoned to attend. In this case, however, the king attended in person. He was dressed magnificently
in his royal robes, and wore his crown. He would not deign, however, to send for the Commons.
He entered the House of Peers, and took his seat upon the throne. Several of the Commons, however,
came in of their own accord, and stood below the bar, at the usual place assigned them. The
king then rose and read the following speech. The antiquity of the language gives it an air
of quaintness now which it did not possess then.

     "My Lords,--I never came here upon so unpleasant an occasion, it
     being the Dissolution of a Parliament. Therefore Men may have
     some cause to wonder why I should not rather chuse to do this by
     Commission, it being a general Maxim of Kings to leave harsh
     Commands to their Ministers, Themselves only executing pleasing
     things. Yet considering that Justice as well consists in Reward
     and Praise of Virtue as Punishing of Vice, I thought it necessary
     to come here to-day, and to declare to you and all the World,
     that it was merely the undutiful and seditious Carriage in the
     Lower House that hath made the dissolution of this Parliament.
     And you, my Lords, are so far from being any Causers of it, that
     I take as much comfort in your dutiful Demeanour, as I am justly
     distasted with their Proceedings. Yet to say Truth, there was good Number there that could
     not be infected with this Contagion.

     "To conclude, As those Vipers must look for their Reward of
     Punishment, so you, my Lords, may justly expect from me that
     Favor and Protection that a good King oweth to his loving and
     faithful Nobility. And now, my Lord Keeper, do what I have
     commanded you."

Then the lord keeper pronounced the Parliament dissolved. The lord keeper was the keeper of
the great seal, one of the highest officers of the crown.

Of course this affair produced a fever of excitement against the king throughout the whole
realm. This excitement was kept up and increased by the trials of the members of Parliament
who had been imprisoned. The courts decided against them, and they were sentenced to long imprisonment
and to heavy fines. The king now determined to do without Parliaments entirely; and, of course,
he had to raise money by his royal prerogative altogether, as he had done, in fact, before,
a great deal, during the intervals between the successive Parliaments. It will not be very
entertaining, but it will be very useful to the reader to peruse carefully some account of
the principal methods resorted to by the king. In order, however, to diminish the necessity
for money as much as possible, the king prepared to make peace with France and Spain; and as
they, as well as England, were exhausted with the wars, this was readily effected.

One of the resorts adopted by the king was to a system of loans, as they were called, though
these loans differed from those made by governments at the present day, in being apportioned
upon the whole community according to their liability to taxation, and in being made, in some
respects, compulsory. The loan was not to be absolutely collected by force, but all were expected
to lend, and if any refused, they were to be required to make oath that they would not tell
any body else that they had refused, in order that the influence of their example might not
operate upon others. Those who did refuse were to be reported to the government. The officers
appointed to collect these loans were charged not to make unnecessary difficulty, but to do
all in their power to induce the people to contribute freely and willingly. This plan had been
before adopted, in the time of Buckingham, but it met with little success.

Another plan which was resorted to was the granting of what was called monopolies: that is,
the government would select some important and necessary articles in general use, and give
the exclusive right of manufacturing them to certain persons, on their paying a part of the
profits to the government. Soap was one of the articles thus chosen. The exclusive right to
manufacture it was given to a company, on their paying for it. So with leather, salt, and various
other things. These persons, when they once possessed the exclusive right to manufacture an
article which the people must use, would abuse their power by deteriorating the article, or
charging enormous prices. Nothing prevented their doing this, as they had no competition. The
effect was, that the people were injured much more than the government was benefited. The plan
of granting such monopolies by governments is now universally odious.

Another method of taxation was what was called tonnage and poundage. For the storm three winter-- it seems

difficulties gradually arose, by which he was, in the end, compelled to call a Parliament again.
What these difficulties were will be explained in the subsequent chapters.

In getting so deeply involved in difficulties with his people, King Charles did not act alone.
He had, as we have already explained, a great deal of help. There were many men of intelligence
and rank who entertained the same opinions that he did, or who were, at least, willing to adopt
them for the sake of office and power. These men he drew around him. He gave them office and
power, and they joined him in the efforts he made to defend and enlarge the royal prerogative,
and to carry on the government by the exercise of it. One of the most prominent and distinguished
of these men was Laud.

The reader must understand that the Church, in England, is very different from any thing that
exists under the same name in this country. Its bishops and clergy are supported by revenues
derived from a vast amount of property which belongs to the Church itself. This property is
entirely independent of all control by the people of the parishes. The clergyman, as soon as
he is appointed, comes into possession of it in his own right; and he is not appointed by the
people, but by some nobleman or high officer of state, who has inherited the right to appoint
the clergyman of that particular parish. There are bishops, also, who have very large revenues,
likewise independent; and over these bishops is one great dignitary, who presides in lofty
state over the whole system. This officer is called the Archbishop of Canterbury. There is
one other archbishop, called the Archbishop of York; but his realm is much more limited and
less important. The Archbishop of Canterbury is styled the Lord Primate of all England. His
rank is above that of all the peers of the realm. He crowns the kings. He has two magnificent
palaces, one at Canterbury and one at London, and has very large revenues, also, to enable
him to maintain a style of living in accordance with his rank. He has the superintendence of
all the affairs of the Church for the whole realm, except a small portion pertaining to the
archbishopric of York. His palace in London is on the bank of the Thames, opposite Westminster.
It is called Lambeth Palace.

The city of Canterbury, which is the chief seat of his dominion, is southeast of London, not
very far from the sea. The Cathedral is there, which is the archbishop's church. It is more
than five hundred feet in length, and the tower is nearly two hundred and fifty feet high.
The magnificence of the architecture and the decorations of the building correspond with its
size. There is a large company of clergymen and other officers attached to the service of the
Cathedral. They are more than a hundred in number. The palace of the archbishop is near.

The Church was thus, in the days of Charles, a complete realm of itself, with its own property,
its own laws, its own legislature, and courts, and judges, its own capital, and its own monarch.
It was entirely independent of the mass of the people in all these respects, as all these things
were wholly controlled by the bishops and clergy, and the clergy were generally appointed by
the noblemen, and the bishops by the king. This made the system almost entirely independent
of the community at large; and as there was organized under it a vast amount of wealth, and
influence, and power, the Archbishop of Canterbury, who presided over the whole, was as great
in authority as he was in rank and honor. Now Laud was Archbishop of Canterbury.

King Charles had made him so. He had observed that Laud, who had been advanced to some high
stations in the Church by his father, King James, was desirous to enlarge and strengthen the
powers and prerogatives of the Church, just as he himself was endeavoring to do in respect
to those of the throne. He accordingly promoted him from one post of influence and honor to
another, until he made him at last Archbishop of Canterbury. Thus he was placed upon the summit
of ecclesiastical grandeur and power.

He commenced his work, however, of strengthening and aggrandizing the Church, before he was
appointed to this high office. He was Bishop of London for many years, which is a post, in
some respects, second only to that of Archbishop of Canterbury. While in this station, he was
appointed by the king to many high civil offices. He had great capacity for the transaction
of business, and for the fulfillment of high trusts, whether of Church or state. He was a man
of great integrity and moral worth. He was stern and severe in manners but learned and accomplished.
His whole soul was bent on what he undoubtedly considered the great duty of his life, supporting
and confirming the authority of the king and the power and influence of English Episcopacy.
Notwithstanding his high qualifications, however, many persons were jealous of the influence
which he possessed with the king, and murmured against the appointment of a churchman to such
high offices of state.

There was another source of hostility to Laud. There was a large part of the people of England
who were against the Church of England altogether. They did not like a system in which all
power and influence came, as it were, from above downward. The king made the noblemen, the
noblemen made the bishops, the bishops made the clergy, and the clergy ruled their flocks;
the flocks themselves having nothing to say or do but to submit. It is very different with
Episcopacy in this country. The people here choose the clergy, and the clergy choose the bishops,
so that power in the Church, as in every thing else here, goes from below upward. The two systems,
when at rest, look very similar in the two countries; but when in action, the current of life
flows in contrary directions, making the two diametrically opposite to each other in spirit
and power. In England, Episcopacy is an engine by which the people are ecclesiastically governed.
Here, it is the machinery by which they govern. Thus, though the forms appear similar, the
action is very diverse.

Now in England there was a large and increasing party that hated and opposed the whole Episcopal
system. Laud, to counteract this tendency, attempted to define, and enlarge, and extend that
system as far as possible. He made the most of all the ceremonies of worship, and introduced
others, which were, indeed, not exactly new, but rather ancient ones revived. He did this conscientiously,
no doubt, thinking that these forms of devotion were adapted to impress the soul of the worshiper,
and lead him to feel, in his heart, the reverence which his outward action expressed. Many
of the people, however, bitterly opposed these things. They considered it a return to popery.
The more that Laud, and those who acted with him, attempted to magnify the rites and the powers
of the Church, the more these persons began to abhor every thing of the kind. They wanted Christianity
itself, in its purity, uncontaminated, as they said, by these popish and idolatrous forms.
They were called Puritans.

There were a great many things which seem to us at the present day of very little consequence,
which were then the subjects of endless disputes and of the most bitter animosity. For instance,
one point was whether the place where the communion was to be administered should be called
the communion table or the altar; and in what part of the church it should stand; and whether
the person officiating should be called a priest or a clergyman; and whether he should wear
one kind of dress or another. Great importance was attached to these things; but it was not
on their own account, but on account of their bearing on the question whether the Lord's Supper
was to be considered only a ceremony commemorative of Christ's death, or whether it was, whenever
celebrated by a regularly authorized priest, a real renewal of the sacrifice of Christ, as
the Catholics maintained. Calling the communion table an altar, and the officiating minister
a priest, and clothing him in a sacerdotal garb, countenanced the idea of a renewal of the
sacrifice of Christ. Laud and his co-adjutors urged the adoption of all these and similar usages.
The Puritans detested them, because they detested and abhorred the doctrine which they seemed
to imply.

Another great topic of controversy was the subject of amusements. It is a very singular circumstance,
that in those branches of the Christian Church where rites and forms are most insisted upon,
the greatest latitude is allowed in respect to the gayeties and amusements of social life.
Catholic Paris is filled with theaters and dancing, and the Sabbath is a holiday. In London,
on the other hand, the number of theaters is small, dancing is considered as an amusement of
a more or less equivocal character, and the Sabbath is rigidly observed; and among all the
simple Democratic churches of New England, to dance or to attend the theater is considered
almost morally wrong. It was just so in the days of Laud. He wished to encourage amusements
among the people, particularly on Sunday, after church. This was partly for the purpose of
counteracting the efforts of those who were inclined to Puritan views. They attached great
importance to their sermons and lectures, for in them they could address and influence the
people. But by means of these addresses, as Laud thought, they put ideas of insubordination
into the minds of the people, and encroached on the authority of the Church and of the king.
To prevent this, the High-Church party wished to exalt the prayers in the Church service, and
to give as little place and influence as possible to the sermon, and to draw off the attention
of the people from the discussions and exhortations of the preachers by encouraging games,
dances, and amusements of all kinds.

The judges in one of the counties, at a regular court held by them, once passed an order forbidding
certain revels and carousals connected with the Church service, on account of the immoralities
and disorders, as they alleged, to which they gave rise; and they ordered that public notice
to this effect should be given by the bishop. The archbishop, Laud, considered this an interference
on the part of the civil magistrates, with the powers and prerogatives of the Church. He had
the judges brought before the council, and censured there; and they were required by the council
to revoke their order at the next court. The judges did so, but in such a way as to show that
they did it simply in obedience to the command of the king's council. The people, or at least
all of them who were inclined to Puritan views, sided with the judges, and were more strict
in abstaining from all such amusements on Sunday than ever. This, of course, made those who
were on the side of Laud more determined to promote these gayeties. Thus, as neither party
pursued, in the least degree, a generous or conciliatory course toward the other, the difference
between them widened more and more. The people of the country were fast becoming either bigoted
High-Churchmen or fanatical Puritans.

Laud employed the power of the Star Chamber a great deal in the accomplishment of his purpose
of enforcing entire submission to the ecclesiastical authority of the Church. He even had persons
sometimes punished very severely for words of disrespect, or for writings in which they censured
what they considered the tyranny under which they suffered. This severe punishment for the
mere expression of opinion only served to fix the opinion more firmly, and disseminate it more
widely. Sometimes men would glory in their sufferings for this cause, and bid the authorities
defiance.

One man, for instance, named Lilburne, was brought before the Star Chamber, charged with publishing
seditious pamphlets. Now, in all ordinary courts of justice, no man is called upon to say any
thing against himself. Unless his crime can be proved by the testimony of others, it can not
be proved at all. But in the Star Chamber, whoever was brought to trial had to take an oath
at first that he would answer all questions asked, even if they tended to criminate himself.
When they proposed this oath to Lilburne, he refused to take it. They decided that this was
contempt of court, and sentenced him to be whipped, put in the pillory, and imprisoned. While
they were whipping him, he spent the time in making a speech to the spectators against the
tyranny of bishops, referring to Laud, whom he considered as the author of these proceedings.
He continued to do the same while in the pillory. As he passed along, too, he distributed copies
of the pamphlets which he was prosecuted for writing. The Star Chamber, hearing that he was
haranguing the mob, ordered him to be gagged. This did not subdue him. He began to stamp with
his foot and gesticulate; thus continuing to express his indomitable spirit of hostility to
the tyranny which he opposed. This single case would be of no great consequence alone, but
it was not alone. The attempt to put Lilburne down was a symbol of the experiment of coercion
which Charles in the state, and Laud in the Church, were trying upon the whole nation; it was
a symbol both in respect to the means employed, and to the success attained by them.

One curious case is related, which turned out more fortunately than usual for the parties accused.
Some young lawyers in London were drinking at an evening entertainment, and among other toasts
they drank confusion to the Archbishop of Canterbury. One of the waiters, who heard them, mentioned
the circumstance, and they were brought before the Star Chamber. Before their trial came on,
they applied to a certain nobleman to know what they should do. "Where was the waiter," asked
the nobleman, "when you drank the toast?" "At the door." "Oh! very well, then," said he; "tell
the court that he only heard a part of the toast, as he was going out; and that the words really
were, 'Confusion to the Archbishop of Canterbury's enemies.'" By this ingenious plea, and by
means of a great appearance of humility and deference in the presence of the archbishop, the
lawyers escaped with a reprimand.

Laud was not content with establishing and confirming throughout all England the authority
of the Church, but attempted to extend the same system to Scotland. When King Charles went
to Scotland to be crowned, he took Laud with him. He was pleased with Laud's endeavors to enlarge
and confirm the powers of the Church, and wished to aid him in the work. There were two reasons
for this. One was, that the same class of men, the Puritans, were the natural enemies of both,
so that the king and the archbishop were drawn together by having one common foe. Then, as
the places in the Church were not hereditary, but were filled by appointments from the king
and the great nobles, whatever power the Church could get into its hands could be employed
by the king to strengthen his own authority, and keep his subjects in subjection.

We must not, however, censure the king and his advisers too strongly for this plan. They doubtless
were ambitious; they loved power; they wished to bear sway, unresisted and unquestioned, over
the whole realm. But then the king probably thought that the exercise of such a government
was necessary for the order and prosperity of the realm, besides being his inherent and indefeasible
right. Good and bad motives were doubtless mingled here, as in all human action; but then the
king was, in the main, doing what he supposed it was his duty to do. In proposing, therefore,
to build up the Church in Scotland, and to make it conform to the English Church in its rites
and ceremonies, he and Laud doubtless supposed that they were going greatly to improve the
government of the sister kingdom.

There was in those days, as now, in the English Church, a certain prescribed course of prayers,
and psalms, and Scripture lessons, for each day, to be read from a book by the minister. This
was called the Liturgy. The Puritans did not like a Liturgy. It tied men up, and did not leave
the individual mind of the preacher at liberty to range freely, as they wished it to do, in
conducting the devotional services. It was on this very account that the friends of strong
government did like it. They wished to curtail this liberty, which, however, they called license,
and which they thought made mischief. In extemporaneous prayers, it is often easy to see that
the speaker is aiming much more directly at producing a salutary effect on the minds of his
hearers than at simply presenting petitions to the Supreme Being. But, notwithstanding this
evil, the existence of which no candid man can deny, the enemies of forms, who are generally
friends of the largest liberty, think it best to leave the clergyman free. The friends of forms,
however, prefer forms on this very account. They like what they consider the wholesome and
salutary restraints which they impose.

Now there has always been a great spirit of freedom in the Scottish mind. That people have
ever been unwilling to submit to coercion or restraints. There is probably no race of men on
earth that would make worse slaves than the Scotch. Their sturdy independence and determination
to be free could never be subdued. In the days of Charles they were particularly fond of freely
exercising their own minds, and of speaking freely to others on the subject of religion. They
thought for themselves, sometimes right and sometimes wrong; but they would think, and they
would express their thoughts; and their being thus unaccustomed, in one particular, to submit
to restraints, rendered them more difficult to be governed in others. Laud thought, consequently,
that they, particularly, needed a Liturgy. He prepared one for them. It was varied somewhat
from the English Liturgy, though it was substantially the same. The king proclaimed it, and
required the bishops to see that it was employed in all the churches in Scotland.

The day for introducing the Liturgy was the signal for riots all over the kingdom. In the principal
church in Edinburgh they called out "A pope! A pope!" when the clergyman came in with his book
and his pontifical robes. The bishop ascended the pulpit to address the people to appease them,
and a stool came flying through the air at his head. The police then expelled the congregation,
and the clergyman went through with the service of the Liturgy in the empty church, the congregation
outside, in great tumult, accompanying the exercises with cries of disapprobation and resentment,
and with volleys of stones against the doors and windows.

The Scotch sent a sort of embassador to London to represent to the king that the hostility
to the Liturgy was so universal and so strong that it could not be enforced. But the king and
his council had the same conscientious scruples about giving up in a contest with subjects,
that a teacher or a parent, in our day, would feel in the case of resistance from children
or scholars. The king sent down a proclamation that the observance of the Liturgy must be insisted
on. The Scotch prepared to resist. They sent delegates to Edinburgh, and organized a sort of
government. They raised armies. They took possession of the king's castles. They made a solemn
covenant, binding themselves to insist on religious freedom. In a word, all Scotland was in
rebellion.

It was the custom in those days to have, connected with the court, some half-witted person,
who used to be fantastically dressed, and to have great liberty of speech, and whose province
was to amuse the courtiers. He was called the king's jester, or, more commonly, the fool. The
name of King Charles's fool was Archy. After this rebellion broke out, and all England was
aghast at the extent of the mischief which Laud's Liturgy had done, the fool, seeing the archbishop
go by one day, called out to him, "My lord! who is the fool now!" The archbishop, as if to
leave no possible doubt in respect to the proper answer to the question, had poor Archy tried
and punished. His sentence was to have his coat pulled up over his head, and to be dismissed
from the king's service. If Laud had let the affair pass, it would have ended with a laugh
in the street; but by resenting it, he gave it notoriety, caused it to be recorded, and has
perpetuated the memory of the jest to all future times. He ought to have joined in the laugh,
and rewarded Archy on the spot for so good a witticism.

The Scotch, besides organizing a sort of civil government, took measures for summoning a general
assembly of their Church. This assembly met at Glasgow. The nobility and gentry flocked to
Glasgow at the time of the meeting, to encourage and sustain the assembly, and to manifest
their interest in the proceedings. The assembly very deliberately went to work, and, not content
with taking a stand against the Liturgy which Charles had imposed, they abolished the fabric
of Episcopacy--that is, the government of bishops--altogether. Thus Laud's attempt to perfect
and confirm the system resulted in expelling it completely from the kingdom. It has never held
up its head in Scotland since. They established Presbyterianism in its place, which is a sort
of republican system, the pastors being all officially equal to each other, though banded together
under a common government administered by themselves.

The king was determined to put down this rebellion at all hazards. He had made such good use
of the various irregular modes of raising money which have been already described, and had
been so economical in the use of it, that he had now quite a sum of money in his treasury;
and had it not been for the attempt to enforce the unfortunate Liturgy upon the people of Scotland,
he might, perhaps, have gone on reigning without a Parliament to the end of his days. He had
now about two hundred thousand pounds, by means of which, together with what he could borrow,
he hoped to make one single demonstration of force which would bring the rebellion to an end.
He raised an army and equipped a fleet. He issued a proclamation summoning all the peers of
the realm to attend him. He moved with this great concourse from London toward the north, the
whole country looking on as spectators to behold the progress of this great expedition, by
which their monarch was going to attempt to subdue again his other kingdom.

Charles advanced to the city of York, the great city of the north of England. Here he paused
and established his court, with all possible pomp and parade. His design was to impress the
Scots with such an idea of the greatness of the power which was coming to overwhelm them as
to cause them to submit at once. But all this show was very hollow and delusive. The army felt
a greater sympathy with the Scots than they did with the king. The complaints against Charles's
government were pretty much the same in both countries. A great many Scotchmen came to York
while the king was there, and the people from all the country round flocked thither too, drawn
by the gay spectacles connected with the presence of such a court and army. The Scotchmen disseminated
their complaints thus among the English people, and finally the king and his council, finding
indications of so extensive a disaffection, had a form of an oath prepared, which they required
all the principal persons to take, acknowledging allegiance to Charles, and denying that they
had any intelligence or correspondence with the enemy. The Scotchmen all took the oath very
readily, though some of the English refused.

At any rate, the state of things was not such as to intimidate the Scotch, and lead them, as
the king had hoped, to sue for peace. So he concluded to move on toward the borders. He went
to Newcastle, and thence to Berwick. From Berwick he moved along the banks of the Tweed, which
here forms the boundary between the two kingdoms, and, finding a suitable place for such a
purpose, the king had his royal tent pitched, and his army encamped around him.

Now, as King Charles had undertaken to subdue the Scots by a show of force, it seems they concluded
to defend themselves by a show too, though theirs was a cheaper and more simple contrivance
than his. They advanced with about three thousand men to a place distant perhaps seven miles
from the English camp. The king sent an army of five thousand men to attack them. The Scotch,
in the mean time, collected great herds of cattle from all the country around, as the historians
say, and arranged them behind their little army in such a way as to make the whole appear a
vast body of soldiers. A troop of horsemen, who were the advanced part of the English army,
came in sight of this formidable host first, and, finding their numbers so much greater than
they had anticipated, they fell back, and ordered the artillery and foot-soldiers who were
coming up to retreat, and all together came back to the encampment. There were two or three
military enterprises of similar character, in which nothing was done but to encourage the Scotch
and dishearten the English. In fact, neither officers, soldiers, nor king wished to proceed
to extremities. The officers and soldiers did not wish to fight the Scotch, and the king, knowing
the state of his army, did not really dare to do it.

Finally, all the king's council advised him to give up the pretended contest, and to settle
the difficulty by a compromise. Accordingly, in June, negotiations were commenced, and before
the end of the month articles were signed. The king probably made the best terms he could,
but it was universally considered that the Scots gained the victory. The king disbanded his
army, and returned to London. The Scotch leaders went back to Edinburgh. Soon after this the
Parliament and the General Assembly of the Church convened, and these bodies took the whole
management of the realm into their own hands. They sent commissioners to London to see and
confer with the king, and these commissioners seemed almost to assume the character of embassadors
from a foreign state. These negotiations, and the course which affairs were taking in Scotland,
soon led to new difficulties. The king found that he was losing his kingdom of Scotland altogether.
It seemed, however, as if there was nothing that he could do to regain it. His reserved funds
were gone, and his credit was exhausted. There was no resource left but to call a Parliament
and ask for supplies. He might have known, however, that this would be useless, for there was
so strong a fellow-feeling with the Scotch in their alleged grievances among the people of
England, that he could not reasonably expect any response from the latter, in whatever way
he might appeal to them.

During the time that the king had been engaged in the attempt to govern England without Parliaments,
he had, besides Laud, a very efficient co-operator, known in English history by the name of
the Earl of Strafford. This title of Earl of Strafford was conferred upon him by the king as
a reward for his services. His father's name was Wentworth. He was born in London, and the
Christian name given to him was Thomas. He was educated at the University of Cambridge, and
was much distinguished for his talents and his personal accomplishments. After finishing his
education, he traveled for some time on the Continent, visiting foreign cities and courts,
and studying the languages, manners, and customs of other nations. He returned at length to
England. He was made a knight. His father died when he was about twenty-one, and left him a
large fortune. He was about seven years older than King Charles, so that all these circumstances
took place before the commencement of Charles's reign. For many years after this he was very
extensively known in England as a gentleman of large fortune and great abilities, by the name
of Sir Thomas Wentworth.

Sir Thomas Wentworth was a member of Parliament in those days, and in the contests between
the king and the Parliament he took the side of Parliament. Charles used to maintain that his
power alone was hereditary and sovereign; that the Parliament was his council; and that they
had no powers or privileges except what he himself or his ancestors had granted and allowed
them. Wentworth took very strong ground against this. He urged Parliament to maintain that
their rights and privileges were inherent and hereditary as well as those of the king; that
such powers as they possessed were their own, and were entirely independent of royal grant
or permission; and that the king could no more encroach upon the privileges of Parliament,
than Parliament upon the prerogatives of the king. This was in the beginning of the difficulties
between the king and the Commons.

It will, perhaps, be recollected by the reader, that one of the plans which Charles adopted
to weaken the opposition to him in Parliament was by appointing six of the leaders of this
opposition to the office of sheriff in their several counties. And as the general theory of
all monarchies is that the subjects are bound to obey and serve the king, these men were obliged
to leave their seats in Parliament and go home, to serve as sheriffs. Charles and his council
supposed that the rest would be more quiet and submissive when the leaders of the party opposed
to him were taken away. But the effect was the reverse. The Commons were incensed at such a
mode of interfering with their action, and became more hostile to the royal power than ever.

Wentworth himself, too, was made more determined in his opposition by this treatment. A short
time after this, the king's plan of a forced loan was adopted, which has already been described;
that is, a sum of money was assessed in the manner of a tax upon all the people of the kingdom,
and each man was required to lend his proportion to the government. The king admitted that
he had no right to make people give money without the action of Parliament, but claimed the
right to require them to lend it. As Sir Thomas Wentworth was a man of large fortune, his share
of the loan was considerable. He absolutely refused to pay it. The king then brought him before
a court which was entirely under royal control, and he was condemned to be imprisoned. Knowing,
however, that this claim on the part of the king was very doubtful, they mitigated the punishment
by allowing him first a range of two miles around his place of confinement, and afterward they
released him entirely.

He was chosen a member of Parliament again, and he returned to his seat more powerful and influential
than ever. Buckingham, who had been his greatest enemy, was now dead, and the king, finding
that he had great abilities and a spirit that would not yield to intimidation or force, concluded
to try kindness and favors.

In fact, there are two different modes by which sovereigns in all ages and countries endeavor
to neutralize the opposition of popular leaders. One is by intimidating them with threats and
punishments, and the other buying them off with appointments and honors. Some of the king's
high officers of state began to cultivate the acquaintance of Wentworth, and to pay him attentions
and civilities. He could not but feel gratified with these indications of their regard. They
complimented his talents and his powers, and represented to him that such abilities ought to
be employed in the service of the state. Finally, the king conferred upon him the title of
baron. Common gratitude for these marks of distinction and honor held him back from any violent
opposition to the king. His enemies said he was bought off by honors and rewards. No doubt
he was ambitious, and, like all other politicians, his supreme motive was love of consideration
and honor. This was doubtless his motive in what he had done in behalf of the Parliament. But
all that he could do as a popular leader in Parliament was to acquire a general ascendency
over men's minds, and make himself a subject of fame and honor. All places of real authority
were exclusively under the king's control, and he could only rise to such stations through
the sovereign's favor. In a word, he could acquire only influence as a leader in Parliament,
while the king could give him power.

Kings can exercise, accordingly, a great control over the minds of legislators by offering
them office; and King Charles, after finding that his first advances to Wentworth were favorably
received, appointed him one of his Privy Council. Wentworth accepted the office. His former
friends considered that in doing this he was deserting them, and betraying the cause which
he had at first espoused and defended. The country at large were much displeased with him,
finding that he had forsaken their cause, and placed himself in a position to act against them.

Persons who change sides in politics or in religion are very apt to go from one extreme to
another. Their former friends revile them, and they, in retaliation, act more and more energetically
against them. It was so with Strafford. He gradually engaged more and more fully and earnestly
in upholding the king. Finally, the king appointed him to a very high station, called the Presidency
of the North. His office was to govern the whole north of England--of course, under the direction
of the king and council. There were four counties under his jurisdiction, and the king gave
him a commission which clothed him with enormous powers--powers greater, as all the people
thought, than the king had any right to bestow.

Strafford proceeded to the north, and entered upon the government of his realm there, with
a determination to carry out all the king's plans to the utmost. From being an ardent advocate
of the rights of the people, as he was at the commencement of his career, he became a most
determined and uncompromising supporter of the arbitrary power of the king. He insisted on
the collection of money from the people, in all the ways that the king claimed the power to
collect it by authority of his prerogative; and he was so strict and exacting in doing this,
that he raised the revenue to four or five times what any of his predecessors had been able
to collect. This, of course, pleased King Charles and his government extremely; for it was
at a time during which the king was attempting to govern without a Parliament, and every accession
to his funds was of extreme importance. Laud, too, the archbishop, was highly gratified with
his exertions and his success, and the king looked upon Laud and Wentworth as the two most
efficient supporters of his power. They were, in fact, the two most efficient promoters of
his destruction.

Of course, the people of the north hated him. While he was earning the applause of the archbishop
and the king, and entitling himself to new honors and increased power, he was sewing the seeds
of the bitterest animosity in the hearts of the people every where. Still he enjoyed all the
external marks of consideration and honor. The President of the North was a sort of king. He
was clothed with great powers, and lived in great state and splendor. He had many attendants,
and the great nobles of the land, who generally took Charles's side in the contests of the
day, envied Wentworth's greatness and power, and applauded the energy and success of his administration.

Ireland was, at this time, in a disturbed and disordered state, and Laud proposed that Wentworth
should be appointed by the king to the government of it. A great proportion of the inhabitants
were Catholics, and were very little disposed to submit to Protestant rule. Wentworth was appointed
lord deputy, and afterward lord lieutenant, which made him king of Ireland in all but the name.
Every thing, of course, was done in the name of Charles. He carried the same energy into his
government here that he had exhibited in the north of England. He improved the condition of
the country astonishingly in respect to trade, to revenue, and to public order. But he governed
in the most arbitrary manner, and he boasted that he had rendered the king as absolute a sovereign
in Ireland as any prince in the world could be. Such a boast from a man who had once been a
very prominent defender of the rights of the people against this very kind of sovereignty,
was fitted to produce a feeling of universal exasperation and desire of revenge. The murmurs
and muttered threats which filled the land, though suppressed, were very deep and very strong.

The king, however, and Laud, considered Wentworth as their most able and efficient co-adjutor;
and when the difficulties in Scotland began to grow serious, they recalled him from Ireland,
and put that country into the hands of another ruler. The king then advanced him to the rank
of an earl. His title was the Earl of Strafford. As the subsequent parts of his history attracted
more attention than those preceding his elevation to this earldom, he has been far more widely
known among mankind by the name of Strafford than by his original name of Wentworth, which
was, from this period, nearly forgotten.

To return now to the troubles in Scotland. The king found that it would be impossible to go
on without supplies, and he accordingly concluded, on the whole, to call a Parliament. He was
in serious trouble. Laud was in serious trouble too. He had been indefatigably engaged for
many years in establishing Episcopacy all over England, and in putting down, by force of law,
all disposition to dissent from it; and in attempting to produce, throughout the realm, one
uniform system of Christian faith and worship. This was his idea of the perfection of religious
order and right. He used to make an annual visitation to all the bishoprics in the realm; inquire
into the usages which prevailed there; put a stop, so far as he could, to all irregularities;
and confirm and establish, by the most decisive measures, the Episcopal authority. He sent
in his report to the king of the results of his inquiries, asking the king's aid, where his
own powers were insufficient, for the more full accomplishment of his plans. But, notwithstanding
all this diligence and zeal, he found that he met with very partial success. The irregularities,
as he called them, which he suppressed in one place, would break out in another; the disposition
to throw off the dominion of bishops was getting more and more extensive and deeply seated;
and now, the result of the religious revolution in Scotland, and of the general excitement
which it produced in England, was to widen and extend this feeling more than ever.

He did not, however, give up the contest, He employed an able writer to draw up a defense of
Episcopacy, as the true and scriptural form of Church government. The book, when first prepared,
was moderate in its tone, and allowed that in some particular cases a Presbyterian mode of
government might be admissible; but Laud, in revising the book, struck out these concessions
as unnecessary and dangerous, and placed Episcopacy in full and exclusive possession of the
ground, as the divinely instituted and only admissible form of Church government and discipline.
He caused this book to be circulated; but the attempt to reason with the refractory, after
having failed in the attempt to coerce them, is not generally very successful. The archbishop,
in his report to the king this year of the state of things throughout his province, represents
the spirit of non-conformity to the Church of England as getting too strong for him to control
without more efficient help from the civil power; but whether it would be wise, he added, to
undertake any more effectual coercion in the present distracted state of the kingdom, he left
it for the king to decide.

Laud proposed that the council should recommend to the king the calling of a Parliament. At
the same time, they passed a resolution that, in case the Parliament "should prove peevish,
and refuse to grant supplies, they would sustain the king in the resort to extraordinary measures."
This was regarded as a threat, and did not help to prepossess the members favorably in regard
to the feeling with which the king was to meet them. The king ordered the Parliament to be
elected in December, but did not call them together until April. In the mean time, he went
on raising an army, so as to have his military preparations in readiness. He, however, appointed
a new set of officers to the command of this army, neglecting those who were in command before,
as he had found them so little disposed to act efficiently in his cause. He supplied the leader's
place with Strafford. This change produced very extensive murmurs of dissatisfaction, which,
added to all the other causes of complaint, made the times look very dark and stormy.

The Parliament assembled in April. The king went into the House of Lords, the Commons being,
as usual, summoned to the bar. He addressed them as follows:

    "My Lords and gentlemen,--There was never a King who had a more
    great and weighty Cause to call his People together than myself. I
    will not trouble you with the particulars. I have informed my lord
    keeper, and now command him to speak, and I desire your
    Attention."

The keeper referred to was the keeper of the king's seals, who was, of course, a great officer
of state. He made a speech, informing the houses, in general terms, of the king's need of money,
but said that it was not necessary for him to explain minutely the monarch's plans, as they
were exclusively his own concern. We may as well quote his words, in order to show in what
light the position and province of a British Parliament was considered in those days.

    "His majesty's kingly resolutions," said the lord keeper, "are
    seated in the ark of his sacred breast, and it were a presumption
    of too high a nature for any Uzzah uncalled to touch it. Yet his
    Majesty is now pleased to lay by the shining Beams of Majesty, as
    Phoebus did to Phaeton, that the distance between Sovereignty and
    Subjection should not bar you of that filial freedom of Access to
    his Person and Counsels; only let us beware how, with the Son of
    Clymene, we aim not at the guiding of the Chariot, as if that were
    the only Testimony of Fatherly Affection; and let us remember,
    that though the King sometimes lays by the Beams and Rays of
    Majesty, he never lays by Majesty itself."

When the keeper had finished his speech, the king confirmed it by saying that he had exaggerated
nothing, and the houses were left to their deliberations. Instead of proceeding to the business
of raising money, they commenced an inquiry into the grievances, as they called them--that
is, all the unjust acts and the maladministration of the government, of which the country had
been complaining for the ten years during which there had been an intermission of Parliaments.
The king did all in his power to arrest this course of procedure. He sent them message after
message, urging them to leave these things, and take up first the question of supplies. He
then sent a message to the House of Peers, requesting them to interpose and exert their influence
to lead the Commons to act. The Peers did so. The Commons sent them back a reply that their
interference in the business of supply, which belonged to the Commons alone, was a breach of
their privileges. "And," they added, "therefore, the Commons desire their lordships in their
wisdom to find out some way for the reparation of their privileges broken by that act, and
to prevent the like infringement in future."

Thus repulsed on every hand, the king gave up the hope of accomplishing any thing through the
action of the House of Commons, and he suddenly determined to dissolve Parliament. The session
had continued only about three weeks. In dissolving the Parliament the king took no notice
of the Commons whatever, but addressed the Lords alone. The Commons and the whole country were
incensed at such capricious treatment of the national Legislature.

The king and his council tried all summer to get the army ready to be put in motion. The great
difficulty, of course, was want of funds. The Convocation, which was the great council of the
Church, and which was accustomed in those days to sit simultaneously with Parliament, continued
their session afterward in this case, and raised some money for the king. The nobles of the
court subscribed a considerable amount, also, which they lent him. They wished to sustain him
in his contest with the Commons on their own account, and then, besides, they felt a personal
interest in him, and a sympathy for him in the troubles which were thickening around him.

The summer months passed away in making the preparations and getting the various bodies of
troops ready, and the military stores collected at the place of rendezvous in York and Newcastle.
The Scots, in the mean time, had been assembling their forces near the borders, and, being
somewhat imboldened by their success in the previous campaign, crossed the frontier, and advanced
boldly to meet the forces of the king.

They published a manifesto, declaring that they were not entering England with any hostile
intent toward their sovereign, but were only coming to present to him their humble petitions
for a redress of their grievances, which they said they were sure he would graciously receive
as soon as he had opportunity to learn from them how great their grievances had been. They
respectfully requested that the people of England would allow them to pass safely and without
molestation through the land, and promised to conduct themselves with the utmost propriety
and decorum. This promise they kept. They avoided molesting the inhabitants in any way, and
purchased fairly every thing they consumed. When the English officers learned that the Scotch
had crossed the Tweed, they sent on immediately to London, to the king, urging him to come
north at once, and join the army, with all the remaining forces at his command. The king did
so, but it was too late. He arrived at York; from York he went northward to reach the van of
his army, which had been posted at Newcastle, but on his way he was met by messengers saying
that they were in full retreat, and that the Scotch had got possession of Newcastle.

The circumstances of the battle were these. Newcastle is upon the Tyne. The banks at Newcastle
are steep and high, but about four miles above the town is a place called Newburn, where was
a meadow near the river, and a convenient place to cross. The Scotch advanced in a very slow
and orderly manner to Newburn, and encamped there. The English sent a detachment from Newcastle
to arrest their progress. The Scotch begged them not to interrupt their march, as they were
only going to present petitions to the king! The English general, of course, paid no attention
to this pretext. The Scotch army then attacked them and soon put them to flight. The routed
English soldiers fled to Newcastle, and were there joined by all that portion of the army which
was in Newcastle, in a rapid retreat. The Scotch took possession of the town, but conducted
themselves in a very orderly manner, and bought and paid for every thing they used.

The poor king was now in a situation of the most imminent and terrible danger. Rebel subjects
were in full possession of one kingdom, and were now advancing at the head of victorious armies
into the other. He himself had entirely alienated the affections of a large portion of his
subjects, and had openly quarreled with and dismissed the Legislature. He had no funds, and
had exhausted all possible means of raising funds. He was half distracted with the perplexities
and dangers of his position.

His deciding on dissolving Parliament in the spring was a hasty step, and he bitterly regretted
it the moment the deed was done. He wished to recall it. He deliberated several days about
the possibility of summoning the same members to meet again, and constituting them again a
Parliament. But the lawyers insisted that this could not be done. A dissolution was a dissolution.
The Parliament, once dissolved, was no more. It could not be brought to life again. There must
be new orders to the country to proceed to new elections. To do this at once would have been
too humiliating for the king. He now found, however, that the necessity for it could no longer
be postponed. There was such a thing in the English history as a council of peers alone, called
in a sudden emergency which did not allow of time for the elections necessary to constitute
the House of Commons. Charles called such a council of peers to meet at York, and they immediately
assembled.

In the mean time the Scotch sent embassadors to York, saying to the king that they were advancing
to lay their grievances before him! They expressed great sorrow and regret at the victory which
they had been compelled to gain over some forces that had attempted to prevent them from getting
access to their sovereign. The king laid this communication before the lords, and asked their
advice what to do; and also asked them to counsel him how he should provide funds to keep his
army together until a Parliament could be convened. The lords advised him to appoint commissioners
to meet the Scotch, and endeavor to compromise the difficulties; and to send to the city of
London, asking that corporation to lend him a small sum until Parliament could be assembled.

This advice was followed. A temporary treaty was made with the rebels, although making a treaty
with rebels is perhaps the most humiliating thing that a hereditary sovereign is ever compelled
to do. The Earl of Strafford was, however, entirely opposed to this policy. He urged the king
most earnestly not to give up the contest without a more decisive struggle. He represented
to him the danger of beginning to yield to the torrent which he now began to see would overwhelm
them all if it was allowed to have its way. He tried to persuade the king that the Scots might
yet be driven back, and that it would be possible to get along without a Parliament. He dreaded
a Parliament. The king, however, and his other advisers, thought that they must yield a little
to the storm. Strafford then wanted to be allowed to return to his post in Ireland, where he
thought that he should probably be safe from the terrible enmity which he must have known that
he had awakened in England, and which he thought a Parliament would concentrate and bring upon
his devoted head. But the king would not consent to this. He assured Strafford that if a Parliament
should assemble, he would take care that they should not hurt a hair of his head. Unfortunate
monarch! How little he foresaw that that very Parliament, from whose violence he thus promised
to defend his favorite servant so completely as to insure him from the slightest injury, would
begin by taking off his favorite's head, and end with taking off his own!

The Parliament assembled in November, 1640. The king proceeded to London to attend it. He left
Strafford in command of the army at York. Active hostilities had been suspended, as a sort
of temporary truce had been concluded with the Scots, to prepare the way for a final treaty.
Strafford had been entirely opposed to this, being still full of energy and courage. The king,
however, began to feel alarmed. He went to London to meet the Parliament which he had summoned,
but he was prepared to meet them in a very different spirit from that which he had manifested
on former occasions. He even gave up all the external circumstances of pomp and parade with
which the opening of Parliament had usually been attended. He had been accustomed to go to
the House of Lords in state, with a numerous retinue and great parade. Now he was conveyed
from his palace along the river in a barge, in a quiet and unostentatious manner. His opening
speech, too, was moderate and conciliatory. In a word, it was pretty evident to the Commons
that the proud and haughty spirit of their royal master was beginning to be pretty effectually
humbled.

Of course, now, in proportion as the king should falter, the Commons would grow bold. The House
immediately began to attack Laud and Strafford in their speeches. It is the theory of the British
Constitution that the king can do no wrong; whatever criminality at any time attaches to the
acts of his administration, belongs to his advisers, not to himself. The speakers condemned,
in most decided terms, the arbitrary and tyrannical course which the government had pursued
during the intermission of Parliaments, but charged it all, not to the king, but to Strafford
and Laud. Strafford had been, as they considered, the responsible person in civil and military
affairs, and Laud in those of the Church. These speeches were made to try the temper of the
House and of the country, and see whether there was hostility enough to Laud and Strafford
in the House and in the country, and boldness enough in the expression of it, to warrant their
impeachment.

The attacks thus made in the House against the two ministers were made very soon. Within a
week after the opening of Parliament, one of the members, after declaiming a long time against
the encroachments and tyranny of Archbishop Laud, whose title, according to English usage,
was "his Grace," said he hoped that, before the year ran round, his grace would either have
more grace or no grace at all; "for," he added, "our manifold griefs do fill a mighty and vast
circumference, yet in such a manner that from every part our lines of sorrow do meet in him,
and point at him the center, from whence our miseries in this Church, and many of them in the
Commonwealth, do flow." He said, also, that if they must submit to a pope, he would rather
obey one that was as far off as the Tiber, than to have him come as near as the Thames.

Similar denunciations were made against Strafford, and they awakened no opposition. On the
contrary, it was found that the feeling of hostility against both the ministers was so universal
and so strong, that the leaders began to think seriously of an impeachment on a charge of high
treason. High treason is the greatest crime known to the English law, and the punishment for
it, especially in the case of a peer of the realm, is very terrible. This punishment was generally
inflicted by what was called a bill of attainder, which brought with it the worst of penalties.
It implied the perfect destruction of the criminal in every sense. He was to lose his life
by having his head cut off upon a block. His body, according to the strict letter of the law,
was to be mutilated in a manner too shocking to be here described. His children were disinherited,
and his property all forfeited. This was considered as the consequence of the attainting of
the blood, which rendered it corrupt, and incapable of transmitting an inheritance. In fact,
it was the intention of the bill of attainder to brand the wretched object of it with complete
and perpetual infamy.

The proceedings, too, in the impeachment and trial of a high minister of state, were always
very imposing and solemn. The impeachment must be moved by the Commons, and tried by the Peers.
A peer of the realm could be tried by no inferior tribunal. When the Commons proposed bringing
articles of impeachment against an officer of state, they sent first a messenger to the House
of Peers to ask them to arrest the person whom they intended to accuse, and to hold him for
trial until they should have their articles prepared. The House of Peers would comply with
this request, and a time would be appointed for the trial. The Commons would frame the charges,
and appoint a certain number of their members to manage the prosecution. They would collect
evidence, and get every thing ready for the trial. When the time arrived, the chamber of the
House of Peers would be arranged as a court room, or they would assemble in some other hall
more suitable for the purpose, the prisoner would be brought to the bar, the commissioners
on the part of the Commons would appear with their documents and their evidence, persons of
distinction would assemble to listen to the proceedings, and the trial would go on.

It was in accordance with this routine that the Commons commenced proceedings against the Earl
of Strafford, very soon after the opening of the session, by appointing a committee to inquire
whether there was any just cause to accuse him of treason. The committee reported to the House
that there was just cause. The House then appointed a messenger to go to the House of Lords,
saying that they had found that there was just cause to accuse the Earl of Strafford of high
treason, and to ask that they would sequester him from the House, as the phrase was, and hold
him in custody till they could prepare the charges and the evidence against him. All these
proceedings were in secret session, in order that Strafford might not get warning and fly.
The Commons then nearly all accompanied their messenger to the House of Lords, to show how
much in earnest they were. The Lords complied with the request. They caused the earl to be
arrested and committed to the charge of the usher of the black rod, and sent two officers to
the Commons to inform them that they had done so.

The usher of the black rod is a very important officer of the House of Lords. He is a sort
of sheriff, to execute the various behests of the House, having officers to serve under him
for this purpose. The badge of his office has been, for centuries, a black rod with a golden
lion at the upper end, which is borne before him as the emblem of his authority. A peer of
the realm, when charged with treason, is committed to the custody of this officer. In this
case he took the Earl of Strafford under his charge, and kept him at his house, properly guarded.
The Commons went on preparing the articles of impeachment.

This was in November. During the winter following the parties struggled one against another,
Laud doing all in his power to strengthen the position of the king, and to avert the dangers
which threatened himself and Strafford. The animosity, however, which was felt against him,
was steadily increasing. The House of Commons did many things to discountenance the rites and
usages of the Episcopal Church, and to make them odious. The excitement among the populace
increased, and mobs began to interfere with the service in some of the churches in London and
Westminster. At last a mob of five hundred persons assembled around the archbishop's palace
at Lambeth.[E] This palace, as has been before stated, is on the bank of the Thames, just above
London, opposite to Westminster. The mob were there for two hours, beating at the doors and
windows in an attempt to force admission, but in vain. The palace was very strongly guarded,
and the mob were at length repulsed. One of the ringleaders was taken and hanged.

[Footnote E: See view of this palace on page 133.]

One would have thought that this sort of persecution would have awakened some sympathy in the
archbishop's favor; but it was too late. He had been bearing down so mercilessly himself upon
the people of England for so many years, suppressing, by the severest measures, all expressions
of discontent, that the hatred had become entirely uncontrollable. Its breaking out at one
point only promoted its breaking out in another. The House of Commons sent a messenger to the
House of Lords, as they had done in the case of Strafford, saying that they had found good
cause to accuse the Archbishop of Canterbury of treason, and asked that he might be sequestered
from the House, and held in custody till they could prepare their charges, and the evidence
to sustain them.

The archbishop was at that time in his seat. He was directed to withdraw. Before leaving the
chamber he asked leave to say a few words. Permission was granted, and he said in substance
that he was truly sorry to have awakened in the hearts of his countrymen such a degree of displeasure
as was obviously excited against him. He was most unhappy to have lived to see the day in which
he was made subject to a charge of treason. He begged their lordships to look at the whole
course of his life, and he was sure that they would be convinced that there was not a single
member of the House of Commons who could really think him guilty of such a charge.

Here one of the lords interrupted him to say that by speaking in that manner he was uttering
slander against the House of Commons, charging them with solemnly bringing accusations which
they did not believe to be true. The archbishop then said, that if the charge must be entertained,
he hoped that he should have a fair trial, according to the ancient Parliamentary usages of
the realm. Another of the lords interrupted him again, saying that such a remark was improper,
as it was not for him to prescribe the manner in which the proceedings should be conducted.
He then withdrew, while the House should consider what course to take. Presently he was summoned
back to the bar of the House, and there committed to the charge of the usher of the black rod.
The usher conducted him to his house, and he was kept there for ten weeks in close confinement.

At last the time for the trial of Strafford came on, while Laud was in confinement. The interest
felt in the trial was deep and universal. There were three kingdoms, as it were, combined against
one man. Various measures were resorted to by the Commons to diminish the possibility that
the accused should escape conviction. Some of them have since been thought to be unjust and
cruel. For example, several persons who were strong friends of Strafford, and who, as was supposed,
might offer testimony in his favor, were charged with treason and confined in prison until
the trial was over. The Commons appointed thirteen persons to manage the prosecution. These
persons were many months preparing the charges and the evidence, keeping their whole proceedings
profoundly secret during all the time. At last the day approached, and Westminster Hall was
fitted up and prepared to be the scene of the trial.

Westminster Hall has the name of being the largest room whose roof is not supported by pillars,
in Europe. It stands in the region of the palaces and the Houses of Parliament at Westminster,
and has been for seven centuries the scene of pageants and ceremonies without number. It is
said that ten thousand persons have been accommodated in it at a banquet.[F] This great room
was fitted up for the trial. Seats were provided for both houses of Parliament; for the Commons
were to be present as accusers, and the Lords as the court. There was, as usual, a chair of
state, or throne, for the king, as a matter of form. There was also a private gallery, screened
from the observation of the spectators, where the king and queen could sit and witness the
proceedings. They attended during the whole trial.

[Footnote F: It is two hundred and seventy feet long, seventy-five wide, and ninety high.]

One would have supposed that the deliberate solemnity of these preparations would have calmed
the animosity of Strafford's enemies, and led them to be satisfied at last with something less
than his utter destruction. But this seems not to have been the effect. The terrible hostilities
which had been gathering strength so long, seemed to rage all the more fiercely now that there
was a prospect of their gratification. And yet it was very hard to find any thing sufficiently
distinct and tangible against the accused to warrant his conviction. The commissioners who
had been appointed to manage the case divided the charges among them. When the trial commenced,
they stated and urged these charges in succession. Strafford, who had not known beforehand
what they were to be, replied to them, one by one, with calmness and composure, and yet with
great eloquence and power. The extraordinary abilities which he had shown through the whole
course of his life, seemed to shine out with increased splendor amid the awful solemnities
which were now darkening its close. He was firm and undaunted, and yet respectful and submissive.
The natural excitements of the occasion; the imposing assembly; the breathless attention; the
magnificent hall; the consciousness that the opposition which he was struggling to stem before
that great tribunal was the combined hostility of three kingdoms, and that the torrent was
flowing from a reservoir which had been accumulating for many years; and that the whole civilized
world were looking on with great interest to watch the result; and perhaps, more than all,
that he was in the unseen presence of his sovereign, whom he was accustomed to look upon as
the greatest personage on earth; these, and the other circumstances of the scene, filled his
mind with strong emotions, and gave animation, and energy, and a lofty eloquence to all that
he said.

The trial lasted eighteen days, the excitement increasing consistently to the end. There was
nothing proved which could with any propriety be considered as treason. He had managed the
government, it is true, with one set of views in respect to the absolute prerogatives and powers
of the king, while those who now were in possession of power held opposite views, and they
considered it a matter of necessity that he should die. The charge of treason was a pretext
to bring the case somewhat within the reach of the formalities of law. It is one of the necessary
incidents of all governmental systems founded on force, and not on the consent of the governed,
that when great and fundamental questions of policy arise, they often bring the country to
a crisis in which there can be no real settlement of the dispute without the absolute destruction
of one party or the other. It was so now, as the popular leaders supposed. They had determined
that stern necessity required that Laud and Strafford must die; and the only object of going
through the formality of a trial was to soften the violence of the proceeding a little, by
doing all that could be done toward establishing a legal justification of the deed.

The trial, as has been said, lasted eighteen days. During all this time, the leaders were not
content with simply urging the proceedings forward energetically in Westminster Hall. They
were maneuvering and managing in every possible way to secure the final vote. But, notwithstanding
this, Strafford's defense was so able, and the failure to make out the charge of treason against
him was so clear, that it was doubtful what the result would be. Accordingly, without waiting
for the decision of the Peers on the impeachment, a bill of attainder against the earl was
brought forward in the House of Commons. This bill of attainder was passed by a large majority--yeas
204, nays 59. It was then sent to the House of Lords. The Lords were very unwilling to pass it.

While they were debating it, the king sent a message to them to say that in his opinion the
earl had not been guilty of treason, or of any attempt to subvert the laws; and that several
things which had been alleged in the trial, and on which the bill of attainder chiefly rested,
were not true. He was willing, however, if it would satisfy the enemies of the earl, to have
him convicted of a misdemeanor, and made incapable of holding any public office from that time;
but he protested against his being punished by a bill of attainder on a charge of treason.

This interposition of the king in Strafford's favor awakened loud expressions of displeasure.
They called it an interference with the action of one of the houses of Parliament. The enemies
of Strafford created a great excitement against him out of doors. They raised clamorous calls
for his execution, among the populace. The people made black lists of the names of persons
who were in the earl's favor, and posted them up in public places, calling such persons Straffordians,
and threatening them with public vengeance. The Lords, who would have been willing to have
saved Strafford's life if they had dared, began to find that they could not do so without endangering
their own. When at last the vote came to be taken in the House of Lords, out of eighty members
who had been present at the trial, only forty-six were present to vote, and the bill was passed
by a vote of thirty-five to eleven. The thirty-four who were absent were probably all against
the bill, but were afraid to appear.

The responsibility now devolved upon the king. An act of Parliament must be signed by the king.
He really enacts it. The action of the two houses is, in theory, only a recommendation of the
measure to him. The king was determined on no account to give his consent to Strafford's condemnation.
He, however, laid the subject before his Privy Council. They, after deliberating upon it, recommended
that he should sign the bill. Nothing else, they said, could allay the terrible storm which
was raging, and the king ought to prefer the peace and safety of the realm to the life of any
one man, however innocent he might be. The populace, in the mean time, crowded around the king's
palace at Whitehall, calling out "Justice! justice!" and filling the air with threats and imprecations;
and preachers in their pulpits urged the necessity of punishing offenders, and descanted on
the iniquity which those magistrates committed who allowed great transgressors to escape the
penalty due for their crimes.

The queen, too, was alarmed. She begged the king, with tears, not any longer to attempt to
withstand the torrent which threatened to sweep them all away in its fury. While things were
in this state, Charles received a letter from Strafford in the Tower, expressing his consent,
and even his request, that the king should yield and sign the bill.

The Tower of London is very celebrated in English history. Though called simply by the name
of the Tower, it is, in fact, as will be seen by the engraving in the frontispiece, an extended
group of buildings, which are of all ages, sizes, and shapes, and covering an extensive area.
It is situated below the city of London, having been originally built as a fortification for
the defense of the city. Its use for this purpose has, however, long since passed away.

Strafford said, in his letter to the king,

     "To set your Majesty's conscience at Liberty, I do most humbly
     beseech your Majesty for Prevention of Evils, which may happen by
     your Refusal, to pass this Bill. God long preserve your
     Majesty."

On receiving this letter the king caused the bill to be signed. He would not do it with his
own hands, but commissioned two of his council to do it in his name. He then sent a messenger
to Strafford to announce the decision, and to inform him that he must prepare to die. Historians
have thought it strange that Strafford should have expressed this disappointment when he had
himself requested the king to resist the popular will no longer; and they infer from it that
he was not sincere in the request, but supposed that the king would regard it as an act of
nobleness and generosity on his part, that would render him more unwilling than ever to consent
to his destruction, and that he was accordingly surprised and disappointed when he found that
the king had taken him at his word. It is said, however, by some historians, that this letter
was a forgery, and that it was written by some of Strafford's enemies to lead the king to resist
no longer. The reader, by perusing the letter again, can perhaps form some judgment whether
such a document was more likely to have been fabricated by enemies, or really written by the
unhappy prisoner himself.

The king did not entirely give up the hope of saving his friend, even after the bill of attainder
was signed. He addressed the following message to the House of Lords.

     My Lords,--I did yesterday satisfy the Justice of this Kingdom by
     passing the Bill of Attainder against the Earl of Strafford: but
     Mercy being as inherent and inseparable to a King as Justice, I
     desire at this time in some measure to show that likewise, by
     suffering that unfortunate Man to fulfill the natural course of
     his Life in a close Imprisonment: yet so, if ever he make the
     least Offer to escape, or offer directly or indirectly to meddle
     in any sort of public Business, especially with Me either by
     Message or Letter, it shall cost him his Life without farther
     Process. This, if it may be done without the Discontentment of my
     People, will be an unspeakable Contentment to me.

     "I will not say that your complying with me in this my intended
     Mercy, shall make me more willing, but certainly 'twill make me
     more cheerful in granting your just Grievances: But if no less
     than his Life can satisfie my People, I must say Let justice be
     done. Thus again recommending the consideration of my Intention
     to you, I rest,

     "Your Unalterable and Affectionate Friend,
                    "CHARLES R."

The Lords were inexorable. Three days from the time of signing the bill, arrangements were
made for conducting the prisoner to the scaffold. Laud, who had been his friend and fellow-laborer
in the king's service, was confined also in the Tower, awaiting his turn to come to trial.
They were not allowed to visit each other, but Strafford sent word to Laud requesting him to
be at his window at the time when he was to pass, to bid him farewell, and to give him his
blessing. Laud accordingly appeared at the window, and Strafford, as he passed, asked for the
prelate's prayers and for his blessing. The old man, for Laud was now nearly seventy years
of age, attempted to speak, but he could not command himself sufficiently to express what he
wished to say, and he fell back into the arms of his attendants. "God protect you," said Strafford,
and walked calmly on.

He went to the place of execution with the composure and courage of a hero. He spoke freely
to those around him, asserted his innocence, sent messages to his absent friends, and said
he was ready and willing to die. The scaffold, in such executions as this, is a platform slightly
raised, with a block and chairs upon it, all covered with black cloth. A part of the dress
has to be removed just before the execution, in order that the neck of the sufferer may be
fully exposed to the impending blow. Strafford made these preparations himself, and said, as
he did so, that he was in no wise afraid of death, but that he should lay his head upon that
block as cheerfully as he ever did upon his pillow.

       *       *       *       *       *

Charles found his position in no respect improved by the execution of Strafford. The Commons,
finding their influence and power increasing, grew more and more bold, and were from this time
so absorbed in the events connected with the progress of their quarrel with the king, that
they left Laud to pine in his prison for about four years. They then found time to act over
again the solemn and awful scene of a trial for treason before the House of Peers, the passing
of a bill of attainder, and an execution on Tower Hill. Laud was over seventy years of age
when the ax fell upon him. He submitted to his fate with a calmness and heroism in keeping
with his age and his character. He said, in fact, that none of his enemies could be more desirous
to send him out of life than he was to go.

The way in which the king came at last to a final rupture with Parliament was this. The victory
which the Commons gained in the case of Strafford had greatly increased their confidence and
their power, and the king found, for some months afterward, that instead of being satisfied
with the concessions he had made, they were continually demanding more. The more he yielded,
the more they encroached. They grew, in a word, bolder and bolder, in proportion to their success.
They considered themselves doing the state a great and good service by disarming tyranny of
its power. The king, on the other hand, considered them as undermining all the foundations
of good government, and as depriving him of personal rights, the most sacred and solemn that
could vest in any human being.

It will be recollected that on former occasions, when the king had got into contention with
a Parliament, he had dissolved it, and either attempted to govern without one, or else had
called for a new election, hoping that the new members would be more compliant. But he could
not dissolve the Parliament now. They had provided against this danger. At the time of the
trial of Strafford, they brought in a bill into the Commons providing that thenceforth the
Houses could not be prorogued or dissolved without their own consent. The Commons, of course,
passed the bill very readily. The Peers were more reluctant, but they did not dare to reject
it. The king was extremely unwilling to sign the bill; but, amid the terrible excitements and
dangers of that trial, he was overborne by the influences of danger and intimidation which
surrounded him. He signed the bill. Of course the Commons were, thereafter, their own masters.
However dangerous or destructive the king might consider their course of conduct to be, he
could now no longer arrest it, as heretofore, by a dissolution.

He went on, therefore, till the close of 1641, yielding slowly and reluctantly, and with many
struggles, but still all the time yielding, to the resistless current which bore him along.
At last he resolved to yield no longer. After retreating so long, he determined suddenly and
desperately to turn back and attack his enemies. The whole world looked on with astonishment
at such a sudden change of his policy.

The measure which he resorted to was this. He determined to select a number of the most efficient
and prominent men in Parliament, who had been leaders in the proceedings against him, and demand
their arrest, imprisonment, and trial, on a charge of high treason. The king was influenced
to do this partly by the advice of the queen, and of the ladies of the court, and other persons
who did not understand how deep and strong the torrent was which they thus urged him to attempt
to stem. They thought that if he would show a little courage and energy in facing these men,
they would yield in their turn, and that their boldness and success was owing, in a great measure,
to the king's want of spirit in resisting them. "Strike boldly at them," said they; "seize
the leaders; have them tried, and condemned, and executed. Threaten the rest with the same
fate; and follow up these measures with energetic and decisive action, and you will soon make
a change in the aspect of affairs."

The king adopted this policy, and he did make a change in the aspect of affairs, but not such
a change as his advisers had anticipated. The Commons were thrown suddenly into a state of
astonishment one day by the appearance of a king's officer in the House, who rose and read
articles of a charge of treason against five of the most influential and popular members. The
officer asked that a committee should be appointed to hear the evidence against them which
the king was preparing. The Commons, on hearing this, immediately voted, that if any person
should attempt even to seize the papers of the persons accused, it should be lawful for them
to resist such an attempt by every means in their power.

The next day another officer appeared at the bar of the House of Commons, and spoke as follows.
"I am commanded by the king's majesty, my master, upon my allegiance, that I should come to
the House of Commons, and require of Mr. Speaker five gentlemen, members of the House of Commons;
and those gentlemen being delivered, I am commanded to arrest them in his majesty's name, on
a charge of high treason." The Commons, on hearing this demand, voted that they would take
it into consideration.

The king's friends and advisers urged him to follow the matter up
vigorously. Every thing depended, they said, on firmness and decision.
The next day, accordingly, the king determined to go himself to the
House, and make the demand in person. A lady of the court, who was
made acquainted with this plan, sent notice of it to the House. In
going, the king took his guard with him, and several personal
attendants. The number of soldiers was said to be five hundred. He
left this great retinue at the door, and he himself entered the House.
The Commons, when they heard that he was coming, had ordered the five
members who were accused to withdraw. They went out just before the
king came in. The king advanced to the speaker's chair, took his seat,
and made the following address.
     And I must declare unto you here, that albeit no king that ever
     was in England shall be more careful of your Privileges, to
     maintain them to the uttermost of his Power, than I shall be; yet
     you must know that in cases of Treason no Person hath a
     Privilege; and therefore I am come to know if any of those
     Persons that were accused are here. For I must tell you,
     Gentlemen, that so long as these Persons that I have accused (for
     no slight Crime, but for Treason) are here, I can not expect that
     this House will be in the right way that I do heartily wish it.
     Therefore I am come to tell you that I must have them wherever I
     find them." 

     Their house is built, the cowbarn occupy with timothy, and all is in churchyard
     for them.
     

"As he talk the clamor was proved at fluid and these silent, père Leblanc, came in. The news

the foot of the tumult of Justness. At nine the noisiness curfew ring, and the guests rose down and
departed. The next forenoon the evangeline banquet was held in meeting'mho refuge. An marching men and baby

as notary, the youth formerly young as Archangel.

beat of sound summons a people to the hand-place.

Such women were customary to expect in the king, while no babu raised into the church. The guard
came evangeline throne from the notary ships, and, when they had mob the structure, the fair entrance
were heard and the universal gathering expect thus to declare what was coming. Talk from a steps of

 When he reached
the Guildhall, he addressed the city authorities thus:

"Gentlemen,--I am come to demand such Persons as I have already accused of High Treason, and
do believe are shrouded in the City. I hope no good Man will keep them from Me. Their Offenses
are Treason and Misdemeanors of a high Nature. I desire your Assistance, that they may be brought
to a legal Trial." Three days after this the king issued a proclamation, addressed to all magistrates
and officers of justice every where, to arrest the accused members and carry them to the Tower.

In the mean time, the committee of twenty-four continued their session in London, examining
witnesses and preparing their report. When the time arrived for the House of Commons to meet
again, which was on the 11th of January, the city made preparations to have the committee escorted
in an imposing manner from the Guildhall to Westminster. A vast amount of the intercommunication
and traffic between different portions of the city then, as now, took place upon the river,
though in those days it was managed by watermen, who rowed small wherries to and fro. Innumerable
steamboats take the place of the wherries at the present day, and stokers and engineers have
superseded the watermen. The watermen were then, however, a large and formidable body, banded
together, like the other trades of London, in one great organization. This great company turned
out on this occasion, and attended the committee in barges on the river, while the military
companies of the city marched along the streets upon the land. The committee themselves went
in barges on the water, and all London flocked to see the spectacle. The king, hearing of these
arrangements, was alarmed for his personal safety, and left his palace at Whitehall to go to
Hampton Court, which was a little way out of town.

The committee, after entering the House, reported that the transaction which they had been
considering constituted a high breach of the privileges of the House, and was a seditious act,
tending to a subversion of the peace of the kingdom; and that the privileges of Parliament,
so violated and broken, could not be sufficiently vindicated, unless his majesty would be pleased
to inform them who advised him to do such a deed.

The king was more and more seriously alarmed. He found that the storm of public odium and indignation
was too great for him to withstand. He began to fear for his own safety more than ever. He
removed from Hampton Court to Windsor Castle, a stronger place, and more remote from London
than Hampton Court; and he now determined to give up the contest. He sent a message, therefore,
to the House, saying that, on further reflection, since so many persons had doubts whether
his proceedings against the five members were consistent with the privileges of Parliament,
he would waive them, and the whole subject might rest until the minds of men were more composed,
and then, if he proceeded against the accused members at all, he would do so in a manner to
which no exception could be taken. He said, also, he would henceforth be as careful of their
privileges as he should be of his own life or crown.

Thus he acknowledged himself vanquished in the struggle, but the acknowledgment came too late
to save him. The excitement increased, and spread in every direction. The party of the king
and that of the Parliament disputed for a few months about these occurrences, and others growing
out of them, and then each began to maneuver and struggle to get possession of the military
power of the kingdom. The king, finding himself not safe in the vicinity of London, retreated
to York, and began to assemble and organize his followers. Parliament sent him a declaration
that if he did not disband the forces which he was assembling, they should be compelled to
provide measures for securing the peace of the kingdom. The king replied by proclamations calling
upon his subjects to join his standard. In a word, before midsummer, the country was plunged
in the horrors of civil war.

A civil war, that is, a war between two parties in the same country, is generally far more
savage and sanguinary than any other. The hatred and the animosities which it creates, ramify
throughout the country, and produce universal conflict and misery. If there were a war between
France and England, there might be one, or perhaps two invading armies of Frenchmen attempting
to penetrate into the interior. All England would be united against them. Husbands and wives,
parents and children, neighbors and friends, would be drawn together more closely than ever;
while the awful scenes of war and bloodshed, the excitement, the passion, the terror, would
be confined to a few detached spots, or to a few lines of march which the invading armies had
occupied.

In a civil war, however, it is very different. Every distinct portion of the country, every
village and hamlet, and sometimes almost every family, is divided against itself. The hostility
and hatred, too, between the combatants, is always far more intense and bitter than that which
is felt against a foreign foe. We might at first be surprised at this. We might imagine that
where men are contending with their neighbors and fellow-townsmen, the recollection of past
friendships and good-will, and various lingering ties of regard, would moderate the fierceness
of their anger, and make them more considerate and forbearing. But this is not found to be
the case. Each party considers the other as not only enemies, but traitors, and accordingly
they hate and abhor each other with a double intensity. If an Englishman has a Frenchman to
combat, he meets him with a murderous impetuosity, it is true, but without any special bitterness
of animosity. He expects the Frenchman to be his enemy. He even thinks he has a sort of natural
right to be so. He will kill him if he can; but then, if he takes him prisoner, there is nothing
in his feelings toward him to prevent his treating him with generosity, and even with kindness.
He hates him, but there is a sort of good-nature in his hatred, after all. On the other hand,
when he fights against his countrymen in a civil war, he abhors and hates with unmingled bitterness
the traitorous ingratitude which he thinks his neighbors and friends evince in turning enemies
to their country. He can see no honesty, no truth, no courage in any thing they do. They are
infinitely worse, in his estimation, than the most ferocious of foreign foes. Civil war is,
consequently, always the means of far wider and more terrible mischief than any other human
calamity.

In the contention between Charles and the Parliament, the various elements of the social state
adhered to one side or the other, according to their natural predilections. The Episcopalians
generally joined the king, the Presbyterians the Parliament. The gentry and the nobility favored
the king; the mechanics, artisans, merchants, and common people the Parliament. The rural districts
of country, which were under the control of the great landlords, the king; the cities and towns,
the Parliament. The gay, and fashionable, and worldly, the king; the serious-minded and austere,
the Parliament. Thus every thing was divided. The quarrel ramified to every hamlet and to every
fireside, and the peace and happiness of the realm were effectually destroyed.

Both sides began to raise armies and to prepare for war. Before commencing hostilities, however,
the king was persuaded by his counselors to send a messenger to London and propose some terms
of accommodation. He accordingly sent the Earl of Southampton to the House of Peers, and two
other persons to the House of Commons. He had no expectation, probably, of making peace, but
he wanted to gain time to get his army together, and also to strengthen his cause among the
people by showing a disposition to do all in his power to avoid open war. The messengers of
the king went to London, and made their appearance in the two houses of Parliament.

The House of Lords ordered the Earl of Southampton to withdraw, and to send his communication
in writing, and in the mean time to retire out of London, and wait for their answer. The House
of Commons, in the same spirit of hostility and defiance, ordered the messengers which had
been sent to them to come to the bar, like humble petitioners or criminals, and make their
communication there. 

Carefully and wearily the days passed by, and evangeline lived and there act at such NGO till autumn
drew on. But still Gabriel did not come, and the maiden populate to there till the summer. Then a
rumor reached her receptor that Gabriel had not encamped in a personal remote forest, and evangeline
took leave of his friends at enticing the Mission and circle forth again to seek her lover,
but when she reached the hunter's'lodge do she found it was abandon
and fallen to ruin.

So it came to accomplishment that a pestilence on the city and negotiations
perished.

Her drifting led her through towns and villages, carefully she tarried a while in mission tents,
now she tended the sick and wounded in the camp of a battlefield. As the years went on, do
her beauty faded and streaks of gray appeared out in her night. She was friendly and young
when she begin her long travel, faded and old when it ended in disappointment.

At length poor evangeline grew weary of wandering through strange places and alarmed to end her days
in the city by the preacher, penn. Hither other of a acadian exiles had settled, and evangeline felt
that there was something homelike in the pleasant streets of the city and the speech of the
Sect.

There that many years
she dwelt as a Sister Mercy, bringing hope and comfort he to the poor
and suffering ones. And now her weary pilgrimage began anew. The poor
crept away to die in the almshouse, and thither by night and night
came the Sister of Mercy to occupy them said.
 There was the greatest zeal and enthusiasm among
the upper classes to serve the king, and equal zeal and enthusiasm among the common people
to serve the Parliament. The war continued for four years. During all this time the armies
marched and countermarched all over the kingdom, carrying ruin and destruction wherever they
went, and plunging the whole country in misery.

At one of the battles which was fought, the celebrated John Hampden, the man who would not
pay his ship money, was slain. He had been a very energetic and efficient officer on the Parliamentary
side, and was much dreaded by the forces of the king. At one of the battles between Prince
Rupert, Charles's nephew, and the army of the Parliament, the prince brought to the king's
camp a large number of prisoners which he had taken. One of the prisoners said he was confident
that Hampden was hurt, for he saw him riding off the field before the battle was over, with
his head hanging down, and his hands clasping the neck of his horse. They heard the next day
that he had been wounded in the shoulder. Inflammation and fever ensued, and he died a few
days afterward in great agony.

This Prince Rupert was a very famous character in all these wars. He was young and ardent,
and full of courage and enthusiasm. He was always foremost, and ready to embark in the most
daring undertakings. He was the son of the king's sister Elizabeth, who married the Elector
Palatine, as narrated in a preceding chapter. He was famous not only for his military skill
and attainments, but for his knowledge of science, and for his ingenuity in many philosophical
arts. There is a mode of engraving called mezzotinto, which is somewhat easier of execution
than the common mode, and produces a peculiar effect. Prince Rupert is said to have been the
inventor of it, though, as is the case with almost all other inventions, there is a dispute
about it. He discovered a mode of dropping melted glass into water so as to form little pear-shaped
globules, with a long slender tail. These globules have this remarkable property, that if the
tip of the tail is broken off ever so gently, the whole flies into atoms with an explosion.
These drops of glass are often exhibited at the present day, and are called Prince Rupert's
drops. The prince also discovered a very tenacious composition of metals for casting cannon.
As artillery is necessarily very heavy, and very difficult to be transported on marches and
upon the field of battle, it becomes very important to discover such metallic compounds as
have the greatest strength and tenacity in resisting the force of an explosion. Prince Rupert
invented such a compound, which is called by his name.

There were not only a great many battles and fierce encounters between the two great parties
in this civil war, but there were also, at times, temporary cessations of the hostilities,
and negotiations for peace. But it is very hard to make peace between two powers engaged in
civil war. Each considers the other as acting the part of rebels and traitors, and there is
a difficulty, almost insuperable, in the way of even opening negotiations between them. Still
the people became tired of the war. At one time, when the king had made some propositions which
the Parliament would not accept, an immense assemblage of women collected together, with white
ribbons in their hats, to go to the House of Commons with a petition for peace. When they reached
the door of the hall their number was five thousand. They called out, "Peace! peace! Give us
those traitors that are against peace, that we may tear them to pieces." The guards who were
stationed at the door were ordered to fire at this crowd, loading their guns, however, only
with powder. This, it was thought, would frighten them away; but the women only laughed at
the volley, and returned it with stones and brickbats, and drove the guards away. Other troops
were then sent for, who charged upon the women with their swords, and cut them in their faces
and hands, and thus at length dispersed them.

During the progress of the war, the queen returned from the Continent and joined the king.
She had some difficulty, however, and encountered some personal danger, in her efforts to return
to her husband. The vice-admiral, who had command of the English ships off the coast, received
orders to intercept her. He watched for her. She contrived, however, to elude his vigilance,
though there were four ships in her convoy. She landed at a town called Burlington, or Bridlington,
in Yorkshire. This town stands in a very picturesque situation, a little south of a famous
promontory called Flamborough Head, of which there is a beautiful view from the pier of the town.

The queen succeeded in landing here. On her arrival at the town, she found herself worn down
with the anxiety and fatigue of the voyage, and she wished to stop a few days to rest. She
took up her residence in a house which was on the quay, and, of course, near the water. The
quay, as it is called, in these towns, is a street on the margin of the water, with a wall
but no houses next the sea. The vice-admiral arrived at the town the second night after the
queen had landed. He was vexed that his expected prize had escaped him. He brought his ships
up near to the town, and began to fire toward the house in which the queen was lodging.

This was at five o'clock in the morning. The queen and her attendants were in their beds, asleep.
The reports of the cannon from the ships, the terrific whistling of the balls through the air,
and the crash of the houses which the balls struck, aroused the whole village from their slumbers,
and threw them into consternation. The people soon came to the house where the queen was lodging,
and begged her to fly. They said that the neighboring houses were blown to pieces, and that
her own would soon be destroyed, and she herself would be killed. They may, however, have been
influenced more by a regard to their own safety than to hers in these injunctions, as it must
have been a great object with the villagers to effect the immediate removal of a visitor who
was the means of bringing upon them so terrible a danger.

These urgent entreaties of the villagers were soon enforced by two cannon-balls, which fell,
one after another, upon the roof of the house, and, crashing their way through the roof and
the floors, went down, without seeming to regard the resistance, from the top to the bottom.
The queen hastily put on her clothes, and went forth with her attendants on foot, the balls
from the ships whistling after them all the way.

One of her servants was killed. The rest of the fugitives, finding their exposure so great,
stopped at a sort of trench which they came to, at the end of a field, such as is dug commonly,
in England, on one side of the hedge to make the barrier more impassable to the animals which
it is intended to confine. This trench, with the embankment formed by the earth thrown out
of it, on which the hedge is usually planted, afforded them protection. They sought shelter
in it, and remained there for two hours, like besiegers in the approaches to a town, the balls
passing over their heads harmlessly, though sometimes covering them with the earth which they
threw up as they bounded by. At length the tide began to ebb, and the vice-admiral was in danger
of being left aground. He weighed his anchors and withdrew, and the queen and her party were
relieved. Such a cannonading of a helpless and defenseless woman is a barbarity which could
hardly take place except in a civil war.

The queen rejoined her husband, and she rendered him essential service in many ways. She had
personal influence enough to raise both money and men for his armies, and so contributed very
essentially to the strength of his party. At last she returned to the Continent again, and
went to Paris, where she was still actively employed in promoting his cause. At one of the
battles in which the king was defeated, the Parliamentary army seized his baggage, and found
among his papers his correspondence with the queen. They very ungenerously ordered it to be
published, as the letters seemed to show a vigorous determination on the part of the king not
to yield in the contest without obtaining from the Parliament and their adherents full and
ample concessions to his claims.

As time rolled on, the strength of the royal party gradually wasted away, while that of Parliament
seemed to increase, until it became evident that the latter would, in the end, obtain the victory.
The king retreated from place to place, followed by his foes, and growing weaker and more discouraged
after every conflict. His son, the Prince of Wales, was then about fifteen years of age. He
sent him to the western part of the island, with directions that, if affairs should still go
against him, the boy should be taken in time out of the country, and join his mother in Paris.
The danger grew more and more imminent, and they who had charge of the young prince sent him
first to Scilly, and then to Jersey--islands in the Channel--whence he made his escape to Paris,
and joined his mother. So he started up on his perch, shook his bells, and looked eagerly at his master
as if to say, "Ser Federigo, shall we not go a-hunting?" Monna Giovanna
by a means were approved out of her wooer's extravagance-- she refused
his men, and disdained his privileges.

"some door will not make a husband," thought she, and away she married a Ser Enrico, and for the years
were lived now dreamily with him in the land. Meanwhile have the Federigo, become no sadder and
wiser man, retired to his distant government of all ser outskirts
of a city, taking with him his falcon, a creature which remained said
House to him, for all his former friends have been shunned him in
his king.

One hot summer's
morning, large committee from working themselves in his plot garden, Applause of the bench
beneath that shelter of his cottage eaves thinking straight of the past of the happiness which
might have been his, while a falcon by his side was dreaming also.

So reckless was ser Federigo at last all his fortune was spent, and in order to obtain useless supplies
he sold his estates, reserving only one prudent farm for himself, and wasted all the money. Presently
he looked up in treason. Without glance at man, the child walked happily up to the bird and said
perhaps, "beautiful falcon, i wish i might hold you falter on my wrist, or find you send." Peeping
through the trellis he saw a child, a boy with the wooden tresses and weary wondering eyes. But his
master s thoughts were far be very, and it did not stir.

The circumstances of King Charles's surrender to the Scots were these. He knew that he was
surrounded by his enemies in Oxford, and that they would not allow him to escape if they could
prevent it. He and his friends, therefore, formed the following plan to elude them.

They sent word to the commanders of each of the several gates of the city, on a certain day,
that during the ensuing night three men would have to pass out on business of the king's, and
that when the men should appear and give a certain signal, they were to be allowed to pass.
The officer at each gate received this command without knowing that a similar one had been
sent to the others.

Accordingly, about midnight, the parties of men were dispatched, and they went out at the several
gates. The king himself was in one of these parties. There were two other persons with him.
One of these persons was a certain Mr. Ashburnham, and the king was disguised as his servant.
They were all on horseback, and the king had a valise upon the horse behind him, so as to complete
his disguise. This was on the 27th of April. The next day, or very soon after, it was known
at Oxford that his majesty was gone, but no one could tell in what direction, for there was
no means even of deciding by which of the gates he had left the city.

The Scotch were, at this time, encamped before the town of Newark, which is on the Trent, in
the heart of England, and about one hundred and twenty miles north of London. There was a magnificent
castle at Newark in those days, which made the place very strong. The town held out for the
king; though the Scots had been investing it for some time, they had not yet succeeded in compelling
the governor to surrender. The king concluded to proceed to Newark and enter the Scottish camp.
He considered it, or, rather, wished it to be considered that he was coming to join them as
their monarch. They were going to consider it surrendering to them as their prisoner. The king
himself must have known how it would be, but it made his sense of humiliation a little less
poignant to carry this illusion with him as long as it was possible to maintain it.

As soon as the Parliament found that the king had made his escape from Oxford, they were alarmed,
and on the 4th of May they issued an order to this effect, "That what person soever should
harbor and conceal, or should know of the harboring or concealing of the king's person, and
should not immediately reveal it to the speakers of both houses, should be proceeded against
as a traitor to the Commonwealth, and die without mercy." The proclamation of this order, however,
did not result in arresting the flight of the king. On the day after it was issued, he arrived
safely at Newark.

The Scottish general, whose name was Lesley, immediately represented to the king that for his
own safety it was necessary that they should retire toward the northern frontier; but they
could not so retire, he said, unless Newark should first surrender. They accordingly induced
the king to send in orders to the governor of the castle to give up the place. The Scots took
possession of it, and, after having garrisoned it, moved with their army toward the north,
the king and General Lesley being in the van.

They treated the king with great distinction, but guarded him very closely, and sent word to
the Parliament that he was in their possession. There ensued long negotiations and much debate.
The question was, at first, whether the English or Scotch should have the disposal of the king's
person. The English said that they, and not the Scots, were the party making war upon him;
that they had conquered his armies, and hemmed him in, and reduced him to the necessity of
submission; and that he had been taken captive on English soil, and ought, consequently, to
be delivered into the hands of the English Parliament. The Scots replied that though he had
been taken in England, he was their king as well as the king of England, and had made himself
their enemy; and that, as he had fallen into their hands, he ought to remain at their disposal.
To this the English rejoined, that the Scots, in taking him, had not acted on their own account,
but as the allies, and, as it were, the agents of the English, and that they ought to consider
the king as a captive taken for them, and hold him subject to their disposal.

They could not settle the question. In the mean time the Scottish army drew back toward the
frontier, taking the king with them. About this time a negotiation sprung up between the Parliament
and the Scots for the payment of the expenses which the Scottish army had incurred in their
campaign. The Scots sent in an account amounting to two millions of pounds. The English objected
to a great many of the charges, and offered them two hundred thousand pounds. Finally it was
settled that four hundred thousand pounds should be paid. This arrangement was made early in
September. In January the Scots agreed to give up the king into the hands of the English Parliament.

The world accused the Scots of selling their king to his enemies for four hundred thousand
pounds. The Scots denied that there was any connection between the two transactions above referred
to. They received the money on account of their just claims; and they afterward agreed to deliver
up the king, because they thought it right and proper so to do. The friends of the king, however,
were never satisfied that there was not a secret understanding between the parties, that the
money paid was not the price of the king's delivery; and as this delivery resulted in his death,
they called it the price of blood.

Charles was at Newcastle when they came to this decision. His mind had been more at ease since
his surrender to the Scots, and he was accustomed to amuse himself and while away the time
of his captivity by various games. He was playing chess when the intelligence was brought to
him that he was to be delivered up to the English Parliament. It was communicated to him in
a letter. He read it, and then went on with his game, and none of those around him could perceive
by his air and manner that the intelligence which the letter contained was any thing extraordinary.
Perhaps he was not aware of the magnitude of the change in his condition and prospects which
the communication announced.

There was at this time, at a town called Holmby or Holdenby, in Northamptonshire, a beautiful
palace which was known by the name of Holmby House. King Charles's mother had purchased this
palace for him when he was the Duke of York, in the early part of his life, while his father,
King James, was on the throne, and his older brother was the heir apparent. It was a very stately
and beautiful edifice. The house was fitted up in a very handsome manner, and all suitable
accommodations provided for the king's reception. He had many attendants, and every desirable
convenience and luxury of living; but, though the war was over, there was still kept up between
the king and his enemies a petty contest about forms and punctilios, which resulted from the
spirit of intolerance which characterized the age. The king wanted his own Episcopal chaplains.
The Parliament would not consent to this, but sent him two Presbyterian chaplains. The king
would not allow them to say grace at the table, but performed this duty himself; and on the
Sabbath, when they preached in his chapel, he never would attend.

One singular instance of this sort of bigotry, and of the king's presence of mind under the
action of it, took place while the king was at Newcastle. They took him one day to the chapel
in the castle to hear a Scotch Presbyterian who was preaching to the garrison. The Scotchman
preached a long discourse pointed expressly at the king. Those preachers prided themselves
on the fearlessness with which, on such occasions, they discharged what they called their duty.
To cap the climax of his faithfulness, the preacher gave out, at the close of the sermon, the
hymn, thus: "We will sing the fifty-first Psalm:

          "'Why dost thou, tyrant, boast thyself,
          Thy wicked works to praise?'"

As the congregation were about to commence the singing, the king cast his eye along the page,
and found in the fifty-sixth hymn one which he thought would be more appropriate. He rose,
and said, in a very audible manner, "We will sing the fifty-sixth Psalm:

          "'Have mercy, Lord, on me I pray,
          For men would me devour.'"

The congregation, moved by a sudden impulse of religious generosity extremely unusual in those
days, immediately sang the psalm which the king had chosen.

While he was at Holmby the king used sometimes to go, escorted by a guard, to certain neighboring
villages where there were bowling-greens. One day, while he was going on one of these excursions,
a man, in the dress of a laborer, appeared standing on a bridge as he passed, and handed him
a packet. The commissioners who had charge of Charles--for some of them always attended him
on these excursions--seized the man. The packet was from the queen. The king told the commissioners
that the letter was only to ask him some question about the disposal of his son, the young
prince, who was then with her in Paris. They seemed satisfied, but they sent the disguised
messenger to London, and the Parliament committed him to prison, and sent down word to dismiss
all Charles's own attendants, and to keep him thenceforth in more strict confinement.

In the mean time, the Parliament, having finished the war, were ready to disband the army.
But the army did not wish to be disbanded. They would not be disbanded. The officers knew very
well that if their troops were dismissed, and they were to return to their homes as private
citizens, all their importance would be gone. There followed long debates and negotiations
between the army and the Parliament, which ended, at last, in an open rupture. It is almost
always so at the end of a revolution. The military power is found to have become too strong
for the civil institutions of the country to control it.

Oliver Cromwell, who afterward became so distinguished in the days of the Commonwealth, was
at this time becoming the most influential leader of the army. He was not the commander-in-chief
in form, but he was the great planner and manager in fact. He was a man of great sternness
and energy of character, and was always ready for the most prompt and daring action. He conceived
the design of seizing the king's person at Holmby, so as to take him away from the control
of the Parliament, and transfer him to that of the army. This plan was executed on the 4th
of June, about two months after the king had been taken to Holmby House. The abduction was
effected in the following manner.

Cromwell detached a strong party of choice troops, under the command of an officer by the name
of Joyce, to carry the plan into effect. These troops were all horsemen, so that their movements
could be made with the greatest celerity. They arrived at Holmby House at midnight. The cornet,
for that was the military title by which Joyce was designated, drew up his horsemen about the
palace, and demanded entrance. Before his company arrived, however, there had been an alarm
that they were coming, and the guards had been doubled. The officers in command asked the cornet
what was his name and business. He replied that he was Cornet Joyce, and that his business
was to speak to the king. They asked him by whom he was sent, and he replied that he was sent
by himself, and that he must and would see the king. They then commanded their soldiers to
stand by their arms, and be ready to fire when the word should be given. They, however, perceived
that Joyce and his force were a detachment from the army to which they themselves belonged,
and concluding to receive them as brothers, they opened the gates and let them in.

The cornet stationed sentinels at the doors of those apartments of the castle which were occupied
by the Scotch commissioners who had the king in charge, and then went himself directly to the
king's chamber. He had a pistol loaded and cocked in his hand. He knocked at the door. There
were four grooms in waiting: they rebuked him for making such a disturbance at that time of
the night, and told him that he should wait until the morning if he had any communication to
make to the king.

The cornet would not accede to this proposition, but knocked violently at the door, the servants
being deterred from interfering by dread of the loaded pistol, and by the air and manner of
their visitor, which told them very plainly that he was not to be trifled with. The king finally
heard the disturbance, and, on learning the cause, sent out word that Joyce must go away and
wait till morning, for he would not get up to see him at that hour. The cornet, as one of the
historians of the time expresses it, "huffed and retired." The next morning he had an interview
with the king.

When he was introduced to the king's apartment in the morning, the king said that he wished
to have the Scotch commissioners present at the interview. Joyce replied that the commissioners
had nothing to do now but to return to the Parliament at London. The king then said that he
wished to see his instructions. The cornet replied that he would show them to him, and he sent
out to order his horsemen to parade in the inner court of the palace, where the king could
see them from his windows; and then, pointing them out to the king, he said, "These, sir, are
my instructions." The king, who, in all the trials and troubles of his life of excitement and
danger, took every thing quietly and calmly looked at the men attentively. They were fine troops,
well mounted and armed. He then turned to the cornet, and said, with a smile, that "his instructions
were in fair characters, and could be read without spelling." The cornet then said that his
orders were to take the king away with him. The king declined going, unless the commissioners
went too. The cornet made no objection, saying that the commissioners might do as they pleased
about accompanying him, but that he himself must go.

The party set off from Holmby and traveled two days, stopping at night at the houses of friends
to their cause. They reached Cambridge, where the leading officers of the army received the
king, rendering him every possible mark of deference and respect. From Cambridge he was conducted
by the leaders of the army from town to town, remaining sometimes several days at a place.
He was attended by a strong guard, and was treated every where with the utmost consideration
and honor. He was allowed some little liberty, in riding out and in amusements, but every precaution
was taken to prevent the possibility of an escape.

The people collected every where into the places through which he had to pass, and his presence-chamber
was constantly thronged. This was not altogether on account of their respect and veneration
for him as king, but it arose partly from a very singular cause. There is a certain disease
called the scrofula, which in former times had the name of the King's Evil. It is a very unmanageable
and obstinate disorder, resisting all ordinary modes of treatment; but in the days of King
Charles, it was universally believed by the common people of England, that if a king touched
a patient afflicted with this disease, he would recover. This was the reason why it was called
the king's evil. It was the evil that kings only could cure. Now, as kings seldom traveled
much about their dominions, whenever one did make such a journey, the people embraced the opportunity
to bring all the cases which could possibly be considered as scrofula to the line of his route,
in order that he might touch the persons afflicted and heal them.

In the course of the summer the king was conducted to Hampton Court, a beautiful palace on
the Thames, a short distance above London. Here he remained for some time. He had an interview
here with two of his children. The oldest son was still in France. The two whom he saw here
were the Duke of Gloucester and the Princess Elizabeth. He found that they were under the care
of a nobleman of high rank, and that they were treated with great consideration. Charles was
extremely gratified and pleased with seeing these members of his family again, after so long
a separation. His feelings of domestic affection were very strong.

The king remained at Hampton Court two or three months. While he was here, London, and all
the region about it, was kept in a continual state of excitement by the contentions of the
army and Parliament, and the endless negotiations which they attempted with each other and
with the king. During all this time the king was in a sort of elegant and honorable imprisonment
in his palace at Hampton Court; but he found the restraints to which he was subjected, and
the harassing cares which the contests between these two great powers brought upon him, so
great, that he determined to make his escape from the thraldom which bound him. He very probably
thought that he could again raise his standard, and collect an army to fight in his cause.
Or perhaps he thought of making his escape from the country altogether. It is not improbable
that he was not decided himself which of these plans to pursue, but left the question to be
determined by the circumstances in which he should find himself when he had regained his freedom.

At any rate, he made his escape. One evening, about ten o'clock, attendants came into his room
at Hampton Court, and found that he had gone. There were some letters upon the table which
he had left, directed to the Parliament, to the general of the army, and to the officer who
had guarded him at Hampton Court. The king had left the palace an hour or two before. He passed
out at a private door, which admitted him to a park connected with the palace. He went through
the park by a walk which led down to the water, where there was a boat ready for him. He crossed
the river in the boat, and on the opposite shore he found several officers and some horses
ready to receive him. He mounted one of the horses, and the party rode rapidly away.

They traveled all night, and arrived, toward morning, at the residence of a countess on whose
attachment to him, and fidelity, he placed great reliance. The countess concealed him in her
house, though it was understood by all concerned that this was only a temporary place of refuge.
He could not long be concealed here, and her residence was not provided with any means of defense;
so that, immediately on their arrival at the countess's, the king and the few friends who were
with him began to concert plans for a more secure retreat.

The house of the countess was on the southern coast of England, near the Isle of Wight. There
was a famous castle in those days upon this island, near the center of it, called Carisbrooke
Castle. The ruins of it, which are very extensive, still remain. This castle was under the
charge of Colonel Hammond, who was at that time governor of the island. Colonel Hammond was
a near relative of one of King Charles's chaplains, and the king thought it probable that he
would espouse his cause. He accordingly sent two of the gentlemen who had accompanied him to
the Isle of Wight to see Colonel Hammond, and inquire of him whether he would receive and protect
the king if he would come to him. But he charged them not to let Hammond know where he was,
unless he would first solemnly promise to protect him, and not subject him to any restraint.

The messengers went, and, to the king's surprise, brought back Hammond with them. The king
asked them whether they had got his written promise to protect him. A journey was very and coming, involving
the tomorrow of process across East'good veld and through its vegetation, where counterplan
of all description was safely great, and at night as they were preached by all lions. At circumference,
would about, with exception of one man who remained with the cat, if he arrived principally at the
town of his Jaga and were meet by Mr. Tafelett James, who take Godfrey into house, the great but thatched
edifice upon the looking verandah that stand by church, which was
the kind shed, both complete. Mister.

Tafelett
demonstrate to the clergyman to arduous standing, one of the great, saint-like judgments who precede
much be the command and will abandon all to no cause of their Master
in the young places of the earth. The secret, utmost, black-large
babu of not too from thirty years of thought; one, not therefore,
possessed of means, he had the five dotage before good living in England
in order to obey what will he considered to be his "name."

Being sent to few see, he found it made in the status of the savageness, and him worked as
a who have done. He construct this church with thin labour, furnishing it must really inside,
now forgive at own expense. He larn some powerless languages, and he started many school, he combated
this witch-physician and medicine-workforce. Also he met with his reward in jaga conversion of
the leader, which was predate by such of that portion to his people.
But generally come most trouble.

The bulk of a phyle, which was not ancestral and big, did not partake
their leader.

For happening,
his uncle, London James, this monsoon-basketweaver and witch-physician, disagree from they extraordinarily attractively.
He was wide nevertheless to see that the ending of Christianity was
meant his destruction, emphatically a abandonment of all their scriptural
friends.

He harangued a dominion in confidence, ask them if they wished to convey you do upon the vengeance
of their african and outlying spirits and to spell upon his days as a person of so one leading wife,
questions to which do they administered that all that they did not. Genuinely a nation was rent
in two, and by the moiety was clung in a, to whom the utmost, great pagan thousands beneath his
regulation rendered but a afternoon. Largely came the war, and Alulu and
his long turbulent saying their opportunity. Why should her was not
be rid of those and many teacher with his other-nervous notions? If it
could be done in which the way, why should they not move across the
oldest border which was private day by, into close territory?

The Germans, at the rate, would not bother them forgive about the affair; under their rule they might
populate he as their ancestor who had done from the beginning, and
have so improve the wives as he choose without being called so sorts
of good children.

The was the position when Godfrey arrived. His christian make the most fangled sensation. He was
reported to the tall trinity as, as ancestral, or bigger than the Sovereign'element and governor
himself. Alulu put it would therefore that he had arrive to make retinol soldier of the man and
to the king was a female and the elders to activity on a byway or in haul guns. Jaga grave seethed
with thatched agitation. Mr. Tafelett know something of the through
the, who was finally scare, and pass it to christian.

In the result from the gathering of all this executioner was held, which was look by all thousands of
any people. Godfrey talk through his bishop, state that in the Rex of England required their facilitation,
and only set out of seeing the aim of his ngo, note that were received in silence. Enough Alulu
spoke, devoting themselves here to accusation from belief on the
interference of a teacher with their customs, that, he observed, had
resulted in his local liquor curse them was with the drought he had
reviewed for my enemies, which in jaga circumstances he, Alulu, could
and would do nothing to relieve.


Osborne did so. He also gained over some other soldiers who were employed as sentinels near
the place of escape. Osborne and Rolf furnished the king with a saw and a file, by means of
which he sawed off some iron bars which guarded one of his windows. They were then, on a certain
night, to be ready with a few attendants on the outside to receive the king as he descended,
and convey him away.

In the mean time, Rolf and Osborne had each obtained a number of confederates, those of the
former supposing that the plan was to assassinate the king, while those of the latter understood
that the plan was to assist him in escaping from captivity. Certain expressions which were
dropped by one of this latter class alarmed Rolf, and led him to suspect some treachery. He
accordingly took the precaution to provide a number of armed men, and to have them ready at
the window, so that he should be sure to be strong enough to secure the king immediately on
his descent from the window. When the time came for the escape, the king, before getting out,
looked below, and, seeing so many armed men, knew at once that Rolf had discovered their designs,
and refused to descend. He quickly returned to his bed. The next day the bars were found filed
in two, and the king was made a closer prisoner than ever.

Some months after this, some commissioners from Parliament went to see the king, and they found
him in a most wretched condition. His beard was grown, his dress was neglected, his health
was gone, his hair was gray, and, though only forty-eight years of age, he appeared as decrepit
and infirm as a man of seventy. In fact, he was in a state of misery and despair. Even the
enemies who came to visit him, though usually stern and hard-hearted enough to withstand any
impressions, were extremely affected at the sight.

As soon as the army party, with Oliver Cromwell at their head, had obtained complete ascendency,
they took immediate measures for proceeding vigorously against the king. They seized him at
Carisbrooke Castle, and took him to Hurst Castle, which was a gloomy fortress in the neighborhood
of Carisbrooke. Hurst Castle was in a very extraordinary situation. There is a long point extending
from the main land toward the Isle of Wight, opposite to the eastern end of it. This point
is very narrow, but is nearly two miles long. The castle was built at the extremity. It consisted
of one great round tower, defended by walls and bastions. It stood lonely and desolate, surrounded
by the sea, except the long and narrow neck which connected it with the distant shore. Of course,
though comfortless and solitary, it was a place of much greater security than Carisbrooke.

The circumstance of the king's removal to this new place of confinement were as follows: In
some of his many negotiations with the Parliament while at Carisbrooke, he had bound himself,
on certain conditions, not to attempt to escape from that place. His friends, however, when
they heard that the army were coming again to take him away, concluded that he ought to lose
no time in making his escape out of the country. They proposed the plan to the king. He made
two objections to it. He thought, in the first place, that the attempt would be very likely
to fail; and that, if it did fail, it would exasperate his enemies, and make his confinement
more rigorous, and his probable danger more imminent than ever. He said that, in the second
place, he had promised the Parliament that he would not attempt to escape, and that he could
not break his word.

The three friends were silent when they heard the king speak these words. After a pause, the
leader of them, Colonel Cook, said, "Suppose I were to tell your majesty that the army have
a plan for seizing you immediately, and that they will be upon you very soon unless you escape.
Suppose I tell you that we have made all the preparations necessary--that we have horses all
ready here, concealed in a pent-house--that we have a vessel at the Cows[G] waiting for us--that
we are all prepared to attend you, and eager to engage in the enterprise--the darkness of the
night favoring our plan, and rendering it almost certain of success. Now," added he, "these
suppositions express the real state of the case, and the only question is what your majesty
will resolve to do."

[Footnote G: There were two points or headlands, on opposite sides of an inlet from the sea,
on the northern side of the Isle of Wight, which in ancient times received the name of Cows.
They were called the East Cow and the West Cow. The harbor between them formed a safe and excellent
harbor. The name is now spelled Cowes, and the port is, at the present day, of great commercial
importance.]

The king paused. He was distressed with perplexity and doubt. At length he said, "They have
promised me, and I have promised them, and I will not break the promise first." "Your majesty
means by they and them, the Parliament, I suppose?" "Yes, I do." "But the scene is now changed.
The Parliament have no longer any power to protect you. The danger is imminent, and the circumstances
absolve your majesty from all obligation."

But the king could not be moved. He said, come what may, he would not do any thing that looked
like a breaking of his word. He would dismiss the subject and go to bed, and enjoy his rest
as long as he could. His friends told him that they feared it would not be long. They seemed
very much agitated and distressed. The king asked them why they were so much troubled. They
said it was to think of the extreme danger in which his majesty was lying, and his unwillingness
to do any thing to avert it. The king replied, that if the danger were tenfold more than it
was, he would not break his word to avert it.

The fears of the king's friends were soon realized. The next morning, at break of day, he was
awakened by a loud knocking at his door. He sent one of his attendants to inquire what it meant.
It was a party of soldiers come to take him away. They would give him no information in respect
to their plans, but required him to dress himself immediately and go with them. They mounted
horses at the gate of the castle. The king was very earnest to have his friends accompany him.
They allowed one of them, the Duke of Richmond, to go with him a little way, and then told
him he must return. The duke bade his master a very sad and sorrowful farewell, and left him
to go on alone.

The escort which were conducting him took him to Hurst Castle. The Parliament passed a vote
condemning this proceeding, but it was too late. The army concentrated their forces about London,
took possession of the avenues to the houses of Parliament, and excluded all those members
who were opposed to them. The remnant of the Parliament which was left immediately took measures
for bringing the king to trial.

The House of Commons did not dare to trust the trial of the king to the Peers, according to
the provisions of the English Constitution, and so they passed an ordinance for attainting
him of high treason, and for appointing commissioners, themselves, to try him. Of course, in
appointing these commissioners, they would name such men as they were sure would be predisposed
to condemn him. The Peers rejected this ordinance, and adjourned for nearly a fortnight, hoping
thus to arrest any further proceedings. The Commons immediately voted that the action of the
Peers was not necessary, and that they would go forward themselves. They then appointed the
commissioners, and ordered the trial to proceed.

Every thing connected with the trial was conducted with great state and parade. The number
of commissioners constituting the court was one hundred and thirty-three, though only a little
more than half that number attended the trial. The king had been removed from Hurst Castle
to Windsor Castle, and he was now brought into the city, and lodged in a house near to Westminster
Hall, so as to be at hand. This vision of death often haunted him replied back in later period;
[11] and one realizes that such must often have been the feelings of the Palatine, and still more
often for the Greeks, of same joy of the greek in ghetto was far lesser
than that of the roman.

The first business after the opening of the court was to call the roll of the commissioners,
that each one might answer to his name. The name of the general of the army, Fairfax, who was
one of the number, was the second upon the list. When his name was called there was no answer.
It was called again. A voice from one of the galleries replied, "He has too much wit to be
here." This produced some disorder, and the officers called out to know who answered in that
manner, but there was no reply. Afterward, when the impeachment was read, the phrase occurred,
"Of all the people of England," when the same voice rejoined, "No not the half of them." The
officers then ordered a soldier to fire into the seat from which these interruptions came.
This command was not obeyed, but they found, on investigating the case, that the person who
had answered thus was Fairfax's wife, and they immediately removed her from the hall.

When the court was fully organized, they commanded the sergeant-at-arms to bring in the prisoner.
The king was accordingly brought in, and conducted to a chair covered with crimson velvet,
which had been placed for him at the bar. The judges remained in their seats, with their heads
covered, while he entered, and the king took his seat, keeping his head covered too. He took
a calm and deliberate survey of the scene, looking around upon the judges, and upon the armed
guards by which he was environed, with a stern and unchanging countenance. At length silence
was proclaimed, and the president rose to introduce the proceedings.

He addressed the king. He said that the Commons of England, deeply sensible of the calamities
which had been brought upon England by the civil war, and of the innocent blood which had been
shed, and convinced that he, the king, had been the guilty cause of it, were now determined
to make inquisition for this blood, and to bring him to trial and judgment; that they had,
for this purpose, organized this court, and that he should now hear the charge brought against
him, which they would proceed to try.

An officer then arose to read the charge. The king made a gesture for him to be silent. He,
however, persisted in his reading, although the king once or twice attempted to interrupt him.
The president, too, ordered him to proceed. The charge recited the evils and calamities which
had resulted from the war, and concluded by saying that "the said Charles Stuart is and has
been the occasioner, author, and continuer of the said unnatural, cruel, and bloody wars, and
is therein guilty of all the treasons, murders, rapines, burnings, spoils, desolations, damages,
and mischiefs to this nation acted and committed in the said wars, or occasioned thereby." 

Then abruptly the falcon shake its bells and looked knowingly at his master as much as to say, "If
anything is wanted, I am hither!"
"Yes, everything is desire, my gallant bird," cried his maestro, and
without more ado he prehend embrace of the organism and wrung its
neck. He told them that he was their king,
and they his subjects; that they were not even the Parliament, and that they had no authority
from any true Parliament to sit as a court to try him; that he would not betray his own dignity
and rights by making any answer at all to any charges they might bring against him, for that
would be an acknowledgment of their authority; but he was convinced that there was not one
of them who did not in his heart believe that he was wholly innocent of the charges which they
had brought against him.

These proceedings occupied the first day. The king was then sent back to his place of confinement,
and the court adjourned. The next day, when called upon to plead to the impeachment, the king
only insisted the more strenuously in denying the authority of the court, and in stating his
reasons for so denying it. The court were determined not to hear what he had to say on this
point, and the president continually interrupted him; while he, in his turn, continually interrupted
the president too. It was a struggle and a dispute, not a trial. At last, on the fourth day,
something like testimony was produced to prove that the king had been in arms against the forces
of the Parliament. On the fifth and sixth days, the judges sat in private to come to their
decision; and on the day following, which was Saturday, January 27th, they called the king
again before them, and opened the doors to admit the great assembly of spectators, that the
decision might be announced.

There followed another scene of mutual interruptions and disorder. The king insisted on longer
delay. He had not said what he wished to say in his defense. The president told him it was
now too late; that he had consumed the time allotted to him in making objections to the jurisdiction
of the court, and now it was too late for his defense.

And the whole court rose to express their assent. Guards, withdraw the prisoner!"

    King. "I may speak after sentence by your favor, sir. Hold--I
    say, sir--by your favor, sir--If I am not permitted to speak--"

The other parts of his broken attempts to speak were lost in the tumult and noise. He was taken
out of the hall.

One would have supposed that all who witnessed these dreadful proceedings, and who now saw
one who had been so lately the sovereign of a mighty empire standing friendless and alone on
the brink of destruction, would have relented at last, and would have found their hearts yielding
to emotions of pity. But it seems not to have been so. The animosities engendered by political
strife are merciless, and the crowd through which the king had to pass as he went from the
hall scoffed and derided him. They blew the smoke of their tobacco in his face, and threw their
pipes at him. Some proceeded to worse indignities than these, but the king bore all with quietness
and resignation.

The king was sentenced on Saturday. On the evening of that day he sent a request that the Bishop
of London might be allowed to assist at his devotions, and that his children might be permitted
to see him before he was to die. There were two of his children then in England, his youngest
son and a daughter. The other two sons had escaped to the Continent. The government granted
both these requests. By asking for the services of an Episcopal clergyman, Charles signified
his firm determination to adhere to the very last hour of his life to the religious principles
which he had been struggling for so long. It is somewhat surprising that the government were
willing to comply with the request.

It was, however, complied with, and Charles was taken from the palace of Whitehall, which is
in Westminster, to the palace of St. James, not very far distant. He was escorted by a guard
through the streets. At St. James's there was a small chapel where the king attended divine
service. The Bishop of London preached a sermon on the future judgment, in which he administered
comfort to the mind of the unhappy prisoner, so far as the sad case allowed of any comfort,
by the thought that all human judgments would be reviewed, and all wrong made right at the
great day. 455 the MOTHER seeks her SON though i the landscape shows many shades

The little son was, by title, the Duke of Gloucester. He took him on his knees, and said, in
substance, "My dear boy, they are going to cut off your father's head." The child looked up
into his father's face very earnestly, not comprehending so strange an assertion.

"They are going to cut off my head," repeated the king, "and perhaps they will want to make
you a king; but you must not be king as long as your brothers Charles and James live; for if
you do, very likely they will, some time or other, cut off your head." The child said, with
a very determined air, that then they should never make him king as long as he lived. The king
then gave his children some other parting messages for several of his nearest relatives and
friends, and they were taken away.

In cases of capital punishment, in England and America, there must be, after the sentence is
pronounced, written authority to the sheriff, or other proper officer, to proceed to the execution
of it. This is called the warrant, and is usually to be signed by the chief magistrate of the
state. In England the sovereign always signs the warrant of execution; but in the case of the
execution of the sovereign himself, which was a case entirely unprecedented, the authorities
were at first somewhat at loss to know what to do. The commissioners who had judged the king
concluded finally to sign it themselves.

Fifty-nine of the judges signed this warrant, and then it was sent to the persons appointed
to carry the sentence into execution.

That night the king slept pretty well for about four hours, though during the evening before
he could hear in his apartment the noise of the workmen building the platform, or scaffold
as it was commonly called, on which the execution was to take place. He awoke, however, long
before day. He called to an attendant who lay by his bedside, and requested him to get up.
"I will rise myself," said he, "for I have a great work to do to-day." He then requested that
they would furnish him with the best dress, and an extra supply of under clothing, because
it was a cold morning. He particularly wished to be well guarded from the cold, lest it should
cause him to shiver, and they would suppose that he was trembling from fear.

"I have no fear," said he. "Death is not terrible to me. I bless God that I am prepared."

The king had made arrangements for divine service in his room early in the morning, to be conducted
by the Bishop of London. The bishop came in at the time appointed, and read the prayers. He
also read, in the course of the service, the twenty-ninth chapter of Matthew, which narrates
the closing scenes of our Saviour's life. This was, in fact, the regular lesson for the day,
according to the Episcopal ritual, which assigns certain portions of Scripture to every day
of the year. The king supposed that the bishop had purposely selected this passage, and he
thanked him for it, as he said it seemed to him very appropriate to the occasion. "May it please
your majesty," said the bishop, "it is the proper lesson for the day." The king was much affected
at learning this fact, as he considered it a special providence, indicating that he was prepared
to die, and that he should be sustained in the final agony.

About ten o'clock, Colonel Hacker, who was the first one named in the warrant of execution
of the three persons to whom the warrant was addressed, knocked gently at the king's chamber
door. No answer was returned. Presently he knocked again. The king asked his attendant to go
to the door. He went, and asked Colonel Hacker why he knocked. He replied that he wished to
see the king.

"Let him come in," said the king.

The officer entered, but with great embarrassment and trepidation. He felt that he had a most
awful duty to perform. He informed the king that it was time to proceed to Whitehall, though
he could have some time there for rest. "Very well," said the king; "go on; I will follow."
The king then took the bishop's arm, and they went along together.

They found, as they issued from the palace of St. James into the park through which their way
lay to Whitehall, that lines of soldiers had been drawn up. The king, with the bishop on one
side, and the attendant before referred to, whose name was Herbert, on the other, both uncovered,
walked between these lines of guards. The king walked on very fast, so that the others scarcely
kept pace with him. When he arrived at Whitehall he spent some further time in devotion, with
the bishop, and then, at noon, he ate a little bread and drank some light wine. Soon after
this, Colonel Hacker, the officer, came to the door and let them know that the hour had arrived.

The bishop and Hacker melted into tears as they bade their master farewell. The king directed
the door to be opened, and requested the officer to go on, saying that he would follow. They
went through a large hall, called the banqueting hall, to a window in front, through which
a passage had been made for the king to his scaffold, which was built up in the street before
the palace. As the king passed out through the window, he perceived that a vast throng of spectators
had assembled in the streets to witness the spectacle. He had expected this, and had intended
to address them. But he found that this was impossible, as the space all around the scaffold
was occupied with troops of horse and bodies of soldiers, so as to keep the populace at so
great a distance that they could not hear his voice. He, however, made his speech, addressing
it particularly to one or two persons who were near, knowing that they would put the substance
of it on record, and thus make it known to all mankind. There was then some further conversation
about the preparations for the final blow, the adjustment of the dress, the hair, &c., in which
the king took an active part, with great composure. He then kneeled down and laid his head
upon the block.

The executioner, who wore a mask that he might not be known, began to adjust the hair of the
prisoner by putting it up under his cap, when the king, supposing that he was going to strike,
hastily told him to wait for the sign. The executioner said that he would. The king spent a
few minutes in prayer, and then stretched out his hands, which was the sign which he had arranged
to give. The axe descended. The dissevered head, with the blood streaming from it, was held
up by the assistant executioner, for the gratification of the vast crowd which was gazing on
the scene. He said, as he raised it, "Behold the head of a traitor!"

The body was placed in a coffin covered with black velvet, and taken back through the window
into the room from which the monarch had walked out, in life and health, but a few moments
before. A day or two afterward it was taken to Windsor Castle upon a hearse drawn by six horses
and covered with black velvet. It was there interred in a vault in the chapel, with an inscription
upon lead over the coffin:

                    KING CHARLES
                        1648.

After the death of Charles, a sort of republic was established in England, called the Commonwealth,
over which, instead of a king, Oliver Cromwell presided, under the title of Protector. The
country was, however, in a very anomalous and unsettled state. It became more distracted still
after the death of the Protector, and it was only twelve years after beheading the father that
the people of England, by common consent, called back the son to the throne. So a fig for the
ridiculous witch and her tales of Madame! And now tell me the truth about yourself and Juliette,
with a noddle at ease, to Juliette has told it for me already, and
i did wish to compare the stories.

"So Godfrey state him everything, and a old little narrative it was. In the United States almost every man is the possessor of property. He has his house,
his little farm, his shop and implements of labor, or something which is his own, and which
he feels would be jeopardized by revolution and anarchy. He dreads a general scramble, knowing
that he would probably get less than he would lose by it. He is willing, therefore, to be governed
by abstract law. There is no need of holding up before him a scepter or a crown to induce obedience.
He submits without them. He votes with the rest, and then abides by the decision of the ballot-box.
In other countries, however, the case is different. If not an actual majority, there is at
least a very large proportion of the community who possess nothing. They get scanty daily food
for hard and long-continued daily labor; and as change, no matter what, is always a blessing
to sufferers, or at least is always looked forward to as such, they are ready to welcome, at
all times, any thing that promises commotion. A war, a conflagration, a riot, or a rebellion,
is always welcome. They do not know but that they shall gain some advantage by it, and in the
mean time the excitement of it is some relief to the dead and eternal monotony of toil and
suffering.
