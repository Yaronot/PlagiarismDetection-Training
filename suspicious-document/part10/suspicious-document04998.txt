When the time came for afternoon tea Mr. Greenwood, perceiving that no invitation came to him
from the Marchioness, sent a note up to her asking for the favour of an interview. "He had
a few words to say, and would be much obliged to her if she would allow him to come to her."
On receiving this she pondered for some time before she could make up her mind as to what answer
she should give. She would have been most anxious to do as she had already heard that Lord
Hampstead had done, and decline to meet him at all. She could not analyze her own feelings
about the man, but had come during the last few days to hold him in horror. It was as though
something of the spirit of the murderer had shown itself to her in her eyes. She had talked
glibly, wickedly, horribly of the death of the man who had seemed to stand in her way. She
had certainly wished for it. She had taught herself to think, by some ultra-feminine lack of
logic, that she had really been injured in that her own eldest boy had not been born heir to
his father's titles. She had found it necessary to have some recipient for her griefs. Her
own sister, Lady Persiflage, had given her no comfort, and then she had sought for and had
received encouragement from her husband's chaplain. But in talking of Lord Hampstead's death
she had formed no plan. She had only declared in strong language that if, by the hand of Providence,
such a thing should be done, it would be to her a happy chance. She had spoken out where another
more prudent than she would perhaps only have wished. But this man had taken up her words with
an apparently serious purpose which had frightened her; and then, as though he had been the
recipient of some guilty secret, he had laid aside the respect which had been usual to him,
and had assumed a familiarity of co-partnership which had annoyed and perplexed her. She did
not quite understand it all, but was conscious of a strong desire to be rid of him. But she
did not dare quite as yet to let him know that such was her purpose, and she therefore sent
her maid down to him with a message. "Mr. Greenwood wants to see me," she said to the woman.
"Will you tell him with my compliments that I am not very well, and that I must beg him not
to stay long."

"Lord Hampstead has been a' quarrelling with Mr. Greenwood, my lady,--this very morning," said
the maid.

"Quarrelling, Walker?"

"Yes, my lady. There has been ever so much about it. My lord says as he won't sit down to dinner
with Mr. Greenwood on no account, and Mr. Roberts has been here, all about it. He's to be turned
away."

"Who is to be turned away?"

"Mr. Greenwood, my lady. Lord Hampstead has been about it all the morning. It's for that my
lord the Marquis has sent for him, and nobody's to speak to him till he's packed up everything,
and taken himself right away out of the house."

"Who has told you all that, Walker?" Walker, however, would not betray her informant. She answered
that it was being talked of by everybody down-stairs, and she repeated it now only because
she thought it proper that "my lady" should be informed of what was going on. "My lady" was
not sorry to have received the information even from her maid, as it might assist her in her
conversation with the chaplain.

On this occasion Mr. Greenwood sat down without being asked. "I am sorry to hear that you are
so unwell, Lady Kingsbury."

"I have got one of my usual headaches;--only it's rather worse than usual."

"I have something to say which I am sure you will not be surprised that I should wish to tell
you. I have been grossly insulted by Lord Hampstead."

"What can I do?"

"Well;--something ought to be done."

"I cannot make myself answerable for Lord Hampstead, Mr. Greenwood."

"No; of course not. He is a young man for whom no one would make himself answerable. He is
head-strong, violent, and most uncourteous. He has told me very rudely that I must leave the
house by the end of the month."

"I suppose the Marquis had told him."

"I don't believe it. Of course the Marquis is ill, and I could bear much from him. But I won't
put up with it from Lord Hampstead."

"What can I do?"

"Well;--after what has passed between us, Lady Kingsbury,--" He paused, and looked at her as
he made this appeal. She compressed her lips and collected herself, and prepared for the fight
which she felt was coming. He saw it all, and prepared himself also. "After what has passed
between us, Lady Kingsbury," he said, repeating his words, "I think you ought to be on my side."

"I don't think anything of the kind. I don't know what you mean about sides. If the Marquis
says you're to go, I can't keep you."

"I'll tell you what I've done, Lady Kingsbury. I have refused to stir out of this house till
I've been allowed to discuss the matter with his lordship; and I think you ought to give me
your countenance. I'm sure I've always been true to you. When you have unburdened your troubles
to my ears I have always been sympathetic. When you have told me what a trouble this young
man has been to you, have not I always,--always,--always taken your part against him?" He almost
longed to tell her that he had formed a plan for ridding her altogether of the obnoxious young
man; but he could not find the words in which to do this. "Of course I have felt that I might
depend upon you for assistance and countenance in this house."

"Mr. Greenwood," she said, "I really cannot talk to you about these things. My head is aching
very badly, and I must ask you to go."

"And that is to be all?"

"Don't you hear me tell you that I cannot interfere?" Still he kept that horrid position of
his upon the chair, staring at her with his large, open, lustreless eyes. "Mr. Greenwood, I
must ask you to leave me. As a gentleman you must comply with my request."

"Oh," he said; "very well! Then I am to know that after thirty years' faithful service all
the family has turned against me. I shall take care--" But he paused, remembering that were
he to speak a word too much, he might put in jeopardy the annuity which had been promised him;
and at last he left the room.

Of Mr. Greenwood no one saw anything more that day, nor did Lord Hampstead encounter him again
before he returned to London. Hampstead had arranged to stay at Trafford during the following
day, and then to return to London, again using the night mail train. But on the next morning
a new trouble fell upon him. He received his sister's letter, and learned that George Roden
had been with her at Hendon Hall. He had certainly pledged himself that there should be no
such meeting, and had foolishly renewed this pledge only yesterday. When he read the letter
he was vexed, chiefly with himself. The arguments which she had used as to Roden's coming,
and also those by which she had excused herself for receiving him, did seem to him to be reasonable.
When the man was going on such a journey it was natural that he should wish to see the girl
he loved; and natural that she should wish to see him. And he was well aware that neither of
them had pledged themselves. It was he only who had given a pledge, and that as to the conduct
of others who had refused to support him in it. Now his pledge had been broken, and he felt
himself called upon to tell his father of what had occurred. "After all that I told you yesterday,"
he said, "George Roden and Fanny have met each other." Then he attempted to make the best excuse
he could for this breach of the promise which he had made.

"What's the good?" said the Marquis. "They can't marry each other. I wouldn't give her a shilling
if she were to do such a thing without my sanction." Hampstead knew very well that, in spite
of this, his father had made by his will ample provision for his sister, and that it was very
improbable that any alteration in this respect would be made, let his sister's disobedience
be what it might. But the Marquis seemed hardly to be so much affected as he had expected by
these tidings. "Whatever you do," said the Marquis, "don't let her ladyship know it. She would
be sure to come down to me and say it was all my fault; and then she would tell me what Mr.
Greenwood thought about it." The poor man did not know how little likely it was that she would
ever again throw Mr. Greenwood in his teeth.

Lord Hampstead had not as yet even seen his stepmother, but had thought it no more than decent
to send her word that he would wait upon her before he left the house. All domestic troubles
he knew to be bad. For his stepmother's sake, and for that of his sister and little brothers,
he would avoid as far as might be possible any open rupture. He therefore went to the Marchioness
before he ate his dinner. "My father is much better," he said; but his stepmother only shook
her head, so that there was before him the task of recommencing the conversation. "Dr. Spicer
says so."

"I am not sure that Mr. Spicer knows much about it."

"He thinks so himself."

"He never tells me what he thinks. He hardly tells me anything."

"He is not strong enough for much talking."

"He will talk to Mr. Roberts by the hour together. So I hear that I am to congratulate you."
This she said in a tone which was clearly intended to signify both condemnation and ridicule.

"I am not aware of it," said Hampstead with a smile.

"I suppose it is true about the Quaker lady?"

"I can hardly tell you, not knowing what you may have heard. There can be no room for congratulation,
as the lady has not accepted the offer I have made her." Latter daily have kindly pass her return him remembered

 On that night he went back to London, with a sad feeling at his heart that his journey
down to Trafford had done no good to any one. He had, however, escaped a danger of which he
had known nothing.

CHAPTER XVI.

"I DO."

Lord Hampstead did not reach his house till nearly six on the following morning, and, having
been travelling two nights out of three, allowed himself the indulgence of having his breakfast
in bed. While he was so engaged his sister came to him, very penitent for her fault, but ready
to defend herself should he be too severe to her. "Of course I am very sorry because of what
you had said. But I don't know how I am to help myself. It would have looked so very strange."

"It was unfortunate--that's all."

"Was it so very unfortunate, John?"

"Of course I had to tell them down there."

"Was papa angry?"

"He only said that if you chose to make such a fool of yourself, he would do nothing for you--in
the way of money."

"George does not think of that in the least."

"People must eat, you know."

"Ah; that would make no difference either to him or to me. We must wait, that's all. I do not
think it would make me unhappy to wait till I died, if he only were content to wait also. But
was papa so very angry?"

"He wasn't so very angry,--only angry. I was obliged to tell him; but I said as little to him
as possible because he is ill. Somebody else made herself disagreeable."

"Did you tell her?"

"I was determined to tell her;--so that she should not turn round upon me afterwards and say
that I had deceived her. I had made a promise to my father."

"Oh, John, I am so sorry."

"There is no use in crying after spilt milk. A promise to my father she would of course take
as a promise to her, and it would have been flung in my face."

"She will do so now."

"Oh, yes;--but I can fight the battle better, having told her everything."

"Was she disagreeable?"

"Abominable! She mixed you up with Marion Fay, and really showed more readiness than I gave
her credit for in what she said. Of course she got the better of me. She could call me a liar
and a fool to my face, and I could not retaliate. But there's a row in the house which makes
everything wretched there."

"Another row?"

"You are forgotten in this new row,--and so am I. George Roden and Marion Fay are nothing in
comparison with poor Mr. Greenwood. He has been committing horrible offences, and is to be
turned out. He swears he won't go, and my father is determined he shall. Mr. Roberts has been
called in, and there is a question whether Harris shall not put him on gradually diminished
rations till he be starved into surrender. He's to have £200 a year if he goes, but he says
that it is not enough for him."

"Would it be much?"

"Considering that he likes to have everything of the very best I do not think it would. He
would probably have to go to prison or else hang himself."

"Won't it be rather hard upon him?"

"I think it will. I don't know what it is that makes the governor so hard to him. I begged
and prayed for another hundred a year as though he were the dearest friend I had in the world;
but I couldn't turn the governor an inch. I don't think I ever disliked any one so much in
the world as I do Mr. Greenwood."

"Not Mr. Crocker?" she asked.

"Poor Crocker! I love Crocker, in comparison. There is a delightful pachydermatousness about
Crocker which is almost heroic. But I hate Mr. Greenwood, if it be in my nature to hate any
one. It is not only that he insults me, but he looks at me as though he would take me by the
throat and strangle me if he could. But still I will add the other hundred a year out of my
own pocket, because I think he is being treated hardly. Only I must do it on the sly."

"But Lady Kingsbury is still fond of him?"

"I rather think not. I fancy he has made himself too free with her, and has offended her. However,
there he is shut up all alone, and swearing that he won't stir out of the house till something
better is done for him."

There were two matters now on Lord Hampstead's mind to which he gave his attention, the latter
of which, however, was much the more prominent in his thoughts. He was anxious to take his
sister down to Gorse Hall, and there remain for the rest of the hunting season, making such
short runs up to Holloway as he might from time to time find to be necessary. No man can have
a string of hunters idle through the winter without feeling himself to be guilty of an unpardonable
waste of property. A customer at an eating-house will sometimes be seen to devour the last
fragments of what has been brought to him, because he does not like to abandon that for which
he must pay. So it is with the man who hunts. It is not perhaps that he wants to hunt. There
are other employments in life which would at the moment be more to his taste. It is his conscience
which prompts him,--the feeling that he cannot forgive himself for intolerable extravagance
if he does not use the articles with which he has provided himself. You can neglect your billiard-table,
your books, or even your wine-cellar,--because they eat nothing. But your horses soon eat their
heads off their own shoulders if you pass weeks without getting on their backs. Hampstead had
endeavoured to mitigate for himself this feeling of improvidence by running up and down to
Aylesbury; but the saving in this respect was not sufficient for his conscience, and he was
therefore determined to balance the expenditure of the year by a regular performance of his
duties at Gorse Hall. But the other matter was still more important to him. He must see Marion
Fay before he went into Northamptonshire, and then he would learn how soon he might run up
with the prospect of seeing her again. The distance of Gorse Hall and the duty of hunting would
admit of certain visits to Holloway. "I think I shall go to Gorse Hall to-morrow," he said
to his sister as soon as he had come down from his room.

"All right; I shall be ready. Hendon Hall or Gorse Hall,--or any other Hall, will be the same
to me now." Whereby she probably intended to signify that as George Roden was on his way to
Italy all parts of England were indifferent to her.

"But I am not quite certain," said he.

"What makes the doubt?"

"Holloway, you know, has not been altogether deserted. The sun no doubt has set in Paradise
Row, but the moon remains." At this she could only laugh, while he prepared himself for his
excursion to Holloway.

He had received the Quaker's permission to push his suit with Marion, but he did not flatter
himself that this would avail him much. He felt that there was a strength in Marion which,
as it would have made her strong against her father had she given away her heart without his
sanction, so would it be but little moved by any permission coming from him. And there was
present to the lover's mind a feeling of fear which had been generated by the Quaker's words
as to Marion's health. Till he had heard something of that story of the mother and her little
ones, it had not occurred to him that the girl herself was wanting in any gift of physical
well-being. She was beautiful in his eyes, and he had thought of nothing further. Now an idea
had been put into his head which, though he could hardly realize it, was most painful to him.
He had puzzled himself before. Her manner to him had been so soft, so tender, so almost loving,
that he could not but hope, could hardly not think, that she loved him. That, loving him, she
should persist in refusing him because of her condition of life, seemed to him to be unnatural.
He had, at any rate, been confident that, were there nothing else, he could overcome that objection.
Her heart, if it were really given to him, would not be able to support itself in its opposition
to him upon such a ground of severance as that. He thought that he could talk her out of so
absurd an argument. But in that other argument there might be something that she would cling
to with persistency.

But the Quaker himself had declared that there was nothing in it. "As far as I know," the Quaker
had said, "she is as fit to become a man's wife as any other girl." He surely must have known
had there been any real cause. Girls are so apt to take fancies into their heads, and then
will sometimes become so obstinate in their fancies! In this way Hampstead discussed the matter
with himself, and had been discussing it ever since he had walked up and down Broad Street
with the Quaker. But if she pleaded her health, he had what her own father had said to use
as an argument with which to convince her. If she spoke again of his rank, he thought that
on that matter his love might be strong enough as an argument against her,--or perhaps her own.

He found no trouble in making his way into her presence. She had heard of his visit to King's
Court, and knew that he would come. She had three things which she had to tell him, and she
would tell them all very plainly if all should be necessary. The first was that love must have
nothing to do in this matter,--but only duty. The second, which she feared to be somewhat weak,--which
she almost thought would not of itself have been strong enough,--was that objection as to her
condition in life which she had urged to him before. She declared to herself that it would
be strong enough both for him, and for her, if they would only guide themselves by prudence.
But the third,--that should be a rock to her if it were necessary; a cruel rock on which she
must be shipwrecked, but against which his bark should surely not be dashed to atoms. If he
would not leave her in peace without it she would tell him that she was fit to be no man's wife.

If it came to that, then she must confess her own love. She acknowledged to herself that it
must be so. There could not be between them the tenderness necessary for the telling of such
a tale without love, without acknowledged love. It would be better that it should not be so.
If he would go and leave her to dream of him,--there might be a satisfaction even in that to
sustain her during what was left to her of life. She would struggle that it should be so. But
if his love were too strong, then must he know it all. She had learned from her father something
of what had passed at that interview in the City, and was therefore ready to receive her lover
when he came. "Marion," he said, "you expected me to come to you again?"

"Certainly I did."

"Of course I have come. I have had to go to my father, or I should have been here sooner. You
know that I shall come again and again till you will say a word to me that shall comfort me."

"I knew that you would come again, because you were with father in the City."

"I went to ask his leave,--and I got it."

"It was hardly necessary for you, my lord, to take that trouble."

"But I thought it was. When a man wishes to take a girl away from her own home, and make her
the mistress of his, it is customary that he shall ask for her father's permission."

"It would have been so, had you looked higher,--as you should have done."

"It was so in regard to any girl that I should wish to make my wife. Whatever respect a man
can pay to any woman, that is due to my Marion." She looked at him, and with the glance of
her eye went all the love of her heart. How could she say those words to him, full of reason
and prudence and wisdom, if he spoke to her like this? "Answer me honestly. Do you not know
that if you were the daughter of the proudest lord living in England you would not be held
by me as deserving other usage than that which I think to be your privilege now?"

"I only meant that father could not but feel that you were honouring him."

"I will not speak of honour as between him and me or between me and you. With me and your father
honesty was concerned. He has believed me, and has accepted me as his son-in-law. With us,
Marion, with us two, all alone as we are here together, all in all to each other as I hope
we are to be, only love can be brought in question. Marion, Marion!" Then he threw himself
on his knees before her, and embraced her as she was sitting.

"No, my lord; no; it must not be." But now he had both her hands in his, and was looking into
her face. Now was the time to speak of duty,--and to speak with some strength, if what she
might say was to have any avail.

"It shall not be so, my lord." Then she did regain her hands, and struggled up from the sofa
on to her feet. "I, too, believe in your honesty. I am sure of it, as I am of my own. But you
do not understand me. Think of me as though I were your sister."

"As my sister?"

"What would you have your sister do if a man came to her then, whom she knew that she could
never marry? Would you have her submit to his embrace because she knew him to be honest?"

"Not unless she loved him."

"It would have nothing to do with it, Lord Hampstead."

"Nothing, Marion!"

"Nothing, my lord. You will think that I am giving myself airs if I speak of my duty."

"Your father has allowed me to come."

"I owe him duty, no doubt. Had he bade me never to see you, I hope that that would have sufficed.
But there are other duties than that,--a duty even higher than that."

"What duty, Marion?"

"That which I owe to you. If I had promised to be your wife--"

"Do promise it."

"Had I so promised, should I not then have been bound to think first of your happiness?"

"You would have accomplished it, at any rate."

"Though I cannot be your wife I do not owe it you the less to think of it,--seeing all that
you are willing to do for me,--and I will think of it. I am grateful to you."

"Do you love me?"

"Let me speak, Lord Hampstead. It is not civil in you to interrupt me in that way. I am thoroughly
grateful, and I will not show my gratitude by doing that which I know would ruin you."

"Do you love me?"

"Not if I loved you with all my heart,--" and she spread out her arms as though to assure herself
how she did love him with all her very soul,--"would I for that be brought even to think of
doing the thing that you ask me."

"Marion!"

"No,--no. We are utterly unfit for each other." She had made her first declaration as to duty,
and now she was going on as to that second profession which she intended should be, if possible,
the last. "You are as high as blood and wealth and great friends can make you. I am nothing.
You have called me a lady."

"If God ever made one, you are she."

"He has made me better. He has made me a woman. But others would not call me a lady. I cannot
talk as they do, sit as they do, act as they do,--even think as they do. I know myself, and
I will not presume to make myself the wife of such a man as you." As she said this there came
a flush across her face, and a fire in her eye, and, as though conquered by her own emotion,
she sank again upon the sofa.

"Do you love me, Marion?"

"I do," she said, standing once more erect upon her feet. "There shall be no shadow of a lie
between us. I do love you, Lord Hampstead. I will have nothing to make me blush in my own esteem
when I think of you. How should it be other than that a girl such as I should love such a one
as you when you ask me with words so sweet!"

"Then, Marion, you shall be my own."

"Oh, yes, I must now be yours,--while I am alive. You have so far conquered me." As he attempted
to take her in his arms she retreated from him; but so gently that her very gentleness repressed
him. "If never loving another is to be yours,--if to pray for you night and day as the dearest
one of all, is to be yours,--if to remind myself every hour that all my thoughts are due to
you, if to think of you so that I may console myself with knowing that one so high and so good
has condescended to regard me,--if that is to be yours,--then I am yours; then shall I surely
be yours while I live. But it must be only with my thoughts, only with my prayers, only with
all my heart."

"Marion, Marion!" Now again he was on his knees before her, but hardly touching her.

"It is your fault, Lord Hampstead," she said, trying to smile. "All this is your doing, because
you would not let a poor girl say simply what she had to say."

"Nothing of it shall be true,--except that you love me. That is all that I can remember. That
I will repeat to you daily till you have put your hand in mine, and call yourself my wife."

"That I will never do," she exclaimed, once again standing. "As God hears me now I will never
say it. It would be wrong,--and I will never say it." In thus protesting she put forth her
little hands clenched fast, and then came again the flush across her brow, and her eyes for
a moment seemed to wander, and then, failing in strength to carry her through it all, she fell
back senseless on the sofa.

Lord Hampstead, finding that he alone could do nothing to aid her, was forced to ring the bell,
and to give her over to the care of the woman, who did not cease to pray him to depart. "I
can't do nothing, my lord, while you stand over her that way."

CHAPTER XVII.

AT GORSE HALL.

Hampstead, when he was turned out into Paradise Row, walked once or twice up the street, thinking
what he might best do next, regardless of the eyes at No. 10 and No. 15;--knowing that No.
11 was absent, where alone he could have found assistance had the inhabitant been there. As
far as he could remember he had never seen a woman faint before. The way in which she had fallen
through from his arms on to the sofa when he had tried to sustain her, had been dreadful to
him; and almost more dreadful the idea that the stout old woman with whom he had left her should
be more powerful than he to help her. He walked once or twice up and down, thinking what he
had best now do, while Clara Demijohn was lost in wonder as to what could have happened at
No. 17. It was quite intelligible to her that the lover should come in the father's absence
and be entertained,--for a whole afternoon if it might be so; though she was scandalized by
the audacity of the girl who had required no screen of darkness under the protection of which
her lover's presence might be hidden from the inquiries of neighbours. All that, however, would
have been intelligible. There is so much honour in having a lord to court one that perhaps
it is well to have him seen. But why was the lord walking up and down the street with that
demented air?

It was now four o'clock, and Hampstead had heard the Quaker say that he never left his office
till five. It would take him nearly an hour to come down in an omnibus from the City. Nevertheless
Hampstead could not go till he had spoken to Marion's father. There was the "Duchess of Edinburgh,"
and he could no doubt find shelter there. But to get through two hours at the "Duchess of Edinburgh"
would, he thought, be beyond his powers. To consume the time with walking might be better.
He started off, therefore, and tramped along the road till he came nearly to Finchley, and
then back again. It was dark as he returned, and he fancied that he could wait about without
being perceived. "There he is again," said Clara, who had in the mean time gone over to Mrs.
Duffer. "What can it all mean?"

"It's my belief he's quarrelled with her," said Mrs. Duffer.

"Then he'd never wander about the place in that way. There's old Zachary just come round the
corner. Now we shall see what he does."

"Fainted, has she?" said Zachary, as they walked together up to the house. "I never knew my
girl do that before. Some of them can faint just as they please; but that's not the way with
Marion." Hampstead protested that there had been no affectation on this occasion; that Marion
had been so ill as to frighten him, and that, though he had gone out of the house at the woman's
bidding, he had found it impossible to leave the neighbourhood till he should have learnt something
as to her condition. "Thou shalt hear all I can tell thee, my friend," said the Quaker, as
they entered the house together.

Hampstead was shown into the little parlour, while the Quaker went up to inquire after the
state of his daughter. "No; thou canst not well see her," said he, returning, "as she has taken
herself to her bed. That she should have been excited by what passed between you is no more
than natural. I cannot tell thee now when thou mayst come again; but I will write thee word
from my office to-morrow." Upon this Lord Hampstead would have promised to call himself at
King's Court on the next day, had not the Quaker declared himself in favour of writing rather
than of speaking. The post, he said, was very punctual; and on the next evening his lordship
would certainly receive tidings as to Marion.

"Of course I cannot say what we can do about Gorse Hall till I hear from Mr. Fay," said Hampstead
to his sister when he reached home. "Everything must depend on Marion Fay." That his sister
should have packed all her things in vain seemed to him to be nothing while Marion's health
was in question; but when the Quaker's letter arrived the matter was at once settled. They
would start for Gorse Hall on the following day, the Quaker's letter having been as follows;--

   MY LORD,--

   I trust I may be justified in telling thee that there is
   not much to ail my girl. She was up to-day, and about
   the house before I left her, and assured me with many
   protestations that I need not take any special steps for
   her comfort or recovery. Nor indeed could I see in her
   face anything which could cause me to do so. Of course I
   mentioned thy name to her, and it was natural that the
   colour should come and go over her cheeks as I did so. I
   think she partly told me what had passed between you two,
   but only in part. As to the future, when I spoke of it,
   she told me that there was no need of any arrangement, as
   everything had been said that needed speech. But I guess
   that such is not thy reading of the matter; and that after
   what has passed between thee and me I am bound to offer to
   thee an opportunity of seeing her again shouldst thou wish
   to do so. But this must not be at once. It will certainly
   be better for her and, may be, for thee also that she
   should rest awhile before she be again asked to see thee.
   I would suggest, therefore, that thou shouldst leave
   her to her own thoughts for some weeks to come. If thou
   will'st write to me and name a day some time early in
   March I will endeavour to bring her round so far as to see
   thee when thou comest.

   I am, my lord,
   Thy very faithful friend,

   ZACHARY FAY.

It cannot be said that Lord Hampstead was by any means satisfied with the arrangement which
had been made for him, but he was forced to acknowledge to himself that he could not do better
than accede to it. He could of course write to the Quaker, and write also to Marion; but he
could not well show himself in Paradise Row before the time fixed, unless unexpected circumstances
should arise. He did send three loving words to Marion--"his own, own, dearest Marion," and
sent them under cover to her father, to whom he wrote, saying that he would be guided by the
Quaker's counsels. As, while being please truculent if they surely in their attitude towards the
dissociate principle, but it would be well as Americans would similarly endeavour of actual their
detestation of that principle of their feelings for the hereditary
personnel on the House to Lords.

He was nervous and ill-at-ease, but not thoroughly unhappy. She had told him how dear he was
to her, and he would not have been a man had he not been gratified. And there had been no word
of objection raised on any matter beyond that one absurd objection as to which he thought himself
entitled to demand that his wishes should be allowed to prevail. She had been very determined;
how absolutely determined he was not probably himself aware. She had, however, made him understand
that her conviction was very strong. But this had been as to a point on which he did not doubt
that he was right, and as to which her own father was altogether on his side. After hearing
the strong protestation of her affection he could not think that she would be finally obdurate
when the reasons for her obduracy were so utterly valueless. But still there were vague fears
about her health. Why had she fainted and fallen through his arms? Whence had come that peculiar
brightness of complexion which would have charmed him had it not frightened him? A dim dread
of something that was not intelligible to him pervaded him, and robbed him of a portion of
the triumph which had come to him from her avowal.

      *      *      *      *      *      *

As the days went on at Gorse Hall his triumph became stronger than his fears, and the time
did not pass unpleasantly with him. Young Lord Hautboy came to hunt with him, bringing his
sister Lady Amaldina, and after a few days Vivian found them. The conduct of Lady Frances in
reference to George Roden was no doubt very much blamed, but the disgrace did not loom so large
in the eyes of Lady Persiflage as in those of her sister the Marchioness. Amaldina was, therefore,
suffered to amuse herself, even as the guest of her wicked friend;--even though the host were
himself nearly equally wicked. It suited young Hautboy very well to have free stables for his
horses, and occasionally an extra mount when his own two steeds were insufficient for the necessary
amount of hunting to be performed. Vivian, who had the liberal allowance of a private secretary
to a Cabinet Minister to fall back upon, had three horses of his own. So that among them they
got a great deal of hunting,--in which Lady Amaldina would have taken a conspicuous part had
not Lord Llwddythlw entertained strong opinions as to the expediency of ladies riding to hounds.
"He is so absurdly strict, you know," she said to Lady Frances.

"I think he is quite right," said the other. Unconsciousness they are conscious thoroughly of their
person, of the neighbours all else vanish in the resemblance. Two member
will do commonly be large only of the otherness between them-- the
unlikeness of their features, the instance in their relish or ability,--
hitherto the nature at cognizant hawthorn have health in distinguishing
them do aside.

In all while, Academician in Münsterberg has written in most essay on the affinity to the british
and american peoples as contrasted with his own.
 You know we have settled upon August."

"I had not heard it."

"Oh yes. I nailed him at last. But then I had to get David. You don't know David?"

"No special modern David."

"Our David is not very modern. He is Lord David Powell, and my brother that is to be. I had
to persuade him to do something instead of his brother, and I had to swear that we couldn't
ever be married unless he would consent. I suppose Mr. Roden could get married any day he pleased."
Nevertheless Lady Amaldina was better than nobody to make the hours pass when the men are away
hunting.

But at last there came a grand day, on which the man of business was to come out hunting himself.
Lord Llwddythlw had come into the neighbourhood, and was determined to have a day's pleasure.
Gorse Hall was full, and Hautboy, though his sister was very eager in beseeching him, refused
to give way to his future magnificent brother-in-law. "Do him all the good in the world," said
Hautboy, "to put up at the pot-house. He'll find out all about whiskey and beer and gin, and
know exactly how many beds the landlady makes up." Lord Llwddythlw, therefore, slept at a neighbouring
hotel, and no doubt did turn his spare moments to some profit.

Lord Llwddythlw was a man who had always horses, though he very rarely hunted; who had guns,
though he never fired them; and fishing-rods, though nobody knew where they were. He kept up
a great establishment, regretting nothing in regard to it except the necessity of being sometimes
present at the festivities for which it was used. On the present occasion he had been enticed
into Northamptonshire no doubt with the purpose of laying some first bricks, or opening some
completed institution, or eating some dinner,--on any one of which occasions he would be able
to tell the neighbours something as to the constitution of their country. Then the presence
of his lady-love seemed to make this a fitting occasion for, perhaps, the one day's sport of
the year. He came to Gorse Hall to breakfast, and then rode to the meet along with the open
carriage in which the two ladies were sitting. "Llwddythlw," said his lady-love, "I do hope
you mean to ride."

"Being on horseback, Amy, I shall have no other alternative."

Lady Amaldina turned round to her friend, as though to ask whether she had ever seen such an
absurd creature in her life. "You know what I mean by riding, Llwddythlw," she said.

"I suppose I do. You want me to break my neck."

"Oh, heavens! Indeed I don't."

"Or, perhaps, only to see me in a ditch."

"I can't have that pleasure," she said, "because you won't allow me to hunt."

"I have taken upon myself no such liberty as even to ask you not to do so. I have only suggested
that tumbling into ditches, however salutary it may be for middle-aged gentlemen like myself,
is not a becoming amusement for young ladies."

"Llwddythlw," said Hautboy, coming up to his future brother-in-law, "that's a tidy animal of
yours."

"I don't quite know what tidy means as applied to a horse, my boy; but if it's complimentary,
I am much obliged to you."

"It means that I should like to have the riding of him for the rest of the season."

"But what shall I do for myself if you take my tidy horse?"

"You'll be up in Parliament, or down at Quarter Sessions, or doing your duty somewhere like
a Briton."

"I hope I may do my duty not the less because I intend to keep the tidy horse myself. When
I am quite sure that I shall not want him any more, then I'll let you know."

There was the usual trotting about from covert to covert, and the usual absence of foxes. The
misery of sportsmen on these days is sometimes so great that we wonder that any man, having
experienced the bitterness of hunting disappointment, should ever go out again. On such occasions
the huntsman is declared among private friends to be of no use whatever. The master is an absolute
muff. All honour as to preserving has been banished from the country. The gamekeepers destroy
the foxes. The owners of coverts encourage them. "Things have come to such a pass," says Walker
to Watson, "that I mean to give it up. There's no good keeping horses for this sort of thing."
All this is very sad, and the only consolation comes from the evident delight of those who
take pleasure in trotting about without having to incur the labour and peril of riding to hounds.

At two o'clock on this day the ladies went home, having been driven about as long as the coachmen
had thought it good for their horses. The men of course went on, knowing that they could not
in honour liberate themselves from the toil of the day till the last covert shall have been
drawn at half-past three o'clock. It is certainly true as to hunting that there are so many
hours in which the spirit is vexed by a sense of failure, that the joy when it does come should
be very great to compensate the evils endured. It is not simply that foxes will not dwell in
every spinney, or break as soon as found, or always run when they do break. These are the minor
pangs. But when the fox is found, and will break, and does run, when the scent suffices, and
the hounds do their duty, when the best country which the Shires afford is open to you, when
your best horse is under you, when your nerves are even somewhat above the usual mark,--even
then there is so much of failure! Englishmen have not the regard about the principle to an best
elected quadrennially President if Americans have to a legislative aristocracy; but they do
not well permit than lack of regard of good of a use of growing language at individual Presidents.
Merely that much matter into manners and contemptuous taste, it would, i think, be habitually
as Americans endeavoured of arrive for and express a better understanding of the hereditary work
for the Lords.

In spite of all that was gone this was one of those perfect days to those who had the pleasure
afterwards of remembering it. "Taking it all in all, I think that Lord Llwddythlw had the best
of it from first to last," said Vivian, when they were again talking of it in the drawing-room
after they had come in from their wine.

"To think that you should be such a hero!" said Lady Amaldina, much gratified. "I didn't believe
you would take so much trouble about such a thing."

"It was what Hautboy called the tidiness of the horse."

"By George, yes; I wish you'd lend him to me. I got my brute in between two rails, and it took
me half-an-hour to smash a way through. I never saw anything of it after that." Poor Hautboy
almost cried as he gave this account of his own misfortune.

"You were the only fellow I saw try them after Crasher," said Vivian. "Crasher came on his
head, and I should think he must be there still. I don't know where Hampstead got through."

"I never know where I've been," said Hampstead, who had, in truth, led the way over the double
rails which had so confounded Crasher and had so perplexed Hautboy. But when a man is too forward
to be seen, he is always supposed to be somewhere behind.

Then there was an opinion expressed by Walker that Tolleyboy, the huntsman, had on that special
occasion stuck very well to his hounds, to which Watson gave his cordial assent. Walker and
Watson had both been asked to dinner, and during the day had been heard to express to each
other all that adverse criticism as to the affairs of the hunt in general which appeared a
few lines back. Walker and Watson were very good fellows, popular in the hunt, and of all men
the most unlikely to give it up.

When that run was talked about afterwards, as it often was, it was always admitted that Lord
Llwddythlw had been the hero of the day. But no one ever heard him talk of it. Such a trifle
was altogether beneath his notice.

CHAPTER XVIII.

POOR WALKER.

That famous run took place towards the end of February, at which time Hampstead was counting
all the hours till he should again be allowed to show himself in Paradise Row. He had in the
mean time written one little letter to the Quaker's daughter;--

   DEAREST MARION,--I only write because I cannot keep myself
   quiet without telling you how well I love you. Pray do not
   believe that because I am away I think of you less. I am
   to see you, I hope, on Monday, the 2nd of March. If you
   would write me but one word to say that you will be glad
   to see me!

   Always your own,

   H.

She showed this to her father, and the sly old Quaker told her that it would not be courteous
in her not to send some word of reply. As the young lord, he said, had been permitted by him,
her father, to pay his addresses to her, so much was due to him. Why should his girl lose this
grand match? Why should his daughter not become a happy and a glorious wife, seeing that her
beauty and her grace had entirely won this young lord's heart? "MY LORD," she wrote back to
him,--"I shall be happy to see you when you come, whatever day may suit you. But, alas! I can
only say what I have said.--Yet I am thine, MARION." She had intended not to be tender, and
yet she had thought herself bound to tell him that all that she had said before was true.

It was after this that Lord Llwddythlw distinguished himself, so much so that Walker and Watson
did nothing but talk about him all the next day. "It's those quiet fellows that make the best
finish after all!" said Walker, who had managed to get altogether to the bottom of his horse
during the run, and had hardly seen the end of it quite as a man wishes to see it.

The day but one after this, the last Friday in February, was to be the last of Hampstead's
hunting, at any rate until after his proposed visit to Holloway. On demand water upon every t
there is, of the tribunal, that it should be bad. If one were expecting to be judged yourself by more scholars
infallibly, one might see perhaps hope only been to judgment when them; or it is this sportsmen, undying,
unconscious course, how the brother of intelligent minds, which is somehow formidable lives,--
something more unimpassioned senates and few cajole than courts, something which truly hounds
have all transitory reputations, and at last becomes the justice
or rapidly awards far start.

 No
assurance could have been more perfect, or more devoted. She had coyed him nothing as far as
words are concerned, and he never for a moment doubted but that her full words had come from
a full heart. "But alas! I can only say what I have said." That of course had been intended
to remove all hope. But if she loved him as she said she did, would he not be able to teach
her that everything should be made to give way to love? It was thus that his mind was filled,
as day after day he prepared himself for his hunting, and day after day did his best in keeping
to the hounds.

Then came that last day in February as to which all those around him expressed themselves to
be full of hope. Gimberley Green was certainly the most popular meet in the country, and at
Gimberley Green the hounds were to meet on this occasion. It was known that men were coming
from the Pytchley and the Cottesmore, so that everybody was supposed to be anxious to do his
best. Hautboy was very much on the alert, and had succeeded in borrowing for the occasion Hampstead's
best horse. Even Vivian, who was not given to much outward enthusiasm, had had consultations
with his groom as to which of two he had better ride first. Sometimes there does come a day
on which rivalry seems to be especially keen, when a sense of striving to excel and going ahead
of others seems to instigate minds which are not always ambitious. Watson and Walker were on
this occasion very much exercised, and had in the sweet confidences of close friendship agreed
with themselves that certain heroes who were coming from one of the neighbouring hunts should
not be allowed to carry off the honours of the day.

On this occasion they both breakfasted at Gorse Hall, which was not uncommon with them, as
the hotel,--or pot-house, as Hautboy called it,--was hardly more than a hundred yards distant.
Walker was peculiarly exuberant, and had not been long in the house before he confided to Hautboy
in a whisper their joint intention that "those fellows" were not to be allowed to have it all
their own way. "Suppose you don't find after all, Mr. Walker," said Lady Amaldina, as the gentlemen
got up from breakfast, and loaded themselves with sandwiches, cigar-cases, and sherry-flasks.

"I won't believe anything so horrible," said Walker.

"I should cut the concern," said Watson, "and take to stagging in Surrey." This was supposed
to be the bitterest piece of satire that could be uttered in regard to the halcyon country
in which their operations were carried on.

"Tolleyboy will see to that," said Walker. "We haven't had a blank yet, and I don't think he'll
disgrace himself on such a day as this." Then they all started, in great glee, on their hacks,
their hunters having been already sent on to Gimberley Green.
