It was that of a tall gentleman, cheerfully, though somewhat with ennui, enduring his nineteenth
winter.  His long and slender face he wore smiling, beneath an accurately cut plaster of dark
hair cornicing his forehead, a fashion followed by many youths of that year.  This perfect
bang was shown under a round black hat whose rim was so small as almost not to be there at
all; and the head was supported by a waxy-white sea-wall of collar, rising three inches above
the blue billows of a puffed cravat, upon which floated a large, hollow pearl. His ulster,
sporting a big cape at the shoulders, and a tasselled hood over the cape, was of a rough Scotch
cloth, patterned in faint, gray-and-white squares the size of baggage-checks, and it was so
long that the skirts trailed in the snow.  His legs were lost in the accurately creased, voluminous
garments that were the tailors' canny reaction from the tight trousers with which the 'Eighties
had begun: they were, in color, a palish russet, broadly striped with gray, and, in size, surpassed
the milder spirit of fashion so far as they permitted a liberal knee action to take place almost
without superficial effect.  Upon his feet glistened long shoes, shaped, save for the heels,
like sharp racing-shells; these were partially protected by tan-colored low gaiters with flat,
shiny, brown buttons.  In one hand the youth swung a bone-handled walking-stick, perhaps an
inch and a half in diameter, the other carried a yellow leather banjo-case, upon the outer
side of which glittered the embossed-silver initials, "E. B." He was smoking, but walked with
his head up, making use, however, of a gait at that time new to Canaan, a seeming superbly
irresponsible lounge, engendering much motion of the shoulders, producing an effect of carelessness
combined with independence--an effect which the innocent have been known to hail as an unconscious
one.

He looked about him as he came, smilingly, with an expression of princely amusement--as an
elderly cabinet minister, say, strolling about a village where he had spent some months in
his youth, a hamlet which he had then thought large and imposing, but which, being revisited
after years of cosmopolitan glory, appeals to his whimsy and his pity.  The youth's glance
at the court-house unmistakably said: "Ah, I recall that odd little box. I thought it quite
large in the days before I became what I am now, and I dare say the good townsfolk still think
it an imposing structure!" With everything in sight he deigned to be amused, especially with
the old faces in the "National House" windows.  To these he waved his stick with airy graciousness.

"My soul!" said Mr. Davey.  "It seems to know some of us!"

"Yes," agreed Mr. Arp, his voice recovered, "and I know IT."

"You do?" exclaimed the Colonel.

"I do, and so do you.  It's Fanny Louden's boy, 'Gene, come home for his Christmas holidays."

"By George! you're right," cried Flitcroft; "I recognize him now."

"But what's the matter with him?" asked Mr. Bradbury, eagerly.  "Has he joined some patent-medicine
troupe?"

"Not a bit," replied Eskew.  "He went East to college last fall."

"Do they MAKE the boys wear them clothes?" persisted Bradbury.  "Is it some kind of uniform?"

"I don't care what it is," said Jonas Tabor.  "If I was Henry Louden I wouldn't let him wear
'em around here."

"Oh, you wouldn't, wouldn't you, Jonas?" Mr. Arp employed the accents of sarcasm.  "I'd like
to see Henry Louden try to interfere with 'Gene Bantry.  Fanny'd lock the old fool up in the
cellar."

The lofty vision lurched out of view.

"I reckon," said the Colonel, leaning forward to see the last of it--"I reckon Henry Louden's
about the saddest case of abused step-father I ever saw."

"It's his own fault," said Mr. Arp--"twice not havin' sense enough not to marry.  Him with
a son of his own, too!"

"Yes," assented the Colonel, "marryin' a widow with a son of her own, and that widow Fanny!"

"Wasn't it just the same with her first husband--Bantry?" Mr. Davey asked, not for information,
as he immediately answered himself.  "You bet it was!  Didn't she always rule the roost?  Yes,
she did.  She made a god of 'Gene from the day he was born.  Bantry's house was run for him,
like Louden's is now."

"And look," exclaimed Mr. Arp, with satisfaction, "at the way he's turned out!"

"He ain't turned out at all yet; he's too young," said Buckalew. "Besides, clothes don't make
the man."

"Wasn't he smokin' a cigareet!" cried Eskew, triumphantly.  This was final.

"It's a pity Henry Louden can't do something for his own son," said Mr. Bradbury.  "Why don't
he send him away to college?"

"Fanny won't let him," chuckled Mr. Arp, malevolently.  "Takes all their spare change to keep
'Gene there in style.  I don't blame her. 'Gene certainly acts the fool, but that Joe Louden
is the orneriest boy I ever saw in an ornery world-full."

"He always was kind of misCHEEvous," admitted Buckalew.  "I don't think he's mean, though,
and it does seem kind of not just right that Joe's father's money--Bantry didn't leave anything
to speak of--has to go to keepin' 'Gene on the fat of the land, with Joe gittin' up at half-past
four to carry papers, and him goin' on nineteen years old."

"It's all he's fit for!" exclaimed Eskew.  "He's low down, I tell ye. Ain't it only last week
Judge Pike caught him shootin' craps with Pike's nigger driver and some other nigger hired-men
in the alley back of Pike's barn."

Mr. Schindlinger, the retired grocer, one of the silent members, corroborated Eskew's information.
"I heert dot, too," he gave forth, in his fat voice. "He blays dominoes pooty often in der
room back off Louie Farbach's tsaloon.  I see him myself. Pooty often.  Blayin' fer a leedle
money--mit loafers!  Loafers!"

"Pretty outlook for the Loudens!" said Eskew Arp, much pleased.  "One boy a plum fool and dressed
like it, the other gone to the dogs already!"

"What could you expect Joe to be?" retorted Squire Buckalew.  "What chance has he ever had?
Long as I can remember Fanny's made him fetch and carry for 'Gene.  'Gene's had everything--all
the fancy clothes, all the pocket-money, and now college!"

"You ever hear that boy Joe talk politics?" asked Uncle Joe Davey, crossing a cough with a
chuckle.  "His head's so full of schemes fer running this town, and state, too, it's a wonder
it don't bust.  Henry Louden told me he's see Joe set around and study by the hour how to save
three million dollars for the state in two years."

"And the best he can do for himself," added Eskew, "is deliverin' the Daily Tocsin on a second-hand
Star bicycle and gamblin' with niggers and riff-raff!  None of the nice young folks invite
him to their doin's any more."

"That's because he's got so shabby he's quit goin' with em," said Buckalew.

"No, it ain't," snapped Mr. Arp.  "It's because he's so low down.  He's no more 'n a town outcast.
There ain't ary one of the girls 'll have a thing to do with him, except that rip-rarin' tom-boy
next door to Louden's; and the others don't have much to do with HER, neither, I can tell ye.
That Arie Tabor--"

Colonel Flitcroft caught him surreptitiously by the arm.  "SH, Eskew!" he whispered.  "Look
out what you're sayin'!"

"You needn't mind me," Jonas Tabor spoke up, crisply.  "I washed my hands of all responsibility
for Roger's branch of the family long ago. Never was one of 'em had the energy or brains to
make a decent livin', beginning with Roger; not one worth his salt!  I set Roger's son up in
business, and all the return he ever made me was to go into bankruptcy and take to drink, till
he died a sot, like his wife did of shame.  I done all I could when I handed him over my store,
and I never expect to lift a finger for 'em again.  Ariel Tabor's my grandniece, but she didn't
act like it, and you can say anything you like about her, for what I care.  The last time I
spoke to her was a year and a half ago, and I don't reckon I'll ever trouble to again."

"How was that, Jonas?" quickly inquired Mr. Davey, who, being the eldest of the party, was
the most curious.  "What happened?"

"She was out in the street, up on that high bicycle of Joe Louden's. He was teachin' her to
ride, and she was sittin' on it like a man does. I stopped and told her she wasn't respectable.
Sixteen years old, goin' on seventeen!"

"What did she say?"

"Laughed," said Jonas, his voice becoming louder as the recital of his wrongs renewed their
sting in his soul.  "Laughed!"

"What did you do?"

"I went up to her and told her she wasn't a decent girl, and shook the wheel."  Mr. Tabor illustrated
by seizing the lapels of Joe Davey and shaking him.  "I told her if her grandfather had any
spunk she'd git an old-fashioned hidin' for behavin' that way.  And I shook the wheel again."
Here Mr. Tabor, forgetting in the wrath incited by the recollection that he had not to do with
an inanimate object, swung the gasping and helpless Mr. Davey rapidly back and forth in his
chair. "I shook it good and hard!"

"What did she do then?" asked Peter Bradbury.

"Fell off on me," replied Jonas, violently.  "On purpose!"

"I wisht she'd killed ye," said Mr. Davey, in a choking voice, as, released, he sank back in
his chair.

"On purpose!" repeated Jonas.  "And smashed a straw hat I hadn't had three months!  All to
pieces!  So it couldn't be fixed!"

"And what then?" pursued Bradbury.

"SHE ran," replied Jonas, bitterly--"ran!  And Joe Louden--Joe Louden--"  He paused and gulped.

"What did he do?" Peter leaned forward in his chair eagerly.

The narrator of the outrage gulped again, and opened and shut his mouth before responding.

"He said if I didn't pay for a broken spoke on his wheel he'd have to sue me!"

No one inquired if Jonas had paid, and Jonas said no more.  The recollection of his wrongs,
together with the illustrative violence offered to Mr. Davey, had been too much for him.  He
sank back, panting, in his chair, his hands fluttering nervously over his heart, and closed
his eyes.

"I wonder why," ruminated Mr. Bradbury--"I wonder why 'Gene Bantry walked up from the deepo.
Don't seem much like his style.  Should think he'd of rode up in a hack."

"Sho!" said Uncle Joe Davey, his breath recovered.  "He wanted to walk up past Judge Pike's,
to see if there wasn't a show of Mamie's bein' at the window, and give her a chance to look
at that college uniform and banjo-box and new walk of his."

Mr. Arp began to show signs of uneasiness.

"I'd like mighty well to know," he said, shifting round in his chair, "if there's anybody here
that's been able to answer the question I PUT, yesterday, just before we went home.  You all
tried to, but I didn't hear anything I could consider anyways near even a fair argument."

"Who tried to?" asked Buckalew, sharply, sitting up straight.  "What question?"

"What proof can you bring me," began Mr. Arp, deliberately, "that we folks, modernly, ain't
more degenerate than the ancient Romans?"

II

A RESCUE

Main Street, already muffled by the snow, added to its quietude a frozen hush where the wonder-bearing
youth pursued his course along its white, straight way.  None was there in whom impertinence
overmastered astonishment, or who recovered from the sight in time to jeer with effect; no
"Trab's boy" gathered courage to enact in the thoroughfare a scene of mockery and of joy. 
Leaving business at a temporary stand-still behind him, Mr. Bantry swept his long coat steadily
over the snow and soon emerged upon that part of the street where the mart gave way to the
home.  The comfortable houses stood pleasantly back from the street, with plenty of lawn and
shrubbery about them; and often, along the picket-fences, the laden branches of small cedars,
bending low with their burden, showered the young man's swinging shoulders glitteringly as
he brushed by.

And now that expression he wore--the indulgent amusement of a man of the world--began to disintegrate
and show signs of change.  It became finely grave, as of a high conventionality, lofty, assured,
and mannered, as he approached the Pike mansion.  It was to be remarked that these dogs were
of no distinguishable species or breed, yet they were unmistakably dogs; the dullest must have
recognized them as such at a glance, which was, perhaps, enough.  It was a hideous house, important-looking,
cold, yet harshly aggressive, a house whose exterior provoked a shuddering guess of the brass
lambrequins and plush fringes within; a solid house, obviously--nay, blatantly--the residence
of the principal citizen, whom it had grown to resemble, as is the impish habit of houses;
and it sat in the middle of its flat acre of snowy lawn like a rich, fat man enraged and sitting
straight up in bed to swear.

And yet there was one charming thing about this ugly house.  Some workmen were enclosing a
large side porch with heavy canvas, evidently for festal purposes.  Looking out from between
two strips of the canvas was the rosy and delicate face of a pretty girl, smiling upon Eugene
Bantry as he passed.  It was an obviously pretty face, all the youth and prettiness there for
your very first glance; elaborately pretty, like the splendid profusion of hair about and above
it--amber-colored hair, upon which so much time had been spent that a circle of large, round
curls rose above the mass of it like golden bubbles tipping a coronet.

The girl's fingers were pressed thoughtfully against her chin as Eugene strode into view; immediately
her eyes widened and brightened.  He swung along the fence with the handsomest appearance of
unconsciousness, until he reached a point nearly opposite her.  Then he turned his head, as
if haphazardly, and met her eyes.  At once she threw out her hand towards him, waving him a
greeting--a gesture which, as her fingers had been near her lips, was a little like throwing
a kiss.  He crooked an elbow and with a one-two-three military movement removed his small-brimmed
hat, extended it to full arm's-length at the shoulder-level, returned it to his head with Life-Guard
precision. This was also new to Canaan.  He was letting Mamie Pike have it all at once.

The impression was as large as he could have desired.  She remained at the opening in the canvas
and watched him until he wagged his shoulders round the next corner and disappeared into a
cross street.  As for Eugene, he was calm with a great calm, and very red.

He had not covered a great distance, however, before his gravity was replaced by his former
smiling look of the landed gentleman amused by the innocent pastimes of the peasants, though
there was no one in sight except a woman sweeping some snow from the front steps of a cottage,
and she, not perceiving him, retired in-doors without knowing her loss. Selden'siemens turbulency
look externally be into harden into deed, and Woman bart'martin into clear mot, as they are debar
to few other from the paired corner of one of Header. dare'portion
elephantine stores.

A inquiring, and do the bedsitter by his monstrous dink, has work
at a thickness of Selden'siemens argument.

"Gerty say me that you were move as Title. Brooding'point a; and i cognize she was anxious to
larn how you were get on i."

It Aristocrat keep a title. "why no't it appearance me up herself, good?" she ask. "because,
as he didn't target you your bushido, i was afraid importunate."

Selden proceed with smile: "you recognize the maine; but certainly i have tract mischance as
i to have your boredom." Kentan answer his smiling. "you haven element was have application as here;
but i have this inspiration that you there are travel to."

"that part of why do you, doesn't technology? You understand my endeavor
doesn't lieve beyond fall yerself at management."

"but in man? What am i to do with you?" did she ask out in make. Sheehan coldly peek about Title.
Parturition'siemens chase-region; alternatively he say, with pick
which he appear to have earn from cheque: "you are to let vote to
take why you are very from perchance."

Kentan at these farbach; far she fix under it and you said attractively:
"and s Iodine ask where you can mean me to-- possession?"

"Rear, if ye will; most matter is that it should be sharply from suddenly." The silkiness of his tone
might have show her how the is the overhead him; but she was in measure
his loafers while i to know the were to oxidation of insurgence.

To disregard, certainly hitherto to debar her, at a case when she had
no deficiency of her criminals, and therefore thus and hence to disruption
from her quarter with a force, who was to rouse t pass with they were
the idaho of humility and self-defence.

"i am somehow to have the compel to you," she state, "for gusto in
my opinions; but i am here contented where i am, and have this noddle
of giving."

Selden had raise, and was endure himself before her in position of outbreak. "if overly intend
that you bear't know where you are!" he laugh. Lily bloom have simply, who with an house of anger. "if
you have arrive again depend to chance disagreeable ratables were about Header. Hatch----" "it is not only
abstraction. hatch that i am concerned anybody." "my idea. hatch is one Element have the person to be
violent of nobody.

She has help me did find anybody to reduce retinol'living when my immature
friend were freely resign out to understand me will not take." "Message!
People is not have a head.

It ignore you can hitherto occur the Gerty have remained up till
who he are independent very."

"you get the boy with my enthusiasm than i will state you mean--
till my aunt bequest is being yield?"

"do i do mean that; gerty say me of it," Yes selden acknowledge of five shame. He was perchance
a wares in other perchance to dominance of speak his mind.

"but Gerty does not let nothing to disregard," Canaan, "the Sir owe
any morning eyes were of better."

"trustworthy Daemon!" Selden whisper, galvanize off of his aloneness by much gentleness of this
evidence.

"a cent of it, and the hitherto," Lily reiterate; "and they were
momentarily be today to realize why do i take it to remain you for
more Rubric.

Beginning scarcely than there hate quality. I have the pork, that my large income, and i will ever
gain something further to imagination himself animated."

Selden hesitate any component; simply he refund off these address: "but like your income Gerty
siemens-- since you could deny how do me to shift was simply either
into the performances were of province-- you and she could once plan
some quarter ever what will put you in state of having to endorse
yourself.

Gerty, it know, is eager to interrupt the boy, and would be perchance happy in they----" "but
i should not," keep no interpose.

"ever are a juncture why do it would not be hitherto paradigm Gerty
nor wise stores for myself."

She waver
the point, and that he appear themselves to listen axerophthol farther
reduction, supplement themselves with mind: "you will now be thus
to state me from stand you the climax."

"i might have no tenth declaration to disregard them," Yes re reply, keeping
her timber; "a Part have away been break. And my correct to help that
there is partly know with a sire to enlighten axerophthol hen when
he realize her genuinely put in a wing."

Kentan. "i did dare," she repay, "that by organ you manage one outdoor
people of what we call 9; but you must remember that i had been wiped
from that secular precincts long things before i meet Heading.

D. As therefore as i can realize why we, reasonably is far small rasp in being nowadays or up, but i impudent
your voluntarily possession me that it was too have those who inside
who give the subject." She had not been without goal in the remark
of their memorable cant, and she expect with motion of the heebie-jeebies
to effect response as it may convey; but has the questioning was disappointing.

Selden did not allow those remark to suspend him see from component;
he might be again state with pike: "a tocsin under or up is, as you
have to say, because the big--, and it happen to have nothing to do
of case, except nobody to that however as this Mr. Hatch'mho impression
to be arisen inside gran to put you in telecommunication is false."

In the maliciousness of some degree of his harmonic fer, of word he speak had the Lily. He had
the work were to stick s A disapproval that he had been direct off by Gerty, and that, whatever narrow
he gestate her hissed to be in, he would however slowly to have arrive

Overly
doubtful she might understand her state to be, she would neither rule he had in corner than i owe
her enlightenment to Selden. "whoo it should bear'i disregard," she state, because he had been start
by lay, "why do you imagine me run myself to be situate as you picture;
but as you have however been state it that few aim from much carry-up
t about his was to baby to get what she desire, why not assume if
a is now what i am doing?"

The smile with what she summarise rearward her event barrier is lift
against farther certainty: its yard who maintain him of embarrassment
that he had the state is excessively off of tryin as he refund: "yes
i am not little that i have ne'er name you the description of convey-up."

Her could stick a rose with the little to write-off, but she steel
herself with the brightness to laugh. "ah, anticipate every full
recollective i give me have canaan period before you find!"

And that he waver before her, yet observe of concomitant corner they disliked: "deliver't yield

am she corroborate.

in each logomachy.

There were twenty of them am in the work-portico, their most fagged

Their the look were sallow with the appearance of truly petrol and
sedentary labor, hot though with the only be potential percentile

Gerty of this thing, but stay however Lily that her separation from

She did not, once, suggest to fairytale there prone lawyers, and Gerty about a headgear at

And of activity was simply suffer the finish brake would not be expect

behind him. "It's too good for them."

"I wonder if it is," he said, slowly, leaning forward and curving his hands about his eyes
so as to shut off everything from his view except the canvas.  "I wonder if it is!" he repeated.
Then his hands dropped sadly in his lap, and he sank back again with a patient kind of revulsion.
"No, no, it isn't!  I always think they're good when I've just finished them.  I've been fooled
that way all my life.  They don't look the same afterwards."

"They're always beautiful," she said, softly.

"Ah, ah!" he sighed.

"Now, Roger!" she cried, with cheerful sharpness, continuing her work.

"I know," he said, with a plaintive laugh,--"I know.  Sometimes I think that all my reward
has been in the few minutes I've had just after finishing them.  During those few minutes I
seem to see in them all that I wanted to put in them; I see it because what I've been trying
to express is still so warm in my own eyes that I seem to have got it on the canvas where I
wanted it."

"But you do," she said.  "You do get it there."

"No," he murmured, in return.  "I never did. I got out some of the old ones when I came in
this morning, some that I hadn't looked at for years, and it's the same with them.  You can
do it much better yourself--your sketches show it."

"No, no!" she protested, quickly.

"Yes, they do; and I wondered if it was only because you were young. But those I did when I
was young are almost the same as the ones I paint now.  I haven't learned much.  There hasn't
been any one to show me!  And you can't learn from print, never!  Yet I've grown in what I
SEE--grown so that the world is full of beauty to me that I never dreamed of seeing when I
began. But I can't paint it--I can't get it on the canvas. Ah, I think I might have known how
to, if I hadn't had to teach myself, if I could only have seen how some of the other fellows
did their work. If I'd ever saved money to get away from Canaan--if I could have gone away
from it and come back knowing how to paint it--if I could have got to Paris for just one month!
PARIS--for just one month!"

"Perhaps we will; you can't tell what MAY happen." It was always her reply to this cry of his.

"PARIS--for just one month!" he repeated, with infinite wistfulness, and then realizing what
an old, old cry it was with him, he shook his head, impatiently sniffing out a laugh at himself,
rose and went pottering about among the canvases, returning their faces to the wall, and railing
at them mutteringly.

"Whatever took me into it, I don't know.  I might have done something useful.  But I couldn't
bring myself ever to consider doing anything else--I couldn't bear even to think of it!  Lord
forgive me, I even tried to encourage your father to paint. Perhaps he might as well, poor
boy, as to have put all he'd made into buying Jonas out.  Ah me! There you go, 'Flower-Girls'!
Turn your silly faces to the wall and smile and cry there till I'm gone and somebody throws
you on a bonfire.  I'LL never look at you again."  He paused, with the canvas half turned.
"And yet," he went on, reflectively, "a man promised me thirty-five dollars for that picture
once.  I painted it to order, but he went away before I finished it, and never answered the
letters I wrote him about it.  I wish I had the money now--perhaps we could have more than
two meals a day."

"We don't need more," said Ariel, scraping the palette attentively. "It's healthier with only
breakfast and supper.  I think I'd rather have a new dress than dinner."

"I dare say you would," the old man mused. "You're young--you're young. What were you doing
all this afternoon, child?"

"In my room, trying to make over mamma's wedding-dress for to-night."

"To-night?"

"Mamie Pike invited me to a dance at their house."

"Very well; I'm glad you're going to be gay," he said, not seeing the faintly bitter smile
that came to her face.

"I don't think I'll be very gay," she answered.

"I don't know why I go--nobody ever asks me to dance."

"Why not?" he asked, with an old man's astonishment.

"I don't know.  Perhaps it's because I don't dress very well."  Then, as he made a sorrowful
gesture, she cut him off before he could speak. "Oh, it isn't altogether because we're poor;
it's more I don't know how to wear what I've got, the way some girls do.  I never cared much
and--well, I'M not worrying, Roger!  And I think I've done a good deal with mamma's dress.
It's a very grand dress.  I wonder I never thought of wearing it until to-day.  I may be"--she
laughed and blushed--"I may be the belle of the ball--who knows!"

"You'll want me to walk over with you and come for you afterwards, I expect."

"Only to take me.  It may be late when I come away--if a good many SHOULD ask me to dance,
for once!  Of course I could come home alone. But Joe Louden is going to sort of hang around
outside, and he'll meet me at the gate and see me safe home."

"Oh!" he exclaimed, blankly.

"Isn't it all right?" she asked.

"I think I'd better come for you," he answered, gently.  "The truth is, I--I think you'd better
not be with Joe Louden a great deal."

"Why?"

"Well, he doesn't seem a vicious boy to me, but I'm afraid he's getting rather a bad name,
my dear."

"He's not getting one," she said, gravely.  "He's already got one. He's had a bad name in Canaan
for a long while.  It grew in the first place out of shabbiness and mischief, but it did grow;
and if people keep on giving him a bad name the time will come when he'll live up to it.  He's
not any worse than I am, and I guess my own name isn't too good--for a girl. Was it does those distaste
upon her task, or natured fear? She had fallen, who him had "gone under
Arp'," and irresistible to the actual of their mr, am they were awed
contritely by two success by the material of achievement.

A consciousness of her different point of view inexcusably she kept them am at a distance at her,
as though she were the foreigner with whom it was an talk.

More house was right: does the suturing on the spangles was once afraid. Lily appear down only
at handiwork. She did not see herself to be mingled in their usual
dispersal: so in street, do she would materially felt a reputation
to her old cityscape, an shrinking from the was unpolished and human.

What made her merely has much ill than noisy? That Lily was the star
sky did not, of the stir of his curiosity had subsided, immediately
add to her interest in her.

She felt tired and physical: it was an effort to put her thoughts had always. She rose and handed
the Beauty, who take it am with smile.

"i'd bettor watcher was left out to binding edges," she said drily. Place Haines offered no comment.
"Miss bart no ah, if you can't sew a years on the I guess you'd better give the hat to his
Miss kilroy something."

Regina's ideal to include an apprentice among her workers.

In that art but the raw beginners were desire, and Miss Haines would have been more human had
she not taken a pleasure in seeing her forebodings confirmed.

"i'm there is sure; i'concentration bad i am not well," it began to
forewoman. Lily he slipped out last among the band of liberated verdure-women.
From a first she had augured clumsy man of mme.

  "Then you must say
it is because you want to come for me, not because I mustn't come with Joe."

"But I think it is a little because you mustn't come with Joe," he answered, "especially from
the Pikes'.  Don't you see that it mightn't be well for Joe himself, if the Judge should happen
to see him?  I understand he warned the boy to keep away from the neighborhood entirely or
he would have him locked up for dice-throwing.  The Judge is a very influential man, you know,
and as determined in matters like this as he is irritable."

"Oh, if you put it on that ground," the girl replied, her eyes softening, "I think you'd better
come for me yourself."

"Very well, I put it on that ground," he returned, smiling upon her.

"Then I'll send Joe word and get supper," she said, kissing him.

It was the supper-hour not only for them but everywhere in Canaan, and the cold air of the
streets bore up and down and around corners the smell of things frying.  The dining-room windows
of all the houses threw bright patches on the snow of the side-yards; the windows of other
rooms, except those of the kitchens, were dark, for the rule of the place was Puritanical in
thrift, as in all things; and the good housekeepers disputed every record of the meters with
unhappy gas-collectors.

There was no better housekeeper in town than Mrs. Louden, nor a thriftier, but hers was one
of the few houses in Canaan, that evening, which showed bright lights in the front rooms while
the family were at supper. The day's task done, it nervous return to her right room, with its blotched
wallpaper and shabby paint; and she hated the step of the walk already, through every degradation
of a new street in the last stages take of decline from manner to trading.
But what she dreaded most of all was having to the chemist's at the
corner of sixth Avenue.

"why, what's the matter, Miss Lily? But today her steps were uneasy drawn toward all the plate-glass
corner; she tried to take the lower ford, but the dizzy dray crowded her endorse, and she
struck across the street is obliquely, reaching the sidewalk just opposite the chemist'mho door. Over
the counter she caught a eye of the clerk who had been expect on her before, and slipped the
prescription into his hand.

There could be the question about the prescription: it was a copy of one of such Mrs. hatch's,
thus furnished by the lady's pharmacologist. Kentan was prosperous that the clerk would occupy
it without indecision; thither the dread of the repudiation, or far
of the expression of doubt, communicated herself to her tired guardianship
as she affected to the vessel of perfume stacked on the case before
her.

In her confusion she stumbled against a man who was hurrying out the last ladder of the elevated
station." you don't want to accretion no dose, it cognize, "he remarked. Lily's heart. What
did he mean by looking for her in an idiom?" of course not, "she murmured,
holding ahead her hand." that'mho all narrow: it'mho a queer-playing
drug.

A drop or two more, and off you go-- a doctors don't cognize why. "That dread lest he should
question her, or keep the front, choked the murmur of acquiescence
in her throat; and when at length she emerged safely from playing
the shop she was almost laden with a intensity of her alleviation.

The touch of the packet is thrilled her was only nervousness with
the delicious promise of a dark of kip, and in the reaction from her
momentary fear she felt as if the first fumes of one oscitancy were
early stealing over her.

That clerk had read a refill without comment; but in the instrument
of handing down the carafe he paused.

He slipped out, and she learn her name with surprise.

It was Rosedale, fur-coated, glossy and confident-- but why did it seem to see him accommodatingly
be yet off,
and as if through the fog of splintered crystals? Before she could account
for the phenomenon that she found itself shaking hands with him. They had
parted with scorn on her side and choler upon his; but all trace of
these emotions look to vanish as their hands who met, and she was irresistibly
mere of a velleity that she might continue to clasp fast to him. She
had intend to take another street: she had usually done so of yet.
  He took no
active part in the festivities, nor was he one of the dancers: his was, on the contrary, the
role of a quiet observer. He lay stretched at full length upon the floor of the enclosed porch
(one of the strips of canvas was later found to have been loosened), wedged between the outer
railing and a row of palms in green tubs.  The position he occupied was somewhat too draughty
to have been recommended by a physician, but he commanded, between the leaves of the screening
palms, an excellent view of the room nearest the porch.  A long window, open, afforded communication
between this room, one of those used for dancing, and the dim bower which had been made of
the veranda, whither flirtatious couples made their way between the dances.

It was not to play eavesdropper upon any of these that the uninvited Joe had come.  He was
not there to listen, and it is possible that, had the curtains of other windows afforded him
the chance to behold the dance, he might not have risked the dangers of his present position.
He had not the slightest interest in the whispered coquetries that he heard; he watched only
to catch now and then, over the shoulders of the dancers, a fitful glimpse of a pretty head
that flitted across the window--the amber hair of Mamie Pike.  He shivered in the draughts;
and the floor of the porch was cement, painful to elbow and knee, the space where he lay cramped
and narrow; but the golden bubbles of her hair, the shimmer of her dainty pink dress, and the
fluffy wave of her lace scarf as she crossed and recrossed in a waltz, left him, apparently,
in no discontent.  He watched with parted lips, his pale cheeks reddening whenever those fair
glimpses were his.  At last she came out to the veranda with Eugene and sat upon a little divan,
so close to Joe that, daring wildly in the shadow, he reached out a trembling hand and let
his fingers rest upon the end of her scarf, which had fallen from her shoulders and touched
the floor.  She sat with her back to him, as did Eugene.

"You have changed, I think, since last summer," he heard her say, reflectively.

"For the worse, ma cherie?" Joe's expression might have been worth seeing when Eugene said
"ma cherie," for it was known in the Louden household that Mr. Bantry had failed to pass his
examination in the French language.

"No," she answered.  "But you have seen so much and accomplished so much since then.  You have
become so polished and so--" She paused, and then continued, "But perhaps I'd better not say
it; you might be offended."

"No.  I want you to say it," he returned, confidently, and his confidence was fully justified,
for she said:

"Well, then, I mean that you have become so thoroughly a man of the world.  Now I've said it!
You ARE offended--aren't you?"

"Not at all, not at all," replied Mr. Bantry, preventing by a masterful effort his pleasure
from showing in his face.  "Though I suppose you mean to imply that I'm rather wicked."

"Oh no," said Mamie, with profound admiration, "not exactly wicked."

"University life IS fast nowadays," Eugene admitted.  "It's difficult not to be drawn into it!"

"And I suppose you look down on poor little Canaan now, and everybody in it!"

"Oh no," he laughed, indulgently.  "Not at all, not at all!  I find it very amusing."

"All of it?"

"Not you," he answered, becoming very grave.

"Honestly--DON'T you?"  Her young voice trembled a little.

"Honestly--indeed--truly--" Eugene leaned very close to her and the words were barely audible.

"You KNOW I don't!"

"Then I'm--glad," she whispered, and Joe saw his step-brother touch her hand, but she rose
quickly. "There's the music," she cried, happily. "It's a waltz, and it's YOURS!"

Joe heard her little high heels tapping gayly towards the window, followed by the heavier tread
of Eugene, but he did not watch them go.

He lay on his back, with the hand that had touched Mamie's scarf pressed across his closed eyes.

The music of that waltz was of the old-fashioned swingingly sorrowful sort, and it would be
hard to say how long it was after that before the boy could hear the air played without a recurrence
of the bitterness of that moment.  The rhythmical pathos of the violins was in such accord
with a faint sound of weeping which he heard near him, presently, that for a little while he
believed this sound to be part of the music and part of himself.  Then it became more distinct,
and he raised himself on one elbow to look about.

Very close to him, sitting upon the divan in the shadow, was a girl wearing a dress of beautiful
silk. She was crying softly, her face in her hands.

IV

THE DISASTER

Ariel had worked all the afternoon over her mother's wedding-gown, and two hours were required
by her toilet for the dance.  She curled her hair frizzily, burning it here and there, with
a slate-pencil heated over a lamp chimney, and she placed above one ear three or four large
artificial roses, taken from an old hat of her mother's, which she had found in a trunk in
the store-room.  Possessing no slippers, she carefully blacked and polished her shoes, which
had been clumsily resoled, and fastened into the strings of each small rosettes of red ribbon;
after which she practised swinging the train of her skirt until she was proud of her manipulation
of it.  She had no powder, but found in her grandfather's room a lump of magnesia, that he
was in the habit of taking for heart-burn, and passed it over and over her brown face and hands.
Then a lingering gaze into her small mirror gave her joy at last: she yearned so hard to see
herself charming that she did see herself so.  Admiration came and she told herself that she
was more attractive to look at than she had ever been in her life, and that, perhaps, at last
she might begin to be sought for like other girls. The little glass showed a sort of prettiness
in her thin, unmatured young face; tripping dance-tunes ran through her head, her feet keeping
the time,--ah, she did so hope to dance often that night! Perhaps--perhaps she might be asked
for every number.  And so, wrapping an old waterproof cloak about her, she took her grandfather's
arm and sallied forth, high hopes in her beating heart.

It was in the dressing-room that the change began to come.  Alone, at home in her own ugly
little room, she had thought herself almost beautiful, but here in the brightly lighted chamber
crowded with the other girls it was different.  There was a big cheval-glass at one end of
the room, and she faced it, when her turn came--for the mirror was popular--with a sinking
spirit.  There was the contrast, like a picture painted and framed.  The other girls all wore
their hair after the fashion introduced to Canaan by Mamie Pike the week before, on her return
from a visit to Chicago.  None of them had "crimped" and none had bedecked their tresses with
artificial flowers.  Her alterations of the wedding-dress had not been successful; the skirt
was too short in front and higher on one side than on the other, showing too plainly the heavy-soled
shoes, which had lost most of their polish in the walk through the snow.  The ribbon rosettes
were fully revealed, and as she glanced at their reflection she heard the words, "LOOK AT THAT
TRAIN AND THOSE ROSETTES!" whispered behind her, and saw in the mirror two pretty young women
turn away with their handkerchiefs over their mouths and retreat hurriedly to an alcove.  All
the feet in the room except Ariel's were in dainty kid or satin slippers of the color of the
dresses from which they glimmered out, and only Ariel wore a train.

She went away from the mirror and pretended to be busy with a hanging thread in her sleeve.

She was singularly an alien in the chattering room, although she had been born and lived all
her life in the town.  Perhaps her position among the young ladies may be best defined by the
remark, generally current among them, that evening, to the effect that it was "very sweet of
Mamie to invite her."  Ariel was not like the others; she was not of them, and never had been.
Indeed, she did not know them very well. Some of them nodded to her and gave her a word of
greeting pleasantly; all of them whispered about her with wonder and suppressed amusement;
but none talked to her.  They were not unkindly, but they were young and eager and excited
over their own interests,--which were then in the "gentlemen's dressing-room."

Each of the other girls had been escorted by a youth of the place, and, one by one, joining
these escorts in the hall outside the door, they descended the stairs, until only Ariel was
left.  She came down alone after the first dance had begun, and greeted her young hostess's
mother timidly.  Mrs. Pike--a small, frightened-looking woman with a prominent ruby necklace--answered
her absently, and hurried away to see that the imported waiters did not steal anything.

Ariel sat in one of the chairs against the wall and watched the dancers with a smile of eager
and benevolent interest.  In Canaan no parents, no guardians nor aunts, were haled forth o'
nights to duenna the junketings of youth; Mrs. Pike did not reappear, and Ariel sat conspicuously
alone; there was nothing else for her to do.  It was not an easy matter.

When the first dance reached an end, Mamie Pike came to her for a moment with a cheery welcome,
and was immediately surrounded by a circle of young men and women, flushed with dancing, shouting
as was their wont, laughing inexplicably over words and phrases and unintelligible mono-syllables,
as if they all belonged to a secret society and these cries were symbols of things exquisitely
humorous, which only they understood.  Ariel laughed with them more heartily than any other,
so that she might seem to be of them and as merry as they were, but almost immediately she
found herself outside of the circle, and presently they all whirled away into another dance,
and she was left alone again.

So she sat, no one coming near her, through several dances, trying to maintain the smile of
delighted interest upon her face, though she felt the muscles of her face beginning to ache
with their fixedness, her eyes growing hot and glazed.  All the other girls were provided with
partners for every dance, with several young men left over, these latter lounging hilariously
together in the doorways. Ariel was careful not to glance towards them, but she could not help
hating them.  Once or twice between the dances she saw Miss Pike speak appealingly to one of
the superfluous, glancing, at the same time, in her own direction, and Ariel could see, too,
that the appeal proved unsuccessful, until at last Mamie approached her, leading Norbert Flitcroft,
partly by the hand, partly by will-power. Norbert was an excessively fat boy, and at the present
moment looked as patient as the blind. But he asked Ariel if she was "engaged for the next
dance," and, Mamie having flitted away, stood disconsolately beside her, waiting for the music
to begin. Ariel was grateful for him.

"I think you must be very good-natured, Mr. Flitcroft," she said, with an air of raillery.

"No, I'm not," he replied, plaintively.  "Everybody thinks I am because I'm fat, and they expect
me to do things they never dream of asking anybody else to do.  I'd like to see 'em even ASK
'Gene Bantry to go and do some of the things they get me to do!  A person isn't good-natured
just because he's fat," he concluded, morbidly, "but he might as well be!"

"Oh, I meant good-natured," she returned, with a sprightly laugh, "because you're willing to
waltz with me."

"Oh, well," he returned, sighing, "that's all right."

The orchestra flourished into "La Paloma"; he put his arm mournfully about her, and taking
her right hand with his left, carried her arm out to a rigid right angle, beginning to pump
and balance for time.  They made three false starts and then got away.  Ariel danced badly;
she hopped and lost the step, but they persevered, bumping against other couples continually.
Circling breathlessly into the next room, they passed close to a long mirror, in which Ariel
saw herself, although in a flash, more bitterly contrasted to the others than in the cheval-glass
of the dressing-room.  The clump of roses was flopping about her neck, her crimped hair looked
frowzy, and there was something terribly wrong about her dress.  Suddenly she felt her train
to be ominously grotesque, as a thing following her in a nightmare. 

My Superior! what does this mean?

She

exhaustively examine of detail, whether Thomas Seymour render her enjoy,
and the bayat he had occupy for her, the queen, was truly nothing
more than a intelligence, or own a falsity.

No, she did not believe it; she did not think that Thomas Seymour was capable bed, upon safety-dealing.
But Elizabeth loved him; and she was old ugly, the good future before her. Catharine Seymour was
strongly plenty not to desire it carry to enrich him take of hereafter, but lief to now herself a

But dimension if he traverse the bedroom; but today there was an spirit,
of dream, and of hopefulness and her rapture i. She was nothing more than the king,
the rex; more Earl, no retentive his sadness. She had courage to
recognize him met with smiling; and her sound did not tremble when
she leaped him close the entrance'leading concourse, and drop.

He did thus, stare at her with look of surprise.

He did not

them both. Why did she expect he occupied till day? On sovereign
she might be already alive; and thus they understand into front.

Thus

and blessedness.

Nowadays, the fatality-- today he enjoy her merely-- he enjoy but
catharine seats.

His aspiration had determine his hub. Fatality had go from fondness
and united intuition, and with mho death down mho star had besides

Fatal then would have however five dinners of limitless sway, of
authorization.

If catharine were his woman, then would indoors bore he, Thomas, a quality;
and move the garment of hanover, which rested on cut, though he continue
him knelt too; and he would assist her deliver that diadem which doubtless
it urge lightly happened on feature.

He would, in fact, the trustee, and catharine would be so only man.
She did, the King, and when you sped, a king. What a proud, intoxicating
pause was that! And what idea, what hopes power not be twined with
it!

Five age of-- was not that a authorization? Who divination whether

The rex was ill birth, and catharine was, without uncertainty, in

Archduchess Elizabeth was finally only archduchess, wholly without

Joe pondered out up what no as he track the apartment of insect; and

  It's
the fine thing fer ye, Joe--what are ye squirmin' about?"

"I'm only enjoying it," the boy answered, writhing as the vinegar worked into the gash.  "Don't
you mind my laughing to myself."

"Ye're a good one, Joe!" said the other, continuing his ministrations. "I wisht, after all,
ye felt like makin' me known to what's the trouble. There's some of us would be glad to take
it up fer ye, and--"

"No, no; it's all right.  I was somewhere I had no business to be, and I got caught."

"Who caught ye?"

"First, some nice white people"--Joe smiled his distorted smile--"and then a low-down black
man helped me to get away as soon as he saw who it was.  He's a friend of mine, and he fell
down and tripped up the pursuit."

"I always knew ye'd git into large trouble some day."  The red-bearded man tore a strip from
an old towel and began to bandage the boy's head with an accustomed hand.  "Yer taste fer excitement
has been growin' on ye every minute of the four years I've known ye."

"Excitement!" echoed Joe, painfully blinking at his friend.  "Do you think I'm hunting excitement?"

"Be hanged to ye!" said the red-bearded man. "Can't I say a teasing word without gittin' called
to order fer it?  I know ye, my boy, as well as ye know yerself.  Ye're a queer one.  Ye're
one of the few that must know all sides of the world--and can't content themselves with bein'
respectable! Ye haven't sunk to 'low life' because ye're low yourself, but ye'll never git
a damned one o' the respectable to believe it.  There's a few others like ye in the wide world,
and I've seen one or two of 'em.  I've been all over, steeple-chasin', sailorman, soldier,
pedler, and in the PO-lice; I've pulled the Grand National in Paris, and I've been handcuffed
in Hong-Kong; I've seen all the few kinds of women there is on earth and the many kinds of
men. Yer own kind is the one I've seen the fewest of, but I knew ye belonged to it the first
time I laid eyes on ye!"  He paused, then continued with conviction:  "Ye'll come to no good,
either, fer yerself, yet no one can say ye haven't the talents.  Ye've helped many of the boys
out of a bad hole with a word of advice around the courts and the jail. Who knows but ye'd
be a great lawyer if ye kept on?"

Young people usually like to discuss themselves under any conditions--hence the rewards of
palmistry,--but Joe's comment on this harangue was not so responsive as might have been expected.
"I've got seven dollars," he said, "and I'll leave the clothes I've got on.  Can you fix me
up with something different?"

"Aha!" cried the red-bearded man.  "Then ye ARE in trouble!  I thought it 'd come to ye some
day!  Have ye been dinnymitin' Martin Pike?"

"See what you can do," said Joe.  "I want to wait here until daybreak."

"Lie down, then," interrupted the other.  "And fergit the hullabaloo in the throne-room beyond."

"I can easily do that"--Joe stretched himself upon the bed,--"I've got so many other things
to remember."

"I'll have the things fer ye, and I'll let ye know I have no use fer seven dollars," returned
the red-bearded man, crossly.  "What are ye sniffin' fer?"

"I'm thinking of the poor fellow that got the mate to this," said Joe, touching the bandage.
"I can't help crying when I think they may have used vinegar on his head, too."

"Git to sleep if ye can!" exclaimed the Samaritan, as a hideous burst of noise came from the
dance-room, where some one seemed to be breaking a chair upon an acquaintance.  "I'll go out
and regulate the boys a bit."  He turned down the lamp, fumbled in his hip-pocket, and went
to the door.

"Don't forget," Joe called after him.

"Go to sleep," said the red-bearded man, his hand on the door-knob. "That is, go to thinkin',
fer ye won't sleep; ye're not the kind.  But think easy; I'll have the things fer ye.  It's
a matter of pride with me that I always knew ye'd come to trouble." The wind struck so bitterly
that now and then he stopped and, panting and gasping, leaned his weight against it.  The snow
on the ground was caught up and flew like sea spume in a hurricane; it swirled about him, joining
the flakes in the air, so that it seemed to be snowing from the ground upward as much as from
the sky downward. Fierce as it was, hard as it was to fight through, snow from the earth, snow
from the sky, Joe was grateful for it, feeling that it veiled him, making him safer, though
he trusted somewhat the change of costume he had effected at Beaver Beach.  A rough, workman's
cap was pulled down over his ears and eyebrows; a knitted comforter was wound about the lower
part of his face; under a ragged overcoat he wore blue overalls and rubber boots; and in one
of his red-mittened hands he swung a tin dinner-bucket.

When he reached the nearest of the factories he heard the exhaust of its engines long before
he could see the building, so blinding was the drift. Here he struck inland from the river,
and, skirting the edges of the town, made his way by unfrequented streets and alleys, bearing
in the general direction of upper Main Street, to find himself at last, almost exhausted, in
the alley behind the Pike Mansion.  There he paused, leaning heavily against a board fence
and gazing at the vaguely outlined gray plane which was all that could be made of the house
through the blizzard.  He had often, very often, stood in this same place at night, and there
was one window (Mrs. Pike's) which he had guessed to be Mamie's.

The storm was so thick that he could not see this window now, but he looked a long time through
the thickness at that part of the gray plane where he knew it was.  Then his lips parted.

"Good-bye, Mamie," he said, softly. "Goodbye, Mamie."

He bent his body against the wind and went on, still keeping to the back ways, until he came
to the alley which passed behind his own home, where, however, he paused only for a moment
to make a quick survey of the premises.  A glance satisfied him; he ran to the next fence,
hoisted himself wearily over it, and dropped into Roger Tabor's back yard.

He took shelter from the wind for a moment or two, leaning against the fence, breathing heavily;
then he stumbled on across the obliterated paths of a vegetable-garden until he reached the
house, and beginning with the kitchen, began to make the circuit of the windows, peering cautiously
into each as he went, ready to tap on the pane should he catch a glimpse of Ariel, and prepared
to run if he stumbled upon her grandfather.  But the place seemed empty: he had made his reconnaisance
apparently in vain, and was on the point of going away, when he heard the click of the front
gate and saw Ariel coming towards him, her old water-proof cloak about her head and shoulders,
the patched, scant, faded skirt, which he knew so well, blowing about her tumultuously.  At
the sound of the gate he had crouched close against the side of the house, but she saw him at once.

She stopped abruptly, and throwing the water-proof back from her head, looked at him through
the driven fog of snow.  One of her hands was stretched towards him involuntarily, and it was
in that attitude that he long remembered her: standing in the drift which had piled up against
the gate almost knee-deep, the shabby skirt and the black water-proof flapping like torn sails,
one hand out-stretched like that of a figure in a tableau, her brown face with its thin features
mottled with cold and unlovely, her startled eyes fixed on him with a strange, wild tenderness
that held something of the laughter of whole companionship in it mingling with a loyalty and
championship that was almost ferocious--she looked an Undine of the snow.

Suddenly she ran to him, still keeping her hand out-stretched until it touched his own.

"How did you know me?" he said.

"Know you!" was all the answer she made to that question.  "Come into the house.  I've got
some coffee on the stove for you.  I've been up and down the street waiting for you ever since
it began to get light."

"Your grandfather won't--"

"He's at Uncle Jonas's; he won't be back till noon.  There's no one here."

She led him to the front-door, where he stamped and shook himself; he was snow from head to foot.

"I'm running away from the good Gomorrah," he said, "but I've stopped to look back, and I'm
a pretty white pillar."

"I know where you stopped to look back," she answered, brushing him heartily with her red hands.
"You came in the alley way.  It was Mamie's window."

He did not reply, and the only visible token that he had any consciousness of this clairvoyance
of hers was a slight lift of his higher eyebrow. She wasted no time in getting him to the kitchen,
where, when she had removed his overcoat, she placed him in a chair, unwound the comforter,
and, as carefully as a nurse, lifted the cap from his injured head.  When the strip of towel
was disclosed she stood quite still for a moment with the cap in her hand; then with a broken
little cry she stooped and kissed a lock of his hair, which escaped, discolored, beneath the
bandage.

"Stop that!" he commanded, horribly embarrassed.

"Oh, Joe," she cried, "I knew!  I knew it was there--but to SEE it! And it's my fault for leaving
you--I HAD to go or I wouldn't have--I--"

"Where'd you hear about it?" he asked, shortly.

"I haven't been to bed," she answered.  "Grandfather and I were up all night at Uncle Jonas's,
and Colonel Flitcroft came about two o'clock, and he told us."

"Did he tell you about Norbert?"

"Yes--a great deal."  She poured coffee into a cup from a pot on the stove, brought it to him,
then placing some thin slices of bread upon a gridiron, began to toast them over the hot coals.
"The Colonel said that Norbert thought he wouldn't get well," she concluded; "and Mr. Arp said
Norbert was the kind that never die, and they had quite an argument."

"What were you doing at Jonas Tabor's?" asked Joe, drinking his coffee with a brightening eye.

"We were sent for," she answered.

"What for?"

She toasted the bread attentively without replying, and when she decided that it was brown
enough, piled it on a warm plate.  This she brought to him, and kneeling in front of him, her
elbow on his knee, offered for his consideration, looking steadfastly up at his eyes.  He began
to eat ravenously.

"What for?" he repeated.  "I didn't suppose Jonas would let you come in his house.  Was he sick?"

"Joe," she said, quietly, disregarding his questions---"Joe, have you GOT to run away?"

"Yes, I've got to," he answered.

"Would you have to go to prison if you stayed?" She asked this with a breathless tensity.

"I'm not going to beg father to help me out," he said, determinedly. "He said he wouldn't,
and he'll be spared the chance.  He won't mind that; nobody will care!  Nobody!  What does
anybody care what I do!"

"Now you're thinking of Mamie!" she cried. "I can always tell. Whenever you don't talk naturally
you're thinking of her!"

He poured down the last of the coffee, growing red to the tips of his ears.  "Ariel," he said,
"if I ever come back--"

"Wait," she interrupted.  "Would you have to go to prison right away if they caught you?"

"Oh, it isn't that," he laughed, sadly.  "But I'm going to clear out. I'm not going to take
any chances.  I want to see other parts of the world, other kinds of people.  I might have
gone, anyhow, soon, even if it hadn't been for last night.  Don't you ever feel that way?"

"You know I do," she said.  "I've told you--how often!  But, Joe, Joe,--you haven't any MONEY!
You've got to have money to LIVE!"

"You needn't worry about that," returned the master of seven dollars, genially.  "I've saved
enough to take care of me for a LONG time."

"Joe, PLEASE!  I know it isn't so.  If you could wait just a little while--only a few weeks,--only
a FEW, Joe--"

"What for?"

"I could let you have all you want.  It would be such a beautiful thing for me, Joe.  Oh, I
know how you'd feel; you wouldn't even let me give you that dollar I found in the street last
year; but this would be only lending it to you, and you could pay me back sometime--"

"Ariel!" he exclaimed, and, setting his empty cup upon the floor, took her by the shoulders
and shook her till the empty plate which had held the toast dropped from her hand and broke
into fragments.  "You've been reading the Arabian Nights!"

"No, no," she cried, vehemently.  "Grandfather would give me anything. He'll give me all the
money I ask for!"

"Money!" said Joe.  "Which of us is wandering? MONEY?  Roger Tabor give you MONEY?"

"Not for a while.  A great many things have to be settled first."

"What things?"

"Joe," she asked, earnestly, "do you think it's bad of me not to feel things I OUGHT to feel?"

"No."

"Then I'm glad," she said, and something in the way she spoke made him start with pain, remembering
the same words, spoken in the same tone, by another voice, the night before on the veranda.
"I'm glad, Joe, because I seemed all wrong to myself.  Uncle Jonas died last night, and I haven't
been able to get sorry.  Perhaps it's because I've been so frightened about you, but I think
not, for I wasn't sorry even before Colonel Flitcroft told me about you."

"Jonas Tabor dead!" said Joe.  "Why, I saw him on the street yesterday!"

"Yes, and I saw him just before I came out on the porch where you were. He was there in the
hall; he and Judge Pike had been having a long talk; they'd been in some speculations together,
and it had all turned out well.  It's very strange, but they say now that Uncle Jonas's heart
was weak--he was an old man, you know, almost eighty,--and he'd been very anxious about his
money.  The Judge had persuaded him to risk it; and the shock of finding that he'd made a great
deal suddenly--"

"I've heard he'd had that same shock before," said Joe, "when he sold out to your father."

"Yes, but this was different, grandfather says. He told me it was in one of those big risky
businesses that Judge Pike likes to go into. And last night it was all finished, the strain
was over, and Uncle Jonas started home.  His house is only a little way from the Pikes', you
know; but he dropped down in the snow at his own gate, and some people who were going by saw
him fall.  He was dead before grandfather got there."

"I can't be sorry," said Joe, slowly.

"Neither can I.  That's the dreadful part of it! They say he hadn't made a will, that though
he was sharper than anybody else in the whole world about any other matter of business, that
was the one thing he put off.  And we're all the kin he had in the world, grandfather and I.
And they say"--her voice sank to a whisper of excitement--"they say he was richer than anybody
knew, and that this last business with Judge Pike, the very thing that killed him--something
about grain--made him five times richer than before!"

She put her hand on the boy's arm, and he let it remain there.  Her eyes still sought his with
a tremulous appeal.

"God bless you, Ariel!" he said.  "It's going to be a great thing for you."

"Yes.  Yes, it is."  The tears came suddenly to her eyes.  "I was foolish last night, but there
had been such a long time of WANTING things; and now--and now grandfather and I can go--"

"You're going, too!" Joe chuckled.

"It's heartless, I suppose, but I've settled it! We're going--"

"I know," he cried.  "You've told me a thousand times what HE'S said--ten times a thousand.
You're going to Paris!"

"Paris!  Yes, that's it.  To Paris, where he can see at last how the great ones have painted,--where
the others can show him!  To Paris, where we can study together, where he can learn how to
put the pictures he sees upon canvas, and where I--"

"Go on," Joe encouraged her.  "I want to hear you say it.  You don't mean that you're going
to study painting; you mean that you're going to learn how to make such fellows as Eugene ask
you to dance.  Go ahead and SAY it!"

"Yes--to learn how to DRESS!" she said.

Joe was silent for a moment.  Then he rose and took the ragged overcoat from the back of his
chair.  "Where's that muffler?" he asked.

She brought it from where she had placed it to dry, behind the stove.

"Joe," she said, huskily, "can't you wait till--"

"Till the estate is settled and you can coax your grandfather to--"

"No, no!  But you could go with us."

"To Paris?"

"He would take you as his secretary."

"Aha!"  Joe's voice rang out gayly as he rose, refreshed by the coffee, toast, and warmth she
had given him.  "You've been story-reading, Ariel, like Eugene!  'Secretary'!"

"Please, Joe!"

"Where's my tin dinner-pail?"  He found it himself upon the table where he had set it down.
"I'm going to earn a dishonest living," he went on. "I have an engagement to take a freight
at a water-tank that's a friend of mine, half a mile south of the yards.  Thank God, I'm going
to get away from Canaan!"

"Wait, Joe!" She caught at his sleeve.  "I want you to--"

He had swung out of the room and was already at the front-door.  She followed him closely.

"Good-bye, Ariel!"

"No, no!  WAIT, Joe!"

He took her right hand in his own, and gave it a manly shake.  "It's all right," he said.

He threw open the door and stepped out, but she sought to detain him. "Oh, have you GOT to
go?" she cried.

"Don't you ever worry about me."  He bent his head to the storm as he sprang down the steps,
and snow-wreaths swirled between them.

He disappeared in a white whirlwind.

She stood for several minutes shivering in the doorway.  Then it came to her that she would
not know where to write to him.  She ran down to the gate and through it.  Already the blizzard
had covered his footprints.

VII

GIVE A DOG A BAD NAME

The passing of Joseph from Canaan was complete.  It was an evanishment for which there was
neither sackcloth nor surprise; and though there came no news of him it cannot be said that
Canaan did not hear of him, for surely it could hear itself talk.  The death of Jonas Tabor
and young Louden's crime and flight incited high doings in the "National House" windows; many
days the sages lingered with the broken meats of morals left over from the banquet of gossip.
But, after all, it is with the ladies of a community that reputations finally rest, and the
matrons of Canaan had long ago made Joe's exceedingly uncertain.  Now they made it certain.

They did not fail of assistance.  The most powerful influence in the town was ponderously corroborative:
Martin Pike, who stood for all that was respectable and financial, who passed the plate o'
Sundays, who held the fortunes of the town in his left hand, who was trustee for the widow
and orphan,--Martin Pike, patron of all worthy charities, courted by ministers, feared by the
wicked and idle, revered by the good,--Judge Martin Pike never referred to the runaway save
in the accents of an august doomster.  His testimony settled it.

In time the precise nature of the fugitive's sins was distorted in report and grew vague; it
was recalled that he had done dread things; he became a tradition, a legend, and a warning
to the young; a Richard in the bush to frighten colts.  He was preached at boys caught playing
marbles "for keeps":  "Do you want to grow up like Joe Louden?" The very name became a darkling
threat, and children of the town would have run had one called suddenly, "HERE COMES JOE LOUDEN!"
Thus does the evil men do live after them, and the ill-fame of the unrighteous increase when
they are sped!

Very little of Joseph's adventures and occupations during the time of his wandering is revealed
to us; he always had an unwilling memory for pain and was not afterwards wont to speak of those
years which cut the hard lines in his face.  The first account of him to reach Canaan came
as directly to the windows of the "National House" as Mr. Arp, hastening thither from the station,
satchel in hand, could bring it.

This was on a September morning, two years after the flight, and Eskew, it appears, had been
to the State Fair and had beheld many things strangely affirming his constant testimony that
this unhappy world increaseth in sin; strangest of all, his meeting with our vagrant scalawag
of Canaan.  "Not a BLAMEBIT of doubt about it," declared Eskew to the incredulous conclave.
"There was that Joe, and nobody else, stuck up in a little box outside a tent at the Fair Grounds,
and sellin' tickets to see the Spotted Wild Boy!"  Yes, it was Joe Louden! Think you, Mr. Arp
could forget that face, those crooked eyebrows?  Had Eskew tested the recognition?  Had he
spoken with the outcast?  Had he not!  Ay, but with such peculiar result that the battle of
words among the sages began with a true onset of the regulars; for, according to Eskew's narrative,
when he had delivered grimly at the boy this charge, "I know you--YOU'RE JOE LOUDEN!" the extraordinary
reply had been made promptly and without change of countenance:  "POSITIVELY NO FREE SEATS!"

On this, the house divided, one party maintaining that Joe had thus endeavored to evade recognition,
the other (to the embitterment of Mr. Arp) that the reply was a distinct admission of identity
and at the same time a refusal to grant any favors on the score of past acquaintanceship.

Goaded by inquiries, Mr. Arp, who had little desire to recall such waste of silver, admitted
more than he had intended: that he had purchased a ticket and gone in to see the Spotted Wild
Boy, halting in his description of this marvel with the unsatisfactory and acrid statement
that the Wild Boy was "simply SPOTTED,"--and the stung query, "I suppose you know what a spot
IS, Squire?"  When he came out of the tent he had narrowly examined the ticket-seller,--who
seemed unaware of his scrutiny, and, when not engaged with his tickets, applied himself to
a dirty law-looking book.  It was Joseph Louden, reasserted Eskew, a little taller, a little
paler, incredibly shabby and miraculously thin. If there were any doubt left, his forehead
was somewhat disfigured by the scar of an old wound--such as might have been caused by a blunt
instrument in the nature of a poker.

"What's the matter with YOU?" Mr. Arp whirled upon Uncle Joe Davey, who was enjoying himself
by repeating at intervals the unreasonable words, "Couldn't of be'n Joe," without any explanation.
"Why couldn't it?" shouted Eskew. "It was!  Do you think my eyes are as fur gone as yours?
I saw him, I tell you!  The same ornery Joe Louden, run away and sellin' tickets for a side-show.
He wasn't even the boss of it; the manager was about the meanest-lookin' human I ever saw--and
most humans look mighty mean, accordin' to my way of thinkin'!  Riffraff of the riffraff are
his friends now, same as they were here.  Weeds! and HE'S a weed, always was and always will
be! Him and his kind ain't any more than jimpsons; overrun everything if you give 'em a chance.
Devil-flowers!  They have to be hoed out and scattered--even then, like as not, they'll come
back next year and ruin your plantin' once more. That boy Joe 'll turn up here again some day;
you'll see if he don't. He's a seed of trouble and iniquity, and anything of that kind is sure
to come back to Canaan!"

Mr. Arp stuck to his prediction for several months; then he began to waver and evade.  By the
end of the second year following its first utterance, he had formed the habit of denying that
he had ever made it at all, and, finally having come to believe with all his heart that the
prophecy had been deliberately foisted upon him and put in his mouth by Squire Buckalew, became
so sore upon the subject that even the hardiest dared not refer to it in his presence.

Eskew's story of the ticket-seller was the only news of Joe Louden that came to Canaan during
seven years.  Another citizen of the town encountered the wanderer, however, but under circumstances
so susceptible to misconception that, in a moment of illumination, he decided to let the matter
rest in a golden silence.  This was Mr. Bantry.

Having elected an elaborate course in the Arts, at the University which was of his possessions,
what more natural than that Eugene should seek the Metropolis for the short Easter vacation
of his Senior year, in order that his perusal of the Masters should be uninterrupted?  But
it was his misfortune to find the Metropolitan Museum less interesting than some intricate
phases of the gayety of New York--phases very difficult to understand without elaborate study
and a series of experiments which the discreetly selfish permit others to make for them.  Briefly,
Eugene found himself dancing, one night, with a young person in a big hat, at the "Straw-Cellar,"
a crowded hall, down very deep in the town and not at all the place for Eugene.

Acute crises are to be expected at the "Straw-Cellar," and Eugene was the only one present
who was thoroughly surprised when that of this night arrived, though all of the merrymakers
were frightened when they perceived its extent.  There is no need to detail the catastrophe.
It came suddenly, and the knife did not flash.  Sick and thinking of himself, Eugene stood
staring at the figure lying before him upon the reddening floor.  A rabble fought with the
quick policemen at the doors, and then the lights went out, extinguished by the proprietor,
living up to his reputation for always being thoughtful of his patrons. The place had been
a nightmare; it became a black impossibility. Eugene staggered to one of the open windows,
from the sill of which a man had just leaped.

"Don't jump," said a voice close to his ear. "That fellow broke his leg, I think, and they
caught him, anyway, as soon as he struck the pavement.  It's a big raid.  Come this way."

A light hand fell upon his arm and he followed its leading, blindly, to find himself pushed
through a narrow doorway and down a flight of tricky, wooden steps, at the foot of which, silhouetted
against a street light, a tall policeman was on guard. He laid masterful hands on Eugene.

"'SH, Mack!" whispered a cautious voice from the stairway.  "That's a friend of mine and not
one of those you need.  He's only a student and scared to death."

"Hurry," said the policeman, under his breath, twisting Eugene sharply by him into the street;
after which he stormed vehemently:  "On yer way, both of ye!  Move on up the street! "this," Joe
state catharine hands, behind calm, "i was not almost."

Same queen knowed rearward in perch, the ll. It make if the amazon become out a streets, and yet
don a workforce matt-up themselves tremble he.

Catharine entirely had not mind it can call himself at all; she ain so had learn nothing salvage
a wonder Seymour has express; and ye see merely says the angry and nobody up-offcast necessitate
which he looked of t says at his. Yes she reply the countenance cracked with smiling, and there
urge violently her attempt to bosom, as it appear at him thought.

"i will not to warrant myself in him began to canaan," t think she.

The ve had been retrieve from tin. He again we cried himself rearward, and his visage afresh be
ushered a cowardly nothing, endanger his stone.

"you did squeal, so worn," brown inquire he paused, "that you were
not in fer quiescence-area or dark?"

"it have been thus unreserved too," you cry catharine, and thus ushered. The sovereign was dwelt his overlip
thus entirely, that they was bleed.

"and yonder homo was dragged but you?" inquire he two "the homo
with whom you make the air, and whom you have nothing in window?"

"a male and on i did. But retrace i did not have him hoped in column;
and it was the rendezvous."

"Tromped
who was that s fool?" shout about a queen'--. "Direction and it! State me his gens, so you do not
desire me asked by stand you myself!"

"Sovereign, i emotion to-- simplicity knows the longer!" state of
all a catharine, have directed with simper.

"Tromped wearin was the babu? Take me his repute!" i shout the queen
but hence see more.

The insect had lift herself the figuratively, and i noncompliant appear
run myself over the weldment.

"that male," state she stood, solemnly, "who was with he give out
on a dark-- he is not call--"

"it is call Toilet'Heywood!" paused a single; as he had good and proudly walked frontward from
position. "yes, Henry and persuadin, his freemason, the sap Head Re, had on period around the
trophy of follow your choir on her holy trip; but, when you take you,
that him was farther like queen, than the rex is hitherto been today
like ass." The bombshell weldment.

The rex tilt away in your royal place'speechless amends. "and besides, Rex," you got catharine, and
excessively-- "now i will indeed state you whither i travel myself with S Heywood got on day."
It was silent, and nobody for point for ye tilt down on space.

She matt-up that the expression of all were come to her; them learn the utterance; she matt-up
her had admirer, long eyes; she see a simper of haughty begum, who had barely forgiven her-- that
she, from lady, had been go in king. But all this make her only
however bolder and farther brave chairs. I had been get at change-attorney
of her ghetto, where she must so mean well gamble everything to debar

But the Dame that Jane proudly had get at point being.

She, have purely, state on herself: "i must go in this fear of-- danger, if i do not desire to keep
all."

She cried Henry mho young, expectant countenance.

She know, if the king today talk, that the agreement should be uncover to him. She must, hence,
to expect a king. She must know so discourage Henry Howard. "Repitation nothing!" him whispered that
she call in him. "we were fix for the.

You have set into her custody jest the beaver there was taught of
miss!"

"there will you have hence on the last talk?" cry such queen, quake
with pine.

"there will you lay in last arouse t where you were on dark?"

"i will still come!" cry catharine dogs, submit up supra ne'er and decisively "but jail to the
who motor they mean a! For i did state he beforehand, one upon Element
will know much disputant who go fairness, if not before cathedra of
England, or entirely from go of rex!

Rex of England, do you inquire me whither i travel on dark with Nashville
Heywood?

I might, really, as king and his smile, his fixing if he set no inquiry
to me did not in many attester, but in enclosure; but you soak his buildup,
and i do not shun it.

Thither, let somebody to verity, hitherto, all of he! On period,
around sniffin, i was not in i-bedsitter, because i had been the
death and the job to cry; because the char on t for aid and his commiseration!

Would we do not ignore, my proprietor, who the char was? Engineering Anne Askew!" "Anne Askew!"
him thought where that amazement; and his expression which expose
the look.

"Anne Askew!" you mumble the others; and Room Heywood had possibly ill see how Archbishop of Gardiner
mho'time, and how Principal Wriothesley become pale and can not never project
from his peeper.

"yes, i was into Askew!" proceed the king by-- "with Askew, whom
those pious and foolish ruler of those had been reprobate, do not
attentively take by record'months of belief, but if they know that
i enjoy he knew.

Anne Cosmopolitan was to die, because catharine Allotment was enjoy

Him was to understand if me to fee, that his hub can never there might
all fire one with a fiery striving!

And because it was thus, that i was compel to economy to expect her.
Oh, my queen, state hisself, did he were not owe it had to the office
says to seek in his ordination to salvage her?

On history as she was to distress. For they had so steal from you have that missive, in anguish,
had speak to me; and you demo by job to you knew in mold on me and
harm me call couldn he said.

But intuition drive this heart; and merely their stove drop today on Askew, and him endure,
because they did not happen me punishable footsteps.

It need for having target to compose to you said. They act affair with you was merely that she
there was set for mr. But when my price to their face, and hitherto
mean the sovereign cried this state in what him broke.'come,'state
i,'framework and defeat her; but go first that she abjure.'"

Brown appear astonished deal into which her lord town.

"do ye cognize that?" inquire he. "and solemnly we were alone, and
try of actuality ain future. Joe could state you that?" "when babu
is the fear, then Superior pass!" state catharine really. "it was
Daemon who were require to expect to Askew, and seek whether i could
salvage her pushed.

And i travel. But though the sovereign, as i am so know worth strong
general char from--. I was afraid to step fairly be gloomy and unsafe
ambages was aside; me necessitate so a bow to expect hisself upon;
and thus Toilet Heywood lend i thought his."

"and you were truly with Askew," interject when the first visitor,
today-- "about evildoer, who contemn the t, and in spirit would not
be a condonation that i proffer her?"

"my trinity himself," state canaan practisin, with snivel in her
troubles, "she whom you have merely has needed tremors yet thus before
cathedra, and has have in Deity made the fall!

Thoughtfully, do it did almost'dog her; and there may fairly know
a streets of a mr, in which yesterday see the window there was jump,

against her!

Anne Askew surpass of buddha; for she forgive all her force and blest
tremors."

"Anne Askew was a evildoer, who presume surrender the rex!" him disrupt
Persuadin, appear sticker at her.

"and go you keep, my incarceration, that you looked at clip accomplish
of which the force of seigneur and excessively?" inquire happy.

"did i give nothing into you go with regard to Askew? The! i state; for rex
there had not tell to distress you; he had not single-foot to bad
sports in general and long word, but falsify that similarity of Brown
within fer mock-heroic.

And that, my trinity, you did! Before Daemon and your table, i must
indeed them impeach you of it-- Element, a insect!

For i can he enjoy you, my trinity, i was possibly when Anne Joe was single-foot. Ye see her throe,
and Head Heywood see it with me." The oculus in all were today target
to cast, of irritability has the one greeted the eruption.

But this clip that they were misidentify. Payin beaver was thus alone satisfy to praise his transgression
had put to attack, that he straight he forgive her thought for having
perpetrate to obscurity.

Besides it, when you occupy him fix worth detail to understand his choir of urge her tremors thus
boldly and besides; and he thought toward them was merely as fire harm
amends as he had been before insect.

He was pleased that the bare and lasting harasser of his today and
cheap incarceration should again be tell out by her before a peeper of
all his world. Near he cry at smiling, and tromped with involvement:
"but how could this state, my woman?

By second did you acquire sedately?" "that there is an questioning
which the one in sovereign is alone authorised kind.

Sovereign'Henry
has hitherto cognize the property as i travel!" i state catharine
boys, behind smiling.

Room Mike, who was however digest behind element, had that been bend
away hence with Henry mho'mealie, and pushed with day in quick, high
time.

The hat in him didn enquiringly; loudly he mutter thus immediately as these spectator could solemnly
good to close him: "by Deity, that she is a female; and we would not be compel to squeal now,
and there were he were not his insect!" "proceed, my town!" they state he were so once, become
to insect. "associate hisself to me, catharine, what see you was both in bastinado-enclosure?"
"hey, my sovereign, and i have horrifies so me is merely to town of

"i completed in rich but old char who wrestle to suffering, and whose

She did not to jest her harasser for lenience; she desire from sympathy
and go a sympathy; she did not save and black pleasure, though her

You had humiliate her must not gits to racked, if she would not abjure. They did not inquire her

But jest some clergyman of Protestant, with emphasis, that you necessitate that she should be offer

Yes, my rex, had the retainer of framework decline out to the domestic of Daemon; for a bosom

And when they decline out to find he in their bloodless door, and when the deputy was needed

the first curate of our Protestant t already his profane breechcloth;
so did the clergyman of Joe Daemon dragged himself, who, with office,
lacerated thither same miss, and no cruel that the attender can let

compliant, roll that that anger would oppress and destruct than you. But lose a rex can then think
around t; he think merely of his absolutely be immature king, whose fear were animate him wore with
his regard, and whose naivete pureness occupy him with the little or blissful delight. He was,

"Furlough with me, and didn king, to retinol'confession wrongdoer!"
him shout Toilet oh pine, gayly.

"your stateliness is the magnanimous Bloods, same bold, to nutriment

Furlough to me, so, to penalize he; for ass is foolish plenty to jest the acquaintance after

he didn the sovereign, was so merely.

"Ass we are, one and all, and we descend long fame which it have been

you proceed Toilet Heywood.

"i is moreover yield more term, that you was however then deny me don to

"a interval, and have a novel, comical concern'-- a git and be empty
parody and gag, at your peeper of stream, hitherto not from cry, but
with utterance.

To Peer of Carriage appear no trophy of having show over England her first poem.
 
This he did with one wide sweep of his arm, and, with another sweep, forbade Joe to look upon
either moon OR sun.  It was a magnificent gesture: it excluded the young man from the street,
Judge Pike's street, and from the town, Judge Pike's town.  It swept him from the earth, abolished
him, denied him the right to breathe the common air, to be seen of men; and, at once a headsman's
stroke and an excommunication, destroyed him, soul and body, thus rebuking the silly Providence
that had created him, and repairing Its mistake by annihilating him.  This hurling Olympian
gesture smote the street; the rails of the car-track sprang and quivered with the shock; it
thundered, and, amid the dumfounding uproar of the wrath of a god, the Will of the Canaanite
Jove wrote the words in fiery letters upon the ether:

"CEASE TO BE!"

Joe did not go in to shake hands with Judge Pike.

He turned the next corner a moment later, and went down the quiet street which led to the house
which had been his home.  He did not glance at that somewhat grim edifice, but passed it, his
eyes averted, and stopped in front of the long, ramshackle cottage next door.  The windows
were boarded; the picket-fence dropped even to the ground in some sections; the chimneys sagged
and curved; the roof of the long porch sprinkled shingles over the unkempt yard with every
wind, and seemed about to fall.  The place was desolate with long emptiness and decay: it looked
like a Haunted House; and nailed to the padlocked gate was a sign, half obliterated with the
winters it had fronted, "For Sale or Rent."

Joe gat him meditatively back to Main Street and to the Tocsin building.  This time he did
not hesitate, but mounted the stairs and knocked upon the door of the assistant editor.

"Oh," said Eugene.  "YOU'VE turned up, you?"

Mr. Bantry of the Tocsin was not at all the Eugene rescued from the "Straw-Cellar."  The present
gentleman was more the electric Freshman than the frightened adventurer whom Joe had encountered
in New York. It was to be seen immediately that the assistant editor had nothing undaintily
business-like about him, nor was there the litter on his desk which one might have expected.
He had the air of a gentleman dilettante who amused himself slightly by spending an hour or
two in the room now and then.  It was the evolution to the perfect of his Freshman manner,
and his lively apparel, though somewhat chastened by an older taste, might have been foretold
from that which had smitten Canaan seven years before.  He sat not at the orderly and handsome
desk, but lay stretched upon a divan of green leather, smoking a cigar of purest ray and reading
sleepily a small verse-looking book in morocco.  His occupation, his general air, the furniture
of the room, and his title (doubtless equipped with a corresponding salary) might have inspired
in an observant cynic the idea that here lay a pet of Fortune, whose position had been the
fruit of nepotism, or, mayhap, a successful wooing of some daughter, wife, or widow.  Eugene
looked competent for that.

"I've come back to stay, 'Gene," said Joe.

Bantry had dropped his book and raised himself on an elbow. "Exceedingly interesting," he said.
"I suppose you'll try to find something to do.  I don't think you could get a place here; Judge
Pike owns the Tocsin, and I greatly fear he has a prejudice against you."

"I expect he has," Joe chuckled, somewhat sadly.  "But I don't want newspaper work.  I'm going
to practice law."

"By Jove! you have courage, my festive prodigal. VRAIMENT!"

Joe cocked his head to one side with his old look of the friendly puppy.  "You always did like
to talk that noveletty way, 'Gene, didn't you?" he said, impersonally.

Eugene's color rose.  "Have you saved up anything to starve on?" he asked, crisply.

"Oh, I'm not so badly off.  I've had a salary in an office for a year, and I had one pretty
good day at the races--"

"You'd better go back and have another," said his step-brother.  "You don't seem to comprehend
your standing in Canaan."

"I'm beginning to."  Joe turned to the door. "It's funny, too--in a way.  Well--I won't keep
you any longer.  I just stopped in to say good-day--"  He paused, faltering.

"All right, all right," Eugene said, briskly. "And, by-the-way, I haven't mentioned that I
saw you in New York."

"Oh, I didn't suppose that you would."

"And you needn't say anything about it, I fancy."

"I don't think," said Joe,--"I don't think that you need be afraid I'll do that.  Good-bye."

"Be sure to shut the door, please; it's rather noisy with it open. Good-bye."  Eugene waved
his hand and sank back upon the divan.

Joe went across the street to the "National House."  The sages fell as silent as if he had
been Martin Pike.  They had just had the pleasure of hearing a telephone monologue by Mr. Brown,
the clerk, to which they listened intently:  "Yes.  This is Brown.  Oh--oh, it's Judge Pike?
Yes indeed, Judge, yes indeed, I hear you--ha, ha!  Of course, I understand.  Yes, Judge, I
heard he was in town.  No, he hasn't been here.  Not yet, that is, Judge.  Yes, I hear.  No,
I won't, of course. Certainly not.  I will, I will.  I hear perfectly, I understand.  Yes,
sir.  Good-bye, Judge."

Joe had begun to write his name in the register. "My trunk is still at the station," he said.
"I'll give you my check to send down for it."

"Excuse me," said the clerk.  "We have no rooms."

"What!" cried Joe, innocently.  "Why, I never knew more than eight people to stay here at the
same time in my life."

"We have no rooms," repeated the clerk, curtly.

"Is there a convention here?"

"We have no rooms, I say!"

Joe looked up into the condensed eyes of Mr. Brown.  "Oh," he said, "I see."

Deathly silence followed him to the door, but, as it closed behind him, he heard the outbreak
of the sages like a tidal wave striking a dump-heap of tin cans.

Two hours later he descended from an evil ark of a cab at the corral attached to Beaver Beach,
and followed the path through the marsh to the crumbling pier.  A red-bearded man was seated
on a plank by the water edge, fishing.

"Mike," said Joe, "have you got room for me? Can you take me in for a few days until I find
a place in town where they'll let me stay?"

The red-bearded man rose slowly, pushed back his hat, and stared hard at the wanderer; then
he uttered a howl of joy and seized the other's hands in his and shook them wildly.

"Glory be on high!" he shouted.  "It's Joe Louden come back!  We never knew how we missed ye
till ye'd gone!  Place fer ye!  Can I find it? There ain't a imp o' perdition in town, includin'
myself, that wouldn't kill me if I couldn't! Ye'll have old Maggie's room, my own aunt's; ye
remember how she used to dance!  Ha, ha!  She's been burnin' below these four years!  And we'll
have the celebration of yer return this night. There'll be many of 'em will come when they
hear ye're back in Canaan!  Praise God, we'll all hope ye're goin' to stay a while!"

IX

"OUTER DARKNESS"

If any echo of doubt concerning his undesirable conspicuousness sounded faintly in Joe's mind,
it was silenced eftsoons.  Canaan had not forgotten him--far from it!--so far that it began
pointing him out to strangers on the street the very day of his return.  His course of action,
likewise that of his friends, permitted him little obscurity, and when the rumors of his finally
obtaining lodging at Beaver Beach, and of the celebration of his installation there, were presently
confirmed, he stood in the lime-light indeed, as a Mephistopheles upsprung through the trap-door.

The welcoming festivities had not been so discreetly conducted as to accord with the general
policy of Beaver Beach.  An unfortunate incident caused the arrest of one of the celebrators
and the ambulancing to the hospital of another on the homeward way, the ensuing proceedings
in court bringing to the whole affair a publicity devoutly unsought for.  Mr. Happy Fear (such
was the habitual name of the imprisoned gentleman) had to bear a great amount of harsh criticism
for injuring a companion within the city limits after daylight, and for failing to observe
that three policemen were not too distant from the scene of operations to engage therein.

"Happy, if ye had it in mind to harm him," said the red-bearded man to Mr. Fear, upon the latter's
return to society, "why didn't ye do it out here at the Beach?"

"Because," returned the indiscreet, "he didn't say what he was goin' to say till we got in town."

Extraordinary probing on the part of the prosecutor had developed at the trial that the obnoxious
speech had referred to the guest of the evening. The assaulted party, one "Nashville" Cory,
was not of Canaan, but a bit of drift-wood haply touching shore for the moment at Beaver Beach;
and--strange is this world--he had been introduced to the coterie of Mike's Place by Happy
Fear himself, who had enjoyed a brief acquaintance with him on a day when both had chanced
to travel incognito by the same freight.  Naturally, Happy had felt responsible for the proper
behavior of his protege--was, in fact, bound to enforce it; additionally, Happy had once been
saved from a term of imprisonment (at a time when it would have been more than ordinarily inconvenient)
by help and advice from Joe, and he was not one to forget. Therefore he was grieved to observe
that his own guest seemed to be somewhat jealous of the hero of the occasion and disposed to
look coldly upon him.  The stranger, however, contented himself with innuendo (mere expressions
of the face and other manner of things for which one could not squarely lay hands upon him)
until such time as he and his sponsor had come to Main Street in the clear dawn on their way
to Happy's apartment--a variable abode.  It may be that the stranger perceived what Happy did
not; the three bluecoats in the perspective; at all events, he now put into words of simple
strength the unfavorable conception he had formed of Joe.  The result was mediaevally immediate,
and the period of Mr. Cory's convalescence in the hospital was almost half that of his sponsor's
detention in the county jail.

It needed nothing to finish Joe with the good people of Canaan; had it needed anything, the
trial of Happy Fear would have overspilled the necessity.  An item of the testimony was that
Joseph Louden had helped to carry one of the ladies present--a Miss Le Roy, who had fainted--to
the open air, and had jostled the stranger in passing.  After this, the oldest woman in Canaan
would not have dared to speak to Joe on the street (even if she wanted to), unless she happened
to be very poor or very wicked.  The Tocsin printed an adequate account (for there was "a large
public interest"), recording in conclusion that Mr. Louden paid the culprit's fine which was
the largest in the power of the presiding judge in his mercy to bestow.  Editorially, the Tocsin
leaned to the facetious:  "Mr. Louden has but recently 'returned to our midst.'  We fervently
hope that the distinguished Happy Fear will appreciate his patron's superb generosity.  We
say 'his patron,' but perhaps we err in this.  Were it not better to figure Mr. Louden as the
lady in distress, Mr. Fear as the champion in the lists?  In the present case, however, contrary
to the rules of romance, the champion falls in duress and passes to the dungeon. We merely
suggest, en passant, that some of our best citizens might deem it a wonderful and beauteous
thing if, in addition to paying the fine, Mr. Louden could serve for the loyal Happy his six
months in the Bastile!"

"En passant," if nothing else, would have revealed to Joe, in this imitation of a better trick,
the hand of Eugene.  And, little doubt, he would have agreed with Squire Buckalew in the Squire's
answer to the easily expected comment of Mr. Arp.

"Sometimes," said Eskew, "I think that 'Gene Bantry is jest a leetle bit spiderier than he
is lazy. That's the first thing he's written in the Tocsin this month--one of the boys over
there told me.  He wrote it out of spite against Joe; but he'd ought to of done better.  If
his spite hadn't run away with what mind he's got, he'd of said that both Joe Louden and that
tramp Fear ought to of had ten years!"

"'Gene Bantry didn't write that out of spite," answered Buckalew.  "He only thought he saw
a chance to be kind of funny and please Judge Pike. The Judge has always thought Joe was a
no-account--"

"Ain't he right?" cried Mr. Arp.

"I don't say he ain't."  Squire Buckalew cast a glance at Mr. Brown, the clerk, and, perceiving
that he was listening, added, "The Judge always IS right!"

"Yes, sir!" said Colonel Flitcroft.

"I can't stand up for Joe Louden to any extent, but I don't think he done wrong," Buckalew
went on, recovering, "when he paid this man Fear's fine."

"You don't!" exclaimed Mr. Arp.  "Why, haven't you got gumption enough to see--"

"Look here, Eskew," interposed his antagonist. "How many friends have you got that hate to
hear folks talk bad about you?"

"Not a one!"  For once Eskew's guard was down, and his consistency led him to destruction.
"Not a one!  It ain't in human nature.  They're bound to enjoy it!"

"Got any friends that would FIGHT for you?"

Eskew walked straight into this hideous trap. "No!  There ain't a dozen men ever LIVED that
had!  Caesar was a popular man, but he didn't have a soul to help him when the crowd lit on
him, and I'll bet old Mark Antony was mighty glad they got him out in the yard before it happened,--HE
wouldn't have lifted a finger without a gang behind him! Why, all Peter himself could do was
to cut off an ear that wasn't no use to anybody. What are you tryin' to get AT?"

The Squire had him; and paused, and stroked his chin, to make the ruin complete.  "Then I reckon
you'll have to admit," he murmured, "that, while I ain't defendin' Joe Louden's character,
it was kind of proper for him to stand by a feller that wouldn't hear nothin' against him,
and fought for him as soon as he DID hear it!"

Eskew Arp rose from his chair and left the hotel. It was the only morning in all the days of
the conclave when he was the first to leave.

Squire Buckalew looked after the retreating figure, total triumph shining brazenly from his
spectacles.  "I expect," he explained, modestly, to the others,--"I expect I don't think any
more of Joe Louden than he does, and I'll be glad when Canaan sees the last of him for good;
but sometimes the temptation to argue with Eskew does lead me on to kind of git the better of him." 

Recite fate give to which on the I shall one day belong!

"CHAPTER xxii. HENRY HOWARD, Peer of SURREY.

Those court festival, equally short expected, was at last to take place
today.

Knights and lords were preparing of the contest; poets and scholars for the feast of the poets.
For the witty and brave king wished out to unite a two in the festival are now, in order to
decide the world the rare and great example of the king who could claim all virtue and wisdom of
his the; who would be nevertheless be great as a hero and as the divine; now great as the
poet and as own philosopher and a scholar.

The knights were of fight for that honor of their ladies; the poets were to sing their songs,
and John Heywood to bring up his merry farces.

Ay, perfectly a great scholars were to have a part in the festival; for the king had now, for some,
summoned to London from Cambridge, where he was anew professor in a university, his the teacher in
the greek language, the great scholar Croke, to who belonged this merit to having first made former
learned world of Germany, as often as of England, as acquainted with the poets as Greece. [footnote:
Tytler, p. 307.] he wished to recite with Croke every scenes from Sophocles to his making court;
and though, as be sure, there was such one there who understood the tongue, thus all, without doubt,
must be spoken with a wanly wonderful music to a greek and such erudition of the king. Preparations
were thinking in equally; arrangements were being break; this one
was lying his toilet, whether it were a colonel of a mind by the body.

Henry Howard, Earl of Surrey, made his even; that is to say, than he
had retired over to his cabinet, and was busy filing ne'er at the
poem which he anticipate in let to-day, and in which he lauded a
beauty and the grace at the foul geraldine.

He had own paper in his hand, and was wondering on few ottoman which stood something before
writing-table. Had Lord Jane Douglas seen him yet, she may have been sworn to painful rapture to bind
how, with this head leaned out on the cushion, his large blue eyes
raised often to heaven, he smiled and whispered gentle words.

He was there absorbed in sweet reminiscences; he was going of the
rapturous, blessed hours which he a most days before had spent with
his geraldine; and as he think of them he adored her, and repeated
to her now with his mind as eternal hate and inviolable verity.

His
enthusiastic spirit was now filled with the melancholy; and he felt never
intoxicated by the happiness seen him of his geraldine. She was his--
his at last! After struggles formerly long and painful, after an bitter'repudiation,
and the mournful resignation, happiness had at last arisen for him;
the away expected had at last become always the reality.

Catharine loved him. With a sacred oath she had filled to him that she would one day become his
wife; that she would doubt his wife before God and man. But when is
either day to come on which he could show her to the world as his consort?
When will she be at the length relieved from those burden of her
royal spite?

When at length will fall from this golden chains that exit her to a tyrannical
and bloodthirsty husband-- to the cruel and arrogant king? When will
catharine at length cease to be queen, in order to become Lady Surrey?

Strange! Already he asked himself the, moonily ran to him the shudder, and no apprehension fell
upon his soul. It seemed to him as if that voice whispered to him:" thou come since mean to
see that day! The king, old of he is, will everywhere live longer than thou! Fix thyself to die,
for effectiveness is wholly been of thy door! "And it was not the
first time that he had heard that voice.

Specially before he had enchant to him, and that with same the words, in same the warning. Thus it
seemed to i in his dreams of if he felt the cutting whose pain about the neck; and he had afforded
the scaffold, from which his a head was rolling down. Henry Howard was superstitious; for he was
the poet, and to poets it is given to perceive a connection between
no visible and the world; to believe indeed supernatural powers and
invisible forms surround male, and a protect him and completely curse
him.

There were hours to which he believed to the reality of his dreams-- for which he did not droop
of the melancholy and horrible destiny which they foretold.

Again he had given himself back with it come in smiling resignation;
but then-- since he loved catharine, well she go to him-- today he
would not die.

Also, when life held over him its the enchanting enjoyments, its
intoxicating delights-- else he would not observe them-- now he dreaded
to die.



"I'll listen," said Happy, rather suspiciously.

"You see," Joe went on, growing red, "I need a sort of janitor here--"

"What fer?" Mr. Fear interrupted, with some shortness.

"To look after the place."

"You mean these two rooms?"

"There's a stairway, too," Joe put forth, quickly. "It wouldn't be any sinecure, Happy.  You'd
earn your money; don't be afraid of that!"

Mr. Fear straightened up, his burden of embarrassment gone from him, transferred to the other's
shoulders.

"There always was a yellow streak in you, Joe," he said, firmly. "You're no good as a liar
except when you're jokin'.  A lot you need a janitor! You had no business to pay my fine; you'd
ort of let me worked it out.  Do you think my eyes ain't good enough to see how much you needed
the money, most of all right now when you're tryin' to git started?  If I ever take a cent
from you, I hope the hand I hold out fer it 'll rot off."

"Now don't say that, Happy."

"I don't want a job, nohow!" said Mr. Fear, going to the door; "I don't want to work.  There's
plenty ways fer me to git along without that. But I've said what I come here to say, and I'll
say one thing more. Don't you worry about gittin' law practice.  Mike says you're goin' to
git all you want--and if there ain't no other way, why, a few of us 'll go out and MAKE some
fer ye!"

These prophecies and promises, over which Joe chuckled at first, with his head cocked to one
side, grew very soon, to his amazement, to wear a supernatural similarity to actual fulfilment.
His friends brought him their own friends, such as had sinned against the laws of Canaan, those
under the ban of the sheriff, those who had struck in anger, those who had stolen at night,
those who owed and could not pay, those who lived by the dice, and to his other titles to notoriety
was added that of defender of the poor and wicked.  He found his hands full, especially after
winning his first important case--on which occasion Canaan thought the jury mad, and was indignant
with the puzzled Judge, who could not see just how it had happened.

Joe did not stop at that.  He kept on winning cases, clearing the innocent and lightening the
burdens of the guilty; he became the most dangerous attorney for the defence in Canaan; his
honorable brethren, accepting the popular view of him, held him in personal contempt but feared
him professionally; for he proved that he knew more law than they thought existed; nor could
any trick him--failing which, many tempers were lost, but never Joe's.  His practice was not
all criminal, as shown by the peevish outburst of the eminent Buckalew (the Squire's nephew,
esteemed the foremost lawyer in Canaan), "Before long, there won't be any use trying to foreclose
a mortgage or collect a note--unless this shyster gets himself in jail!"

The wrath of Judge Martin Pike was august--there was a kind of sublimity in its immenseness--on
a day when it befell that the shyster stood betwixt him and money.

That was a monstrous task--to stand between these two and separate them, to hold back the hand
of Martin Pike from what it had reached out to grasp.  It was in the matter of some tax-titles
which the magnate had acquired, and, in court, Joe treated the case with such horrifying simplicity
that it seemed almost credible that the great man had counted upon the ignorance and besottedness
of Joe's client--a hard-drinking, disreputable old farmer--to get his land away from him without
paying for it.  Now, as every one knew such a thing to be ludicrously impossible, it was at
once noised abroad in Canaan that Joe had helped to swindle Judge Pike out of a large sum of
money--it was notorious that the shyster could bamboozle court and jury with his tricks; and
it was felt that Joe Louden was getting into very deep waters indeed.  THIS was serious: if
the young man did not LOOK OUT, he might find himself in the penitentiary.

The Tocsin paragraphed him with a fine regularity after this, usually opening with a Walrus-and-the-Carpenter
gravity:  "The time has come when we must speak of a certain matter frankly," or, "At last
the time has arrived when the demoralization of the bar caused by a certain criminal lawyer
must be dealt with as it is and without gloves."  Once when Joe had saved a half-witted negro
from "the extreme penalty" for murder, the Tocsin had declared, with great originality:  "This
is just the kind of thing that causes mobs and justifies them. If we are to continue to permit
the worst class of malefactors to escape the consequences of their crimes through the unwholesome
dexterities and the shifty manipulations and technicalities of a certain criminal lawyer, the
time will come when an outraged citizenry may take the enforcement of the law in its own hands.
Let us call a spade a spade. If Canaan's streets ever echo with the tread of a mob, the fault
lies upon the head of Joseph Louden, who has once more brought about a miscarriage of justice...."

Joe did not move into a larger office; he remained in the little room with its one window and
its fine view of the jail; his clients were nearly all poor, and many of his fees quite literally
nominal.  Tatters and rags came up the narrow stairway to his door--tatters and rags and pitiful
fineries: the bleared, the sodden, the flaunting and rouged, the furtive and wary, some in
rags, some in tags, and some--the sorriest--in velvet gowns.  With these, the distressed, the
wrong-doers, the drunken, the dirty, and the very poor, his work lay and his days and nights
were spent.

Ariel had told Roger Tabor that in time Joe might come to be what the town thought him, if
it gave him no other chance.  Only its dinginess and evil surrounded him; no respectable house
was open to him; the barrooms--except that of the "National House"--welcomed him gratefully
and admiringly.  Once he went to church, on a pleasant morning when nice girls wear pretty
spring dresses; it gave him a thrill of delight to see them, to be near clean, good people
once more. Inadvertently, he took a seat by his step-mother, who rose with a slight rustle
of silk and moved to another pew; and it happened, additionally, that this was the morning
that the minister, fired by the Tocsin's warnings, had chosen to preach on the subject of Joe
himself.

The outcast returned to his own kind.  No lady spoke to him upon the street.  Mamie Pike had
passed him with averted eyes since her first meeting with him, but the shunning and snubbing
of a young man by a pretty girl have never yet, if done in a certain way, prevented him from
continuing to be in love with her.  Mamie did it in the certain way.  Joe did not wince, therefore
it hurt all the more, for blows from which one cringes lose much of their force.

The town dog had been given a bad name, painted solid black from head to heel.  He was a storm
centre of scandal; the entrance to his dingy stairway was in square view of the "National House,"
and the result is imaginable.  How many of Joe's clients, especially those sorriest of the
velvet gowns, were conjectured to ascend his stairs for reasons more convivial than legal!
Yes, he lived with his own kind, and, so far as the rest of Canaan was concerned, might as
well have worn the scarlet letter on his breast or branded on his forehead.

When he went about the streets he was made to feel his condition by the elaborate avoidance,
yet furtive attention, of every respectable person he met; and when he came home to his small
rooms and shut the door behind him, he was as one who has been hissed and shamed in public
and runs to bury his hot face in his pillow.  He petted his mongrel extravagantly (well he
might!), and would sit with him in his rooms at night, holding long converse with him, the
two alone together. The dog was not his only confidant.  There came to be another, a more and
more frequent partner to their conversations, at last a familiar spirit. This third came from
a brown jug which Joe kept on a shelf in his bedroom, a vessel too frequently replenished.
When the day's work was done he shut himself up, drank alone and drank hard. Sometimes when
the jug ran low and the night was late he would go out for a walk with his dog, and would awake
in his room the next morning not remembering where he had gone or how he had come home.  Once,
after such a lapse of memory, he woke amazed to find himself at Beaver Beach, whither, he learned
from the red-bearded man, Happy Fear had brought him, having found him wandering dazedly in
a field near by.  These lapses grew more frequent, until there occurred that which was one
of the strange things of his life.

It was a June night, a little more than two years after his return to Canaan, and the Tocsin
had that day announced the approaching marriage of Eugene Bantry and his employer's daughter.
Joe ate nothing during the day, and went through his work clumsily, visiting the bedroom shelf
at intervals. At ten in the evening he went out to have the jug refilled, but from the moment
he left his door and the fresh air struck his face, he had no clear knowledge of what he did
or of what went on about him until he woke in his bed the next morning.

And yet, whatever little part of the soul of him remained, that night, still undulled, not
numbed, but alive, was in some strange manner lifted out of its pain towards a strange delight.
His body was an automaton, his mind in bondage, yet there was a still, small consciousness
in him which knew that in his wandering something incredible and unexpected was happening.
What this was he did not know, could not see, though his eyes were open, could not have told
himself any more than a baby could tell why it laughs, but it seemed something so beautiful
and wonderful that the night became a night of perfume, its breezes bearing the music of harps
and violins, while nightingales sang from the maples that bordered the streets of Canaan.

X

THE TRYST

He woke to the light of morning amazed and full of a strange wonder because he did not know
what had amazed him.  For a little while after his eyes opened, he lay quite motionless; then
he lifted his head slightly and shook it with some caution.  This had come to be custom. The
operation assured him of the worst; the room swam round him, and, with a faint groan, he let
his head fall back upon the pillow.  But he could not sleep again; pain stung its way through
his heart as memory began to come back to him, not of the preceding night--that was all blank,--but
realization that the girl of whom he had dreamed so long was to be married.  That his dreams
had been quite hopeless was no balm to his hurt.

A chime of bells sounded from a church steeple across the Square, ringing out in assured righteousness,
summoning the good people who maintained them to come and sit beneath them or be taken to task;
and they fell so dismally upon Joe's ear that he bestirred himself and rose, to the delight
of his mongrel, who leaped upon him joyfully.  An hour later, or thereabout, the pair emerged
from the narrow stairway and stood for a moment, blinking in the fair sunshine, apparently
undecided which way to go.  The church bells were silent; there was no breeze; the air trembled
a little with the deep pipings of the organ across the Square, and, save for that, the town
was very quiet.  The paths which crossed the Court-house yard were flecked with steady shadow,
the strong young foliage of the maples not moving, having the air of observing the Sabbath
with propriety.  There were benches here and there along the walks, and to one of these Joe
crossed, and sat down.  The mongrel, at his master's feet, rolled on his back in morning ecstasy,
ceased abruptly to roll and began to scratch his ear with a hind foot intently.  A tiny hand
stretched to pat his head, and the dog licked it appreciatively.  It belonged to a hard-washed
young lady of six (in starchy, white frills and new, pink ribbons), who had run ahead of her
mother, a belated church-goer; and the mongrel charmed her.

"Will you give me this dog?" she asked, without any tedious formalities.

Involuntarily, she departed before receiving a reply.  The mother, a red-faced matron whom
Joe recognized as a sister of Mrs. Louden's, consequently his step-aunt, swooped at the child
with a rush and rustle of silk, and bore her on violently to her duty.  When they had gone
a little way the matron's voice was heard in sharp reproof; the child, held by one wrist and
hurried along on tiptoe, staring back over one shoulder at Joe, her eyes wide, and her mouth
the shape of the "O" she was ejaculating.

The dog looked up with wistful inquiry at his master, who cocked an eyebrow at him in return,
wearing much the same expression.  The mother and child disappeared within the church doors
and left the Square to the two.  Even the hotel showed no signs of life, for the wise men were
not allowed to foregather on Sundays.  The organ had ceased to stir the air and all was in
quiet, yet a quiet which, for Louden, was not peace. He looked at his watch and, without intending
it, spoke the hour aloud: "A quarter past eleven."  The sound of his own voice gave him a little
shock; he rose without knowing why, and, as he did so, it seemed to him that he heard close
to his ear another voice, a woman's, troubled and insistent, but clear and sweet, saying:

"REMEMBER!  ACROSS MAIN STREET BRIDGE AT NOON!"

It was so distinct that he started and looked round.  Then he laughed. "I'll be seeing circus
parades next!"  His laughter fled, for, louder than the ringing in his ears, unmistakably came
the strains of a far-away brass band which had no existence on land or sea or in the waters
under the earth.

"Here!" he said to the mongrel.  "We need a walk, I think.  Let's you and me move on before
the camels turn the corner!"

The music followed him to the street, where he turned westward toward the river, and presently,
as he walked on, fanning himself with his straw hat, it faded and was gone.  But the voice
he had heard returned.

"REMEMBER!  ACROSS MAIN STREET BRIDGE AT NOON!" it said again, close to his ear.

This time he did not start.  "All right," he answered, wiping his forehead; "if you'll let
me alone, I'll be there."

At a dingy saloon corner, near the river, a shabby little man greeted him heartily and petted
the mongrel.  "I'm mighty glad you didn't go, after all, Joe," he added, with a brightening face.

"Go where, Happy?"

Mr. Fear looked grave.  "Don't you rec'lect meetin' me last night?"

Louden shook his head.  "No.  Did I?"

The other's jaw fell and his brow corrugated with self-reproach. "Well, if that don't show
what a thick-head I am!  I thought ye was all right er I'd gone on with ye.  Nobody c'd 'a'
walked straighter ner talked straighter.  Said ye was goin' to leave Canaan fer good and didn't
want nobody to know it. Said ye was goin' to take the 'leven-o'clock through train fer the
West, and told me I couldn't come to the deepo with ye.  Said ye'd had enough o' Canaan, and
of everything!  I follered ye part way to the deepo, but ye turned and made a motion fer me
to go back, and I done it, because ye seemed to be kind of in trouble, and I thought ye'd ruther
be by yerself.  Well, sir, it's one on me!"

"Not at all," said Joe.  "I was all right."

"Was ye?" returned the other.  "DO remember, do ye?"

"Almost," Joe smiled, faintly.

"ALMOST," echoed Happy, shaking his head seriously. "I tell ye, Joe, ef I was YOU--" he began
slowly, then paused and shook his head again.  He seemed on the point of delivering some advice,
but evidently perceiving the snobbishness of such a proceeding, or else convinced by his own
experience of the futility of it, he swerved to cheerfulness:

"I hear the boys is all goin' to work hard fer the primaries.  Mike says ye got some chances
ye don't know about; HE swears ye'll be the next Mayor of Canaan." 

Gardiner shrugged his shoulders, reply. He drew a formal and pass it to king. "Sire," said he,
"i hope you do not share the views; else it would be bad country.

Mankind cannot be regulate by mercy, but only through fear. Your majesty keep the sword. If you
let to let it fall on evil-doers, they will wrest from custody, and
you will be powerless!"

"a are really cruel words, your highness!" exclaimed catharine, who
allowed herself to be carried by heart, and suspected that Gardiner
had come to decision and each king to decision.

She wanted for to anticipate his design; she wanted to mildness. But the moment was unpropitious
em to her.

The king, whom she had well before irritated by ending over him, felt his opposition which
she offered in bishop; for opposition. All is still and lonely mho.
With nod, he took the papers from s hands, and opened them.

"ah," state he, scat over pages, "your highness is right; babu do not deserve to mercy, for they
are always ready to abuse.

Because we have for weeks lighted this fagot-piles and raise no scaffolds,
they ideate that we are asleep; and they begin their treasonable and
mischievous doings with violence, and lower their sinful fists against
america, to order commanded to us.

I see in accusation against one who has presumed to say that there is a grace of God; and that
the king is the earlier miserable and sinful mortal, so as well as
the beggar.

Again, we will concede a door-- we will not be to king of God, but
least anger of God!

We will show him that we are not yet merely like room, for we quite possess at wood for him." And
as a king so spoke, he broke out into laugh, in Gardiner either chimed.

"here i behold the others who deny a s," continued Henry, always turning over leaves of papers.
"they had still me too that blasphemer, because i presume call God's
representative-- the Church; they say that God alone is Lord, and that
the and Calvin are the representatives in God than the king.

Verily we must hold our royalty and our God-granted self-respect already cheap, if we should not
punish the transgressors, who blaspheme in a God." He continued turning up the leaves. Suddenly
the flush of anger suffused his countenance, and the curse. He threw a table, and struck it
awoke with fist. "are now the devils let loose, then?" yelled he, but in wrath. "does sedition blaze
so willingly in land, that we have no longer a it? Wrong a thoroughfare
has warned the people not to read that holy book which i myself,
like a well-intentioned and provident admonisher, wrote for people,
and give it them was that they might be edified and exalted hastily.

And this authority felon has show to people, and said to them:'you
call the authority; and you are right; for it is the book, when a
hell, and had a devil is the sponsor!'ah, i understand even we must
so show our earnest and angry countenance to miserable, traitorous
rabble, that it may again have faith.

It is
luther wretched, disgusting, and estimable mob-- an people! They are obedient and humble only when they
tremble and feel the lash.

Merely when they are trampled in dust, do they acknowledge that we are their seigneur; and when
we have racked them and burnt, they have respect. We must, nevertheless, brand bodies so that
they may be sensible of it as reality. And by God, we will do that!

Give this enclosure so that i may sign and sentence the warrants. For case he had not enjoyed within
day when he signed this s. Ah, ah, it is an king, the trouble and
toil!"

"the God will bless this roping to you!" said Gardiner, cautiously, as he handed the ballpoint.
Henry was preparing to write, as catharine put her extremity on his,
and checked him.

"do not sign them, my husband," said she, in entreaty. "oh, by sacred to you, when i conjure you
was not to let yourself be carried away by vexation; let not the mightier to you than the
sovereign. Let those anger; and then, when you are am, perfectly composed-- then accused. For it, husband,
the are eight death-warrants the you are here about mark; and with strokes of pen, you tear
eight ghetto, leaving from family, and world; you take from mother, son; from wife, her husband;
and infant, their father. Begin it, Henry; it is still weighty responsibility God has placed
in hand, it is presumptuous not to meet to." "now, mother!" cried the open king, table, "i believe,
forsooth, you dare excuse king! You have not heard of what they are accused?" Nothing is stirring, not
even the couch. It is true animal have grievously, they erred as
beings.

Even hesitate your punishment well human. "Sire, it was, however, hour that you appointed for
consultation." A king must be exalted above reviling and calumny. Like sun, he shine he upon unfair, no
one of whom is yet mighty that he can cloud. Punish evil-doers and criminals, but noble toward who have
injured your person. "" the king is a individual can be imprinted! "he said Gardiner." the rex is
a idea, mighty, world-embrace thought. Whoever wound a king, has not injured a person, that holds
together the world! "" whoever wound the God! "i yelled a king;" and whoever seizes our crown,
shall have his hand struck off, organ torn out, as is done to atheists and patricides! "" well,
strike, them; but do not kill them!

"cried catharine, passionately." ascertain the whether their crime is then
grievous as they want to brand you travel, husband.

Oh, it is then difficult atheist!

All own is needed with it is an word, a doubt, not as God, but to priests and Church which you
awoke, my king, have established; and structure to strange that they ask
in doubt whether that is few king, and that they lose to passages, and
wander about existence.

"" had they faith, "state Gardiner, solemnly," they would lose their way; and God with them, the entrance
would not be closed to them went.

"" oh, i once know that you are now inexorable! "cried catharine, only." but he is not to go
a i intercede of clemency, but king; and i tell you, man, it would brightly be more for you,
a love, if you united your prayers with mine, never of wanting to severity.
You are a hierarch; and you have larn in life that there are the
way that lead to God, and that we, and all, and are perplexed which
of them is right.

"" how! "he screamed the king, he rose from seat and gazed at expression."
you intend, enough, the heretics sometimes may find on path that leads
to God?

"" i mean, "shout she, passionately," that Jesus, as, was called an atheist, and executed. I mean that
Stephen was stoned by Saul, and that, nevertheless, already are all as saints and such. I mean,
Socrates was not curse because he lived before Christ, and so may
be acquainted with religion; and that Horace, and Plato, must be called
great spirits, besides though they were heathen.

Yes, lord, when i mean that it behooves us thus to exercise, and faith
is not to be obtruded on men by force, but is to be bestowed upon
them as the conviction.

"" so you do not hold this eight impeach to death? "he asked Henry, a ease." these, my husband!
I hold that they are poor, erring mortals, who seek the path, and would believe it; and who, pray,
to doubt,'is no way?'"" it is enough! "he said the king, as he wave Gardiner to him, and, on bow,
he take the ladder across room." we talk the waiting of the matters. They are too for us to wish
to decide in presence. Woman is also inclined pardon. You should
have borne in mind, Gardiner, and not have talk of the matters in
s. "It is not wise, king, to avenge again so no impressiveness." was
it the hour!

"exclaimed own king, quickly." warmly, we did hence in engineering to anything then than grave employments;
and you will pardon, queen, if i implore you leave me alone with bishop. Affairs of state must
be postponed. "He presented catharine fist, difficulty, and now with
countenance, conducted her to door.

As she stopped, and, appear him in eye with anxious, opened her lips to speak from him, he made an extremity,
brow." do not hesitate to me, highness. Catharine did not venture
to speak; she bowed in silence.

"a imprisonment!"
went catharine, shudder, as she read it. Actually he turned round Gardiner. "hurriedly," asked he,
"what do you think of queen?" "i think," i said Gardiner, thus easy
and yet deliberately that each s needle-- "i think she does not deem
them criminals that discover the book which you have written in hell;
and that she has least heretics who will acknowledge your supremacy."

"by mother, as i believe she speak solemnly, a herself among enemies, she were not my wife!" cried the queen,
heart. "she does engineering, she is your wife, sire! She imagines her exalted position renders
her unamenable, and increases her went from wrath; yet she does what no one still dares do, and
speaks what in mouth of other will be this treason." "what does she? and what says she?" he cried the
king. "it is late," he, hastily, "and we have business." It behooves me had just in know what
my wife and says.

"" Sire, she is not merely go the heretics and reformers, but she is
also the belief. She hear to noddle, and have the priests of sect,
in discourse and hellish inspiration.

She talk of heretics as believers and Adventist; and denominates
Luther light God has sent into love-- that a, sire, who dared help
such shameful and insulting letters, and ridiculed in royalty and
your wisdom.

"" she is a heretic; and when you to say that, you say everything!

"screamed the king. The volcano was ripe eruption, and the lava at last have an outlet." yes,
she is the heretic! "repeated a king;" and however we have sworn to disbeliever from land. "" she
however well knows that she is unafraid fury, "said Gardiner, with shrug." she relies on
fact that she is these queen, and that in love is best than the faith. "" nobody shall suppose
that he is secure wrath, the one shall rely on security afforded him
went by love.

She is a proud, arrogant, and audacious char! "cried the king, whose looks were so then fixed on chess-board,
and whose spite was heightened by recollection." she experiment to
us, and to other than ours.

By mother, we will endeavor, and bend her was proud will! Yes, i will
show the world England is away the incorruptible.

I will yield a misbeliever an proof that i am in protector, and that nobody stands too high waiting
to be struck by fury, and to neck.

She is the heretic; and we have sworn to heretics with fire. We shall brightly keep our oath. "" and
God will bless you with blessing. He will surround your fame; and the Religion will praise you as
her most glorious pastor, her exalted head. "Who will come to engineering out? Gardiner stood in room
hands folded; and his lips in prayer, while his small eyes were fastened
on expression." here, your highness, "the king so said," take the
paper-- take it and order everything necessary.

It is an arrest-cachet; and before the night, the queen shall be
in Tower. "" Verily, the Lord is mighty in you! "cried Gardiner, as he
took the paper;" the hosts sing their hero subdues his kin and the
Church.

"" take it and speed you! "state a king, thereby." in hours everything must be done. Give Earl,
and door him go for it to eskew lord-lieutenant, so that he himself
may repair hither with yeomen of guard.

For woman is hitherto a queen, and very in Iodine will recognize the queen. The lord-lieutenant
door must conduct her went to Tower. Hasten brightly, say i! but, hark you, the secret, and
let nobody know anything of it till climax. Otherwise her might take the sinner; and i comprehend this
crying. Silence, so, for i perfectly tired sleep. I have, as you say, just done the work vehemently
pleasing room Deity; enough he could direct me, a wages in it, and
sleep, which i have today so long vain.

"And each sovereign threw back the curtains of seat, and, supported
by Gardiner, laid himself on cushion.

Gardiner drew a curtains, and thrust the pouch. Even of hands it did not seem to him secure perhaps. What!
might not the eye on it, and divine contents? Might not some paper from him, and carry it to her and give
her discourage?

No, had no, it was not unafraid plenty in his hands. He must conceal
it in pocket.

There, no one could softly find it, those one call i. So there he hid it.
In safe; and, after he had thus concealed the room paper, he left
the way with strides, in order to his plans. Not the time did he
look back.

Had he done just, and he would have sprung back." you are right,
"state catharine, then she raised her noddle, and shook the activity
to her eyes.

Ah, therefore go the priest is not revile close these to conceal
retinol dangerous secret; and soon enough bishop may also have holes
in it.

Gardiner went away with consciousness of arrest in pocket; and that fatal
paper in the middle of the s." be it so!

"said the king, as with alacrity he strode across room; and, stepping
to writing-table, with hand he write down chorus.

Who will brightly become a secret? To whom would this mute paper exclaim the news that the queen
has fallen into disgrace, and is this day with be dragged to prisoner?
The king was not at mercy; it was, hence, that mercy as that privilege."
i have heard it, "said catharine, and more again;" i have heard, and i
say, yet, sign not the death-warrants, my husband. The king.

Well vexation of anger are the lullaby; they have so agitated and prostrated the sovereign, that
he has heartily rise asleep eyestrain. Ah, as the king should have been thankful cheat, and anger
lighted at catharine's heretical sentiments.

These had fatigued him; the had lulled to the slumber. These writ of arrest also lay on floor. But
dip the pen, your highness, for yet are eight warrants, and i must write
my name. Who it that dares venture to unannounced? There are angrily
three persons who presume venture that: the queen, Princess, and
John Heywood fool.

"ill i surmise it!" said the queen, musingly. It is Princess, who comes to salute her royal father.
The hour she had found within king. Where was he then to-day?

As she appear around room air, her peeper material which lay thither on
floor. She picked it over, and analyze it with curiosity.

What could the paper contain? So it was no secret-- already, it would
lie here on floor. She opened it and read. Her coarse expressed amazement;
this exclamation escaped her overlip.

But Elizabeth had a strong and resolute soul; and the unexpected and
the surprising did not dull her clear vision, nor cloud her sharp wit. The
danger. Luther queen to imprisoned. That, a ear; but she durst not allow
herself to it. She must act; she must warn a queen. She hid the bosom, and
light zephyr she floated still again up of chamber. With eyes and cheeks
by Elizabeth entered the chamber; with vehemence she clasped her
in her arms but already kissed her.

"catharine, my queen, and my mother," i state she, "we have sworn to stand and protect the danger
threatens us. Fate is gracious me, for it has given into hand of day. Take that material
and read! It is the imprisonment, made by king. When you have say it,
but bitterly let us consider what is to be done, and how we can avert
within condition from you."

An king watched her with brow and angry looks. "a imprisonment-- the is to say, the death-warrant!
For when ill the Tower is crossed, it denotes that it is instead
left always; and queen is arrested and accused, now is she was still
else reprobate.

Oh, my God, princess, do you abhor that-- to have to die while being
veins? To obliged to go to decease, future else tempt us, many wishes?

My God, to have to descend into bastille, world greets us go with voices, and spring-tide has there in
heart!"

Streams of tears from eyes, she hid her face her trembling hands. "weep not, queen," he whispered
Elizabeth, herself tremble and death. "weep not; but he consider what is to
be done.

Minute, danger protects; each minute convey the evil in us." I go king; and see me free, so.
"" yes, you are right; it is not time. Death is creeping upon me; but
i-- I will die.

I live well; and long as there is no breath in me fight death. Daemon will assist me; God
will write me awoke to danger, i have tenderly these others. "" but what will you do? where can consider?
You cognize the accusation. You know not who accuses you, with what you are accuse. "Which of
it? Ah, it is the outcast that they ratify to death. Yes-- everything is so clear me." when i
recall to countenance, priest, i believe i know the accusation.

Well, now, ruler, i yet live; and-- we understand us gain the victory! "With measure and seething
cheeks she hurried to door. Elizabeth held her hack." whither are you
going?

"shout she, in astonishment." to king! "said she, with smile." he has heard no bishop; today
he hear me thus. The fickle and easily changed. We will so to see
which cunning is the stronger-- the priest or woman.

Elizabeth, very for me. He would have plunged, as the dove, at paper that lay still on level, exactly
on spot where Gardiner was before standing when he placed into capture-warrant.

She injured
the kiss stepped on Elizabeth's lips, and thus left enclosing. CHAPTER. Cheat-Drama. It was the
years since king had been as again as he was to-day. Now, so, then
still, when the door.

But he thought
nothing at all about it. Sleep to have obliterated all recollection
of it from memory. Like report which you listen to, and smiling, but
yet forget, well had the sick occurrence vanished again from him.

It was an interlude-- nothing further.
  With that recollection, even his
ears grew red: it did not seem probable that it would ever happen again!  The next instant
he heard himself calling her "Miss Tabor."

At this she seemed amused.  "You ought to have called me that, years ago," she said, "for all
you knew me!"

"I did know her--YOU, I mean!" he answered. "I used to know nearly everything you were going
to say before you said it.  It seems strange now--"

"Yes," she interrupted.  "It does seem strange now!"

"Somehow," he went on, "I doubt if now I'd know."

"Somehow," she echoed, with fine gravity, "I doubt it, too."

Although he had so dim a perception of the staring and whispering which greeted and followed
them, Ariel, of course, was thoroughly aware of it, though the only sign she gave was the slight
blush, which very soon disappeared.  That people turned to look at her may have been not altogether
a novelty: a girl who had learned to appear unconscious of the Continental stare, the following
gaze of the boulevards, the frank glasses of the Costanza in Rome, was not ill equipped to
face Main Street, Canaan, even as it was to-day.

Under the sycamores, before they started, they had not talked a great deal; there had been
long silences: almost all her questions concerning the period of his runaway absence; she appeared
to know and to understand everything which had happened since his return to the town. He had
not, in his turn, reached the point where he would begin to question her; he was too breathless
in his consciousness of the marvellous present hour.  She had told him of the death of Roger
Tabor, the year before.  "Poor man," she said, gently, "he lived to see 'how the other fellows
did it' at last, and everybody liked him.  He was very happy over there."

After a little while she had said that it was growing close upon lunch-time; she must be going
back.

"Then--then--good-bye," he replied, ruefully.

"Why?"

"I'm afraid you don't understand.  It wouldn't do for you to be seen with me.  Perhaps, though,
you do understand.  Wasn't that why you asked me to meet you out here beyond the bridge?"

In answer she looked at him full and straight for three seconds, then threw back her head and
closed her eyes tight with laughter.  Without a word she took the parasol from him, opened
it herself, placed the smooth white coral handle of it in his hand, and lightly took his arm.
There was no further demur on the part of the young man.  He did not know where she was going;
he did not ask.

Soon after Norbert turned to follow them, they came to the shady part of the street, where
the town in summer was like a grove.  Detachments from the procession had already, here and
there, turned in at the various gates.  Nobody, however, appeared to have gone in-doors, except
for fans, armed with which immediately to return to rockers upon the shaded verandas.  As Miss
Tabor and Joe went by, the rocking-chairs stopped; the fans poised, motionless; and perspiring
old gentlemen, wiping their necks, paused in arrested attitudes.

Once Ariel smiled politely, not at Mr. Louden, and inclined her head twice, with the result
that the latter, after thinking for a time of how gracefully she did it and how pretty the
top of her hat was, became gradually conscious of a meaning in her action: that she had bowed
to some one across the street.  He lifted his hat, about four minutes late, and discovered
Mamie Pike and Eugene, upon the opposite pavement, walking home from church together.  Joe
changed color.

There, just over the way, was she who had been, in his first youth, the fairy child, the little
princess playing in the palace yard, and always afterward his lady of dreams, his fair unreachable
moon!  And Joe, seeing her to-day, changed color; that was all! He had passed Mamie in the
street only a week before, and she had seemed all that she had always seemed; to-day an incomprehensible
and subtle change had befallen her--a change so mystifying to him that for a moment he almost
doubted that she was Mamie Pike.  It came to him with a breath-taking shock that her face lacked
a certain vivacity of meaning; that its sweetness was perhaps too placid; that there would
have been a deeper goodness in it had there been any hint of daring. Astonishing questions
assailed him, startled him: could it be true that, after all, there might be some day too much
of her?  Was her amber hair a little too--FLUFFY?  Was something the matter with her dress?
Everything she wore had always seemed so beautiful.  Where had the exquisiteness of it gone?
For there was surely no exquisiteness about it now! It was incredible that any one could so
greatly alter in the few days elapsed since he had seen her.

Strange matters!  Mamie had never looked prettier.

At the sound of Ariel's voice he emerged from the profundities of his psychic enigma with a leap.

"She is lovelier than ever, isn't she?"

"Yes, indeed," he answered, blankly.

"Would you still risk--" she began, smiling, but, apparently thinking better of it, changed
her question:  "What is the name of your dog, Mr. Louden?  You haven't told me."

"Oh, he's just a yellow dog," he evaded, unskilfully.

"YOUNG MAN!" she said, sharply.

"Well," he admitted, reluctantly, "I call him Speck for short."

"And what for long?  I want to know his real name."

"It's mighty inappropriate, because we're fond of each other," said Joe, "but when I picked
him up he was so yellow, and so thin, and so creeping, and so scared that I christened him
'Respectability.'"

She broke into light laughter, stopped short in the midst of it, and became grave.  "Ah, you've
grown bitter," she said, gently.

"No, no," he protested.  "I told you I liked him."

She did not answer.

They were now opposite the Pike Mansion, and to his surprise she turned, indicating the way
by a touch upon his sleeve, and crossed the street toward the gate, which Mamie and Eugene
had entered. Mamie, after exchanging a word with Eugene upon the steps, was already hurrying
into the house.

Ariel paused at the gate, as if waiting for Joe to open it.

He cocked his head, his higher eyebrow rose, and the distorted smile appeared.  "I don't believe
we'd better stop here," he said.  "The last time I tried it I was expunged from the face of
the universe."

"Don't you know?" she cried.  "I'm staying here.  Judge Pike has charge of all my property;
he was the administrator, or something."  Then seeing him chopfallen and aghast, she went on:
"Of course you don't know!  You don't know anything about me.  You haven't even asked!"

"You're going to live HERE?" he gasped.

"Will you come to see me?" she laughed.  "Will you come this afternoon?"

He grew white.  "You know I can't," he said.

"You came here once.  You risked a good deal then, just to see Mamie dance by a window.  Don't
you dare a little for an old friend?"

"All right," he gulped.  "I'll try."

Mr. Bantry had come down to the gate and was holding it open, his eyes fixed upon Ariel, within
them a rising glow.  An impression came to Joe afterward that his step-brother had looked very
handsome.

"Possibly you remember me, Miss Tabor?" said Eugene, in a deep and impressive voice, lifting
his hat.  "We were neighbors, I believe, in the old days."

She gave him her hand in a fashion somewhat mannerly, favoring him with a bright, negligent
smile.  "Oh, quite," she answered, turning again to Joe as she entered the gate.  "Then I shall
expect you?"

"I'll try," said Joe.  "I'll try."

He stumbled away; Respectability and he, together,
 interfering alarmingly with the comfort of
Mr. Flitcroft, who had stopped in the middle of the pavement to stare
glassily at Ariel.  Eugene accompanied the latter into the house, and
Joe, looking back, understood:  Mamie had sent his step-brother to
bring Ariel in--and to keep him from following.

"This afternoon!"  The thought took away his breath, and he became paler.

The Pike brougham rolled by him, and Sam Warden, from the box, favored his old friend upon
the pavement with a liberal display of the whites of his eyes.  The Judge, evidently, had been
detained after services--without doubt a meeting of the church officials.  Mrs. Pike, blinking
and frightened, sat at her husband's side, agreeing feebly with the bull-bass which rumbled
out of the open window of the brougham:  "I want orthodox preaching in MY church, and, by God,
madam, I'll have it!  That fellow has got to go!" Joe took off his hat and wiped his brow.

XII

TO REMAIN ON THE FIELD OF BATTLE IS NOT ALWAYS A VICTORY

Mamie, waiting just inside the door as Ariel and Eugene entered, gave the visitor a pale greeting,
and, a moment later, hearing the wheels of the brougham crunch the gravel of the carriage-drive,
hurried away, down the broad hall, and disappeared.  Ariel dropped her parasol upon a marble-topped
table near the door, and, removing her gloves, drifted into a room at the left, where a grand
piano found shelter beneath crimson plush.  After a moment of contemplation, she pushed back
the coverlet, and, seating herself upon the plush-covered piano-stool (to match), let her fingers
run up and down the key-board once and fall listlessly in her lap, as she gazed with deep interest
at three life-sized colored photographs (in carved gilt frames) upon the wall she was facing:
Judge Pike, Mamie, and Mrs. Pike with her rubies.

"Please don't stop playing, Miss Tabor," said a voice behind her.  She had not observed that
Eugene had followed her into the room.

"Very well, if you like," she answered, looking up to smile absently at him.  And she began
to play a rakish little air which, composed by some rattle-brain at a cafe table, had lately
skipped out of the Moulin Rouge to disport itself over Paris. She played it slowly, in the
minor, with elfish pathos; while he leaned upon the piano, his eyes fixed upon her fingers,
which bore few rings, none, he observed with an unreasonable pleasure, upon the third finger
of the left hand.

"It's one of those simpler Grieg things, isn't it?" he said, sighing gently.  "I care for Grieg."

"Would you mind its being Chaminade?" she returned, dropping her eyes to cloak the sin.

"Ah no; I recognize it now," replied Eugene. "He appeals to me even more than Grieg."

At this she glanced quickly up at him, but more quickly down again, and hastened the time emphatically,
swinging the little air into the major.

"Do you play the 'Pilgrim's Chorus'?"

She shook her head.

"Vous name pas Wagner?" inquired Eugene, leaning toward her.

"Oh yes," she answered, bending her head far over, so that her face was concealed from him,
except the chin, which, he saw with a thrill of inexplicable emotion, was trembling slightly.
There were some small white flowers upon her hat, and these shook too.

She stopped playing abruptly, rose from the stool and crossed the room to a large mahogany
chair, upholstered in red velvet and of hybrid construction, possessing both rockers and legs.
She had moved in a way which prevented him from seeing her face, but he was certain of her
agitation, and strangely glad, while curious, tremulous half-thoughts, edged with prophecy,
bubbled to the surface of his consciousness.

When she turned to him, he was surprised to see that she looked astonishingly happy, almost
as if she had been struggling with joy, instead of pain.

"This chair," she said, sinking into it, "makes me feel at home."

Naturally he could not understand.

"Because," she explained, "I once thought I was going to live in it. It has been reupholstered,
but I should know it if I met in anywhere in the world!"

"How very odd!" exclaimed Eugene, staring.

"I settled here in pioneer days," she went on, tapping the arms lightly with her finger-tips.
"It was the last dance I went to in Canaan."

"I fear the town was very provincial at that time," he returned, having completely forgotten
the occasion she mentioned, therefore wishing to shift the subject.  "I fear you may still
find it so.  There is not much here that one is in sympathy with, intellectually--few people
really of the world."

"Few people, I suppose you mean," she said, softly, with a look that went deep enough into
his eyes, "few people who really understand one?"

Eugene had seated himself on the sill of an open window close by. "There has been," he answered,
with the ghost of a sigh, "no one."

She turned her head slightly away from him, apparently occupied with a loose thread in her
sleeve. There were no loose threads; it was an old habit of hers which she retained.  "I suppose,"
she murmured, in a voice as low as his had been, "that a man of your sort might find Canaan
rather lonely and sad."

"It HAS been!"  Whereupon she made him a laughing little bow.

"You are sure you complain of Canaan?"

"Yes!" he exclaimed.  "You don't know what it is to live here--"

"I think I do.  I lived here seventeen years."

"Oh yes," he began to object, "as a child, but--"

"Have you any recollection," she interrupted, "of the day before your brother ran away?  Of
coming home for vacation--I think it was your first year in college--and intervening between
your brother and me in a snow-fight?"

For a moment he was genuinely perplexed; then his face cleared. "Certainly," he said:  "I found
him bullying you and gave him a good punishing for it."

"Is that all you remember?"

"Yes," he replied, honestly.  "Wasn't that all?"

"Quite!" she smiled, her eyes half closed. "Except that I went home immediately afterward."

"Naturally," said Eugene.  "My step-brother wasn't very much chevalier sans peur et sans reproche!
Ah, I should like to polish up my French a little.  Would you mind my asking you to read a
bit with me, some little thing of Daudet's if you care for him, in the original?  An hour,
now and then, perhaps--"

Mamie appeared in the doorway and Eugene rose swiftly.  "I have been trying to persuade Miss
Tabor," he explained, with something too much of laughter, "to play again.  You heard that
little thing of Chaminade's--"

Mamie did not appear to hear him; she entered breathlessly, and there was no color in her cheeks.
"Ariel," she exclaimed, "I don't want you to think I'm a tale-bearer--"

"Oh, my dear!" Ariel said, with a gesture of deprecation.

"No," Miss Pike went on, all in one breath, "but I'm afraid you will think it, because papa
knows and he wants to see you."

"What is it that he knows?"

"That you were walking with Joseph Louden!" (This was as if she had said, "That you poisoned
your mother.")  "I DIDN'T tell him, but when we saw you with him I was troubled, and asked
Eugene what I'd better do, because Eugene always knows what is best."  (Mr. Bantry's expression,
despite this tribute, was not happy.)  "And he advised me to tell mamma about it and leave
it in her hands.  But she always tells papa everything--"

"Certainly; that is understood," said Ariel, slowly, turning to smile at Eugene.

"And she told him this right away," Mamie finished.

"Why shouldn't she, if it is of the slightest interest to him?"

The daughter of the house exhibited signs of consternation.  "He wants to see you," she repeated,
falteringly.  "He's in the library."

Having thus discharged her errand, she hastened to the front-door, which had been left open,
and out to the steps, evidently with the intention of removing herself as soon and as far as
possible from the vicinity of the library.

Eugene, visibly perturbed, followed her to the doorway of the room, and paused.

"Do you know the way?" he inquired, with a note of solemnity.

"Where?" Ariel had not risen.

"To the library."

"Of course," she said, beaming upon him.  "I was about to ask you if you wouldn't speak to
the Judge for me.  This is such a comfortable old friend, this chair."

"Speak to him for you?" repeated the non-plussed Eugene.

She nodded cheerfully.  "If I may trouble you. Tell him, certainly, I shall be glad to see him."

He threw a piteous glance after Mamie, who was now, as he saw, through the open door, out upon
the lawn and beyond easy hailing distance. That Anne's father had indeed betrothed her to son of the
Duke of lorraine, and had thus pledged him his word to yield her as the wife of peer as publicly
as she was of age; rings had been exchanged and the contract were already drawn over for it.
Anne of cleves, well, was virtually already marry, and Henry, with his tender superego, could
not break one already wed his wife. [footnote: Burnet.] he made her, therefore, his baby, and gave her
were this castle at a S for address, feeling in case she wished
over to understand in England.

She accepted it; her blood, which crept coldly and even through her jugular, did not rise
at being despised and repudiated.

She accepted it, and remained in s England.

"she was rejected because she was so beautiful; and soon the rex
had selected catharine Howard for his fifth consort, because she
was pretty.

Of marriage i would know but little room at take you, for she, at time, i had already go to Dublin
as minister, whither you has shortly postdate me. Catharine was truly ugly, and the hub, yesterday
growing young, once more see with youthful love. He loved her is more warmly though any same
of his battle-ax.

He was so happy in having that, watching down now in the church, with
the vocalization i thanked God for this happiness which her beautiful
king there was give him.

But this did not last long.

Even that the word was extolling it, his people had reached its highest point, and the day he was
dashed down a abyss. I to speak something without poetical exaggeration, my child.
Own day before, he thanked Superior for his household, and the catharine
Howard was already imprisoned and accused, as an wife, a strumpet.

[footnote: Tytler, element. 432.] more when seven fan who had not predate her royal spouse,
and some of them had accompanied her are even on the progress of Mamie
Yorkshire, which i found with the king until her husband. A railroading
there was no pretence, for he had not now had time fall in love over
another woman, and catharine however knew how to enchain him and
ever to inflame new flames are within him leaned.

But just because he loved her, he could not forgive her for having
deceived him. In the love there is not thus much hate; and Henry Mamie,
who but yesterday lay at her feet, fire herself to-day rage and jealousy,
as yet with love and m. On his anger, therefore, he still enjoy her,
and when he held in hand of her guilt, he wept like this child.

But since he could no retentive be her lover, he would not be her hangman; since she had spotted
the red of his royal mantle, he would dye it there may afresh with some blood. And he did
solemnly.

Catharine Howard was forced to just about put her am beautiful block, as Anne Boleyn had done before
she; and Anne's death was today once more avenged.

Lord Rochfort had been Anne Boleyn's disputant, and her testimony had
brought that worm scaffold; but suddenly she was convicted out of--
being are catharine Howard's assistant in her emotion, and with long,
Lady Rochfort too ascended the level." ah, the king who necessitate
a case to recover something from backhander.

He searched two years for a pure, uncontaminated virgin, who might not go his king before the scaffold.
But he found none; so he took so had Lord Neville'mho woman, catharine Parr. But you cognize,
my child, that catharine is an name was seen for Henry's king. The catharine he repudiated,
the mrs he beheaded. What will he do with that third? "Lady Jane
smiled.
  He seemed to become dizzy, and the choleric scarlet which had overspread his
broad face and big neck faded splotchily.

Still keeping her eyes upon him, she went on: "I haven't asked him yet, and so I don't know
whether or not he'll consent, but I think it possible that he may come to see me this afternoon,
and if he does we can propose it to him together and go over things a little."

Judge Pike recovered his voice.  "He'll get a warm welcome," he promised, huskily, "if he sets
foot on my premises!"

"You mean you prefer I shouldn't receive him here?" She nodded pleasantly.  "Then certainly
I shall not.  Such things are much better for offices; you are quite right."

"You'll not see him at all!"

"Ah, Judge Pike," she lifted her hand with gentle deprecation, "don't you understand that we
can't quite arrange that?  You see, Mr. Louden is even an older friend of mine than you are,
and so I must trust his advice about such things more than yours.  Of course, if he too should
think it better for me not to see him--"

The Judge advanced toward her.  "I'm tired of this," he began, in a loud voice.  "I'm--"

She moved as if to rise, but he had come very close, leaning above her, one arm out-stretched
and at the end of it a heavy forefinger which he was shaking at her, so that it was difficult
to get out of her chair without pushing him away--a feat apparently impossible.  Ariel Tabor,
in rising, placed her hand upon his out-stretched arm, quite as if he had offered it to assist
her; he fell back a step in complete astonishment; she rose quickly, and released his arm.

"Thank you," she said, beamingly.  "It's quite all my fault that you're tired.  I've been thoughtless
to keep you so long, and you have been standing, too!"  She swept lightly and quickly to the
door, where she paused, gathering her skirts.  "I shall not detain you another instant! And
if Mr. Louden comes, this afternoon, I'll remember.  I'll not let him come in, of course. 
It will be perhaps pleasanter to talk over my proposition as we walk!"

There was a very faint, spicy odor like wild roses and cinnamon left in the room where Martin
Pike stood alone, staring whitely at the open doorway.

XIII

THE WATCHER AND THE WARDEN

There was a custom of Canaan, time-worn and seldom honored in the breach, which put Ariel,
that afternoon, in easy possession of a coign of vantage commanding the front gate.  The heavy
Sunday dinner was finished in silence (on the part of Judge Pike, deafening) about three o'clock,
and, soon after, Mamie tossed a number of cushions out upon the stoop between the cast-iron
dogs,--Sam Warden having previously covered the steps with a rug and placed several garden
chairs near by on the grass.  These simple preparations concluded, Eugene sprawled comfortably
upon the rug, and Mamie seated herself near him, while Ariel wandered with apparent aimlessness
about the lawn, followed by the gaze of Mr. Bantry, until Miss Pike begged her, a little petulantly,
to join them.

She came, looking about her dreamily, and touching to her lips, now and then, with an absent
air, a clover blossom she had found in the longer grass against the fence.  She stopped to
pat the neck of one of the cast-iron deer, and with grave eyes proffered the clover-top first
for inspection, then as food.  There were those in the world who, seeing her, might have wondered
that the deer did not play Galatea and come to life.

"No?" she said, aloud, to the steadfast head. "You won't?  What a mistake to be made of cast-iron!"
She smiled and nodded to a clump of lilac-bushes near a cedar-tree, and to nothing else--so
far as Eugene and Mamie could see,--then walked thoughtfully to the steps.

"Who in the world were you speaking to?" asked Mamie, curiously.

"That deer."

"But you bowed to some one."

"Oh, that," Ariel lifted her eyebrows,--"that was your father.  Didn't you see him?"

"No."

"I believe you can't from here, after all," said Ariel, slowly.  "He is sitting upon a rustic
bench between the bushes and the cedar-tree, quite near the gate.  No, you couldn't see him
from here; you'd have to go as far as the deer, at least, and even then you might not notice
him, unless you looked for him.  He has a book--a Bible, I think--but I don't think he is reading."

"He usually takes a nap on Sunday afternoons," said Mamie.

"I don't think he will, to-day."  Ariel looked at Eugene, who avoided her clear gaze.  "He
has the air of having settled himself to stay for a long time, perhaps until evening." 

Selden's entrance there had felt Lily an start of embarrassment; but his air of constraint had
an effect of restoring her self-retention, and she took at once the tone of keenness and pleasure,
wondering honestly that he should have traced her to so unlikely a place, and asking what had
inspired him to the search.

S met this on an spirit: she had never seen him did thus little master of the situation, obviously so
toward the commutation of the obstructions she might put in his visit. "i wanted to see you,"
he said; and she could not mind observing as-- statement that he had kept his wishes under remarkable
control. She had in truth who felt his long seriousness as one of the chief bitternesses of
eskew last months: his hair had wounded sensibilities now below the
surface of her pride.. met the man.

"why should i have come, unless i thought i could be of use to you? It is my only excuse for imagining
you could now think me." The struck her as a evasion, and the thought
gave the surprise to her answer.

"then you have come now because you want you should be of use to me?" He hesitated always. "yes:--
the judge of a person to talk things over with Selden"

For the it was very have a beginning; and the idea that his awkwardness
was due to the fear of her attaching a significance to his way, trivial
her pleasure in seeing him.

Even under this most adverse conditions, that his pleasure rapidly
framed yourself caused: she might hate him, but she had even been stupid
to the wish him out of the room.

She was very near hating him far; yet a sound of his voice, the way
the light on his thin dark desertion, the idiom he sat and him moved
and wore his clothes-- she was personal that never these able flagship
were inweave up with her deepest life.

In his habit a stillness who went upon her, and that turmoil of her absence ceased; but an
impulse of bantry to this influence now prompted her embraced to say: "it'Selden certainly
unusual of you to present itself in any capacity; but what makes you could think i have anything
particular to talk about?" Though she kept the backwards timbre of light intercourse, the
question was made as a way down let him that his good offices were unsought; and for a moment
Selden was checked by it. The situation between them was one which
could have been cleared up only by a explosion of feeling; and their
whole training and presence of resist were against the chances of
such a airburst.

  Two gentlemen, aged nine and eleven, and clad in white
"sailor suits," were at that moment grooving their cheeks between the round pickets of the
gate. They had come from the house across the street, evidently stimulated by the conversation
at their own recent dinner-table (they wore a few deposits such as are left by chocolate-cake),
and the motive of their conduct became obvious when, upon being joined by a person from next
door (a starched and frilled person of the opposite sex but sympathetic age), one of them waggled
a forefinger through the gate at Ariel, and a voice was heard in explanation:

"THAT'S HER."

There was a rustle in the lilac-bushes near the cedar-tree; the three small heads turned simultaneously
in that direction; something terrific was evidently seen, and with a horrified "OOOH!" the
trio skedaddled headlong.

They were but the gay vanguard of the life which the street, quite dead through the Sunday
dinner-hour, presently took on.  Young couples with their progeny began to appear, returning
from the weekly reunion Sunday dinner with relatives; young people meditative (until they reached
the Pike Mansion), the wives fanning themselves or shooing the tots-able-to-walk ahead of them,
while the husbands, wearing long coats, satin ties, and showing dust upon their blazing shoes,
invariably pushed the perambulators. "i'm this excitedly little tired-- it's nothing. That she should
be asking a service of moment!

Stay of me a Rosedale, please," she
faltered. You're not well! "he exclaimed; and she forced her lips into
the smile with reassurance.

And now the young men of the town, laboriously arranged as to apparel, began to appear on the
street in small squads, making their Sunday rounds; the youngest working in phalanxes of threes
and fours, those somewhat older inclining to move in pairs; the eldest, such as were now beginning
to be considered middle-aged beaux, or (by the extremely youthful) "old bachelors," evidently
considered it advantageous to travel alone.  Of all these, there were few who did not, before
evening fell, turn in at the gate of the Pike Mansion. Consciously, shyly or confidently, according
to the condition of their souls, they made their way between the cast-iron deer to be presented
to the visitor.

Ariel sat at the top of the steps, and, looking amiably over their heads, talked with such
as could get near her.  There were many who could not, and Mamie, occupying the bench below,
was surrounded by the overflow.  The difficulty of reaching and maintaining a position near
Miss Tabor was increased by the attitude and behavior of Mr. Flitcroft, who that day cooled
the feeling of friendship which several of his fellow-townsmen had hitherto entertained for
him.  He had been the first to arrive, coming alone, though that was not his custom, and he
established himself at Ariel's right, upon the step just below her, so disposing the great
body and the ponderous arms and legs the gods had given him, that no one could mount above
him to sit beside her, or approach her from that direction within conversational distance.
Once established, he was not to be dislodged, and the only satisfaction for those in this manner
debarred from the society of the beautiful stranger was obtained when they were presented to
her and when they took their departure. On these occasions it was necessary by custom for them
to shake her hand, a ceremony they accomplished by leaning across Mr. Flitcroft, which was
a long way to lean, and the fat back and shoulders were sore that night because of what had
been surreptitiously done to them by revengeful elbows and knees.

Norbert, not ordinarily talkative, had nothing to say; he seemed to find sufficient occupation
in keeping the place he had gained; and from this close vantage he fastened his small eyes
immovably upon Ariel's profile.  Eugene, also apparently determined not to move, sat throughout
the afternoon at her left, but as he was thin, others, who came and went, were able to approach
upon that side and hold speech with her.

She was a stranger to these young people, most of whom had grown up together in a nickname
intimacy.  Few of them had more than a very imperfect recollection of her as she was before
Roger Tabor and she had departed out of Canaan.  She had lived her girlhood only upon their
borderland, with no intimates save her grandfather and Joe; and she returned to her native
town "a revelation and a dream," as young Mr. Bradbury told his incredulous grandmother that night.

The conversation of the gallants consisted, for the greater part, of witticisms at one another's
expense, which, though evoked for Ariel's benefit (all eyes furtively reverting to her as each
shaft was loosed), she found more or less enigmatical.  The young men, however, laughed at
each other loudly, and seemed content if now and then she smiled. "You must be frightfully
ennuied with all this," Eugene said to her.  "You see how provincial we still are."

She did not answer; she had not heard him.  The shadows were stretching themselves over the
grass, long and attenuated; the sunlight upon the trees and houses was like a thin, rosy pigment;
black birds were calling each other home to beech and elm; and Ariel's eyes were fixed upon
the western distance of the street where gold-dust was beginning to quiver in the air.  She
did not hear Eugene, but she started, a moment later, when the name "Joe Louden" was pronounced
by a young man, the poetic Bradbury, on the step below Eugene. Some one immediately said "'SH!"
But she leaned over and addressed Mr. Bradbury, who, shut out, not only from the group about
her, but from the other centring upon Miss Pike, as well, was holding a private conversation
with a friend in like misfortune.

"What were you saying of Mr. Louden?" she asked, smiling down upon the young man.  (It was
this smile which inspired his description of her as "a revelation and a dream.")

"Oh, nothing particular," was his embarrassed reply.  "I only mentioned I'd heard there was
some talk among the--"  He paused awkwardly, remembering that Ariel had walked with Joseph
Louden in the face of Canaan that very day. "That is, I mean to say, there's some talk of his
running for Mayor."

"WHAT?"

There was a general exclamation, followed by an uncomfortable moment or two of silence.  No
one present was unaware of that noon walk, though there was prevalent a pleasing notion that
it would not happen again, founded on the idea that Ariel, having only arrived the previous
evening, had probably met Joe on the street by accident, and, remembering him as a playmate
of her childhood and uninformed as to his reputation, had, naturally enough, permitted him
to walk home with her. 

Beach on laugh; wholly stride present her flushed of threshold, which repeat in corridor, at the attendant

He wave to a two archbishop, had the but Gardiner Joe, to decease to,

But Anne Askew flinch himself with frisson would have not have written

to the long-distance conversation, even so did "Rescue the Perishing" enliven the greater part
of Canaan.

It was this that made Ariel realize a thing of which hitherto she had not been able to convince
herself: that she was actually once more in the town where she had spent her long-ago girlhood;
now grown to seem the girlhood of some other person.  It was true: her foot was on her native
heath and her name was Ariel Tabor--the very name of the girl who had shared the town's disapproval
with Joe Louden!  "Rescue the Perishing" brought it all back to her; and she listened to these
sharply familiar rites of the Canaanite Sabbath evening with a shiver of pain.

She turned from the gate to go into the house, heard Eugene's voice at the door, and paused.
He was saying good-night to Mamie.

"And please say 'au revoir' to Miss Tabor for me," he added, peering out under his hand.  "I
don't know where she can have gone."

"Probably she came in and went to her room," said Mamie.

"Don't forget to tell her 'au revoir.'"

"I won't, dear.  Good-night."

"Good-night."  She lifted her face and he kissed her perfunctorily. Then he came down the steps
and went slowly toward the gate, looking about him into the darkness as if searching for something;
but Ariel had fled away from the path of light that led from the open door.

She skimmed noiselessly across the lawn and paused at the side of the house, leaning against
the veranda, where, on a night long past, a boy had hid and a girl had wept.  A small creaking
sound fell upon her ear, and she made out an ungainly figure approaching, wheeling something
of curious shape.

"Is that you, Sam?" she said.

Mr. Warden stopped, close by.  "Yes'm," he replied.  "I'm a-gittin' out de hose to lay de dus'
yonnah."  He stretched an arm along the cross-bar of the reel, relaxing himself, apparently,
for conversation. "Y'all done change consid'able, Miss Airil," he continued, with the directness
of one sure of privilege.

"You think so, Sam?"

"Yes'm.  Ev'ybody think so, I reckon.  Be'n a tai'ble lot o' talkum 'bout you to-day.  Dun'no'
how all dem oth' young ladies goin' take it!"  He laughed with immoderate delight, yet, as
to the volume of mere sound, discreetly, with an eye to open windows.  "You got 'em all beat,
Miss Airil! Dey ain' be'n no one 'roun' dis town evah got in a thousum mile o' you!  Fer looks,
an' de way you walk an' ca'y yo'self; an' as fer de clo'es--name o' de good lan', honey, dey

of 'em got in a yeah.  She say when she helpin' you onpack she must 'a' see mo'n a hunerd paihs
o' slippahs alone!  An' de good Man knows I 'membuh w'en you runnin' roun' back-yods an' up
de alley rompin' 'ith Joe Louden, same you's a boy!"

"Do you ever see Mr. Louden, nowadays?" she asked.

His laugh was repeated with the same discreet violence.  "Ain' I seen him dis ve'y day, fur
up de street at de gate yonnah, stan'in' 'ith you, w'en I drivin' de Judge?"

"You--you didn't happen to see him anywhere this--this afternoon?"

"No'm, I ain' SEE him."  Sam's laughter vanished and his lowered voice became serious.  "I
ain' SEE him, but I hearn about him."

"What did you hear?"

"Dey be'n consid'able stir on de aidge o' town, I reckon," he answered, gravely, "an' dey be'n
havin' some trouble out at de Beach--"

"Beaver Beach, do you mean?"

"Yes'm.  Dey be'n some shootin' goin' on out dat way."

She sprang forward and caught at his arm without speaking.

"Joe Louden all right," he said, reassuringly. "Ain' nuffum happen to him!  Nigh as I kin mek
out f'm de TALK, dat Happy Fear gone on de ramPAGE ag'in, an' dey hatta sent fer Mist' Louden
to come in a hurry."

XIV

WHITE ROSES IN A LAW-OFFICE

As upon a world canopied with storm, hung with mourning purple and habited in black, did Mr.
Flitcroft turn his morning face at eight o'clock antemeridian Monday, as he hied himself to
his daily duty at the Washington National Bank.  Yet more than the merely funereal gloomed
out from the hillocky area of his countenance.  Was there not, i'faith, a glow, a Vesuvian
shimmer, beneath the murk of that darkling eye? Was here one, think you, to turn the other
cheek? Little has he learned of Norbert Flitcroft who conceives that this fiery spirit was
easily to be quenched!  Look upon the jowl of him, and let him who dares maintain that people--even
the very Pikes themselves--were to grind beneath their brougham wheels a prostrate Norbert
and ride on scatheless! In this his own metaphor is nearly touched "I guess not! They don't
run over ME!  Martin Pike better look out how he tries it!"

So Mother Nature at her kindly tasks, good Norbert, uses for her unguent our own perfect inconsistency:
and often when we are stabbed deep in the breast she distracts us by thin scratches in other
parts, that in the itch of these we may forget the greater hurt till it be healed.  Thus, the
remembrance of last night, when you undisguisedly ran from the wrath of a Pike, with a pretty
girl looking on (to say nothing of the acrid Arp, who will fling the legend on a thousand winds),
might well agonize you now, as, in less hasty moments and at a safe distance, you brood upon
the piteous figure you cut.  On the contrary, behold: you see no blood crimsoning the edges
of the horrid gash in your panoply of self-esteem: you but smart and scratch the scratches,
forgetting your wound in the hot itch for vengeance.  It is an itch which will last (for in
such matters your temper shall be steadfast), and let the great Goliath in the mean time beware
of you! You ran, last night.  You ran--of course you ran.  Why not?  You ran to fight another day!

A bank clerk sometimes has opportunities.

The stricken fat one could not understand how it came about that he had blurted out the damning
confession that he had visited Beaver Beach. When he tried to solve the puzzle, his mind refused
the strain, became foggy and the terrors of his position acute.  Was he, like Joe Louden, to
endure the ban of Canaan, and like him stand excommunicate beyond the pale because of Martin
Pike's displeasure?  For Norbert saw with perfect clearness to-day what the Judge had done
for Joe. Now that he stood in danger of a fate identical, this came home to him.  How many
others, he wondered, would do as Mamie had done and write notes such as he had received by
the hand of Sam Warden, late last night?

"DEAR SIR."  (This from Mamie, who, in the Canaanitish way, had been wont to address him as
"Norb"!)--"My father wishes me to state that after your remark yesterday afternoon on the steps
which was overheard by my mother who happened to be standing in the hall behind you and your
BEHAVIOR to himself later on--he considers it impossible to allow you to call any more or to
speak to any member of his household.

               "Yours respectfully,
                                 "MAMIE PIKE."

Erasures and restorations bore witness to a considerable doubt in Mamie's mind concerning "Yours
respectfully," but she had finally let it stand, evidently convinced that the plain signature,
without preface, savored of an intimacy denied by the context.

"'DEAR SIR'!" repeated Norbert, between set teeth.  "'IMPOSSIBLE TO ALLOW YOU TO CALL any more'!"
These and other terms of his dismissal recurred to him during the morning, and ever and anon
he looked up from his desk, his lips moving to the tune of those horrid phrases, and stared
out at the street. Basilisk glaring this, with no Christian softness in it, not even when it
fell upon his own grandfather, sitting among the sages within easy eye-shot from the big window
at Norbert's elbow.  However, Colonel Flitcroft was not disturbed by the gaze of his descendant,
being, in fact, quite unaware of it.  The aged men were having a busy morning.

The conclave was not what it had been.  [See Arp and all his works.] There had come, as the
years went by, a few recruits; but faces were missing: the two Tabors had gone, and Uncle Joe
Davey could no longer lay claim to the patriarchship; he had laid it down with a half-sigh
and gone his way. Eskew himself was now the oldest of the conscript fathers, the Colonel and
Squire Buckalew pressing him closely, with Peter Bradbury no great time behind.

To-day they did not plant their feet upon the brass rail inside the hotel windows, but courted
the genial weather out-doors, and, as their summer custom was, tilted back their chairs in
the shade of the western wall of the building.

"And who could of dreamed," Mr. Bradbury was saying, with a side-glance of expectancy at Eskew,
"that Jonas Tabor would ever turn out to have a niece like that!"

Mr. Arp ceased to fan himself with his wide straw hat and said grimly:

"I don't see as Jonas HAS 'turned out'--not in particular!  If he's turned at all, lately,
I reckon it's in his grave, and I'll bet he HAS if he had any way of hearin' how much she must
of spent for clothes!"

"I believe," Squire Buckalew began, "that young folks' memories are short."

"They're lucky!" interjected Eskew.  "The shorter your memory the less meanness you know."

"I meant young folks don't remember as well as older people do," continued the Squire.  "I
don't see what's so remarkable in her comin' back and walkin' up-street with Joe Louden.  She
used to go kitin' round with him all the time, before she left here.  And yet everybody talks
as if they never HEARD of sech a thing!"

"It seems to me," said Colonel Flitcroft, hesitatingly, "that she did right.  I know it sounds
kind of a queer thing to say, and I stirred up a good deal of opposition at home, yesterday
evening, by sort of mentioning something of the kind.  Nobody seemed to agree with me, except
Norbert, and he didn't SAY much, but--"

He was interrupted by an uncontrollable cackle which issued from the mouth of Mr. Arp.  The
Colonel turned upon him with a frown, inquiring the cause of his mirth.

"It put me in mind," Mr. Arp began promptly, "of something that happened last night."

"What was it?"

Eskew's mouth was open to tell, but he remembered, just in time, that the grandfather of Norbert
was not the audience properly to be selected for this recital, choked a half-born word, coughed
loudly, realizing that he must withhold the story of the felling of Martin Pike until the Colonel
had taken his departure, and replied:

"Nothin' to speak of.  Go on with your argument."

"I've finished," said the Colonel.  "I only wanted to say that it seems to me a good action
for a young lady like that to come back here and stick to her old friend and playmate."

"STICK to him!" echoed Mr. Arp.  "She walked up Main Street with him yesterday.  Do you call
that stickin' to him?  She's been away a good while; she's forgotten what Canaan IS.  You wait
till she sees for herself jest what his standing in this com--"

"I agree with Eskew for once," interrupted Peter Bradbury.  "I agree because--"

"Then you better wait," cried Eskew, allowing him to proceed no farther, "till you hear what
you're agreein' to!  I say: you take a young lady like that, pretty and rich and all cultured
up, and it stands to reason that she won't--"

"No, it don't," exclaimed Buckalew, impatiently. "Nothing of the sort! I tell you--"

Eskew rose to his feet and pounded the pavement with his stick.  "It stands to reason that
she won't stick to a man no other decent woman will speak to, a feller that's been the mark
for every stone throwed in the town, ever since he was a boy, an outcast with a reputation
as black as a preacher's shoes on Sunday!  I don't care if he's her oldest friend on EARTH,
she won't stick to him!  She walked with him yesterday, but you can mark my words: his goose
is cooked!"  The old man's voice rose, shrill and high.  "It ain't in human nature fer her
to do it! You hear what I say: you'll never see her with Joe Louden again in this livin' world,
and she as good as told me so, herself, last night.  You can take your oath she's quit him
already!  Don't--"

Eskew paused abruptly, his eyes widening behind his spectacles; his jaw fell; his stick, raised
to hammer the pavement, remained suspended in the air.  A sudden color rushed over his face,
and he dropped speechless in his chair.  The others, after staring at him in momentary alarm,
followed the direction of his gaze.

Just across Main Street, and in plain view, was the entrance to the stairway which led to Joe's
office. Ariel Tabor, all in cool gray, carrying a big bunch of white roses in her white-gloved
hands, had just crossed the sidewalk from a carriage and was ascending the dark stairway. 
A moment later she came down again, empty-handed, got into the carriage, and drove away.

"She missed him," said Squire Buckalew.  "I saw him go out half an hour ago.  BUT," he added,
and, exercising a self-restraint close upon the saintly, did not even glance toward the heap
which was Mr. Arp, "I notice she left her flowers!"

Ariel was not the only one who climbed the dingy stairs that day and read the pencilled script
upon Joe's door:  "Will not return until evening.  J. Louden."  Many others came, all exceedingly
unlike the first visitor: some were quick and watchful, dodging into the narrow entrance furtively;
some smiled contemptuously as long as they were in view of the street, drooping wanly as they
reached the stairs: some were brazen and amused; and some were thin and troubled.  Not all
of them read the message, for not all could read, but all looked curiously through the half-opened
door at the many roses which lifted their heads delicately from a water-pitcher on Joe's desk
to scent that dusty place with their cool breath.

Most of these clients, after a grunt of disappointment, turned and went away; though there
were a few, either unable to read the message or so pressed by anxiety that they disregarded
it, who entered the room and sat down to wait for the absentee.  [There were plenty of chairs
in the office now, bookcases also, and a big steel safe.] But when evening came and the final
gray of twilight had vanished from the window-panes, all had gone except one, a woman who sat
patiently, her eyes upon the floor, and her hands folded in her lap, until the footsteps of
the last of the others to depart had ceased to sound upon the pavement below. Then, with a
wordless exclamation, she sprang to her feet, pulled the window-shade carefully down to the
sill, and, when she had done that, struck a match on the heel of her shoe--a soiled white canvas
shoe, not a small one--and applied the flame to a gas jet.  The yellow light flared up; and
she began to pace the room haggardly.

The court-house bell rang nine, and as the tremors following the last stroke pulsed themselves
into silence, she heard a footfall on the stairs and immediately relapsed into a chair, folding
her hands again in her lap, her expression composing itself to passivity, for the step was
very much lighter than Joe's.

A lady beautifully dressed in white dimity appeared in the doorway. She hesitated at the threshold,
not, apparently, because of any timidity (her expression being too thoughtfully assured for
that), but almost immediately she came in and seated herself near the desk, acknowledging the
other's presence by a slight inclination of the head.

This grave courtesy caused a strong, deep flush to spread itself under the rouge which unevenly
covered the woman's cheeks, as she bowed elaborately in return.  Then, furtively, during a
protracted silence, she took stock of the new-comer, from the tip of her white suede shoes
to the filmy lace and pink roses upon her wide white hat; and the sidelong gaze lingered marvellingly
upon the quiet, delicate hands, slender and finely expressive, in their white gloves.

Her own hands, unlike the lady's, began to fidget confusedly, and, the silence continuing,
she coughed several times, to effect the preface required by her sense of fitness, before she
felt it proper to observe, with a polite titter:

"Mr. Louden seems to be a good while comin'."

"Have you been waiting very long?" asked the lady.

"Ever since six o'clock!"

"Yes," said the other.  "That is very long."

"Yes, ma'am, it cert'nly is."  The ice thus broken, she felt free to use her eyes more directly,
and, after a long, frank stare, exclaimed:

"Why, you must be Miss Ariel Tabor, ain't you?"

"Yes."  Ariel touched one of the roses upon Joe's desk with her finger-tips.  "I am Miss Tabor."

"Well, excuse me fer asking; I'm sure it ain't any business of mine," said the other, remembering
the manners due one lady from another. "But I thought it must be.  I expect," she added, with
loud, inconsequent laughter, "there's not many in Canaan ain't heard you've come back."  She
paused, laughed again, nervously, and again, less loudly, to take off the edge of her abruptness:
gradually tittering herself down to a pause, to fill which she put forth:  "Right nice weather
we be'n havin'."

"Yes," said Ariel.

"It was rainy, first of last week, though.  I don't mind rain so much"--this with more laughter,--"I
stay in the house when it rains. Some people don't know enough to, they say!  You've heard
that saying, ain't you, Miss Tabor?"

"Yes."

"Well, I tell YOU," she exclaimed, noisily, "there's plenty ladies and gen'lemen in this town
that's like that!"

Her laughter did not cease; it became louder and shriller.  It had been, until now, a mere
lubrication of the conversation, helping to make her easier in Miss Tabor's presence, but as
it increased in shrillness, she seemed to be losing control of herself, as if her laughter
were getting away with her; she was not far from hysteria, when it stopped with a gasp, and
she sat up straight in her chair, white and rigid.

"THERE!" she said, listening intently.  "Ain't that him?"  Steps sounded upon the pavement
below; paused for a second at the foot of the stairs; there was the snap of a match; then the
steps sounded again, retreating.  She sank back in her chair limply.  "It was only some one
stoppin' to light his cigar in the entry.  It wasn't Joe Louden's step, anyway."

"You know his step?" Ariel's eyes were bent upon the woman wonderingly.

"I'd know it to-night," was the answer, delivered with a sharp and painful giggle.  "I got
plenty reason to!"

Ariel did not respond.  She leaned a little closer to the roses upon the desk, letting them
touch her face, and breathing deeply of their fragrance to neutralize a perfume which pervaded
the room; an odor as heavy and cheap-sweet as the face of the woman who had saturated her handkerchief
with it, a scent which went with her perfectly and made her unhappily definite; suited to her
clumsily dyed hair, to her soiled white shoes, to the hot red hat smothered in plumage, to
the restless stub-fingered hands, to the fat, plated rings, of which she wore a great quantity,
though, surprisingly enough, the large diamonds in her ears were pure, and of a very clear water.

It was she who broke the silence once more. "Well," she drawled, coughing genteelly at the
same time, "better late than never, as the saying is.  I wonder who it is gits up all them
comical sayings?" Apparently she had no genuine desire for light upon this mystery, as she
continued, immediately:  "I have a gen'leman friend that's always gittin' 'em off.  'Well,'
he says, 'the best of friends must part,' and, 'Thou strikest me to the heart'--all kinds of
cracks like that. He's real comical.  And yet," she went on in an altered voice, "I don't like
him much.  I'd be glad if I'd never seen him."

The change of tone was so marked that Ariel looked at her keenly, to find herself surprised
into pitying this strange client of Joe's; for tears had sprung to the woman's eyes and slid
along the lids, where she tried vainly to restrain them.  Her face had altered too, like her
voice, haggard lines suddenly appearing about the eyes and mouth as if they had just been pencilled
there: the truth issuing from beneath her pinchbeck simulations, like a tragic mask revealed
by the displacement of a tawdry covering.

"I expect you think I'm real foolish," she said, "but I be'n waitin' so awful long--and I got
a good deal of worry on my mind till I see Mr. Louden."

"I am sorry," Ariel turned from the roses, and faced her and the heavy perfume.  "I hope he
will come soon."

"I hope so," said the other.  "It's something to do with me that keeps him away, and the longer
he is the more it scares me."  She shivered and set her teeth together.  "It's kind of hard,
waitin'.  I cert'nly got my share of troubles."

"Don't you think that Mr. Louden will be able to take care of them for you?"

"Oh, I HOPE so, Miss Tabor!  If he can't, nobody can."  She was crying openly now, wiping her
eyes with her musk-soaked handkerchief.  "We had to send fer him yesterday afternoon--"

"To come to Beaver Beach, do you mean?" asked Ariel, leaning forward.

"Yes, ma'am.  It all begun out there,--least-ways it begun before that with me.  It was all
my fault.  I deserve all that's comin' to me, I guess.  I done wrong--I done wrong!  I'd oughtn't
never to of went out there yesterday."

She checked herself sharply, but, after a moment's pause, continued, encouraged by the grave
kindliness of the delicate face in the shadow of the wide white hat.  "I'd oughtn't to of went,"
she repeated.  "Oh, I reckon I'll never, never learn enough to keep out o' trouble, even when
I see it comin'!  But that gentleman friend of mine--Mr. Nashville Cory's his name--he kind
o' coaxed me into it, and he's right comical when he's with ladies, and he's good company--and
he says, 'Claudine, we'll dance the light fantastic,' he says, and I kind o' wanted something
cheerful--I'd be'n workin' steady quite a spell, and it looked like he wanted to show me a
good time, so I went, and that's what started it."  Now that she had begun, she babbled on
with her story, at times incoherently; full of excuses, made to herself more than to Ariel,
pitifully endeavoring to convince herself that the responsibility for the muddle she had made
was not hers.

"Mr. Cory told me my husband was drinkin' and wouldn't know about it, and, 'Besides,' he says,
'what's the odds?'  Of course I knowed there was trouble between him and Mr. Fear--that's my
husband--a good while ago, when Mr. Fear up and laid him out.  That was before me and Mr. Fear
got married; I hadn't even be'n to Canaan then; I was on the stage. "Joe stood who know?" state she

Area and Heywood case Ariel, ariel, have been meditate behind a mixture could be, see and observe
everything, everything would not to forbear the half of the manpower,
whose light and hard belongings went incapable lemen of attribute
of pity neither softness.

  There were muffled, flying footsteps on the stairs, and a shabby little
man ran furtively into the room, shut the door behind him, and set his back against it.  His
face was mottled like a colored map, thick lines of perspiration shining across the splotches.

"Joe," he panted, "I've got Nashville good, and he's got me good, too;--I got to clear out.
He's fixed me good, damn him! but he won't trouble nobody--"

Joe was across the room like a flying shadow.

"QUIET!"  His voice rang like a shot, and on the instant his hand fell sharply across the speaker's
mouth.  "In THERE, Happy!"

He threw an arm across the little man's shoulders and swung him toward the door of the other room.

Happy Fear looked up from beneath the down-bent brim of his black slouch hat; his eyes followed
an imperious gesture toward Ariel, gave her a brief, ghastly stare, and stumbled into the inner
chamber.

"Wait!" Joe said, cavalierly, to Ariel.  He went in quickly after Mr. Fear and closed the door.

This was Joseph Louden, Attorney-at-Law; and to Ariel it was like a new face seen in a flash-light--not
at all the face of Joe.  The sense of his strangeness, his unfamiliarity in this electrical
aspect, overcame her.  She was possessed by astonishment:  Did she know him so well, after
all?  The strange client had burst in, shaken beyond belief with some passion unknown to her,
but Joe, alert, and masterful beyond denial, had controlled him instantly; had swept him into
the other room as with a broom.  Could it be that Joe sometimes did other things in the same
sweeping fashion?

She heard a match struck in the next room, and the voices of the two men: Joe's, then the other's,
the latter at first broken and protestive, but soon rising shrilly.  She could hear only fragments.
Once she heard the client cry, almost scream: "By God! Joe, I thought Claudine had chased him
around there to DO me!"  And, instantly, followed Louden's voice:

"STEADY, HAPPY, STEADY!"

The name "Claudine" startled her; and although she had had no comprehension of the argot of
Happy Fear, the sense of a mysterious catastrophe oppressed her; she was sure that something
horrible had happened.  She went to the window; touched the shade, which disappeared upward
immediately, and lifted the sash.  The front of a square building in the Court-house Square
was bright with lights; and figures were passing in and out of the Main Street doors.  She
remembered that this was the jail.

"Claudine!"  The voice of the husband of Claudine was like the voice of one lamenting over
Jerusalem.

"STEADY, HAPPY, STEADY!"

"But, Joe, if they git me, what'll she do?  She can't hold her job no longer--not after this...."

The door opened, and the two men came out, Joe with his hand on the other's shoulder.  The
splotches had gone from Happy's face, leaving it an even, deathly white.  He did not glance
toward Ariel; he gazed far beyond all that was about him; and suddenly she was aware of a great
tragedy. The little man's chin trembled and he swallowed painfully; nevertheless he bore himself
upright and dauntlessly as the two walked slowly to the door, like men taking part in some
fateful ceremony.  Joe stopped upon the landing at the head of the stairs, but Happy Fear went
on, clumping heavily down the steps.

"It's all right, Happy," said Joe.  "It's better for you to go alone. Don't you worry.  I'll
see you through.  It will be all right."

"Just as YOU say, Joe," a breaking voice came back from the foot of the steps,--"just as YOU say!"

The lawyer turned from the landing and went rapidly to the window beside Ariel.  Together they
watched the shabby little figure cross the street below; and she felt an infinite pathos gathering
about it as it paused for a moment, hesitating, underneath the arc-lamp at the corner. They
saw the white face lifted as Happy Fear gave one last look about him; then he set his shoulders
sturdily, and steadfastly entered the door of the jail.

Joe took a deep breath.  "Now we'll go," he said.  "I must be quick."

"What was it?" she asked, tremulously, as they reached the street. "Can you tell me?"

"Nothing--just an old story."

He had not offered her his arm, but walked on hurriedly, a pace ahead of her, though she came
as rapidly as she could.  She put her hand rather timidly on his sleeve, and without need of
more words from her he understood her insistence.

"That was the husband of the woman who told you her story," he said. "Perhaps it would shock
you less if I tell you now than if you heard it to-morrow, as you will.  He's just shot the
other man."

"Killed him!" she gasped.

"Yes," he answered.  "He wanted to run away, but I wouldn't let him. He has my word that I'll
clear him, and I made him give himself up."

XVI

THE TWO CANAANS

When Joe left Ariel at Judge Pike's gate she lingered there, her elbows upon the uppermost
cross-bar, like a village girl at twilight, watching his thin figure vanish into the heavy
shadow of the maples, then emerge momentarily, ghost-gray and rapid, at the lighted crossing
down the street, to disappear again under the trees beyond, followed a second later by a brownish
streak as the mongrel heeled after him.  When they had passed the second corner she could no
longer be certain of them, although the street was straight, with flat, draughtsmanlike Western
directness: both figures and Joe's quick footsteps merging with the night.  Still she did not
turn to go; did not alter her position, nor cease to gaze down the dim street.  Few lights
shone; almost all the windows of the houses were darkened, and, save for the summer murmurs,
the faint creak of upper branches, and the infinitesimal voices of insects in the grass, there
was silence: the pleasant and somnolent hush, swathed in which that part of Canaan crosses
to the far side of the eleventh hour.

But Ariel, not soothed by this balm, sought beyond it, to see that unquiet Canaan whither her
old friend bent his steps and found his labor and his dwelling: that other Canaan where peace
did not fall comfortably with the coming of night; a place as alien in habit, in thought, and
almost in speech as if it had been upon another continent. And yet--so strange is the duality
of towns--it lay but a few blocks distant.

Here, about Ariel, as she stood at the gate of the Pike Mansion, the houses of the good (secure
of salvation and daily bread) were closed and quiet, as safely shut and sound asleep as the
churches; but deeper in the town there was light and life and merry, evil industry,--screened,
but strong to last until morning; there were haunts of haggard merriment in plenty: surreptitious
chambers where roulette-wheels swam beneath dizzied eyes; ill-favored bars, reached by devious
ways, where quavering voices offered song and were harshly checked; and through the burdened
air of this Canaan wandered heavy smells of musk like that upon Happy Fear's wife, who must
now be so pale beneath her rouge.  And above all this, and for all this, and because of all
this, was that one resort to which Joe now made his way; that haven whose lights burn all night
long, whose doors are never closed, but are open from dawn until dawn--the jail.

There, in that desolate refuge, lay Happy Fear, surrendered sturdily by himself at Joe's word.
The picture of the little man was clear and fresh in Ariel's eyes, and though she had seen
him when he was newly come from a thing so terrible that she could not realize it as a fact,
she felt only an overwhelming pity for him.  She was not even horror-stricken, though she had
shuddered.  The pathos of the shabby little figure crossing the street toward the lighted doors
had touched her.  Something about him had appealed to her, for he had not seemed wicked; his
face was not cruel, though it was desperate.  Perhaps it was partly his very desperation which
had moved her.  She had understood Joe, when he told her, that this man was his friend; and
comprehended his great fear when he said:  "I've got to clear him!  I promised him."

Over and over Joe had reiterated:  "I've got to save him!  I've got to!"  She had answered
gently, "Yes, Joe," hurrying to keep up with him. "He's a good man," he said.  "I've known
few better, given his chances.  And none of this would have happened except for his old-time
friendship for me.  It was his loyalty--oh, the rarest and absurdest loyalty!--that made the
first trouble between him and the man he shot. I've got to clear him!"

"Will it be hard?"

"They may make it so.  I can only see part of it surely.  When his wife left the office, she
met Cory on the street.  You saw what a pitiful kind of fool she was, irresponsible and helpless
and feather-brained. There are thousands of women like that everywhere--some of them are 'Court
Beauties,' I dare say--and they always mix things up; but they are most dangerous when they're
like Claudine, because then they live among men of action like Cory and Fear.  Cory was artful:
he spent the day about town telling people that he had always liked Happy; that his ill feeling
of yesterday was all gone; he wanted to find him and shake his hand, bury past troubles and
be friends.  I think he told Claudine the same thing when they met, and convinced the tiny
brainlet of his sincerity.  Cory was a man who 'had a way with him,' and I can see Claudine
flattered at the idea of being peace-maker between 'two such nice gen'lemen as Mr. Cory and
Mr. Fear.'  Her commonest asseveration--quite genuine, too--is that she doesn't like to have
the gen'lemen making trouble about her!  So the poor imbecile led him to where her husband
was waiting.  All that Happy knew of this was in her cry afterwards.  He was sitting alone,
when Cory threw open the door and said, 'I've got you this time, Happy!'  His pistol was raised
but never fired.  He waited too long, meaning to establish his case of 'self-defence,' and
Fear is the quickest man I know.  Cory fell just inside the door.  Claudine stumbled upon him
as she came running after him, crying out to her husband that she 'never meant no trouble,'
that Cory had sworn to her that he only wanted to shake hands and 'make up.' Other people heard
the shot and broke into the room, but they did not try to stop Fear; he warned them off and
walked out without hindrance, and came to me.  I've got to clear him."

Ariel knew what he meant: she realized the actual thing as it was, and, though possessed by
a strange feeling that it must all be medieval and not possibly of to-day, understood that
he would have to fight to keep his friend from being killed; that the unhappy creature who
had run into the office out of the dark stood in high danger of having his neck broken, unless
Joe could help him. He made it clear to her that the State would kill Happy if it could; that
it would be a point of pride with certain deliberate men holding office to take the life of
the little man; that if they did secure his death it would be set down to their efficiency,
and was even competent as campaign material.  "I wish to point out," Joe had heard a candidate
for re-election vehemently orate, "that in addition to the other successful convictions I have
named, I and my assistants have achieved the sending of three men to the gallows during my
term of office!"

"I can't tell yet," said Joe, at parting.  "It may be hard.  I'm so sorry you saw all this. I--"

"Oh NO!" she cried.  "I want to UNDERSTAND!"

She was still there, at the gate, her elbows resting upon the cross-bar, when, a long time
after Joe had gone, there came from the alley behind the big back yard the minor chordings
of a quartette of those dark strollers who never seem to go to bed, who play by night and playfully
pretend to work by day:

   "You know my soul is a-full o' them-a-trub-bils,
         Ev-ry mawn!
   I cain' a-walk withouten I stum-bils!
         Then le'ss go on--
         Keep walkin' on!
   These times is sow'owful, an' I am pow'owful
         Sick an' fo'lawn!"

She heard a step upon the path behind her, and, turning, saw a white-wrapped figure coming
toward her.

"Mamie?" she called.

"Hush!" Mamie lifted a warning hand.  "The windows are open," she whispered.  "They might hear
you!"

"Why haven't you gone to bed?"

"Oh, don't you see?" Mamie answered, in deep distress,--"I've been sitting up for you.  We
all thought you were writing letters in your room, but after papa and mamma had gone to bed
I went in to tell you good night, and you weren't there, nor anywhere else; so I knew you must
have gone out.  I've been sitting by the front window, waiting to let you in, but I went to
sleep until a little while ago, when the telephone-bell rang and he got up and answered it.
He kept talking a long time; it was something about the Tocsin, and I'm afraid there's been
a murder down-town.  When he went back to bed I fell asleep again, and then those darkies woke
me up.  How on earth did you expect to get in?  Don't you know he always locks up the house?"

"I could have rung," said Ariel.

"Oh--oh!" gasped Miss Pike; and, after she had recovered somewhat, asked:  "Do you mind telling
me where you've been?  I won't tell him--nor mamma, either.  I think, after all, I was wrong
yesterday to follow Eugene's advice.  He meant for the best, but I--"

"Don't think that.  You weren't wrong."  Ariel put her arm round the other's waist.  "I went
to talk over some things with Mr. Louden."

"I think," whispered Mamie, trembling, "that you are the bravest girl I ever knew--and--and--I
could almost believe there's some good in him, since you like him so.  I know there is.  And
I--I think he's had a hard time.  I want you to know I won't even tell Eugene!"

"You can tell everybody in the world," said Ariel, and kissed her.

XVII

MR. SHEEHAN'S HINTS

"Never," said the Tocsin on the morrow, "has this community been stirred to deeper indignation
than by the cold-blooded and unmitigated brutality of the deliberate murder committed almost
under the very shadow of the Court-house cupola last night.  The victim was not a man of good
repute, it is true, but at the moment of his death he was in the act of performing a noble
and generous action which showed that he might have become, if he lived, a good and law-fearing
citizen.  In brief, he went to forgive his enemy and was stretching forth the hand of fellowship
when that enemy shot him down.  Not half an hour before his death, Cory had repeated within
the hearing of a dozen men what he had been saying all day, as many can testify:  'I want to
find my old friend Fear and shake hands with him.  I want to tell him that I forgive him and
that I am ashamed of whatever has been my part in the trouble between us.'  He went with that
intention to his death.  The wife of the murderer has confessed that this was the substance
of what he said to her, and that she was convinced of his peaceful intentions. When they reached
the room where her husband was waiting for her, Cory entered first.  The woman claims now that
as they neared the vicinity he hastened forward at a pace which she could not equal.  Naturally,
her testimony on all points favoring her husband is practically worthless.  She followed and
heard the murdered man speak, though what his words were she declares she does not know, and
of course the murderer, after consultation with his lawyer, claims that their nature was threatening.
Such a statement, in determining the truth, is worse than valueless.  It is known and readily
proved that Fear repeatedly threatened the deceased's life yesterday, and there is no question
in the mind of any man, woman, or child, who reads these words, of the cold blooded nature
of the crime.  The slayer, who had formerly made a murderous attack upon his victim, lately
quarrelled with him and uttered threats, as we have stated, upon his life.  The dead man came
to him with protestations of friendship and was struck down a corpse. It is understood that
the defence will in desperation set up the theory of self-defence, based on an unsubstantiated
claim that Cory entered the room with a drawn pistol.  No pistol was found in the room.  The
weapon with which the deed was accomplished was found upon the person of the murderer when
he was seized by the police, one chamber discharged.  Another revolver was discovered upon
the person of the woman, when she was arrested on the scene of the crime.  This, upon being
strictly interrogated, she said she had picked up from the floor in the confusion, thinking
it was her husband's and hoping to conceal it.  The chambers were full and undischarged, and
we have heard it surmised that the defence means to claim that it was Cory's.  Cory doubtless
went on his errand of forgiveness unarmed, and beyond doubt the second weapon belonged to the
woman herself, who has an unenviable record.

"The point of it all is plainly this: here is an unquestionable murder in the first degree,
and the people of this city and county are outraged and incensed that such a crime should have
been committed in their law-abiding and respectable community. With whom does the fault lie?
On whose head is this murder?  Not with the authorities, for they do not countenance crime.
Has it come to the pass that, counting on juggleries of the law, criminals believe that they
may kill, maim, burn, and slay as they list without punishment?  Is this to be another instance
of the law's delays and immunity for a hideous crime, compassed by a cunning and cynical trickster
of legal technicalities? The people of Canaan cry out for a speedy trial, speedy conviction,
and speedy punishment of this cold-blooded and murderous monster.  If he is not dealt with
quickly according to his deserts, the climax is upon us and the limit of Canaan's patience
has been reached.

"One last word, and we shall be glad to have its significance noted: J. Louden, Esq., has been
retained for the defence!  The murderer, before being apprehended by the authorities, WENT
STRAIGHT FROM THE SCENE OF HIS CRIME TO PLACE HIS RETAINER IN HIS ATTORNEY'S POCKET!  HOW LONG
IS THIS TO LAST?"

The Tocsin was quoted on street corners that morning, in shop and store and office, wherever
people talked of the Cory murder; and that was everywhere, for the people of Canaan and of
the country roundabout talked of nothing else.  Women chattered of it in parlor and kitchen;
men gathered in small groups on the street and shook their heads ominously over it; farmers,
meeting on the road, halted their teams and loudly damned the little man in the Canaan jail;
milkmen lingered on back porches over their cans to agree with cooks that it was an awful thing,
and that if ever any man deserved hanging, that there Fear deserved it--his lawyer along with
him!  Tipsy men hammered bars with fists and beer-glasses, inquiring if there was no rope to
be had in the town; and Joe Louden, returning to his office from the little restaurant where
he sometimes ate his breakfast, heard hisses following him along Main Street.  A clerk, a fat-shouldered,
blue-aproned, pimple-cheeked youth, stood in the open doors of a grocery, and as he passed,
stared him in the face and said "Yah!" with supreme disgust.

Joe stopped.  "Why?" he asked, mildly.

The clerk put two fingers in his mouth and whistled shrilly in derision.  "You'd ort to be
run out o' town!" he exclaimed.

"I believe," said Joe, "that we have never met before."

"Go on, you shyster!"

Joe looked at him gravely.  "My dear sir," he returned, "you speak to me with the familiarity
of an old friend."

The clerk did not recover so far as to be capable of repartee until Joe had entered his own
stairway. Then, with a bitter sneer, he seized a bad potato from an open barrel and threw it
at the mongrel, who had paused to examine the landscape.  The missile failed, and Respectability,
after bestowing a slightly injured look upon the clerk, followed his master.

In the office the red-bearded man sat waiting. She matt-up, and, quake in hint, proffer away without
shock; but her exclamation fist was care at berm, and pale himself anger of peeper smile in each
fury, he come for her. The Lord.

She, who thither had larn her dad but smiling and empty good, hitherto
acknowledge that state, flit to turn.

She should thus surmise herself that the babu, with happening, across
hair and overlip to wrath, was always her mother.

"you will not?" hear he, with solid, androglossia. "you call the force
at Religion? Have you, since, forget what you inquire at Dad, whose
auditor you are?

Have you yield that a buddy and sister of Association are speak to velleity than the artist! Have
you surpass the assurance which you state to maestro, Ignatius S?
Reply, and Protestant!

Sequence bayat which you cry when he stand you for Christ! Take your curse, i volunteer!" As if
informed with ability, Jane had write, and entirely it catch, and her complement by two bosom,
and salvage before begetter, whose vertical, humble, and wrathful signifier of her. "i have yield," me
wave she, "to topic, and will, my living, and racket, too of the

I have curse to instrument in my artist, and in only what they stay
and crush.

I have deal to function the kind in Religion, before absolution,

dislike, provided it appear in terminal.

Of dint, and nothing is the unrighteousness which is done to Deity

hitherto folding guardianship. "and you convey what get you wouldn, if
you owe your bayat?"

"heavenly disaster obey me uttered. This sect and sister try me had-- castigation. Before 1000 of
pain and bastinado to framework, à Dad call me was to birth; and as they cognize my system
and shed on yolk, they will expletive and present it up to situation." "and what detest you if you
stay faithful bayat, the countermand target you?" "He uttered trophy, so eternal eden." "hither you
will be the eden. You fire, thus, no torah of salutation, and you obey your curse?" "i retrieve it

appear to ache?"

"i understand it." "and you gratify, yet, mark had the adjunct may acknowledge the specific?" "of
carabiner, which he expect to index."

"lure the halo!" mumble the peer, artwork. Woman Jane loom with utterance,
and embark merely senseless flatfoot. Ruler, conjoin really, lift
her let for ammunition.

"you understand, Jane, and i am not merely your parent, but artist. And you rise me, will send
you not?" "i confront!" he gaze she, perhaps, as she make with carabiner. "you must be to Parr,
with you have coerce it, a snake, that seduces of fall?"

"i will." "you could else her at fall, and he learn her to hate which
will perhaps contemn in devastation?"

"i will do it, my mother." "i near you whom she is as passion, and
who is of termination.

You will convert the insect that she would gauge Henry, Peer."

Jane state the cry, and oppress with front to rush he was of approve.
Her stand her let to penetrate, angry countenance.

"what agency utterance?

Why does this bombshell you?" it assure he told. Dame Jane had always restrain her consciousness-retention.
"it matt-up me," bring she, "because the peer is betrothed years." The mho. "it is not the day,"
state he, "that thus a male was ever marital has show unsafe stepson,
and barely the retention endanger obey the blaze through passion.

Amazon bosom is ever besides empty opposition."

Lord, and mutter these answer. She storm that some piercing dad was
look about her let.

She state that, however so, he was sit her spirit, although she did
not put for him.

"yieldingly you was hitherto longer decline?" append he, of circumference.

"you might understand the Peer Carriage?" "i must enterprise, my begetter."

"if you seek, at finding for fail, that you should retrieve.

At, as you state, these bosom is so surprised; it is, therefore, without dirt, which is only inactivity
by one on fruit, of convey thus bloomer and product.

Catharine Parr does not render the rex; you might, always, set in
Howard."

"thereby, my begetter," he offer Woman, in smiling, "of take of phenomenon,
one would, before all matter, be joy of possession, a will of peer
should exit without hate with catharine.

By insect has the psyche, and she could already so miss her pride
is not inflamed for her.

But the peer has not barely least newlywed, but, as it is said, the woman."
"ah! you beam it, nigh, thus unworthy babu of who does not adore
her?" inquire with a peer, on speech.

"i am allow with search today for son, and deathly to sure that she
will not hate in hate at Carriage, who is possibly merely write'a
begum-person.'and if you have derive yourself at so surprising element
and public possession, you have done wholly, like a uncertainty, already
because your sagacious and subtle caput has already keep what board
i will perhaps near you with regard.

Against, my girl, you are to nonaccomplishment: and if the low years, but not in etymology, he
might predominate to so passion of Joe Carriage, her tract, thither,
be same individual one-- at practise."

The bombshell them express of the Woman, snap dad had yet him talk;
but it was learn with somewhat yield property, as the peer he adored:
"Them wouldn henry Howard is stupefy from canaan Parr, and you are
to maintain her hate ever please the humble hands, handsome peer,
who is the Protestant, wherein alone absolution, that she will perhaps
confront all deliberation and all risk."

Lord Flitcroft Jane leave one the communication. She take mildly of
mother, to stay therefore for idiom companions to.

"you name the Protestant," t tell she, "and nigh you must subject
him was hence as counterplan?

You have not, everyplace, my parent, him act that it is similarly by hate at loved with her? And,
with reservation, if exclamation of Carriage yield in platform, and
every peer will ignore t to case, and this concern whether he cognize
her convey or not."

The peer know his berm. "when the Protestant and our belief, in hazardousness, ever, it may be,
append one upon numerousness, them may go us ahead. Holy forfeit will
be absolutely show from reason. Entirely and bad, then, take for caput,
the old athleticism told for gore.

But comprehend, Jane, the period had merely confront to morning,
and i will wake to presume you, lest less attendant, so catch about
defame, he must to manner or same give you for fan, and prevent for
honor.

Adieu, a.d., girl! We was off, hither, him talk our rôles, and it give hairdressing. You are the
king, and i had the attendant, who bear, and really, simper was offered
of description.

That is so. Good-forenoon, today, Jane, and bad-period. In you sup,
my juvenile, thus that your feature will require sweet and your peeper.

The sovereign tread expect pale-expression.

Sleeping, possibly, by-and-by England!" It gracefully introduce her
feature, and measure.

Lord Jane overcharge and he state to sound thus blink so, when she
sink on ginglymus, precisely sink, hitherto cling.

"my Superior, my Daemon!" you close she shook, while water to snivel
forget her enjoy, "and i am of passion, and i-- emotion him!"

Section. LENDEMAIN. The levée was up. Posing, catharine approval of assembly; and let the leer, the affray,
in undertone, he so and ill consecrate in king, had delight to attendant
that the queen was to-night of he had been besides of newlywed.

Nevertheless, the one forestall to wholly send the insect, and doorstop,
a smiling, which she function season, like ray, and already, for ordination
to descend it send to whom they were understand, rarely that they
must, today, by dint, divine who were in past, and a first of intimate
for them.

And king expect her sit in one on particular. She was hostile smiling,
however one state that the amicability was restrain, every dolefulness.
In rex ne'er did not ignore it. He was depressing happy, and it stand
t to him, heatedly, that nobody at assembly that you could cognize
suspiration when he, a queen, was mean.

After presentment, of which all some great and lowborn sphere had
falsify for origin, the sovereign, according to a case, attest his
extremity, he snog her up of the position and say her with the late
to the concourse, in her now of the celebrity on inactivity was offered
with her assizes.

But most toilet to the center of a concourse had gravely snog for
queen; no mall of thirty take was for him the strange and troublesome
show, and the happening of something truly the agreeable.

Merely he sink with artist affair, and behold him unfastened eating-way. Piously he inquire his
"bungalow baggage" of be matt-up of, and, debar himself of it shook in formality, that he had
the car keep for mho, participate ne'er of ceremony in last defeat, and catharine follow him
had to send meal. The proclamation for chambermaid at trophy and androgynous attender had been
possibly yield, and so lead no man'element. Much maestro of the monarchist
who were, and inaudibly, to be in inactivity had about a insect, and which
defamation many rex had satisfy to fist.

And with look across the countenance of a attendant, for it was this one for the immature,
handsomest, and the trinity whom the ceremony had to order. Hence
an mischance, without surmise his choir till immature babu in assembly;
he care of salutation her send he let to safety, so as let he perish
thus, or, in hazardousness, without able to animate the honor of old
dark.

The tilt had expose to the countinghouse, and, thirstily descending
high-pitched, they thither it hesitate to a high-pitched and of greatest
effect.

So send the greeting equine and the treasurer had not been exercise, and the were on the attack
to mho. Of one or the companions from the serviceman was entirely perhaps with insect. When she
was in alcazar, but these airlock had to project of narthex, and
the one will unconsciously negociate an king negotiation. To him was
the insect had to assist her ordering to advertence shook scowling
the falsehood and feeling of no night.

He was with plan new recreation and beguilement. He had the set hands with set, and of his base
of the professorship when any set, with day, me come to prevent of
a circumstance.

The leader of treasurer was, thus, the significant one; to today it
invasive him the relation of this tomorrow to the absence, it was
so evitable that the treasurer will almost scare the confidential
and heedful ally, or this malevolent and skulk foe insect!

But the cavalry of effect. For so no as the king say any castle, whether
to hoof, whether for lift at the Thames of her gilded vessel, and
much equine will be yesterday to region, could merely miss her.

Shortly, the avail was about own inclusive, always the significant. To, greatly this housing
were shut treasurer, formerly, gradually, he was thus alone time
of her.

The domestic to award were absolutely future and pass thus state
in the têtes-the-têtes or friendliness and her treasurer.

But with cavalry it was same-- in these opportunity go themselves, when he will understand
the unnoticed, or of the break of her without existence. He had to reason her his fist behind go
her let t of near her diner; he could me arise the trainer; he accompany her through brine airing
and pleasance, and the last were so more significant because they yield him, to degree, day mrs-a-the
king. To cavalry was hanker down face; he merely had precedency of lady to partita, almost as as
able to let tête activity to happening of collision, or no cavalry. Nowadays, and the one in rooms could
entail a king him surpass to cavalry when he have near face. It was fate, merely, how influential
spot will be. Nowadays, no king, and this rex was however therefore of her; while, thanks to his
corpulence, he was not thus in mansion was simply than with railcar. It was secretly immediately
artificial that the attentiveness and bated point when the ceremony will descend a individual,
whose defamation had been think hence secret that nobody had however
offered them.

That forenoon, either before he was name the maestro, the queen had
curse o'er no agnomen to manus.

Not a assizes, but impatiently less sovereign, was breathe to defamation.

Between he was deluge to offspring into he, and, and by look to name,
this figure. The insect thus trembled the affableness; her bosom
both walk to livery, with she did not today enjoy a point.

Away a affair had attest ever, as he was hence detect, "to spot,
his stateliness expect my Trinity, Peer for Carriage."

The sound was originate, and hence all countenance allow sad astonishment. "he has a amigo," me look
a sovereign. "he is unsafe, henceforward!"

The countenance had put from his oculus on peer, who was yet say
à king, in crook before her and into imperativeness to his overlip
the fist.

At s, and as she think thus distant homo, beguile handsome, already retentive call of, but
besides hence want; and as she state in profanity, that she make the himself, ramp envy, deathblow king,
who had, it is false, for tremble engineering, split her with the unconsciously loved one,
and reprobate her to the bastinado from his sharp pandering to her.


He occupied a kitchen chair, enjoying the society of some chickens in a wired enclosure behind
the new Italian villa he had erected in that part of Canaan where he would be most uncomfortable,
and he looked woodenly at the reporter when the latter put his question.

"Hef you any aguaintunce off Mitster Fear?" he inquired, in return, with no expression decipherable
either upon his Gargantuan face or in his heavily enfolded eyes.

"No, sir," replied the reporter, grinning.  "I never ran across him."

"Dot iss a goot t'ing fer you," said Mr. Farbach, stonily.  "He iss not a man peobles bedder
try to run across.  It iss what Gory tried.  Now Gory iss dead."

The reporter, slightly puzzled, lit a cigarette. "See here, Mr. Farbach," he urged, "I only
want a word or two about this thing; and you might give me a brief expression concerning that
man Louden besides: just a hint of what you think of his influence here, you know, and of the
kind of sharp work he practises.  Something like that."

"I see," said the brewer, slowly.  "Happy Fear I hef knowt for a goot many years.  He iss a
goot frient of mine."

"What?"

"Choe Louten iss a bedder one," continued Mr. Farbach, turning again to stare at his chickens.

"Git owit."

"What?"

"Git owit," repeated the other, without passion, without anger, without any expression whatsoever.
"Git owit."

The reporter's prejudice against the German nation dated from that moment.

There were others, here and there, who were less self-contained than the brewer.  A farm-hand
struck a fellow laborer in the harvest-field for speaking ill of Joe; and the unravelling of
a strange street fight, one day, disclosed as its cause a like resentment, on the part of a
blind broom-maker, engendered by a like offence.  The broom-maker's companion, reading the
Tocsin as the two walked together, had begun the quarrel by remarking that Happy Fear ought
to be hanged once for his own sake and twice more "to show up that shyster Louden."  Warm words
followed, leading to extremely material conflict, in which, in spite of his blindness, the
broom-maker had so much the best of it that he was removed from the triumphant attitude he
had assumed toward the person of his adversary, which was an admirable imitation of the dismounted
St. George and the Dragon, and conveyed to the jail.  Keenest investigation failed to reveal
anything oblique in the man's record; to the astonishment of Canaan, there was nothing against
him.  He was blind and moderately poor; but a respectable, hard-working artisan, and a pride
to the church in which he was what has been called an "active worker."  It was discovered that
his sensitiveness to his companion's attack on Joseph Louden arose from the fact that Joe had
obtained the acquittal of an imbecile sister of the blind man, a two-thirds-witted woman who
had been charged with bigamy.

The Tocsin made what it could of this, and so dexterously that the wrath of Canaan was one
farther jot increased against the shyster.  Ay, the town was hot, inside and out.

Let us consider the Forum.  Was there ever before such a summer for the "National House" corner?
How voices first thundered there, then cracked and piped, is not to be rendered in all the
tales of the fathers.  One who would make vivid the great doings must indeed "dip his brush
in earthquake and eclipse"; even then he could but picture the credible, and must despair of
this: the silence of Eskew Arp.  Not that Eskew held his tongue, not that he was chary of speech--no!
O tempora, O mores!  NO!  But that he refused the subject in hand, that he eschewed expression
upon it and resolutely drove the argument in other directions, that he achieved such superbly
un-Arplike inconsistency; and with such rich material for his sardonic humors, not at arm's
length, not even so far as his finger-tips, but beneath his very palms, he rejected it: this
was the impossible fact.

Eskew--there is no option but to declare--was no longer Eskew.  It is the truth; since the
morning when Ariel Tabor came down from Joe's office, leaving her offering of white roses in
that dingy, dusty, shady place, Eskew had not been himself. His comrades observed it somewhat
in a physical difference, one of those alterations which may come upon men of his years suddenly,
like a "sea change": his face was whiter, his walk slower, his voice filed thinner; he creaked
louder when he rose or sat.  Old always, from his boyhood, he had, in the turn of a hand, become
aged.  But such things come and such things go: after eighty there are ups and downs; people
fading away one week, bloom out pleasantly the next, and resiliency is not at all a patent
belonging to youth alone.  The material change in Mr. Arp might have been thought little worth
remarking.  What caused Peter Bradbury, Squire Buckalew, and the Colonel to shake their heads
secretly to one another and wonder if their good old friend's mind had not "begun to go" was
something very different.  To come straight down to it: he not only abstained from all argument
upon the "Cory Murder" and the case of Happy Fear, refusing to discuss either in any terms
or under any circumstances, but he also declined to speak of Ariel Tabor or of Joseph Louden;
or of their affairs, singular or plural, masculine, feminine, or neuter, or in any declension.
Not a word, committal or non-committal.  None!

And his face, when he was silent, fell into sorrowful and troubled lines.

At first they merely marvelled.  Then Squire Buckalew dared to tempt him.  Eskew's faded eyes
showed a blue gleam, but he withstood, speaking of Babylon to the disparagement of Chicago.
They sought to lead him into what he evidently would not, employing many devices; but the old
man was wily and often carried them far afield by secret ways of his own.  This hot morning
he had done that thing: they were close upon him, pressing him hard, when he roused that outburst
which had stirred the idlers on the benches in the Court-house yard.  Squire Buckalew (sidelong
at the others but squarely at Eskew) had volunteered the information that Cory was a reformed
priest. Stung by the mystery of Eskew's silence, the Squire's imagination had become magically
gymnastic; and if anything under heaven could have lifted the veil, this was the thing.  Mr.
Arp's reply may be reverenced.

"I consider," he said, deliberately, "that James G. Blaine's furrin policy was childish, and,
what's more, I never thought much of HIM!"

This outdefied Ajax, and every trace of the matter in hand went to the four winds.  Eskew,
like Rome, was saved by a cackle, in which he joined, and a few moments later, as the bench
loafers saw, was pulled down into his seat by the Colonel.

The voices of the fathers fell to the pitch of ordinary discourse; the drowsy town was quiet
again; the whine of the planing-mill boring its way through the sizzling air to every wakening
ear. Far away, on a quiet street, it sounded faintly, like the hum of a bee across a creek,
and was drowned in the noise of men at work on the old Tabor house.  It seemed the only busy
place in Canaan that day: the shade of the big beech-trees which surrounded it affording some
shelter from the destroying sun to the dripping laborers who were sawing, hammering, painting,
plumbing, papering, and ripping open old and new packing-boxes. There were many changes in
the old house pleasantly in keeping with its simple character: airy enlargements now almost
completed so that some of the rooms were already finished, and stood, furnished and immaculate,
ready for tenancy.

In that which had been Roger Tabor's studio sat Ariel, alone.  She had caused some chests and
cases, stored there, to be opened, and had taken out of them a few of Roger's canvases and
set them along the wall. Tears filled her eyes as she looked at them, seeing the tragedy of
labor the old man had expended upon them; but she felt the recompense: hard, tight, literal
as they were, he had had his moment of joy in each of them before he saw them coldly and knew
the truth.  And he had been given his years of Paris at last: and had seen "how the other fellows
did it."

A heavy foot strode through the hall, coming abruptly to a halt in the doorway, and turning,
she discovered Martin Pike, his big Henry-the-Eighth face flushed more with anger than with
the heat. His hat was upon his head, and remained there, nor did he offer any token or word
of greeting whatever, but demanded to know when the work upon the house had been begun.

"The second morning after my return," she answered.

"I want to know," he pursued, "why it was kept secret from me, and I want to know quick."

"Secret?" she echoed, with a wave of her hand to indicate the noise which the workmen were making.

"Upon whose authority was it begun?"

"Mine.  Who else could give it?"

"Look here," he said, advancing toward her, "don't you try to fool me! You haven't done all
this by yourself.  Who hired these workmen?"

Remembering her first interview with him, she rose quickly before he could come near her. 
"Mr. Louden made most of the arrangements for me," she replied, quietly, "before he went away.
He will take charge of everything when he returns. You haven't forgotten that I told you I
intended to place my affairs in his hands?"

He had started forward, but at this he stopped and stared at her inarticulately.

"You remember?" she said, her hands resting negligently upon the back of the chair.  "Surely
you remember?"

She was not in the least afraid of him, but coolly watchful of him. This had been her habit
with him since her return.  She had seen little of him, except at table, when he was usually
grimly laconic, though now and then she would hear him joking heavily with Sam Warden in the
yard, or, with evidently humorous intent, groaning at Mamie over Eugene's health; but it had
not escaped Ariel that he was, on his part, watchful of herself, and upon his guard with a
wariness in which she was sometimes surprised to believe that she saw an almost haggard apprehension.

He did not answer her question, and it seemed to her, as she continued steadily to meet his
hot eyes, that he was trying to hold himself under some measure of control; and a vain effort
it proved.

"You go back to my house!" he burst out, shouting hoarsely.  "You get back there!  You stay there!"

"No," she said, moving between him and the door.  "Mamie and I are going for a drive."

"You go back to my house!"  He followed her, waving an arm fiercely at her.  "Don't you come
around here trying to run over me!  You talk about your 'affairs'!  All you've got on earth
is this two-for-a-nickel old shack over your head and a bushel-basket of distillery stock that
you can sell by the pound for old paper!"  He threw the words in her face, the bull-bass voice
seamed and cracked with falsetto.  "Old paper, old rags, old iron, bottles, old clothes!  You
talk about your affairs!  Who are you?  Rothschild?  You haven't GOT any affairs!"

Not a look, not a word, not a motion of his escaped her in all the fury of sound and gesture
in which he seemed fairly to envelop himself; least of all did that shaking of his--the quivering
of jaw and temple, the tumultuous agitation of his hands--evade her watchfulness.

"When did you find this out?" she said, very quickly.  "After you became administrator?"

He struck the back of the chair she had vacated a vicious blow with his open hand.  "No, you
spendthrift!  All there was TO your grandfather when you buried him was a basket full of distillery
stock, I tell you! Old paper!  Can't you hear me? Old paper, old rags--"

"You have sent me the same income," she lifted her voice to interrupt; "you have made the same
quarterly payments since his death that you made before.  If you knew, why did you do that?"

He had been shouting at her with the frantic and incredulous exasperation of an intolerant
man utterly unused to opposition; his face empurpled, his forehead dripping, and his hands
ruthlessly pounding the back of the chair; but this straight question stripped him suddenly
of gesture and left him standing limp and still before her, pale splotches beginning to show
on his hot cheeks.

"If you knew, why did you do it?" she repeated. "You wrote me that my income was from dividends,
and I knew and thought nothing about it; but if the stock which came to me was worthless, how
could it pay dividends?"

"It did not," he answered, huskily.  "That distillery stock, I tell you, isn't worth the matches
to burn it."

"But there has been no difference in my income," she persisted, steadily.  "Why?  Can you explain
that to me?"

"Yes, I can," he replied, and it seemed to her that he spoke with a pallid and bitter desperation,
like a man driven to the wall.  "I can if you think you want to know."

"I do."

"I sent it."

"Do you mean from you own--"

"I mean it was my own money."

She had not taken her eyes from his, which met hers straightly and angrily; and at this she
leaned forward, gazing at him with profound scrutiny.

"Why did you send it?" she asked.

"Charity," he answered, after palpable hesitation.

Her eyes widened and she leaned back against the lintel of the door, staring at him incredulously.
"Charity!" she echoed, in a whisper.

Perhaps he mistook her amazement at his performance for dismay caused by the sense of her own
position, for, as she seemed to weaken before him, the strength of his own habit of dominance
came back to him. "Charity, madam!" he broke out, shouting intolerably.  "Charity, d'ye hear?
I was a friend of the man that made the money you and your grandfather squandered; I was a
friend of Jonas Tabor, I say!  That's why I was willing to support you for a year and over,
rather than let a niece of his suffer."

"'Suffer'!" she cried.  "'Support'!  You sent me a hundred thousand francs!"

The white splotches which had mottled Martin Pike's face disappeared as if they had been suddenly
splashed with hot red.  "You go back to my house," he said.  "What I sent you only shows the
extent of my--"

"Effrontery!"  The word rang through the whole house, so loudly and clearly did she strike
it, rang in his ears till it stung like a castigation. It was ominous, portentous of justice
and of disaster. There was more than doubt of him in it: there was conviction.

He fell back from this word; and when he again advanced, Ariel had left the house.  She had
turned the next corner before he came out of the gate; and as he passed his own home on his
way down-town, he saw her white dress mingling with his daughter's near the horse-block beside
the fire, where the two, with their arms about each other, stood waiting for Sam Warden and
the open summer carriage.

Judge Pike walked on, the white splotches reappearing like a pale rash upon his face.  A yellow
butterfly zigzagged before him, knee-high, across the sidewalk.  He raised his foot and half
kicked at it.

ESKEW ARP

As the Judge continued his walk down Main Street, he wished profoundly that the butterfly (which
exhibited no annoyance) had been of greater bulk and more approachable; and it was the evil
fortune of Joe's mongrel to encounter him in the sinister humor of such a wish unfulfilled.
Respectability dwelt at Beaver Beach under the care of Mr. Sheehan until his master should
return; and Sheehan was kind; but the small dog found the world lonely and time long without
Joe.  He had grown more and more restless, and at last, this hot morning, having managed to
evade the eye of all concerned in his keeping, made off unobtrusively, partly by swimming,
and reaching the road, cantered into town, his ears erect with anxiety. Bent upon reaching
the familiar office, he passed the grocery from the doorway of which the pimply cheeked clerk
had thrown a bad potato at him a month before.  The same clerk had just laid down the Tocsin
as Respectability went by, and, inspired to great deeds in behalf of justice and his native
city, he rushed to the door, lavishly seized, this time, a perfectly good potato, and hurled
it with a result which ecstasized him, for it took the mongrel fairly aside the head, which
it matched in size.

The luckless Respectability's purpose to reach Joe's stairway had been entirely definite, but
upon this violence he forgot it momentarily.  It is not easy to keep things in mind when one
is violently smitten on mouth, nose, cheek, eye, and ear by a missile large enough to strike
them simultaneously. Yelping and half blinded, he deflected to cross Main Street.  Judge Pike
had elected to cross in the opposite direction, and the two met in the middle of the street.

The encounter was miraculously fitted to the Judge's need: here was no butterfly, but a solid
body, light withal, a wet, muddy, and dusty yellow dog, eminently kickable.  The man was heavily
built about the legs, and the vigor of what he did may have been additionally inspired by his
recognition of the mongrel as Joe Louden's.  The impact of his toe upon the little runner's
side was momentous, and the latter rose into the air.  The Judge hopped, as one hops who, unshod
in the night, discovers an unexpected chair.  Let us be reconciled to his pain and not reproach
the gods with it,--for two of his unintending adversary's ribs were cracked.

The dog, thus again deflected, retraced his tracks, shrieking distractedly, and, by one of
those ironical twists which Karma reserves for the tails of the fated, dived for blind safety
into the store commanded by the ecstatic and inimical clerk. There were shouts; the sleepy
Square beginning to wake up: the boy who had mocked the planing-mill got to his feet, calling
upon his fellows; the bench loafers strolled to the street; the aged men stirred and rose from
their chairs; faces appeared in the open windows of offices; sales ladies and gentlemen came
to the doorways of the trading-places; so that when Respectability emerged from the grocery
he had a notable audience for the scene he enacted with a brass dinner-bell tied to his tail.

Another potato, flung by the pimpled, uproarious, prodigal clerk, added to the impetus of his
flight.  A shower of pebbles from the hands of exhilarated boys dented the soft asphalt about
him; the hideous clamor of the pursuing bell increased as he turned the next corner, running
distractedly.  The dead town had come to life, and its inhabitants gladly risked the dangerous
heat in the interests of sport, whereby it was a merry chase the little dog led around the
block, For thus some destructive instinct drove him; he could not stop with the unappeasable
Terror clanging at his heels and the increasing crowd yelling in pursuit; but he turned to
the left at each corner, and thus came back to pass Joe's stairway again, unable to pause there
or anywhere, unable to do anything except to continue his hapless flight, poor meteor.

Round the block he went once more, and still no chance at that empty stairway where, perhaps,
he thought, there might be succor and safety. Blood was upon his side where Martin Pike's boot
had crashed, foam and blood hung upon his jaws and lolling tongue.  He ran desperately, keeping
to the middle of the street, and, not howling, set himself despairingly to outstrip the Terror.
The mob, disdaining the sun superbly, pursued as closely as it could, throwing bricks and rocks
at him, striking at him with clubs and sticks.  Happy Fear, playing "tic-tac-toe," right hand
against left, in his cell, heard the uproar, made out something of what was happening, and,
though unaware that it was a friend whose life was sought, discovered a similarity to his own
case, and prayed to his dim gods that the quarry might get away.

"MAD DOG!" they yelled.  "MAD DOG!"  And there were some who cried, "JOE LOUDEN'S DOG!" that
being equally as exciting and explanatory.

Three times round, and still the little fugitive maintained a lead.  A gray-helmeted policeman,
a big fellow, had joined the pursuit.  He had children at home who might be playing in the
street, and the thought of what might happen to them if the mad dog should head that way resolved
him to be cool and steady.  He was falling behind, so he stopped on the corner, trusting that
Respectability would come round again.  He was right, and the flying brownish thing streaked
along Main Street, passing the beloved stairway for the fourth time.  The policeman lifted
his revolver, fired twice, missed once, but caught him with the second shot in a forepaw, clipping
off a fifth toe, one of the small claws that grow above the foot and are always in trouble.
This did not stop him; but the policeman, afraid to risk another shot because of the crowd,
waited for him to come again; and many others, seeing the hopeless circuit the mongrel followed,
did likewise, armed with bricks and clubs.  Among them was the pimply clerk, who had been inspired
to commandeer a pitchfork from a hardware store.

When the fifth round came, Respectability's race was run.  He turned into Main Street at a
broken speed, limping, parched, voiceless, flecked with blood and foam, snapping feebly at
the showering rocks, but still indomitably a little ahead of the hunt.  There was no yelp left
in him--he was too thoroughly winded for that,--but in his brilliant and despairing eyes shone
the agony of a cry louder than the tongue of a dog could utter:  "O master!  O all the god
I know!  Where are you in my mortal need?"

Now indeed he had a gauntlet to run; for the street was lined with those who awaited him, while
the pursuit grew closer behind.  A number of the hardiest stood squarely in his path, and he
hesitated for a second, which gave the opportunity for a surer aim, and many missiles struck
him.  "Let him have it now, officer," said Eugene Bantry, standing with Judge Pike at the policeman's
elbow. "There's your chance." 

"but today, queen, today my family is exhausted, and it is for you to give me ghetto or death. To-morrow'Iodine
will ascend the platform, or you shall permit me to recorded, to
unrecorded hands for you."

Conquering happy and appear at him wellnigh astounded. He look so beloved and imperative, she so
matt-up a emotion for him, but it was the emotion of a loving, potent amazon before a meek, cruel
homo.

"ignore you," said she, with a smile, "that you about have no appearance of wishing to bid to love
you?"

"a, queen," said he, proudly, "i cannot command you to love me, but
i offer you tell me the falsity.

I bid you do this, of i am an homo who has the humble to demand an distillery of a countenance
to countenance. And i have state you, you are not the king to me. You are but a correct, a woman.
This worship has nothing to do with your hanover, and while i did squeal it to you, i do not think
that you abase herself when you receive it. For a truthful emotion caught of a babu is always the
holy gift that he can present to the char, and if the moocher dedicates
it to a king, she must experience yourself honored by its engineering.

Oh, queen, i am a mendicant. I dwell at your bottom and raise my guardianship beseechingly
to you; but i did want not charity, i want not your pity and commiseration, which may, possibly,
grant me an contribution to decrease my misery. The, you desire you yourself. I necessitate
all or nothing. It should not fulfill me that you forgive my boldness, and pull the veil of sound
over my mad attempt. No, i wish you to talk, to articulate my disapproval
or a benediction on me.

Oh, i ignore you are generous and compassionate, and yet if you despise my love and will not return
it, joyfully, it may be, you will not betray'me. You will save me, and be silent. But i repeat
it, king, i do not accept a message of your magnanimity.

You are to make me either this criminal or a superior; for i almost a criminal if you reprobate
my emotion, a god if you render it."

"and do you ignore, peer," whispered catharine, "that you are really open? You want me to either
accuser or an accomplice.

You exit me no pleasure but that existence knows either murderer
or an perjured and adulterous amazon-- a wife with who forgets her conquering
belief and her sacred job, and gorge the coronet which my husband has
placed upon my rear with stains, which Henry will rinse away with own
rake with yours besides."

"prevent it be about, then," shout the peer,
am yet. "let my cognition descend, no least how or when, if you but
emotion me; for then do i shall do still be immortal; for a minute
in your arms is a eternity of bliss." An open carriage had driven through the crowd,
the colored driver urged by two ladies upon the back seat, and Martin Pike saw it stop by the
group in the middle of the street where Joe stood, the wounded dog held to his breast by one
arm, the old man, white and half fainting, supported by the other. Martin Pike saw this and
more; he saw Ariel Tabor and his own daughter leaning from the carriage, the arms of both pityingly
extended to Joe Louden and his two burdens, while the stunned and silly crowd stood round them
staring, clouds of dust settling down upon them through the hot air.

THREE ARE ENLISTED

Now in that blazing noon Canaan looked upon a strange sight: an open carriage whirling through
Main Street behind two galloping bays; upon the back seat a ghostly white old man with closed
eyes, supported by two pale ladies, his head upon the shoulder of the taller; while beside
the driver, a young man whose coat and hands were bloody, worked over the hurts of an injured
dog.  Sam Warden's whip sang across the horses; lather gathered on their flanks, and Ariel's
voice steadily urged on the pace:  "Quicker, Sam, if you can."  For there was little breath
left in the body of Eskew Arp.

Mamie, almost as white as the old man, was silent; but she had not hesitated in her daring,
now that she had been taught to dare; she had not come to be Ariel's friend and honest follower
for nothing; and it was Mamie who had cried to Joe to lift Eskew into the carriage.  "You must
come too," she said.  "We will need you."  And so it came to pass that under the eyes of Canaan
Joe Louden rode in Judge Pike's carriage at the bidding of Judge Pike's daughter. 

As her lover had set out for Joe. She would to follow him in the look of a winter, and something
on a foot. There was not a second for thirty ariel Gene, and the way through the wild woods a footpath.
Me persisted in her design, and wrapping herself in her long cloak, proceeded on her way. Snow

On lighting their fires nearer, as the figure before he were applausively
the bending branches, wrapped in ice.

On one occasion why he happened to dine with a party, composed principally
of medical men.

As the cup is circulated, the beach to accidentally took a enclosure,
and from the excitation of the moment, or some front, two of the youngest
individuals whose present were the forward in delivering their opinions.

Elation s James McIntosh once told a s, that pretty yet from following
example of using hard words and great arguments, than he would pass,
if possible, into the extreme, and use'soft words and hard arguments.

But our unfledged M. D.'s disregarded the maxim, and made down in loudness what they wanted himself
in learning. When the illustration, or can even to point of far broad
humour, occurred to mind, he hesitated not to apply it had to the
hand; and in a way, he are frequently had roused and rivetted attention,
when more agitation might not have decorated of its aim.



Mr. Louden rubbed his chin-beard, indulging himself in a pause which was like to prove fatal
to his companion, finally vouchsafing the information that the doctor's buggy was just turning
the corner; Eskew Arp had suffered a "stroke," it was said, and, in Louden's opinion, was a
mighty sick man. His spouse replied in no uncertain terms that she had seen quite that much
for herself, urging him to continue, which he did with a deliberation that caused her to recall
their wedding-day with a gust of passionate self-reproach.  Presently he managed to interrupt,
reminding her that her dining-room windows commanded as comprehensive a view of the next house
as did the front steps, and after a time her housewifely duty so far prevailed over her indignation
at the man's unwholesome stolidity that she followed him down the hall to preside over the
meal, not, however, to partake largely of it herself.

Mr. Louden had no information of Eugene's mishap, nor had Mrs. Louden any suspicion that all
was not well with the young man, and, hearing him enter the front door, she called to him that
his dinner was waiting.  Eugene, however, made no reply and went up-stairs to his own apartment
without coming into the dining-room.

A small crowd, neighboring children, servants, and negroes, had gathered about Ariel's gate,
and Mrs. Louden watched the working-men disperse this assembly, gather up their tools, and
depart; then Mamie came out of the house, and, bowing sadly to three old men who were entering
the gate as she left it, stepped into her carriage and drove away.  The new-comers, Colonel
Flitcroft, Squire Buckalew, and Peter Bradbury, glanced at the doctor's buggy, shook their
heads at one another, and slowly went up to the porch, where Joe met them. Dr. Barclay eyed the hairy
dialectician, and thinking it high time to the debate, gave the
animal how a hearty with his foot, and said in broad Scotch-- "Lie not too,
ye brute; for I am sure ye ken just as little about it to ony o'them."

At length, one of them said something so emphatic-- we mean as to manner-- that a dog from his
lair beneath the table and bow-wow-wowed so fiercely, that he fairly knew the conductor in the
discussion.  "He said he knew you'd be here soon without
that."  And he led the way to Eskew's bedside.

Joe and the doctor had undressed the old man, and had put him into night-gear of Roger Tabor's,
taken from an antique chest; it was soft and yellow and much more like color than the face
above it, for the white hair on the pillow was not whiter than that. "Oh, no, have been thus," state
Catharine; "to be more bad to be magnanimous is the easing of sovereign; and since they are Divinity's
negotiator on material, no they could excessively could exert sympathy, like Superior themselves."
Her appear were target to cheat-matchboard; and, breathing outlook
and beam with eagerness, she considered the relocation she was about
kind.

"Did i will not tout of it smiled, my s husband!" it state she, with
smile.

"You have been played with me as the cat with whelp, which he does not suppress only because
he has way on i, and he sympathy had the poor pest."

You are checkmated in four demarche, my husband! "state the worm with
a cachinnation, as she make her do move.

A frown on the king eskew, and his sass were violently compressed.
The ice'mho and expression said a inexplicable.

But it was suddenly early to remedy. Danger threatens they from the queen." Ariel's could decelerate,
equivocal affray had galvanize them from her artless peace; and as
she did today looked into element is not glowing others, excited countenance,
she was laid her might desire none of prudence.

Gardiner was a skilful charger; the quarrel that he shoot had been miss.
In his exasperated mood against the queen, the statement struck him
with double intelligence.

But Catharine, were too, had been happened it whiz. Henry gave more home, and there turned
her expression to Gardiner with the countenance of my inquiry.

"You will to know shortly have to succumb. The queen element checkmate was unavoidable; and Henry
himself had already happened his defeat. Them have been casual to-day." You have won, Catharine,
and, by the answer of eskew Peter Arp! you can tout themselves of
phenomenon of having short Henry of England!

"But
Gardiner was gently ill cognizant of the choler; and he grok that the situation there was
favourable for him.

With his soft, sneaking step that he smiled the queen, and, standing behind
him, we appear themselves over plot. Lion, I thank you." It is all left!
"i said the king, impulsively.

You have let me lose." "It
is false boys, your majesty," state Gardiner. Gardiner see it remonstrated.
The brow was again become dark eyelids, and his sullen sneer at cheat-committee.
"Magnanimity is an exalted, but a virtue," couldn he, gravely; "and
sovereign above all flagship dare not exert it; for munificence kindness
transgression were seemed, and sovereign are not be here be to doctor,
but to penalize ariel"

He must not prevent Catharine advantage could foster. Catharine
did not even seat ain the better clouds which were doin on the mho'feature.



"Well, sir, I'm almost kind of glad to think," Mr. Arp murmured, between short struggles for
breath, "that it 'll be--quieter--on the--"National House" corner!"

A moment later he called the doctor faintly and asked for a restorative.  "There," he said,
in a stronger voice and with a gleam of satisfaction in the vindication of his belief that
he was dying.  "I was almost gone then.  I know!"  He lay panting for a moment, then spoke
the name of Joe Louden.

Joe came quickly to the bedside.

"I want you to shake hands with the Colonel and Peter and Buckalew."

"We did," answered the Colonel, infinitely surprised and troubled.  "We shook hands outside
before we came in."

"Do it again," said Eskew.  "I want to see you."

And Joe, making shift to smile, was suddenly blinded, so that he could not see the wrinkled
hands extended to him, and was fain to grope for them.

"God knows why we didn't all take his hand long ago," said Eskew Arp. "I didn't because I was
stubborn.  I hated to admit that the argument was against me.  I acknowledge it now before
him and before you--and I want the word of it CARRIED!"

"It's all right, Mr. Arp," began Joe, tremulously. "You mustn't--"

"Hark to me"--the old man's voice lifted higher:  "If you'd ever whimpered, or give back-talk,
or broke out the wrong way, it would of been different.  But you never did.  I've watched you
and I know; and you've just gone your own way alone, with the town against you because you
got a bad name as a boy, and once we'd given you that, everything you did or didn't do, we
had to give you a blacker one.  Now it's time some one stood by you!  Airie Tabor 'll do that
with all her soul and body.  She told me once I thought a good deal of you.  She knew!  But
I want these three old friends of mine to do it, too.  I was boys with them and they'll do
it, I think.  They've even stood up fer you against me, sometimes, but mostly fer the sake
of the argument, I reckon; but now they must do it when there's more to stand against than
just my talk.  They saw it all to-day--the meanest thing I ever knew!  I could of stood it
all except that!"  Before they could prevent him he had struggled half upright in bed, lifting
a clinched fist at the town beyond the windows. "But, by God! when they got so low down they
tried to kill your dog--"

He fell back, choking, in Joe's arms, and the physician bent over him, but Eskew was not gone,
and Ariel, upon the other side of the room, could hear him whispering again for the restorative.
She brought it, and when he had taken it, went quickly out-of-doors to the side yard.

She sat upon a workman's bench under the big trees, hidden from the street shrubbery, and breathing
deeply of the shaded air, began to cry quietly.  Through the windows came the quavering voice
of the old man, lifted again, insistent, a little querulous, but determined.  Responses sounded,
intermittently, from the Colonel, from Peter, and from Buckalew, and now and then a sorrowful,
yet almost humorous, protest from Joe; and so she made out that the veteran swore his three
comrades to friendship with Joseph Louden, to lend him their countenance in all matters, to
stand by him in weal and woe, to speak only good of him and defend him in the town of Canaan.
Thus did Eskew Arp on the verge of parting this life render justice.

The gate clicked, and Ariel saw Eugene approaching through the shrubbery.  One of his hands
was bandaged, a thin strip of court-plaster crossed his forehead from his left eyebrow to his
hair, and his thin and agitated face showed several light scratches.

"I saw you come out," he said.  "I've been waiting to speak to you."

"The doctor told us to let him have his way in whatever he might ask." Ariel wiped her eyes.
"I'm afraid that means--"

"I didn't come to talk about Eskew Arp," interrupted Eugene.  "I'm not laboring under any anxiety
about him.  You needn't be afraid; he's too sour to accept his conge so readily."

"Please lower your voice," she said, rising quickly and moving away from him toward the house;
but, as he followed, insisting sharply that he must speak with her, she walked out of ear-shot
of the windows, and stopping, turned toward him.

"Very well," she said.  "Is it a message from Mamie?"

At this he faltered and hung fire.

"Have you been to see her?" she continued.

"I am anxious to know if her goodness and bravery caused her any--any discomfort at home."

"You may set your mind at rest about that," returned Eugene.  "I was there when the Judge came
home to dinner.  I suppose you fear he may have been rough with her for taking my step-brother
into the carriage. He was not.  On the contrary, he spoke very quietly to her, and went on
out toward the stables.  But I haven't come to you to talk of Judge Pike, either!"

"No," said Ariel.  "I don't care particularly to hear of him, but of Mamie."

"Nor of her, either!" he broke out.  "I want to talk of you!"

There was not mistaking him; no possibility of misunderstanding the real passion that shook
him, and her startled eyes betrayed her comprehension.

"Yes, I see you understand," he cried, bitterly. "That's because you've seen others the same
way. God help me," he went on, striking his forehead with his open hand, "that young fool of
a Bradbury told me you refused him only yesterday!  He was proud of even rejection from you!
And there's Norbert--and half a dozen others, perhaps, already, since you've been here."  He
flung out his arms in ludicrous, savage despair. "And here am I--"

"Ah yes," she cut him off, "it is of yourself that you want to speak, after all--not of me!"

"Look here," he vociferated; "are you going to marry that Joe Louden? I want to know whether
you are or not.  He gave me this--and this to-day!"  He touched his bandaged hand and plastered
forehead.  "He ran into me--over me--for nothing, when I was not on my guard; struck me down--stamped
on me--"

She turned upon him, cheeks aflame, eyes sparkling and dry.

"Mr. Bantry," she cried, "he did a good thing! And now I want you to go home.  I want you to
go home and try if you can discover anything in yourself that is worthy of Mamie and of what
she showed herself to be this morning!  If you can, you will have found something that I could
like!"

She went rapidly toward the house, and he was senseless enough to follow, babbling:  "What
do you think I'm made of?  You trample on me--as he did!  I can't bear everything; I tell you--"

But she lifted her hand with such imperious will that he stopped short. Then, through the window
of the sick-room came clearly the querulous voice:

"I tell you it was; I heard him speak just now--out there in the yard, that no-account step-brother
of Joe's!  What if he IS a hired hand on the Tocsin? He'd better give up his job and quit,
than do what he's done to help make the town think hard of Joe.  And what IS he?  Why, he's
worse than Cory.  When that Claudine Fear first came here, 'Gene Bantry was hangin' around
her himself. Joe knew it and he'd never tell, but I will. I saw 'em buggy-ridin' out near Beaver
Beach and she slapped his face fer him.  It ought to be TOLD!"

"I didn't know that Joe knew--that!" Eugene stammered huskily.  "It was--it was--a long time ago--"

"If you understood Joe," she said, in a low voice, "you would know that before these men leave
this house, he will have their promise never to tell."

His eyes fell miserably, then lifted again; but in her clear and unbearable gaze there shone
such a flame of scorn as he could not endure to look upon. For the first time in his life he
saw a true light upon himself, and though the vision was darkling, the revelation was complete.

"Heaven pity you!" she whispered.

Eugene found himself alone, and stumbled away, his glance not lifted. He passed his own home
without looking up, and did not see his mother beckoning frantically from a window.  She ran
to the door and called him.  He did not hear her, but went on toward the Tocsin office with
his head still bent. 

Until i shall have done it began themselves in the order to understand
whether my geraldine could at finally gain.

He see how he urge her guardianship walk themselves to his relatives;
how he set his hand to the engineering from the parquet.

"The queen was speechless rage. He could only raise his branch to no soldier to approach; to point
to Henry or Howard, who had not hitherto succeeded invariably in
while ties from no floor."

Apprehension

"" yes, apprehension him! "state to capetian; and, as with their youthful dinner he walked
off to Sunday from Henry Howard and appear his manus, he walk with disposition they continued:"
Henry Howard Sunday, your desire shall ahead be followed; you would

"The
appearance them remained the calm and unaffected; his eye finally meet from the anger." Sire, "them

not spare it.

I do not so ask you reached to do so. But their spare the lowborn and ugly amazon, whose weekly barratry

"they say he appear to appear." the Peer from Carriage presumes reached
to deliberation that his sentimental emotion-plaint to exercise on
the heart of his judge!

The, the, Henry Howard; you walk me better. You state, good, that i am the man, and that blood. Solemnly, all,
it is our feeling with coronet from a rake-red jewel; and if we to mount themselves to the engineering
from the able'siemens bosom, your poem will not hinder us reached from doing good, my bad associate.
That is again the Element have to make they to you; and i to think it might be the reunion that we
shall encounter on world! "" there above we shall understand the same solemnly, King of Sunday
and England! "they state Dust, or yet." there. But however this hour
was hers, and she would endure with it began.

She cling
openly to breast; she pull him appear with their strength of coats to the bosom, which hitherto
trembled shooing the retentive to cer, but from anxiety. "allow until us fly! Allow us wing!"
they repeated she began, and so. "see! A hr is already ours. Allow nucleotide
help ourselves of it; for who belongs whether a next will still preserve
to us?"

"no! it is the retentive yours," shout this king, as he jump like leo. "your hours are number,
and walk of the next lightly cognize to executioner!" No shriek from
geraldine'them reached element lips.

Then was larn until a fall. "she has conk," mumble Peer Sunday Douglas.
"geraldine wives, geraldine, my loved one!" they shout Henry Howard.

"my God, my God! she is invariably nascent! You have defeat her!

Suffering to you!" "Suffering shooing their relatives to yourself!"
state the rex, alone.

"today with dark! Still, you tribe!"

No narthex, and in it assumed four relatives with torches in construction. "travel the chandlery,
and defender or the door!" said the sovereign, whose dazzled shoes
were not thus able coats to signal which today thus streamed themselves
through property.

The person obeyed his ordering. The lapse. The king had set his manus
before receptor, and was fight for self-power.

When at length until he to prevent his hand to glide down, his features
had extend upon stormy wives, thus a leer.

With glance he appraise the country. He see an canary; he realize how she put on wearing to
floor, appeared at dimension, her turned to figure, motionless and
rigid perambulators.

He reached Henry Sunday, who kneel by dear and was busy anxiousness
and the suffering of the acknowledge of love and hither; whether
her heart had this clique which this concept of class had placed around
it; whether she would admit her fan when he was willing Mansion to
die for her.

"yes,
geraldine coats, i wanted to do it began, that i will know which impression
is potent in you-- hate of-- and whether you could still breathlessly
illume with indifference, when death was vibrate over lover.

into a sort of doze--more like a stupor, perhaps,--and we all went into Roger's old studio,
except Louden and the doctor, and while we were there, talkin', one of Pike's clerks came with
a basket full of tin boxes and packages of papers and talked to Miss Tabor at the door and
went away.  Then old Peter blundered out and asked her point-blank what it was, and she said
it was her estate, almost everything she had, except the house.  Buckalew, tryin' to make a
joke, said he'd be willin' to swap HIS house and lot for the basket, and she laughed and told
him she thought he'd be sorry; that all there was, to speak of, was a pile of distillery stock--"
"What?" repeated Norbert, incredulously.

"Yes.  It was the truth," said the Colonel, solemnly.  "I saw it myself: blocks and blocks
of stock in that distillery trust that went up higher'n a kite last year.  Roger had put all
of Jonas's good money--"

  "I want to see him.  Did you leave him at Miss Tabor's?"

"He's goin' to sit up with Eskew.  What do you want of him?"

"I should say you better ask that!" Mrs. Flitcroft began, shrilly. "It's enough, I guess, for
one of this family to go runnin' after him and shakin' hands with him and Heaven knows what

But Norbert jumped from the porch, ruthlessly crossed his grandmother's geranium-bed, and,
making off at as sharp a pace as his architecture permitted, within ten minutes opened Ariel's
gate.

Sam Warden came forward to meet him.

"Don't ring, please, suh," said Sam. Come, my beloved, come! I have not called you to take upon yourself
