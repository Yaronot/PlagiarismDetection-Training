"I do not intend he shall," said the man, reaching down and picking the dog up bodily by the
scruff of his neck. "What is the matter, old fellow?" he continued, twisting the dog's head
so that he could look into his eyes. "Wanted to make a meal of me?--too bad. Your little daughter,
of course, Mr. Kling? A very good breed of dog, my dear young lady--just a little nervous,
and that is in his favor. Now, sir, make your excuses to your mistress," and he placed the
terrier in her arms. 

Professor of Psychology and Ethics Logic was the reverse of this: pedantic windbag without a trace
substance, obscene word and deed, and angry when he thought he denigrated. Did not reach at
thirty years old and had already made nine or ten chairs opposition to no avail one, only once
he had obtained a second. Outside the times when sitting in chair, not speaking of something else;
opposition from above and below, he knew the names of all professors in Spain, high school and
college, I knew how they had entered on the faculty (usually by intrigue according to him),
had an accurate count of all vacant chairs and even they were to vacate, which the opposition
played a turn or contest courts had been appointed from ten years to date, and calculated that they
could hereinafter named, and better yet who you should be named. Despite their pretensions, was
a journal that was left snuff gift, tie pins and even as it peseta by students. His name was
D. Benign, but they nicknamed him stressing Pppsicología p much as he used to do.

Professor of Physics and Natural History, Mr. Marroquín, was a former
Republican barricade, which had lost the auxiliary space at the Institute
of San Isidro for their ideas political and religious.

Throughout Spain there was no man more heterodox than himself did not believe in the mother
that bore him. D. Jaime, who was not intolerant, and the proof is holding him in his school,
had forbidden, however, to do show off their ideas, contrary to all positive religion, before
his disciples .-- "Friend Marroquín, no balzamina uzté zea in zu route; too eztamo enterao
of that Dio and holy are gun on his shoulder, but if Dad and Mom laz zuz children want to
believe it, what goes lez V. to do? Eye can, with the peak "Eztamo? Do not go to atufárseme
D. Juan (Don Juan was the priest), and have I a mess. "- By instinct conservation, rather
than later or never leaves even the enemies of God, sought Marroquín refrain, but with hard work
he succeeded. He found an ingenious way to express their grudge against the Supreme Being without
compromise, and was the omission: not by chance escaped him the name of God to replace his nature
always said, and when a boy was named, used to rectify smooth and slyly, saying: - "That is,
the forces of nature perfectly. "- was a man of tough, hairy like a boar (and he was called in
school), I went to the hair below the eyes, firm and bristling like spikes; the head were always loom
blurry scrambled by the absolute impossibility of tamed, and spent long to be best observed.
Then we shall say nothing of sows he went out of the hands and wrists, which could compete
very well with the brush rougher. When Marroquin wrote, one of the biggest jobs was to fight
with that hair of the wrist, maybe you erased the lines: I had no choice but to metérselos
each time the cuff of his shirt, but sometimes terribly impatient. These indecent hair! And angrily
tore a handful of them. "Long hair is in the soul and in the body, "he said of the chaplain of
the deaf school with anger. We are not satisfied with this trial. Marroquin was a poor devil,
not exempt from the passions that torment humans, such as envy, lust, gluttony, but not in
the highest degree most of them. However, much wandering austere man boast of a refiner, breaking
in the presence of the disciples recommendation cards and dealing with affected disdain the son
of a title, it was actually far from it, and so we have data incontrovertible.

Irreconcilable enemy of this was the chaplain D. Juan Vigil, spiritual director of students,
Christian doctrine teacher, and professor of Latin and rhetoric and poetics.
 They joost ready to

I get across at de hardvare store! Oh, I tell you, it's funny! But you know all about it. Maybe
you vunce keep a place yourself?"

"No, never."

"VOT!"

"No, I have never been in your line of trade."

"Vell, how do you know so much?"

"I know very little, but I have always enjoyed such things."

"Vell, dot's more funny yet. You vould make a lot of money if you did. Ven you get someting
for nudding you know it--I don't. You see dem--vot you call 'em--Spodes--and dot tureen, dot--"

"Lowestoft?" suggested the stranger, adjusting the mouthpiece of his pipe.

"Yes, dot Lowestoft. If you come in yesterday and say, 'Have you any olt cups and saucers and

"I should not be of the slightest value, and if you are loaning me the twenty-five dollars
on any other basis than the worth of the dressing-case, I would rather not take it."

"Oh, I have finished vid de loan. Vot I say I say." He thrust his hand into a side pocket,
from which he drew a flat wallet. "And dere is de money. I give you a receipt for de case."

"No, I do not want any receipt. I am quite willing you should keep it until I can either pay
this back or you can loan me some more on it."

"Vell, den, I don't vant no receipt for de money. Here comes a customer. Don't you go yet.
I know her. She comes most every day. She only vants to look around. Such a lot of peoples
only vants to look around. Dey don't know vat dey vant and you never have it. No, it ain't
no customer--it's Bobby."

The door was burst open, and a boy in a blue jumper, his cap thrust so far back on his head
that it was a wonder it didn't fall off, cried out:

"Say! One of the sideboards is stuck on the iron railing and we can't get it furrards or back.
Them two weiss-beers ye got down-stairs can't lift nothin' but full mugs. Send somebody to
help." And the door went to with a bang.

Kling was about to call for assistance when Hans--one of the maligned--shuffled in from the
rear of the store, carrying a wooden image very much in want of repair.

"Oh, dots awful good you brought dot! Set it here on dis chair--now you go avay and help vid
dem sideboards. See here vunce, mister. You see, dey vas makin' de altar over new, and one
of de mens come to me last week and he says: 'Mister Kling, come vid me and buy vot ve don't

sell sometings, and maybe now ve don't vant dem images.' And so I buy dem two and some olt
vestments dat my Masie make so good as new, vid patches. Now, vot can I do vid dis--?"

Again the door was burst open, shutting off all possibility for conversation. Bobby's voice
had now reached the volume of a fog-horn. "What do ye take us fur out here--lobsters? Dad and
I can't wait all day. He's got to go down to Lafayette Place for a trunk."

Kling looked at his companion, as if to see what effect the talk had had upon him, and broke
out into a suffocating chuckle. "Dot's vot it is all day long--don't you yonder I go crazy?
First it is sideboards and den it is vooden saints. 

When you get home again Uncle Manolo to help her jump out and offer cavalierly his arm to climb the
ladder. The brigadier and his son walked back.

V

That beautiful lady that enthusiasm to Miguel, the daughter of a family in Seville, as needed goods
of fortune as rich in timbres and crests. Had countless admirers some grooms and almost no
suitor. The men in this age rarely become prosaic crazy about love and marriage with Angela madness
Guevara was not holding a lot of money and good wishes to spend, because this young enlightened,
educated in the worship of his race, had it as high concept and was just so full of beauty, elegant
wit, clearing and gentleness, that no considered quite sumptuous palace, no throne high enough to
contain and sustain such sum of perfections. His entry into the theaters and rides Sevilla always
raised a murmur of admiration from the people, foreigners rushed to ask the natives: - Who is that girl?
- Would you like to V, right? - used to answer comical - as have V. care, because it is not
look at me and touches me .-- And it was true: the noble maiden passed many years (to nearly thirty),
and nobody dared to look at more than: was a superb figurehead, perhaps the best ornament,
except the Giralda, the Guadalquivir bathes city famous, but like
that, or even dared the British to take it.

And so the poor would have been up to collapse, not having arrived, committee service, Brigadier Rivera.
Angela had come on a couple discouraging skepticism: both were flirting with her eyes and tongue
without further consequences, which concluded to imagine that love was a frivolous entertainment
to avoid boredom in the gatherings, and husband (his, of course) a hypothetical being, a mystery
impossible to clear. Thus, when the brigadier, surrendered to such beauty, it was decided to
seek her hand, he delivered hastily as if a weight that bothered, and did not notice the age
difference, or the quixotic figure of the Pretender, or widowhood, or the son who was there
in Madrid: it was all nothing compared to the great problem is solved: to marry and live with
pomp at the court.

Sevilla whole rejoiced, gave a sigh of relief, exclaiming, Al finally got married!

Here they start the misfortunes of the hero of our story. As soon as the noble maiden Andalusian
stepped thresholds Rivera's house, took the keys to the cabinets and was responsible your
address, was kind enough to throw down the gauntlet. No fuss hypocrites stopped or prepared the
ground or let the time elapse even free, as do most part of stepmothers, from the first time reveals
that Michael did not like and told him war, at least had the merit of candor. He took a long
time collecting the glove. The impression that the new mother had produced was too nice to
be easily erased, and thought that an angel came from heaven for his home. Had suddenly exchanged
admiration in love, if the gentle lady who had stretched his protecting hand. But did not happen:
the new brigadiera rejected indignantly the stare of adoration Miguel was to move inn touch about
it all. Instead of thanking and feeling flattered, began to cry bitterly in the presence of
the servants: "Why look at me So this child? "Miguel did not realize at first that her stepmother
gave her pumpkins. Your child's intelligence could not realize that someone so beautiful who
abhor I had not done any harm, and persisted in his platonic love candidly. But in the end had
no choice but to perceive that he declared war, unjust war well indeed and well mixed! He felt the
thorns of that rose splendid, and was confused and embarrassed. It was a very nervous temperament
yours, it could not indifference, or loved or hated. So, after the surprise, without seeking the
reason for this antipathy, lent his love trocose hatred. And a few days brigadiera Angela, if
you wanted to, could see the eyes of Miguel not express any kind of worship.

Kindled more with this ill-will of it, the war broke out with all its horrors, relentlessly and
without mercy. If Michael went for a walk with the groom, the piercing eyes of Andalusian ever
discovered around in costume some slick, some seven bad recosido :--«¡ a pious servant Jesus,
what child Susie and ma ma naughty! What people say you see? I say drop him and let him go like
a beggar. It is a vergüensa! "If stayed home and played with the servants, the lady was furious,
he had a headache, talked about the baseness of feelings that the boy showed, paving to be provided
the servants, and harshly rebuked brigadier because he could not raise his son. If, to please
his father, took the decision to sit still in a chair and sentadito all afternoon, this was
what I could see the amazement of Seville :--«¡ which child Jesus so postmodern! Always on the
slopes of a Miskito, looking around, observing everything! ... Oh, what fatigue! "

Neither was easy, as shown, to give him pleasure in anything. Brigadier suffered a lot with this unjustified
aversion and tried to mitigate it, to no avail. We needed passion to his wife crazy inspired him
to be peaceful, so sometimes there was not a scandal home. Relatives, as it took over what had
happened, showed much displeasure. The most indignant was Uncle Manolo :--«¡ The day I see that
petenera mistreat my nephew - had that in a certain house, - and not cover their ears with wax will
hear wonderful things! " And it happened as planned. The brigadiera that one did not attempt
to do what seemed to him, angrily chided Michael in his presence, and among other insults committed
the way of calling bad breed. Hear this and go crazy Uncle Manolo, was all one, for miracle
did not end right there with her sister. Yet he grabbed her tightly by the arm and releasing
three or four suits followed, spat over who said: "Hear thou, great banner; caste is better
than yours seven thousand times ... What would become of you if you had not henpecked married to
my brother? So pay the good you have done, insulting him and all of us? ... Look, girl, that
the future of your kind would have been worn as there is God ... You were in water up to neck,
poorer than spiders, and you still come casting fierce? ... V. If I tell, man, that is hilarious!
... What a brother babieca I have! ... Babieca! ... More than babieca !...»

The brigadiera, instant response from the shock, it stirred angry
and threw three or four ferocious insults and then had the fainting
fit.

Uncle Manolo breaking out of the cabinet doors and swear. Found himself on the stairs to his
brother, and facing him, said: "It seems incredible that with such mustache brings you lined your
cursilona woman! The day I set foot back in your house, bury me alive! "

And without waiting for an answer from the astonished brigadier, breaks
down into four steps and disappeared.

The beautiful Andalusian achieved shortly after alienating all the relatives of her husband, and
what is worse, it hardly deal with them. Instead they began to frequent the house enough members
of the colony Seville Guevara family friends: most ladies and girls. Among the latter the most
intimate and regular population was Lucia, that young blond D. Manuel de Rivera health Miguel
Prado being in their company. The biographical details he had given
to his nephew were accurate.

Lucia had no fortune, lived to adhere to a state pension that paid him for being his father
regent of the Audiencia of Puerto Rico. Connected and related by his mother even with several
aristocratic families of Seville and Madrid, enjoyed, but not possess, the Wellness and splendor
that the money sought. Since he had lost his father, his rich relatives had been kind enough
to invite her to eat frequently and take theater and walk. In the seventeen years he also lost
his mother and was collected by the Marquis de Cisneros, established closest relatives in Madrid.
As Lucia was a young beautiful, discreet and polite, and as, moreover, had ten or twelve thousand
actual orphans, was very light load for those gentlemen, who had only two children and enjoyed
good income. Sevilla had been very close to the Guevara family, and in particular Angelita,
though this is the advantage in seven or eight years old at least. Cooled little separation
relations, re-heated as soon as they were in Madrid. Shortly after arriving at Angela, her
friend just left the house but sleeping; or to walk, or a play, or
even left out mass together.

Lucia was a blonde of those commonly steamy, clear blue eyes and a little wet smooth white forehead,
hair like golden skeins, eyebrows shaped in an arc, something aquiline, thin waist and slender,
her face happy and very peaceful. Her beauty was happy contrast to the brigadiera, perhaps not this
was the most solid foundation of friendship. Also differed significantly in the mood. Angela
was dismissive, irascible, quite unable to relent, a friend of the pleasures of the table above
all others. Lucia was romantic weepy, with touches of writers, friends have dreams and premonitions,
very talkative, cunning, and dowsing to explain the mysteries and intricacies of the heart, just
ate. In such a diversity of body and spirit was born the agreement between them existed. Angela
sent on Lucia, but on the condition of hearing, which was hard for him not; exercised a protectorate
over her maternal. Lucia herself pitied her friend be so ignorant of the ineffable pleasures of
poetry and love, and this mutual appreciation and contempt both geniuses
agreed and lived alone.

Lucia immediately noticed her friend's dislike for the stepchild, and tried to overcome it gently;
they found no basis for it. Miguel recalled after man's beauty this lady is not impressed him
as her stepmother, but the love he showed and genial and expansive nature, they concluded, however,
leave you captivated. One day, just married his father, the two friends chatted while he played
in a corner, should refer the conversation to him, because he looked
both cases, the mother with severe and scornful eyes, Lucia gently.

-
Come here, Mickey - suddenly it said.

Miguel went to appeal. The nice lady I asked a few questions of little substance, and after taking
him by the beard and looking intently, said, as if you tie the thread into a conversation started:

-
Well, this guy is not ugly, Angela!

The brigadiera silent. Miguel, who already had more insight of what is included, understood who
had been his face on the table, and thanked all his life to the lace Seville this good opinion.

Again
his new mom, whose antipathy was always increasing, he was punished
for breaking play the ball a toilet had given him at his wedding.

Let them fall locked in the room order wardrobe with the servants that under no circumstances
give him the tea, and went visiting with her husband. He arrived a little later Miss Population
and learning that no one was home more than Michael, and he plunged into a dark dungeon, was
pleased to get it, in spite of warnings from the maids, who feared his wife more than the
same demon. Brought him to the dining room, made of tea and give him and greeted him courteously
touched. From this and other favors was Miguel debtor to this lady while in the parental home
and always had them in mind.

In brigadiera he had made up his mind to marry his girlfriend, and
marry her advantage.

As Miguel was very young and did not attempt it, he heard several conversations about this
point to ever received the name of the boyfriend that her mother intended. All the kind lady
was unsuitable, swore he would marry only when should find the husband she had seen in dreams
or at least more than he liked. This answer the brigadiera that was not silly, it was all heavenly
music and the important thing was to get married a man capable of keeping it in the category and welfare
had always enjoyed. Say not cast his flowing blond unheeded advice from his good friend and even
that He took advantage. But this will be seen later.

One year after marrying his wife gave him the brigadier, as a result
of blessing, a beautiful girl was christened with the name of Julia,
was strengthening disaster for the poor Miguel, although so innocent.

As a star of first magnitude, others dark and irrational rational beings of the house, and became
the center of attention and care, and issue all speeches. In the days following birth Miguel
lived completely ignored, making As well he was happy, enjoying a blissful quiet. Unfortunately, it
did not last. Black pupils the brigadiera they soon fall back upon him, and behind those eyes
stirred Now a thought so selfish and petty as consistent with our weak nature. That little boy in
front of him was to deprive his beautiful and beloved daughter of one half of fortune at least.
This thought always fixed, always present in the brain is not very strong the brigadiera, exasperate
reached the point that soon became the home of monarchy absolute, but discreet, which was,
in fierce and insufferable despotism. The same Brigadier, that had taken great pride in not
ever having ruled against existing institutions was on the brink of revolt with all the trimmings,
represented by Michael and three or four servants old. And as the rope breaks always the thinnest,
the garrison suffered more in this head set that's worth. After frequent clashes, ambushes,
skirmishes and battles to brigadiera pitched in that he proved to be consummate strategic
certainly much higher her husband would not ever mid-general, the three old faithful servers
were given the absolute, and Michael ... it is also given. Let's see how.

Julia had two years or so. It was a lovely girl, who laughed to break a tendon when any object falling
to the floor, and mom and dad said correctly and properly. At the same time showed happy and exceptional
provisions for classical music.

When his father's booming voice of choristers sang with the bass aria or serenade Lucrezia Borgia Faust,
she was tender, was beginning to pout, and conclude by mourn frantically not first give the
brigadiera preventive voice: "Will you shut up, Fernando?"

You can not deny, however, that Julia professed some misconceptions about grammatical rules and the value
of words. For example, what reason could have to call to meat and
chicha Tita nanny, naming Felisa?

We fully understand that quis quis say cheese demand: here, at least, there is a real root
of the word. Its views on the instincts and character of domestic animals were equally absurd.
Over unspeakably exaggerating the power and ferocity of the chickens, avoiding them with cries
of terror, kept alive and profound sympathy to the cats, which could not destroyed by the frequent
scrapes that these ungrateful creatures inflicted on his tender little hands. So faced with a losing
our chabeta Julia, and shouting with the sweetness a Mockingbird "Dad, I suck! Dad, I suck!
"Went to him and grabbed him by the tail. At the same more than cats, or perhaps a little higher,
Julita placed his brother Michael, who called Michel. It was a blind affection which he had: the
same was him, that his arms are agitated joy, joy sparkled eyes and asked with all the force of
his lungs to bring in Michel, or give him to her death. So I was near, he threw for the hair to
mourn him, in admiration, or slime filled his face. Michael, more gallant than cats, not only kept
pulling the hairs with the patience of a martyr, but so eagerly sought the occasion of martyrdom.
With a generosity that there are very few examples in history, not only forgive his sister his fierce
caresses but also abuse and tasteless that because it was bound to suffer. Because brigadiera
could not bear with patience this sympathy, is angry with his daughter when asked to bring him
to Michael without delay, and more when he, on his own initiative, the came to give her a kiss.
Teníale formally prohibited from taking on arms, play with it, and general approach when you
will not send, but we Miguel, braving the wrath of the brigadiera few times, and laughing at his watch,
spent time with her, making antics to see laughing, or stroking good.

One morning, Julia was very sprawled on his cot, staring at the ceiling. The nanny had left
her alone by going to frolic in the kitchen. His face gave a severity unusual, his eyes motionless,
static, her lips folded reflection signal, hands resting quietly on his belly. It seemed that
was embedded in a fantastic meditation. From time to time up a little hand and snapped the tongue,
which he stated his profound melancholy meditation said sometimes
low and husky voice: "Upa, upa!"

Carried away by the whirlwind of ideas very sad, no doubt had completed to mourn and cry out desperately,
if the environment a little view of the door had not seen in her beautifully groomed hair and
his brother Miguel.

- Michel, Michel! - Said out of his stupor painful and it's arms extending toward naked.

Miguel went to her looking all around like a thief who fears being caught. Al were instantly confused
the two in a tight embrace, which was Miguel hug completely disheveled, his face full of slime and
no tie. Julita the sign waving triumph.

The boy, who had suffered all too eagerly that asease the maid, now
allowed very accommodating to her sister unkempt, and bringing her
lips, asked softly:

- Say, do you want, sweetie?

The girl turned to throw the hair and face sobarle the faith of eternal love.

- Who do you love more, me or Tita?

- Michel, Michel - Julita said, bringing to him and giving him an
angry punch in the neck.

And not content with this clear demonstration continued with emphasis:

- Tita feya ... Michel apo.

Miguel alienated passionately kissed his sister's arms.

Then he asked:

- Do you want to eat?

Having acquiesced Julita with a dozen nods, the boy began to appear
that he ate the arms, face, chest, legs, in short, all the tiny person.

The girl breaks into joy at being devoured by such a gentle way.

-
Would you like more?

Course. Julia wanted to eat it up no trace of her.

The tiger, so was completed, he rested a few moments on the same
pillow of his victim.

Is still tore the breast meat by the handful to offer it.

- Listen,
Julita, how does a cat?

- Mau Mau!

- Ca! Otherwise, you'll like it.

And getting on all fours, began to spin around the room, throwing such and so true meows, which
was suspended and static Julita, believing themselves to have before and actually an individual
of the feline race.

As there was something to pass such a timely opportunity to make
to know their benevolent feelings toward this family, said with deep
conviction:

- Mamo, apo.

Michael came triumphantly to her, and kissed her.

- You want water, Monin? - Asked suddenly.

We do not know what kind of reasons have led Michael to provide water as spontaneously his sister.
Whatever they want, the truth is that like I could not refuse him anything, he accepted the
offer. But when serving good Miguel, dropped into the cradle the glass full. The girl was three
times as many to mourn and to laugh, he finally decided on the latter, finding very funny, but too
humid, the joke of his brother.

To reward tolerance, it became to make the cat even more will and
skill.

After imitated dog and donkey less than moderately. Finally, wanting to end in a dignified and brilliant
zoological work, proposed to make the chicken. All antipathies, terrors and resentments Julita
awoke to hear this unfortunate name.

- No. .. ina no ... feya ina!

But Miguel, drawn from the desire to show off their skills in this
new year, would not meet the refusal, and began to cluck a great time
in all the treble and bass.

The girl, agitated, convulsed, his eyes terrified, screaming ever louder,

- No. .. ina no ...!

Feya, feya!

It was necessary to finish. The artist he stood looking somewhat sulky despised their efforts.

-
Upa, upa - the girl said after a pause, tending to Miguel's arms.

- No, do not get up, that scolds mom.

- Valiente thing that matters to me mama fight! - Said the girl, that is, should say, in fact did
nothing but repeat a gesture that resulted in reply:

- Upa, upa!

Miguel had. When he found himself picked her up with a soup that was made. The damned glass!
The thought of his stepmother gave him goose bumps.

Was because such thinking suddenly deprived him of the forces, or
they never would have been very Herculean, is it true that out of
the crib, not knowing how the girl slipped from her arms, and fell
with a loud whack with his chin on the railing.

Oh gracious God! What happened there? Julita's blood ran in abundance, the screams heard in a
half mile radius. The servants came, and the doorman, and neighbors, and Street municipal police,
and medical-aid, and the guard of Principal Artillery and police force, and what is even more frightening
than this ... came the brigadiera.

On the same night the war council, chaired by the former, condemned
inmate named Miguel Rivera to six years imprisonment with retention,
to be purged in a large building, ugly and dirty, located in Dodsworth
Street characters that read blurred this label: College 1. Nd and
2. ª education under the patronage of Our Lady of Mercy. 

VI

So
it was that big dirty inside and out, teaching and food that was corresponded
very well with the locals. The founder and director of the institution
was a excoronel Andalusian artillery and Guevara family friend, which
is why Michael had gone to there with their bones. The colonel just
called D. Jaime, had left the body on a matter of honor that theirs
had not been sure footing, had some words with another officer of
engineers, sponsors were appointed, and when it was formalized during
the challenge, our D. Jaime was bailed and given every satisfaction,
the gunners were offended a lot with this behavior, stopped to greet,
and the colonel was forced out to seek the absolute.

"Yes, seven would have to be the hour, Mr. Kling" said O'Day.

"Vell, make it seven o'clock, den."

"And if," he continued in a still more serious voice, "I should on certain days--absent myself
entirely, would that matter?"

Otto was being slowly driven into a corner, but he determined not to flinch with Kitty standing
by. "No, I tink I git along vid my little Beesvings."

O'Day studied the pavement for an instant, then looked into space as if seeking to clear his
mind of every conflicting thought, and said at last, slowly and deliberately: "Very well. Then
I will be with you in the morning at nine o'clock. After to
shout a while to open up the watchman came and accompanied them with the lantern to the main floor.
There the servant, still half asleep, I gave each one the key to his room and fired until the next
day.

Uncle Manolo, serene, majestic, godlike, he went to rest, meditate
and Ulises death of the suitors.

XI

Since Miguel commissioned business management Uncle Manolo (and did a few days after having spent
what we have to tell), she did not feel it in your soul that noble impulse that drew him to
worship the household gods. Perhaps judged incompatible diligent guardian over the duties imposed
the yoke of marriage, preferring to sacrifice the benefit of his nephew the ineffable pleasures
with which the family gave him. Truth is, who sought revenge honest with laudable diligence applied
to the joys own Bachelor. He was not behind in this Michael, encouraged by their example: they
both started to be happily enjoying life princes of the seven thousand dollars of income Brigadier
had left, theaters, dances, trips, dinners at the last minute of game items and game nights love
and debauchery, all enjoyed the hero of our story in the four years following the death of his father.
His inclination to study suffered significant impairment during this time; however, ended the race
with regular shine.

Once in possession of law degree not re-opened a law book, the moments that the pleasure he
was free consagrábalos to read entertaining works, which was also a pleasure.

Upon reaching the older he got the idea to hold accountable his uncle had seen in Recently some
difficulties touching the cash, which brought him into suspicion. Which had the sense to see
turned into certainties, his uncle and he had spent in the four years,
not only the annual income of seven thousand dollars, but the corresponding
capital fifty thousand pieces was placed on the Bank's actions and
role of the state, not there were only three urban properties. How many pieces have you?"
