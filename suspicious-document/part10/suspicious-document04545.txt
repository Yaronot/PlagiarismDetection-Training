This was certainly an important communication, and one to which Alaric found it very difficult
to give any immediate answer. He said a great deal about his affection for Mrs. Woodward, of
his admiration for Miss Woodward, of his strong sense of Captain Cuttwater's kindness, and
of his own unworthiness; but he left the captain with an impression that he was not prepared

He are therefore to be coerce to come this decision that did a practice whom has had to do reeking
heiress.
 Those
were the thoughts that passed through Mrs. Woodward's heart as she sat there caressing Linda.
But how were things to be managed now at the present moment? It was quite clear that the wolf
in sheep's clothing must be admitted into the pastoral family; either that, or the fairest
lamb of the flock must be turned out altogether, to take upon herself lupine nature, and roam
the woods a beast of prey. As matters stood it behoved them to make such a sheep of Alaric
as might be found practicable.

And so Mrs. Woodward set to work to teach her daughter how best she might conduct herself in
her present state of wretchedness. She had to bear with her sister's success, to listen to
her sister's joy, to enter into all her future plans, to assist at her toilet, to prepare her
wedding garments, to hear the congratulations of friends, and take a sister's share in a sister's
triumph, and to do this without once giving vent to a reproach. And she had worse than this
to do; she had to encounter Alaric, and to wish him joy of his bride; she had to protect her
female pride from the disgrace which a hopeless but acknowledged love would throw on it; she
had to live in the house with Alaric as though he were her brother, and as though she had never
thought to live with him in any nearer tie. She would have to stand at the altar as her sister's
bridesmaid, and see them married, and she would have to smile and be cheerful as she did so.

This was the lesson which Mrs. Woodward had now to teach her daughter; and she so taught it
that Linda did all that circumstances and her mother required of her. Late on that afternoon
she went to Gertrude, and, kissing her, wished her joy. At that moment Gertrude was the more
embarrassed of the two.

'Linda, dear Linda,' she said, embracing her sister convulsively.

'I hope you will be happy, Gertrude, with all my heart,' said Linda; and so she relinquished
her lover.

We talk about the weakness of women--and Linda Woodward was, in many a way, weak enough--but
what man, what giant, has strength equal to this? It was not that her love was feeble. Her
heart was capable of truest love, and she had loved Alaric truly. But she had that within her
which enabled her to overcome herself, and put her own heart, and hopes, and happiness--all
but her maiden pride--into the background, when the hopes and happiness of another required it.

She still shared the same room with her sister; and those who know how completely absorbed
a girl is by her first acknowledged love, may imagine how many questions she had to answer,
to how many propositions she was called to assent, for how many schemes she had to vouchsafe
a sister's interest, while her heart was telling her that she should have been the questioner,
she should have been the proposer, that the schemes should all have been her own.

But she bore it bravely. When Alaric first came down, which he did in the middle of the week,
she was, as she told her mother, too weak to stand in his presence. Her mother strongly advised
her not to absent herself; so she sat gently by, while he kissed Mrs. Woodward and Katie. She
sat and trembled, for her turn she knew must come. It did come; Alaric, with an assurance which
told more for his courage than for his heart, came up to her, and with a smiling face offered
her his hand. She rose up and muttered some words which she had prepared for the occasion,
and he, still holding her by the hand, stooped down and kissed her cheek. Mrs. Woodward looked
on with an angry flush on her brow, and hated him for his cold-hearted propriety of demeanour.

Linda went up to her mother's room, and, sitting on her mother's bed, sobbed herself into tranquillity.

It was very grievous to Mrs. Woodward to have to welcome Alaric to her house. They did compose

Charley, therefore, wrote to Norman, telling him that he could remain in his old home, and
humbly asking permission to remain there with him. To this request he received a kind rejoinder
in the affirmative. Though Charley was related to Alaric, there had always apparently been
a closer friendship between him and Norman than between the two cousins; and now, in his fierce
unbridled quarrel with Alaric, and in his present coolness with the Woodwards, he seemed to
turn to Charley with more than ordinary affection.

Norman made his appearance at the office on the first Monday of the new year. He had hitherto
sat at the same desk with Alaric, each of them occupying one side of it; on his return he found
himself opposite to a stranger. Alaric had, of course, been promoted to a room of his own.

The Weights and Measures had never been a noisy office; but now it became more silent than
ever. Men there talked but little at any time, and now they seemed to cease from talking altogether.
It was known to all that the Damon and Pythias of the establishment were Damon and Pythias
no longer; that war waged between them, and that if all accounts were true, they were ready
to fly each at the other's throat. Some attributed this to the competitive examination; others
said it was love; others declared that it was money, the root of evil; and one rash young gentleman
stated his positive knowledge that it was all three. At any rate something dreadful was expected;
and men sat anxious at their desks, fearing the coming evil.

On the Monday the two men did not meet, nor on the Tuesday. On the next morning, Alaric, having
acknowledged to himself the necessity of breaking the ice, walked into the room where Norman
sat with three or four others. It was absolutely necessary that he should make some arrangement
with him as to a certain branch of office-work; and though it was competent for him, as the
superior, to have sent for Norman as the inferior, he thought it best to abstain from doing
so, even though he were thereby obliged to face his enemy, for the first time, in the presence
of others.

'Well, Mr. Embryo,' said he, speaking to the new junior, and standing with his back to the
fire in an easy way, as though there was nothing wrong under the sun, or at least nothing at
the Weights and Measures, 'well, Mr. Embryo, how do you get on with those calculations?'

'Pretty well, I believe, sir; I think I begin to understand them now,' said the tyro, producing
for Alaric's gratification five or six folio sheets covered with intricate masses of figures.

'Ah! yes; that will do very well,' said Alaric, taking up one of the sheets, and looking at
it with an assumed air of great interest. Though he acted his part pretty well, his mind was
very far removed from Mr. Embryo's efforts.

Norman sat at his desk, as black as a thunder-cloud, with his eyes turned intently at the paper
before him; but so agitated that he could not even pretend to write.

'By the by, Norman,' said Alaric, 'when will it suit you to look through those Scotch papers
with me?'

'My name, sir, is Mr. Norman,' said Harry, getting up and standing by his chair with all the
firmness of a Paladin of old.

'With all my heart,' said Alaric. 'In speaking to you I can have but one wish, and that is
to do so in any way that may best please you.'

'Any instructions you may have to give I will attend to, as far as my duty goes,' said Norman.

And then Alaric, pushing Mr. Embryo from his chair without much ceremony, sat down opposite
to his former friend, and said and did what he had to say and do with an easy unaffected air,
in which there was, at any rate, none of the usual superciliousness of a neophyte's authority.
Norman was too agitated to speak reasonably, or to listen calmly, but Alaric knew that though
he might not do so to-day, he would to-morrow, or if not to-morrow, then the next day; and
so from day to day he came into Norman's room and transacted his business. Mr. Embryo got accustomed
to looking through the window at the Council Office for the ten minutes that he remained there,
and Norman also became reconciled to the custom. And thus, though they never met in any other
way, they daily had a kind of intercourse with each other, which, at last, contrived to get
itself arranged into a certain amount of civility on both sides.

Immediately that Norman's arrival was heard of at Surbiton Cottage, Mrs. Woodward hastened
up to town to see him. She wrote to him to say that she would be at his lodgings at a certain
hour, and begged him to come thither to her. Of course he did not refuse, and so they met.
Mrs. Woodward had much doubted whether or no she would take Linda or Katie with her, but at
last she resolved to go alone. Harry, she thought, would be more willing to speak freely to
her, to open his heart to her, if there were nobody by but herself.

Clementina Golightly was, in the common parlance of a large portion of mankind, a 'doosed fine
gal.' She stood five feet six, and stood very well, on very good legs, but with rather large
feet. She was as straight as a grenadier, and had it been her fate to carry a milk-pail, she
would have carried it to perfection. Instead of this, however, she was permitted to expend
an equal amount of energy in every variation of waltz and polka that the ingenuity of the dancing
professors of the age has been able to produce. Waltzes and polkas suited her admirably; for
she was gifted with excellent lungs and perfect powers of breathing, and she had not much delight
in prolonged conversation. Her fault, if she had one, was a predilection for flirting; but
she did her flirtations in a silent sort of way, much as we may suppose the fishes do theirs,
whose amours we may presume to consist in swimming through their cool element in close contiguity
with each other. 'A feast of reason and a flow of soul' were not the charms by which Clementina
Golightly essayed to keep her admirers spell-bound at her feet. To whirl rapidly round a room
at the rate of ten miles an hour, with her right hand outstretched in the grasp of her partner's,
and to know that she was tightly buoyed up, like a horse by a bearing-rein, by his other hand
behind her back, was for her sufficient. To do this, as she did do it, without ever crying
for mercy, with no slackness of breath, and apparently without distress, must have taken as
much training as a horse gets for a race. But the training had in nowise injured her; and now,
having gone through her gallops and run all her heats for three successive seasons, she was
still sound of wind and limb, and fit to run at any moment when called upon.

We have said nothing about the face of the beauteous Clementina, and indeed nothing can be
said about it. There was no feature in it with which a man could have any right to find fault;
that she was a 'doosed fine girl' was a fact generally admitted; but nevertheless you might
look at her for four hours consecutively on a Monday evening, and yet on Tuesday you would
not know her. She had hair which was brownish and sufficiently silky--and which she wore, as
all other such girls do, propped out on each side of her face by thick round velvet pads, which,
when the waltzing pace became exhilarating, occasionally showed themselves, looking greasy.
She had a pair of eyes set straight in her head, faultless in form, and perfectly inexpressive.
She had a nose equally straight, but perhaps a little too coarse in dimensions. She had a mouth
not over large, with two thin lips and small whitish teeth; and she had a chin equal in contour
to the rest of her face, but on which Venus had not deigned to set a dimple. Nature might have
defied a French passport officer to give a description of her, by which even her own mother
or a detective policeman might have recognized her.

When to the above list of attractions it is added that Clementina Golightly had L20,000 of
her own, and a reversionary interest in her mother's jointure, it may be imagined that she

Lady Howlaway is waiting for me this moment; but I must settle with you about the June flower-show.'

'Oh! thank you, Mrs. Scott, don't trouble yourself about me,' said Gertrude; 'I don't think
I shall go.'

'Oh! nonsense, my dear; of course you'll go; it's the show of the year, and the Grand duke
is to be there--baby is all right now, you know; I must not hear of your not going.'

 Morning after morning
he would wait in that hated room; and then day after day, at two o'clock, he would attend the
usurer's city haunt--and generally all in vain. The patience of Mr. Snape was giving way, and
the discipline even of the Internal Navigation felt itself outraged.

And now Charley stood once more in that dingy little front parlour in which he had never yet
seen a fire, and once more Mr. Jabesh M'Ruen shuffled into the room in his big cravat and dirty
loose slippers.

'How d'ye do, Mr. Tudor, how d'ye do? I hope you have brought a little of this with you;' and
Jabesh opened out his left hand, and tapped the palm of it with the middle finger of his right,
by way of showing that he expected some money: not that he did expect any, cormorant that he
was; this was not the period of the quarter in which he ever got money from his customer.

'Indeed I have not, Mr. M'Ruen; but I positively must get some.'

'Oh--oh--oh--oh--Mr. Tudor--Mr. Tudor! How can we go on if you are so unpunctual? Now I would
do anything for you if you would only be punctual.'

'Oh! bother about that--you know your own game well enough.'

'Be punctual, Mr. Tudor, only be punctual, and we shall be all right--and so you have not got
any of this?' and Jabesh went through the tapping again.

'Not a doit,' said Charley; 'but I shall be up the spout altogether if you don't do something
to help me.'

'But you are so unpunctual, Mr. Tudor.'

'Oh, d--- it; you'll make me sick if you say that again. What else do you live by but that?
But I positively must have some money from you to-day. If not I am done for.'

'I don't think I can, Mr. Tudor; not to-day, Mr. Tudor--some other day, say this day month;
that is, if you'll be punctual.'

'This day month! no, but this very day, Mr. M'Ruen--why, you got L18 from me when I received
my last salary, and I have not had a shilling back since.'

'But you are so unpunctual, Mr. Tudor,' and Jabesh twisted his head backwards and forwards
within his cravat, rubbing his chin with the interior starch.

'Well, then, I'll tell you what it is,' said Charley, 'I'll be shot if you get a shilling from
me on the 1st of October, and you may sell me up as quick as you please. If I don't give a
history of your business that will surprise some people, my name isn't Tudor.'

'Ha, ha, ha!' laughed Mr. M'Ruen, with a soft quiet laugh.

'Well, really, Mr. Tudor, I would do more for you than any other young man that I know, if
you were only a little more punctual. How much is it you want now?'

'L15--or L10--L10 will do.'

'Ten pounds!' said Jabesh, as though Charley had asked for ten thousand--'ten pounds!--if two
or three would do--'

'But two or three won't do.'

'And whose name will you bring?'

'Whose name! why Scatterall's, to be sure.' Now Scatterall was one of the navvies; and from
him Mr. M'Ruen had not yet succeeded in extracting one farthing, though he had his name on
a volume of Charley's bills.

'Scatterall--I don't like Mr. Scatterall,' said Jabesh; 'he is very dissipated, and the most
unpunctual young man I ever met-- you really must get some one else, Mr. Tudor; you really must.'

'Oh, that's nonsense--Scatterall is as good as anybody--I couldn't ask any of the other fellows--they

 He had bespoken for himself a bedroom at the public-house in Norfolk Street,
and had he once taken up his residence there he would have been ruined for ever.

He was still living with Norman, and ever increasing his debt. In his misery at this state
of affairs, he had talked over with Harry all manner of schemes for increasing his income,
but he had never told him a word about Mr. M'Ruen. Why his salary, which was now L150 per annum,
should not be able to support him, Norman never asked. Charley the while was very miserable,
and the more miserable he was, the less he found himself able to rescue himself from his dissipation.
What moments of ease he had were nearly all spent in Norfolk Street; and such being the case
how could he abstain from going there?

'Well, Charley, and how do 'Crinoline and Macassar' go on?' said Norman, as they sauntered
away together up the towing-path above Putney. Now there were those who had found out that
Charley Tudor, in spite of his wretched, idle, vagabond mode of life, was no fool; indeed,
that there was that talent within him which, if turned to good account, might perhaps redeem
him from ruin and set him on his legs again; at least so thought some of his friends, among
whom Mrs. Woodward was the most prominent. She insisted that if he would make use of his genius
he might employ his spare time to great profit by writing for magazines or periodicals; and,
inspirited by so flattering a proposition, Charley had got himself introduced to the editor
of a newly- projected publication. At his instance he was to write a tale for approval, and
'Crinoline and Macassar' was the name selected for his first attempt.

The affair had been fully talked over at Hampton, and it had been arranged that the young author
should submit his story, when completed, to the friendly criticism of the party assembled at
Surbiton Cottage, before he sent it to the editor. He had undertaken to have 'Crinoline and
Macassar' ready for perusal on the next Saturday, and in spite of Mr. M'Ruen and Norah Geraghty,
he had really been at work.

'Will it be finished by Saturday, Charley?' said Norman.

'Yes--at least I hope so; but if that's not done, I have another all complete.'

'Another! and what is that called?'

'Oh, that's a very short one,' said Charley, modestly.

'But, short as it is, it must have a name, I suppose. What's the name of the short one?'

'Why, the name is long enough; it's the longest part about it. The editor gave me the name,
you know, and then I had to write the story. It's to be called "Sir Anthony Allan-a-dale and
the Baron of Ballyporeen."'

'Oh! two rival knights in love with the same lady, of course,' and Harry gave a gentle sigh
as he thought of his own still unhealed grief. 'The scene is laid in Ireland, I presume?'

'No, not in Ireland; at least not exactly. I don't think the scene is laid anywhere in particular;
it's up in a mountain, near a castle. There isn't any lady in it--at least, not alive.'

'Heavens, Charley! I hope you are not dealing with dead women.'

'No--that is, I have to bring them to life again. I'll tell you how it is. And none did more pique him

The--. Chap. Demonstrate what mamma she utilize t evaporated about deployment to waightie vioag

.
 Mrs. Davis was neither
young nor beautiful, nor more than ordinarily witty. Charley, it is true, had an allurement
to entice him thither, but this could not be said of Scatterall, to whom the lovely Norah was
never more than decently civil. Had they been desired, in their own paternal halls, to sit
and see their mother's housekeeper darn the family stockings, they would, probably, both of
them have rebelled, even though the supply of tobacco and gin and water should be gratuitous
and unlimited.

It must be presumed that the only charm of the pursuit was in its acknowledged impropriety.
They both understood that there was something fast in frequenting Mrs. Davis's inner parlour,
something slow in remaining at home; and so they both sat there, and Mrs. Davis went on with
her darning-needle, nothing abashed.

'Well, I think I shall go,' said Scatterall, shaking off the last ash from the end of his third
cigar.

'Do,' said Charley; 'you should be careful, you know; late hours will hurt your complexion.'

'It's so deuced dull,' said Scatterall.

'Why don't you go into the parlour, and have a chat with the gentlemen?' suggested Mrs. Davis;
'there's Mr. Peppermint there now, lecturing about the war; upon my word he talks very well.'

'He's so deuced low,' said Scatterall.

'He's a bumptious noisy blackguard too,' said Charley; 'he doesn't know how to speak to a gentleman,
when he meets one.'

Scatterall gave a great yawn. 'I suppose you're not going, Charley?' said he.

'Oh yes, I am,' said Charley, 'in about two hours.'

'Two hours! well, good night, old fellow, for I'm off. Three cigars, Mrs. Davis, and two goes
of gin and water, the last cold.' Then, having made this little commercial communication to
the landlady, he gave another yawn, and took himself away. Mrs. Davis opened her little book,
jotted down the items, and then, having folded up her stockings, and put them into a basket,
prepared herself for conversation.

But, though Mrs. Davis prepared herself for conversation, she did not immediately commence
it. Having something special to say, she probably thought that she might improve her opportunity
of saying it by allowing Charley to begin. She got up and pottered about the room, went to
a cupboard, and wiped a couple of glasses, and then out into the bar and arranged the jugs
and pots. This done, she returned to the little room, and again sat herself down in her chair.

'Here's your five pounds, Mrs. Davis,' said Charley; 'I wish you knew the trouble I have had
to get it for you.'

To give Mrs. Davis her due, this was not the subject on which she was anxious to speak. She
would have been at present well inclined that Charley should remain her debtor. 'Indeed, Mr.
Tudor, I am very sorry you should have taken any trouble on such a trifle. If you're short
of money, it will do for me just as well in October.'

Charley looked at the sovereigns, and bethought himself how very short of cash he was. Then
he thought of the fight he had had to get them, in order that he might pay the money which
he had felt so ashamed of having borrowed, and he determined to resist the temptation.

'Did you ever know me flush of cash? Scenery was emptied of Gertrude: certainly by Bella, and there

 From the Opera Colonnade shrill voices

whose voice had perished in the night air, croaked out at him the offer of a vehicle; and one
of the night beggar-women who cling like burrs to those who roam the street a these unhallowed
hours still stuck to him, as she had done ever since he had entered the Strand.

'Get away with you,' said Charley, turning at the wretched creature in his fierce anger; 'get

'That you may never know what it is to be in misery yourself!' said the miserable Irishwoman.

'If you follow me a step farther I'll have you locked up,' said Charley.

'Oh, then, it's you that have the hard heart,' said she; 'and it's you that will suffer yet.'

Charley looked round, threw her the odd halfpence which he had in his pocket, and then turned
down towards the column. The woman picked up her prize, and, with a speedy blessing, took herself
off in search of other prey.

His way home would have taken him up Waterloo Place, but the space round the column was now

'It will be safer to take the one to the left,' said Harry.

'Oh! there's lots of tune,' said Charley.

'No,' said Harry,' do as I tell you and go to the left.--Pull your left hand a little, Katie.'

Charley did as he was bid, and Katie intended to do the same; but unfortunately she pulled
the wrong hand. They were now very near the bridge, and the barge was so close to them as to
show that there might have been danger in attempting to get through the same arch with her.

'Your left hand, Katie, your left,' shouted Norman; 'your left string.' Katie was confused,
and gave first a pull with her right, and then a pull with her left, and then a strong pull
with her right. The two men backed water as hard as they could, but the effect of Katie's steering
was to drive the nose of the boat right into one of the wooden piers of the bridge.

The barge went on its way, and luckily made its entry under the arch before the little craft
had swung round into the stream before it; as it was, the boat, still clinging by its nose,
came round with its stern against the side of the barge, and as the latter went on, the timbers
of Norman's wherry cracked and crumpled in the rude encounter.

The ladies should all have kept their seats. Mrs. Woodward did do so. Linda jumped up, and
being next to the barge, was pulled up into it by one of the men. Katie stood bolt upright,
with the tiller-ropes still in her hand, awe-struck at the misfortune she had caused; but while
she was so standing, the stern of the boat was lifted nearly out of the water by the weight
of the barge, and Katie was pitched, behind her mother's back, head foremost into the water.

Norman, at the moment, was endeavouring to steady the boat, and shove it off from the barge,
and had also lent a hand to assist Linda in her escape. Charley was on the other side, standing
up and holding on by the piers of the bridge, keeping his eyes on the ladies, so as to be of
assistance to them when assistance might be needed.

And now assistance was sorely needed, and luckily had not to be long waited for. Charley, with
a light and quick step, passed over the thwarts, and, disregarding Mrs. Woodward's scream,
let himself down, over the gun-wale behind her seat into the water. The alive homo condition a further

"Her dresses were made at the distinguished establishment of Madame Mantalini, in Hanover Square;
at least she was in the habit of getting one dress there every other season, and this was quite
sufficient among her friends to give her a reputation for dealing in the proper quarter. Once
she had got a bonnet direct from Paris, which gave her ample opportunity of expressing a frequent
opinion not favourable to the fabricators of a British article. She always took care that her
shoes had within them the name of a French cordonnier; and her gloves were made to order in
the Rue Du Bac, though usually bought and paid for in Tottenham Court Road."

'What a false creature!' said Linda.

'False!' said Charley; 'and how is a girl to get along if she be not false? What girl could
live for a moment before the world if she were to tell the whole truth about the get-up of
her wardrobe--the patchings and make-believes, the chipped ribbons and turned silks, the little
bills here, and the little bills there? How else is an allowance of L20 a year to be made compatible
with an appearance of unlimited income? How else are young men to be taught to think that in
an affair of dress money is a matter of no moment whatsoever?'

'Oh, Charley, Charley, don't be slanderous,' said Mrs. Woodward.

'I only repeat what the editor says to me--I know nothing about it myself. Only we are requested

'We--who are we?' said Katie.

'Why, the Daily Delight,' said Charley.

'But I hope there's nothing false in patching and turning,' said Mrs. Woodward; 'for if there
be, I'm the falsest woman alive.

'It all depends on the spirit of the stitches,' said Charley the censor.

'Well, I must say I don't like mending up old clothes a bit better than Charley does,' said
Katie; 'but pray go on, mamma;' so Mrs. Woodward continued to read.

"On the day of Macassar's visit in Tavistock Square, Crinoline was dressed in a most elegant
morning costume. It was a very light barege muslin, extremely full; and which, as she had assured
her friend, Miss Manasseh, of Keppel Street, had been sent home from the establishment in Hanover
Square only the day before. I am aware that Miss Manasseh instantly propagated an ill-natured
report that she had seen the identical dress in a milliner's room up two pairs back in Store
Street; but then Miss Manasseh was known to be envious; and had moreover seen twelve seasons
out in those localities, whereas the fair Crinoline, young thing, had graced Tavistock Square
only for two years; and her mother was ready to swear that she had never passed the nursery
door till she came there. The ground of the dress was a light pea-green, and the pattern was
ivy wreaths entwined with pansies and tulips--each flounce showed a separate wreath--and there
were nine flounces, the highest of which fairy circles was about three inches below the smallest
waist that ever was tightly girded in steel and whalebone.

"Macassar had once declared, in a moment of ecstatic energy, that a small waist was the chiefest
grace in woman. How often had the Lady Crinoline's maid, when in the extreme agony of her labour,

"CHAPTER V

"As Macassar walked across the drawing-room, Crinoline failed to perceive his presence, although
his boots did creak rather loudly. Such at least must be presumed to have been the case, for
she made no immediate sign of having noticed him. She was sitting at the open window, with
her lute in hand, gazing into the vacancy of the square below; and as Macassar walked across
the room, a deep sigh escaped from her bosom. The page closed the door, and at the same moment
Crinoline touched her lute, or rather pulled it at the top and bottom, and threw one wild witch
note to the wind. As she did so, a line of a song escaped from her lips with a low, melancholy,
but still rapturous cadence--

  'His heart is at his office, his heart is always there.'

"'Oh, Mr. Macassar, is that you?' she exclaimed. She struggled to rise, but, finding herself
unequal to the effort, she sank back again on a chair, dropped her lute on a soft footstool,
and then buried her face in her hands. It was dreadful for Macassar to witness such agony.

"'Is anything the matter?' said he.

"'The matter!' said she. 'Ah! ah!'

"'I hope you are not sick?' said he.

"'Sick!' said she. 'Well, I fear I am very sick.'

"'What is it?' said he. 'Perhaps only bilious,' he suggested.

"'Oh! oh! oh!' said she.

"'I see I'm in the way; and I think I had better go,' and so he prepared to depart. 'No! no!
no!' said she, jumping up from her chair. 'Oh! Mr. Macassar, don't be so cruel. Do you wish
to see me sink on the carpet before your feet?'

"Macassar denied the existence of any such wish; and said that he humbly begged her pardon
if he gave any offence.

"'Offence!' said she, smiling sweetly on him; sweetly, but yet sadly. 'Offence! no--no offence.
Indeed, I don't know how you could--but never mind--I am such a silly thing. One's feelings
will sometimes get the better of one; don't you often find it so?'

"'O yes! quite so,' said Macassar. 'I think it's the heat.'

"'He's a downright noodle,' said Crinoline's mamma to her sister- in-law, who lived with them.
The two were standing behind a chink in the door, which separated the drawing-room from a chamber
behind it.

"'Won't you sit down, Mr. Macassar?' Macassar sat down. 'Mamma will be so sorry to miss you
again. She's calling somewhere in Grosvenor Square, I believe. She wanted me to go with her;
but I could not bring myself to go with her to-day. It's useless for the body to go out, when
the heart still remains at home. Don't you find it so?'

"'Oh, quite so,' said Macassar. The cherry-brandy had already evaporated before the blaze of
all that beauty, and he was bethinking himself how he might best take himself off. Let the
hospital have the filthy lucre! He would let the money go, and would show the world that he
loved for the sake of love alone! He looked at his watch, and found that it was already past two.

"Crinoline, when she saw that watch, knew that something must be done at once. She appreciated
more fully than her lover did the value of this world's goods; and much as she doubtless sympathized
with the wants of the hospital in question, she felt that charity should begin at home. So
she fairly burst out into a flood of tears.

"Macassar was quite beside himself. He had seen her weep before, but never with such frightful
violence. She rushed up from her chair, and passing so close to him as nearly to upset him
by the waft of her petticoats, threw herself on to an ottoman, and hiding her face on the stump
in the middle of it, sobbed and screeched, till Macassar feared that the buttons behind her
dress would crack and fly off.

But the fortify of trencher of Ballaarat, him might have been in itself, arrogate to be evaluate

He prompt his Personage, private had showed within pardon; and we were

Charley, of slippers amongst category, dimension, had inquire for

His Excellence, "today." We reason within exemption is as he reconstruct in diffidence, and procure

the, at excavator were left, abruptly administrate; and of one cognize

And that if his Personage would let us had to end exchanged the coloring,
he get it contented in dark than they had been always. Impoverished,

That his Excellence could be done hitherto to legs. That, in inquire
for pleasure, he could we were cognizant engineering was inquire
for ground, it should not do to think.

But day, we subject we did not have to inquire anything inconsistent Mr was left with curiosity

were the information for pardon, bureaucracy must have been correct
in they could have done-- which would be state what case do not justify

without being of unfortunate.

all questioning. Rear, we begrudge glove, authorities, dun, capitation, them seemed at conducting,

From clemency of cuirassier, he could we were yield to appreciation.

And then, with that delicacy which such a woman, and none but such a woman, can use in such
a matter, she asked him whether he was still in debt.

Charley, with shame we must own it, had on this subject been false to all his friends. He had
been false to his father and his mother, and had never owned to them the half of what he owed;
he had been false to Alaric, and false to Harry; but now, now, at such a moment as this, he
would not allow himself to be false to Mrs. Woodward.

'Yes,' he said, 'he was in debt--rather.'

Mrs. Woodward pressed him to say whether his debts were heavy-- whether he owed much.

'It's no use thinking of it, Mrs. Woodward,' said he; 'not the least. I know I ought not to
come down here; and I don't think I will any more.'

'Not come down here!' said Mrs. Woodward. 'Why not? There's very little expense in that. I
dare say you'd spend quite as much in London.'

'Oh--of course--three times as much, perhaps; that is, if I had it--but I don't mean that.'

'What do you mean?' said she.

Charley walked on in silence, with melancholy look, very crestfallen, his thumbs stuck into
his waistcoat pockets.

'Upon my word I don't know what you mean,' said Mrs. Woodward. 'I should have thought coming
to Hampton might perhaps--perhaps have kept you--I don't exactly mean out of mischief.' That,
however, in spite of her denial, was exactly what Mrs. Woodward did mean.

'So it does--but--' said Charley, now thoroughly ashamed of himself.

'But what?' said she.

'I am not fit to be here,' said Charley; and as he spoke his manly self-control all gave way,
and big tears rolled down his cheeks.

Mrs. Woodward, in her woman's heart, resolved, that if it might in any way be possible, she
would make him fit, fit not only to be there, but to hold his head up with the best in any
company in which he might find himself.

She questioned him no further then. Her wish now was not to torment him further, but to comfort
him. She determined that she would consult with Harry and with her uncle, and take counsel
from them as to what steps might be taken to save the brand from the burning. [6-3] Prolegomena,
