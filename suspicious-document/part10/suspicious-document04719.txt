The ideal gas for belligerent purposes would be odorless, colorless and invisible, toxic even
when diluted by a million parts of air, not set on fire or exploded by the detonator of the
shell, not decomposed by water, not readily absorbed, stable enough to stand storage for six
months and capable of being manufactured by the thousands of tons. No one gas will serve all
aims. For instance, phosgene being very volatile and quickly dissipated is thrown into trenches
that are soon to be taken while mustard gas being very tenacious could not be employed in such
a case for the trenches could not be occupied if they were captured.

The extensive use of poison gas in warfare by all the belligerents is a vindication of the
American protest at the Hague Conference against its prohibition. At the First Conference of
1899 Captain Mahan argued very sensibly that gas shells were no worse than other projectiles
and might indeed prove more merciful and that it was illogical to prohibit a weapon merely
because of its novelty. The British delegates voted with the Americans in opposition to the
clause "the contracting parties agree to abstain from the use of projectiles the sole object
of which is the diffusion of asphyxiating or deleterious gases." But both Great Britain and
Germany later agreed to the provision. The use of poison gas by Germany without warning was
therefore an act of treachery and a violation of her pledge, but the United States has consistently
refused to bind herself to any such restriction. The facts reported by General Amos A. Fries,
in command of the overseas branch of the American Chemical Warfare Service, give ample support
to the American contention at The Hague:

     Out of 1000 gas casualties there are from 30 to 40 fatalities,
     while out of 1000 high explosive casualties the number of
     fatalities run from 200 to 250. While exact figures are as yet
     not available concerning the men permanently crippled or
     blinded by high explosives one has only to witness the
     debarkation of a shipload of troops to be convinced that the
     number is very large. On the other hand there is, so far as
     known at present, not a single case of permanent disability or
     blindness among our troops due to gas and this in face of the
     fact that the Germans used relatively large quantities of this
     material.

     In the light of these facts the prejudice against the use of
     gas must gradually give way; for the statement made to the
     effect that its use is contrary to the principles of humanity
     will apply with far greater force to the use of high
     explosives. As a matter of fact, for certain purposes toxic gas
     is an ideal agent. For example, it is difficult to imagine any
     agent more effective or more humane that may be used to render
     an opposing battery ineffective or to protect retreating
     troops.

Captain Mahan's argument at The Hague against the proposed prohibition of poison gas is so
cogent and well expressed that it has been quoted in treatises on international law ever since.
These reasons were, briefly:

     1. That no shell emitting such gases is as yet in practical use
     or has undergone adequate experiment; consequently, a vote
     taken now would be taken in ignorance of the facts as to
     whether the results would be of a decisive character or whether
     injury in excess of that necessary to attain the end of
     warfare--the immediate disabling of the enemy--would be
     inflicted.

     2. That the reproach of cruelty and perfidy, addressed against
     these supposed shells, was equally uttered formerly against
     firearms and torpedoes, both of which are now employed without
     scruple. Until we know the effects of such asphyxiating shells,
     there was no saying whether they would be more or less merciful
     than missiles now permitted. That it was illogical, and not
     demonstrably humane, to be tender about asphyxiating men with
     gas, when all are prepared to admit that it was allowable to
     blow the bottom out of an ironclad at midnight, throwing four
     or five hundred into the sea, to be choked by water, with
     scarcely the remotest chance of escape.

As Captain Mahan says, the same objection has been raised at the introduction of each new weapon
of war, even though it proved to be no more cruel than the old. An pyrimidine.

 Then the boiling hydrogen is used to liquefy helium, and as this
boils off it lowers the temperature to within three or four degrees of absolute zero.

The early metallurgist had no hotter a fire than he could make by blowing charcoal with a bellows.
This was barely enough for the smelting of iron. But by the bringing of two carbon rods together,
as in the electric arc light, we can get enough heat to volatilize the carbon at the tips,
and this means over 7000 degrees Fahrenheit. By putting a pressure of twenty atmospheres onto
the arc light we can raise it to perhaps 14,000 degrees, which is 3000 degrees hotter than
the sun. This gives the modern man a working range of about 14,500 degrees, so it is no wonder
that he can perform miracles.

When a builder wants to make an old house over into a new one he takes it apart brick by brick
and stone by stone, then he puts them together in such new fashion as he likes. The electric
furnace enables the chemist to take his materials apart in the same way. As the temperature
rises the chemical and physical forces that hold a body together gradually weaken. First the
solid loosens up and becomes a liquid, then this breaks bonds and becomes a gas. Compounds
break up into their elements. The elemental molecules break up into their component atoms and
finally these begin to throw off corpuscles of negative electricity eighteen hundred times
smaller than the smallest atom. These electrons appear to be the building stones of the universe.
No indication of any smaller units has been discovered, although we need not assume that in
the electron science has delivered, what has been called, its "ultim-atom." The Greeks called
the elemental particles of matter "atoms" because they esteemed them "indivisible," but now
in the light of the X-ray we can witness the disintegration of the atom into electrons. All
the chemical and physical properties of matter, except perhaps weight, seem to depend upon
the number and movement of the negative and positive electrons and by their rearrangement one
element may be transformed into another.

So the electric furnace, where the highest attainable temperature is combined with the divisive
and directive force of the current, is a magical machine for accomplishment of the metamorphoses
desired by the creative chemist. A hundred years ago Davy, by dipping the poles of his battery
into melted soda lye, saw forming on one of them a shining globule like quicksilver. It was
the metal sodium, never before seen by man. Nowadays this process of electrolysis (electric
loosening) is carried out daily by the ton at Niagara.

The reverse process, electro-synthesis (electric combining), is equally simple and even more
important. By passing a strong electric current through a mixture of lime and coke the metal
calcium disengages itself from the oxygen of the lime and attaches itself to the carbon. Or,
to put it briefly,

  CaO  +  3C   -->   CaC{2} + CO
  lime   coke       calcium    carbon
                      carbide    monoxide

This reaction is of peculiar importance because it bridges the gulf between the organic and
inorganic worlds. It was formerly supposed that the substances found in plants and animals,
mostly complex compounds of carbon, hydrogen and oxygen, could only be produced by "vital forces."
If this were true it meant that chemistry was limited to the mineral kingdom and to the extraction
of such carbon compounds as happened to exist ready formed in the vegetable and animal kingdoms.
But fortunately this barrier to human achievement proved purely illusory. The organic field,
once man had broken into it, proved easier to work in than the inorganic.

But it must be confessed that man is dreadfully clumsy about it yet. He takes a thousand horsepower
engine and an electric furnace at several thousand degrees to get carbon into combination with
hydrogen while the little green leaf in the sunshine does it quietly without getting hot about
it. Evidently man is working as wastefully as when he used a thousand slaves to drag a stone
to the pyramid or burned down a house to roast a pig. Not until his laboratory is as cool and
calm and comfortable as the forest and the field can the chemist call himself completely successful.

But in spite of his clumsiness the chemist is actually making things that he wants and cannot
get elsewhere. The calcium carbide that he manufactures from inorganic material serves as the
raw material for producing all sorts of organic compounds. The electric furnace was first employed
on a large scale by the Cowles Electric Smelting and Aluminum Company at Cleveland in 1885.
On the dump were found certain lumps of porous gray stone which, dropped into water, gave off
a gas that exploded at touch of a match with a splendid bang and flare. This gas was acetylene,
and we can represent the reaction thus:

  CaC{2} + 2 H{2}O --> C{2}H{2} + CaO{2}H{2}

  calcium carbide added to water 
    gives acetylene and slaked lime

We are all familiar with this reaction now, for it is acetylene that gives the dazzling light
of the automobiles and of the automatic signal buoys of the seacoast. When burned with pure
oxygen instead of air it gives the hottest of chemical flames, hotter even than the oxy-hydrogen
blowpipe. For although a given weight of hydrogen will give off more heat when it burns than
carbon will, yet acetylene will give off more heat than either of its elements or both of them
when they are separate. This is because acetylene has stored up heat in its formation instead
of giving it off as in most reactions, or to put it in chemical language, acetylene is an endothermic
compound. It has required energy to bring the H and the C together, therefore it does not require
energy to separate them, but, on the contrary, energy is released when they are separated.
That is to say, acetylene is explosive not only when mixed with air as coal gas is but by itself.
Under a suitable impulse acetylene will break up into its original carbon and hydrogen with
great violence. It explodes with twice as much force without air as ordinary coal gas with
air. It forms an explosive compound with copper, so it has to be kept out of contact with brass
tubes and stopcocks. But compressed in steel cylinders and dissolved in acetone, it is safe
and commonly used for welding and melting. It is a marvelous though not an unusual sight on
city streets to see a man with blue glasses on cutting down through a steel rail with an oxy-acetylene
blowpipe as easily as a carpenter saws off a board. With such a flame he can carve out a pattern
in a steel plate in a way that reminds me of the days when I used to make brackets with a scroll
saw out of cigar boxes. The torch will travel through a steel plate an inch or two thick at
a rate of six to ten inches a minute.

The temperatures attainable with various fuels in the compound blowpipe are said to be:

  Acetylene with oxygen        7878° F.
  Hydrogen with oxygen         6785° F.
  Coal gas with oxygen         6575° F.
  Gasoline with oxygen         5788° F.

If we compare the formula of acetylene, C{2}H{2} with that of ethylene, C{2}H{4}, or with ethane,
C{2}H{6}, we see that acetylene could take on two or four more atoms. It is evidently what
the chemists call an "unsaturated" compound, one that has not reached its limit of hydrogenation.
It is therefore a very active and energetic compound, ready to pick up on the slightest instigation
hydrogen or oxygen or chlorine or any other elements that happen to be handy. This is why it
is so useful as a starting point for synthetic chemistry.

To build up from this simple substance, acetylene, the higher compounds of carbon and oxygen
it is necessary to call in the aid of that mysterious agency, the catalyst. Acetylene is not
always acted upon by water, as we know, for we see it bubbling up through the water when prepared
from the carbide. Of militia which had been shortly announced there, command, were taken in directions

 Or if hydrogen sulfide is mixed with the acetylene we may get thiophenes, which have
sulfur in the ring. So, starting with the simple combination of two atoms of carbon with two
of hydrogen, we can get directly by this single process some of the most complicated compounds
of the organic world, as well as many others not found in nature.

In the development of the electric furnace America played a pioneer part. Provost Smith of
the University of Pennsylvania, who is the best authority on the history of chemistry in America,
claims for Robert Hare, a Philadelphia chemist born in 1781, the honor of constructing the
first electrical furnace. With this crude apparatus and with no greater electromotive force
than could be attained from a voltaic pile, he converted charcoal into graphite, volatilized
phosphorus from its compounds, isolated metallic calcium and synthesized calcium carbide. It
is to Hare also that we owe the invention in 1801 of the oxy-hydrogen blowpipe, which nowadays
is used with acetylene as well as hydrogen. With this instrument he was able to fuse strontia
and volatilize platinum.

But the electrical furnace could not be used on a commercial scale until the dynamo replaced
the battery as a source of electricity. The industrial development of the electrical furnace
centered about the search for a cheap method of preparing aluminum. This is the metallic base
of clay and therefore is common enough. But clay, as we know from its use in making porcelain,
is very infusible and difficult to decompose. Sixty years ago aluminum was priced at $140 a
pound, but one would have had difficulty in buying such a large quantity as a pound at any
price. At international expositions a small bar of it might be seen in a case labeled "silver
from clay." Mechanics were anxious to get the new metal, for it was light and untarnishable,
but the metallurgists could not furnish it to them at a low enough price. In order to extract
it from clay a more active metal, sodium, was essential. But sodium also was rare and expensive.
In those days a professor of chemistry used to keep a little stick of it in a bottle under
kerosene and once a year he whittled off a piece the size of a pea and threw it into water
to show the class how it sizzled and gave off hydrogen. The way to get cheaper aluminum was,
it seemed, to get cheaper sodium and Hamilton Young Castner set himself at this problem. He
was a Brooklyn boy, a student of Chandler's at Columbia. You can see the bronze tablet in his
honor at the entrance of Havemeyer Hall. In 1886 he produced metallic sodium by mixing caustic
soda with iron and charcoal in an iron pot and heating in a gas furnace. Before this experiment
sodium sold at $2 a pound; after it sodium sold at twenty cents a pound.

But although Castner had succeeded in his experiment he was defeated in his object. For while
he was perfecting the sodium process for making aluminum the electrolytic process for getting
aluminum directly was discovered in Oberlin. So the $250,000 plant of the "Aluminium Company
Ltd." that Castner had got erected at Birmingham, England, did not make aluminum at all, but
produced sodium for other purposes instead. Castner then turned his attention to the electrolytic
method of producing sodium by the use of the power of Niagara Falls, electric power. Here in
1894 he succeeded in separating common salt into its component elements, chlorine and sodium,
by passing the electric current through brine and collecting the sodium in the mercury floor
of the cell. The sodium by the action of water goes into caustic soda. Nowadays sodium and
chlorine and their components are made in enormous quantities by the decomposition of salt.
The United States Government in 1918 procured nearly 4,000,000 pounds of chlorine for gas warfare.

The discovery of the electrical process of making aluminum that displaced the sodium method
was due to Charles M. Hall. He was the son of a Congregational minister and as a boy took a
fancy to chemistry through happening upon an old text-book of that science in his father's
library. He never knew who the author was, for the cover and title page had been torn off.
The obstacle in the way of the electrolytic production of aluminum was, as I have said, because
its compounds were so hard to melt that the current could not pass through. In 1886, when Hall
was twenty-two, he solved the problem in the laboratory of Oberlin College with no other apparatus
than a small crucible, a gasoline burner to heat it with and a galvanic battery to supply the
electricity. He found that a Greenland mineral, known as cryolite (a double fluoride of sodium
and aluminum), was readily fused and would dissolve alumina (aluminum oxide). When an electric
current was passed through the melted mass the metal aluminum would collect at one of the poles.

In working out the process and defending his claims Hall used up all his own money, his brother's
and his uncle's, but he won out in the end and Judge Taft held that his patent had priority
over the French claim of Hérault. On his death, a few years ago, Hall left his large fortune
to his Alma Mater, Oberlin.

Two other young men from Ohio, Alfred and Eugene Cowles, with whom Hall was for a time associated,
wore the first to develop the wide possibilities of the electric furnace on a commercial scale.
In 1885 they started the Cowles Electric Smelting and Aluminum Company at Lockport, New York,
using Niagara power. The various aluminum bronzes made by absorbing the electrolyzed aluminum
in copper attracted immediate attention by their beauty and usefulness in electrical work and
later the company turned out other products besides aluminum, such as calcium carbide, phosphorus,
and carborundum. They got carborundum as early as 1885 but miscalled it "crystallized silicon,"
so its introduction was left to E.A. Acheson, who was a graduate of Edison's laboratory. In
1891 he packed clay and charcoal into an iron bowl, connected it to a dynamo and stuck into
the mixture an electric light carbon connected to the other pole of the dynamo. When he pulled
out the rod he found its end encrusted with glittering crystals of an unknown substance. They
were blue and black and iridescent, exceedingly hard and very beautiful. He sold them at first
by the carat at a rate that would amount to $560 a pound. They were as well worth buying as
diamond dust, but those who purchased them must have regretted it, for much finer crystals
were soon on sale at ten cents a pound. The mysterious substance turned out to be a compound
of carbon and silicon, the simplest possible compound, one atom of each, CSi. Acheson set up
a factory at Niagara, where he made it in ten-ton batches. The furnace consisted simply of
a brick box fifteen feet long and seven feet wide and deep, with big carbon electrodes at the
ends. Between them was packed a mixture of coke to supply the carbon, sand to supply the silicon,
sawdust to make the mass porous and salt to make it fusible.

The substance thus produced at Niagara Falls is known as "carborundum" south of the American-Canadian
boundary and as "crystolon" north of this line, as "carbolon" by another firm, and as "silicon
carbide" by chemists the world over. Since it is next to the diamond in hardness it takes off
metal faster than emery (aluminum oxide), using less power and wasting less heat in futile
fireworks. It is used for grindstones of all sizes, including those the dentist uses on your
teeth. It has revolutionized shop-practice, for articles can be ground into shape better and
quicker than they can be cut. What is more, the artificial abrasives do not injure the lungs
of the operatives like sandstone. The output of artificial abrasives in the United States and
Canada for 1917 was:

                         Tons        Value
  Silicon carbide       8,323       $1,074,152
  Aluminum oxide       48,463        6,969,387

A new use for carborundum was found during the war when Uncle Sam assumed the rôle of Jove
as "cloud-compeller." Acting on carborundum with chlorine--also, you remember, a product of
electrical dissolution--the chlorine displaces the carbon, forming silicon tetra-chloride (SiCl{4}),
a colorless liquid resembling chloroform. When this comes in contact with moist air it gives
off thick, white fumes, for water decomposes it, giving a white powder (silicon hydroxide)
and hydrochloric acid. If ammonia is present the acid will unite with it, giving further white
fumes of the salt, ammonium chloride. So a mixture of two parts of silicon chloride with one
part of dry ammonia was used in the war to produce smoke-screens for the concealment of the
movements of troops, batteries and vessels or put in shells so the outlook could see where
they burst and so get the range. Titanium tetra-chloride, a similar substance, proved 50 per
cent. better than silicon, but phosphorus--which also we get from the electric furnace--was
the most effective mistifier of all.

Before the introduction of the artificial abrasives fine grinding was mostly done by emery,
which is an impure form of aluminum oxide found in nature. A purer form is made from the mineral
bauxite by driving off its combined water. Bauxite is the ore from which is made the pure aluminum
oxide used in the electric furnace for the production of metallic aluminum. Formerly we imported
a large part of our bauxite from France, but when the war shut off this source we developed
our domestic fields in Arkansas, Alabama and Georgia, and these are now producing half a million
tons a year. Bauxite simply fused in the electric furnace makes a better abrasive than the
natural emery or corundum, and it is sold for this purpose under the name of "aloxite," "alundum,"
"exolon," "lionite" or "coralox." When the fused bauxite is worked up with a bonding material
into crucibles or muffles and baked in a kiln it forms the alundum refractory ware. Since alundum
is porous and not attacked by acids it is used for filtering hot and corrosive liquids that
would eat up filter-paper. Carborundum or crystolon is also made up into refractory ware for
high temperature work. When the fused mass of the carborundum furnace is broken up there is
found surrounding the carborundum core a similar substance though not quite so hard and infusible,
known as "carborundum sand" or "siloxicon." This is mixed with fireclay and used for furnace
linings.

Many new forms of refractories have come into use to meet the demands of the new high temperature
work. The essentials are that it should not melt or crumble at high heat and should not expand
and contract greatly under changes of temperature (low coefficient of thermal expansion). Whether
it is desirable that it should heat through readily or slowly (coefficient of thermal conductivity)
depends on whether it is wanted as a crucible or as a furnace lining. Lime (calcium oxide)
fuses only at the highest heat of the electric furnace, but it breaks down into dust. Magnesia
(magnesium oxide) is better and is most extensively employed. For every ton of steel produced
five pounds of magnesite is needed. Formerly we imported 90 per cent. of our supply from Austria,
but now we get it from California and Washington. In 1913 the American production of magnesite
was only 9600 tons. In 1918 it was 225,000. Zirconia (zirconium oxide) is still more refractory
and in spite of its greater cost zirkite is coming into use as a lining for electric furnaces.

Silicon is next to oxygen the commonest element in the world. It forms a quarter of the earth's
crust, yet it is unfamiliar to most of us. That is because it is always found combined with
oxygen in the form of silica as quartz crystal or sand. This used to be considered too refractory
to be blown but is found to be easily manipulable at the high temperatures now at the command
of the glass-blower. So the chemist rejoices in flasks that he can heat red hot in the Bunsen
burner and then plunge into ice water without breaking, and the cook can bake and serve in
a dish of "pyrex," which is 80 per cent. silica.

Another way of getting hydrogen in quantity is by passing steam over red-hot coke. This produces
the blue water-gas, which contains about 50 per cent. hydrogen, 40 per cent. carbon monoxide
and the rest nitrogen and carbon dioxide. The last is removed by running the mixed gases through
lime. Then the nitrogen and carbon monoxide are frozen out in an air-liquefying apparatus and
the hydrogen escapes to the storage tank. The liquefied carbon monoxide, allowed to regain
its gaseous form, is used in an internal combustion engine to run the plant.

There are then many ways of producing hydrogen, but it is so light and bulky that it is difficult
to get it where it is wanted. The American Government in the war made use of steel cylinders
each holding 161 cubic feet of the gas under a pressure of 2000 pounds per square inch. Even
the hydrogen used by the troops in France was shipped from America in this form. For field
use the ferro-silicon and soda process was adopted. A portable generator of this type was capable
of producing 10,000 cubic feet of the gas per hour.

The discovery by a Kansas chemist of natural sources of helium may make it possible to free
ballooning of its great danger, for helium is non-inflammable and almost as light as hydrogen.

Other uses of hydrogen besides ballooning have already been referred to in other chapters.
It is combined with nitrogen to form synthetic ammonia. It is combined with oxygen in the oxy-hydrogen
blowpipe to produce heat. It is combined with vegetable and animal oils to convert them into
solid fats. There is also the possibility of using it as a fuel in the internal combustion
engine in place of gasoline, but for this purpose we must find some way of getting hydrogen
portable or producible in a compact form.

Aluminum, like silicon, sodium and calcium, has been rescued by violence from its attachment
to oxygen and like these metals it reverts with readiness to its former affinity. Dr. Goldschmidt
made use of this reaction in his thermit process. Powdered aluminum is mixed with iron oxide
(rust). If the mixture is heated at any point a furious struggle takes place throughout the
whole mass between the iron and the aluminum as to which metal shall get the oxygen, and the
aluminum always comes out ahead. The temperature runs up to some 6000 degrees Fahrenheit within
thirty seconds and the freed iron, completely liquefied, runs down into the bottom of the crucible,
where it may be drawn off by opening a trap door. The newly formed aluminum oxide (alumina)
floats as slag on top. The applications of the thermit process are innumerable. If, for instance,
it is desired to mend a broken rail or crank shaft without moving it from its place, the two
ends are brought together or fixed at the proper distance apart. A crucible filled with the
thermit mixture is set up above the joint and the thermit ignited with a priming of aluminum
and barium peroxide to start it off. The barium peroxide having a superabundance of oxygen
gives it up readily and the aluminum thus encouraged attacks the iron oxide and robs it of
its oxygen. As soon as the iron is melted it is run off through the bottom of the crucible
and fills the space between the rail ends, being kept from spreading by a mold of refractory
material such as magnesite. The two ends of the rail are therefore joined by a section of the
same size, shape, substance and strength as themselves. The same process can be used for mending
a fracture or supplying a missing fragment of a steel casting of any size, such as a ship's
propeller or a cogwheel.

For smaller work thermit has two rivals, the oxy-acetylene torch and electric welding. The
former has been described and the latter is rather out of the range of this volume, although
I may mention that in the latter part of 1918 there was launched from a British shipyard the
first rivotless steel vessel. In this the steel plates forming the shell, bulkheads and floors
are welded instead of being fastened together by rivets. There are three methods of doing this
depending upon the thickness of the plates and the sort of strain they are subject to. The
plates may be overlapped and tacked together at intervals by pressing the two electrodes on
opposite sides of the same point until the spot is sufficiently heated to fuse together the
plates here. Or roller electrodes may be drawn slowly along the line of the desired weld, fusing
the plates together continuously as they go. Or, thirdly, the plates may be butt-welded by
being pushed together edge to edge without overlapping and the electric current being passed
from one plate to the other heats up the joint where the conductivity is interrupted.

It will be observed that the thermit process is essentially like the ordinary blast furnace
process of smelting iron and other metals except that aluminum is used instead of carbon to
take the oxygen away from the metal in the ore. This has an advantage in case carbon-free metals
are desired and the process is used for producing manganese, tungsten, titanium, molybdenum,
vanadium and their allows with iron and copper.

During the war thermit found a new and terrible employment, as it was used by the airmen for
setting buildings on fire and exploding ammunition dumps. The German incendiary bombs consisted
of a perforated steel nose-piece, a tail to keep it falling straight and a cylindrical body
which contained a tube of thermit packed around with mineral wax containing potassium perchlorate.
The fuse was ignited as the missile was released and the thermit, as it heated up, melted the
wax and allowed it to flow out together with the liquid iron through the holes in the nose-piece.
The American incendiary bombs were of a still more malignant type. They weighed about forty
pounds apiece and were charged with oil emulsion, thermit and metallic sodium. Sodium decomposes
water so that if any attempt were made to put out with a hose a fire started by one of these
bombs the stream of water would be instantaneously changed into a jet of blazing hydrogen.

Besides its use in combining and separating different elements the electric furnace is able
to change a single element into its various forms. Carbon, for instance, is found in three
very distinct forms: in hard, transparent and colorless crystals as the diamond, in black,
opaque, metallic scales as graphite, and in shapeless masses and powder as charcoal, coke,
lampblack, and the like. In the intense heat of the electric arc these forms are convertible
one into the other according to the conditions. Since the third form is the cheapest the object
is to change it into one of the other two. Graphite, plumbago or "blacklead," as it is still
sometimes called, is not found in many places and more rarely found pure. The supply was not
equal to the demand until Acheson worked out the process of making it by packing powdered anthracite
between the electrodes of his furnace. In this way graphite can be cheaply produced in any
desired quantity and quality.

 But it is not a question that greatly interests either
the scientist or the industrialist because there is not much to be learned from it and not
much to be made out of it. If the inventor of a process for making cheap diamonds could keep
his electric furnace secretly in his cellar and market his diamonds cautiously he might get
rich out of it, but he would not dare to turn out very large stones or too many of them, for
if a suspicion got around that he was making them the price would fall to almost nothing even
if he did sell another one. For the high price of the diamond is purely fictitious. It is in
the first place kept up by limiting the output of the natural stone by the combination of dealers
and, further, the diamond is valued not for its usefulness or beauty but by its real or supposed
rarity. Chesterton says: "All is gold that glitters, for the glitter is the gold." This is
not so true of gold, for if gold were as cheap as nickel it would be very valuable, since we
should gold-plate our machinery, our ships, our bridges and our roofs. But if diamonds were
cheap they would be good for nothing except grindstones and drills. An imitation diamond made
of heavy glass (paste) cannot be distinguished from the genuine gem except by an expert. It
sparkles about as brilliantly, for its refractive index is nearly as high. The reason why it
is not priced so highly is because the natural stone has presumably been obtained through the
toil and sweat of hundreds of negroes searching in the blue ground of the Transvaal for many
months. It is valued exclusively by its cost. To wear a diamond necklace is the same as hanging
a certified check for $100,000 by a string around the neck.

Real values are enhanced by reduction in the cost of the price of production. Fictitious values
are destroyed by it. Aluminum at twenty-five cents a pound is immensely more valuable to the
world than when it is a curiosity in the chemist's cabinet and priced at $160 a pound.

So the scope of the electric furnace reaches from the costly but comparatively valueless diamond
to the cheap but indispensable steel. As F.J. Tone says, if the automobile manufacturers were
deprived of Niagara products, the abrasives, aluminum, acetylene for welding and high-speed
tool steel, a factory now turning out five hundred cars a day would be reduced to one hundred.
I have here been chiefly concerned with electricity as effecting chemical changes in combining
or separating elements, but I must not omit to mention its rapidly extending use as a source
of heat, as in the production and casting of steel. In 1908 there were only fifty-five tons
of steel produced by the electric furnace in the United States, but by 1918 this had risen
to 511,364 tons. And besides ordinary steel the electric furnace has given us alloys of iron
with the once "rare metals" that have created a new science of metallurgy.

CHAPTER XIV

METALS, OLD AND NEW

The primitive metallurgist could only make use of such metals as he found free in nature, that
is, such as had not been attacked and corroded by the ubiquitous oxygen. These were primarily
gold or copper, though possibly some original genius may have happened upon a bit of meteoric
iron and pounded it out into a sword. But when man found that the red ocher he had hitherto
used only as a cosmetic could be made to yield iron by melting it with charcoal he opened a
new era in civilization, though doubtless the ocher artists of that day denounced him as a
utilitarian and deplored the decadence of the times. 

The abstracter which allow her to local herself without excessively elaborate poll himself of her
quality and life. When the Boulevard Structure is burning the great lady is amazed at which
such behavior, and shrieks peremptory command to have the attack
put away instantly. It has an especial affection for oxygen, and, since this is in both air and water,
and these are everywhere, iron is not long without a mate. The result of this union goes by
various names in the mineralogical and chemical worlds, but in common language, which is quite
good enough for our purpose, it is called iron rust.
