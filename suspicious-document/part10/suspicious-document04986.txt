PREFACE.

A few words of preface may save footnotes to a story which deals with the half-forgotten days
when the power of a British prince had yet to be reckoned with by the Wessex kings as they
slowly and steadily pushed their frontier westward.

The authority for the historical basis of the story is the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, which gives
A.D. 710 as the year of the defeat of Gerent, king of the West Welsh, by Ina of Wessex and
his kinsman Nunna. This date is therefore approximately that of the events of the tale.

With regard to the topography of the Wessex frontier involved, although it practically explains
itself in the course of the story, it may be as well to remind a reader that West Wales was
the last British kingdom south of the Severn Sea, the name being, of course, given by Wessex
men to distinguish it from the Welsh principalities in what we now call Wales, to their north.
In the days of Ina it comprised Cornwall and the present Devon and also the half of Somerset
westward of the north and south line of the river Parrett and Quantock Hills. Practically this
old British "Dyvnaint" represented the ancient Roman province of Damnonia, shrinking as it
was under successive advances of the Saxons from the boundary which it once had along the Mendips
and Selwood Forest. Ina's victory over Gerent set the Dyvnaint frontier yet westward, to the
line of the present county of Somerset, which represents the limit of his conquest, the new
addition to the territory of the clan of the Sumorsaetas long being named as "Devon in Wessex"
by the chroniclers rather than as Somerset.

The terms "Devon" or "Dyvnaint," as they are respectively used by Saxon or Briton in the course
of the story, will therefore be understood to imply the ancient territory before its limitation
by the boundaries of the modern counties, which practically took their rise from the wars of Ina.
