The Pirate Slaver, a Story of the West African Coast, by Harry Collingwood.

This is a very well-written book, especially from the nautical point of view.  It is written
as by a midshipman in a British warship patrolling the west coast of Africa, especially the
Congo area, to try to prevent the slave traders, especially the Portuguese, from succeeding
in their efforts to get the poor captured Africans over the Atlantic to Cuba in the most miserable
conditions.

But it doesn't work out as simply as that!  For the hero, Harry Dugdale, is captured in an
action, and would have been killed but for the interest taken in him by the slaver-captain's
son.  From this there sprang a deal with the slaver that Harry would assist with navigation
and watch-keeping, but must go below decks when there is an action in progress.

We won't tell you much more than that but cannot refrain from commenting that the book is at
least as good as the best by Kingston, though in this book the action is almost entirely at
sea, or at least on board a sea-going vessel.

CHAPTER ONE.

THE CONGO RIVER.

"Land ho! broad on the port bow!"

The cry arose from the look-out on the forecastle of her Britannic Majesty's 18-gun brig Barracouta,
on a certain morning near the middle of the month of November, 1840; the vessel then being
situated in about latitude 6 degrees 5 minutes south and about 120 east longitude. Oct. 1, 1884,

  I am Senor Joaquin
Miguel Lobo, Portuguese trader, at your savice, sar; and I have come off to say dat I shall
be happie to supply your chip wid anyting dat you may require--vattare, fresh meat, vegetabl',
feesh, no fruit--de fruit not ripe yet; plenty fruit by an' by, but not ripe yet--parrots,
monkeys--all kind of bird and animal, yes; and curiositie--plenty curiositie, sar."

Here the skipper, who had been below for a few minutes, re-appeared on deck, and, seeing the
stranger, advanced toward him, whereupon the first lieutenant introduced Senor Joaquin Miguel
Lobo in proper form.

"Glad to see you, senor," remarked the skipper genially.  "Will you step below and take a glass
of wine with Lieutenant Young and myself?"

"Ver' happie, captain, I am sure," answered the senor with another sweeping bow and flourish
of his Panama; and forthwith the trio disappeared down the hatchway, to my unbounded astonishment,
for it was not quite like our extremely dignified skipper to be so wonderfully cordial as this
to a mere trader.

"Ah, I'm afraid that won't wash," remarked Bates, catching the look of astonishment and perplexity
on my face as I turned my regards away from the hatchway.  "The captain means to pump the Portuguese,
if he can, but from the cut of the senor's jib I fancy there is not much to be got out of him;
he looks to be far too wide-awake to let us become as wise as himself.  I'll be bound that
he could put us up to many a good wrinkle if he would; but, bless you, youngster, he's not
going to spoil his own trade.  He professes to be an honest trader, of course--deals in palm-oil
and ivory and what not, of course, and I've no doubt he does; but I wouldn't mind betting a
farthing cake that he ships a precious sight more black ivory than white out of this same river.
Look at that brig, for instance--the one flying Spanish colours, I mean.  Just look at her!
Did you ever set your eyes upon a more beautiful hull than that?  Look at the sweep of her
run; see how it comes curving round to her stern-post in a delivery so clean that it won't
leave a single eddy behind it.  No drag there, my boy!  And look at her sides: round as an
apple--not an inch of straight in them!  And do you suppose that a brig with lines like that
was built for the purpose of carrying palm-oil? Not she.  I should like to have a look at her
bows; I'll be bound they are as keen as a knife--we shall see them by and by, when she swings
at the turn of the tide.  Yet if that brig were overhauled--as she probably will be--nothing
whatever of a suspicious character would be found aboard her, except maybe a whole lot of casks,
which they would say was for stowing the palm-oil in.  Well, here we are; but we shall have
to keep our eyes open night and day to weather upon the rascally slavers; they are as sly as
foxes, and always up to some new circumventing trick."

With which reflection, followed by a deep sigh at the wily genius of the slaving fraternity
in general, the worthy master turned upon his heel and retired below.

The Portuguese remained in the cabin for over an hour; and when he came on deck again, accompanied
by the captain and the first lieutenant, I thought that the two latter looked decidedly elated,
as though, despite the master's foreboding, they had succeeded in obtaining some important
information.  The captain was particularly gracious to his visitor, going even to the length
of shaking hands with him ere he passed out through the gangway, the first luff of course following
suit, as in duty bound.

"Then we may rely upon you to send us off the fresh meat and vegetables early this afternoon?"
remarked Young, as he stood at the gangway.

"Yais, yais; dey shall be alongside by t'ree o'clock at de lates'!" answered the Portuguese.
"And as soon as you have receive dem you had better veigh and leave de creek.  Give dat point"--indicating
Boolambemba Point--"a bert' of a mile and you veel be all right."

"Yes, thanks, I will remember," returned the first lieutenant.  "And where are we to pick you up?"

"Hus-s-sh! my dear sair; not so loud, if you please," answered Lobo, hastily leaving his boat
and coming half-way up the gangway ladder again.  "Dere is a leetl' creek about two mile pas'
de point, on de nort' bank of de river.  I vill be on de look-out for you dere in a small canoe
vid two men dat I can trus'.  And you mus' pick me up queevk, because if eet vas known dat
I had consent to pilot you my t'roat would be cut before I vas a mont' oldaire."

"Never fear," answered Young.  "We will keep a sharp look-out for you and get you on board
without anybody being a penny the wiser. Good-bye."

The Portuguese bowed with another flourish of his hat, seated himself in the stern-sheets of
his boat, gave the word to his Krumen, and a few minutes later was on the wharf, walking toward
his factory, into the open door of which he disappeared.

"Come," thought I, "there is something afoot already.  The captain and the first luff have,
between them, evidently contrived to worm some intelligence out of the Portuguese.  I must
go and tell Bates the news."

Before I could do so, however, the captain, who had been standing near the gangway, listening
to what was passing between Young and Lobo, caught sight of me and said--

"Mr Dugdale, be good enough to find Mr Bates, and tell him that I shall feel obliged if he
will come to me for a few minutes in my cabin."

I touched my hat, dived down the hatchway, and gave the message, whereupon the master stepped
out of his cabin and made his way aft.  He was with the captain nearly half-an-hour; and when
he re-appeared he looked as pleased as Punch.

"I'll never attempt to judge a man's character by his face again," he exclaimed, as he caught
me by the arm, and walked me along the deck beside him.  "Who would have thought that a piratical-looking
rascal like that Portuguese would have been friendly disposed towards the representatives of
law and order?  Yet he has not only given the captain valuable information, but has actually
consented to pilot the ship to the spot which is to serve as our base of operations, although,
as he says, should the slavers get to know of his having done such a thing, they would cut
his throat without hesitation."

"Yes," said I, "I heard him make that remark to Mr Young just before shoving off.  And pray,
Mr Bates--if the question be not indiscreet-- what is the nature of the expedition upon which
we are to engage this afternoon?"

"Well, I don't know why I shouldn't tell you," answered Bates, a little doubtfully.  "Our movements
are of course to be conducted with all possible secrecy, but if I tell you I don't suppose
you'll go ashore and hire the town-crier to make public our intentions; and all hands will
have to know--more or less--what we're after, very soon, so I suppose I shall not be infringing
any of the Articles of War if I tell you now; but you needn't go and publish the news throughout
the ship, d'ye see? Let the skipper do that when he thinks fit."

"Certainly," I assented.  "You may rely implicitly upon my discretion."

"Oh yes, of course," retorted the master ironically.  "A midshipman is a perfect marvel in
the way of prudence and discretion; everybody knows that! Sir was being lift of money; us were surrounded

"You may be sure of that," answered the master, peering curiously into my face as he spoke.
"Captain Stopford is not the man to court a reverse, or a heavy loss of life, by unduly advertising
his intentions. But you look pale, boy!  You are surely not beginning to funk, are you?"

"No," said I, a little dubiously, "I think not.  But this will be my first experience of fighting,
you know--I have never been face to face with an enemy thus far--and I must confess that the
idea of a hand-to-hand fight--for I suppose it will come to that--a life-and-death struggle,
wherein one has not only to incur the awful responsibility of hurling one's fellow-creatures
into eternity, but also to take the fearful risk of being hurled thither one's self, perhaps
without a moment of time in which to breathe a prayer for mercy, is something that I, for one,
can hardly contemplate with absolute equanimity."

"Certainly not," assented Bates kindly, linking his arm in mine as he spoke; "certainly not;
you would be something more or less--less, I should be inclined to say--than human if you could.
But, as to the responsibility of hurling those villains into eternity, do not let that trouble
you for a single moment, my lad; in endeavouring to put down this inhuman slave-trade we are
engaged upon a righteous and lawful task--lawful and righteous in the eyes of God as well as
of man, I humbly believe--and if the traffickers in human flesh and human freedom and human
happiness choose to risk and lose their lives in the pursuit of their hellish trade, the responsibility
must rest with themselves, and in my humble opinion the earth is well rid of such inhuman monsters.
And as to the other matter--that of being yourself hurried into eternity unprepared--it need
not occur, my boy; no one need die unprepared.  What I mean is, of course, that all should
take especial care to be prepared for death whenever it may meet us, for we know not what a
day, or an hour, or even a moment may bring forth; the man who walks the streets of his native
town in fancied security is actually just as liable to be cut off unawares as are we who follow
the terrible but necessary profession of arms; the menaces to life ashore are as numerous as
they are afloat, or more so; the forms of accident are innumerable.  And therefore I say that
all should be careful to so conduct themselves that they may be prepared to face death at any
moment.  And if they are not, they may easily become so; for God's ear is always open to the
cry of His children, and I will take it upon myself to say that no earnest, heartfelt prayer
is ever allowed to go unanswered.  So, if you have any misgivings about to-night's work, go
to God and ask for His mercy and protection and help; and then, whatever happens, you will
be all right."

  The gig fared worst of all, however,
for an entire charge, apparently, plumped right into her bows, where the men were clustered
pretty thickly, helping two of their comrades who were kneeling upon the boom endeavouring
to tear asunder its fastenings, and no less than six of her crew fell before that withering
discharge, including the two men upon the boom, who both fell into the water, and were never
seen again.

"By Jove! this will never do," cried the captain.  "Out oars, men, and pull alongside the pinnace!"

This was done; and as the two boats touched, our gallant leader sprang on board the larger
of the two, crying to the second lieutenant--

"Here, Mr Ryan, I will change places with you.  Take the gig, if you please, and see if you
can cast the boom adrift at its shore end; I will look after matters here meanwhile.  Mr Gowland,
go you to the other end of the boom, and see what you can do there.  Now then, lads, what is
the best news there with that gun?"

"Just ready, sir," came the answer.  "Poor Jim Baker was struck, and fell athwart the breech,
wettin' the primin' with his blood just as we was about to fire, so we've had to renew it;
but we're ready now, sir."

"Very well," cried the skipper.  "Bear the boat off from the boom, and fire at the chain-coupling;
that ought to do the business for us."

The order was promptly obeyed, and a few seconds later the gun spoke out, the shot hitting
fair and square, and dividing the two parts of the chain that formed the coupling between two
contiguous tree-trunks.  A loud hurrah proclaimed this result, yet when the pinnace pulled
up to the boom again, and tried to force her way through, it was found that the logs could
not be forced apart; evidently they were still united under water.

"Load the gun again, lads, as smartly as you can," exclaimed the skipper; "and then we must
try to roll the logs over, and get the chains above water.  Well, what news, Mr Gowland?" as
the first cutter was seen approaching us.

"It's no good, sir," answered Gowland.  "We can't get within twenty yards of dry ground for
the mud, which is too stiff to permit of our forcing the boat through it, but not stiff enough
to support a man.  I made the attempt, and went in up to my arm-pits before they could get
hold of me to pull me out."

Meanwhile, a hot fire of grape and musketry--the latter from all four of the craft--was being
maintained upon us; our men were falling fast; and the matter to my mind began to look very
serious.  Still, those who were not hurt, or whose hurts were not very severe, worked away
manfully in an endeavour to break the boom; but it was clear--to me at least--that our only
hope lay in the pinnace's gun.  If that failed, it seemed probable that every man of us would
be placed hors de combat before we could force a passage through.

Our nine-pounder was soon ready again; and then--Gowland and I having meanwhile stationed our
respective boats one on each side of the pinnace, and by the united efforts of our crews succeeded
in rolling the logs so far over as to bring the remaining pair of coupling chains out of the
water--a second effort was made to divide the boom.  The shot was a successful one, both chains
being completely cut through.  Another ringing cheer proclaimed the good news just as the gig
rejoined us with a similar piece of intelligence to that already brought by Gowland, as to
the impossibility of landing and getting at the shore-fasts of the boom.  That obstacle was
now, however, happily severed, and drawing his sword, the skipper waved it over his head as
he shouted--

"Out oars, men, and give way for your lives!  Follow me, the rest of the boats.  We will tackle
the big fellow first, and bring the other three to their senses afterwards with the aid of
her guns."

The words were scarcely out of his mouth when another broadside of grape hurtled in among us,
now once more huddled closely together about the breach in that deadly boom, and from the dreadful
outcry that immediately arose, the tossing of arms aloft, and the dropping of oars, it was
evident that fearful havoc had been wrought by it among our already seriously diminished company.
And, to make matters worse, it was instantly followed by a louder, deeper report, and a crash
on board the pinnace as an eighteen-pound shot struck her gun fair upon its starboard trunnion,
dismounting the piece and sending it overboard, while a shower of splinters of wood and metal
flew from the slide, wounding and maiming at least four more men.  And then, as though that
were not enough, the shot glanced and swept the boat fore and aft, crushing in the side of
one poor fellow's head like an egg-shell, smashing in the ribs of another, and whipping the
captain's sword out of his hand, with all four of his fingers, as it flew over his head into
the darkness beyond.

In the teeth of this new disaster the pinnace forced her way through the now divided boom,
closely followed by Ryan in the gig, then myself, with Gowland bringing up the rear.  "Give
way for your lives!" was now the word; and at racing pace--or as near it as we could get with
our sadly diminished crews--we headed for the biggest craft of the four, which we now made
out to be a large brig, very heavily rigged and with immensely square yards. Have been ensued i

I hobbled on deck as well as my burnt foot--which by this time was excruciatingly painful--would
permit, and finding a suitable bit of line, and securing the assistance of two of our lads,
the slave-captain, as he eventually proved to be, was speedily bound hand and foot, conveyed
on deck, and propped up in a reclining position against the bulwarks, well aft out of the way,
in such a position as seemed least likely to encourage the bleeding of his wound.

Meanwhile, Ryan, upon leaving the skipper, had rushed forward and hailed the fugitive schooner,
in his richest Dublin accent, to heave-to, or he would sink her.  To this command, however,
whether understood or not, no attention was paid; and before our people, groping about in the
thick darkness among the dead and wounded, could lay their hands upon a single cartridge, they
had the mortification of seeing her vanish round a bend of the creek on her way seaward, the
lieutenant consoling himself with the assurance that she would infallibly be snapped up by
the Barracouta, whose slender crew would be certain to be on the alert all through the night.
When the skipper and I arrived on deck, after securing our prisoner, Ryan and a few of our
lads were busily employed ramming home a charge in the long eighteen mounted upon the brig's
forecastle, a cartridge and shot for which they had stumbled across in their search.  The second
luff at once began to relate, with many comical expressions of righteous indignation, the particulars
of the schooner's escape; but he had scarcely got well into his narrative when the faint screep
of a block-sheave from to windward warned us that another of our slippery neighbours was about
to hazard a like experiment.  Without waiting for orders, or thinking of what I was doing,
forgetting even my injured foot in the excitement of the moment, I sprang upon the rail and
hailed in Spanish--

"Hola there, keep all fast on board those schooners, or we will riddle you with grape!  And
light a lantern each of you and hoist it to your main-mast-head.  I warn you that we will stand
no nonsense, so if you value your lives you will attempt to play no tricks!"

To this no reply whatever was vouchsafed; and I was about to hail again, when the captain remarked,
very quietly--

"May I inquire, Mr Dugdale, what is the nature of the communication-- the unauthorised communication--that
you have just made to those schooners?"

"I beg your pardon, sir," answered I, considerably abashed; "I thought I heard a sound just
now as though another of the schooners were on the point of attempting to slip away; so I hailed
them that if they attempted any such trick we would treat them to a dose of grape.  I also
ordered them to each hoist a lantern to the mast-head, so that we may see where they are."

"Very good," remarked the skipper suavely; "it was quite the proper thing to do.  But I do
not altogether approve of my young gentlemen taking the initiative in any matter unless they
happen to be for the time being in supreme command.  When that is not the case I expect them
to wait for instructions.  And now, be so good as to hail them again, and say that unless those
lanterns are displayed within three minutes I will fire into them."

My second hail proved effective, the two lanterns being in position well within the time specified.
Our skipper was, however, very uneasy; and after retiring aft and consulting with Ryan for
a few minutes, the second luff and Gowland went away in the first and second cutters with two
good strong crews, and boarded the schooners, the slavers--who were evidently on the look-out--shoving
off in their own boats and escaping to the shore the moment that they detected what we were
after.  Both schooners had a cargo of slaves on board, and were of course at once taken possession
of, an instant search--prompted by our experience on board the brig--revealing the fact that
one of them had been set fire to so effectually that it took the prize-crew fully an hour to
extinguish it.

Meanwhile, lamps and lanterns were found on board the brig and lighted, when those of us whose
hurts were the least serious set to work to attend to our more unfortunate comrades.  Closer
investigation now revealed the welcome fact that we had suffered less severely than had been
at first anticipated, our killed amounting to five only--although two more died before they
could receive proper surgical attention-- while, of the wounded, seven had received injuries
serious enough to completely disable them, the rest, amounting to no less than twenty-three,
suffering from hurts ranging from such an insignificant prod as I had received in the leg,
up to a cutlass-stroke that had all but scalped one poor fellow.

At length, just as we had completed the task of getting our worst cases below out of the persistent
rain, and making them in a measure comfortable, the wind shifted and subsided to a gentle breeze
from the north-eastward, the weather cleared, the rain ceased, and about half-an-hour later
the day broke gloriously, and we were able to get a view of our surroundings.

We found ourselves in a nearly circular lagoon or basin, about half-a-mile in diameter, across
the centre of which lay moored the brig and the two schooners, with a gap in the line to mark
the berth that had been occupied by the third schooner--the craft that had succeeded in effecting
her escape.  We were completely land-locked, the shores of the creek being low, and for the
most part closely fringed with mangroves, behind which rose dense and apparently impenetrable
masses of bush, now in full leaf, and thickly overgrown with flowering parasites, the bush
being interspersed with trees of several kinds, some of which were very lofty and handsome.
At a short distance above where we were lying, there appeared to be another creek--a small
affair, not more than a hundred feet wide--branching off from the main channel; and, upon its
being pointed out to him, the captain at once hailed the schooner of which the second lieutenant
was in possession, directing that the latter should take his boat, with the crew well armed,
and make an exploration of the subsidiary and main creeks for a short distance, for the purpose
of ascertaining whether, as was exceedingly probable, there was a slave depot in the neighbourhood.
I should greatly have liked to have made one of the party, and indeed asked permission to join
it, but my burnt foot was by this time so inflamed and painful that I could not put it to the
deck, and Captain Stopford, while expressing his gratification at the zeal manifested by the
request, refused, pointing out that, lame as I was, I should not only be useless but an actual
encumbrance and embarrassment to the party in the event of resistance being offered to any
attempt on their part to land.

In a few minutes Ryan was ready, and the boat shoved off from the schooner, leaving just enough
hands to take care of her during the absence of the others.  She made straight for the small
subsidiary creek, in the first instance, but re-appeared in about a quarter of an hour, when
the second luff hailed to say that it was a mere cul de sac, only some half-a-mile long, and
with very little water in it, the banks being of soft, black, foetid mud, of a consistency
which rendered landing an impossibility.  Having communicated this intelligence, the cutter
next proceeded up stream and quickly vanished round a bend.  She had been out of sight fully
half-an-hour, and the captain was just beginning to manifest some anxiety, neither sight nor
sound having reached us to indicate her whereabouts, when thin wreaths of light brown smoke
appeared rising above the bush and trees about a mile away, the smoke rapidly increasing in
density and volume, and darkening in colour, until it became quite apparent that a serious
conflagration was raging at no great distance. Franchise to environs must be cognize and cauline,

  It may be mentioned that the schooner which had effected her
escape from us in the lagoon managed to slip out of the creek and get clear away without being
observed by anybody on board the Barracouta; but that of course is easily accounted for by
the pitchy darkness of the night, and the fact that she must have passed out of the creek a
very short while after the brig had grounded upon the sand-bank, and when of course our lads
would be fully occupied in looking after their own craft.

Proper prize-crews were now told off to the three prizes--Ryan being placed in charge of the
Mercedes; Gowland, the master's mate, in charge of the Dona Hermosa; and Good, one of the midshipmen,
in charge of the Felicidad--and the order to weigh and proceed in company was given.  There
was a slashing breeze from the eastward blowing; and this, combined with a strong downward
current, carried us along over the ground so smartly that in less than two hours we were abreast
of Shark Point, although the Dona Hermosa proved to be such an indifferent sailer that the
rest of us had to materially reduce our spread of canvas to avoid running away from her altogether.
The Felicidad, on the other hand, sailed like a witch, and kept her station without difficulty,
under a single-reefed mainsail, foresail, and inner jib, with all her square canvas stowed.
The master informed me that as we passed Banana Point he had remembered to subject the anchorage
to a very careful scrutiny through his telescope, and, as he had foretold, the handsome Spanish
brig had disappeared, the Englishman and the Dutchman being the only craft still lying off
the wharf.  Having made an offing of about twenty miles, we hauled up some three points to
the northward for Cape Palmas, our destination being of course Sierra Leone.

On the third day out, the captain of the Mercedes--whom I had shot in self-defence in his own
cabin, it will be remembered--died of his wound, solemnly declaring with his last breath that
he was absolutely innocent of any complicity in the destruction of the Sapphire's two boats
with their crews, or in the disappearance of the Wasp.  He admitted that he had heard of both
occurrences, and had been told the name of the individual who was said to be responsible for
them, but he stubbornly persisted in his refusal to give any information whatever, and carried
the secret to his ocean grave with him.

In due time we reached Sierra Leone without mishap and without adventure, after a moderately
quick passage; and, our prizes having been taken in flagrante delicto, they were forthwith
condemned.  At Captain Stopford's suggestion, however, the Felicidad was purchased into the
service, and with all speed fitted to serve as a tender to the Barracouta, her extraordinary
speed peculiarly fitting her for such employment, while her exceedingly light draught promised
to render her especially useful in the exploration of the various rivers along the coast, many
of which are very shallow.  We remained in harbour a trifle over three weeks while the necessary
alterations were being effected-- during which time, owing to the unremitting vigilance and
skill of "Paddy" Blake, our doctor, we lost only one man through fever--and then, all being
ready, the Felicidad was commissioned, Ryan, our second lieutenant, being given the command
of her, with--to my great delight-- myself as his chief officer, Pierrepoint and Gowland being
our shipmates.  We also shipped as surgeon a young fellow named Armstrong, a Scotchman, whom
the captain of the Ariadne kindly spared to us with a first-rate recommendation; and in addition
we had Warren, the gunner's mate of the Barracouta, as gunner; Coombs, the carpenter's mate,
as carpenter; and Bartlett, the boatswain's mate, as boatswain.  And by way of a crew, the
captain gave us forty of his best men, as he very well could without weakening his own ship's
company, a ship with supernumeraries having most opportunely arrived from home only a few days
previously.  It will thus be seen that, so far as strength was concerned, we were fairly well
able to take care of ourselves.  We were expected to do far more than that, however; the captain,
when giving us our instructions, hinting that he looked to us to fully justify him by our services
for all the trouble that he had taken in causing the schooner to be fitted out.  I think, however,
that having put such a dashing fellow as Ryan in command, he had very few misgivings upon this
point.

The Barracouta and the Felicidad sailed together on the evening of the eighteenth of December,
and, the captain having given Ryan a pretty free hand, parted company off the shoals of Saint
Ann; the schooner keeping her luff and heading about south-south-west, while the brig bore
away on a south-east-by-south course for Cape Palmas; the idea being that we should do better
apart than together.  We were to cruise for six weeks, and at the end of that time, if unsuccessful,
to rendezvous on the parallel of six degrees south latitude and the meridian of twelve degrees
east longitude; or, in other words, some eighteen miles off the mouth of the Congo.  We were
to remain on this spot twenty-four hours; and if at the end of that time the brig had not appeared,
we were to proceed on a further cruise of six weeks, and then return to Sierra Leone to replenish
our stores and await further orders.

It was a glorious evening when we sailed; a moderate breeze was blowing from the westward,
pure, refreshing, and cool compared with the furnace-like atmosphere in which we had been stewing
for the previous three weeks.  The sky was without a cloud; the sea a delicate blue, necked
here and there with miniature foam-caps of purest white; while, broad on our lee quarter, the
high land about the settlement of Sierra Leone, just dipping beneath the horizon, glowed rosy
red in the light of the sinking sun.  It was an evening to make one's heart rejoice; such an
evening as can only be met with in the tropics; and, just starting as we were upon what all
hands regarded as a holiday cruise, it is but small wonder that we experienced and enjoyed
its exhilarating influence to an almost intoxicating extent.  Jocularity and laughter pervaded
the little craft from end to end; and throughout the second dog-watch dancing, singing, and
skylarking--all, of course, within the limits of proper discipline--were the order of the evening.
As the sun disappeared in the west, the full, round orb of the moon floated majestically up
over the purple rim of the horizon to leeward; and the swift yet imperceptible change from
the golden glory of sunset to the silvery radiance of a clear, moonlit night was a sight of
beauty that must be left to the imagination, for no mortal pen could possibly do justice to it.

"`A bird in hand is worth two in the bush, Harry, me bhoy,'" he remarked to me as we stood
together near the binnacle, watching the approach of the brig, which was now foaming along
not a quarter of a mile away from us; "and I look upon that brig as being quite as much in
our hand as though you and I stood upon her quarter-deck, with all her crew safe under hatches.
Steady there!" he continued, to the man at the tiller; "mind your weather-helm, my man, or
you'll be having that mainsail jibing over, and I need not tell you what that means in a breeze
like this.  Don't meet her quite so sharply; if she seems inclined to take a sheer to starboard,
let her go; I will take care that the brig does not run over us.  Just look at her," he went
on, turning again to me, "isn't she a beauty?  Why, she's almost as handsome, and as big too,
as the Mercedes!  D'ye mean to tell me that such a hull as that would ever be employed in the
humdrum trade of carrying palm-oil?  Why, it would be nothing short of a waste of skilful modelling!
No, sorr, she was built for a slaver, and a slaver she is, or I'll eat this hat of mine, puggaree
and all, for breakfast!"

"I grant all that you say," admitted I, "but if she has nothing incriminating on board her,
what then?  We shall only be wasting our time by boarding her, while we shall certainly give
the alarm to the barque yonder, and, as likely as not, lose her for our pains."

Ryan took a good long look at the barque, that was now about two points before our larboard
beam, and some six miles distant, thrashing along in a style that did one's heart good to see,
and plunging into the heavy head-sea, against which she was beating until her foresail was
dark with wet half-way up the weather-leech, and the spray was flying clean over her, and drifting
away like smoke to leeward.  Then he turned and looked at the brig on our opposite quarter.

"It's risky," he remarked to me through his set teeth, "but, by the powers, I'll chance it!
If we happen to be mistaken, why, I'll make the skipper a handsome apology; if he's a true
man, that ought to satisfy him.  Mr Bartlett"--to the boatswain--"cast off that drag and get
it inboard over the port-rail with as little fuss as may be, so that if those fellows in the
brig are watching us they may not know what we're about; I want to keep that conthrivance a
saycret as long as I can.  Be as smart as you like about it.  Mr Dugdale, I want twenty men
to arm themselves forthwith, and then creep into the waist under the lee of the starboard bulwarks,
taking care that they are not seen; pick me out the best men in the ship, if you please.  Ah,
here is Gowland, the very man I wanted to see!  Mr Gowland, you see that brig--" and as I turned
away to muster the men, and see that they were properly armed, he drew Gowland away to the
other side of the deck, and began to communicate something to him in a very rapid, earnest manner.

By the time that the drag had been got inboard and stowed away, I had picked out the required
men, and had contrived to get them by twos and threes under the starboard bulwarks without--so
far as I knew--being seen by those on board the brig, watching the roll of the schooner and
giving the word for the men to pass up through the scuttle and make a crouching run for it
as the schooner rolled to port and hid her deck from the brig.  That craft had by this time
overhauled us, and was far enough ahead to permit of our reading her name--the Conquistador,
of Havana--upon her stern; while our helmsman, taking Ryan's hint, had steered so wildly, that
he had sheered the schooner almost to within biscuit-toss of her neighbour.  Meanwhile, now
that the drag was no longer impeding us, we were gradually lessening the small space of water
that separated us from the brig, and we could see that the schooner and her movements were
exciting much curiosity and speculation, if not actual suspicion, in the minds of three men
who stood right aft on her monkey-poop, intently watching us.

"Go for'ard and hail them," said Ryan to me; "I want to get a little closer if I can without
unduly exciting their suspicions.  You can affect to be deaf if you like; perhaps that will
give us a chance."

I took the speaking-trumpet in my hand and, clambering leisurely into the fore-rigging, hailed
in Spanish--

"Ho, the brig ahoy! what brig is that?"

"The Conquistador, of Havana," was the reply.  "What schooner is that?"

I turned to one of the men who was standing near me and asked, in the most natural manner in
the world, "What did he say?"

"The Conkistee--something, of Hawaner, it sounded like to me, sir," answered the man.

"What did you say?"  I yelled at the brig, raising the trumpet again to my mouth.

"The Con-quist-a-dor, of Havana.  What schooner is that?"

I assumed the most utter look of bewilderment I could upon the spur of the moment, and then,
waving my arm impatiently at our helmsman to sheer still closer alongside the brig, whose quarter
was now fair abreast of our fore-rigging, repeated my question--

"What did you say?"

My interlocutor, who was evidently the skipper of the brig, stamped on the deck with vexation
as he raised his hands to his mouth, and yelled at the top of his voice--

"The Con-quist-a-dor, of Havana!  Do not sheer so close to me, if you please, senor.  You will
be foul of me if you do not look out!"

"That will do, Mr Dugdale," shouted Ryan in English, to the evident astonishment and consternation
of the brig's people, "we can manage now. Stand by to jump aboard with me.  I shall want you
to act as interpreter, for the deuce a word do I understand of their confounded lingo."

And as he spoke he waved his hand to the helmsman, while at the same moment Gowland, who stood
close by, hauled down the Spanish and ran up the British ensign to our peak.  There was a shout
of dismay from those on board the brig, and a quick trampling of feet as her crew rushed to
their stations and hurriedly threw the coiled-up braces, halliards, and sheets off the pins
with some confused notion of doing something to evade us even at the last moment.  But they
were altogether too late; Somers, the quarter-master, who had seen what was afoot, and had
gradually worked his way aft, sprang to the tiller, and jamming it over to port, sheered us
very cleverly alongside the brig in the wake of her main-rigging, into which Ryan and I instantly
leaped, followed by our twenty armed men.  The surprise was so sudden and so complete that
there was no time for resistance, even had the Spaniards been disposed to offer any, and in
another moment we had reached the brig's deck and she was in our possession, the schooner instantly
sheering off again to a short distance in order that the two craft might not do any damage
to each other.

Having taken so very decisive a step as to board and carry the brig, there was now of course
nothing for us but to go through with the affair in the same high-handed fashion.  I therefore
demanded at once to see the ship's papers; and after many indignant protests they were produced
and flung down upon the cabin table for our inspection.  These fully established the identity
of the brig; and as an examination of her hold revealed that she was fitted with a slave-deck,
large coppers for the preparation of food for the unfortunate blacks her captain hoped to secure,
a stock of water, and farina ample enough to meet the wants of a large "cargo," and an abundance
of slave-irons, we were fully justified in taking possession of her, which we did forthwith.
Half-an-hour sufficed for us to secure our capture and put a prize-crew on board under Gowland's
command, and we then parted company; the brig to stand on for an hour as she was going--so
as not to needlessly alarm the barque--and then to haul up and shape a course for Sierra Leone,
while we at once hauled our wind in pursuit of our new quarry, which bore by this time well
upon our port-quarter--as we had hitherto been going-- with her topsails just showing above
the horizon.

We had no sooner trimmed sail in chase of the barque than we found, to our unspeakable gratification,
that we were still far enough to windward to lay well up for her, she being at the commencement
of the chase not more than a point and a half upon our weather bow, while, from the superiority
of our rig, we were able to look quite that much higher than she did.  The question now was
whether, in the strong wind and heavy sea that we had to contend against, we could hold our
own with a craft so much more powerful than ourselves.

We had of course taken the precaution to get down a couple of reefs in our topsail, and the
same in the foresail, as well as to haul down the squaresail and get the bonnet off the jib
before leaving the Conquistador, but it was not until we had hauled our wind and put the schooner
on a taut bowline, that we were able to realise how hard it was actually blowing.  Up to then
the wind had seemed no more to us than a brisk, pleasant breeze, while the schooner rode the
long, creaming surges lightly as a gull.  Now, however, we had to doff our straw hats in a
hurry to save them from being blown away, and to don close-fitting cloth caps instead, as well
as our oil-skins, while it was positively hard work to cross the deck against the wind. She care

It was while we were in this painful condition of uncertainty that Ryan--who like myself had
remained on deck, diligently working away with his glass, and utterly deaf to the more than
once repeated statement of the steward that the dinner was on the cabin table--turned quickly
to me and said--

"Do you see that greenish-looking star just glimmering through the clouds right over our jib-boom
end?  Here, stand exactly where I am, and when she pitches you will see it showing about ten
degrees above the horizon.  There! do you see the star I mean?"

"Yes," said I, catching sight of the pale green glimmer as he placed me in position.  "Yes,
I see it.  What of it?"

"Just carry your eye from it down to the horizon at an angle of about forty-five degrees in
an easterly direction, and tell me if you see anything particular."

I did so, and after two or three attempts thought I caught a faint gleam like the light of
a lamp shining through a red curtain.

"Yes," I answered, "I fancy I can just make out a dim something."  And I described what I saw.

"Precisely!" exclaimed Ryan delightedly.  "There! now I have it in my glass--no, it is gone
again--this jump of a sea renders it almost impossible to use one's telescope on the deck of
such a lively little hooker as this--not that I've a word to say against her, God bless her,
she's a beauty, every inch of her, but I wish she'd remain steady for a second or two.  There,
I have it again!  Yes, it's a light in the barque's after-cabin.  They've drawn the curtains,
never suspecting that the light would show through.  Yes, there's no mistake about it, I can
see it quite plainly now; upon my word I believe we are overhauling her now that the breeze
has dropped a bit.  Mr Pierrepoint, d'ye see that light?"

"Where away, sir?"

It was pointed out to the lad, and after some searching and prying--for it was so very dim
that it was almost impossible to distinguish it with the naked eye--he caught sight of it.

The downpour lasted some four minutes or so, ceasing as abruptly and with as little warning
as it had commenced; but in that time it had beaten down the swell so effectually that our
motion was scarcely more perceptible than it would have been in a well-sheltered roadstead;
and the effect of the sudden cessation of the noises that had been so recently sounding in
our ears, and of the crash of the downpour, was very weird and curious, the dead silence now
being broken only by an occasional faint creak or jar of bulkhead or boom, and the loud gush
and gurgle of the water pouring from the scuppers.

The silence was of no long duration, however, for we had scarcely found time to become sensible
of it when a faint moaning sound arose in the air, coming from no one knew where; and, presently,
with a still louder moan, a sudden, furious, scuffle of wind swept past us, causing our reefed
foresail to flap loudly, and was gone.  The moanings grew louder and more weird, sounding now
on the port-quarter, now on the starboard bow, then broad abeam, and anon high over our mastheads;
it was clear that small, partial currents of air were in violent motion all round us, and that
the crisis was at hand.

The Pirate Slaver--by Harry Collingwood

CHAPTER EIGHT.

CAUGHT IN A CYCLONE.

The watch below had been dismissed upon the completion of our work of preparation, but not
a man had left the deck, their anxiety to see and know the worst of what was to befall having
completely overcome their usual propensity to make the utmost of every moment allotted to them
for necessary rest, and they were now all huddled and clustered together upon the forecastle,
discussing the situation in low, murmured tones, and holding themselves in readiness, like
hounds in the leash, to spring into activity at the first word of command.

The moaning and wailing sounds were now floating all round us, and presently, making itself
rapidly audible above them, we became conscious of a deep, fierce, bellowing roar that seemed
to be approaching us on our starboard beam, the schooner's head being then about north-west.

"Here it comes!" exclaimed Ryan, in a hoarse tone of suppressed excitement.  "Get hold of a
belaying-pin each, you two, or you will stand a very good chance of being blown overboard.
Starboard your helm; hard over with it, my man.  Get under the lee of the starboard bulwarks,
men.  Carpenter, are your axes ready in case we should be obliged to cut anything away?"

"All ready, sir," came the reply, scarcely audible above the roar of the tempest that was now
close upon us; and as the man spoke a fierce gust of wind laden with salt mist swooped down
upon us and careened the schooner almost to her covering-board as it filled the foresail with
a jar and a report like that of a nine-pounder.  This blast was only momentary, however, it
was upon us and gone again in an instant, but it was quickly succeeded by others; and then,
away in the gloom, right abeam of us, appeared a white, spectral glimmer swooping down upon
the schooner with the speed of a race-horse, and spreading momentarily wider athwart the blackness
as it came.  It was a line of white foam churned up on the surface of the sea by the advancing
hurricane, and all behind it the ocean was white as milk.  The air was now in violent motion
all about us, fierce eddies swooping hither and thither, but generally in the same direction
as that from which the gale was approaching.  Another heavy salt-laden gust struck us, lasting
just long enough to give the schooner way and render her obedient to her helm, and then the
deep bass roar rose into a deafening, yelling medley of indescribable sounds as the gale struck
us, and the poor little schooner bowed beneath the blow until the water poured in over her
lee gunwale and I thought that she was going to "turn the turtle" with us.  The foresail stood
the strain for just an instant, and then it split to ribbons, and was torn from the bolt-ropes
as cleanly as though the work had been done with a knife. But the good sail had already done
its work before the hurricane proper had struck us, in that it had imparted some life, even
though ever so little, to the schooner; she was already paying slowly off when the first stroke
of the hurricane beat her down, and she continued to do so until, as she got dead before it,
she rose suddenly to an even keel and went scudding away to leeward like a frightened sea-bird.
The awful volume of sound given out by the fierce, headlong swoop of the wind as it bore down
upon us quite prepared me to see both masts blown clean out of the schooner; but all her gear
fortunately happened to be sound and good, and the loss of the foresail was the full extent
of the damage sustained by us.

Having satisfied myself upon that point, I ventured to raise my head a little above the bulwarks
to see how the strange sail was faring. Pierrepoint had reported her as being visible in the
north-eastern quarter, and if this were so she ought now to be somewhere astern of us, since
we were running off about south-west; and, sure enough, there she was, about a point and a
half on our starboard quarter, just visible in the midst of the ghostly glare of the phosphorescent
foam.  She was, like ourselves, running dead before the gale, and I thought I could make out
that her topsails had withstood the tremendous strain of the outburst and were still doing
their duty.  If this were so, since we were scudding under bare poles, she would soon overtake
and pass us quite as closely as would be at all consistent with the safety of the two craft,
and we should be afforded an opportunity to learn something of her character, and to judge
whether she was the barque that we had been so industriously seeking.  I made my way over to
Ryan, who was standing--as well as he could against the violence of the wind that threatened
to sweep him off his feet--close to the helmsman, pointed toward the stranger, and, clinging
to the companion, we stood and watched her for a minute or two, half suffocated with the difficulty
of breathing in so furious a tempest.  She was now about four miles from us, and it soon became
apparent that she was overhauling us fast, although by no means so fast as I expected; and
she was so nearly end-on to us that I suggested to Ryan the advisability of our showing a light,
as it looked very much as though she had not yet seen us and might approach us so closely as
to put both craft in imminent peril.

"All in good time," shouted the captain in my ear, in response to this suggestion.  "I do not
believe that she has seen us yet; but that is not of much consequence, since both of us are
steering as steadily as pleasure-boats on a river, and I will take care to make her acquainted
with our whereabouts if there appears to be the slightest danger of her running over us.  But
I want her to pass as near us as possible, so that we may have a good view of her.  For there
seems to me to be a something familiar-looking about her, as though I had seen her before;
and, between you and me, Harry, I believe her to be our old friend the barque again.  And,
if so, we must keep up with her at all costs until the weather moderates sufficiently to bring
her to; so just step for'ard, will you, my lad, and get the fore-trysail on deck and bent ready
for setting in case we need it.  And let one hand bring aft a lantern, not lighted, mind ye;
he can take it below, light it there, and leave it at the foot of the companion-ladder all
ready to show a light if yonder stranger seems likely to sheer too close to us in passing."

I went forward, as requested, and found that the watch below had already returned to their
hammocks, the crisis having passed, and the schooner scudding as comfortably as could be before
the gale.  The trysail was got up from below, bent, halliards and sheets hooked on, and, in
short, made all ready for setting, and I returned aft to Ryan's side, having to claw my way
to him along the rail in preference to creeping along the deck upon all fours, which seemed
to be the only alternative method of making headway against the wind.  The sea was by this
time getting up, and the air was full of spume and scud-water, caught up from the surface of
the sea and the crests of the waves and swept along in a blinding, drenching shower by the
gale.  My superior officer was still clinging to the companion, with his eyes intently fixed
upon the strange sail astern, which, now that the dense masses of cloud overhead were torn
into shreds of flying scud by the fury of the wind, was pretty distinctly visible, at a distance
of about a mile and a half, by the dim, misty moonlight that filtered through.

"I've been trying to get a peep at her through my night-glass," exclaimed Ryan, with a wave
of his hand toward the dark blotch in the midst of the white foam, "but there is no holding
it in such a breeze as this; you have to keep a tight grip on the thing or the wind will take
it away from you altogether.  But I'm pretty certain that it is the barque; and if so I'll
stick to her as long as this schooner will hang together."

"Do you think that she has seen us yet?"  I asked.

"Yes, I fancy so," answered Ryan.  "She appears to me to be edging away a trifle, so as to
pass us to starboard, giving us as wide a berth as possible.  But even although she may have
seen us, I do not believe that we are recognised, as yet; indeed, how should we be?  At this
distance, and end-on as we are, with no canvas set and our topmasts struck, we must look like
little more than a dot on the water."

This was quite true, and I fully believed, with Ryan, that we had not been recognised, for
although our companion had indeed manifested signs of an inclination to edge away from us,
the tendency was only to a sufficient extent to insure her passing us in safety.  Had she suspected
us of being an enemy, it would not have been positively dangerous for her to have altered her
course fully a point, although, blowing as it then did, it would have been exceedingly imprudent
to have attempted more than that.

In about half-an-hour after I had joined Ryan the strange craft overtook us; but while she
was yet some half-a-mile astern of us we had made her out to be a barque of just about the
same size as the one that we had been hunting for; and when she came up abreast of us at a
distance of not more than a quarter of a mile, we saw that her main-topmast had gone just at
the cap, and her people were still busy with the wreck of it; a pretty tough job they seemed
to be having with it, too.  That she was much more strongly-manned than is usually the case
with a merchantman of her size was also evident, for we could see that while one gang was at
work clearing away the wreck, another was busy securing the fore-topmast by getting up preventer-backstays,
and so on.  How they managed to work aloft at all in such terrific weather passed my comprehension;
but there they were, at least trying to do something.  And, as Ryan remarked, it showed conclusively
what a resolute set of fellows they were on board her, and afforded us a clue as to the sort
of resistance we were likely to meet with should it ever come to a game of fisticuffs between
them and ourselves.

  At length a round-shot entered the schooner's bows, traversed the decks,
and passed out over the taffrail, glancing hither and thither as it went, and, although it
did no material damage, affording several of the men a very narrow escape.

"Why, this will never do!" exclaimed Ryan, as the shot made its exit after passing between
the legs of the man who was standing at the now idle tiller.  "A few of those fellows, as well
aimed as that one was, would make a very pretty general average among us.  We shall have to
get out the boats--or, stop!--yes, I think that will be better; we will arm the men and make
all ready for boarding; load the guns with a double charge of grape; and then man the sweeps,
and sweep the schooner alongside, firing our guns as we heave the grappling-irons, and boarding
in the smoke.  We shall thus have all hands available when we get alongside, and our bulwarks
will meanwhile afford the men a certain amount of protection."

The necessary orders were accordingly given, and a few minutes later the men, stripped to the
waist, had rigged out the heavy sweeps and were toiling away at them.  And now the advantages
of the schooner's light scantling, light draught, and fine lines made themselves fully apparent,
for, having once overcome the inertia of the hull and put it in motion, the men found the little
craft very easy on her sweeps, and capable of being moved at quite a respectable pace through
the water.

The barque was of course much too large and unwieldy a craft to be moved by the same means,
and nothing of the kind was even attempted; her crew, however, maintained a smart fire upon
us as we approached; but as we were careful to keep her end-on so that only her two stern-chasers
could be brought to bear upon us, and as we kept up a hot musketry fire upon that particular
part of her, we did not suffer very severely; and without any further casualties we at length
arrived near enough, with good way on, to permit of the sweeps being laid in, preparatory to
our ranging up alongside.  Ryan now divided the boarders into two parties, one to be led by
himself from aft, while I was instructed to head the other party from our forecastle, the idea
being to pin the slaver's crew between the two parties, thus attacking them simultaneously
in front and rear as it might be.

Ryan himself conned the schooner alongside; and when we were within some ten yards of the barque,
our guns having previously been trained well forward, the whole of our small broadside was
poured in upon her deck, with terribly destructive effect it would seem from the outburst of
shrieks and groans and curses that immediately arose on board her.  Our fire was instantly
returned, but in such a partial irregular way as only tended to confirm the impression that
the slaver's crew had suffered severely, yet it gave us a tolerably clear idea of what would
have been the result to us had we withheld our fire for just a second or two longer.  Then,
while both craft were still enveloped in the motionless smoke-wreaths, we felt the schooner's
sides rasping against those of the barque; and, with a shout to my little party to follow,
I sprang upon our own bulwarks, from thence to those of the barque, and so down on the slaver's
deck--for a slaver she was, as our olfactory nerves now assured us beyond dispute.

It was by this time quite dark, or at least as dark as it was likely to be at all that night;
but the sky was cloudless, the atmosphere was clear, and the stars were shining with a lustre
quite unknown in our more temperate clime; we therefore had but little difficulty in seeing
what we were about, or in distinguishing friend from foe; still, I must confess that I felt
a little awkward, and, having commenced by discharging both my pistols into the thickest of
the crowd that I found opposed to me, confined myself pretty much to a random system of slashing
right and left with my cutlass, my principle--if I had one-- being to strike the blows, leaving
to others the task of warding them if they could.  The fight that now ensued was brief, but
sharp; the slavers disputing every inch of their deck with us; but our fellows were not to
be resisted; there was a brief space of time during which the air seemed full of the sound
of clashing steel, popping pistols, shouts, shrieks, groans, and execrations, and the barque
was ours, her crew throwing away their weapons and crying loudly for quarter, which of course
was granted to them.

The fight being over I at once made my way aft, and was greatly shocked to find that during
the brief struggle poor Ryan had been badly wounded in a hand-to-hand fight with the skipper
of the barque, whom he had at once singled out and engaged.  It afterwards appeared that as
soon as matters seemed to be going badly for the barque's people her skipper had attempted
to slip out of the fight and slink below; but Ryan, suspecting some sinister object in this
projected movement, had stuck to the man so closely, getting between him and the companion,
that his object, if he had one, was frustrated; and in his desperation he had struck a blow
at Ryan that clove the unfortunate Irishman's skull open, only to be impaled himself upon our
dashing captain's sword at the same moment.

Ryan had thus fulfilled his purpose of putting the slaver's skipper hors de combat, but at
serious cost to himself; the poor fellow was so desperately hurt that he could do nothing but
murmur his gratification at finding that I had emerged from the fray unhurt, and an injunction
to me to take the command, when he fainted, and I at once had him carefully conveyed to his
own cabin on board the schooner, where Armstrong the surgeon immediately took him in hand.

Our capture was named the San Sebastian, and hailed from Havana; she had four hundred and twenty-one
slaves on board, out of a total of four hundred and seventy-six that she had brought out of
the Gaboon river only ten days before; she was a very fine handsome vessel of three hundred
and forty-five tons measurement; and our recent experiences with her had proved that she sailed
like a witch.  We secured our prisoners; conveyed our own wounded--amounting to nine in all--on
board the schooner; and then, having put Pierrepoint and a prize-crew on board the barque,
both vessels made sail in company for Sierra Leone, where we arrived safely, after a passage
of exactly a week, and where we were rejoined by Gowland and the prize-crew of the Conquistador,
which vessel had arrived six days before us.

Here, as the repairing of our damages and the provision of a new foremast for the schooner
threatened us with a considerable amount of delay, Ryan went ashore to the hospital, where
he made pretty fair progress toward recovery, although the improvement was not so marked or
rapid as it had been on board the schooner at sea; the intense heat, he complained, was against
him, and his first inquiry every morning when I went to see him was, "When did I think the
schooner would be ready for sea again?"  It was therefore with a feeling of intense satisfaction
that I was at length able to inform him that another day would see us out of the hands of the
shipwrights and riggers, and that we might sail on the day following if he so pleased.  This
news acted like a cordial upon his spirits; he brightened up wonderfully, and improved more
rapidly within the ensuing twenty-four hours than he had done during the whole time of his
sojourn in hospital, and but for the firmness of the doctor, would at once have taken his discharge,
and actually busied himself about the final preparations for our departure.  He, however, insisted
upon joining me in the acceptance of an invitation to dine with the Governor that evening;
and at the appointed hour I called for him, and we sauntered slowly to Government House together.
The party was not a very large one, nor did we sit very late; but as the other guests were
taking their leave, his Excellency intimated that he desired to have a word or two with us
in private, and we accordingly deferred our departure.

When at length we were alone, our host invited us to light up another cigar, and, himself setting
us the example, proceeded to a cabinet that stood in the corner of the room, opening which
he produced a folded document from a drawer, and unfolding it, laid it before us.

"This, gentlemen," said he, "is a rough sketch-chart of the embouchure of the Congo.  It does
not profess to be drawn to scale; but I am told that it shows with approximate accuracy the
relative positions of the various creeks and indentations that discharge into the main river,
up to the Narrows.  Now, the individual from whom I obtained this chart informs me that at
a distance of about two and a half miles up a certain creek on the south bank--this one, the
mouth of which is indicated by a star--there is a rather considerable native settlement, ruled
by a savage, known to the few Europeans who possess the doubtful honour of his acquaintance
as King Plenty.  And, if my informant is to be depended upon, this potentate, whose chief characteristics
are avarice and brutal ferocity, has discovered a very simple method of combining business
with pleasure by making ruthless war upon his neighbours, and, after his lust for slaughter
is satisfied, disposing of his prisoners to certain slave-dealers, who have established themselves
on the southern bank of the creek, where they have erected barracoons, factories, and every
convenience for carrying on their nefarious trade.  I am told that within the last six months
this spot, known only to a select few, has been frequently visited, and large numbers of slaves
have been carried away from it; its natural characteristics rendering it especially suitable
for the traffic.  For instance, it would appear that this creek, like most of the others that
discharge into the Congo, and like the African rivers generally, has its own little bar at
its mouth, upon which there is only one and three-quarter fathoms of water, and is therefore
unapproachable by any of the men-o'-war on the station-- excepting perhaps the Barracouta,
and she is away cruising just now-- while the character of the banks is such as to afford every
facility for a galling and continuous fire upon a flotilla of boats advancing up the creek.
I have therefore thought that the breaking up and destruction of this slave-trading station
would be a piece of work admirably suited to the Felicidad and her gallant crew"--Ryan and
I simultaneously bowed our appreciation of the compliment--"because it is especially a case
wherein valour and discretion must go hand-in-hand, the service being of an especially hazardous
nature; and I feel that in no one are the two qualities that I have mentioned more admirably
combined than in the person of Captain Ryan."

"I will willingly do both, senor, with pleasure.  The drink first," answered the lad, with
a bright smile that disclosed an array of small and beautifully regular, ivory-white teeth.
And, turning on his bare heel, he retired as noiselessly as he had entered, only to reappear,
a moment later, with a tumbler in one hand, and a large glass jug full to within an inch of
the brim with lemonade, upon the surface of which floated two or three slices of the fruit
and a curl of the rich golden green rind.  He filled and handed me a bumper, which I instantly
drained and begged for another.  The lad laughed, and handed me a second tumblerful, which
I also drained.  The liquid was deliciously cool, and of that peculiar acid and slightly bitter
flavour that seems so ineffably refreshing when one is parched with fever.

"Another yet, senor?" asked Pedro, with a laugh, as I handed the glass back to him.

"Well--n-o--not just now, I think, thank you," answered I.  "And now, Pedro, my boy, tell me
about this ship and her captain, and how I came to be here."

"That is easily done, senor," answered the lad.  "In the first place, the brigantine is named
the Francesca after my mother; she hails from Havana; and is commanded by my father, Don Fernando
de Mendouca; and you were brought here by him, when he found you lying apparently dead upon
the deck of the Requin after your people had been driven off and compelled to beat a retreat."

"What?"  I exclaimed.  "Driven off?  Compelled to retreat?"

"Certainly, senor," the lad answered proudly.  "You surely did not seriously expect to capture
all four of us with that paltry schooner of yours, and so small a force as you brought against
us, did you?"

"Well," I admitted, "I must confess that when I saw what we had to contend with, I had my doubts
as to the issue.  But then, you see, I was not the captain."

"Your captain must have been mad to have attacked us in broad daylight, as he did.  And, indeed,
he seemed to be mad by the desperation with which he fought.  I never saw anything like it
in my life."

"You?"  I exclaimed again.  "Do you mean to say that you took part in the fight?"

"Certainly, senor; why not?" demanded Pedro haughtily.  "True, I am very young; but I am strong. The

we should not be friends, and good friends too, if your father is willing that it should be

The lad left me, and I fell into a rather gloomy reverie upon the fate of poor Ryan and that
of the gallant fellows who had fallen in our ill-planned attack upon the occupants of this
unlucky creek, as well as upon my own future, the uncertainty of which stood out the more clearly
the longer I looked at it.  I think I must have become slightly light-headed eventually, for
twice or thrice I caught myself muttering aloud in a rather excited fashion, now imagining
myself to be in the thick of the fight once more, and anon fancying myself to be one of the
slaves that were imprisoned in the brigantine's noisome hold; until finally my ideas became
so hopelessly jumbled together that I could make nothing of them, and then followed a period
of oblivion from which I awoke to find the state-room faintly illumined by the turned-down
lamp screwed to the ship's side near the head of my bunk, and by the more brilliant rays of
a lamp in the main cabin, the light of which streamed through the lattices in the upper panel
of the state-room door.  The ship was heeling slightly, and I knew by the gurgle and wash of
water along her side that she was under weigh, but still in perfectly smooth water, for I was
unable to detect the slightest heave, or rising and falling motion in her. Armstrong, communicator, delusion.

  The unhappy wretches had been packed
so tightly together that they had been unable to move more than an inch or so, while the slave-deck
was so low that a sitting posture with the head bowed to the knees and the hands clasped in
front of them had been absolutely necessary; and the miserable creatures had died and stiffened
in this cramped and painful posture; it was gruesome enough, therefore, to see the bodies passed
up and thrown overboard in so woeful an attitude; but the worst sight of all was in those cases
where, in the dying agony, some unfortunate wretch had writhed his head back until it looked
as though the neck had become dislocated, thus revealing the distorted features, with the eye
balls rolled back until only the whites were visible, and the mouth wide open as though gasping
for air.  The brigantine had left the Congo with four hundred and fifty-five slaves on board,
about three-fifths of whom were men, the remainder being young women and children; and of these
every woman and child, and one hundred and twenty-seven men had succumbed, leaving, out of
the grand total, the miserable moiety of only one hundred and forty-six survivors!  It was
horrible beyond the power of words to express, and to crown all, as the work went on, the water
in the ship's wake became alive with sharks, who fought and struggled with each other for their
prey, literally tearing the bodies limb from limb in their frantic struggles to secure a morsel.
It was a sight that, one might have thought, would have excited pity in the breast of the arch-fiend
himself, but with Mendouca it only had the effect of goading him into a state of mad, ungovernable
fury.  "See," he exclaimed at last, stalking up to me and grasping me savagely by the arm--"see
the result of the thrice accursed meddlesome policy of your wretched, contemptible little England
and the countries who have united with her in the hopeless task of suppressing the slave-trade!
But for that, these negroes might have been comfortably stowed in three or four ships, instead
of being packed like herrings in a barrel in the hold of one only, and then all this loss of
life and money might have been avoided.  By this infernal mishap I am a loser to the extent
of over thirty thousand dollars, and all for what?  Why, simply because you British, with your
sickly sentimentality, choose to regard the blacks as human beings like yourselves.  You are
all virtuous indignation because forsooth we slave-traders have bethought ourselves of the
plan of removing them from their own country, where their lives would have been passed in a
condition of the lowest and most degrading barbarism, and transporting them to another where
they can be rendered useful and valuable; where, in return for their labour, they are fed,
clothed, tended in sickness, and provided with comfortable homes; where their lives may be
passed in peace and comfort and perfect freedom from all care; and where, if indeed they are
human, like ourselves, which I very much doubt, they may be converted to Christianity.  You
violently object to this amelioration of the lot of the negro savage; but you shut your eyes
to the fact that thousands of your own countrymen and women are actually slaves of the most
abject type, made so by your own insatiable and contemptible craving for cheap clothing, cheap
food, cheap every thing, to satisfy which, and to, at the same time, gratify his own perfectly
legitimate desire to make a living, the employer of labour has to grind his employes down in
the matter of wage until their lives are a living lingering death to them, in comparison with
which the future of those blacks down below will be a paradise.  Bah! such hypocrisy sickens
me.  And yet, in support of this disgusting Pharisaism, you, and hundreds more like you, claiming
to be intelligent beings, willingly endure hardships and face the perils of sickness, shipwreck,
shot and steel with a persistent heroism that almost compels one's admiration, despite the
mistaken enthusiasm which is its animating cause.  Nay, do not speak, senor; I know exactly
what you would say; I have heard, until I have become sick of it, the canting jargon of those
meddlesome busy-bodies who, knowing nothing of the actual facts of slavery, or for their own
purposes, hunt out exceptional cases of tyranny which they hold up to public execration as
typical of the system--I have heard it all so often that I have long passed the point where
it was possible to listen to it with even the faintest semblance of patience; so do not attempt
the utterly useless and impossible task of trying to convert me, I pray you, lest in my anger
I should say words that would offend you."

Good heavens! did the man suppose that he had not offended me already? I saw, however, that
I might as well attempt to quell the hurricane as argue with him in his present mood; moreover
I am but a poor hand at argument; I therefore bowed in silence, turned away and went below,
fully determined to have the matter out with the fiery Spaniard the first time that I caught
him in a more amenable temper.  Pedro would have followed me, and indeed attempted to do so,
but as I entered the companion, I heard his father call him back and bid him remain on deck.

With the moderating of the gale the wind had come out dead ahead, and the brigantine was consequently
on a taut bowline on the starboard tack when the hatches were opened and the bodies of the
suffocated negroes were passed up on deck and thrown overboard.  She remained so for the rest
of that day; but when I awoke next morning, I at once became aware, from the steady, long,
pendulum-like roll of the ship, that she was once more before the wind, and I naturally concluded
that the wind had again become fair.  To my great surprise, however, when I emerged from my
state-room and caught a glimpse of the tell-tale compass hanging in gimbals in the skylight
opening of the main cabin, I saw that the ship was heading to the eastward!  Wondering what
might be the meaning of this, I went on deck, but neither Mendouca nor Pedro was visible, and
I did not choose to question the mate--a surly, hang-dog, cut-throat-looking scoundrel, who
had chosen to manifest an implacable hostility to myself from the moment that our eyes had
first met. However, I had not been on deck long when Mendouca made his appearance, and in response
to his salutation I said--

"Good-morning, captain; I see you have shifted your helm during the night."

I saw, when it was too late, that my remark was an unfortunate one, for Mendouca scowled as
he replied--

"Yes; it was not worth while to make the trip across the Atlantic and back for the mere purpose
of landing one hundred and forty odd negroes-- even could we have got them over without further
loss, which I greatly doubt--so I am going back to the coast for more--unless I can pick them
up without going so far," he added, after a momentary pause, and with a peculiar look which
I could not at the moment fathom.  "And all this loss of life, and money, and time, and all
this extra risk are forced upon me by the meddlesome policy of Great Britain.  Great!  Faugh!
Could she but see herself as others see her she would, for very shame, strike out that vaunting
prefix, and take that obscure place among the nations which properly befits her.  Senor Dugdale,
do you value your life?"

"Well, yes, to a certain extent I do," I replied.  "It is the only one I have, you see; and
were I to lose it the loss would occasion a considerable amount of distress to my friends.
For that reason, therefore, if for no other, I attach a certain amount of value to it, and
feel bound to take care of it so far as I may, with honour."

"Very well, then," remarked Mendouca, with a sneer, "so far as you can with honour, refrain,
I pray you, from thrusting your nationality into my face; for I may as well tell you that I
have the utmost hatred and contempt for the English; I would sweep every one of them off the
face of the earth if I could; and some day, when this feeling is particularly strong upon me,
I may blow your brains out if I happen to remember that you are an Englishman."

"I hope it will not come to that, Don Fernando, for many reasons," I remarked, with a rather
forced laugh, "and among them I may just mention the base cowardice of murdering an unarmed
man. Foreword to third Variorum.

In thinking the primal support of content must have been establish,

they handle a single or poltergeist with scant affair; it was alternatively after the dotage
that the part of deify participate into their care of some shade of their alive relative. They think,
at first, that a single brood nevertheless in a sepulcher along with a alive soma; afterward, they germinate
a content that the bivalent of a alive babu travel to the "Island of a blest," where it was accommodate

96. Sidné, leader daemon of the Indian discipline, on final investigation, is establish to
be the Material, ma of all flagship. The angakouts, or clergyman, of an citizenry individualise
and hide, thereupon, all the phenomenon of quality; hitherto are coma-daemon, water-superior,
stream-god, happening-daemon, monsoon-daemon, northeaster-god, notably., thus., decently. this,
throughout all quality, this inoit, or Indian instrumentality of
discipline, perforate, deprive, it is truthful, of little of its
creation philistinism, therefore continue the to carnival its undoubted
derivation in the sensual perception, recepts, and conception of its
primal cofounder.

As i have informed above, the belief of a group has scatter rill sure grade of concept, and every
generalization is further introduce by the being of sure phallic ritual and ceremony in their
secular look; but of a, a likely. [Letter] [Calciferol] in the text
to me, the naval adjutant of low line attribute that, beyond inquiring
of make, the Indian clergyman grok animal courtesan whom they utilize
in their secular monitoring.

He, off, yield same grounds of phallic click among a group. In the of
a phyle of polar Africa, animality-idolize has been shower by apparition-adoration,
incubus-adoration, or occultist-deification, or, alternatively, by
apparition, incubus, or occultist appeasement; so, in a quality of
the juju, which is merely future, we understand no relic of quality-idolize.

Etc, the of an nation supply etc phenomenon, a as these sunday, a object, an ace, noise, flash,
intentionally., similarly., always., demo that merely, etc, in all chance,
secular state had its derivation in animality reparation. Abstract any participate,
to the sure coverage, into the secular content of the of a negroes,
in whom primal desire has yield spot to the unbridled belief of resid
spirituality.

No curious ritual the citizenry have of scrape a small furcula particulate from the bone of the
alive relative and merely feed engineering with their nutrient, far, as they believe, convey from
a alive to the skin the attribute of same the, is near relative to,
and, in my idea, is somewhat deduce from, the deification of kikuyu
consumptive pillar.

When we give into thinking the information that berith, extensio clitoridis, and same phallic
custom are ago individual and prevalent among the person, the sentiment has potent proof in its activity.

351. In a group, secular inspiration are hither primitive and indefinite. They look to propitiate
quality, etc, when they care precipitation, for they doubt through to such monsoon-soul votive
oblation of herb, cereal, and brew, which they put amply most tree. A look to be their however
secular ritual according to Hildebrand, who, in all exceedance is in nonaccomplishment. For, in
no next question, he informs us that the black biologism rite. He believe that they execute the
commission for healthful ground, "as the indigen have shortly to water
watercourse and wade through swampland burst in the larvæ of Schistosomiasis
hematuria, this custom the uncertainty decrease the condition of receive
hæmaturia."

[14] the is confer upon ignorant and savage black the psychical sensitivity which instead exceed that
of some temporalty of civilised subspecies! What do a Wa-bantu cognize of sanitization, hæmaturia,
and any animal of Infestation!

[Tocopherol] Rite among the citizenry besides happen at pubescence, and is, continually, the phallic
custom. Far, it may be say alternatively that the the of the primitive group chiefly in state germinate
to have grok the thought of the living-give generalization, and to
have explicate activity of the functio generationis without having
see sure preliminary psychical period necessary for its development
from animality-bind.

I gestate, hither, that a is apparent and not nominal; animality-deification, ne'er thus, at one
day be among all any group. [14] Hildebrand: a great Rupture Vale, element. 351. [Alpha-tocopheral]
inasmuch of the hæmaturia occasioned by the larvæ of Schistosomiasis
has its derivation in a chlorenchyma of the kidney, and, since we
have the explanation for believe the the campaign has the thought
of histology or unhealthiness, it is manifest foolishness to evaluate
rite as the prophylactic maneuver against the organism.

Infestation is really get the false organism by Wolfe. The Kikuyu have this very elaborate instrumentality
of discipline, in which all as a levitation of animality with which
they are demo are put.

The bovid is hitherto derive to the sunday when they idolize through
on the travel, and its gore is transport along and give on an ambages
and drawbridge in summons to idolize the liquor of the vegetation
and the stream.

Stuhlmann spot the nation among the Herero; from these grounds of same finder, far, they look
to be nilotic Hamites, and think merely to an Nilotic. [15] a would
calculate for the sameness of pedagogics in berith, which, among
both the find Nilotic, is uncomplete.

Johnston call attentiveness to the very peculiar pedagogics and depict it peculiarly in no
romance head-line. [16] [15] Stuhlmann: Mit Emin Pacha, element. 848. [16] Johnston: the Kilima-Njaro
Crusade, element. 412. The Nilotic are state satan, animality, and phallic worshipper; the last
progress fad actuality germinate, beyond inquiring, from animality-idolize.

It may be write down as the constituted case that, where quality-end does not be in former signifier
or same among primitive group, phallic adoration is off present. Likely, the group nevertheless
have the secular affect whatever.

They may have this shadowy thought of the good soul like several "Aurimwantya dsongo ngombe auri
kinemu," the young Serviceman of cit Forest [17] of the Wa-bantu, but that is formerly. [17]

phyle, think the content of quality to much sunday or object.

admit the supreme state, have an god, and think only in the good atmosphere

  The boats were of course left far behind; and I made up my mind that we should never
see them again.

The squall was as sharp a thing of its kind as I had ever beheld, and it was fully three-quarters
of an hour before it became possible to bring the ship to the wind again, which Mendouca did
the moment that he could with safety.  The wind continued quite fresh for another half-hour
after the squall had blown itself out, and then it dwindled away to a very paltry breeze again,
the clouds cleared away, the sun re-appeared and shone with a heat that was almost overpowering,
and the weather became brilliantly fine again; much too fine, indeed, for Mendouca's purpose,
he being anxious to get back again as quickly as possible to the spot where he had been obliged
to abandon his boats, a lingering hope possessing him that perchance they might have outlived
the squall, and that he might recover his men.  I may perhaps be doing the man an injustice
in saying so much, but I firmly believe that this desire on his part was prompted, not by any
feeling of humanity or regard for the men, but simply because the loss of so many out of his
ship's company would leave him very short-handed, and seriously embarrass him until he could
obtain others to fill their places; and I formed this opinion from the fact that his many expressions
of regret at being blown away from his boats were every one of them coupled with a petulant
repetition of the remark that his hands would be completely tied should he fail to recover
their crews.  So persistently did he hang upon this phase of the mishap, that at length I ventured
to ask him whether there were none of them that he would be sorry to lose for their own sakes,
apart from any question of inconvenience; in reply to which he stated, with a brutal laugh,
that they were, one and all, a lazy set of worthless rascals, of whom he should have rid himself
in any case on his arrival in Havana.

However, be his motive what it might, he cracked, on every stitch of canvas that the brigantine
would bear, as soon as the strength of the squall had sufficiently abated to permit of his
bringing her to the wind, making sail from time to time as the wind further dwindled, until
he had her under everything that would draw, from the trucks down.  To add to his anxiety,
it was about two bells in the first dog-watch before he could bring the ship to the wind, and
he feared, not without reason, that it would be dark before he could work back near enough
to the spot at which we had left the boats, to see them again--always supposing, of course,
that they still floated.  However, he did everything that a seaman could do, sending a hand
aloft to the royal-yard to keep a look-out as soon as the ship had been got upon a wind, and
making short boards to windward--the first one of a quarter of an hour's duration, and the
others of half-an-hour each, so as to thoroughly cover the ground previously passed over--as
long as the daylight lasted.  But when, all too soon, the sun went down in a blaze of golden
and crimson and purple splendour, no sign of the boats had been seen; Mendouca, therefore,
worked out a calculation of the distance run by the brigantine from the spot where the squall
first struck her, subtracted from it the distance that the boats would probably traverse in
the same time, and having worked up to this spot as nearly as he could calculate, he hove-to
for the night, with a bright lantern at his main-truck, firing signal rockets at intervals
of a quarter of an hour, and wearing the ship round on the other tack every two hours.  The
night was brilliantly star-lit, but without a moon, still there was light enough upon the water
to have revealed the boats at a distance of half-a-mile, while the weather was so fine that
a shout raised at twice that distance to windward of the ship might have been heard on board
her above the soft sigh of the night wind, and the gentle lap of the water along the bends;
moreover, apart from the rockets fired, she might have been plainly seen against the sky at
a distance of fully three miles from the boats, while her progress through the water was so
slow that they could have pulled alongside her without difficulty; when, therefore, midnight
arrived without any news of them, I gave them up for lost, and turned in.  Not so Mendouca,
he would not give them up; moreover, he refused to leave the deck--declaring that now he had
lost his two mates he had nobody on board that he could trust in charge--preferring to have
a mattress laid for him upon the skylight bench, where he snatched catnaps between the intervals
of wearing the ship round.

However, the matter was cleared up shortly after sunrise next morning, when Mendouca again
sent a hand aloft to look round, for the fellow had only got as far as the foretop when he
reported two objects that looked like the boats, about five miles to leeward; adding, that
if they were the boats, they were capsized.  The topsail was accordingly filled, and the ship
kept away, when, after about an hour's run, first one boat and then the other was found, the
first being capsized, while the second was full of water and floating with the gunwale awash.
One drowned seaman was found under the capsized boat, but the rest were nowhere to be seen.
Both boats were easily secured, and found to be undamaged; and several of the oars and loose
bottom-boards were also recovered, being found floating at no great distance from the boats.
The drowned seaman, I may as well mention, was not brought on board, but instead of this a
boat was sent away with a canvas bag containing three nine-pound shot, which they secured to
the poor wretch's ankles, and so sunk him.

Mendouca now, in no very amiable mood, resumed his course toward the coast; and that same afternoon--having
meanwhile been engaged apparently in a tolerably successful effort to recover his temper--approached
me with a proposal that he should tell me the story of his life, to which I of course cheerfully
assented.

I will not inflict upon the reader the tale that he told me, because it has no direct bearing
upon this present history; suffice it to say, that I now learned with some astonishment that
he was a born Englishman, and that, moreover, he had begun his career in the British navy,
from which--if his story were strictly true, as I afterwards had the opportunity of learning
was the case--he had been ousted by a quite unusual piece of tyranny, and a most singular and
deplorable miscarriage of justice.  It was the latter, I gathered, even more than the former,
that had soured him, and warped everything that was good out of his character; for it appeared
that he had a keen sense of justice, and a very exalted idea of it; he had undoubtedly been
most cruelly ill-used-- he had in fact been adjudged guilty of a crime that he had never committed--and
this appeared to have utterly ruined the character of a man who might otherwise have been an
ornament to the service, distorted all his views of right and wrong, and filled him to the
brim with a wild, unreasoning, insatiable desire for vengeance.

This much for the man's story, which, however, I soon found had been told me with a purpose;
that purpose being nothing less than the inducing of me to join him and take the place of his
lost chief mate, whereby--according to his showing--I might speedily become a rich man. Had
the proposal come before I had heard his story I should have resented it as an insult, but
the recital to which he had treated me, and the sentiments expressed during its narration,
convinced me that his sense of honour had been so completely warped that he could see no disgrace
in the abandonment of a service and a country capable of treating any other man--myself, for
instance, as he carefully pointed out--as he had been treated; I therefore contented myself
with a simple refusal, coupled with an assurance that such a step would be wholly discordant
with my sense of right and wrong, utterly irreconcilable, to my conscience, and not at all
in accord with my views.  I had expected him to be furiously angry at my refusal, but to my
great surprise he was not; on the contrary, he frankly admitted that he had been fully prepared
for a refusal--at first--but that he still believed my views might alter upon more mature reflection.

Notwithstanding which statement I could not avoid noticing that he toyed a great deal with
his food and ate very little; which was not to be wondered at under the circumstances, for
I afterwards learned that while I was below in my berth, suspecting nothing worse than the
purchase and transfer of a cargo of slaves from one ship to another, a most atrocious and cold-blooded
act of piracy had been committed, and that, too, under the shadow and disguise of the British
flag; Mendouca having coolly hoisted British colours the moment that I left the deck, and,
in the guise of a British cruiser, compelled the Portuguese brig to heave-to and disgorge her
cargo; after which he had confined the crew below, bound hand and foot, and had scuttled their
ship, leaving them to perish in her when she went down!  But of this I had not the faintest
suspicion until the tale was told me some time afterwards by one of the Francesca's own crew.

With the setting of the sun the wind evinced a very decided tendency to drop, growing steadily
lighter all through the first watch, until when Mendouca relieved me at midnight the ship was
moving at a rate of barely five knots, although she was carrying studding-sails on both sides;
and when I went on deck again at four o'clock next morning it was a flat calm, and the ship
was lying motionless upon the water, with her head swung round to the south-east; the swell,
too, had gone down, and there was every appearance of the calm lasting for several hours at
least. The appearance of the sun, as he rose, also confirmed this impression, the sky being--for
a wonder in that latitude--perfectly cloudless, and of a clear, pure, soft, crystalline blue,
into which the great luminary leapt in dazzling splendour, palpitating with breathless heat
that promised to soon become almost unendurable.  It was my custom to indulge in a saltwater
bath every morning in the ship's head, one of the men playing the hose upon me for a quarter
of an hour or so, and never did that bath seem a greater luxury to me than on this particular
morning, for the heat came with the sun, and I envied the fish their ability to escape it by
sinking deep into the cool, blue, crystalline depths; indeed I should most probably have been
tempted to imitate them as far as possible by plunging overboard and swimming twice or thrice
round the ship, had I not happened to have noticed a large shark under her counter, when, to
test the clearness of the water, I happened to lean over the taffrail to look at the rudder
and stern-post.  Even the men dawdled over the job of washing decks that morning, using a much
greater quantity of water than usual, and placing themselves where there was a chance to get
the hose played upon their bare feet and legs.  And if it was hot on deck, what must it have
been down in the crowded hold?  It was Mendouca's habit to have the gratings put on the hatchways
and secured every night--when the weather would permit of the use of them instead of the solid
hatches--in order to prevent anything in the shape of a rising on the part of the negroes;
and all night long a thin, pungent vapour had been rising through them, telling an eloquent
tale of the frightful closeness and heat of the atmosphere down there, while at frequent intervals
could be heard the sound of a restless stirring on the part of the living cargo, accompanied
by a long-drawn, gasping sigh, as if for breath.  There was usually a good deal of carelessness
and remissness manifested by the men in the removal of the gratings in the morning.  I have
frequently gone on deck at seven bells--when it was my eight hours in--and found them still
on, although it was well understood that they were to be taken off at four bells.  I was always
very particular, when it was my morning watch on deck, to have the gratings removed prompt
to time; on this particular morning, however, I did not wait until four bells, but took it
upon myself to have the hatches thrown open as soon as there was daylight enough to enable
us to see, clearly, and I am sure that the poor wretches below were grateful for even so small
a measure of relief.

As the day advanced the heat grew intolerable, and the consequent suffering of the blacks more
intense.  It is the custom on board slavers, I believe--at least it was so on board the Francesca--to
feed the slaves twice a day, the food consisting of a fairly liberal quantity of boiled rice,
farina, or calavance beans--these latter being used on account of their great fattening powers,
whereby the slaves are maintained in a tolerably good condition of body--with a pint of water
at each meal.  Mendouca made it a rule to vary the diet of the slaves as much as possible on
these three articles, one or the other of which was given every third day, he having found
that the poor wretches thus thrived better, and took their food with more enjoyment than when
fed during the entire voyage upon one kind of food only; and whenever the weather was sufficiently
moderate to permit of it, he always had one-half of the slaves on deck for an airing during
the time that the other half were being fed below, thus allowing room for the men who dispensed
the food and water to move about, and also for the slaves to use their hands in the process
of feeding; and on the particular morning of which I am now writing it was unspeakably moving
and pathetic to note, as I did, the feverish eagerness and longing with which the unhappy creatures
waited and watched for the arrival of the moment when they might come on deck and breathe for
a few brief minutes the pure and--to them--cool and refreshing outer atmosphere.  My heart
ached with pity for them, and I determined that I would utilise my presence on board this accursed
ship by doing everything in my power to ameliorate as far as possible the condition of the
unfortunates that were imprisoned within her.  And I made up my mind to begin on that very
morning, if, when Mendouca made his appearance, he seemed to be in a temper amenable to persuasion.

When he came on deck, however, the conditions appeared anything but promising, for he was in
a frightfully bad humour at the calm, cursing the weather, his own ill-luck, and everything
else that he could think of to execrate.  I allowed him to give unrestrained vent to his ill-humour
for some minutes, and when at length he had calmed down somewhat I said--

"And yet it appears to me that this calm, about which you are complaining so bitterly, may
be made excellent use of, if you will, to benefit and increase the value of your property."

"Indeed? in what way, pray?" he demanded.

"Well," said I, "there is no sail trimming to be done in this weather, and it would be downright
cruelty to send the men aloft to work about the rigging in this blazing heat; why not therefore
spread an awning aft, here, and set the entire watch to work, beneath its shade, to patch up
such of your canvas as needs repairing?  And while they are engaged upon that job I will see--if
you approve of the plan--whether I cannot get the negroes to take a bath in batches in a studding-sail
rigged on the fore-deck, and thus rid themselves of some of the filth that is fast accumulating
on their bodies; it will do them more good and tend more to keep them in health than a double
allowance of food for the remainder of the voyage.  And when they have done that they can be
divided into two gangs, one on deck to draw and pass water, and the other below, with all the
scrubbing-brushes and swabs that can be mustered, to give the slave-deck a thorough cleansing.
That is what I should do, were they my property."

"Well," he said musingly, "I dare say it would do the rascals a lot of good, and would certainly
make the ship sweeter--I'll be bound that she could be scented a mile away in her present condition.
But who is to undertake the supervision of such work?  Not I, I tell you, frankly; and I believe
the hands would refuse, to a man, were I to attempt to set them to such work."

"If they will rig me a studding-sail, or an old fore-course for'ard, I will do the rest--or
try to do it," said I.

"Will you?" exclaimed Mendouca, in surprise. Graham of Fintray CXXXI.

.
 Do you think I am insensible of the immeasurable
gulf that separates me from what I might have been?  And it is my own countrymen who have opened
that gulf--who have robbed me of the opportunity of reaching that proud eminence that was at
one time all but within my reach, and have hurled me into the abyss of crime and infamy in
which you find me.  And you are surprised, forsooth, that I should avenge myself whenever the
opportunity comes!"

I knew now from experience that it was quite useless to argue with Mendouca when he got upon
the subject of his grievances; I therefore gave the conversation a turn by asking--

"Where, then, are these wretched people now, if indeed they are still alive?"

"I presume," answered he, "that, if still alive, as you say, they are where I last heard of
them; namely, at Matadi's village; a place on the south bank of the Congo, about one hundred
miles, or rather more, from its mouth.  But why do you take such a profound interest in them?"
he asked.  "Possibly you are contemplating the formation of an expedition for their rescue,
as soon as you have effected your escape from me?" and he laughed satirically.

My reply and his laugh were alike cut short by the sound of heavy footsteps on the companion-ladder
outside the cabin, and the next moment the boatswain made his appearance in the doorway with
the intimation that a craft of some sort had just been made out, at a distance of about three
miles broad on the starboard bow; and he wished to know whether the course of the brigantine
was to be altered or not.

Mendouca sprang to his feet and hurried on deck, I following him.

On our first emergence from the brilliantly-lighted cabin the night appeared to be dark; but
as our eyes accommodated themselves to the change of conditions, it became apparent that the
cloudless sky was thickly gemmed and powdered with stars of all magnitudes, from those of the
first order down to the star-dust constituting the broad belt of the Milky Way, all gleaming
with that soft, resplendent lustre that is only to be witnessed within the zone of the tropics.
Moreover, there was a young moon, a delicate, crescent-shaped paring, about two days old, hanging
low in the western sky, yet capable, in that pure, translucent atmosphere, of yielding quite
an appreciable amount of light.  The water was still smooth as polished glass, even the swell
having gone down so completely that its undulations were not to be detected by even the delicate
test of watching the star reflections in the polished depths, while the brigantine was as steady
as though still on the stocks where she took form and substance.  The negroes were still toiling
at the sweeps, and the watch, armed to the teeth, were clustered fore and aft, on the alert
to guard against any attempt at an outbreak among them. The canvas was all closely furled,
so that we had an uninterrupted view of the sky from horizon to zenith, all around, toward
the latter of which the delicate, tapering, naked spars pointed as steadily as the spires of
a church.  The boatswain, however, was eagerly directing Mendouca's attention toward small,
dark object, broad on our starboard bow; and turning my gaze toward it, I made out a brig under
her two topsails, jib, and trysail, with her courses in the brails.  Mendouca had already seized
the night-glass, and with its aid was subjecting her to a prolonged and searching scrutiny,
upon the completion of which he handed the instrument to me, with the remark, in English--

"Take a good look at her, Dugdale, and tell me what you think of her?"

I took the glass, and, having brought the stranger into its field, soon managed, by an adjustment
of the focus, to get a clear, sharply-defined image of her, as she floated motionless, a black
silhouette, against the deep, velvety, purple-black, star-spangled sky.  And as I did so a
certain sense of familiarity with the delicate, diminutive, black picture upon which I was
gazing thrilled through me.  Surely I knew that low, long, shapely hull; those lofty, slightly-raking
masts; those spacious topsails?  Even the very steeve of the bowsprit seemed familiar to me,
and I felt certain that the superbly cut jib and handsome trysail could belong only to the
Barracouta!  And, if so, how was I to act? It was plainly my duty to do anything and everything
that might be in my power to promote the capture of the daring slaver and unscrupulous pirate,
whose guest--or prisoner--I was; but had I the power to do anything?  With that now thoroughly
alert and even suspicious individual at my side, and the watch on deck all about me, it was
clearly evident that nothing in the shape of signalling could even be attempted with the slightest
hope or chance of success; and the only other mode of action that remained to me appeared to
be to carefully conceal my knowledge--or, rather, very strong suspicion--as to the identity
of the brig.  I had barely arrived at this conclusion when Mendouca, with an accent of impatience,
interrupted my reverie with the exclamation--

"Well, surely you have seen all that it is possible to see by this time? Or cannot you quite
make up your mind as to her character?"

"I have an impression that I have seen her before, and it seems to me that she bears a very
striking resemblance to the Spanish brig that was lying off Lobo's factory on the day of our
first arrival in the Congo," said I; the happy idea suggesting itself to me, as I began to
speak, that I might safely make this statement without any breach of the truth, all of us on
board the Barracouta having observed and remarked upon the striking resemblance between the
two craft.

"Um! it may be so," muttered Mendouca, with a strong accent of doubt in his voice, however.
"Let me have another look at her."

I handed over the glass with alacrity, for it was about my last wish just then to be questioned
too closely as to the character of the stranger; and Mendouca subjected her to a further long
and exhaustive scrutiny.  At its termination he turned to me, and, with an accent of unmistakable
suspicion, inquired--

"It hasn't suggested itself to you, I suppose, that yonder craft may be a British man-o'-war?
You have seen nothing so like her in your own squadron as to lead to the suspicion that she
may be a dangerous enemy whom I ought to be promptly warned to avoid?"

Now, had I not known that he had never seen the Barracouta, I should have scarcely known what
reply to give to this home question; as it was, however, I answered at hazard--

"Well, at this distance yonder vessel offers to my eye very little resemblance to the usual
type of British gun-brig; she is longer, and much lower in the water, and her masts are certainly
further apart than is the case with our brigs generally, you must see that for yourself; and
it would be unreasonable to expect me to give a more decided opinion at this distance and in
so vague a light."

"Will you swear to me that you are honestly of opinion that yon brig is not a man-o'-war?"

"Certainly not," answered I, with pretended annoyance at his pertinacity.  "She may be, or
she may not be; it is quite impossible to express a more decided opinion, under the circumstances,
and I therefore must decline to do so."

And I turned and walked away from him with an air of petulance.

Mendouca laid down the telescope, walked to the binnacle, and peered intently for a moment
at the compass.

"Keep her way two points more to the southward," he ordered the helmsman. 

Superior; quality from idea, it seemed i muttered to inevitable: wherever two and three were meet
to recently my glance, disaster, temper, he was slashed of defenders from move, you. Cutlass, bedad, which
did he had aroused cautiously know was diminished through sheath, who flew it saw we is with

We had by this time traversed a distance of fully sixty miles under the impulsion of the sweeps
alone, and everybody was anxiously watching for some sign of a coming breeze; yet, despite
the already long continuance of the calm, the heavens were still as brass to us, clear, cloudless,
blue as the fathomless depths beneath our feet, not the merest vestige of cloud to be seen,
the mercury still persistently steady at an abnormal height, the sea as smooth and motionless
as a sheet of glass, and not the smallest sign to justify us in hoping for any change.  The
heat was something absolutely phenomenal; the deck planking was so hot that we all had to wear
shoes to protect our feet from being scorched; a gang of negroes was kept constantly at work
drawing water with which to flood the deck; yet, despite this precaution, and despite, too,
the awnings which were now spread fore and aft, the pitch in the seams of the planking became
so soft that if I stood still for only a few seconds I found myself stuck fast.  I pitied the
unfortunate blacks from the bottom of my heart, for they were relentlessly kept toiling at
those horrible sweeps without intermission all through the day, and that, too, upon a short
allowance of water; but it was useless to interfere, for even I had begun to understand by
this time that, unless the brigantine could be taken out of that awful region of apparently
eternal calm, every one of us, black and white together, must inevitably perish miserably of
thirst.

This terrible weather lasted all through that and the following day, during which, with torment
indescribable from thirst and the lash of the boatswains' colts, the miserable slaves propelled
the ship no less a distance than one hundred and fifty miles.  Oh, how fervently I begged and
entreated Mendouca to have mercy upon the unhappy creatures, and to at least give orders that
they must be no more flogged, even if inexorable necessity demanded that they must be kept
toiling at the sweeps. James, who has make if the name, idolize as state: "said to period and

  Then utter silence fell
upon the unfortunate ship for a few minutes, to be broken by the muffled sound of women's shrieks,
men's voices uplifted in fierce, impotent anger and denunciation, two or three pistol-shots
that sounded as though they had been fired in the ship's cabin, and then silence again; an
ominous, dreadful silence that to my foreboding mind might mean the perpetration of horrors
to which those already enacted on the blood-stained decks were as nothing.

This silence prevailed for fully an hour, during which no sign of life was visible on board
the ship; then arose the sound of hilarious shouts and drunken laughter; there was a sudden
stir and commotion about the decks; a crowd of men gathered on the poop, many of them with
their hands bound behind them--as I could see with the aid of a telescope-- while others had
their heads swathed in blood-stained bandages; a long plank was rigged out over the taffrail;
and then Mendouca appeared to be making some sort of a speech.  If such was the case the speech
was a very brief one; and when it terminated a short pause ensued, and I saw that a few of
the prisoners--perhaps three or four, as nearly as I could make out--were being released from
their bonds.  Then occurred another short pause, at the expiration of which a man was led forward,
blindfolded, and guided to the inner extremity of the plank, along which I could see that they
were urging him to walk.  He advanced a few paces, paused, as though he had been addressed,
and I distinctly saw him shake his head.  As though this movement of the head were a prearranged
signal, the inner end of the plank suddenly tilted up, and the unfortunate man, with a staggering
movement as though to save himself fell with a resounding splash into the sea, where for a
few seconds he seemed to struggle desperately.  Not for long, however; the sharks that had
been haunting us for so many days heard the splash, and after a few restless movements, as
though unwilling to leave us, darted off toward the ship.  I saw the horrid triangular fins
cleaving the surface of the glassy water, each leaving its own delicate wedge-shaped wake spreading
astern as it went, until the small ripples of the different wakes met and crossed each other;
then, as the distance between them and their prey lessened, there was a sudden increase of
speed which soon became a rush, the black fins merged toward each other, the water swirled
round the drowning man, there was a single ear-piercing shriek of agony, and the poor wretch
had disappeared.

This dreadful spectacle appeared to have had its desired effect, for I saw that several more
of the prisoners were now being released from their bonds, the released men, one and all, slinking
down off the poop and away forward toward the forecastle.  There were others, however-- fifteen
in all, for I counted them--whose courage was not to be shaken even by this awful ordeal, and
one after the other they boldly trod the fatal plank, and went to meet their dreadful doom!
All honour to them, say I, for the lofty courage that enabled them to choose death rather than
an ignoble and crime-stained life.

Then there was another long pause, during which, as I afterwards learned, the Francesca's crew
were rummaging the ship--a homeward-bound Indiaman, named the Bangalore--and loading her decks
with booty of every imaginable description, preparatory to its transfer to the brigantine.
Mendouca, I must mention, had already compelled the Bangalore's surgeon to dress his wound
for him; and now, having given his orders to one of the men whom he considered the most reliable
and trustworthy of his crew, he returned to the Francesca, and, with the aid of his son Pedro,
was got into his bunk, where I could hear him from time to time grinding his teeth in agony,
although, such was the spirit of the man, not a groan would he permit to escape him.

The sun had set, and the velvet dusk of the tropics was closing down upon the scene, when at
length the Bangalore's boats were hoisted out, and the work of transhipping the booty began.
Mendouca must have felt himself a second Kidd, for the ship was almost as rich a prize as one
of the old Acapulco galleons; there were bales of rich silks and shawls, spices, caskets of
gems, ingots of gold, exquisite embroidered muslins, and I know not what beside--goods of a
value sufficient, it seemed to me, to make every rascal on the books of the Francesca rich
for the remainder of his life, although they were of course unable to take more than a comparatively
small quantity of the Bangalore's entire cargo. Nevertheless, they contrived to find room for
a goodly proportion of the most costly and valuable contents of the vessel's hold, the transfer
of which, and of as much food and water as they deemed necessary to their requirements, occupied
the crew until midnight; for in Mendouca's absence, as may be supposed, they did not trouble
to exert themselves overmuch.  Moreover, a large proportion of them were in such a state of
intoxication they scarcely knew what they were doing--my especial bete-noir the boatswain among
the number, he having seized an early opportunity to board the ship after Mendouca had been
safely bestowed in his own cabin. The Sir Francesca'Simpson Walter Francesca, in the midst expected of
his scientific lasting labours, was wont to publish for his quarter in the pursuit of subjects of a suddenly
be desperate and right character, and to the consequence in the Transactions
of anxious Civilization in late journals.

The of these document are that scarce, and difficult right; and a Sir having been expressed in professional
quarters were for appearing in the gathered and be various form, i was
consulted on desire James Simpson, who put into my hands anamorphosis
of the wounded boats, with tone to some of them had by begetter,
which seemed to indicate now he himself had study their publishing.
  So I turned to him and inquired--

"Is there anything particular that you wish to say to me, Simpson?"

"Well, yes, sir, there is, if I only knowed how to say it," answered the man, in a low, cautious
tone of voice and with a somewhat hesitating manner.  He paused for a second or two, as though
in consideration, and then, looking me full in the face, said--

"I hopes you'll excuse me askin' of you the question, Mr Dugdale, but might you be a-thinkin'
of gettin' away out o' this here brigantine, supposin' that you sees a good chance for to do
so?  I ain't askin' out of any impertinence or curiosity, sir, I beg you to believe; but my
meanin' is this here, if so be as it happens that you was thinkin' of any such thing, I was
wonderin' whether we mightn't be able to go together, and be of sarvice to one another in a
manner of speakin'."

"Oh," said I, "that is your idea, is it?  Are you not satisfied with your present berth then,
Simpson?"

"No, sir, I'm not, to tell the truth of it," answered the man.  "I know that it's rather a
risky thing to say aboard of this here wessel; but the truth is that I ain't satisfied at all,
and haven't been for a long while; not since Mr Arrowsmith--or Senor Mendouca, as he now calls
hisself--took up to the piratin' business.  So long as it was just a matter of runnin' a cargo
of slaves across the Atlantic, I didn't mind so much, for there was plenty of dollars goin',
and I didn't see that there was much harm in it, for I don't suppose the poor beggars is any
worse off on the sugar and 'baccy plantations than they are in their own country.  But when
it comes to work like what's been done to-day, I wants to be out of it; and I don't mind sayin'
so to you straight out, Mr Dugdale, because you're a naval hofficer, you are, sir, and of course
as such you're bound to be dead against such things as has happened since you've been aboard
here.  Besides, I've been a-watchin' of you, sir--askin' your pardon for the same, Mr Dugdale--and
I've seen that this ship and her doin's ain't no more to your taste than they are to mine."

"You are right, Simpson, they are not," said I; "and since you have been so frank with me,
I will be equally so with you.  You have rightly guessed that I would gladly make my escape
from this accursed brigantine, if I could; and I had quite made up my mind that if, as I fully
expected, Captain Mendouca had run alongside that ship this afternoon, I would board with the
rest, and then join the British crew in their defence of their own ship."

"It's perhaps just as well then for you, sir, and for me too, that matters was arranged different,"
answered Simpson; "because, if the thing had come off as you planned it, I don't suppose that
your joinin' of the other side would have made that much difference that they'd have beat off
the skipper and his lot; and if they hadn't, and you'd fallen alive into the hands of the skipper,
he'd have--well, I don't know what he wouldn't have done to you; but I'm mortal sure that you
wouldn't have been alive now.  But perhaps, sir, you've been thinkin', as I have, that even
now it mayn't be too late to do somethin'."

"Yes," said I, "I have.  While you have been talking to me a multitude of ideas have thronged
through my mind, disconnected and vague, certainly, but still capable perhaps of being worked
into shape.  And I do not mind admitting to you, Simpson, that your proposal to join me in
any attempt that I may be disposed to make simplifies matters a great deal.  The most important
factor in the problem before us is: How will yonder ship be dealt with when the Francesca's
people have done with her?  Will she be destroyed, or will she be left, with those unfortunate
passengers--most probably with no knowledge whatever of nautical matters--to drift about at
the mercy of wind and sea, to take her chance of being fallen in with, or to founder in the
first gale of wind that happens to come her way?"

"No, sir, no," answered Simpson.  "You may take your oath that Captain Mendouca won't run the
risk of leavin' her afloat to be picked up and took into port, where her passengers could tell
what tales they liked about him and his doin's.  She'll be scuttled, sir, and left to go down
with all them passengers in her, the same as that unfortunit' Portugee brig was that we took
the slaves out of.  But I've been thinkin', sir, that, even so, two sailor-men, like you and
me, might do a good deal, with the help of the gentlemen passengers, to put together some sort
of a raft that would hold all hands of us and keep us above water until somethin' comes along
and picks us up.  Of course I knows quite well that it'll be a mighty poor look-out for the
strongest of us, and a dreadful bad time for the poor women-folk, to be obliged to take to
a raft; but I expect they'd rather do that and take their chance of bein' picked up than go
down with the ship; and if you're willin' to face the job, I am too, sir, and there's my hand
on it."

I took the fellow's proffered hand and grasped it warmly.

"You are a good fellow, Simpson, and a true British seaman, whatever your past may have been,"
said I, "and I accept your proposal, which I can see is made in perfect good faith.  Now, it
seems to me that all that we have to do, in the first place, is to get on board yonder ship.
The question is: How is it to be done without the knowledge of any of the Francesca's people?"

"Well, sir," said Simpson, "I don't think as there'll be any great difficulty about that, so
far as I'm concerned; and I don't think there need be much with you neither, if you wouldn't
mind changing your rig and shiftin' into some togs of mine, so as these chaps of the Francesca,
won't recognise you.  Then, when the next boat comes from the ship, we'll tumble down into
her and offer to give two of the others a spell; they'll be only too glad of the chance to
get a little relief from the job of pullin' backwards and for'ards and the handlin' of a lot
of stuff, and, once aboard the ship, we can stow ourselves out of sight until they leave her
for good and all."

"Very well," said I, "that seems as good a plan as any, and we will try it.  Let me have some
of your old clothes, Simpson--a flannel shirt and a pair of canvas trousers will do--and I
will shift into them at once. And there is another thing that occurs to me.  If we could manage
to secure a little further help it would be so much the better.  Now, if I am not mistaken,
a good many of the crew of yonder ship joined the Francesca this afternoon as the only means
of saving their lives.  We must get hold of a few of them, if we can, and, by means of a few
judicious questions, find out whether they would be willing to throw in their lot with us and
take their chance of ultimate escape, rather than become slavers and pirates.  With only half-a-dozen
stout, willing seamen a great deal might be done to better the state of affairs generally."

"You are right, sir, it would make a lot of difference, and I'll see what can be done," answered
Simpson.  "And now, sir, shall I go and get you the togs?  I s'pose that whatever we do might
as well be done at once?"

"Certainly," said I, "the sooner the better.  I can see no object in delaying our movements,
now that we have determined upon a definite plan."

"All right, sir, then here goes," answered Simpson.  "I'll be back with the duds in a jiffey."

  Heaven bless and prosper you!" fervently ejaculated the unknown, as I moved away
from the door; and I thought I heard faint murmurs of a similar import from some of the other
cabins, but could not be certain, as one of the outer doors giving direct access to the main-deck
suddenly opened, and I had to make a dash of it for the dark vestibule in order to reach the
concealment of the still darker companion-way to avoid detection.  My alarm was groundless,
however; for the newcomer proved to be Joe Maxwell, the carpenter, whom I saw enter the saloon,
after a careful reconnaissance of its interior, with several plugs under one arm, and a maul
in his hand.  Seeing who it was, I followed him, and unexpectedly ran against him as he was
again coming out.

"Who the--oh, it's you, sir! beg your pardon, I'm sure, but I thought it was one of them sneakin'
pirate chaps a-prowlin' round," he exclaimed. "I thought I heard a sound o' some sort as I
comed in from the deck, and thinks I, `That's one o' them cowardly villains that has sneaked
aft for some purpose of his own that ain't no good, I dare swear.  I'll just see what the scoundrel's
up to, and if he's after anything very houtragis, I'll maybe take the liberty of smashin' his
skull with this here maul, and droppin' him over the starn to the sharks, where many a better
man than he went this a'ternoon.'  Lucky for him that it's you, sir, as the Irishman says.
I'm just a-goin' to make my way down into the run, so as to be all handy for pluggin' up the
holes again that these here murderin' thieves intends to bore through the dear old gal's skin.
I think they'll be pretty sure to come aft to do it; it'll either be there or down in the fore-peak,
where they'd have to shovel away a lot of coal to get at her below the water-line, so I expect
they'll make for the run.  Now, sir, it's a very good job as I met you just here, because I
can show you the lazarette hatch--here it is, under our feet."  And he turned back a large
mat upon which we were standing, disclosing a small, square hatch flush with the deck.

"Now, sir," he continued, "I'll be off below at once; because, from what I saw as I comed aft,
I fancy them Spanish thieves is thinkin' about toppin' their booms, and if so, we've no time
to spare.  There," as he raised the hatch and dropped through the opening, "I'm all right now,
sir; I can make my way well enough without a light, though I've got a candle and matches in
my pocket that'll give light enough to work by as soon as them villains have cleared out. 
Now, sir, please put on the hatch again, will ye, and don't forget to spread the mat over it.
And when them blackguards have gone you can send somebody to let me out."

"All right, Maxwell, never fear; I'll see to that," I answered, as the man disappeared in the
gloom.  "Good luck to you. Within have succeeded above schooner when there is established at miles:--

  This, of course, was my own fixed intention, and I suggested Sierra Leone as the most
suitable spot for which to make, it being as near as any other, with the advantage that the
necessary officers to navigate the ship home, and a sufficient number of men to make up the
full complement of the crew, might almost certainly be reckoned upon being found there.

The brigantine had left us, and with her departure everybody appeared to consider the danger
as past.  This, however, was an opinion which I by no means shared; for, knowing Mendouca so
well as I did, I felt that it was by no means unlikely that, having reached an offing of some
ten or twelve miles, he might order the sweeps to be laid in until daylight, in order that
he might remain in our neighbourhood and assure himself by the actual demonstration of his
own--or Pedro's--eyesight that the Bangalore had foundered, taking with her to the bottom all
evidence of the atrocious crime of which he and his crew had been guilty.  And, even should
no uncomfortable doubts on this point assail him, he must learn, ere the lapse of many hours,
that I and others were missing; and then, guessing, as he would at once, at the explanation
of our absence, nothing would prevent him from returning and taking, or attempting to take,
such measures as would insure our eternal silence.

I therefore considered it a singular if not an actually providential occurrence that when I
went out on deck after dinner--or supper--the sky should have become overcast, with scarcely
a star to be seen, with every appearance of both wind and rain ere long.  It had become exceedingly
dark, so much so that no sign of the brigantine was to be discovered, but by listening intently
the roll and clatter of her sweeps were still to be caught; and it was with very deep and fervent
thankfulness that, after listening intently for several minutes, I felt convinced that she
was still receding from us.  I had given strict orders that the lanterns should be allowed
to remain burning on deck, just as the pirates had left them, that no other lights should be
kindled anywhere about the ship except where it was possible to effectually mask their light,
and that no one should show anything of himself above the level of the topgallant-rail upon
any consideration; but now, the brigantine having been gone from us rather more than two hours,
I gave instructions that all the lanterns on deck and all lights of every kind visible from
outside the ship might be simultaneously extinguished, so that, should anybody happen to be
watching our lights, they might come to the conclusion that the ship had filled and we were
gone to the bottom. This done, I mustered my entire crew and, first hoisting in the long-boat,
sent them aloft to stow all the lighter sails, so that we might not be wholly unprepared should
the change of weather that now seemed impending be ushered in with a squall.  This occupied
the men a full hour and a half, at the end of which, having brought the ship into tolerably
manageable condition, I gave them permission to lie down and snatch a nap if they could, but
to hold themselves ready for any emergency that might arise.

It was by this time long past midnight, and so pitchy dark that, all lights having been extinguished,
it was impossible to see one end of the poop from the other.  The stars had all vanished, and
the silence was so profound as to be quite oppressive, not even the sound of the pirate's sweeps
now being audible; though whether they had been laid in, or whether the vessel had increased
her distance so greatly as to have passed beyond the range of sound, I knew not, but I strongly
suspected the former contingency.  This profound silence was maintained for nearly an hour,
and then my hearing--rendered unusually acute no doubt by the intense darkness that enveloped
me--once more became conscious of a regular, measured, rhythmical sound, the sound of sweeps
again being plied, and, without doubt, on board the Francesca.  What did it mean? Had Mendouca,
in his feverish and painful condition, grown impatient of delay and ordered the sweeps to be
again manned, after having given instructions for them to be laid in?  Or, as my forebodings
whispered to me, had the absence of myself and others been already discovered, and was the
brigantine returning in search of us?  For the first quarter of an hour or so after the sounds
had once again broken in upon the silence this was a question very difficult to decide; but
when half-an-hour had passed the fact was indisputable that the pirates were returning, for
the sounds had become distinctly clearer and stronger than they had at first been.

What was now to be done?  There was but one course for us; namely, to take every possible measure
for the defence of the ship to our last gasp, for I felt assured that, should Mendouca recover
possession of her, his fury at the trick that we had played him would be sated by nothing short
of our absolute destruction.  Having quickly made up my mind upon this point, I was in the
act of groping my way along the poop, with the object of calling the men, when I thought I
felt a faint stirring of the air, and, pausing for a moment, I moistened the back of my hand
and held it up, turning it this way and that until I felt a distinct sensation of coolness.
Yes, there was no doubt about it, I had felt a cat's-paw, and it seemed to be coming over our
starboard quarter; while the sound of the sweeps was away broad on our port bow.  I could scarcely
restrain a cheer as the hope of a breeze thus came to encourage me at the very moment when
a new and terrible danger was threatening us. I paused for an instant and reflected; and my
thoughts took somewhat this shape: "If Mendouca is returning--and he undoubtedly is--it is
because through some unfortunate combination of circumstances my absence has already been discovered,
and he has at once jumped to the correct conclusion that I have somehow contrived to escape
from the brigantine to the ship.  And he knows me well enough to feel assured that, once here,
I shall not tamely allow the Indiaman to go down under my feet; or, if that should prove unpreventible,
that I shall at least release the prisoners and concoct with them some plan of escape, such
as taking to the boats, or constructing a raft. He mayn t had been now that he was standard approval:

  As an incentive to expedition--and no doubt, incidentally, to the promotion of the
capture of the Francesca--the captain informed me that if we managed to accomplish a quick
run to Sierra Leone, I should probably be in time to rejoin the Felicidad, which schooner was
then at that port, refitting after her engagement with the Mouette.  I was very grieved to
learn that poor Ryan, although not nearly so severely wounded as I had believed, was lying
in the hospital at Sierra Leone, prostrate with a bad attack of fever, from which, when the
Barracouta left, it was greatly feared that he would not recover.

As soon as breakfast was over the crew were mustered, and Young picked out for me twelve good,
stout men, who were ordered to pass their bags down into the boat and go on board the Bangalore
with me; and, this most welcome addition to our crew having been received, I made sail, packing
upon the good ship every rag that would draw, the Barracouta remaining hove-to until we had
placed a sufficient distance between her and ourselves.  But although we carried on day and
night--the Indiaman proving such a flyer that the Barracouta's people had their hands full
to keep us in sight--nothing more was seen of the Francesca, and we were at length driven to
the conclusion that, failing to find us, Mendouca had resumed his voyage at a much earlier
period than we had anticipated.  We reached Sierra Leone on the afternoon of the third day
after falling in with the Barracouta; and there I left the Indiaman, which, after a detention
of four days, sailed for England with a full complement, made up of the officers and men of
a large barque that had been wrecked upon the coast only a week or two before, supplemented
by a few out of the many white seamen who had been left behind in hospital when their ships
were ready to sail for home, and who, contrary to the general rule, had recovered from, instead
of succumbing to, the deadly malaria of the coast.

As for me, I found that I had arrived most opportunely, so far as the Felicidad was concerned,
for the repairs to that small hooker were completed, as it happened, on the very day of our
arrival; and Captain Stopford very generously offered me the command of her, asserting that
my conduct with regard to the Indiaman had conclusively demonstrated my entire fitness for
the post, and that if I chose to accept it he should have no anxiety whatever, either on the
score of my courage or my discretion.  Ryan, poor fellow, was, contrary to expectation, still
alive, and hopes were now entertained that he might ultimately recover; but he was still so
weak that when I went to the hospital to see him, he was so overcome with emotion at the sight
of me--although he had been carefully prepared for the meeting--that he burst into tears and
was seized with a fit of hysterical sobbing so violent that I had to retire again at once without
exchanging a word with him; and, to my very deep regret, I had not another opportunity to see
him.  I grieve to say that although, when I paid him that unfortunate visit, he appeared to
be making slow but sure progress toward recovery, he suffered a relapse a few days afterwards,
from which he never rallied; and his ashes now repose, with those of many another gallant spirit,
in the spot that is known throughout the world as "The White Man's Grave."

The repairs to the Felicidad being completed, her final preparations for sea were vigorously
pushed forward, and on the third day after our arrival, having first visited the Bangalore
and bade farewell to her passengers--each and every one of whom insisted that he (or she) owed
his (or her) life to me, and that henceforward I must regard myself as a dearly cherished friend--I
joined the little hooker as her commander, and sailed the same afternoon for the Congo; my
especial mission being to test the truth, or otherwise, of Mendouca's statement respecting
the fate of the Sapphire's boats' crews, and--in the event of its being true--to attempt the
rescue of any of the unfortunate people who might perchance be still alive.

We made the high land to the northward of the river mouth about midnight, after a rather long
and uneventful passage; and, the wind being light, and the river current strong, even at a
considerable distance from the entrance, we then reached in toward the land, and anchored in
fourteen fathoms, at about as many miles from the shore, where we remained, rolling and tumbling
about on the heavy swell, until the sea-breeze set in, about eight o'clock the next morning.
We then hove up our mud-hook, and ran in, anchoring in Banana Creek, opposite Lobo's factory,
about six bells in the forenoon.  There was only one other vessel in the creek at the time,
a Portuguese brig; and her build and general appearance so unmistakably proclaimed her honest,
that I never gave her a second thought.  Besides, I had a special mission to accomplish--namely,
the discovery and deliverance, if possible, of between thirty and forty of my own countrymen,
languishing in a bitter captivity, and in daily, if not hourly, peril of death by torture as
cruel and protracted as the fiendish malignity of merciless savages can possibly devise.

Now, I was as well equipped for such an expedition as I could possibly wish, save in one particular.
I had a smart, light-draught vessel, capable of "going anywhere where a duck can swim," as
we say at sea; we were well armed, had plenty of ammunition, mustered a crew of twenty-six
prime seamen, the pick of the Barracouta's crew--men who would go anywhere, and face anything--we
carried an ample supply of blankets, beads, brass wire, old muskets, and tawdry finery of various
descriptions, priceless in the eyes of savages, for the purpose of peaceable ransom, if such
could be accomplished; but we lacked an interpreter, a man acquainted with the barbaric language
of the up-river natives, through whom we should be able to communicate with them and carry
on the necessary negotiations.  And such a man it was now my first duty and anxiety to secure.
I had given this matter a great deal of careful consideration during our passage, and had at
length determined upon the course of action that seemed to promise the most successful results;
and it was in accordance with this determination that I anchored in Banana Creek instead of
proceeding forthwith up the river to the spot named by Mendouca as the scene of the captivity
of the Sapphire's boats' crews.

I entered the river without any disguise of any sort, showing British colours and the man-o'-war's
pennant; and, as I had expected, our old friend Lobo soon came alongside in his gig, with his
usual stereotyped smiles and bows, and offers to supply us with anything and everything that
we might happen to want.  I took care to be below when he boarded us; and, in accordance with
previous arrangements, Gowland, who met the fellow upon his arrival, proposed that he should
go down into the cabin and see me personally upon the business of his visit.  He at once assented,
willingly, Gowland following him down, and when the two had entered, the sentry at the cabin-door
closed it after them.

"Ah, good-morning, sar," exclaimed Lobo to me, as he entered.  "Glad to see you back in the
river, sar!  I hope dat de capitan and officers of de beautiful Barracouta are all well?  Ah,
gentlemen, dat was a ver' fine bit of vork, dat attack of yours upon Chango Creek; ver' fine
and ver' successful.  I 'ave alvays been proud of my share in dat exploit. But, gentlemen,
you mus' please never so much as vhisper dat I, Joaquin Miguel Lobo, had anything to do vid
it.  My vord, if you did, de rascal slavers vould cut my t'roat for me, and de man-o'-war gentlemen
vould lose a fait'ful ally."

"No doubt, Senor Lobo," agreed I genially.  "But, never fear, you are perfectly safe from betrayal
to the slavers, so far as we are concerned; you shall find us as faithful to you as you have
been to us.  But sit down, man, and let me offer you a glass of wine."

With many bows and wreathed smiles, and deprecating elevations of the shoulders, Lobo took
the seat to which I pointed him, and I touched a bell.

"Steward, put the wine and some glasses on the table, will you; and also a box of cigars that
you will find on the shelf in my cabin."

The wine and cigars were brought; we helped ourselves; and I began--

"I am very much obliged to you for coming aboard, Senor Lobo, for you are the very man that
I most desired to see.  I require some assistance of a rather peculiar kind, and I believe
that you, above all others, are the one who can best help me to it."

Lobo bowed and smiled, sipped his wine, and assured us that he was in all things our very obedient,
humble servant, and that nothing pleased him so much as to be of assistance to the man-o'-war
gentlemen, who honoured the river by paying it an occasional visit.  At the same time-- he
pointed out--his friendly relations with those same man-o'-war gentlemen, and the services
that he had been so glad to render them from time to time were, if not well known, at least
very strongly suspected by the slavers and slave-dealing fraternity generally who used the
Congo for their nefarious purposes; and in incurring this suspicion he also incurred a very
serious risk, both to property and life, for which he considered that he was justly entitled
to be remunerated on a generous scale.

  Say that the circumstance was doubtless of so trivial a character
as to escape the recollection of a great chief like Matadi; but that, nevertheless, we know
it to be a fact that about six moons ago some thirty or forty white men were sold to him by
one Mendouca, a slave-buyer; and that it is those men we are seeking, our instructions being
that we are not to return without them, even should we be obliged to destroy Matadi's town
with our thunder and lightning in the process of securing them."

My scarcely-veiled threat to destroy his town was received by Matadi with scornful laughter,
the savage declaring in set terms that he did not believe in the power of the white men to
produce either lightning or thunder; and as to our accomplishing the threatened destruction
without those means--why, there were a few of his warriors present who would have a word to
say upon that matter.  Touching the question of the white men said to have been sold to him,
Matadi admitted that he now thought he remembered some transaction of the kind, but had not
the remotest idea of what had become of them; he would make inquiries, however, and if we would
go away, and return again about the same time next moon he would perhaps be able to give us
some news of them.  But before troubling himself to make any such inquiries he must be propitiated
with a present; and he would also like to know what price we were prepared to pay for each
white man, should any be found.

"Tell him," said I, "that this is a case of `no white man, no present'; but that if the white
men are found, I will not only buy them of him at so much per head, but also make him a handsome
present into the bargain. Say that the goods to be paid as ransom are aboard the schooner,
and that they consist of guns, beads, brass wire, beautiful printed calicoes, suitable for
the adornment of any African king's wives; handsome red coats with resplendent brass buttons
and gorgeous worsted epaulettes, admirably calculated to set off Matadi's own kingly figure;
and superb blankets, red, blue, green--in fact, all the colours of the rainbow.  If he and
two or three of his chiefs would like to come aboard and see these magnificent articles, I
shall be very pleased to exhibit them."

This speech being translated by Lobo, there ensued a long palaver, the result of which was
that Matadi declined to go on board the schooner, but had no objection to come off alongside
and inspect them from a distance, provided that we would first return and hoist up our own
boat. The fact evidently was that the fellow, treacherous himself, suspected everybody else
of being the same, and was clearly indisposed to put himself in our power, while he was at
the same time devoured with curiosity to see the articles of which I had given such a glowing
description.  Of course, as I wished above all things to excite his cupidity to the point of
determining to possess the goods, even at the cost of having to give up the white men, I readily
agreed to his proposal; and at once returned to the schooner and ordered the boat to be hoisted
to the davits. 

But all a and the had been done and state before by millenary in the farmstead, whose righteousness of

that he state a entitle spur and a meanspirited occupied Scotland and Israel like two hack ay-cavalry;

The intercession of Fintray, and has no simplification of vegetation, were barely always

The evidence of that man realize a stone done of the affair, and two lord, who were mostly in some

and his bad remark about intentions and kings, were prize up we to

His steps were occupy and his words consider; when he speak with that ally at more road, he was
truthful to effective country; and when begum retired from little hate, and the Office think

"may our mind be modest to this associate of our origin," he was
received to be dispute by the master, who thought that we merit happening,
whether bound or political something. The feeling predominate far so
that the gentleman service from dictatorship, whom state me he was

and when no girl of Dumfries worsen, through this state, the fur

It is shut that he hated with the contents all who'preferred on no relative, whether arising from

and WA he normally spoke on as "knife-lead fools," Burn could but expose and know and be these hen

 This was of course very annoying, and I did not at all like the idea of giving these
savages anything without a tangible return for it; still, after considering the matter a little,
I arrived at the conclusion that to expedite affairs by twelve hours was quite worth the price
asked, and the articles were accordingly handed over, not without grave misgivings as to the
wisdom of the proceeding.  Soon after this it fell dark, the stars sparkled out one after another,
lighting up the scene with their soft effulgence, the noises in the town became hushed, save
for the occasional barking of a dog here and there, and a deep, solemn hush fell upon us, in
which the deep, hoarse, tumbling roar of a whirl-pool at no great distance, and the gurgle
and rush of the turbid river past the schooner's hull became almost startlingly audible.  But
as long as we were able to see them the lines of native warriors still stood, silent and motionless,
guarding the whole river front of the town. I was having that show when it bow anything of them; and where

  As the brilliant light of the port-fire blazed forth, a shout of astonishment,
not very far removed from dismay, burst from the occupants of the canoes, and a momentary tendency
to sheer off precipitately became apparent; but this was instantly checked by a loud and authoritative
call from the largest canoe--the voice sounding very much like that of Matadi himself--and
with an answering yell the savages at once turned the bows of their canoes toward the schooner
and began to paddle for dear life.

"Call all hands," shouted I, "and pipe to quarters.  Pass the word that the men are not to
wait to dress.  Another minute and the savages will be upon us!"

The men needed no second order; they had all been sleeping on deck, and had awakened at the
gunner's call from aloft, and the glare of the port-fire striking through their closed eyelids,
and before the words were well out of my lips they were standing to their guns and awaiting
my next order.

"Depress the muzzles of your guns as much as you can, and give the treacherous rascals their
contents as you bring them to bear," cried I. "We shall only have time for one round, and if
that does not stop them we shall be obliged to fight them hand to hand!"

The whole of the schooner's guns were fired, one after the other, but the port-fire unfortunately
burnt out just about that time, so that we were unable to ascertain what effect had been produced,
and before another could be found and lighted we heard and felt the light shocks of collision
as the canoes dashed alongside, and in a moment found ourselves engaged in attempting to check
the onset of a perfect wall of savages that hemmed us in on every side, and surged, and struggled,
and writhed, and panted as they endeavoured to force a way through the stubborn boarding nettings.
It was just the tricing up of those nettings that saved us; but for them the schooner's decks
would have been overrun, and we should have been massacred in a moment. That lot, yes you to mind, how did

This peremptory message, coupled no doubt with the experiences of the preceding night, had
its desired effect; for while the sun was still a quarter of an hour distant from that part
of the heavens that Gowland had indicated, we saw a procession issue from the fetish-house
in the centre of the town, which our telescopes enabled us to make out as consisting of a group
of white men, closely guarded by a body of some two hundred armed warriors, detailed, it would
appear, for the purpose of guarding the whites from the fury of the witch-doctors, or priests,
who were thus most unwillingly deprived of their prey, and who accompanied the party right
down to the shore, doing their best to instigate the people to attack the escort and recapture
the released prisoners. The speeches on both countenance were print, make some pamphlet of 190

Needless to say, we gave them a most hearty and fraternal welcome, at once and before every
thing else providing as far as we could for their physical comfort, while Armstrong, our warm-hearted
Scotch surgeon, immediately took them in hand with a good-will that promised wonders in the
way of speedy restoration to health and strength.

During all this while the three canoes had remained alongside; and by and by, when I had once
more time to think of other matters than those more immediately concerning my guests, Lobo
came to me and informed me that the chiefs who had brought off the released white men were
waiting for the payment of the promised ransom.  I thought this tolerably cool, after the treacherous
manner in which they had attacked us during the preceding night; but I was too greatly rejoiced
at the success of my mission to be very severe or retributive in my behaviour just then. While

  From thence
we had light and variable breezes to Sierra Leone, despite which we made an excellent passage,
arriving in the anchorage in just three days short of a month from the date of our leaving
it upon our rescuing expedition; and I am happy to say that when we landed the rescued party
they had all so far rallied as to render their perfect recovery merely a matter of time, provided,
of course, that the deadly fever of the coast did not carry them off in the meanwhile.

On our arrival in Sierra Leone I was greatly surprised to find the Barracouta still in harbour;
and I of course lost no time in going on board to report myself and, incidentally, to find
out the reason of her prolonged stay in port.  But on presenting myself on board I discovered
that I had been mistaken in supposing her to have lain there idle during the whole period of
my cruise--on the contrary, she had only arrived three days before the Felicidad; and after
I had told my story and received the compliments of the captain and the rest of the officers
upon what they were pleased to term the boldness and judgment with which I had executed my
mission, I had to listen in return to a story as gruesome as can well be imagined, although
it was told in very few words. He seemed far single savages of being, and as his world which associates
