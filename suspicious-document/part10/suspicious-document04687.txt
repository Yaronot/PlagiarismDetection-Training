Throughout the day advances were made and the works so long besieged were occupied all over
the vast field, and at night the men "lay down in muddy trenches, among the dying and the dead,
under a most murderous fire of sharpshooters. There had been charges and counter charges,--but
our troops held all they had gained. At length the hot day gave place to chilly night, and
the extreme change brought much suffering. The men had flung away whatever was fling-away-able
during the charge of the morning and the subsequent hot march--as men always will, under like
circumstances--and now they found themselves blanketless, stockingless, overcoatless,--in cold
and damp trenches, and compelled by the steady firing to lie still, or adopt a horizontal,
crawling mode of locomotion, which did not admit of speed enough to quicken the circulation
of the blood. Some took clothing from the dead and wrapped themselves in it; others, who were
fortunate enough to procure spades, dug gopher holes, and burrowed. At daylight the Sixty-fifth
New York clambered over the huge earthwork, took possession of Fort Hell, opened a picket fire
and fired one of the guns in the fort, eliciting no reply. Just then a huge fire in the direction
of the city, followed by several explosions, convinced our side that Lee's army had indeed
left. The regiment was hastily got together,--ninety muskets being all that could be produced,--and
sent out on picket. The picket line advanced and meeting with no resistance pushed on into
the city. What regiment was first to enter the city is and probably ever will be a disputed
question. The Second Connecticut claims to have been in first, but Colonel Hubbard had ordered
the colors to remain behind when the regiment went out on the skirmish line, consequently the
stars and stripes that first floated over captured Petersburg belonged to some other regiment.
Colonel Hubbard was, however, made Provost-Marshal of the city, and for a brief while dispensed
government and law in that capacity."

Petersburg, however, now that it was abandoned by the enemy, had lost the importance it had
so long possessed, and all energies were given to preventing the escape of its late defenders.
Before the end of the day (April 3rd) the regiment, with the rest of the Sixth Corps, had turned
westward and joined the pursuit. The chase was stern and the marches rapid, but far less wearing
to these victorious veterans, filled with the consciousness of success, than those that had
initiated their campaigning less than a year before. On April 6th the regiment, after an all
day march, came up with the enemy in position at Sailor's Creek, and went into the last engagement
of its career. It was a charge under a hot fire, sharp and decisive, which quickly changed
to a pursuit of the fleeing enemy, kept up until the bivouack at ten o'clock. The Second Connecticut
captured the headquarters train of General Mahone, a battle flag, and many prisoners, and ended
the tale of its losses with three men killed and six wounded.

The chase was taken up next morning (April 7th), and the regiment had reached a point close
to Appomattox Court House, when on April 9th Lee met Grant and surrendered what remained of
his army, at that historic place.

       *       *       *       *       *

To imagine all that this meant to the men in arms is far easier than to attempt its description.
They saw at last the end arriving of all the privation and suffering they had volunteered to
undergo; they saw the triumph of the Union they had risen to defend to the uttermost extremity
a proven fact. The whole continent vibrated with the deepest feeling at the news of it, but
they, better than any others, knew in the fullest degree its immense significance.

Immediately after the surrender of the Army of Northern Virginia, the Sixth Corps was moved
to Burkesville, some distance from Appomattox in the direction of Richmond, and there it remained
for about ten days awaiting events. On April 22nd it was ordered southward to Danville, with
a view to joining Sherman's army then confronting Johnston in North Carolina, a movement which
again necessitated some fatiguing marches, the one hundred and five miles being covered in
less than five days. News was received, however, that Johnston had followed the example of
Lee and surrendered, and the corps thereupon faced about once more. On its leisurely progress
to the north it was joined by crowds of the newly freed negroes, who attached themselves to
every regiment in droves, and the lately hostile inhabitants came also at every stopping place,
"with baskets and two-wheeled carts" for supplies to relieve their dire necessities.

Near Richmond the regiment remained several days, and the men were allowed passes to visit
the late Confederate capital, so long the goal of their strenuous efforts. "The burnt district
was still smoking with the remains of the great fire of April 2nd, and the city was full of
officers and soldiers of the ex-Confederate army. The blue and the gray mingled on the streets
and public squares, and were seen side by side in the Sabbath congregations. The war was over."

The consciousness of this last great fact was now becoming insistent in the minds of these
citizen soldiers. The great purpose for which they had offered themselves was carried out,
and their eagerness to have done with all the circumstances of military life was increasingly
strong, and grew so intense as to render the final weeks of their term of service extremely trying.

The tremendous task of disbanding the armies of the Union was occupying the entire energies
of the War Department, but to the men it seemed as if their longed for turn would never come.
Back in the well-known fortifications around Washington they waited, taking part in the Grand
Review on June 8th, in all the misery of full dress, and in a temper that would have carried
them against the thousands of acclaiming spectators with savage joy, had it been a host of
enemies in arms.

But their turn came at last, and on July 7th, one hundred and eighty-three men, all that were
left of the original enlisted men of the "old Nineteenth," were mustered out; two days later
they departed for New Haven and were welcomed there, like all the returning troops, with patriotic
rejoicing.

The remainder of the regiment, some four hundred in number, was mustered out in its turn on
August 18th, reached New Haven on the 20th, and "passed up Chapel Street amid welcoming crowds
of people, the clangor of bells, and a shower of rockets and red lights that made the field-and-staff
horses prance with the belief that battle had come again. After partaking of a bounteous entertainment
prepared in the basement of the State House, the regiment proceeded to Grapevine Point, where,
on the 5th of September, they received their pay and discharge, and the Second Connecticut
Heavy Artillery vanished from sight and passed into History."

       *       *       *       *       *

In Litchfield County the return of the various contingents to their homes was made the occasion
of great rejoicing. Chief among these celebrations was a grand reception at the county seat
on August 1st, when the first detachment to be discharged had arrived; they were fêted with
dinner and speeches, illuminations and a triumphal arch. There were also other organized demonstrations
in other towns, and everywhere the strongest manifestations of pride in these warrior sons
of the county, and joy at their return.

But all who went had not returned. The terrible significance of the cold and formal columns
and tables of the regiment's casualties was felt in every town, and to their tale was added
in succeeding years a long list of the many who had indeed come back, but broken with wounds
and disease, and just as truly devoted to death through their service as those who fell upon
the field of battle.

What the Second Connecticut suffered is shown, so far as official statistics go, in the tables
published by the Adjutant-General of the state, as follows:

    Killed                               147
    Missing in action, probably killed    11
    Fatally wounded                       95
    Wounded                              427
    Captured                              72
    Died in prison                        21
    Died of disease or accident          154
    Discharged for disability            285
    Unaccounted for at muster out         35

The officers of the regiment as mustered out were: Colonel, James Hubbard, Salisbury; lieutenant-colonel,
Jeffrey Skinner, Winchester; majors, Edward W. Jones, New Hartford; Augustus H. Fenn, Plymouth;
Chester D. Cleveland, Barkhamsted; adjutant, Theodore F. Vaill, Litchfield; quartermaster,
Edward C. Huxley, Goshen; surgeon, Henry Plumb, New Milford; assistant surgeons, Robert G.
Hazzard, New Haven; Judson B. Andrews, New Haven; chaplain, Winthrop H. Phelps, Barkhamsted.

 A number
of the officers and men were college graduates when they enlisted, and others gained degrees
after the war ended; the list which follows is, however, necessarily incomplete; in fact, an
absolutely correct list is no doubt hopelessly impossible.

Major James Q. Rice, who was killed at Winchester, was a member of the class of 1850 at Wesleyan,
and received from that institution the degree of Master of Arts in 1855. At the time of the
regiment's formation he was conducting an academy in Goshen, and was enlisted as captain of
a company which he had been active in recruiting.

Lieutenant-Colonel Nathaniel Smith of Woodbury entered the Yale Law School in the class of
1853, but did not graduate. Ill health forced him to relinquish his commission early in 1864,
and until his death in 1877 he was a leading citizen of the county.

Judge Augustus H. Fenn, Major and Brevet-Colonel, came back from the war, having lost an arm
at Cedar Creek, to take a course in the Law School at Harvard, and Yale made him a Master of
Arts in 1889. His prominence for many years in public life and as judge in the highest courts
in the state is well known. At the time of his death in 1897, he was a lecturer in the Yale
Law School, and member of the Supreme Court of Errors.

Rev. James Deane, Captain and Brevet-Major, was a graduate of Williams in the class of 1857.
He was pastor of the Congregational church at East Canaan when the regiment was organized,
and was one of its recruiting officers.

Adjutant Theodore F. Vaill, the historian of the regiment, was a student before the war at
Union College, but did not graduate.

Captain George S. Williams, of New Milford, was a member of the class of 1852 at Yale for a
time, and received a degree from Trinity in 1855.

Surgeon Henry Plumb, and Assistant-Surgeons Robert G. Hazzard and John W. Lawton were all graduates
of the Yale Medical School, in the classes of 1861, 1862, and 1859. Assistant-Surgeon Judson
B. Andrews graduated at Yale in 1855. He was captain in a New York regiment in the early part
of the war, and became afterward superintendent of the Buffalo State Hospital, and a recognized
authority on insanity before his death in 1894.

Chaplain Jonathan A. Wainwright graduated at the University of Vermont in 1846, and after the
war was for some years rector of St. John's Church in Salisbury. He was later connected with
a church college in Missouri, where he died in 1898.

Captain William H. Lewis, Jr., studied after the war at the Berkeley Divinity School, and has
been for many years rector of St. John's Church in Bridgeport.

Lieutenant and Brevet-Captain Lewis W. Munger, graduating at Brown in 1869 and later from the
Crozier Theological Seminary, entered the ministry of the Baptist church.

Corporal Francis J. Young entered the Yale Medical School before the war, and returned after
its close to take his degree in 1866.

Hospital Steward James J. Averill also graduated at the Yale Medical School after the war.

Sergeant Theodore C. Glazier was a graduate of Trinity in the class of 1860, and was a tutor
there when he enlisted. He was later made colonel of a colored regiment, and served with credit
in that capacity.

Corporal Edward C. Hopson, a graduate of Trinity in 1864, was killed at Cedar Creek.

Sergeant Garwood R. Merwin, who had been a member of the class of 1864 at Yale, died at Alexandria
in 1863.

Sergeant Romulus C. Loveridge, who had been entered in the class of 1865 at Yale, received
a commission in a colored regiment.

Colonel Mackenzie graduated at West Point in 1862, but he was never a resident of the county,
or of Connecticut, and his only connection with either was through his commission from Governor
Buckingham.

There are not a few other names upon the rolls of the regiment which upon more thorough investigation
than has been possible in the present case would certainly be added to the list. A complete
history of the organization would also give a large place to the association of its veterans
formed shortly after the war, whose frequent gatherings have more than a superficial likeness
to the reunions of college classes. Memorable among these meetings was the one held on October
21, 1896, the occasion being the dedication of the regiment's monument in the National Cemetery
at Arlington, with a pilgrimage also to the scenes of its battles and marches in the Shenandoah
Valley near by.

As a whole, the regiment was a body thoroughly representative not only of the army of which
it was a fraction, an army as has been often said unlike any other the world has known, but
also of the population from which it was drawn. Fasting, and firing, and sickness in decease were,
perhaps, same experience compared with those which'burd Helen'come as, through they are described
unto the Prof Child keep, not without occasion, to have'nevertheless take no tame'in our own
or any superior organ. Though the large addition to its numbers which the increase
in size necessitated made it perhaps somewhat less homogeneous than at first, it did not greatly
alter its essential characteristics.

The records kept by the association referred to, furnish suggestive revelations as to the various
elements that composed it. The names of men of every sort and kind are found upon the rolls.
There were veterans of the Mexican War; there were refugees from the revolutionary uprisings
in Europe of 1848; there were some who had served under compulsion in the armies of the South;
there were men whose obviously fictitious names concealed stories which could be guessed to
be extraordinary; there were names which have been for years among the best known and most
honored in this state; and there were those of outcasts and wrecks.

A large part of these men came back after their service ended to resume the peaceful life of
citizenship, and every town among us has known some of them ever since among its leading figures,
while some in quarters far distant have also attained to honors and responsibilities, as the
records show. Connecticut has known for many years no small number of them as foremost in all
lines of activity, and knows to-day, in official station and in private life, men of many honors,
who count not least among these the fact that they were enrolled among the soldiers of the
Second Connecticut Heavy Artillery.
