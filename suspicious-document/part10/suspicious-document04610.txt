When he came back, the mails and luggage had been got on board. The water began to seethe and
foam away from the paddle-wheels, and, with a pleasant hoot, the boat steamed away. And then,
as Morgan leaned against the side, he fell a-musing on many things, all woven in a web of wonder
at his happiness. Different parts of his life flashed at him, all out of order and irrelevantly.
How near, too, had he just passed to the Ketterings! Cleo's father rose before him again with
his greying hair and his good face, bent, aproned, and in corduroys, just as he was wont to
stand in the Dover workshop. He remembered the kindly invitation the old man had given him
when they parted, and he felt touched as he now called to mind the letter he had received from
him on his ceasing to be his son-in-law. "I am glad to know you are free from her, and hope
you won't think me an unnatural father; but she never tried to win my affections, whereas you
won them without trying. I do hope that at no distant day you will marry a true lady, who will
make up to you for the past. I know what you must have suffered."

He had been concerned about Cleo, and had so overflowed with pity for her that he had scarce
had the strength to take the step that had made his happiness possible. But he knew that she
was quite well and happy, living at the same house where he had first seen her, and that it
had been perfectly indifferent to her whether she were tied to him or not.

And now his old fancy came to him again that he could trace a distinct unity in his life, as
though it had been moulded by a guiding Power. As Helen had said, the inner spring of his life
had been its own good fairy.

And as he looked at Margaret again, the dream that had sometimes come to him did not now seem
so unrealisable as it had in the old days when he had been cut off from her. The burning of
his old manuscripts had marked his sense that his ambition was utterly dead. But he had never
regretted the burning. And now he even rejoiced at it. For, by toil and discipline and facing
the fulness of the living world, he had attained to a clear sanity, to a just sense of values;
the romantic blur of his early poetic vision clarifying into the strong definiteness of the
Real. Assuredly he could now no longer write those nebulous, elusive word-harmonies. Nor for
him the mere æsthetic toying, the dainty piece of colour-work; but poetry that should throb
with vitality and humanness. From dream poetry he had passed to dream life. Now that he had
won his way to true life, was he not, too, to win his way to true song?

To be a voice whose enchantment should echo down the ages, whose never-dying melody should
accompany the generations on their toilsome way, ever fresh, ever sweet for human hearts!

So did he dare to aspire again, and in his fancy it was Margaret's spirit that floated on and
on for ever, her fragrance immanent in the songs he should sing!

The sea was radiant with sunlight. A soft wind breathed in his face. The dwindling town nestled
lazily in its valley, and the line of white cliffs stretched on either hand. And as Margaret's
voice spoke to him again, something of her sweetness seemed to rise and rest on the spring world.

THE END.

  Mary J. Holmes' Novels.

  "Mrs. Fleming's stories are growing more and more popular every day.
  Their delineations of character, lifelike conversations, flashes of
  wit, constantly varying scenes, and deeply interesting plots, combine
  to place their author in the very first rank of Modern Novelists."

  "Who has not read with rare delight the novels of Augusta Evans? Her
  strange, wonderful, and fascinating style; the profound depths to
  which she sinks the probe into human nature, touching its most sacred
  chords and springs; the intense interest thrown around her characters,
  and the very marked peculiarities of her principal figures, conspire
  to give an unusual interest to the works of this eminent Southern
  authoress." 8vo., Magnificently Illustrated
   with 30 Photogravure and Half-tone Engravings. Per set, $6.00.

  Julie P. Smith's Novels.

  "The novels by this author are of unusual merit, uncommonly well
  written, clever and characterized by great wit and vivacity. They are
  growing popular and more popular every day."

  "The Novels of Marion Harland are of surpassing excellence. By
  intrinsic power of character-drawing and descriptive facility, they
  hold the reader's attention with the most intense interest and
  fascination."

  New Cloth Bound Editions.

  "There is a great difference between the productions of Albert Ross
  and those of some of the sensational writers of recent date. When he
  depicts vice he does it with an artistic touch, but he never makes it
  attractive. Mr. Ross' dramatic instincts are strong. His characters
  become in his hands living, moving creatures."

  John Esten Cooke's Works.

  "The thrilling historic stories of John Esten Cooke must be classed
  among the BEST and most POPULAR of all American writers. The great
  contest between the States was the theme he chose for his Historic
  Romances. Following until the close of the war the fortunes of Stuart,
  Ashby, Jackson, and Lee, he returned to "Eagle's Nest," his old home,
  where, in the quiet of peace, he wrote volume after volume, intense in
  dramatic interest."

  "There is no writer of the present day who excels A. S. Roe, in his
  particular line of fiction. He is distinguished by his fidelity to
  nature, his freedom from affectation, his sympathy with the interests
  of everyday existence and his depth and sincerity of feeling. His
  stories appeal to the heart and strengthen and refresh it."

  "Bertha Clay is one of the most popular writers of fiction. Her
  romances are truly wonderful creations. They win the admiration of the
  masses and will continue to increase in popularity."

  "These stories have charmed thousands of readers, and they hold a
  place, so far as popularity goes, in the very front rank of American
  fiction."

  "Miss Gardner's works are becoming more and more popular every year,
  and they will continue to be popular long after many of our present
  favorite writers are forgotten."
