"I propose," said Louis, "retreating, bag and baggage, to the nearest point of Long Island."

"My French cousin has well spoken," said Hector, mimicking the Indian mode of speaking; "but
listen to the words of the wise. I propose to take all our household stores that are of the
most value to the island, and lodge the rest safely in our new root-house, first removing from
its neighbourhood all such light, loose matter as is likely to take fire. The earthen roof
will save it from destruction. As to the shanty, it must take its chance to stand or fall."

"The fence of the little clearing will be burned, no doubt. Well, never mind; better that than
our precious selves. And the corn, fortunately, is not yet sown," said Louis.

Hector's advice met with general approval, and the girls soon set to work to secure the property
they meant to leave.

It was a fortunate thing that the root-house had been finished, as it formed a secure store-house
for their goods, and could also be made available as a hiding-place from the Indians, in time
of need. The boys carefully scraped away all the combustible matter from its vicinity and that
of the house; but the rapid increase of the fire now warned them to hurry down to join Catharine
and the young Mohawk, who had gone off to the lake shore with such things as they required
to take with them.

CHAPTER XI.

  "I know a lake where the cool waves break
     And softly fall on the silver sand;
   And no stranger intrudes on that solitude,
     And no voices but ours disturb the strand."

  Irish Song

The breeze had sprung up, and had already brought the fire down as far as the creek. The swamp
had long been on fire; and now the flames were leaping among the decayed timbers, roaring and
crackling among the pines, and rushing to the tops of the cedars, springing from heap to heap
of the fallen branches, and filling the air with dense volumes of black and suffocating smoke.
So quickly did the flames advance that Hector and Louis had only time to push off the canoe
before the heights along the shore were wrapped in smoke and fire. Many a giant oak and noble
pine fell crashing to the earth, sending up showers of red sparks as its burning trunk shivered
in its fall. Glad to escape from the suffocating vapour, the boys quickly paddled out to the
island, enjoying the cool, fresh air of the lake. Reposing on the grass beneath the trees,
they passed the day sheltered from the noonday sun, and watched the progress of the fire upon
the shore. At night the girls slept securely under the canoe, which they raised on one side
by means of forked sticks stuck in the ground.

It was a grand sight to see the burning Plains at night reflected on the water. A thousand
flaming torches flickered upon its still surface, to which the glare of a gas-lighted city
would have been dim and dull by contrast.

Louis and Hector would speculate on the probable chances of the shanty escaping from the fire,
and of the fence remaining untouched. Of the safety of the root-house they entertained no fear,
as the grass was already springing green on the earthen roof; and, below they had taken every
precaution to secure its safety, by scraping up the earth near it. [Footnote: Many a crop of
grain and comfortable homestead has been saved by turning a furrow round the field; and great
conflagrations have been effectually stopped by men beating the fire out with spades, and hoeing
up the fresh earth so as to cut off all communication with the dry roots, grass, and leaves
that feed its onward progress. Water, even could it be got, which is often impossible, is not
nearly so effectual in stopping the progress of fire; even women and little children can assist
in such emergencies.]

Catharine lamented for the lovely spring-flowers that would be destroyed by the fire.

"We shall have neither huckleberries nor strawberries this summer," she said mournfully; "and
the pretty roses and bushes will be scorched, and the ground black and dreary."

"The fire passes so rapidly over that it does not destroy many of the forest trees, only the
dead ones are destroyed; and that, you know, leaves more space for the living ones to grow
and thrive in," said Hector. "I have seen the year after a fire has run in the bush, a new
and fresh set of plants spring up, and even some that looked withered recover; the earth is
renewed and manured by the ashes, and it is not so great a misfortune as it at first appears."

"But how black and dismal the burned pine-woods look for years!" said Louis; "I do not think
there is a more melancholy sight in life than one of those burned pine-woods. There it stands,
year after year, with the black, branchless trees pointing up to the blue sky, as if crying
for vengeance against those that kindled the fire."

"They do, indeed, look ugly," said Catharine, "yet the girdled ones look very nearly as ill."
[Footnote: The girdled pines are killed by barking them round, to facilitate the clearing.]

At the end of two days the fire had ceased to rage, though the dim smoke-wreaths to the westward
showed where the work of destruction was still going on.

As there was no appearance of any Indians on the lake, nor yet at the point (Anderson's Point,
as it is now called) on the other side, they concluded the fire had possibly originated by
accident,--some casual hunter or trapper having left his camp-fire unextinguished; but as they
were not very likely to come across the scene of the conflagration, they decided on returning
back to their old home without delay. It was with some feeling of anxiety that they hastened
to see what evil had befallen their shanty.

"The shanty is burned!" was the simultaneous exclamation of both Louis and Hector, as they
reached the rising ground that should have commanded a view of its roof. "It is well for us
that we secured our things in the root-house," said Hector.

"Well, if that is safe, who cares? we can soon build up a new house, larger and better than
the old one," said Louis. "The chief part of our fence is gone, too, I see; but that, we can
renew at our leisure; no hurry, if we get it done a month hence, say I.--Come, ma belle, do
not look so sorrowful. There is our little squaw will help us to set up a capital wigwam while
the new house is building."

"But the nice table that you made, Louis, and the benches and shelves!"

"Never mind, Cathy; we will have better tables, and benches, and shelves too. Never fear, ma
chere; the same industrious Louis will make things comfortable. I am not sorry the old shanty
is down; we shall have a famous one put up, twice as large, for the winter. After the corn
is planted we shall have nothing else to do but to think about it."

The next two or three days were spent in erecting a wigwam, with poles and birch bark; and
as the weather was warm and pleasant, they did not feel the inconvenience so much as they would
have done had it been earlier in the season. The root-house formed an excellent store-house
and pantry; and Indiana contrived, in putting up the wigwam, to leave certain loose folds between
the birch-bark lining and outer covering, which formed a series of pouches or bags, in which
many articles could be stowed away out of sight. [Footnote: In this way the winter wigwams
of the Indians are constructed so as to give plenty of stowing room for all their little household
matters, materials for work, &c.]

While the girls were busy contriving the arrangements of the wigwam, the two boys were not
idle. The time was come for planting the corn; a succession of heavy thunder-showers had soaked
and softened the scorched earth, and rendered the labour of moving it much easier than they
had anticipated. They had cut for themselves wooden trowels, with which they raised the hills
for the seed. The corn planted, they next turned their attention to cutting house-logs; those
which they had prepared had been burned up, so they had their labour to begin again.

The two girls proved good helps at the raising; and in the course of a few weeks they had the
comfort of seeing a more commodious dwelling than the former one put up. The finishing of this,
with weeding the Indian corn, renewing the fence, and fishing, and trapping, and shooting partridges
and ducks and pigeons, fully occupied their time this summer. The fruit season was less abundant
this year than the previous one. The fire had done this mischief, and they had to go far a-field
to collect fruits during the summer months.

It so happened that Indiana had gone out early one morning with the boys, and Catharine was
alone. She had gone down to the spring for water, and on her return, was surprised at the sight
of a squaw and her family of three half-grown lad, and an innocent little brown papoose. [Footnote:
An Indian baby, but "papoose" is not an Indian word. It is probably derived from the Indian
imitation of the word "babies."] In their turn the strangers seemed equally astonished at Catharine's
appearance. The smiling aspect and good-natured laugh of the female, however, soon reassured
the frightened girl, and she gladly gave her the water which she had in her birch dish, on
her signifying her desire for drink. To this Catharine added some berries and dried venison,
and a bit of maple sugar, which was received with grateful looks by the boys; she patted the
brown baby, and was glad when the mother released it from its wooden cradle, and fed and nursed
it. The squaw seemed to notice the difference between the colour of her young hostess's fair
skin and her own swarthy hue; for she often took her hand, stripped up the sleeve of her dress,
and compared her arm with her own, uttering exclamations of astonishment and curiosity: possibly
Catharine was the first of a fair-skinned race this poor savage had ever seen. After her meal
was finished, she set the birchen dish on the floor, and restrapping the papoose in its cradle
prison, she slipped the basswood-bark rope over her forehead, and silently signing to her sons
to follow her, she departed. That evening a pair of ducks were found fastened to the wooden
latch of the door, a silent offering of gratitude for the refreshment that had been afforded
to this Indian woman and her children.

Indiana thought, from Catharine's description, that these were Indians with whom she was acquainted;
she spent some days in watching the lake and the ravine, lest a larger and more formidable
party should be near. The squaw, she said, was a widow, and went by the name of Mother Snowstorm,
from having been lost in the woods, when a little child, during a heavy storm of snow, and
nearly starved to death. She was a gentle, kind woman, and, she believed, would not do any
of them hurt. Her sons were good hunters, and, though so young, helped to support their mother,
and were very good to her and the little one.

I must now pass over a considerable interval of time, with merely a brief notice that the crop
of corn was carefully harvested, and proved abundant, and a source of great comfort. The rice
was gathered and stored, and plenty of game and fish laid by, with an additional store of honey.

The Indians, for some reason, did not pay their accustomed visit to the lake this season. Indiana
said they might be engaged with war among some hostile tribes, or had gone to other hunting-grounds.
The winter was unusually mild, and it was long before it set in. Yet the spring following was
tardy, and later than usual. It was the latter end of May before vegetation had made any very
decided progress.

The little log-house presented a neat and comfortable appearance, both within and without.
Indiana had woven a handsome mat of bass bark for the floor; Louis and Hector had furnished
it with seats and a table, rough, but still very respectably constructed, considering their
only tools were a tomahawk, a knife, and wooden wedges for splitting the wood into slabs. These
Louis afterwards smoothed with great care and patience. Their bedsteads were furnished with
thick, soft mats, woven by Indiana and Catharine from rushes which they cut and dried; but
the little squaw herself preferred lying on a mat or deerskin on the floor before the fire,
as she had been accustomed.

A new field had been enclosed, and a fresh crop of corn planted, which was now green and flourishing.
Peace and happiness dwelt within the log-house; but for the regrets that ever attended the
remembrance of all they had left and lost, no cloud would have dimmed the serenity of those
who dwelt beneath its humble roof.

 See, now, there is neither
catamount nor weasel here to seize thee, silly one;" and as she spoke, she raised her head
and flung back the thick clusters of soft fair hair that shaded her eyes. The deadly glare
of a pair of dark eyes fixed upon her met her terrified gaze, gleaming with sullen ferocity
from the angle of the door-post, whence the upper part of the face alone was visible, partly
concealed by a mat of tangled, shaggy black hair. Paralyzed with fear, the poor girl neither
spoke nor moved; she uttered no cry; but pressing her hands tightly across her breast, as if
to still the loud beating of her heart, she sat gazing upon that fearful appearance, while,
with stealthy step, the savage advanced from his lurking-place, keeping, as he did so, his
eyes riveted upon hers, with such a gaze as the wily serpent is said to fascinate its prey.
His hapless victim moved not:--whither could she flee to escape one whose fleet foot could
so easily have overtaken her in the race? where conceal herself from him whose wary eye fixed
upon her seemed to deprive her of all vital energy?

Uttering that singular, expressive guttural which seems with the Indian to answer the purpose
of every other exclamation, he advanced, and taking the girl's ice-cold hands in his, tightly
bound them with a thong of deer-hide, and led her unresistingly away. By a circuitous path
through the ravine they reached the foot of the mount, where lay a birch canoe, rocking gently
on the waters, in which a middle-aged female and a young girl were seated. The females asked
no questions, and expressed no word indicative of curiosity or surprise, as the strong arm
of the Indian lifted his captive into the canoe, and made signs to the elder squaw to push
from the shore. When all had taken their places, the woman, catching up a paddle from the bottom
of the little vessel, stood up, and with a few rapid strokes sent it skimming over the lake.

The miserable captive, overpowered with the sense of her calamitous situation, bowed down her
head upon her knees, and concealing her agitated face in her garments, wept in silent agony.
Visions of horror presented themselves to her bewildered brain; all that Indiana had described
of the cruelty of this vindictive race came vividly before her mind. Poor child, what miserable
thoughts were thine during that brief voyage!

Had the Indians also captured her friends? or was she alone to be the victim of their vengeance?
What would be the feelings of those beloved ones on returning to their home and finding it
desolate! Was there no hope of release? As these ideas chased each other through her agitated
mind, she raised her eyes, all streaming with tears, to the faces of the Indian and his companions
with so piteous a look that any heart but the stoical one of an Indian would have softened
at its sad appeal; but no answering glance of sympathy met hers, no eye gave back its silent
look of pity--not a nerve or a muscle moved the cold, apathetic features of the Indians; and
the woe-stricken girl again resumed her melancholy attitude, burying her face in her heaving
bosom to hide its bitter emotions from the heartless strangers.

She was not fully aware that it is part of the Indian's education to hide the inward feelings
of the heart, to check all those soft and tender emotions which distinguish the civilized man
from the savage.

It does indeed need the softening influence of that powerful Spirit, which was shed abroad
into the world to turn the hearts of the disobedient to the wisdom of the just, to break down
the strongholds of unrighteousness, and to teach man that he is by nature the child of wrath
and victim of sin, and that in his unregenerated nature his whole mind is at enmity with God
and his fellow-men, and that in his flesh dwelleth no good thing. And the Indian has acknowledged
that power; he has cast his idols of cruelty and revenge, those virtues on which he prided
himself in the blindness of his heart, to the moles and the bats; he has bowed and adored at
the foot of the Cross. But it was not so in the days whereof I have spoken.

CHAPTER XII.

  "Must this sweet new-blown rose find such a winter
   Before her spring be past?"

  BEAUMONT AND FLETCHER

The little bark touched the stony point of Long Island. The Indian lifted his weeping prisoner
from the canoe, and motioned to her to move forward along the narrow path that led to the camp,
about twenty yards higher up the bank, where there was a little grassy spot enclosed with shrubby
trees; the squaws tarried at the lake-shore to bring up the paddles and secure the canoe.

It is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of an enemy, but doubly so when that enemy is
a stranger to the language in which we would plead for mercy, whose god is not our God, nor
his laws those by which we ourselves are governed. Thus felt the poor captive as she stood
alone, mute with terror, among the half-naked, dusky forms with which she now found herself
surrounded. She cast a hurried glance round that strange assembly, if by chance her eye might
rest upon some dear familiar face; but she saw not the kind but grave face of Hector, nor met
the bright sparkling eyes of her cousin Louis, nor the soft, subdued, pensive features of the
Indian girl, her adopted sister. His education at one of seminaries, of etiquette, good and ample,
being pretty much confined to utile, are so necessary, branches are beside knowledge. And his father had
been a man of Indiana but greater pleasing and more intellect than many; she had been read much, and
on abolishment, in which he was one of Camp but s earliest companion, as he had, on several occasions,
her was proved that her will particularly to write once, though, she believe anything, he was ne'er
avowedly border.

Her had left to convey no collection of books, indeed that in school vacations natural means
were yield to son of indulging his taste for reading. A tribute Mr. Barton's father who will to
be establish in his Napoleon and other Women. Catharine, whose senses were beginning to be more collected, heard
the old man give orders that she was to be fed and cared for. Gladly did she escape from the
presence of those pitiless men, from whose gaze she shrunk with maidenly modesty. And now when
alone with the women she hesitated not to make use of that natural language which requires
not the aid of speech to make itself understood. Clasping her hands imploringly, she knelt
at the feet of the Indian woman, her conductress, kissed her dark hands, and bathed them with
her fast-flowing tears, while she pointed passionately to the shore where lay the happy home
from which she had been so suddenly torn.

The squaw, though she evidently comprehended the meaning of her imploring gestures, shook her
head, and in plaintive earnest tone replied in her own language that she must go with the canoes
to the other shore, and she pointed to the north as she spoke. She then motioned to the young
girl--the same that had been Catharine's companion in the canoe--to bring a hunting-knife which
was thrust into one of the folds of the birch-bark of the wigwam. Catharine beheld the deadly
weapon in the hands of the Indian woman with a pang of agony as great as if its sharp edge
was already at her throat. So young--so young, to die by a cruel bloody death! what had been
her crime? How should she find words to soften the heart of her murderess? The power of utterance
seemed denied. She cast herself on her knees and held up her hands in silent prayer; not to
the dreaded Indian woman, but to Him who heareth the prayer of the poor destitute--who alone
can order the unruly wills and affections of men.

The squaw stretched forth one dark hand and grasped the arm of the terror-stricken girl, while
the other held the weapon of destruction. With a quick movement she severed the thongs that
bound the fettered wrists of the pleading captive, and with a smile that seemed to light up
her whole face she raised her from her prostrate position, laid her hand upon her young head
and with an expression of good-humoured surprise lifted the flowing tresses of her sunny hair
and spread them over the back of her own swarthy hand; then, as if amused by the striking contrast,
she shook down her own jetty-black hair and twined a tress of it with one of the fair-haired
girl's, then laughed till her teeth shone like pearls within her red lips. Many were the exclamations
of childish wonder that broke from the other females as they compared the snowy arm of the
stranger with their own dusky skins: it was plain that they had no intention of harming her,
and by degrees distrust and dread of her singular companions began in some measure to subside.

The squaw motioned her to take a seat on a mat beside her, and gave her a handful of parched
rice and some deer's flesh to eat; but Catharine's heart was too heavy. She was suffering from
thirst; and on pronouncing the Indian word for water, the young girl snatched up a piece of
birch-bark from the floor of the tent, and gathering the corners together, ran to the lake,
and soon returned with water in this most primitive drinking-vessel, which she held to the
lips of her guest, and she seemed amused by the long, deep draught with which Catharine slaked
her thirst. Something like a gleam of hope came over Catharine's mind as she marked the look
of kindly feeling with which she caught the young Indian girl regarding her, and she strove
to overcome the choking sensation that would from time to time rise to her throat as she fluctuated
between hope and fear. The position of the Indian camp was so placed that it was quite hidden
from the shore and Catharine could neither see the mouth of the ravine, nor the steep side
of the mount that her brother and cousin were accustomed to ascend and descend in their visits
to the lake-shore, nor had she any means of making a signal to them even if she had seen them
on the beach.

The long, anxious, watchful night passed, and soon after sunrise, while the morning mists still
hung over the lake, the canoes of the Indians were launched, and long before noon they were
in the mouth of the river. Catharine's heart sunk within her as the fast receding shores of
the lake showed each minute fainter in the distance. At mid-day they halted at a fine bend
in the river, and landed on a small open place where a creek flowing down through the woods
afforded them cool water; here they found several tents put up and a larger party awaiting
their return. The river was here a fine, broad, deep, and tranquil stream; trees of many kinds
fringed the edge, beyond was the unbroken forest, whose depths had never been pierced by the
step of man--so thick and luxuriant was the vegetation that even the Indian could hardly have
penetrated through its dark, swampy glades: far as the eye could reach, that impenetrable,
interminable wall of verdure stretched away into the far-off distance.

All the remainder of that sad day Catharine sat on the grass under a shady tree, her eyes mournfully
fixed on the slow-flowing waters, and wondering at her own hard fate in being thus torn from
her home and its dear inmates. Bad as she had thought her separation from her father and mother
and her brothers, when she first left her home to become a wanderer on the Rice Lake Plains,
how much more dismal now was her situation, snatched from the dear companions who had upheld
and cheered her on in all her sorrows! Now that she was alone with none to love or cherish
or console her, she felt a desolation of spirit that almost made her forgetful of the trust
that had hitherto always sustained her in time of trouble or sickness. She looked round, and
her eye fell on the strange, unseemly forms of men and women who cared not for her, and to
whom she was an object of indifference or aversion; she wept when she thought of the grief
her absence would occasion to Hector and Louis; the thought of their distress increased her own.

The soothing quiet of the scene, with the low, lulling sound of the little brook as its tiny
wavelets fell tinkling over the mossy roots and stones that impeded its course to the river,
joined with fatigue and long exposure to the sun and air, caused her at length to fall asleep.
The last rosy light of the setting sun was dyeing the waters with a glowing tint when she awoke;
a soft blue haze hung upon the trees; the kingfisher and dragon-fly, and a solitary loon, were
the only busy things abroad on the river,--the first darting up and down from an upturned root,
near the water's edge, feeding its younglings; the dragon-fly hawking with rapid whirring sound
for insects; and the loon, just visible from above the surface of the still stream, sailing
quietly on companionless like her who watched its movements.

The bustle of the hunters returning with game and fish to the encampment roused many a sleepy
brown papoose; the fires were renewed, the evening was now preparing, and Catharine, chilled
by the falling dew, crept to the enlivening warmth. And here she was pleased at being recognized
by one friendly face; it was the mild, benevolent countenance of the widow Snowstorm, who,
with her three sons, came to bid her to share their camp fire and food. The kindly grasp of
the hand and the beaming smile that were given by this good creature, albeit she was ugly and
ill-featured, cheered the sad captive's heart. She had given her a cup of cold water and such
food as her log-cabin afforded; in return the good Indian took her to her wigwam and fed, warmed,
and cherished her with the loving-kindness of a Christian. During all her sojourn in the Indian
camp, the widow Snowstorm was as a tender mother to her, drying her tears and showing her those
little acts of attention that even the untaught Indians know are grateful to the sorrowful
and destitute. Catharine often forgot her own griefs to repay this worthy creature's kindness,
by attending to her little babe, and assisting her in her homely cookery or household work. The

Once she seemed particularly attracted by Catharine's dress, which she examined with critical
minuteness, evincing great surprise at the cut fringes of dressed doe-skin with which Indiana
had ornamented the border of the short jacket she had manufactured for Catharine. These fringes
she pointed out to the notice of the women, and even the old chief was called in to examine
the dress; nor did the leggings and moccasins escape their observation. There was something
mysterious about her garments. Catharine was at a loss to imagine what caused those deep guttural
exclamations, somewhat between a grunt and a groan, that burst from the lips of the Indians,
as they one by one examined her dress with deep attention. These people had recognized in these
things the peculiar fashion and handiwork of the young Mohawk girl whom they had exposed to
perish by hunger and thirst on Bare Hill; and much their interest was excited to learn by what
means Catharine had become possessed of a dress wrought by the hand of one whom they had numbered
with the dead. Strange and mysterious did it seem to them, and warily did they watch the unconscious
object of their wonder.

The knowledge she possessed of the language of her friend Indiana enabled Catharine to comprehend
a great deal of what was said; yet she prudently refrained from speaking in the tongue of one
to whose whole nation she knew these people to be hostile. But she sedulously endeavoured to
learn their own peculiar dialect; and in this she succeeded in an incredibly short time, so
that she was soon able to express her own wants, and converse a little with the females who
were about her.

She had noticed that among the tents there was one which stood apart from the rest, and was
only visited by the old chief and his grand-daughter, or by the elder women. At first she imagined
it was some sick person, or a secret tent set apart for the worship of the Great Spirit; but
one day, when the chief of the people had gone up the river hunting, and the children were
asleep, the curtain of skins was drawn back, and a female of singular and striking beauty appeared
in the open space in front. She was habited in a fine tunic of white dressed doe-skin, richly
embroidered with coloured beads and stained quills; a full petticoat of dark cloth bound with
scarlet descended to her ankles; leggings fringed with deerskin, knotted with bands of coloured
quills, with richly wrought moccasins on her feet. On her head she wore a coronet of scarlet
and black feathers; her long shining tresses of raven hair descended to her waist, each thick
tress confined with a braided band of quills, dyed scarlet and blue. She was tall and well-formed;
her large, liquid, dark eyes wore an expression so proud and mournful that Catharine felt her
own involuntarily fill with tears as she gazed upon this singular being. She would have approached
nearer to her, but a spell seemed on her; she shrunk back timid and abashed beneath that wild,
melancholy glance. It was she, the Beam of the Morning, the self-made widow of the young Mohawk,
whose hand had wrought so fearful a vengeance on the treacherous destroyer of her brother.
She stood there, at the tent-door, arrayed in her bridal robes, as on the day when she received
her death-doomed victim. And when she recalled her fearful deed, shuddering with horror, Catharine
drew back and shrouded herself within the tent, fearing again to fall under the eye of that
terrible woman. She remembered how Indiana had told her that since that fatal marriage-feast
she had been kept apart from the rest of the tribe,-- she was regarded by her people as a sacred
character, entitled the Great Medicine, a female brave, a being whom they regarded with mysterious
reverence. She had made this great sacrifice for the good of her nation. Indiana said it was
believed among her own folk that she had loved the young Mohawk passionately, as a tender woman
loves the husband of her youth; yet she had not hesitated to sacrifice him with her own hand.
Such was the deed of the Indian heroine--and such were the virtues of the unregenerated Greeks
and Romans!

CHAPTER XIII.

The Indian camp remained for nearly three weeks on this spot, and then early one morning the
wigwams were all taken down, and the canoes, six in number, proceeded up the river. There was
very little variety in the scenery to interest Catharine. The river still kept its slow-flowing
course between low shores thickly clothed with trees, without an opening through which the
eye might pierce to form an idea of the country beyond; not a clearing, not a sight or sound
of civilized man was there to be seen or heard; the darting flight of the wild birds as they
flitted across from one side to the other, the tapping of the woodpecker, or shrill cry of
the blue jay was all that was heard, from sunrise to sunset, on that monotonous voyage. After
many hours, a decided change was perceived in the current, which ran at a considerable increase
of swiftness, so that it required the united energy of both men and women to keep the light
vessels from drifting down the river again. They were in the rapids, and it was hard work to
stem the tide and keep the upward course of the waters. At length the rapids were passed, and
the weary Indian voyagers rested for a space on the bosom of a small but tranquil lake. The
rising moon shed her silvery light upon the calm water, and heaven's stars shone down into
its quiet depths, as the canoes with their dusky freight parted the glittering rays with their
light paddles. As they proceeded onward the banks rose on either side, still fringed with pines,
cedars, and oaks. At an angle of the lake the banks on either side ran out into two opposite
peninsulas, forming a narrow passage or gorge, contracting the lake once more into the appearance
of a broad river, much wider from shore to shore than any other part they had passed through
since they had left the entrance at the Rice Lake.

Catharine became interested in the change of scenery; her eye dwelt with delight on the forms
of glorious spreading oaks and lofty pines, green cliff-like shores, and low wooded islands;
while, as they proceeded, the sound of rapid-flowing waters met her ear, and soon the white
and broken eddies, rushing along with impetuous course, were seen by the light of the moon;
and while she was wondering if the canoes were to stem those rapids, at a signal from the old
chief, the little fleet was pushed to shore on a low flat of emerald verdure, nearly opposite
to the last island.

Here, under the shelter of some beautiful spreading black oaks, the women prepared to set up
their wigwams. They had brought the poles and birch-bark covering from the encampment below,
and soon all was bustle and business, unloading the canoes and raising the tents. Even Catharine
lent a willing hand to assist the females in bringing up the stores and sundry baskets containing
fruits and other small wares. She then kindly attended to the Indian children--certain dark-skinned
babes, who, bound upon their wooden cradles, were either set up against the trunks of the trees,
or swung to some lowly depending branch, there to remain helpless and uncomplaining spectators
of the scene.

Catharine thought these Indian babes were almost as much to be pitied as herself, only that
they were unconscious of their imprisoned state, having from birth been used to no better treatment,
and moreover they were sure to be rewarded by the tender caresses of loving mothers when the
season of refreshment and repose arrived but she, alas! was friendless and alone, bereft of
father, mother, kindred, and friends. One Father, one Friend, poor Catharine, thou hadst, even
he, the Father of the fatherless.

That night, when the women and children were sleeping, Catharine stole out of the wigwam, and
climbed the precipitous bank beneath the shelter of which the lodges had been erected. She
found herself upon a grassy plain, studded with majestic oaks and pines, so beautifully grouped
that they might have been planted by the hand of taste upon that velvet turf. It was a delightful
contrast to those dense dark forests through which for so many many miles the waters of the
Otonabee had flowed on monotonously; here it was all wild and free, dashing along like a restive
steed rejoicing in its liberty, uncurbed and tameless.

Yes, here it was beautiful! Catharine gazed with joy upon the rushing river, and felt her own
heart expand as she marked its rapid course as it bounded murmuring and fretting over its rocky
bed. "Happy, glorious waters! you are not subject to the power of any living creature; no canoe
can ascend those surging waves. I would that I too, like thee, were free to pursue my onward
way; how soon would I flee away and be at rest!" Such thoughts passed through the mind of the
lonely captive girl, as she sat at the foot of a giant oak, and looked abroad over those moonlit
waters, till oppressed by an overwhelming sense of the utter loneliness of the scene, the timid
girl with faltering step hurried down once more to the wigwams, silently crept to the mat where
her bed was spread, and soon forgot all her woes and wanderings in deep, tranquil sleep.

Catharine wondered that the Indians in erecting their lodges always seemed to prefer the low,
level, and often swampy grounds by the lakes and rivers in preference to the higher and more
healthy elevations. So disregardful are they of this circumstance, that they do not hesitate
to sleep where the ground is saturated with moisture. They will then lay a temporary flooring
of cedar or any other bark beneath their feet, rather than remove the tent a few feet higher
up, where a drier soil may always be found. This arises either from stupidity or indolence,
perhaps from both, but it is no doubt the cause of much of the sickness that prevails among
them. With his feet stretched to the fire, the Indian cares for nothing else when reposing
in his wigwam, and it is useless to urge the improvement that might be made in his comfort;
he listens with a face of apathy, and utters his everlasting guttural, which saves him the
trouble of a more rational reply.

"Snow-bird" informed Catharine that the lodges would not again be removed for some time, but
that the men would hunt and fish, while the squaws pursued their domestic labours. Catharine
perceived that the chief of the laborious part of the work fell to the share of the females,
who were very much more industrious and active than their husbands; those, when not out hunting
or fishing, were to be seen reposing in easy indolence under the shade of the trees, or before
the tent fires, giving themselves little concern about anything that was going on. The idiom were

CHAPTER XIV.

  "Cold and forsaken, destitute of friends,
   And all good comforts else, unless some tree
   Whose speechless chanty doth better ours,
   With which the bitter east winds made their sport,
   And sang through hourly, hath invited thee
   To shelter half a day. Shall she be thus,
   And I draw in soft slumbers?"

  BEAUMONT AND FLETCHER.

It was near sunset before Hector and his companions returned on the evening of the eventful
day that had found Catharine a prisoner on Long Island. They had met with good success in hunting,
and brought home a fine half-grown fawn, fat and in good order. They were surprised at finding
the fire nearly extinguished, and no Catharine awaiting their return. There, it is true, was
the food that she had prepared for them, but she was not to be seen. Supposing that she had
been tired of waiting for them, and had gone out to gather strawberries, they did not at first
feel anxious, but ate of the rice and honey, for they were hungry with long fasting. Then taking
some Indian meal cake in their hands, they went out to call her in; but no trace of her was
visible. Fearing she had set off by herself to seek them, and had missed her way home again,
they hurried back to the happy valley,--she was not there; to Pine-tree Point,--no trace of
her there; to the edge of the mount that overlooked the lake,--she was not to be seen: night
found them unsuccessful in their search. Sometimes they fancied that she had seated herself
beneath some tree and fallen asleep; but no one imagined the true cause, nothing having been
seen of the Indians since they had proceeded up the river.

Again they retraced their steps back to the house; but they found her not there. They continued
their unavailing search till the moon setting left them in darkness, and they lay down to rest,
but not to sleep. The first streak of dawn saw them again hurrying to and fro, calling in vain
upon the name of the loved and lost companion of their wanderings.

Indiana, whose vigilance was untiring--for she yielded not easily to grief and despair--now
returned with the intelligence that she had discovered the Indian trail, through the big ravine
to the lake-shore; she had found the remains of a wreath of oak leaves which had been worn
by Catharine in her hair; and she had seen the mark of feet, Indian feet, on the soft clay
at the edge of the lake, and the furrowing of the shingles by the pushing off of a canoe. Poor
Louis gave way to transports of grief and despair; he knew the wreath, it was such as Catharine
often made for herself, and Mathilde, and petite Louise, and Marie; his mother had taught her
to make them; they were linked together by the stalks, and formed a sort of leaf chain. Louis
placed the torn relic in his breast, and sadly turned away to hide his grief from Hector and
the Indian girl.

Indiana now proposed searching the island for further traces, but advised wariness in so doing.
They saw, however, neither smoke nor canoes. The Indians had departed while they were searching
the ravines and flats round Mount Ararat, and the lake told no tales, The following day they
ventured to land on Long Island, and on going to the north side saw evident traces of a temporary
encampment having been made, but no trace of any violence having been committed. It was Indiana's
opinion that, though a prisoner, Catharine was unhurt, as the Indians rarely killed women and
children, unless roused to do so by some signal act on the part of their enemies, when an exterminating
spirit of revenge induced them to kill and spare not; but where no offence had been offered,
they were not likely to take the life of a helpless, unoffending female. The Indian is not
cruel for the wanton love of blood, but to gratify revenge for some injury done to himself
or to his tribe. But it was difficult to still the terrible apprehensions that haunted the
minds of Louis and Hector. They spent much time in searching the northern shores and the distant
islands, in the vain hope of finding her, as they still thought the camp might have been moved
to the opposite side of the lake.

Inconsolable for the loss of their beloved companion, Hector and Louis no longer took interest
in what was going on; they hardly troubled themselves to weed the Indian corn, in which they
had taken such great delight; all now seemed to them flat, stale, and unprofitable; they wandered
listlessly to and fro, silent and sad; the sunshine had departed from their little dwelling;
they ate little, and talked less, each seeming absorbed in his own painful reveries.

In vain the gentle Indian girl strove to revive their drooping spirits; they seemed insensible
to her attentions, and often left her for hours alone. They returned one evening about the
usual hour of sunset, and missed their meek, uncomplaining guest from the place she was wont
to occupy. They called, but there was none to reply,--she too was gone. They hurried to the
shore just time enough to see the canoe diminishing to a mere speck upon the waters, in the
direction of the mouth of the river; they called to her, in accents of despair, to return,
but the wind wafted back no sound to their ears and soon the bark was lost to sight, and they
sat them down disconsolately on the shore.

"What is she doing?" said Hector. "It is cruel to abandon us thus."

"She has gone up the river, in the hope of bringing us some tidings of Catharine," said Louis.

"How came you to think that such is her intention?"

"I heard her say the other day that she would go and bring her back, or die."

"What! do you think she would risk the vengeance of the old chief whose life she attempted
to take?"

"She is a brave girl; she does not fear pain or death to serve those she loves."

"How can she, unprotected and alone, dare such perils? Why did she not tell us? We would have
shared her danger."

"She feared for our lives more than for her own; that poor Indian girl has a noble heart. I
care not now what befalls us; we have lost all that made life dear to us," said Louis gloomily,
sinking his head between his knees.

"Hush, Louis; you are older than I, and ought to bear these trials with more courage. It was
our own fault Indiana's leaving us; we left her so much alone to pine after her lost companion,
she seemed to think that we did not care for her. Poor Indiana, she must have felt lonely and sad."

"I tell you what we will do, Hec,--make a log canoe. I found an old battered one lying on the
shore, not far from Pine-tree Point. We have an axe and a tomahawk,--what should hinder us
from making one like it?"

"True! we will set about it to-morrow."

"I wish it were morning, that we might set to work to cut down a good pine for the purpose."

"As soon as it is done, we will go up the river; anything is better than this dreadful suspense
and inaction."

The early dawn saw the two cousins busily engaged chopping at a tree of suitable dimensions.
They worked hard all that day, and the next, and the next, before the canoe was hollowed out;
but, owing to their inexperience and the bluntness of their tools, their first attempt proved
abortive--it was too heavy at one end, and did not balance well in the water.

Louis, who had been quite sure of success, was disheartened; not so Hector.

"Do not let us give it up: my maxim is perseverance; let us try again, and again--ay, and a
fourth and a fifth time. I say, never give it up; that is the way to succeed at last."

"You have ten times my patience, Hec."

"Yes; but you are more ingenious than I, and are excellent at starting an idea."

"We are a good pair then for partnership."

"We will begin anew and this time I hope we shall profit by our past blunders."

"Who would imagine that it is now more than a month since we lost Catharine?"

"I know it--long, long, weary month," replied Louis; and he struck his axe sharply into the
bark of the pine as he spoke, and remained silent for some minutes. The boys, wearied by chopping
down the tree, rested from their work, and sat down on the side of the condemned canoe to resume
their conversation. Suddenly Louis grasped Hector's arm, and pointed to a bark canoe that appeared
making for the westernmost point of the island. Hector started to his feet, exclaiming, "It
is Indiana returned!"

"Nonsense! Indiana!--it is no such thing. Look you, it is a stout man in a blanket coat."

"The Indians?" asked Hector, inquiringly.

"I do not think he looks like an Indian; but let us watch. What is he doing?"

"Fishing. See now, he has just caught a fine bass--another--he has great luck--now he is pushing
the canoe ashore."

"That man does not move like an Indian--hark! he is whistling. I ought to know that tune. It
sounds like the old chanson my father used to sing;" and Louis, raising his voice, began to
sing the words of an old French Canadian song, which we will give in the English, as we heard
it sung by an old lumberer,--

  "Down by those banks where the pleasant waters flow,
   Through the wild woods we'll wander, and we'll chase the buffalo.
   And we'll chase the buffalo."

"Hush, Louis! you will bring the man over to us," said Hector.

"The very thing I am trying to do, mon ami. This is our country, and that may be his; but we
are lords here, and two to one, so I think he will not be likely to treat us ill. I am a man
now, and so are you, and he is but one; so he must mind how he affronts us," replied Louis,
laughing. I used to listen with open ears to it when I was a boy. I never thought to hear it
again, and to hear it here of all places in the world!"

"Come, let us go on with our work," said Hector, with something like impatience in his voice,
and the strokes of his axe fell once more in regular succession on the log; but Louis's eye
was still on the mysterious fisher, whom he could discern lounging on the grass and smoking
his pipe. "I do not think he sees or hears us," said Louis to himself, "but I think I'll manage
to bring him over soon;" and he set himself busily to work to scrape up the loose chips and
shavings, and soon began to strike fire with his knife and flint.

"What are you about, Louis?" asked Hector.

"Lighting a fire."

"It is warm enough without a fire, I am sure."

"I know that; but I want to attract the notice of yonder tiresome fisherman."

"And perhaps bring a swarm of savages down upon us, who may be lurking in the bushes of the
island."

"Pooh, pooh! Hec; there are no savages. I am weary of this place-- anything is better than
this horrible solitude." And Louis fanned the flame into a rapid blaze, and heaped up the light
dry branches till it soared up among the bushes. Louis watched the effect of his fire, and
rubbed his hands gleefully as the bark canoe was pushed off from the island, and a few vigorous
strokes of the paddle sent it dancing over the surface of the calm lake.

Louis waved his cap above his head with a cheer of welcome as the vessel lightly glided into
the little cove, near the spot where the boys were chopping, and a stout-framed, weather-beaten
man, in a blanket coat, also faded and weather-beaten, with a red worsted sash and worn moccasins,
sprang upon one of the timbers of Louis's old raft, and gazed with a keen eye upon the lads.
Each party silently regarded the other. A few rapid interrogations from the stranger, uttered
in the broad patois of the Lower Province, were answered in a mixture of broken French and
English by Louis.

A change like lightning passed over the face of the old man as he cried out--"Louis Perron,
son of my ancient compagnon!"

"Oui! oui!"--with eyes sparkling through tears of joy, Louis threw himself into the broad breast
of Jacob Morelle, his father's friend and old lumbering comrade.

"Hector, son of la belle Catharine Perron!" and Hector, in his turn, received the affectionate
embrace of the warm-hearted old man.

"Who would have thought of meeting with the children of my old comrade here at the shore of
the Rice Lake? Oh! what a joyful meeting!"

Jacob had a hundred questions to ask--Where were their parents? did they live on the Plains
now? how long was it since they had left the Cold Springs? were there any more little ones?
and so forth.

The boys looked sorrowfully at each other. At last the old man stopped for want of breath,
and remarked their sad looks.

Hector told the old lumberer how long they had been separated from their families, and by what
sad accident they had been deprived of the society of their beloved sister. When they brought
their narrative down to the disappearance of Catharine, the whole soul of the old trapper seemed
moved; he started from the log on which they were sitting, and with one of his national asseverations,
declared "that he, her father's old friend, would go up the river and bring her back in safety,
or leave his gray scalp behind him among the wigwams."

"It is too late, Jacob, to think of starting to-day," said Hector. "Come home with us, and
eat some food, and rest a bit."

"No need of that, my son I have a lot of fish here in the canoe; and there is an old shanty
on the island yonder, if it be still standing--the Trapper's Fort I used to call it some years
ago. We will go off to the island and look for it."

"No need for that," replied Louis, "though I can tell you the old place is still in good repair,
for we used it this very spring as a boiling-house for our maple sap. We have a better place
of our own nearer at hand--just two or three hundred yards over the brow of yonder hill. So
come with us, and you shall have a good supper, and bed to lie upon."

"And you have all these, boys!" said Jacob opening his merry black eyes, as they came in sight
of the little log-house and the field of green corn.

The old man praised the boys for their industry and energy. "Ha! here is old Wolfe too," as
the dog roused himself from the hearth, and gave one of his low grumbling growls. He had grown
dull and dreamy, and instead of going out as usual with the young hunters, he would lie for
hours dozing before the dying embers of the fire. Its kernel, though still be sensuous, travel triumph

But her deem they deem they is of priestess, in family, as they was however be placed in separation,

interest, and while it use husband, heretofore will itself is whittle

 I know the Indians: they are a
suspicious people; they deal much in stratagems; and they are apt to expect treachery in others.
Perhaps they have had some reason; for the white men have not always kept good faith with them,
which I take to be the greater shame, as they have God's laws to guide and teach them to be
true and just in their dealing, which the poor benighted heathen have not, the more's the pity.
Now, d'ye see, if the Indians see two stout lads with me, they will say to themselves there
may be more left behind, skulking in ambush. So, boys, I go to the camp alone; and, God willing,
I will bring back your sister, or die in the attempt. I shall not go empty-handed; see, I have
here scarlet cloth, beads, and powder and shot. I carry no fire-water: it is a sin and a shame
to tempt these poor wretches to their own destruction; it makes fiends of them at once."

It was to no purpose that Hector and Louis passionately besought old Jacob to let them share
the dangers of the expedition; the old man was firm, and would not be moved from his purpose.

"Look you, boys," he said, "if I do not return by the beginning of the rice-harvest, you may
suppose that evil has befallen me and the girl. Then I would advise you to take care for your
own safety; for if they do not respect my gray head, neither will they spare your young ones.
In such case make yourselves a good canoe--a dug-out [Footnote: Log-canoe] will do--and go
down the lake till you are stopped by the rapids; [Footnote: Heeley's Falls, on the Trent]
make a portage there; but as your craft is too weighty te carry far, e'en leave her and chop
out another, and go down to the falls; [Footnote: Crook's Rapids.] then, if you do not like
to be at any further trouble, you may make out your journey to the bay [Footnote: Bay Quinte]
on foot, coasting along the river; there you will fall in with settlers who know old Jacob
Morelle, ay, and your two fathers, and they will put you in the way of returning home. If I
were to try ever so to put you on the old Indian trail in the woods, though I know it myself
right well, you might be lost, and maybe never return home again. I leave my traps and my rifle
with you; I shall not need them. If I come back I may claim the things; if not, they are yours.
So now I have said my say, had my talk, as the Indians say. Farewell. But first let us pray
to Him who alone can bring this matter to a safe issue." And the old man devoutly kneeled down,
and prayed for a blessing on his voyage and on those he was leaving; and then hastened down
to the beach, and the boys, with full hearts, watched the canoe till it was lost to their sight
on the wide waters of the lake.

CHAPTER XV.

  "Where wild in woods the lordly savage ran."

  --DRYDEN

The setting sun was casting long shadows of oak and weeping elm athwart the waters of the river;
the light dip of the paddle had ceased on the water, the baying of hounds and life-like stirring
sounds from the lodges came softened to the listening ear. The hunters had come in with the
spoils of a successful chase; the wigwam tires are flickering and crackling, sending up their
light columns of thin blue smoke among the trees; and now a goodly portion of venison is roasting
on the forked sticks before the fires. Each lodge has its own cooking utensils. That jar embedded
in the hot embers contains sassafras tea, an aromatic beverage in which the squaws delight
when they are so fortunate as to procure a supply. This has been brought from the Credit, far
up in the west, by a family who have come down on a special mission from some great chief to
his brethren on the Otonabee, and the squaws have cooked some in honour of the guests. That
pot that sends up such a savoury steam is venison-pottage, or soup, or stew, or any name you
choose to give the Indian mess that is concocted of venison, wild rice, and herbs. Those tired
hounds that lie stretched before the fire have been out, and now they enjoy the privilege of
the fire, some praise from the hunters, and receive withal an occasional reproof from the squaws,
if they approach their wishful noses too close to the tempting viands.

The elder boys are shooting at a mark on yonder birch-tree, the girls are playing or rolling
on the grass, the "Snow-Bird" is seated on the floor of the wigwam braiding a necklace of sweet
grass, which she confines in links by means of little bands of coloured quills, Catharine is
working moccasins beside her. A dark shadow falls across her work from the open tent door;
an exclamation of surprise and displeasure from one of the women makes Catharine raise her
eyes to the doorway. There, silent, pale, and motionless, the mere shadow of her former self,
stands Indiana; a gleam of joy lights for an instant her large lustrous eyes. Amazement and
delight at the sight of her beloved friend for a moment deprive Catharine of the power of speech,
then terror for the safety of her friend takes the place of her joy at seeing her. She rises
regardless of the angry tones of the Indian woman's voice, and throws her arms about Indiana,
as if to shield her from threatened danger, and sobs her welcome in her arms.

"Indiana, dear sister! how came you hither, and for what purpose?"

"To free you, and then die," was the soft, low, tremulous answer. "Follow me."

Catharine, wondering at the calm and fearless manner with which the young Mohawk waved back
the dusky matron who approached as if with the design of laying hands upon her unwelcome guest,
followed with beating heart till they stood in the entrance of the lodge of the Bald Eagle.
It was filled with the hunters, who were stretched on skins on the floor, reposing in quiet
after the excitement of the chase.

The young Mohawk bent her head down and crossed her arms over her breast, an attitude of submission,
as she stood in the opening of the lodge; but she spoke no word till the old chief, waving
back the men who, starting to their feet, were gathering round him as if to shield him from
danger, and sternly regarding her, demanded from whence she came and for what purpose.

"To submit myself to the will of my Ojebwa father," was the meek reply. "May the daughter of
the Bald Eagle's enemy speak to her great father?"

"Say on," was the brief reply; "the Bald Eagle's ears are open."

"The Bald Eagle is a mighty chief, the conqueror of his enemies, and the father of his people,"
replied the Mohawk girl, and again was silent.

"The Mohawk squaw speaks well; let her say on."

"The heart of the Mohawk is an open flower; it can be looked upon by the eye of the Great Spirit.
She speaks the words of truth. The Ojebwa chief slew his enemies: they had done his good heart
wrong; he punished them for the wrong they wrought; he left none living in the lodges of his
enemies save one young squaw, the daughter of a brave, the grand-daughter of the Black Snake.
The Bald Eagle loves even an enemy that is not afraid to raise the war-whoop or fling the tomahawk
in battle. The young girl's mother was a brave." She paused, while her proud eyes were fixed
on the face of her aged auditor. He nodded assent, and she resumed, while a flush of emotion
kindled her pale cheek and reddened her lips:--

"The Bald Eagle brought the lonely one to his lodge; he buried the hatchet and the scalping-knife,
he bade his squaws comfort her: but her heart was lonely, she pined for the homes of her fathers.
She said, I will revenge my father, my mother, and my brothers and sisters; and her heart burned
within her. But her hand was not strong to shed blood; the Great Spirit was about my Ojebwa
father. She failed, and would have fled, for an arrow was in her flesh. The people of the Bald
Eagle took her; they brought her down the great river to the council hill; they bound her with
thongs, and left her to die. She prayed, and the Great Spirit heard her prayer and sent her
help. The white man came; his heart was soft: he unbound her, he gave water to cool her hot
lips, he led her to his lodge. The white squaw (and she pointed to Catharine) was there; she
bound up her wounds, she laid her on her own bed, she gave her meat and drink, and tended her
with love. She taught her to pray to the Good Spirit, and told her to return good for evil,
to be true and just, kind and merciful. The hard heart of the young girl became soft as clay
when moulded for the pots, and she loved her white sister and brothers, and was happy. The
Bald Eagle's people came when my white brothers were at peace; they found a trembling fawn
within the lodge; they led her away; they left tears and loneliness where joy and peace had
been. The Mohawk squaw could not see the hearth of her white brothers desolate. She took the
canoe; she came to the lodge of the great father of his tribe, and she says to him, Give back
the white squaw to her home on the Rice Lake, and take in her stead the rebellious daughter
of the Ojebwa's enemy, to die or be his servant; she fears not now the knife or the tomahawk,
the arrow or the spear: her life is in the hand of the great chief." She sank on her knees
as she spoke these last words, and bowing down her head on her breast remained motionless as
a statue.

There was silence for some minutes, and then the old man rose and said:--

"Daughter of a brave woman, thou hast spoken long, and thou hast spoken well; the ears of the
Bald Eagle have been opened. The white squaw shall be restored to her brother's lodge; but
thou remainest. I have spoken."

Catharine, in tears, cast her arms round her disinterested friend and remained weeping: how
could she accept this great sacrifice? She, in her turn, pleaded for the life and liberty of
the Mohawk, but the chief turned a cold ear to her passionate and incoherent pleading. He was
weary--he was impatient of further excitement--he coldly motioned to them to withdraw; and
the friends in sadness retired to talk over all that had taken place since that sad day when
Catharine was taken from her home. While her heart was joyful at the prospect of her own release,
it was clouded with fears for the uncertain fate of her beloved friend.

"They will condemn me to a cruel death," said Indiana; "but I can suffer and die for my white
sister."

That night the Indian girl slept sweetly and tranquilly beside Catharine. But Catharine could
not sleep; she communed with her own heart in the still watches of the night; it seemed as
if a new life had been infused within her. She no longer thought and felt as a child; the energies
of her mind had been awakened, ripened into maturity, as it were, and suddenly expanded. When
all the inmates of the lodges were profoundly sleeping, Catharine arose: a sudden thought had
entered into her mind, and she hesitated not to put her design into execution. There was no
moon, but a bright arch of light spanned the forest to the north; it was mild and soft as moonlight,
but less bright, and cast no shadow across her path; it showed her the sacred tent of the widow
of the murdered Mohawk. With noiseless step she lifted aside the curtain of skins that guarded
it, and stood at the entrance. Light as was her step, it awakened the sleeper; she raised herself
on her arm, and looked up with a dreamy and abstracted air as Catharine, stretching forth her
hand, in tones low and tremulous, thus addressed her in the Ojebwa tongue:--

"The Great Spirit sends me to thee, O woman of much sorrow; he asks of thee a great deed of
mercy and goodness. Thou hast shed blood, and he is angry. He bids thee to save the life of
an enemy--the blood of thy murdered husband flows in her veins. See that thou disobey not the
words that he commands."

She dropped the curtain and retired as she had come, with noiseless step, and lay down again
in the tent beside Indiana. Her heart beat as though it would burst its way through her bosom.
What had she done?--what dared? She had entered the presence of that terrible woman alone,
at the dead hour of night! she had spoken bold and presumptuous words to that strange being
whom even her own people hardly dared to approach uncalled for! Sick with terror at the consequences
of her temerity, Catharine cast her trembling arms about the sleeping Indian girl, and, hiding
her head in her bosom, wept and prayed till sleep came over her wearied spirit. It was late
when she awoke. She was alone; the lodge was empty. A vague fear seized her: she hastily arose
to seek her friend. It was evident that some great event was in preparation. The Indian men
had put on the war-paint, and strange and ferocious eyes were glancing from beneath their shaggy
locks. A stake was driven in the centre of the cleared space in front of the chief's lodge:
there, bound, she beheld her devoted friend; pale as ashes, but with a calm, unshaken countenance,
she stood. There was no sign of woman's fear in her fixed dark eye, which quailed not before
the sight of the death-dooming men who stood round her, armed with their terrible weapons of
destruction. Her thoughts seemed far away: perhaps they were with her dead kindred, wandering
in that happy land to which the Indian hopes to go after life; or, inspired with the new hope
which had been opened to her, she was looking to Him who has promised a crown of life to such
as believe in his name. She saw not the look of agony with which Catharine regarded her; and
the poor girl, full of grief, sunk down at the foot of a neighbouring tree, and, burying her
face between her knees, wept and prayed-oh, how fervently! A hope crept to her heart--even
while the doom of Indiana seemed darkest--that some good might yet accrue from her visit to
the wigwam of the Great Medicine squaw. She knew that the Indians have great belief in omens,
and warnings, and spirits both good and evil; she knew that her mysterious appearance at the
tent of the Mohawk's widow would be construed by her into spiritual agency; and her heart was
strengthened by this hope. Yet just now there seems little reason to encourage hope: the war-whoop
is given, the war-dance is begun--first slow, and grave, and measured; now louder, and quicker,
and more wild become both sound and movement. But why is it hushed again? See, a strange canoe
appears on the river; anon an old weather-beaten man, with firm step, appears on the greensward,
and approaches the area of the lodge.

The Bald Eagle greets him with friendly courtesy, the dance ceases and the death-song is hushed;
a treaty is begun. It is for the deliverance of the captives. The chief points to Catharine--she
is free; his white brother may take her--she is his. But the Indian law of justice must take
its course: the condemned, who raised her hand against an Ojebwa chief, must die. In vain are
the tempting stores of scarlet cloth and beads for the women, with powder and shot, laid before
the chief: the arrows of six warriors are fitted to the string, and again the dance and song
commence, as if, like the roll of the drum and, clangour of the trumpet, they were necessary
to the excitement of strong and powerful feelings, and the suppression of all tenderer emotions.

And now a wild and solemn voice is heard, unearthly in its tones, rising above the yells of
those savage men. At the sound every cheek becomes pale: it strikes upon the ear as some funeral
wail. Is it the death-song of the captive girl bound to that fearful stake? No; for she stands
unmoved, with eyes raised heavenward, and lips apart,--

   "In still but brave despair."

Shrouded in a mantle of dark cloth, her long black hair unbound and streaming over her shoulders,
appears the Mohawk widow, the daughter of the Ojebwa chief. The gathering throng fall back
as she approaches, awed by her sudden appearance among them. She stretches out a hand on which
dark stains are visible--it is the blood of her husband, sacrificed by her on that day of fearful
deeds: it has never been effaced. On the column to the prison wings then are reservoirs at containing water,
which is thrown up by a viscus worked by the prisoners for the tread-wheel, whenever cousin is
necessitate, and by implementation of lead pipes, it is there be conveyed
of every part of an prison. A knife is placed in her hand, while a deafening
yell of triumph bursts from the excited squaws, as this their great high priestess, as they
deem her, advances to the criminal. But it is not to shed the heart's blood of the Mohawk girl,
but to sever the thong that bind her to the deadly stake, for which that glittering blade is
drawn, and to bid her depart in peace whithersoever she would go.

Then, turning to the Bald Eagle, she thus addresses him: "At the dead of night, when the path
of light spanned the sky, a vision stood before mine eyes. It came from the Great and Good
Spirit, and bade me to set free the last of a murdered race, whose sun had gone down in blood
shed by my hand and by the hands of my people. The vision told me that if I did this my path
should henceforth be peace, and that I should go to the better land and be at rest if I did
this good deed." She then laid her hands on the head of the young Mohawk, blessed her, and,
enveloping herself in the dark mantle, slowly retired back to her solitary tent once more.

CHAPTER XVI.

  "Hame, hame, hame,
     Hame I soon shall be--
   Hame, hame, hame,
     In mine own countrie"

  --Scotch Ballad

Old Jacob and Catharine, who had been mute spectators of the scene so full of interest to them,
now presented themselves before the Ojebwa chief and besought leave to depart. The porcupine teacher
declares nothing to several-- section of his ketubim when Lorenzo had sounded all the coverage
of the philosophy, and had uttered his conviction that to Plato it would to be firmly in a bad
platonic or perform a citizen. The old man was not insensible to the noble sacrifice
which had been made by the devoted Indiana, and he signified his forgiveness of her fault by
graciously offering to adopt her as his child, and to give her in marriage to one of his grandsons,
an elder brother of the "Snow-bird;" but the young girl modestly but firmly refused this mark
of favour, for her heart yearned for those whose kindness had saved her from death, and who
had taught her to look beyond the things of this world to a brighter and a better state of
being. She said "she would go with her white sister, and pray to God to bless her enemies,
as the Great Spirit had taught her to do."

It seems a lingering principle of good in human nature that the exercise of mercy and virtue
opens the heart to the enjoyment of social happiness. The Indians, no longer worked up by excitement
to deeds of violence, seemed disposed to bury the hatchet of hatred, and the lodge was now
filled with mirth and the voice of gladness, feasting, and dancing. A covenant of peace and
good-will was entered upon by old Jacob and the chief, who bade Catharine tell her brothers
that from henceforth they should be free to hunt the deer, fish, or shoot the wild-fowl of
the lake whenever they desired to do so, "he, the Bald Eagle, had said so."
