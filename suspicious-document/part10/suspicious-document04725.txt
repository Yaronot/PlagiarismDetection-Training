MORIEN

A Metrical Romance rendered into English prose from the Mediaeval Dutch by Jessie L. Weston,
with designs by Caroline Watts. Preface

The metrical romance of which the following pages offer a prose translation is contained in
the mediaeval Dutch version of the Lancelot, where it occupies upwards of five thousand lines,
forming the conclusion of the first existing volume of that compilation. So far as our present
knowledge extends, it is found nowhere else.

Nor do we know the date of the original poem, or the name of the author. The Dutch MS. is of
the commencement of the fourteenth century, and appears to represent a compilation similar
to that with which Sir Thomas Malory has made us familiar, i.e., a condensed rendering of a
number of Arthurian romances which in their original form were independent of each other. Thus,
in the Dutch Lancelot we have not only the latter portion of the Lancelot proper, the Queste,
and the Morte Arthur, the ordinary component parts of the prose Lancelot in its most fully
developed form, but also a portion of a Perceval romance, having for its basis a version near
akin to, if not identical with, the poem of Chretien de Troyes, and a group of episodic romances,
some of considerable length, the majority of which have not yet been discovered elsewhere.
[Footnote: Cf. my Legend of Sir Lancelot du Lac; Grimm Library, vol. xii., chapter ix., where
a brief summary of the contents of the Dutch Lancelot is given.]

Unfortunately, the first volume of this compilation, which was originally in four parts, has
been lost; consequently we are without any of the indications, so often to be found in the
opening lines of similar compositions, as to the personality of the compiler, or the material
at his disposal; but judging from those sections in which comparison is possible, the Lancelot,
Queste, and Morte Arthur, the entire work is a translation, and a very faithful translation,
of a French original. It is quite clear that the Dutch compiler understood his text well, and
though possibly somewhat hampered by the necessity of turning prose into verse (this version,
contrary to the otherwise invariable rule of the later Lancelot romances, being rhymed), he
renders it with remarkable fidelity. The natural inference, and that drawn by M. Gaston Paris,
who, so far, appears to be the only scholar who has seriously occupied himself with this interesting
version, is that those episodic romances, of which we possess no other copy, are also derived
from a French source. Most probably, so far as these shorter romances are concerned, the originals
would be metrical, not prose versions, as in the case of the Lancelot sections.

It is true that with regard to the romance here translated, Morien, the Dutch scholars responsible
for the two editions in which it has appeared, MM. Jonckbloet and Te Winkel, the former the
editor of the whole compilation, the latter of this section only, are both inclined to regard
the poem as an original Dutch composition; but M. Gaston Paris, in his summary of the romance
(Histoire Litteraire, vol. xxx. p. 247) rejects this theory as based on inadequate grounds.
It must be admitted that an original Arthurian romance of the twelfth or thirteenth century,
when at latest such a poem would be written, in a language other than French, is so far unknown
to us; and although as a matter of fact the central motif of the poem, the representation of
a Moor as near akin to the Grail Winner, Sir Perceval, has not been preserved in any known
French text, while it does exist in a famous German version, I for one find no difficulty in
believing that the tradition existed in French, and that the original version of our poem was
a metrical romance in that tongue.

So far as the story of Morien is concerned, the form is probably later than the tradition it
embodies. In its present shape it is certainly posterior to the appearance of the Galahad Queste,
to which it contains several direct references; such are the hermit's allusion to the predicted
circumstances of his death, which are related in full in the Queste; the prophecy that Perceval
shall "aid" in the winning of the Holy Grail, a quest of which in the earlier version he is
sole achiever; and the explicit statements of the closing lines as to Galahad's arrival at
Court, his filling the Siege Perilous, and achieving the Adventures of the Round Table. As
the romance now stands it is an introduction to the Queste, with which volume iii. (volume
ii. of the extant version) of the Dutch Lancelot opens.

But the opening lines of the present version show clearly that in one important point, at least,
the story has undergone a radical modification. Was it the Dutch translator or his source who
substituted Agloval, Perceval's brother, for the tradition which made Perceval himself the
father of the hero? M. Gaston Paris takes the former view; but I am inclined to think that
the alteration was already in the French source. The Grail of Sir Agloval's vision is the Grail
of Castle Corbenic and the Queste; unless we are to consider this vision as the addition of
the Dutch compiler (who, when we are in a position to test his work does not interpolate such
additions), we must, I think, admit that the romance in the form in which it reached him was
already at a stage in which Perceval could not, without violence to the then existing conception
of his character, be considered as the father, or the brother, of Morien. To reconstruct the
original story it would be necessary not merely to eliminate all mention of Agloval, as suggested
by M. Gaston Paris, but the Grail references would also require modification. As it stands,
the poem is a curious mixture of conflicting traditions.

In this connection it appears to me that the evidence of the Parzival is of primary importance;
the circumstances attending the birth of Feirefis are exactly parallel with those of Morien--in
both a Christian knight wins the love of a Moorish princess; in both he leaves her before the
birth of her son, in the one case with a direct, in the other with a conditional, promise to
return, which promise is in neither instance kept; in both the lad, when grown to manhood,
sets out to seek his father; in both he apparently makes a practice of fighting with every
one whom he meets; in the one version he is brother, in the other son or nephew, to Perceval.
The points of difference are that whereas Morien is black all over, save his teeth, Feirefis
is parti-coloured, black and white--a curious conception, which seems to point to an earlier
stage of thought; Morien is a Christian, Feirefis a heathen--the more probable version.

It is easy to understand why the hero ceased to be considered Perceval's son--the opening lines
of the poem describe the situation perfectly; but I do not think it has been sufficiently realised
that precisely the same causes which would operate to the suppression of this relationship
would equally operate to the suppression of that of the Parzival. Perceval, the virgin winner
of the Grail, could not have a liaison with a Moorish princess, but neither could Perceval's
father, the direct descendant of Joseph of Arimathea, and hereditary holder of the Grail. The
Early History of that talisman, as related by Robert de Borron, once generally accepted, the
relationship of brother was as impossible as that of son.

It seems clear that if a genuine tradition of a Moor as near kinsman to Perceval really existed--and
I see no reason to doubt that it did--it must have belonged to the Perceval story prior to
the development of the Grail tradition, e.g., to such a stage as that hinted at by the chess-board
adventure of the "Didot" Engineering.

The romance as we have it presents, as remarked before, a curious mixture of earlier and later
elements. None of the adventures it relates are preserved in any English text. Alike as a representative
of a lost tradition, and for its own intrinsic merit it has seemed to me, though perhaps inferior
in literary charm to the romances previously published in this series, to be yet not unworthy
of inclusion among them.

BOURNEMOUTH, July 1901 Morien Herein doth the adventure tell of a knight who was named Morien.
Some of the books give us to wit that he was Perceval's son, and some say that he was son to
Agloval, who was Perceval's brother, so that he was nephew unto that good knight. Now we find
it written for a truth that Perceval and Galahad alike died virgin knights in the quest of
the Holy Grail; and for that cause I say of Perceval that in sooth he was not Morien's father,
but that rather was Morien his brother's son. And of a Moorish princess was he begotten at
that time when Agloval sought far and wide for Lancelot, who was lost, as ye have read here afore.

I ween that he who made the tale of Lancelot and set it in rhyme forgot, and was heedless of,
the fair adventure of Morien. I marvel much that they who were skilled in verse and the making
of rhymes did not bring the story to its rightful ending. Now as at this time King Arthur abode
in Britain, and held high court, that his fame might wax the greater; and as the noble folk
sat at the board and ate, there came riding a knight; for 'twas the custom in Arthur's days
that while the king held court no door, small nor great, should be shut, but all men were free
to come and go as they willed.

Thus the knight came riding where the high folk sat, and would fain have dismounted, but so
sorely was he wounded that he might not do so. In sooth he was in evil case, for he had more
than ten wounds, and from the least of them a man might scarce recover; he came in such guise
that his weapons and his vesture and his steed, which was fair and tall, were all dyed red
with his own blood. The knight was sad at heart and sorely wounded, yet he greeted, as best
he might, all the lords then in the hall; but more he might not speak, for the pain of his wounds.

Then my lord, Sir Gawain, who did full many a courtesy (for such was his wont all his life
long), so soon as he saw the knight, sprang up with no delay, and lifted him from the saddle
and set him upon the ground, but he might neither sit, nor walk, nor so much as stand upon
his feet, but fell upon the earth.

Then Sir Gawain bade them carry him softly on a couch to the side of the hall in the sight
of the chief guests, that they might hear his tale. But since he might scarce speak he made
him to be disarmed, and stripped to the skin, and wrapped in warm coverings and gave him a
sop steeped in clear wine.

Then Sir Gawain began to search his wounds, for in those days, so far as God suffered the sun
to shine might no man find one so skilled in leech-craft, for that man whom he took in his
care, were the life but left in him, would neither lack healing nor die of any wound.

Then spake the knight who lay there: "Woe is me, for I may neither eat nor drink; my heart
beginneth to sink, mine eyes fail me, methinks I am about to die! Yet might I live, and would
God grant to me that all ye who sit here beside me might hear my words, I had fain spoken with
the king, whom I sought as best I might, in that I would not be forsworn; needs must I come
hither!"

Then quoth Sir Gawain the good: "Sir Knight, have ye no dread of death as at this time, for
I shall help you to a respite." He drew forth from his pouch a root that had this virtue, that
it stayed the flow of blood and strengthened the feeble; he placed it in the knight's mouth,
and bade him eat a little; therewith was his heart lightened, and he began to eat and to drink,
and forgat somewhat of his pain.
