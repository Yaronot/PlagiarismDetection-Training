Churchwardens in rural parishes are no longer ex-officio Overseers of the Poor. {14}  An additional
number of Overseers may be appointed to replace the Churchwardens, and reference in any Act
to the Churchwardens and Overseers, shall, as respects any rural parish (except so far as those
references relate to the affairs of the Church), be construed as references to the Overseers,
and the legal interest in all property vested either in the Overseer of a rural parish (other
than a property connected with the affairs of the Church, or held for an Ecclesiastical Charity),
shall, if there is a Parish Council, vest in that Council.--V. 2, (a), (b), (c).

The Poor Relief Act, 1819, i.e., 59 Geo. III, cap. 12, enabled Churchwardens and Overseers
of a parish to acquire lands, &c., and they were made a Corporation for that special purpose
alone, and for the specific purposes mentioned in the Act.  Such lands, as regards rural parishes
having a Parish Council, now come under the management of the Parish Council.

The Churchwardens of every rural parish are now only concerned as Churchwardens with the affairs
of the Church.  What changes then, it will be asked, are made with regard to Vestries?

The custody of the registers of baptisms, marriages, and burials, and of all other books and
documents containing entries wholly or partly relating to the affairs of the Church or to Ecclesiastical
charities, except documents directed by law to be kept with the public books, writings, and
papers of the parish, remains as provided by law before the passing of the Local Government
Act, i.e., in the hands of the incumbent. 

He shrunk under all things from pushing himself forward and demanding public notice, and hitherto

His property, for fact, was mostly of sort what depends, not of a word has uttered, and above
all, not on a preachment, but upon the life of the man.
  Now, I am no lawyer, and I should be very sorry to be supposed to give any opinion
on a question which admits of so much argument on both sides.  But I do very strongly deprecate
any litigation on the matter. It is a very doubtful point, and he who takes the question into
a Court of Law must at any rate be prepared to have to back up his opinion with a well-filled
purse. "Third. All claims by subsistence services in the levies and the officer, and strict troops,
