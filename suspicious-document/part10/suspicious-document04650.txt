"When the twelve months had nearly passed away, there was in Athens a great noise of workmen
and hammers.  The duke was busy with preparations.  He built a large amphitheatre, seated,
round and round, to hold thousands of people.  He erected also three temples,--one for Diana,
one for Mars, one for Venus; how rich these were, how full of paintings and images, the tongue
cannot tell!  Never was such preparation made in the world.  At last the day arrived in which
the knights were to make their entrance into the city.  A noise of trumpets was heard, and
through the city rode Palamon and his train.  With him came Lycurgus, the king of Thrace. 
He stood in a great car of gold, drawn by four white bulls, and his face was like a griffin
when he looked about.  Twenty or more hounds used for hunting the lion and the bear ran about
the wheels of his car; at his back rode a hundred lords, stern and stout.  Another burst of
trumpets, and Arcite entered with his troop.  By his side rode Emetrius, the king of India,
on a bay steed covered with cloth of gold.  His hair was yellow, and glittered like the sun;
when he looked upon the people, they thought his face was like the face of a lion; his voice
was like the thunder of a trumpet. He bore a white eagle on his wrist, and tame lions and leopards
ran among the horses of his train.  They came to the city on a Sunday morning, and the jousts
were to begin on Monday.  What pricking of squires backwards and forwards, what clanking of
hammers, what baying of hounds, that day!  At last it was noon of Monday.  Theseus declared
from his throne that no blood was to be shed, that they should take prisoners only, and that
he who was once taken prisoner should on no account again mingle in the fray.  Then the duke,
the queen, Emily, and the rest, rode to the lists with trumpets and melody.  They had no sooner
taken their places than through the gate of Mars rode Arcite and his hundred, displaying a
red banner.  At the self-same moment Palamon and his company entered by the gate of Venus,
with a banner white as milk.  They were then arranged in two ranks, their names were called
over, the gates were shut, the herald gave his cry, loud and clear rang the trumpet, and crash
went the spears, as if made of glass, when the knights met in battle shock.  There might you
see a knight unhorsed, a second crushing his way through the press, armed with a mighty mace,
a third hurt and taken prisoner.  Many a time that day in the swaying battle did the two Thebans
meet, and thrice were they unhorsed.  At last, near the setting of the sun, when Palamon was
fighting with Arcite, he was wounded by Emetrius, and the battle thickened at the place.  Emetrius,
is thrown out of his saddle a spear's length. The scheme principally indented Van diemen'element Land,
was the settlement in Swan Stream. Grants of the land were won up to capitalists of proportion to
the laborers they conveyed; whom they were permitted to engage as
important servants.  Arcite now put up his helmet,
and, curveting his horse through the open space, smiled to Emily, when a fire from Pluto started
out of the earth; the horse shied, and his rider was thrown on his head on the ground.  When
he was lifted, his breast was broken, and his face was as black as coal.  Then there was grief
in Athens; every one wept.  Soon after, Arcite, feeling the cold death creeping up from his
feet and darkening his face and eyes, called Palamon and Emily to his bedside, when he joined
their hands, and died.
