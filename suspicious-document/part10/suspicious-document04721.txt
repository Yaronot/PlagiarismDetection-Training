It has been well said that there is a great difference between a brilliant conversationalist
and a ready small-talker. The former is apt to be feared, and to produce a silence around him.
We all remember Macaulay and "his brilliant flashes of silence." We all know that there are
talkers so distinguished that you must not ask both of them to dinner on the same day lest
they silence each other, while we know others who bring to us just an average amount of tact,
facility of expression, geniality, and a pleasant gift at a quotation, a bit of repartee; such
a person we call a ready small- talker, a "most agreeable person," one who frightens nobody
and who has a great popularity. Suffer these glance break in-- ball, and you have a monotony. A

She may give a modest personal opinion, or narrate her own sensations at the opera, if she
can do so without egotism, and she should always show a desire to be answered. If music and
literature fail, let her try the subjects of dancing, polo-playing, and lawn-tennis. A very
good story was told of a bright New York girl and a very haw-haw-stupid Englishman at a Newport
dinner. The Englishman had said "Oh," and "Really," and "Quite so," to everything which this
bright girl had asked him, when finally, very tired and very angry, she said, "Were you ever
thrown in the hunting-field, and was your head hurt?" The man turned and gazed admiringly.
"Now you've got me," was the reply. And he talked all the rest of the dinner of his croppers.
Perhaps it may not be necessary or useful often to unlock so rich a r,pertoire as this; but
it was a very welcome relief to this young lady not to do all the talking during three hours.

After a first introduction there is, no doubt, some difficulty in starting a conversation.
The weather, the newspaper, the last accident, the little dog, the bric-...-brac, the love
of horses, etc., are good and unfailing resources, except that very few people have the readiness
to remember this wealth of subjects at once. To recollect a thing apropos of the moment is
the gift of ready-witted people alone, and how many remember, hours after, a circumstance which
would have told at that particular moment of embarrassment when one stood twiddling his hat,
and another twisted her handkerchief. The French call "l'esprit d'escalier"--the "wit of the
staircase"--the gift of remembering the good thing you might have said in the drawing-room,
just too late, as you go up-stairs. However, two new people generally overcome this moment
of embarrassment, and then some simple offer of service, such as, "Can I get you a chair?"
"Is that window too cold?" "Can I bring you some tea?" occurs, and then the small-talk follows.

The only curious part of this subject is that so little skill is shown by the average talker
in weaving facts and incidents into his treatment of subjects of everyday character, and that
he brings so little intelligence to bear on his discussion of them. It is not given to every
one to be brilliant and amusing, but, with a little thought, passing events may always give
rise to pleasant conversation. We have lately been visited by a succession of brilliant sunsets,
concerning which there have been various theories. This has been a charming subject for conversation,
yet at the average dinner we have heard but few persons mention this interesting topic. Perhaps
one is afraid to start a conversation upon celestial scenery at a modern dinner. The things
may seem too remote, yet it would not be a bad idea.

Gossip may promote small-talk among those who are very intimate and who live in a narrow circle.
But how profoundly uninteresting is it to an outsider!--how useless to the real man or woman
of the world! That is, unless it is literary, musical, artistic gossip. Scandal ruins conversation,
and should never be included even in a definition of small-talk. Polite, humorous, vivacious,
speculative, dry, sarcastic, epigrammatic, intellectual, and practical people all meet around
a dinner-table, and much agreeable small-talk should be the result. It is unfortunately true
that there is sometimes a failure in this respect. Let a hostess remember one thing: there
is no chance for vivacity of intellect if her room is too warm; her flowers and her guests
will wilt together. There are those also who prefer her good dishes to talking, and the old
gentleman in Punch who rebuked his lively neighbor for talking while there were "such entr,es
coming in" has his counterparts among ourselves.

Some shy talkers have a sort of empirical way of starting a subject with a question like this:
"Do you know the meaning and derivation of the term 'bric-...-brac?'" "Do you believe in ghosts?"
"What do you think of a ladies' club?" "Do you believe in chance?" "Is there more talent displayed
in learning the violin than in playing a first-rate game of chess?" etc.

These are intellectual conundrums, and may be repeated indefinitely where the person questioned
is disposed to answer. With a flow of good spirits and the feeling of case which comes from
a knowledge of society, such questions often bring out what Margaret Fuller called "good talk."

But if your neighbor says "Oh," "Really," "Indeed," "I don't know," then the best way is to
be purely practical, and talk of the chairs and tables, and the existing order of things, the
length of trains, or the shortness of the dresses of the young ladies at the last ball, the
prevailing idea that "ice-water is unhealthy," and other such extremely easy ideas. The sound
of one's own voice is generally very sweet in one's own ears; let every lady try to cultivate
a pleasant voice for those of other people, and also an agreeable and accurate pronunciation.
The veriest nothings sound well when thus spoken. The best way to learn how to talk is, of
course, to learn how to think: from full wells one brings up buckets full of clear water, but
there can be small-talk without much thought. The fact remains that brilliant thinkers and
scholars are not always good talkers, and there is no harm in the cultivation of the art of
conversation, no harm in a little "cramming," if a person is afraid that language is not his
strong point. The merest trifle generally suffices to start the flow of small-talk, and the
person who can use this agreeable weapon of society is always popular and very much courted.

CHAPTER XXXIX. GARDEN-PARTIES.

Many of our correspondents ask us, "What shall we order for a garden-party?" We must answer
that the first thing to order is a fine day. In these fortunate days the morning revelations
of Old Probabilities give us an almost exact knowledge of what of rain or sunshine the future
has in store.

A rain or tornado which starts from Alaska, where the weather is made nowadays, will almost
certainly be here on the third day; so the hostess who is willing to send a hasty bidding can
perhaps avoid rain. It is the custom, however, to send invitations for these garden-parties
a fortnight before they are to occur. At Newport they are arranged weeks beforehand, and if
the weather is bad the entertainment takes place in-doors.

When invitations are given to a suburban place to which people are expected to go by rail or
any public means of conveyance, a card should also be sent stating the hours at which trains
leave, which train or boat to take, and any other information that may add to the comfort of
the guest. These invitations are engraved, and printed on note-paper, which should be perfectly
plain, or bear the family crest in water-mark only, and read somewhat as follows:

Mr. and Mrs. Edwin Smith request the pleasure of Mr. and Mrs. Conway Brown's company on Tuesday,
the thirtieth of July, at four o'clock.

Garden Party. 		Yonkers, New York.

Then, on the card enclosed, might be printed,

Carriages will meet the 3.30 train from Grand Central Depot.

If the invitation is to a country place not easy of access, still more explicit directions
should be given.

The garden-party proper is always held entirely in the open air. In England the refreshments
are served under a marquee in the grounds, and in that inclement clime no one seems to think
it a hardship if a shower of rain comes down, and ruins fine silks and beautiful bonnets. But
in our fine sunshiny land we are very much afraid of rain, and our malarious soil is not considered
always safe, so that the thoughtful hostess often has her table in-doors, piazzas filled with
chairs, Turkey rugs laid down on the grass, and every preparation made that the elderly and
timid and rheumatic may enjoy the garden-party without endangering their health.

A hostess should see that her lawn-tennis ground is in order, the croquet laid out, and the
archery tools all in place, so that her guests may amuse themselves with these different games.
Sometimes balls and races are added to these amusements, and often a platform is laid for dancing,
if the turf be not sufficiently dry. A band of musicians is essential to a very elegant and
successful garden- party, and a varied selection of music, grave and gay, should be rendered.
Although at a dinner-party there is reason to fear that an orchestra may be a nuisance, at
a garden-party the open air and space are sufficient guarantees against this danger.

If the hostess wishes her entertainment to be served out-of-doors, of course all the dishes
must be cold. Salads, cold birds, and ham, tongue, and pft, de foie gras, cold pft,s, and salmon
dressed with a green sauce, jellies, Charlottes, ices, cakes, punch, and champagne, are the
proper things to offer. A cup of hot tea should be always ready in the house for those who
desire it.

At a garden-party proper the hostess receives out on the lawn, wearing her hat or bonnet, and
takes it for granted that the party will be entirely out-of-doors. The carriages, however,
drive up to the door, and the ladies can go up-stairs and deposit their wraps and brush off
the dust, if they wish. A servant should be in attendance to show the guests to that part of
the grounds in which the lady is receiving.

At Newport these parties are generally conducted on the principle of an afternoon tea, and
after the mistress of the house has received her guests, they wander through the grounds, and,
when weary, return to the house for refreshment. Pft, de foie gras, sandwiches, cold birds,
plates of delicious jellied tongue, lobster salad, and sometimes hot cakes and hot broiled
chicken, are served at these high teas. Coffee and tea and wine are also offered, but these
are at mixed entertainments which have grown out of the somewhat unusual hours observed at
Newport in the season.

There is a sort of public garden-party in this country which prevails on semi-official occasions,
such as the laying of a foundation-stone for a public building, the birthday of a prominent
individual, a Sunday-school festival, or an entertainment given to a public functionary. These
are banquets, and for them the invitations are somewhat general, and should be officially issued.
For the private garden-party it is proper for a lady to ask for an invitation for a friend,
as there is always plenty of room; but it should also be observed that where this request is
not answered affirmatively, offence should not be taken. It is sometimes very difficult for
a lady to understand why her request for an invitation to her friend is refused; but she should
never take the refusal as a discourtesy to herself. There may be reasons which cannot be explained.

Ladies always wear bonnets at a garden-party, and the sensible fashion of short dresses has
hitherto prevailed; but it is rumored that a recent edict of the Princess of Wales against
short dresses at her garden-parties will find followers on this side of the water, notably
at Newport, which out-Herods Herod in its respect to English fashions.

Indeed, a long dress is very pretty on the grass and under the trees. At Buckingham Palace
a garden-party given to the Viceroy of Egypt several years ago presented a very Watteau-like
picture. Worth's handsomest dresses were freely displayed, and the lovely grounds and old trees
at the back of the palace were in fine full dress for the occasion.

In fact, England is the land for garden-parties, with its turf of velvet softness, its flowing
lime-trees, its splendid old oaks, and its finished landscape gardening. There are but few
places as yet in America which afford the clipped-box avenues, the arcades of blossoming rose-vines,
the pleached alleys, the finely kept and perfect gravel-walks, or, Better than all, the quiet,
old-fashioned gardens, down which the ladies may walk, rivals of the flowers.

But there are some such places; and a green lawn, a few trees, a good prospect, a fine day,
and something to eat, are really all the absolute requirements for a garden-party. In the neighborhood
of New York very charming garden-parties have been given: at the Brooklyn Navy-yard and the
camp of the soldier, at the head-quarters of the officers of marines, and at the ever-lovely
Governor's Island.

Up the Hudson, out at Orange (with its multitudinous pretty settlements), all along the coast
of Long Island, the garden-party is almost imperatively necessary. The owner of a fine place
is expected to allow the unfortunates who must stay in town at least one sniff of his roses
and new-mown hay.

Lawn-tennis has had a great share in making the garden-party popular; and in remote country
places ladies should learn how to give these parties, and, with very little trouble, make the
most of our fine climate. There is no doubt that a little awkwardness is to be overcome in
the beginning, for no one knows exactly what to do. Deprived of the friendly shelter of a house,
guests wander forlornly about; but a graceful and ready hostess will soon suggest that a croquet
or lawn-tennis party be formed, or that a contest at archery be entered upon, or that even
a card-party is in order, or that a game of checkers can be played under the trees.

Servants should be taught to preserve the proprieties of the feast, if the meal be served under
the trees. There should be no piles of dishes, knives, forks, or spoons, visible on the green
grass; baskets should be in readiness to carry off everything as soon as used. There should
be a sufficient quantity of glass and china in use, and plenty of napkins, so that there need
be no delay. The lemonade and punch bowls should be replenished from the dining-room as soon
as they show signs of depletion, and a set of neat maid- servants can be advantageously employed
in watching the table, and seeing that the cups, spoons, plates, wine-glasses, and forks are
in sufficient quantity and clean. If tea is served, maid-servants are better than men, as they
are careful that the tea is hot, and the spoons, cream, and sugar forthcoming. Fruit is an
agreeable addition to a garden-party entertainment, and pines, melons, peaches, grapes, strawberries,
are all served in their season. Pains should be taken to have these fruits of the very best
that can be obtained.

Claret-cup, champagne-cup, and soda-water, brandy and shandy-gaff, are provided on a separate
table for the gentlemen; Apollinaris water, and the various aerated waters so fashionable now,
are also provided. Although gentlemen help themselves, it is necessary to have a servant in
attendance to remove the wine-glasses, tumblers, and goblets as they are used, and to replenish
the decanters and pitchers as they are emptied, and to supply fresh glasses. Many hospitable
hosts offer their guests old Madeira, sherry, and port.

The decanters are placed on the regular luncheon-table, and glasses of wine are carried by
servants, on silver trays, to the ladies who are sitting on the piazzas and under the trees.
Small thin tumblers are used for the claret and champagne cup, which should be held in silver
or glass pitchers.

If strawberries and cream are served, a small napkin should be put between the saucer and plate,
and a dessert spoon and fork handed with each plate.

The servants who carry about refreshments from the tent or the table where they are served
should be warned to be very careful in this part of the service, as many a fine gown has been
spoiled, by a dish of strawberries and cream or a glass of punch or lemonade being overturned,
through a servant's want of care.

Ices are now served at garden-parties in small paper cups placed on ice-plates--a fashion which
is very neat, and which saves much of the mussiness which has heretofore been a feature of
these entertainments. Numbers of small tables should be brought with the camp-stools, and placed
at convenient intervals, where the guests can deposit their plates.

A lady should not use her handsome glass or china at these al fresco entertainments. It is
sure to be broken. It is better to hire all the necessary glass, silver, and china from the
caterer, as it saves a world of counting and trouble.

No doubt the garden-party is a troublesome affair, particularly if the refreshments are out-of-doors,
but it is very beautiful and very amusing, and worth all the trouble. It is just as pleasant,
however, if the table is in-doors.

CHAPTER XL. SILVER WEDDINGS AND OTHER WEDDING ANNIVERSARIES.

A very sensible reform is now being attempted in the matter of silver weddings. It was once
a demand on the purse of at least fifty dollars to receive an invitation to a silver wedding,
because every one was expected to send a piece of silver. Some very rich houses in New York
are stocked with silver with the elaborate inscription, "Silver Wedding." To the cards of to-day
is appended, "No presents received," which is a relief to the impecunious.

These cards are on plain white or silver-gray paper, engraved in silver letters, with the name
of the lady as she was known before marriage appended below that of her husband; the date of
the marriage is also added below the names.

The entertainment for a silver wedding, to be perfect, should occur at exactly the hour at
which the marriage took place; but as that has been found to be inconvenient, the marriage
hour is ignored, and the party takes place in the evening generally, and with all the characteristics
of a modern party. The "bridal pair" stand together, of course, to receive, and as many of
the original party of the groomsmen and bridesmaids as can be got together should be induced
to form a part of the group. There can be no objection to the sending of flowers, and particular
friends who wish can, of course, send other gifts, but there should be no obligation. We may
say here that the custom of giving bridal gifts has become an outrageous abuse of a good idea.
From being a pretty custom which had its basis in the excellent system of our Dutch ancestors,
who combined to help the young couple by presents of bed and table linen and necessary table
furniture and silver, it has now sometimes degenerated into a form of ostentation, and is a
great tax on the friends of the bride. People in certain relations to the family are even expected
to send certain gifts. It has been known to be the case that the bride allowed some officious
friend to suggest that she should have silver, or pearls, or diamonds; and a rich old bachelor
uncle is sure to be told what is expected from him. But when a couple have reached their silver
wedding, and are able and willing to celebrate it, it may be supposed that they are beyond
the necessity of appealing to the generosity of their friends; therefore it is a good custom
to have this phrase added to the silver-wedding invitation, "No presents received."

The question has been asked if the ceremony should be performed over again. We should say decidedly
not, for great danger has accrued to thoughtless persons in thus tampering with the wedding
ceremony. Any one who has read Mrs. Oliphant's beautiful story of "Madonna Mary" will be struck
at once with this danger. It is not safe, even in the most playful manner, to imitate that
legal form on which all society, property, legitimacy, and the safety of home hang.

Now as to the dress of the bride of twenty-five years, we should say, "Any color but black."
There is an old superstition against connecting black with weddings. A silver gray, trimmed
with steel and lace, has lately been used with much success as a second bridal dress. Still
less should the dress be white; that has become so canonized as the wedding dress of a virgin
bride that it is not even proper for a widow to wear it on her second marriage. The shades
of rose-color, crimson, or those beautiful modern combinations of velvet and brocade which
suit so many matronly women, are all appropriate silver-wedding dresses.

Ladies should not wear jewelry in the morning, particularly at their own houses; so if the
wedding is celebrated in the morning, the hostess should take care not to be too splendid.

Evening weddings are, in these anniversaries, far more agreeable, and can be celebrated with
more elaborate dressing. It is now so much the fashion to wear low-necked dresses (sleeveless
dresses were worn by bridesmaids at an evening wedding recently) that the bride of twenty-five
years can appear, if she chooses, in a low-cut short- sleeved dinner dress and diamonds in
the evening. As for the groom, he should be in full evening dress, immaculate white tie, and
pearl- colored kid gloves. He plays, as he does at the wedding, but a secondary part. Indeed,
it has been jocosely said that he sometimes poses as a victim. In savage communities and among
the birds it is the male who wears the fine clothes; in Christian society it is the male who
dresses in black, putting the fine feathers on his wife. It is to her that all the honors are
paid, he playing for the time but a secondary part. In savage communities she would dig the
earth, wait upon her lord, and stand behind him while he eats; in the modern silver wedding
he helps her to fried oysters and champagne, and stands while she sits.

Now as to who shall be invited. A correspondent writes asking if a silver wedding celebrated
in a new home would not be a good opportunity for making the "first onset of hospitality,"
inviting those neighbors who were not known before, or at least who were not visiting acquaintances.
We should think it a very happy idea. It is a compliment to ask one's friends and neighbors
to any ceremony or anniversary in which our own deep feelings are concerned, such as a christening,
a child's wedding, and the celebration of a birthday. Why not still more when a married pair
have weathered the storms of twenty-five years? People fully aware of their own respectability
should never be afraid to bow first, speak first, or call first. Courtesy is the most cosmopolitan
of good qualities, and politeness is one of the seven capital virtues. No people giving such
an invitation need be hurt if it is received coldly. They only thus find out which of their
new neighbors are the most worth cultivating. This sort of courtesy is as far as possible from
the dreadful word "pushing." As dress was made to dignify the human body, so a generous courtesy
clothes the mind. Let no one be afraid of draping the spirit with this purple and gold.

And in all fresh neighborhoods the new-comers should try to cultivate society. There is something
in its attrition which stimulates the mind. Society brightens up the wits, and causes the dullest
mind to bring its treasures to the surface.

The wedding anniversaries seem to begin with the fifth one--the wooden wedding. Here unique
and appropriate presents seem to be very cheap. Cedar tubs and bowls and pails, wooden baskets
filled with flowers, Shaker rocking-chairs and seats for the veranda, carved tables, cabinets
of oak, wall brackets, paintings on wood, water- colors framed in wood-carvings in bog oak,
and even a load of kindling wood, have been acceptably offered. The bride can dress as gayly
as she pleases at this early anniversary. Then comes the tin wedding, which now is very much
welcomed for the pretty tin candlesticks that it brings, fresh from London furnishers.

We hear of gorgeous silver weddings in California, that land of gold and silver, where the
display of toilettes each represented a large fortune.

The golden wedding is a rare festivity--the great marriage bell made of wheat fully ripe; sheaves
of corn; roses of the pure gold-color (the Marshal Niel is the golden-wedding flower par excellence).
We can well imagine the parlors beautifully decorated with autumn leaves and evergreens, the
children grouped about the aged pair, perhaps even a great-grandchild as a child bridesmaid,
a bridal bouquet in the aged white hand. We can fancy nothing more poetical and pathetic than
this festivity. 

And hence we may presume that there will ever be this order. It occupy the talker and an Iodine-131
can state her to you what i could not first have said to myself.
"the ocean of upturned confront," as Judge Webster state, adopt the
nominal, nevertheless, from Scott'mho "Rob Roy"-- "the water of purple
confront do moiety."

Dean retainer is merely, accommodate the facility as postdate: "affectionately
beloved Roger, although the Bible moveth thee and me in a spot,"
etc.; but utterance he recognize her a hearing.

It has, both upon alliterator, this favor. Of his "Religion Blighty" he yield the section to "the
Conveniency of she-Body." (i is not formerly cite down Body, and it was not impeach of make it away.)

but philosophy is glad to postulate with, glad ne'er to study-- and

The char is tied to endure; but char may lift to high that the stormy

To whom do you travel for lawyer? To disposition, no uncertainty; but
ne'er phlegmatic-yet laid to aplomb who are composure because they
cognize no good (like the Ruskin "to cowslip is really accurately
throws the plate because he does not hate it").

You travel the who have contend for aplomb, who have cognize what it is upon frisson, but have set
through whatever they have occupy in extremity.


CHAPTER XLI. SPRING AND SUMMER ENTERTAINMENTS.

As the season advances and the country bursts into glorious sudden spring, the garden party,
the country dinner, the horseback excursions, and the asparagus parties, the hunts and the
yacht voyages, the lawn-tennis and archery, the visits to the polo ground, and the delights
of a visit to the friends who live within an hour of the city, at Orange and at Morristown,
on the seagirt shore of Long Island or up the Hudson, begin to loom up before the city-bound
worthy, and to throw a "rose hue o'er his russet cares."

Now the first question with the neophyte who would go to the hunts (for they "break the ice"
in more senses than one), as the first of the spring out-of-door entertainments, is, What does
a young girl require who would "ride to hounds"? for "pale Diana," chaste and fair, no longer
hunts on foot, as she did in the days of Acteon.

She must have two thorough-bred hunters. She must have a groom, an English habit, a carefully-considered
outfit, and she must be a perfect and a fearless horsewoman, and not mind a "cropper." One
of the young riders at the Meadow Brook Hunt was thrown over her horse's head into a ditch
last spring, and got up declaring she was not even bruised. Yes, she must learn even how to
fall off her horse without breaking her ribs or her nose. It is an expensive amusement to be
Diana nowadays. The result, however, of long practice on horseback seems to be that a woman
becomes almost a centaur, and more fearless than a man. Then the hunt includes as its adjuncts
to the young ladies certain men in pink. They "form" on a roadside, and the master of the hunt
says, "Ladies and gentlemen, will you hunt?" and he motions to the whipper-in--a gallant creature
in pink also-- to "throw off the dogs."

Then the prettiest forty dogs, all spotted, start on their mad career. It is a beautiful sight,
with the red-coated huntsmen following, and it looks as if the real fox would be attainable
after a time, instead of the farce of an anise-seed bag which now serves to make the ghost
of a scent. The low, soft hat is a favorite with our young riders, but there is this to say
for the hard hat, it does break a fall. Many a fair forehead has been saved from a terrible
scar by the resistant hard hat.

The habit of riding every day and of getting thoroughly accustomed to one's seat should precede
the daring attempt at a break-neck "jump." No one should pretend to hunt who has not a good
seat, a good horse, and plenty of nerve. Much less should an incompetent rider venture on a
friend's horse. It has been said in England that "a man will forgive you for breaking his own
neck, but not that of his favorite hunter."

As the day for driving has come, many correspondents write to ask what is the best style of
equipage for a young man. We can only say that a tilbury and one horse is very showy, that
a dog-cart is the most "knowing," that a high chariot is very stately, but that the two-seated
Park wagon is the most appropriate in which to take out a lady. There should always be a servant
behind. The art of driving is simple enough, but requires much practice. The good driver should
understand his horse well, and turn his curves gently and slowly; he must know how to harness
and unharness a horse, and be ready to mend any trifling disarrangement if there is a break.

Now as to driving in a carriage with ladies, a correspondent writes to ask the etiquette which
should govern a gentleman's conduct. He takes his seat with his back to the horses, opposite
the ladies, nor should he assume to sit beside a lady unless requested to do so. When the carriage
stops, he should jump out and assist her to alight, walking with her up her own steps, and
ringing the bell. In entering the carriage he should put his left foot on the step, and enter
the carriage with his right foot. This is, however, supposing that he sits facing the horses;
if he sits with his back to the horses, he reverses the process. A gentleman should avoid treading
on ladies' dresses, or shutting them in the door. Ladies who have country-houses should learn
to drive as well as to ride. Indeed, in these days when young women drive alone in the Park
in their pony phaetons and little carts, we need hardly advise that they should learn to drive
well.

As to boating, which is practised so largely by men, we hear of but few ladies who pull the
oar about New York; but doubtless it will be done on inland streams and lakes. One gentleman
should stay in the boat and help to steady it, unless the oarswomen are very expert. Short
dresses and round hats should be worn, with no superincumbent drapery, As the seat of honor
in a boat is that occupied by the stroke oar, it is etiquette for the owner of the boat to
offer it to his friend if he be a rower.

The asparagus party is a sort of a long picnic, in which a party of friends join, and drive
or ride out to some convenient inn where a good dinner can be served, with the advantage of
the early vegetable cut directly from the ground. As Long Island is famous for its asparagus,
these parties from New York generally select some convenient locality there, near enough to
the city to be not too fatiguing a drive.

The new passion for driving a coach has now become so much of an American taste that we need
not describe the pastime here. At least four coaches will start from New York for some neighboring
town-New Rochelle, Yonkers, etc.--during the summer, and there is no better way of spending
a May day than on top of one. As for al fresco entertainments, game pie, patties, cold beef,
pressed tongue, potted meats, sandwiches, pft, de foie gras, champagne, are all taken out in
hampers, and served on top of the coach by the obedient valets at the races, for those parties
who go out with four horses and a London coach to see the favorite run.

We are often asked what would be the appropriate costume for a lawn party, and we can only
answer that the costumes for these parties should be of a useful character. If it is a lawn
party at a very elegant house, at Newport or up the Hudson, it may be, however, of a delicacy
and elegance not proper if one is asked out in the country merely to "have a good time," when
a person would be exposed to the weather, the wear and tear of games, and of a long day in
the sun, Thick boots are indispensable. But if one is invited to a wedding in the country,
even if the "lawn" is to play a decided part in the entertainment, one must dress very handsomely.
At the regular lawn party the lady of the house and her daughters should receive on the lawn
in their bonnets.

Yachting is a favorite "summer entertainment," and for those who love the sea it is unparalleled
for its excitement, Yachting dresses should be made of serge or tweed, and possess warmth and
durability, and young women can trim them according to taste with the name and insignia of
their favorite yacht.

For a lawn-tennis party the players dress in flannels made for the purpose, and for a lady
the jersey is indispensable, as giving so much freedom to the arms. These parties begin in
May at all the country-houses and country parks about our larger towns, and certainly furnish
as much healthful amusement as anything can do.

Archery has not yet become acclimated in America, but there are clubs in certain circles which
promise a future for this game.

Now for those who go to country-houses to stay "over Sunday," as is the fashion about New York,
let us give one word of advice. Always hold yourself at the disposal of those at whose house
you are staying. If they propose a plan of action for you, fall in with it. If your visit is
prolonged for a week, endeavor to amuse yourself as much as possible. Do not let your hostess
see that you are dependent on her for amusement. Remember, however welcome you may be, you
are not always wanted. A good hostess also learns when to let her guests alone. A gentleman
visitor who neither shoots, fishes, boats, reads, writes letters, nor does anything but hang
about, letting himself be "amused," is an intolerable nuisance. He had better go to the billiard-room
and practice caroms by himself, or retire to the stables and smoke.

A lady visitor should show a similar tact in retiring to her own room to read or write letters,
allowing her hostess to have her mornings or her afternoons to herself, as she pleases. Some
people are "born visitors." They have the genius of tact to perceive, the genius of finesse
to execute, case and frankness of manner, a knowledge of the world that nothing can surprise,
a calmness of temper that nothing can disturb, and a kindness of disposition that can never
be exhausted. Such a visitor is greatly in demand everywhere.

A good-natured host and hostess place everything at the disposal of a visitor--their horses,
carriages, books, and grounds. And here the utmost delicacy should be observed. Never ride
a horse too fast or too far. Never take the coachman beyond his usual limits. Never pluck a
flower in the ornamental grounds without asking permission, for in these days of ornamental
and fanciful gardening it is necessary to be careful and remember that each flower is a tint
in a well-considered picture. Never dog's-ear or disfigure the books, or leave them lying about;
if you take them from their shelves, put them back. Be thoughtful in your treatment of the
servants, and give those who immediately wait upon you some small gratuity. And if family prayers
are read, always try to be present.

So much for the possibility of a "summer entertainment" at a country-house, one of the most
agreeable of all, if the apple- blossoms are just out, and the charm of spring is over the
whole scene.

We hear of a "rustic masquerade" as one of the spring entertainments at a country-house in
Orange. This, it would seem, might be very suitable all over the country, if woods and water
are near enough for the shepherds and shepherdesses. A copy of the garden parties which made
Boucher the painter that he was, and in which we almost hear the wind rustling through the
sedge, the refreshing murmur of the fountain, and see the gayly dressed marquise put her violet
slipper on the turf, and the elegant and stately gentlemen as they light up the neighboring
arbor with their fine silk coats in his pictures--a copy of such garden parties as those which
made Watteau's fame (he has put them all on the fans, and the young people have only to copy
them)--this would indeed be a "rustic masquerade," which might amuse and "draw" for a charity.
Many of our country towns on the borders of lakes, many of the places near New York in their
own fine grounds, would offer a terrestrial paradise for such a garden party.

To drive out to Jerome Park to breakfast, to get the early strawberry and the delicious cream--this
is a spring entertainment which many of our business men indulge in, coming back to their work
in New York refreshed and invigorated. The men of pleasure of this period have, as they have
always had, an ample provision of amusement--not always the most useful, it is true--yet we
are glad to see that the out-of-door excitements begin to distance the excitements of the gaming-table.
Betting on the turf is not carried to the ruinous extent here that it is in England, while
the polo, the base-ball, the boating, and the "riding to hounds "--open to ridicule as it is,
in some ways of looking at it--are all healthful. The spring season has its little dinners,
lunches, and weddings, but very few evening entertainments.

After a young girl has ransacked the fashionable world all winter, and been at all the f^tes
and balls, concerts, operas, and suppers, she does not care for parties in May. Such infatuated
ardor for amusement would make sad havoc of her charms if she did. It is quite enough if she
finishes her exciting winter with a fancy dance or private theatricals at some charitable entertainment.

A high tea is served in courses like a dinner, excepting with less formality. The lady sits
at one end of the table with the silver tea-tray before her, while the gentleman has before
him cold chicken, or even, perhaps, a hot dish like roast partridges, to carve. Frequently
scalloped oysters are passed, and always salads, so that those who are in the habit of dining
at that hour have a solid meal. There are hot cakes and biscuits and sweetmeats on the table,
so that it is really the old-fashioned tea of our grandmothers re-enforced by some solid dishes.
It is intended to save the servants trouble on Sunday evening, but it is really more trouble
to them as now served, as it gives the waiter additional dishes to wash, and quite as much
service. It saves the cook, however.

CHAPTER XLII. FLORAL TRIBUTES AND DECORATIONS.

When every steamer leaving these shores goes out laden with people who are weighed down with
flowers, it cannot but be a severe tax on the ingenuity of the florist to devise novel and
appropriate forms for the typical basket that shall say bon voyage in a thousand new ways.
Floral ships, anchors, stars, crosses, mottoes, monograms, and even the national flag, have
been used for these steamer decorations.

But the language of flowers, so thoroughly understood among the Persians that a single flower
expresses a complete declaration of love, an offer of marriage, and, presumably, a hint at
the settlement, is, with our more practical visionaries and enthusiasts of the nineteenth century,
rather an echo of the stock market than a poetical fancy. We fear that no prima donna looks
at her flowers without a thought of how much they have cost, and that the belle estimates her
bouquet according to the commercial value of a lily- of-the-valley as compared with that of
a Jacqueminot rose, rather than as flowers simply. It is a pity that the overwhelming luxury
of an extravagant period involves in its all-powerful grasp even the flowers of the field,
those generous gifts of sunshine and of rain.

But so it is. It is a well-known fact that the lady who will give her order three months in
advance for the flowers needed for her daughter's wedding, or for any other grand ceremonial,
can, by offering a sufficiently large amount of money, command any flower she wishes. Even
daisies and buttercups, red clover and white, the delicate forget-me-not of the garden, nasturtiums
and marigolds, the shy and tender anemone, the dandelion and lilacs and lilies-of-the- valley,
may be forced into unnatural bloom in January. It is a favorite caprice to put the field-flowers
of June on a lunch-table in January.

This particular table is the greatest of all the consumers of flowers, therefore we may begin
by describing some of the new fancies developed by that extraordinarily luxurious meal. A lady's
lunch must show not only baskets of magnificent flowers up and down the table; but it must
also bear a basket or a bouquet for each lady.

One of the most regal lunches, given to twenty-eight ladies, set the fashion for using little
gilt baskets, with covers opening on either side of the handle--the kind of basket, of a larger
size, in which, in New England and in Old England, Dame Trot carried her multifarious parcels
home from market. These pretty and useful baskets had on each side a bunch of flowers peeping
out through the open cover, and on the gilt handle was tied a ribbon corresponding in color
to the flowers. One of them, having soft pink rosebuds of exceeding size and loveliness on
one side and a bunch of lilies-of- the-valley on the other, with a bow of pink satin ribbon
on the handle, was as pretty a picture as ever Kate Greenaway devised. Another, showing the
strong contrast of purple pansies and yellow daffodils, and tied with a lovely purple satin
ribbon, was a dream of rich color. 

Vienna, Alsen. 15, 1773.
We are rather well, know themselves of Iron; of occasion that we
have contrived in clip to write to you, although we have somewhere
remind a agency to do. We hope you so are very. Dr. Niderl s us well
be much. Repetition of a favorite
idea in flowers is not ugly, although it seems at first very far from the primeval and delicious
confusion in which nature throws her bouquets down upon upland and meadow.

In the arrangement of roses the most varied and whimsical fancies may be displayed, although
the most gorgeous effect is produced, perhaps, by massing a single color or group. A basket
of the pink Gloire de Paris, however, with its redundant green foliage, alternated with deep-red
Jacqueminots, is a very splendid fancy, and will fill a room with fragrance. In February these
roses cost two dollars apiece, and it was no rare sight to see four or six baskets, each containing
forty roses, on one table during the winter of 1884.

We advise all ladies going into the country to purchase some of the little "Dame Trot" baskets,
as they will be lovely when filled with wild-flowers during the summer. Indeed, the gilt basket,
fitted with a tin pan to hold earth or water, is such a cheap and pretty receptacle for either
growing or cut flowers that it ought to be a belonging of every dinner-table.

From the lunch-table, with its baskets and floral fancies, we come to the dinner-table. Here
the space is so valuable that the floral bag, an ingenious plan by which roses may be hung
at the side of the wearer, has been invented. This is a novel and very pretty way of wearing
flowers. The roses or other flowers are tied together with wires, in the shape of a reticule,
and a ribbon and pin provided, so that the lady may fasten her floral trophy at her side. The
baskets of flowers and the adornments of the ,pergne for a dinner are very apt to be all of
one flower. If mixed, they are of two sorts, as yellow roses and red ones, or white and pink,
or, may be, half of lilacs and half of roses, or purple pansies and bright yellow flowers.
Some tables are set with scarlet carnations alone, and the effect is very fine.

For wedding decorations, houses are now filled with palm-trees in pots and orange-trees in
full bearing. An entire suite of rooms is made into a bower of large-leaved plants. Mirrors
are covered with vines, wreaths, and climbing roses, trained across a trellis of wire. The
bride stands under a floral umbrella, which juts out into the room. The monograms of bride
and bridegroom are put in floral shields against the wall, like the cartouche on which the
names and the titles of an Egyptian king are emblazoned in the solitude of the Pyramids. The
bouquets carried by brides and bridesmaids are now extraordinarily large, measuring a foot
or more across the top.

Tulips have always been favorite ornaments for the dinner-table. These flowers, so fine in
drawing and so splendid in color, produce an extremely brilliant effect in large masses. As
Easter approaches, lilies come in for especial notice, and the deep Japan cup-lily, grouped
with the stately callas, and the garden-lily, with its long yellow stamens and rich perfume,
worthily fill the ,pergnes.

Hyacinths are lovely harbingers of spring, and are beautiful in color; but there is a strong
objection to this flower as a decoration, its heavy perfume being unpleasant to some people.

A fish-basket filled with bunches of lilies, mignonette, deep pink moss-roses shaded to the
pale tints of the rose known as the Baroness de Rothschild, with a glowing centre of warm red
Jacqueminots and a fringe of purple pansies and Mar,chal Niels, was one of many beautiful floral
ornaments on a magnificent dinner- table.

Although less effective than the artificial ones, they had a pretty appearance until they drooped
and faded. This adornment cost one hundred and fifty dollars.

A rainbow has been attempted in flowers, but with poor success. It will look like a ribbon--a
very handsome ribbon, no doubt; but the arc-en-ciel evades reproduction, even in the transcendent
prismatic colors of flowers.

Ribbons have been used with flowers, and add much to their effect; for, since the Arcadian
days of Rosalind and Celia, a flower, a ribbon, and a pretty girl, have been associated with
each other in prose, poetry, painting, and romance.

The hanging-baskets, filled with blooming plants, trailers, and ferns, have been much used
at weddings to add to the bower-like appearance of the rooms; and altars and steps of churches
have been richly adorned with flowering plants and palm-trees and other luxuriant foliage.

The prices paid for flowers have been enormous. One thousand dollars for the floral decorations
for a single dinner has not been an uncommon price. But the expenditure of such large sums
for flowers has not been unprofitable. The flowers grow finer every day, and, as an enterprising
florist, who had given a "rose tea" to his patrons, remarked, "Every large order inspires us
to produce a finer flower."

CHAPTER XLIII. THE FORK AND THE SPOON.

A correspondent writes, "How shall I carry my fork to my mouth?" The fork should be raised
laterally to the mouth with the right hand; the elbow should never be crooked, so as to bring
the hand round at a right angle, or the fork directly opposite the mouth. The mother cannot
begin too early to inculcate good manners at the table, and among the first things that young
children should learn is the proper use of the fork.

Again, the fork should not be overloaded. To take meat and vegetables and pack them on the
poor fork, as if it were a beast of burden, is a common American vulgarity, born of our hurried
way of eating at railway-stations and hotels. But it is an unhealthy and an ill-mannered habit.
To take but little on the fork at a time, a moderate mouthful, shows good manners and refinement.
The knife must never be put into the mouth at any time--that is a remnant of barbarism.

Another correspondent asks, "Should cheese be eaten with a fork?" We say, decidedly, "Yes,"
although good authorities declare that it may be put on a morsel of bread with a knife, and
thus conveyed to the mouth. Of course we refer to the soft cheeses--like Gorgonzola, Brie,
cream-cheese, Neufchatel, Limburger, and the like--which are hardly more manageable than butter.
Of the hard cheeses, one may convey a morsel to the month with the thumb and forefinger; but,
as a general rule, it is better to use the fork.

Now as to the spoon: it is to be used for soup, for strawberries and cream, for all stewed
fruit and preserves, and for melons, which, from their juiciness, cannot be conveniently eaten
with a fork. Peaches and cream, all the "wet dishes," as Mrs. Glasse was wont to call them,
must be eaten with a spoon. Roman punch is always eaten with a spoon.

On elegant tables, each plate or "cover" is accompanied by two large silver knives, a small
silver knife and fork for fish, a small fork for the oysters on the half-shell, a large table-spoon
for soup, and three large forks. The napkin is folded in the centre, with a piece of bread
in it. As the dinner progresses, the knife and fork and spoon which have been used are taken
away with the plate. This saves confusion, and the servant has not to bring fresh knives and
forks all the time. Fish should be eaten with silver knife and fork; for if it is full of bones,
like shad, for instance, it is very difficult to manage it without the aid of a knife.

For sweetbreads, cutlets, roast beef, etc., the knife is also necessary; but for the croquettes,
rissoles, bouch,es ... la Reine, timbales, and dishes of that class, the fork alone is needed.
A majority of the made dishes in which the French excel are to be eaten with the fork.

After the dinner has been eaten, and the dessert reached, we must see to it that everything
is cleared off but the table-cloth, which is now never removed. A dessert-plate is put before
each guest, and a gold or silver spoon, a silver dessert spoon and fork, and often a queer
little combination of fork and spoon, called an "ice-spoon."

In England, strawberries are always served with the green stems, and each one is taken up with
the fingers, dipped in sugar, and thus eaten. Many foreigners pour wine over their strawberries,
and then eat them with a fork, but this seems to be detrimental to the natural flavor of the
king of berries.

Pears and apples should be peeled with a silver knife, cut into quarters, and then picked up
with the fingers. Oranges should be peeled, and cut or separated, as the eater chooses. Grapes
should be eaten from behind the half-closed hand, the stones and skin falling into the fingers
unobserved, and thence to the plate. Never swallow the stones of small fruits; it is extremely
dangerous. The pineapple is almost the only fruit which requires both knife and fork.

So much has the fork come into use of late that a wit observed that he took everything with
it but afternoon tea. The thick chocolate, he observed, often served at afternoon entertainments,
could be eaten comfortably with a fork, particularly the whipped cream on top of it.

A knife and fork are both used in eating salad, if it is not cut up before serving. A large
lettuce leaf cannot be easily managed without a knife, and of course the fork must be used
to carry it to the mouth. Thus, as bread, butter, and cheese are served with the salad, the
salad knife and fork are really essential. Salt-cellars are now placed at each plate, and it
is not improper to take salt with your knife.

Dessert-spoons and small forks do not form a part of the original "cover;" that is, they are
not put on at the beginning of the dinner, but are placed before the guests according as they
are needed; as, for instance, when the Roman punch arrives before the game, and afterwards
when the plum-pudding or pastry is served before the ices.

The knives and forks are placed on each side of the plate, ready for the hand.

For the coffee after dinner a very small spoon is served, as a large one would be out of place
in the small cups that are used. Indeed, the variety of forks and spoons now in use on a well-furnished
table is astonishing.

One of our esteemed correspondents asks, "How much soup should be given to each person?" A
half-ladleful is quite enough, unless it is a country dinner, where a full ladleful may be
given without offence; but do not fill the soup-plate.

In carving a joint of fowl the host ought to make sure of the condition of both knife and fork.
Of course a good carver sees to both before dinner. The knife should be of the best cutlery,
well sharpened, and the fork long, strong, and furnished with a guard.

In using the spoon be very careful not to put it too far into the mouth. It is a fashion with
children to polish their spoons in a somewhat savage fashion, but the guest at a dinner-party
should remember, in the matter of the dessert-spoon especially (which is a rather large implement
for the mouth), not to allow even the clogging influences of cabinet pudding to induce him
to give his spoon too much leeway; as in all etiquette of the table, the spoon has its difficulties
and dangers. Particularly has the soup-spoon its Scylla and Charybdis, and if a careless eater
make a hissing sound as he eats his soup, the well-bred diner-out looks round with dismay.

There are always people happy in their fashion of eating, as in everything else. There is no
such infallible proof of good-breeding and of early usage as the conduct of a man or woman
at dinner. But, as every one has not had the advantage of early training, it is well to study
these minute points of table etiquette, that one may learn how to eat without offending the
sensibility of the well-bred. Especially study the fork and the spoon. There is, no doubt,
a great diversity of opinion on the Continent with regard to the fork. It is a common German
fashion, even with princes, to put the knife into the month. Italians are not always particular
as to its use, and cultivated Russians, Swedes, Poles, and Danes often eat with their knives
or forks indiscriminately.

But Austria, which follows French fashions, the Anglo-Saxon race in England, America, and the
colonies, all French people, and those elegant Russians who emulate French manners, deem the
fork the proper medium of communication between the plate and the mouth.

CHAPTER XLIV. NAPKINS AND TABLE-CLOTHS.
