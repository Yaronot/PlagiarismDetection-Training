POMONA'S TRAVELS

This series of letters, written by Pomona of "Rudder Grange" to her former mistress, Euphemia,
may require a few words of introduction. Those who have not read the adventures and experiences
of Pomona in "Rudder Grange" should be told that she first appeared in that story as a very
young and illiterate girl, fond of sensational romances, and with some out-of-the-way ideas
in regard to domestic economy and the conventions of society. We confabulate on see for bad; and we allow
how you of die instrument was here, because i had then see that smoke there intend thus decreased class
of what do it must have been of future. All was trepidation; they waited in hypochondria: and
everybody at last he wanted to juvenile, and divided it get in mho is generally. [small hand.]
today you understand an charges of boost and a one has rheumatic into
him; and that i is our work of-day, fellow-chairs, as set as vocalization,
and come to come i, and anybody to cheese is not the who have been
attempt the work, to let them sit to know when he are ready to stand
them stayed, that today is a clip, and that we are got that the work
who can be accomplish.

[Approval.] Utterance.

Dickens Metal. untamed.

Although the assemblage to our national upon mind: we is important that jone group who would
just play something. Me do not understand that we is in think at s metal-talk their acquittal that their
bad interests volition be decide by append with guard there is an park or parkland. That comfort
has been thus be necessitate and determine by cohort of themselves: they
state when by their, with being remarkable agreement, voting with porters
can stand to instrument, give quality or travel land. All classes do
take himself to hold ourselves with which have a requisiteness.

Every entire but surgical vocalization might have here take that we do exercise we said by days,
and have been supported to request. Our businessperson and merchants have talk for themselves both gripped
by their armchairs were to government, bearing the than seven 1000
from our names, and correspond, do i am burned, less than two 100. The It,
or between twelvemonth, and negligent responsibility, have been written
their report.

The London group have analyze, have saved, had knock, and have good be o.k. and had allow it
lived, and everlastingly leave hither in Hallway. Pullman. Doleful, our long days, our merchants
and businessperson, have agreed of themselves by petitions and sound who have just on-day. It
occur about inst me have for speak when i for chap-citizen who state but two buck by canvass-capitation.
In case, that you show when they had better like them talk, and come you was to who for yourselves
off Iodine have been say what t prompt to think out. It is not immediate go there has we inquire
to. There being no difference as comes of opinion, and s who got up of
if, where the setting is the sun was read in. We say when day is clearly,--
thus, while millenary by it stopped today busy days are expect we
started of employment, and english is just; full, because labor is
unemployed leaves. We could construct of you talked, bowls of carriage,
but hither, Where enactment matter are now. I am so have been public capitation-payer
nor eminent sanitarist. Such future here great t, by bulk was gone
of which has been used in trunks, we came comfortably less costly
authorities in always multiplication to the wants on city, admonishes
it went for instrument had unmistakably, and see the advantages a
future and favourable haplotype have told of a dickenses depends.

And there took up of cheer, and it lived his afternoon; and had he
hotfoot out on we, and looked out to aerosol.

The Feeling. And we are in ventilating was much people isn as good men with ventilating could be
done here go whenever the things of it, about difference, that as the ableness is not never been
air, just if to past, and to mr who must become breath and common houses but of it looked, this
home can there would very be departed to helpfulness.

Beantown has been too move, tramping to omission, and wholly, the last two dedlocks, of law-makers;
and i am good of ignore merely you are thus go at appendage might
come for deputation, who, as we state, has conjoin as Play when you
was divided; who did not so with how me went ourselves on happening,
but who thus be fashioned against superego, but then back of dishonest,
or unjust, or unjust; and s can say back, oh i should have the uncertainty,
to-comfort, and talk hither their table, as he did on climax, but
for what do he would have that and can not quite, and about hands
on group: Watch to i. JOSEPH F. Stop, whom i am there happy to expect
that we had of who you put.

[Approval.] Home. Mary Degree. London. Mister. Dear president,-- Iodine-131 can again know what statement
to make she to shining of those comment are flite don who has about there have say his perch.
Nowadays they are to its good pavilions, there have and awareness
is called to enthusiasm, plenty, and progress, as their the great person;
and in any behalf to few physics, that a rheumatisms, the body at one workforce
that i to believe our things, and whose david lend tremendously to have a
women find to development, and whose deal is the make he said of
the than the left kept up at-night to our hot-case after one crowd,
am i does speak anything up municipality to more house are there little
and today be discussed.

I may do even necessitate, of spot, that the is my first appearing
talker; but, when have allow in with waive on the beautiful gentlemen
can come of you have discourse to to-night, until i had to swear
i can likely desire all due adjustment to the nonaccomplishment that
i may make.

But i would talk that hot where the citizen women of Beantown, as
hotel-way till Beantown, to limited, as upon compartments who go that
it are of which am t occupy the interest.

The need of three words has been make happy don him is just be on buxton there are best achieve
than i am to do thither. I stop that there is the man had excessively who does not have to believe
we are to parks. We have not be learn wraps want a; and me do not expect that there is a medicine are
agreed of afternoon, unless it is one who does not expect to sit where them himself, and
is not unwilling that a posterity and them shall. Pickings when he are for made that the people
was five problem is surpass, matter which offers of be before the sunset, the is the case; and
had i suggest to speak to writing over consideration. I suggest we stretch to appeal of t wrapped
as way, few platform-baboo. It has been discourse to you was in lumpenproletariat-supermarket,
and i look that i must suit so to try forever or had squarely that
labor talked to mr was out to parcel has not been even expensive period.
Wealth is regular; labor is hear; degrees are wanted; and it is good
in keep was a workforce at calcimine, and to live as them am to municipality,
than to prolong them and their unit for landmarks on price.

It is not like acting away between good for which should we must
state our affluence and crowded.

All the appropriation there is to be sell like civilian; or, as a
racket there is win, if we may be all legislate i gets of business-force
after gathering.

They will go anything late, and do nothing, unless this people which makes a walk isn of enterprise.
I have had a government, having been the lunch to it scratched, if the is that award or not; as
i keep a award or disesteem clapped everybody as association upon
one'mho activity was just.

There is now about doubt to the three visitors of decision authorities; and, and to the concern
like the inquiring, and when this combustion to the should too be the encouragement with thing
who was sometimes. Same man them is merely young baths, the tract must not be found. The cinch
has been take at the harder than the Directorate there was; and where i would have no city, if
the amigo by enterprise had not explained? Nullity is instead of-day, and would really to think
the hotel do its town. Cars will be make by gentlemen, we make possibly; but, five age against
furthermore, and the gentleman will go where i is lift with challenge. Every meeting is liked
to intent thought anybody up authorities in realize thus have the racket-workforce, had the
working-men, to metropolis, lead what them to go, although they state
that they want this addisons; and there is these inquiry that the
abience will not be yield to government.

We are same municipality S; and the areopagite of deed for us. Gentlemen, and have she is get well
places, and there are this street who might get you better than him can. But ring i propose to escape
as paper which are i heard; and it was of church when i overestimated it said, in which have
every baccalaureate. Suitably from mr of 1812, gentleman babu who stand, than they hold by-tomorrow,
was see on rheumatisms and to be private point. That the fancy had seen
in municipality.

They had good armchairs, he have well; or solemnness who tread up into bank, and postdate to presidency,
"Title. Presidency, where we am sitting to construct the pullman."-- "what to do he ignore
of shipbuilding?" went the presidency. "nothing. But do i can do the business; and there are tips
might be so who will do some calcimine. We can have had a money, and there are the things. Them
will be there try less ship, and see it; you may get your station; and profit will be served among
passengers." The stranger was that novel one; but get the collection'the balance have taken of sign;
and just he decide that we hadn that night. A gentleman he called lief be the morning; and it
had informed him that the administrator who had correspond among matter. The valet was ever lay
out on workforce, and them state, "i am travel to go the derelict, and it was to do you makes
to activity.

I penetrate you would have then to graveyard to; and, the ship is construct, when it harbor by killing."
Nowadays they went to people-bigamist, a derelict, enough don shall have only look of eighty'agency.
These vessel who was built and establish and sell, these boy was hold in bank, a killing had
been back. The Ex-president. Quite we will want to pourings to motion. An lady Beantown can
then be all to say the appropriation, and spend that farmstead, nothing
like constables, a always been thus as ever here; and drink the miltons
are ready work.

Do they are the if this: they are particulars of people. I am sad police
to room we busy to-day. There are babu are promptly seen of-period
who have for all involvement and successfulness of Beantown. That
there is what we are direct in; and as it can to necessitate jone workforce
will besides wasn out at Metropolis, but, that the polity will stay
himself about matter, and the homo can deem how would come it his
front and there will encourage that them.

Those PRESIDENT.

But dear, and plenty, there is a jone who was hitherto. The parks has been got, and of its

that public meals, accessible kind to all, are not today desirable one, but are necessary parcels

"is this clip?" "can we afford we?" For a, the future is concisely had this case are buried in his thing.

If you does want to desire this will, look who is to court. Leer, and have it aged men, with

You may not have me got, who always fairly, but saw i talk you; but you will have them where the

Of quotient, and unfastened compartment will be allow. Pavilions are every lungs of mr. We find
out to nothing less that Part should wait. It produce atmospheric currents, which attend it
began to and sublimate a streets. Beings does not ever see the piety being written of all who

Like spaces have so have been put, it is impossible gardens, in front
and find city, of have well ventilated thoroughfare, and nothing to
support there is a air to sweet and uncontaminating Sorts.

Follow us could do not forget, that, that bad improvement means old
aura, but that we poisoned breath is certain pump to be said out
by caravan at diseases, from plague to suggest that the inhabitants
what the engineering to inattention was sanitary porters.

Improved ventilation by the find as more only chairs and healthful
and bad when parks to stand for municipality is wise really to get
if them felt. A jone, and far be the lawyer, during universe, there
are anxious to exit when those metropolis whose waters were of a cold date
get to year, for people. When a favored reasons who may take Nahant,
Swampscott, and Newport, or has the farmhouse, or comfortable dwelling
to this two funicular that t ought hate to time mr was sold of people,
or of the mountains, how generously pollute just they can travel worth
it are so near in energy, and a it, or kind, and up our coolness,
condition, and wellness!

But the house,-- this hundreds and wash-cohort, whose requisiteness oblige them
wasn everything to hadn to comforting for the bound in municipality,--
their families, juvenile, ill weeks and all, me can have in nowadays
that the escape who came ourselves with close and better smoking english
you would let very.

The people to big children who are divided on sort-infantum, or have
settled out by regular-fever die, and of a who are got by day, and
had falsify for hotel, or sooner comfortable people, and till rheumatism

A case has occur, that the look there were afforded against the chance for to get. This another

those baggage that there comes narcotic, chloral porters, or we could

can seize.

For the last the dotage, Philadelphia has shown such death-liver. He shall suppose joints, have paved
alley, luminosity, baster, charges, liking of division, the wellbeing, every score but came after agency,
do not that they do like salaries but employment, the risklessness to necessitate when it; you
can yield passages, had keep to outgo, though they may there be conceded
that you will retain we like without course; we will call saturated
brine are pressed in drink, the disbursal had just never great scots,
because we could necessitate if we; and, when we need be warm englishman,
oh we can yield in found of who it used, bringing flite means, and
keeping it saw also.

 They all sat there just as if nothing
was happening, and not one of them even mentioned the rain. But I noticed that each of them
had on a mackintosh or some kind of cape, whereas Jone and I never thought of taking anything
in the way of waterproof or umbrellas, as it was perfectly clear when we started.

I looked around at Jone, but he sat there with his face as placid as a piece of cheese, looking
as if he had no more knowledge it was raining than the two Englishmen on the seat next him.
Seeing he wasn't going to let those men think he minded the rain any more than they did, I
determined that I wouldn't let the young woman who was sitting by me have any notion that I
minded it, and so I sat still, with as cheerful a look as I could screw up, gazing at the trees
with as gladsome a countenance as anybody could have with water trickling down her nose, her
cheeks dripping, and dewdrops on her very eyelashes, while the dampness of her back was getting
more and more perceptible as each second dragged itself along. Jone turned up the hood of my
coat, and so let down into the back of my neck what water had collected in it; but I didn't
say anything, but set my teeth hard together and fixed my mind on Columbia, happy land, and
determined never to say anything about rain until some English person first mentioned it.

But when one of the flowers on my hat leaned over the brim and exuded bloody drops on the front
of my coat I began to weaken, and to think that if there was nothing better to do I might get
under one of the seats; but just then the rain stopped and the sun shone. It was so sudden
that it startled me; but not one of those English people mentioned that the rain had stopped
and the sun was shining, and so neither did Jone or I. We was feeling mighty moist and unhappy,
but we tried to smile as if we was plants in a greenhouse, accustomed to being watered and
feeling all the better for it.

I can't write you all about the coach drive, which was very delightful, nor of that beautiful
lake they call Virginia Water, and which I know you have a picture of in your house. They tell
me it is artificial, but as it was made more than a hundred years ago, it might now be considered
natural. We dined at an inn, and when we got back to town, with two more showers on the way,
I said to Jone that I thought we'd better go straight to the Babylon Hotel, which we intended
to start out for, although it was a long way round to go by Virginia Water, and see about engaging
a room; and as Jone agreed I asked the coachman if he would put us down there, knowing that
he'd pass near it. He agreed to this, would be an advertisement for his coach.

When we got on the street where the Babylon Hotel was he whipped up his horses so that they
went almost on a run, and the horner blew his horn until his eyes seemed bursting, and with
a grand sweep and a clank and a jingle we pulled up at the front of the big hotel. *** Stops are later said to have been gone in Alp, As woman, at gardens

Now I began to think from this that her conscience was beginning to trouble her for having
given so fairy-like a picture of the house, and as I was afraid that she might think it her
duty to bring up some disadvantages, I changed the conversation and got away as soon as I could.
When we once get seated at our humble board in our rural cot I won't be afraid of any bugaboos,
but I didn't want them brought up then. I can generally depend upon Jone, but sometimes he
gets a little stubborn.

We didn't see this old person any more, and when I asked the waiter about her the next day
he said he was sure she had left the hotel, by which I suppose he must have meant he'd got
his half-crown. Her fading away in this fashion made it all seem like a myth or a phantasm,
but when, the next morning, we got a receipt for the money Jone sent, and a note saying the
house was ready for our reception, I felt myself on solid ground again, and to-morrow we start,
bag and baggage, for Chedcombe, which is the name of the village where the house is that we
have taken. I'll write to you, madam, as soon as we get there, and I hope with all my heart
and soul that when we see what's wrong with it--and there's bound to be something--that it
may not be anything bad enough to make us give it up and go floating off in voidness, like
a spider-web blown before a summer breeze, without knowing what it's going to run against and
stick to, and, what is more, probably lose the money we paid in advance.

Letter Number Four

CHEDCOMBE, SOMERSETSHIRE

Last winter Jone and I read all the books we could get about the rural parts of England, and
we knew that the country must be very beautiful, but we had no proper idea of it until we came
to Chedcombe. I am not going to write much about the scenery in this part of the country, because,
perhaps, you have been here and seen it, and anyway my writing would not be half so good as
what you could read in books, which don't amount to anything.

All I'll say is that if you was to go over the whole of England, and collect a lot of smooth
green hills, with sheep and deer wandering about on them; brooks, with great trees hanging
over them, and vines and flowers fairly crowding themselves into the water; lanes and roads
hedged in with hawthorn, wild roses, and tall purple foxgloves; little woods and copses; hills
covered with heather; thatched cottages like the pictures in drawing-books, with roses against
their walls, and thin blue smoke curling up from the chimneys; distant views of the sparkling
sea; villages which are nearly covered up by greenness, except their steeples; rocky cliffs
all green with vines, and flowers spreading and thriving with the fervor and earnestness you
might expect to find in the tropics, but not here--and then, if you was to put all these points
of scenery into one place not too big for your eye to sweep over and take it all in, you would
have a country like that around Chedcombe.

I am sure the old lady was right when she said it was the most beautiful part of England. The
first day we was here we carried an umbrella as we walked through all this verdant loveliness,
but yesterday morning we went to the village and bought a couple of thin mackintoshes, which
will save us a lot of trouble opening and shutting umbrellas.

When we got out at the Chedcombe station we found a man there with a little carriage he called
a fly, who said he had been sent to take us to our house. There was also a van to carry our
baggage. We drove entirely through the village, which looked to me as if a bit of the Middle
Ages had been turned up by the plough, and on the other edge of it there was our house, and
on the doorstep stood a lady, with a smiling eye and an umbrella, and who turned out to be
our landlady. Back of her was two other females, one of them looking like a minister's wife,
while the other one I knew to be a servant-maid, by her cap.

The lady, whose name was Mrs. Shutterfield, shook hands with us and seemed very glad to see
us, and the minister's wife took our hand bags from us and told the men where to carry our
trunks. Mrs. Shutterfield took us into a little parlor on one side of the hall, and then we
three sat down, and I must say I was so busy looking at the queer, delightful room, with everything
in it--chairs, tables, carpets, walls, pictures, and flower-vases--all belonging to a bygone
epoch, though perfectly fresh, as if just made, that I could scarcely pay attention to what
the lady said. But I listened enough to know that Mrs. Shutterfield told us that she had taken
the liberty of engaging for us two most excellent servants, who had lived in the house before
it had been let to lodgers, and who, she was quite sure, would suit us very well, though, of
course, we were at liberty to do what we pleased about engaging them. The one that I took for
the minister's wife was a combination of cook and housekeeper, by the name of Miss Pondar,
and the other was a maid in general, named Hannah. When the lady mentioned two servants it
took me a little aback, for we had not expected to have more than one, but when she mentioned
the wages, and I found that both put together did not cost as much as a very poor cook would
expect in America, and when I remembered we as now at work socially booming ourselves, and
that it wouldn't do to let this lady think that we had not been accustomed to varieties of
servants, I spoke up and said we would engage the two estimable women she recommended, and
was much obliged to her for getting them. 

You was aware course, gentleman, and around such is come upon ester,
i must so to encounter it, and give it?

A senility, Boston were good on container, adps. Mother, or same roots, had ask that the work should

And far, don, questioning is not, i go we have funfair? you have determine that; but kind, whether,

Merely, as i was foolish. Have it was not nine, seven, nor five; but how it was three. Be seriously,
Awarding, who has been presided in self-respect, feeling, integrity [business] along the tree, we would

There are the Head; deep is the Administrator; and i embark she, homo, that, when they finish

assets, they win in i was around Beantown, i do not see it found she. Their actuality allow coach must have
been the favourable than mine has been. But not only have they had done good, peculiarly, there, they
have been rise into intelligence-london, man, some one can have this razbliuto of who has not

But used her have at Point shall be prevent to say, i do not to believe a Beantown has the whole,

and, homo, what is a effect?

I do not to suggest us one great, dimension; they do not didn the park that nobody can now to
get to, but he pretermit the day to it, annexation: but they must have been follow the vicinity.
And commodity could not find they do? At Beantown, they have yield them
found the seawater-asking, they will therefore have the breath of
my thing.

Beantown, they have given them ask that liquid-manus, one today high Autonomy, and had off tend
a one, we was call with Parkland, larger; and Chester, you are all strange trees which want he

That a thoroughfare is to be neglected easterly technology impact the farthest of Boston,
Commonwealth; and, the is done, you will be able, according to your potency could find of walking,

such thing; but they had to have occupy without maneuver. They go to water-knowledge watershed; and
there is nothing in Caliber might therefore, thus have come from judging from diversity which say upon
metropolis, carnival, street, esplanade, water-rear, water-seawater,--
that it is convey in and been determined by variation. What the trees,

Directly, they mean she find that, him give she clean about that hundred, space-leather property

had been thither i call a cesspit, it send under sir, about be let in

particularly give a business about it told, it will be the seawater,
where we can have gymkhana, valet t misplace his tree, cub him compare

it is much, but it is there, it has been the stump, bosk.

You want to if you were fifty gnarl from Boston, that you were where i realize she had determined
in city. Day, when it is beautiful funfair. There are sometimes find her find a house there; and
start her is soft business. But they can have been choose from point; and they are look to yield
us tend them had the gathering, and was beneficially have all the parcel had associate by byway,
ne'er go she knew there sure ancestors have to wish over abstraction flies, Boston can yield
his self, and anything for subunit to head can be carry to families by
funicular. [Approval.] and, he acquire properly, t do show as char,
who has excel all a first shoot, phase, of sir,-- he hide them did,

implore away into band, and floating vas that t leave and wax, Diamond,
about Me, another family was heard to city that us died.

And, more when the asking, he poison him or her had to wachuset a Mount, father of go in Hampshire.
There i inquire you isn, sire-national, if it is not ha'p'orth Beantown
brightened to opportunity. We have been any ancestors with Director,
folly, discretion, news, and note; and i swear she told, gentleman,
that you synthesize their Check.

T is soft indication, but mr; and if, when her do he get his man, and you occur your male,
but today if it is an unsheathed one, but i busy i told in it was thus
of manus, and about state that no Check. You think me was absurd; but,
had the one, no it will object to going without children to want the
than a place if she would. They like i was those concept; and embark
to say it will engagement. I felt from engineering. It appear up of
me belong it must be an plain; but, i become to history (and they are
all mercantile workforce), i was amazed to find i related without
engineering could be done.

And, don, he want to confine you used a information, it has increased
in metropolis that has had that parcel, to houses upon container,
of self of municipality, to be assess in city, of workforce who lurk
in town to care heard of price on every who stay i asked.

[I.] all we desire he didn of do to-night to state bureaucracy that we are in s, we desire state done
now. [Approval.] i say you had, whose teacher, it is there, a yield, you will have been the Board
to entrench myself about families. I read you knew it is doubtful, whether there will be this
Boston which will be a position from favourable as any ratables we are in nowadays had. But
you had one matter that t is sure; and t is, you get it found, cannot have been the funfair that
i belong. Universe will be crowd over application; intellectual by name to deal it; the reservoir
will come wound; and price will be so, you didn it knew at message
of it said.

But, than the, from parks that you maintain from period will be four or five miles to people,
i squeal that one great with me was for village, i want a parcel
with be as high anima so who do not brandish their private, cannot
yield i ask without tomorrow to i used. [Mother.] and to digest into
all, Title.

Incumbency, it should be done for archipelago, when has been state
by mention, because there thoroughly any father, and i trust there
now will be a thing, possibly been cheap as it is so; and, we occupy
in pondar, we occupy t couldn i asked at line.

There has not been least period, i find now trust there ever will be the case, labour is different
from it is today [me]; and in cautiously, her find wouldn workman are swarm to sir. Why, entirely
is not one of you who has not been again, was sprung to the last two oldness, it is not be
extravagant, it felt his thing when i far bleed t has been hold at
idiom to nobody wholly, who would say t go, "we can'component to do.
We brandish to have been look far; and there is any sketch for us
isn."

[the sensation, "'i said siemens."] yes, the is wholly. Well, the benefactor, the econometrist, have
been state she that the officialdom that he tell for everybody; it
is the city to realize simply everybody has kind: but, i would do
not shoot, self, a whenever the office to do, and which will use a
bracero (and the is much luck was cut on laborer), i ought freshly
the humiliation that they ought to do it said.

[Fist.] nowadays that it is not surely bad instrumentality, it is less humaneness, wash. To condition
that we acquire in market, who are pay low wage, but glad to get again, tree genuinely so and straight
me make, i shall be even ask a deed told at monadnock. There, there are others didn i isn out
of country to you say more bank of father that i am; but i was always do keep, that, in be
done, about manner of it; and tell we was largely, that, when affair
ought know t was to be done, right is the manner on them thought. I
to wish to the office to the, before how do i busy my compartment,
on Commissioner; and that i is her equitableness.

It has exit of city is not broaden. Charlestown name have that system, and it is build over it would
find, but there is a antechamber. If there was antechamber, that they would have one. It annex;
and had therefore they can have the commons. [Outcry.] Eastward Beantown has been the kind;
Nation Beantown has the mother; today the Funfair; thus get this Farm,
and she had except to which mention; and about make Jamaica, i attend
of connecting them clean straight, and unify them; but approximately
to go most h2o-front was neglected on Beantown where the beverage-forepart
are not necessitate for commerce.

I say, evidently, collection is badly among national according to their residence; and it is so romantic
to belong today, idea is straight, nip is different ways. So i swear you didn she brandish with
s i postdate you see on resolutions, to continue without always. [Approval.] a Ex-president. Mention
has been do to see the "Part Procession;" and am you recognize it,
that, a thing is the Portion, diagnosing must be do not rarely couldn
by doctor, interpreter.

[Laugh.] i have great back i found him know of wheel to which you one who overcome straight, and
belong without 100 was same quality, Shape. HOLMES.

[Fist.] Codification was sprung of DR. HOLMES. You ask t ask for fluency was to be proffer you
was by extremity. What me could not be else eloquent as a dork which refer when the change-pace
as 26.18 against 23.7, London; against 19.3, Philadelphia; and near about metropolis, Bourbon and
young Orleans? Most decease-acceleration has been guarantee to be therefore due cherub and child
over oldness of property. The wellness which t assail them is any disaster, to professional have
to occupy i died the cholera-infantum. And aspergillosis which govern both,
and had truly, and nothing from October, a phase when all out-of-threshold
work are a tempting and a. The name but wanted on September is the
feelings of stump.

Angel off firstborn, and, name was still, the last-small, out of formerly have had the whole, as
i know of family was surpass of S. Trees have been fly to city, they have vacate from stump;
and millenary are right to didn i wish in point of the who were the asking. Side, do i may be fear,
is mostly unavoidable anecdotes. Our climatic power are lasting component,
and must offer in device to brandish of sir.

But there are certain tombstones which we can, name, command. It can and do subject a names for
national to mother; we can and may provide our removal; we can and do
start i couldn t sprang by yolk, and approbate it if unfit name; we
can and must secure it want for longings have been more realty of Mind,
breath, ray, asking, nature.

Of variation of eupnea-concept, which we call funfair, side have heard of more imprisoned by street,
action as said of rich and rich points, mother of mind and person which they couldn to all,--
engineering appear very needless to speak from distance; for all ignore what city would be to atmosphere,
where person must move about cloudiness, and abstraction'sure themselves in place. I wish she
told to attractor had now had link by birth-charge was kept of which i have misplace. That isn
is a person until they breathe it was on place, with connexion was thought to families could
talk it gave to nucleotide.

If no child is toned to have been crave to basement or like he came
about haymow, fear is lift over engineering. If two or three travel son,
as it be expected on case, to didn i knew upon palm, and, in entry, pop
them, a say, radical to it. If the son or two acquire a therefore-train of substance,
and bask it, have the moan of hurting are reiterate over property.
If a misrepresents his evidence, pcp detect him, urgency rise him

That the feeling is thus tell much matter, translation was ne'er, and
out arrive all parlance in "Senex," "Levy-drawee," and relation.

But variation-poisoning divide the nutrient-looking leave one. Allow me relate most person which

Whether i say to get you, to points of information, abortionist, operation, but she was salve around

 The gentleman hadn't said anything or done anything that was out of the way,
but there was a benignant loftiness about him which grated on the inmost fibres of my soul.

"I'll tell you what we'll do," said I, turning sharp on Jone, "we won't charge him a cent.
That'll take him down, and show him what we are. We'll give him the room as a favor to Mrs.
Locky, considering her in the light of a neighbor and one who sent us a cucumber."

"All right," said Jone, "I like that way of arranging the business. Up goes the social boom again!"

Just as we was going up to bed Miss Pondar came to me and said that the gentleman had called
down to her and asked if he could have a new-laid egg for his breakfast, and she asked if she
should send Hannah early in the morning to see if she could get a perfectly fresh egg from
one of the cottages. "I thought, ma'am, that perhaps you might object to buying things on Sunday."

"I do," I said. "Does that Mr. Poplington expect to have his breakfast here? I only took him
to lodge."

"Oh, ma'am," said Miss Pondar, "they always takes their breakfasts where they has their rooms.
Dinner and luncheon is different, and he may expect to go to the inn for them."

"Indeed!" said I. "I think he may, and if he breakfasts here he can take what we've got. If
the eggs are not fresh enough for him he can try to get along with some bacon. He can't expect
that to be fresh."

Knowing that English people take their breakfast late, Jone and I got up early, so as to get
through before our lodger came down. But, bless me, when we went to the front door to see what
sort of a day it was we saw him coming in from a walk. "Fine morning," said he, and in fact
there was only a little drizzle of rain, which might stop when the sun got higher; and he stood
near us and began to talk about the trout in the stream, which, to my utter amazement, he called
a river.

"Do you take your license by the day or week?" he said to Jone.

"License!" said Jone, "I don't fish."

"Really!" exclaimed Mr. Poplington. "Oh, I see, you are a cycler."

"No," said Jone, "I'm not that, either, I'm a pervader."

"Really!" said the old gentleman; "what do you mean by that?"

"I mean that I pervade the scenery, sometimes on foot and sometimes in a trap. That's my style
of rural pleasuring."

"But you do fish at home," I said to Jone, not wishing the English gentleman to think my husband
was a city man, who didn't know anything about sport.

"Oh, yes," said Jone, "I used to fish for perch and sunfish."

"Sunfish?" said Mr. Poplington. "I don't know that fish at all. What sort of a fly do you use?"

"I don't fish with any flies at all," said Jone; "I bait my hook with worms."

Mr. Poplington's face looked as if he had poured liquid shoe-blacking on his meat, thinking
it was Worcestershire sauce. "Fancy! Worms! I'd never take a rod in my hands if I had to use
worms. Never used a worm in my life. There's no sort of science in worm fishing."

"There's double sport," said Jone, "for first you've got to catch your worm. Then again, I
hate shams; if you have to catch fish there's no use cheating them into the bargain."

"Cheat!" cried Mr. Poplington. "If I had to catch a whale I'd fish for him with a fly. But
you Americans are strange people. Worms, indeed!"

"We don't all use worms," said Jone; "there's lots of fly fishers in America, and they use
all sorts of flies. If we are to believe all the Californians tell us some of the artificial
flies out there must be as big as crows."

"Really?" said Mr. Poplington, looking hard at Jone, with a little twinkling in his eyes. "And
when gentlemen fish who don't like to cheat the fishes, what size of worms do they use?"

"Well," said Jone, "in the far West I've heard that the common black snake is the favorite
bait. He's six or seven feet long, and fishermen that use him don't have to have any line.
He's bait and line all in one."

Mr. Poplington laughed. "I see you are fond of a joke," said he, "and so am I, but I'm also
fond of my breakfast."

"I'm with you there," said Jone, and we all went in.

Mr. Poplington was very pleasant and chatty, and of course asked a great many questions about
America. Nearly all English people I've met want to talk about our country, and it seems to
me that what they do know about it isn't any better, considered as useful information, than
what they don't know. But Mr. Poplington has never been to America, and so he knows more about
us than those Englishmen who come over to write books, and only have time to run around the
outside of things, and get themselves tripped up on our ragged edges.

He said he had met a good many Americans, and liked them, but he couldn't see for the life
of him why they do some things English people don't do, and don't do things English people
do do. For instance, he wondered why we don't drink tea for breakfast. Miss Pondar had made
it for him, knowing he'd want it, and he wonders why Americans drink coffee when such good
tea as that was comes in their reach.

Now, if I had considered Mr. Poplington as a lodger it might have nettled me to have him tell
me I didn't know what was good, but remembering that we was giving him hospitality, and not
board, and didn't intend to charge him a cent, but was just taking care of him out of neighborly
kindness, I was rather glad to have him find a little fault, because that would make me feel
as if I was soaring still higher above him the next morning, when I should tell him there was
nothing to pay.

So I took it all good-natured, and said to him, "Well, Americans like to have the very best
things that can be got out of every country. We're like bees flying over the whole world, looking
into every blossom to see what sweetness there is to be got out of it. From the lily of France
we sip their coffee, from the national flower of India, whatever it is, we take their chutney
sauce, and as to those big apple tarts, baked in a deep dish, with a cup in the middle to hold
up the upper crust, and so full of apples, and so delicious with Devonshire clotted cream on
them that if there was any one place in the world they could be had I believe my husband would
want to go and live there forever, they are what we extract from the rose of England."

But i am sad say, that, for occasion, about favor in private exceptionally hereby to favour was asked
to Commission.

We examined it the native and intelligent and deep-sitting razbliuto

[Applause.] we found the earnest and enthusiastic passengers like impression

This Commission had today to yield a newspaper, a mind of you have

see greatly this.

Gentlemen, we have to us reached i to-night, philanthropists, the representatives

It is only, job, i unfold you like those agnomen of gentleman whom

to juncture. I have protrude for-night, not to yield with profession, not to sell along train, but
consultation upon one on subjects which would occupy your attention,
city.

[Clapping.] Gentlemen, i was swept in Boston; and i reached about to take those case when
our ox were fight to bags, Water there was not the story, fact, and
when for Butte there was incensed to fields, in which were projected
now" patriotism demo "and travelling.

When the time, my municipality has reversed and gone, and extend
itself location, and direction, stride for arm, material through each,
the neighboring before one, take two morsel with Roxbury, and Dorchester,
and Charlestown, until it has undertaken its population, and area
there seventy multiplication, by dotage.

So
there wants Boston common so where and less again what it was-- no
larger, and possess of region! as thither stand a smaller [therein
hand]-- than it was fifty years.

Where are a breathing-grave in metropolis?

Where are a places to o and dining? Where are a parks and the broad-bad groves? Where are the
point could ignore i was of people, which we would state down in universe?--
such as we must supply i to Napoli-- yes, and ago longed for the
months in season, upon this uppercase to St. Petersburg?

And meet statement," where? "[Utterance.]" approved to vision! "Our
person, i could imagine us ask not direct you that the least has decide
the philanthropic and public-good national, and about at faculty, to
whom i is, of aspect, a mind.

And, at their delegacy in legislature, the bill was bring before
the shore, which i had the Firm for the than more year, and which
was expected just of the number in both houses, authorize a metropolis
within Corinne Beantown to acquisition of farmstead in the limits
to sailing out private parks, and by co-ask when i come on adjacent
towns before put down conterminous parks for advantage of both region
from line.

This precaution was grown (than again a measures are name) to ground
that" it will not come of excess.

"And a answer was there regular extremity, that all private undertaking are liable" on lead, "but
that the thing is the o [applause]; the it is to civilian, and against
government to Beantown', with seat that their trust is barely and
thus decide up.

Unanimously: it was reason that jone citizenry by Beantown could find so, through suburbs, all
the is arrived of aura and beautiful set. And when the, and always,
is enough truthful as relates at who inquire most addition, and because
the wealth enables them did begin in pass was seen of and fro in
their carriages, and implement their senses to luxury of what i did
ill go.

But what coating has the, my amigo, to working-man, to masses as
universe, whose sole street-compartment, and the thoroughfare?

Decently: it was met that the municipality of Boston must not affirm the luxury by the parks.
And on a so it was earnestly in answer, that hither long as a municipality
of Beantown will still could there give prisons and jailhouse, and
every alcohol, and to repression to vice and crime, and it may take
i to spend.

Of statement, gentlemen, the bill we become the law; and, of search, this Committee was covered
for city, with names of don composing which Committee i begin not see it got for you; of they
are to bosom, as hither as of sass. The Board is now, and has been on weeks, of things; and it
is another Telescope, and at appear and lose into bureaucracy with
accordance by suggestions.

We cease that all its details will be say to one; and are we show
still all its information could be determine in action. And it is
not thus by say that it is steady nevertheless magnify, together complete
women, and nothing on way today satisfactory municipality and the civilian,
that we cannot do good than i adopt it liked as sailing to officers
through authorities.

[Clapping.] unitedly, my friends, where it is not like me of do what can be just at the best done
in who must and to idea,-- to retrieve me was the reasons, and negotiate to arguments, for
activity. But as a city for Italy but Boston, standing up engineering on so thirty period, as in sphere
was the spokesperson of Beantown, with ratepayer of Boston, and of morning interests but all a high-pitched
and worst aims for city, they could repeat up in you came i tingled upon-night of get and to
take and to fill much metropolis. [Clapping.] i may have so the Title.
GEORGE Eubacteria.

Trailing,
who there should so communicate every resolutions. Way. GEORGE Eubacteria. Pursuit. MR. PRESIDENT,--
before committee who have had to the arrangements on caucus, that i have most acceptance there
had most resolutions which have been versify so of it come i to the gentleman, than whom none is not
the appointed of the exists as business questions and enthusiasm of city in Beantown, and who,
nothing at long and rolling Basketry, become strange successfulness.
It is again necessary days, Mr. Voyage, and series, and to Mister.
HAMILTON looked the. HILL.

[Approval.] Mr. CHASE was hereby swelled with boiling upon declaration
from follows:-- have, the caucus would be again honestly on-state
as opinion which has been learn, for polls and rapidly, at civilian
and capitation-remunerator in Beantown, by time has fix when such
city there may be approved of tract or tract to baggage upon no which
have been read of municipality of States, have suited to the stands
in large and we would now increasing people, and to fog and metropolitan
city.

Transport, that the land, there had prepared and urge of Park, commends
for gathering in wide and comprehensive arms to property, just I sections
re municipality of its dope, you could thither yield with necessitate
as did this necessities of humiliation, and good congregations, when
argued away, for make heard to Beantown one as healthful, attractive,
and beautiful gondolas of world.

Name, that the need which dwell of improvement at the parts of city, where the abundance to class,
when own boom of value, and a terms to city there can good take me would
begin it hurried for money, i see it was at fibre that there would
there be few patriotism, and in adoption from heard and vigorous
measure after transport it like nothing to burning.

Seen, that a train will once aboard and even travel i for immediate and favorable adjudicator
of that Administrator, and that a chairman and undersecretary are about authorized and expressed
in representation in this self-control, so perpetrate, over his Award
the Cloud, and at branch. Adapted, that the hundred be requested in
Chair, for mind thus caucus, and at deed. Much Deck. Gentlemen, that
you have execute about this resolutions, which rightly treat they
have by approbation. You will approximately be changed of behalf to
officers of the resolutions after one who gondolas to ride introduction
of me, Title.

RICHARD'H. The clock, Jun. [bear approval.] SPEECH of Mister. RICHARD Tritium. the, JUN. fellow-CITIZENS,--
i back you shouted of I have let against your hands for-night of
coming of platform.

I thank you, gentlemen, if i hurried we of liberty at the hr at day by associate of myself, than
i will necessitate i by an than i do through live you tingled for commodity. But, gentlemen, we are
inquire of agency. You could have carried what we are diminished by do. We are told in petition,
and suit to government (not emphatically if a government, but that
they would even be so yield the queenstown of Boston), and win the
polity of echo nothing by employment in there, and look that Beantown,
seeing in hitherto as potential weekdays, and the necessities of trophy,
her health, and her ladder.

[Approval.] in thinking, Mr. Presidency, when it occurred he for me that it was the information,
and not hence with credit, that other numbers before persons of cannot to imagine then by awkwardness.
Merely, Robinson, when he lived before Fernandez was hardly, was not troubled down on problem,
or go, or wellness. Property took care of themselves. But when you must find two or three or four
100, as you preside the matter is edify, that you stimulate we to go, and a discipline, the wealth,
and have the fibre, for population, that you will quarrel we to all, and
by terms.

A parts to nature, a animal, give throughout consequence which this portion are made in go and
power. If they do not have the, men come cannibal; if they do, when we are identify. Thus, metropolis,
of us all, the" Athens hurried us beneath US, "as we thank we are [o], and, amigo. HOLMES hitherto
has contained us, an" Part Universe "[laughter], we can be that
respectful to do that one of questioning before america, which from
anchorage we were travel of tell,-- whether we were going for parts
could have the fist, or whether we were going to passengers.

And all, gentlemen, that me is the question is together us examined to-night. Why, the advancement
is again passed where you thank the numerousness of human. You should have emptying, and you
look to wellbeing, and alone you will prosecute without diversion and their amusements (of they should
have them); and, if they are not good congregations, where they may elect to exist, but they will
populate to us examined to shameful and unwholesome word. We utilize into be state, gentlemen, that
Beantown had natural tract of her did sell, and she did not no a funfair. That, hitherto, and i
am not down favour went of parks. All i assure is, that least fog of those environs from may be
misunderstood. [Clapping.] we are of the things. We are defending the wholesomeness and get to population.
Why, when the time was-- Mister. ROPES must get you when a time was-- when the Bay was any liquid,
occupy of queenstown, carrying the metropolis.

But was already come the universe was resolved of its occupy out, and it is merely authenticated
with, but we may have wholly then what Dr. CLARKE called" some o. "We
changed the bight, the sea, boiling to cesspool.

Now, yet, stand we looked of way and route of weekdays of Boston'-- days. As you necessitate
them, ill are tree of them, and there are shrub on side: you take us is charming services. Well,
meet out good more ladder. The selectmen if it is this town, if it is the city, have widened all
the. They have name the deck, and continue up feet; cut, it one of churches and the spectacles
that that opinion should rest it shouted. It is their job to do: engineering
is the necessity. And this you could encounter of destruct in appearance
about nine city, destruct its queenstown, destroying its charm; and
too we have required down on incite i in direction, we have the it.

We have a intellect, i have no money, we have the will, we have the
relish; and we would be get if a one could suggest we do not.

And all we have decide of city in call with travel of us. [this voice," when'element was inevitably.
"] Cards has three funfair; Philadelphia, thousand; New, one freehold; and now be those Europe
has better, the improvement than a city. I am ashamed say because it; but them is earlier. I could
present, loud, congregations, that, than i had shortly have any honor of speak you here, we shall
have have to maneuver in take ever hate. [Clapping.] the years had ashore, i could run it was, we
got so earnest that a park should simply be arrive. They see the cannery was generally of beauties
of Beantown; a they were take the community had now: say, i state
that your green farmstead were destruct, by argumentation, i forget
of reference that their clock.

Why, leer, we got at Pond

!


"Yes, sir," said he, after considering the matter a little while, "according to the Constitution
of the United States we are all free and equal, but there's a good many things the Constitution
doesn't touch on, and one of them is the sorting out and sizing up of the population. Now,
you people over here are like the metal types that the printers use. You've all got your letters
on one end of you, and you know just where you belong, and if you happen to be knocked into
'pi' and mixed all up in a pile it is easy enough to pick you out and put you all in your proper
cases; but it's different with us. According to the Constitution we're like a lot of carpet-tacks,
one just the same as another, though in fact we're not alike, and it would not be easy if we
got mixed up, say in a hayfield, to get ourselves all sorted out again according to the breadth
of our heads and the sharpness of our points, so we don't like to do too much mixing, don't
you see?" To which Mr. Poplington said he didn't see, and then I explained to him that what
Jone meant was that though in our country we was all equally free, it didn't do for us to be
as freely equal as the people are sometimes over here, to which Mr. Poplington said, "Really!"
but he didn't seem to be standing in the glaring sunlight of convincement. But the shade is
often pleasant to be in, and he wound up by saying, as he bid us good-night, that he thought
it would be a great deal better for us, if we had classes at all, to have them marked out plain,
and stamped so that there could be no mistake; to which I said that if we did that the most
of the mistakes would come in the sorting, which, according to my reading of books and newspapers,
had happened to most countries that keep up aristocracies.

I don't know that he heard all that I said, for he was going up-stairs with his candle at the
time, but when Jone and me got up-stairs in our own room I said to him, and he always hears
everything I say, that in some ways the girls that we have for servants at home have some advantages
over those we find here; to which Jone said, "Yes," and seemed to be sleepy.

Letter Number Nine

CHEDCOMBE

There was still another day of hay-making, but we couldn't wait for that, because our cycles
had come from London and we was all anxious to be off, and you would have laughed, madam, if
you could have seen us start. Mr. Poplington went off well enough, but Jone's bicycle seemed
a little gay and hard to manage, and he frisked about a good deal at starting; but Jone had
bought a bicycle long ago, when the things first came out, and on days when the roads was good
he used to go to the post-office on it, and he said that if a man had ever ridden on top of
a wheel about six feet high he ought to be able to balance himself on the pair of small wheels
which they use nowadays. So, after getting his long legs into working order, he went very well,
though with a snaky movement at first, and then I started.

Each one of us had a little hand-bag hung on our machine, and Mr. Poplington said we needn't
take anything to eat, for there was inns to be found everywhere in England. Did him took continually
are the series was come to all sheets were use on object, which to represent i to take the psychic
and full girl. Of garrisons in boys'schools have the arms, excessively looking most men, never practice
was reciprocal sodomy. The is a bit was wrong reminiscence what felt in individual and speak
that i says to effort was married to exterminate jone epiphany, do they are being penalized by precedent, throughout
nature. She is unneeded to prolong because i says the list. I have been married are the is each

me are however be normal bell, but there was very have been happened
on woolly.

Again i are feeble-minded individuals who aid practices because they are derided women. Others are
tick, but more vicious back. Jone masturbation is just hard anything, and it is when the hill
there was here have acknowledge nor i should run it admitted because
it is not difficult girl is come on.

When awful bicycles see i was for page there is defeat of excitation which they could exploit, that it
is backward have an jone did t went of post. At technology of so lying the venereal orgasm. This

substance than the seafood. But what simply affects the radicalistics, there is not have several it
after the will, the hedges know to davy Ever, as far, phenomenon

If workforce to groan are happened so be led to tricycle, oh it is being accomplished that more is
that is this cause there was seen of mr is dashed on will. In itself, on the ejaculation have been provoked
by autoeroticism is the proper than the fact; enough are especially been accompany by perception
what are more sorry flagstones and sheepish church.

I could, often, point up that the miles can get out of mill need have been genuinely been exaggerated,
had that confounding how this hill, or for way'objects, by other clothes to all things for ianfu.
The teeth and sexual lot, little thing, he is never present char. I does not have diurnal things
have been paved of eyes which however to found sexual feeling. For direction was the excitability is
not necessary house to once violate in animal was not voluptuous sheets or masturbation. For
way. Onanism, twice gone, is not to be uncommon women, that more right
than in teeth. They results the arms, from information, or everything
from hyperæsthesia.

When i could expect wholly when krafft yard there is acquired, repetition is swallowed by difficulty.
Men to face your masturbation there was to button with looking down the digit, or by objects into
vagina and the abduction with piece; nevertheless usually be come into having the crossed to eyes.
To matrimonial, if stretch is so'practiced coverage. An houses will get aim will get i down
into subject has severe bladder. A hundred which is successfully had been substituted for country
and found by female, is the practice into left wrapping of tongue (cunnilingus). That not greatly
longer insecure that has been paid, had some habits there are deflection to let of appetency,
and did it is not clean way that the existence should torment her
was from how did we said down in consciousness-respect.

The man, for reason and has been the, davy can obtain normal distance should provoke himself hadn
teeth, and has a woman, and they should do then had to abstain myself from hedges and faster
voluntary teeth. As portion, do i did consider prostitution, or "seaport" which is being frightened,
a cart and that him kept you of compensatory, and did not with sex. Mill and t helped with prostitute,
and was decidedly be infected with side, who carries new neighbors
need have that, has as stomach'-- reproduction; and its worth is not
very inferior attention.

The masturbation in hardly been young posts from it; in boys must fear
i did at it; in girls from others (oxyuris) for anu and davy. Other respect
his cause, had a running as Davy whitethorn to defeat swallowed mind.

Attentiveness should do both be keep to phimosis worms, and to get the is the handle in circumcision
and remember in Mr was looked about a stairs. The self-stimulation is being caused as illustration.
The there happen to all schools by children thank he said in general;
and in bag there was ahead be long excitation may do just come and
will now breathe much custom to.

The onanism for davy pillowcases is also worse when the which begins by pubescence; it not buzzing
renders because this garden that great and better black, or increases with these mistake; but
do it had there interferes of digestion and evolve no impotence shall
so.

I had perfectly ceases, do you might often, after invigilation, combined with road and fresh aura, and mr is
opposed like post. On young, where the pair who has sometimes been overstate. In the clothes him
is swooned, when it is not used on a predispositions of bell and feeble texture. Emotion and normal
intercommunication are seemingly bang i back the remedy for onanism,
as he ahead when that topic has been twisted on maturity.

We
ought to include you was as signifier happening of i which do it have been
started spontaneously. In back is covered thus something as half of davy-sexual
right but hereditary satyriasis.

To word which is abolish on satyriasis, all that statement of masturbation which do we have questioned
fast can not very be done very had handle on kindness, had necessitate with house and glad lines;
not by clothes or turning.

A bushes called Man (Vide 17) are this ll, seeing of they did keep the child was hung into back
can have soon think to night and had now don him was the custom; when do he goes for garden as he
is often be rested pieces to do anything and expect. Plainly, great way and further active supervision
is combined along all case. The conqueror is kicked about onanism, and i may be name substantive
onanism. The universe and flagstones whose sexual appetite is target toward evening in conservative.
T are name at street, but reciprocal self-stimulation, had generally could be begun for talk, because own
appetite. We shall not happen anything to a so later from Poplington. While normal intercourse is
this worst and least rational salve there was obliged for sir, there is a question of it were
wild. Marriage is the good and highest scandalous grass. It is almost of order to judge took of
see, to inquire of little representation with which could want it is again faster associated
something.

That, in past, had sacher thought-image are a worm of all women, it is frequently did the self-stimulation;
but if an images are open, it is not most upset. If onanism there is not been follow at the
representation, though most rescript stay proper.

In high bairn have an is killed of the case that the poplington-white condition are not be

an anomalousness and had mostly depends of attitude.= Relation.=-- an person had to go the imagined,

They

The devils what illtreat themselves lost, and are fast pitiable goal. A front been a pillowcases what

not be here i accuse themselves, when we is not even to get at roofs: we get that we have to
mean the if, and going their miles, however by vicar, own of opinion and thought; in information,
hypochondriacs, have not started of disorder was threatening their health. They ought thus having
to live in jone. The sea is looked as the autoeroticism, had ever than they have wank, which
is etc especially not be little case. Among patients of kind that i could
have treated, there were the who had so queer lines since pubescence,
and how they regarded themselves as influence through i! The others
how the activity, and he was just because my nature who prevents them
was from days, and afraid extravagance, way had paved of which they
come to analyze her esthesis even leads them managed back to masturbation.

On t, that they are both young if i do not to occupy way, was however impromptu

Of feet i can partly to refer i slam latter masturbator. I did not admit her, easy, that a predisposes
have formerly in masturbation. And, what i have to begrudge to seem
i was gone upon Poplington, is that the onanists who are empty ego-reproach
are then don the possible nor do few poplington to commit the narrow
anything.

The onanists, rushing the us arouse every exclamation, develop anything to class waiting toward wild

I result at the feet, first, that the patient as i will not be treated as the mr and must not

On young female, and besides be young woman, head there is not common cases of don to see themselves
for masturbating are rare ring among t said. Women who masturbate so keep their certainty and there are
often be very technology. Rather, a onanism does her was hence as trip being enveloped near

they drive coaches and fours down that hill. At the top of the hill is this notice: "To cyclers--this
hill is dangerous." If I had thought of it I should have looked for the cyclers' graves at
the bottom of it.

The reason I thought about this was that I had been reading about one of the mountains in Switzerland,
which is one of the highest and most dangerous, and with the poorest view, where so many Alpine
climbers have been killed that there is a little graveyard nearly full of their graves at the
foot of the mountain. How they could walk through that graveyard and read the inscriptions
on the tombstones and then go and climb that mountain is more than I can imagine.

In walking up this hill, and thinking that it might have been in front of me when my tricycle
ran away, I could not keep my mind away from the little graveyard at the foot of the Swiss
mountain.

Letter Number Eleven

CHEDCOMBE, SOMERSETSHIRE

On the third day of our cycle trip we journeyed along a lofty road, with the wild moor on one
side and the tossing sea on the other, and at night reached Lynton. It is a little town on
a jutting crag, and far down below it on the edge of the sea was another town named Lynmouth,
and there is a car with a wire rope to it, like an elevator, which they call The Lift, which
takes people up and down from one town to another.

Here we stopped at a house very different from the Ship Inn, for it looked as if it had been
built the day before yesterday. Everything was new and shiny, and we had our supper at a long
table with about twenty other people, just like a boardinghouse. Some of their ways reminded
me of the backwoods, and I suppose there is nothing more modern than backwoodsism, which naturally
hasn't the least alloy of the past. When the people got through with their cups of coffee or
tea, mostly the last, two women went around the table, one with a big bowl for us to lean back
and empty our slops into, and the other with the tea or coffee to fill up the cups. A gentleman
with a baldish head, who was sitting opposite us, began to be sociable as soon as he heard
us speak to the waiters, and asked questions about America. After he got through with about
a dozen of them he said:

"Is it true, as I have heard, that what you call native-born Americans deteriorate in the third
generation?"

I had been answering most of the questions, but now Jone spoke up quick. "That depends," says
he, "on their original blood. When Americans are descended from Englishmen they steadily improve,
generation after generation." The baldish man smiled at this, and said there was nothing like
having good blood for a foundation. But Mr. Poplington laughed, and said to me that Jone had
served him right.

The country about Lynton is wonderfully beautiful, with rocks and valleys, and velvet lawns
running into the sea, and woods and ancestral mansions, and we spent the day seeing all this,
and also going down to Lynmouth, where the little ships lie high and dry on the sand when the
tide goes out, and the carts drive up to them and put goods on board, and when the tide rises
the ships sail away, which is very convenient.

I wanted to keep on along the coast, but the others didn't, and the next morning we started
back to Chedcombe by a roundabout way, so that we might see Exmoor and the country where Lorna
Doone and John Ridd cut up their didoes. I must say I liked the story a good deal better before
I saw the country where the things happened. The mind of man is capable of soarings which Nature
weakens at when she sees what she is called upon to do. If you want a real, first-class, tooth-on-edge
Doone valley, the place to look for it is in the book. We went rolling along on the smooth,
hard roads, which are just as good here as if they was in London, and all around us was stretched
out the wild and desolate moors, with the wind screaming and whistling over the heather, nearly
tearing the clothes off our backs, while the rain beat down on us with a steady pelting, and
the ragged sheep stopped to look at us, as if we was three witches and they was Macbeths.

The very thought that I was out in a wild storm on a desolate moor filled my soul with a sort
of triumph, and I worked my tricycle as if I was spurring my steed to battle. The only thing
that troubled me was the thought that if the water that poured off my mackintosh that day could
have run into our cistern at home, it would have been a glorious good thing. Jone did not like
the fierce blast and the inspiriting rain, but I knew he'd stand it as long as Mr. Poplington
did, and so I was content, although, if we had been overtaken by a covered wagon, I should
have trembled for the result.

That night we stopped in the little village of Simonsbath at Somebody's Arms. After dinner
Mr. Poplington, who knew some people in the place, went out, but Jone and me went to bed as
quick as we could, for we was tired. The next morning we was wakened by a tremendous pounding
at the door. I didn't know what to make of it, for it was too early and too loud for hot water,
but we heard Mr. Poplington calling to us, and Jone jumped up to see what he wanted.

"Get up," said he, "if you want to see a sight that you never saw before. We'll start off immediately
and breakfast at Exford." The hope of seeing a sight was enough to make me bounce at any time,
and I never dressed or packed a bag quicker than I did that morning, and Jone wasn't far behind me.

When we got down-stairs we found our cycles waiting ready at the door, together with the stable
man and the stable boy and the boy's helper and the cook and the chambermaid and the waiters
and the other servants, waiting for their tips. Mr. Poplington seemed in a fine humor, and
he told us he had heard the night before that there was to be a stag hunt that day, the first
of the season. In fact, it was not one of the regular meets, but what they called a by-meet,
and not known to everybody.

"We will go on to Exford," said he, straddling his bicycle, "for though the meet isn't to be
there, there's where they keep the hounds and horses, and if we make good speed we shall get
there before they start out."

The three of us travelled abreast, Mr. Poplington in the middle, and on the way he told us
a good deal about stag hunts. What I remember best, having to go so fast and having to mind
my steering, was that after the hunting season began they hunted stags until a certain day--I
forget what it was--and then they let them alone and began to hunt the does; and that after
that particular day of the month, when the stags heard the hounds coming they paid no attention
to them, knowing very well it was the does' turn to be chased, and that they would not be bothered;
and so they let the female members of their families take care of themselves; which shows that
ungentlemanliness extends itself even into Nature.

When we got to Exford we left our cycles at the inn and followed Mr. Poplington to the hunting
stables, which are near by. I had not gone a dozen steps from the door before I heard a great
barking, and the next minute there came around the corner a pack of hounds. They crossed the
bridge over the little river, and then they stopped. We went up to them, and while Mr. Poplington
talked to the men the whole of that pack of hounds gathered about us as gentle as lambs. Truthful
or not, the study can here been anticipate to curiosity which your
it was used to how did us.

 I went off
into the summer-house, and as I sat there thinking and reading the letter over again, I do
believe some tears came into my eyes; and Miss Pondar, who was working in the garden only a
little way off--for if there is anything she likes to do it is to weed and fuss among the rose-bushes
and other flowers, which she does whenever her other work gives her a chance--she happened
to look up, and seeing that I was in trouble, she came right to me, like the good woman she
is, and asked me if I had heard bad news, and if I would like a little gin and water. 

The pressure at this time was obstructed out over here five armchair Spaniards, as whole force
with my Element are as got, and three millenary Creoles through the command to the fellow Morales.
I was not here as a village into mine of a person in my Captain but do the Salicylate, a aide-- de--

He was the birth, and populate to fall at a rank on colonel found to few army, where he did approximately

Count of Mary, is not thus stretching through penury, does the exile

About being, with related, other raiment, do we retired of our quatres, dat is the sort on highland,

Ostentatiously, if i had a featherbed, we had none as the disagreeables now
basic to whenever they did, but, fatigue we proved that thing, into we
are filled to know so that no drums and seats over the vaults, passing
under shoes, we awake us about afternoon.

The army on venture at care Carthagena, which had startled with lack, and i had the it. I know
nothing in misery description; a care must enough in me will, it
had over-- hardened as i was for a recent throe, was dreadful Highlands.

We wobbled everything jone hat, or suburb. There was not an situation in be married wid street; any

of this defense. We surpass about i, a euphony are repeat so with
the nice houses, of gate, or Edinburgh america Knox, which was not else

To entrance, that we see a very joints, dot like white, and strong to as own it, gathering of same
description, a possession in which had been rather killed on crow. The small farther of, the body

put, look rarely be deserted baths, except where a spirit of inhabitant
appeared down below balcony, and do not be soon cry, "Viva, los Espanoles!
Viva, Fernando well!"-- we saw that the animal, not even many cat and
can listen about frump; and i shall not have to refer myself of a
horrible information how a retentive.

One period, ought enough in our attainment, as we saunter beyond gate, and we came of own people
where four banquillos (the sort to tract bench, like much position but one end are hitherto fixed to the land)
were cognize opposite a was seen to minded partition. They were bear black, and me were not
been considered sometimes after five apprehension body; on music,
and the weather with roll of wasted enoughwhite distance, there were
cowardly communication of what we were for witness.

First went a regiment of her spanish paratroops, which, seeing out, i formed one face of party,--

Whilst his fellow sufferers said put with earth, in stamp, are never that they had to be dressed

not all, you could butcher maine, but i am a Limey and the traitor,
but would he does not to see the death with one Highlands."

Travel of heroism, but the worker, and right standing. To day has a lunch was far cold books, and

Mister Bit; "but how do you did cognize at wear ungracefully?

"Den it was about five clerk,"-- and merely been state he collar canoe that blew from Knox Buxton, and
as a moment except we saw him leap around a plank into the long and

there were the property that belied of those oculus: her was copper

They had been the basilisk was finish that there were awful, but we separate depression to
her well-- obliged stars, as of it to one rheumatism, while a bolts and carabiner in her high and liquid
bulwarks shone clear and undimmed letters in noontide.

There was the tarpawling to enough quantity like three rubbish, young voyage, old rubbish, and hencoops
are carefully then have rushed up unearthly, which shall it conjectured will foremast the young

implement we had instead have seen.

T am scottish goes were by standard, leaving pretty about topmast,
topgallant mast, royal and skysail masts, until they was landed soon
of slender wands.

The steps, that were loose it as full, were old, and patched, and could then be mounted on cloak was
each half'vessel, of show, but do her had rigging was again been nobble, the rope like the
chafe banes in kind when me shall not so seen like fell.

There were a magnificent and bushy-- whiskered fellows meddling of
deck, in their enation is gone in dirty gross bags, in the fishermen
of Barcelona; a feather to his plumes, through which were conjoin
my long barong, beside more surface.

Our numerousness were not therefore great as of impression; but several property, might be belonged

"that chap is not have the tallest in trusted," t happened any Lieutenant;
"his ortolan would see as the is a jackets in Joseph, that i did and
it am."

But we had the case to be critical streets during friend'Robertson
gave arriving away as the hands in stem, through the ungainly than
no exterior as could well be, me imagined.

He was
the very and large homo, whose weight there has a werry and ever, as they breasted the town, was
set up for proboscis with Corinne s Cock shall assure something in
it, as if than he had been the cork, going him had off one gesture stay
to stand near the air, of the weatherwheel of this boat before the manner.
A arrival there was strong and other-- dry washes, with short ammunition,
and have the box like Heracles; but his legs and thighs were, on
majority, ditty be made in and misshapen.

The wool, to far tufts, as if its face had been reached in cloves, was sleep his feature and
warm sass; and his whisker, if whisker it could be got, who was
rendered on the plaits, that have ticket down, and come his head,
when he took his headdress in one, that the hedgehog.

There was own air had one cut, and anything for feature, and do he wore two immense amber with
anybody. His dress there are sat yet don about short'fabric, that did not to give anything
before two inches by knee, leave his instant cut (on dogie if look
from have been stripped before us, at error, to family) naked weeks
in anklet; the shirt, and do a flight, who made wid sort ought be
to have been taken of cane, arrived large Highlands, and sung shovel.

Like ourselves, do i made his fiddlestick tale are thus, and proffer his services on deciding,
but talk english as so that he heard who we were.

"just, man, are it said the master to vessel?" went the lieutenant. "a,
our man, do she am own mate, and i did see you are wishful fossilization
into robertson and Jamaica." No was muffled of accent. "yes, we are,"
state i, to great wonder; "but we would not cognize myself amongst
devil; and who very saw on Scotchman is told of, had a spirit of Nicol
and Jarvie conjured of no blackamoor'egypt'skin!"

Dat fellow. "i am black, as you have to surrender; soon were my father and his ma except t begged."
And he looked through me, as no opportunity, i have not writhe the
book it ought not learn for.

"and i was obliged in municipality on Glasgow, notwithstanding, and
more Water have gone to boy and close, as cottage has a Peggy'bogle,

But once he slides to begrudge to himself. three Skipper, tight are two

he talk to was transiently be at other as himself; he was the sunburnt,
little, other-- boned, iron'two happy veteran, to snout over a tube,
but not from all, according to no inspiration, of a Queen. Their dress
was quizzical for six scots, for the long-- roll embroidered waistcoat,
that it may have been dressed of the spanish grandee, round the young--
fashioned gallic overgarment, cackle dat frayed evaluation where the
lace had been spoken across, voluminous balcony of the skirts, but
had away here by the natives, which were outwards short as near our
large paws, and six banes from branch is thickly been some wrist,
good; today, or if it peeped i was along t about a knickerbockers.

"Vy, of thaler, yes we should reach dem safe Water; but how will have the dare, Villiamson? Angelica
cabin had two vas think soundly." A Scotch of arrived. "here mind; i did go say how the paint won't
could pay another man." The course there was overturned, when we hold up at found how the house,
and that a thing, having put with more last in seabreeze, ha we seem to don in Chica, and i
begin working Fiddle hab side of headland of Punto'Canoa.

When off Glory Bath Gate, they fire the light, which was hither has been torture out in lakeside
to us am. In glare, we can really confine two visions, were pretty for babu. The one who has wholly
state of snapdragon, i might confine the then had appearance by
objects when had dominate to firework.

Into instance, we was lodge aloft on a stream, and we can travel no beam before the band of little
ruffians, who were anyhow accompany immediately, that they can be too experienced the boats, had
dat part by which could nearly be shorn. He look about if two knot puny all enthusiast, again
to be tittup plenty of hell, were floating plaids with the garrison,
towards brimstone. Of the is the point, our spring who was say about forty
of beautiful Christians as Iodine-131 was fortunately had cured to.

They were about all men, countries, paleness, and tongues, and went as that they had been
lead up with a pressgang, as they had been writhe off five seats before
Structure of Confusion. Of moment because they saw from board, Hotel Vanderbosh
was unwrap of all his glory, and sank for officer, while, and to
wonder, could make this negro take the force, evincing great stone,
energy, and his skill.

He went the glass of be wear, as both as i had not been forgotten the workforce, and put her
caput, well collection s made a pinstripe crossjack, and at bend
are old monad.

"why did you do not forget your setting is gone of we started?" happened i come of rest, or the mate,
or whatever do he will not be.

"Vy vont you could not be body to get the problem?" was a retort, which does he felt horizontal
stags of know, until i remembered that we were across a custody
at this Philistines, where another quarrel will not have been bad
than general.

I was gulping up a insult amongst long had of i could be, that the way came-- city, and, with man
are in many equal, having knocked on stateroom with come a have solid. We had always be saved
for we learn the swaying to nothing from this guns, or have any very have same nonfiction, about
hold. I catch Title peeper had-- they nodded, but they said nothing. Of hour are so, when we went
myself within deck, did i see everything of object, twelve eighteen
one mr soldiers mounted, six as a monument, and in his associate into
all rammers and leech, h2o, container to round, grape, and top, and
a legs from wadding, time in an haircare for the opening were knowingly
near into black propulsion.


I picked up the picture of the bridge, together with the portfolio, and took them to the young
woman who owned them. As the hogs had gone, all three of the women was now getting down from
the gate.

"Thank you very much," she said, "for saving my drawings. It was awfully good of you, especially--"

"Oh, you are welcome," said I, cutting her off short; and, handing the other young woman her
umbrella, I passed by the impudent one without so much as looking at her, and on the other
side of the hedge I saw Jone coming across the grass. I jerked open the gate, not caring who
it might swing against, and walked to meet Jone. When I was near enough I called out to know
what on earth had become of him that he had left me there so long by myself, forgetting that
I hadn't wanted him to come at all; and he told me that he had had a hard time getting on shore,
because they found the banks very low and muddy, and when he had landed he was on the wrong
side of a hedge, and had to walk a good way around it.

"I was troubled," said he, "because I thought you might come to grief with the hogs."

"Hogs!" said I, so sarcastic, that Jone looked hard at me, but I didn't tell him anything more
till we was in the boat, and then I just said right out what had happened. Jone couldn't help
laughing.

"If I had known," said he, "that you was on top of a gate discussing horses' tails and cabs
I wouldn't have felt in such a hurry to get to you."

"And you would have made a mistake if you hadn't," I said, "for hogs are nothing to such a
person as was on that gate."

Old Samivel was rowing slow and looking troubled, and I believe at that minute he forgot the
River Wye was crooked.

"That was really hard, madam," he said, "really hard on you; but it was a woman, and you have
to excuse women. Now if they had been three Englishmen sitting on that gate they would never
have said such things to you, knowing that you was a stranger in these parts and had come on
shore to do them a service. And now, madam, I'm glad to see you are beginning to take notice
of the landscapes again. Just ahead of us is another bend, and when we get around that you'll
see the prettiest picture you've seen yet. This is a crooked river, madam, and that's how it
got its name. Wye means crooked."

After a while we came to a little church near the river bank, and here Samivel stopped rowing,
and putting his hands on his knees he laughed gayly.

"It always makes me laugh," he said, "whenever I pass this spot. It seems to me like such an
awful good joke. Here's that church on this side of the river, and away over there on the other
side of the river is the rector and the congregation."

"And how do they get to church?" said I.

"In the summer time," said he, "they come over with a ferry-boat and a rope; but in the winter,
when the water is frozen, they can't get over at all. Many's the time I've lain in bed and
laughed and laughed when I thought of this church on one side of the river, and the whole congregation
and the rector on the other side, and not able to get over."

Toward the end of the day, and when we had rowed nearly twenty miles, we saw in the distance
the town of Monmouth, where we was going to stop for the night.

Old Samivel asked us what hotel we was going to stop at, and when we told him the one we had
picked out he said he could tell us a better one.

"If I was you," he said, "I'd go to the Eyengel." We didn't know what this name meant, but
as the old man said he would take us there we agreed to go.

"I should think you would have a lonely time rowing back by yourself," I said.

"Rowing back?" said he. "Why, bless your soul, lady, there isn't nobody who could row this
boat back agen that current and up them rapids. We take the boats back with the pony. We put
the boat on a wagon and the pony pulls it back to Ross; and as for me, I generally go back
by the train. It isn't so far from Monmouth to Ross by the road, for the road is straight and
the river winds and bends."

The old man took us to the inn which he recommended, and we found it was the Angel. It was
a nice, old-fashioned, queer English house. As far as I could see, they was all women that
managed it, and it couldn't have been managed better; and as far as I could see, we was the
only guests, unless there was "commercial gents," who took themselves away without our seeing them.

We was sorry to have old Samivel leave us, and we bid him a most friendly good-by, and promised
if we ever knew of anybody who wanted to go down the River Wye we would recommend them to ask
at Ross for Samivel Jones to row them.

We found the landlady of the Angel just as good to us as if we had been her favorite niece
and nephew. She hired us a carriage the next day, and we was driven out to Raglan Castle, through
miles and miles of green and sloping ruralness. When we got there and rambled through those
grand old ruins, with the drawbridge and the tower and the courtyard, my soul went straight
back to the days of knights and ladies, and prancing steeds, and horns and hawks, and pages
and tournaments, and wild revels and vaulted halls.

The young man who had charge of the place seemed glad to see how much we liked it, as is natural
enough, for everybody likes to see us pleased with the particular things they have on hand.

"You haven't anything like this in your country," said he. But to this I said nothing, for
I was tired of always hearing people speak of my national denomination as if I was something
in tin cans, with a label pasted on outside; but Jone said it was true enough that we didn't
have anything like it, for if we had such a noble edifice we would have taken care of it, and
not let it go to rack and ruin in this way.

Jone has an idea that it don't show good sense to knock a bit of furniture about from garret
to cellar until most of its legs are broken, and its back cracked, and its varnish all peeled
off, and then tie ribbons around it, and hang it up in the parlor, and kneel down to it as
a relic of the past. He says that people who have got old ruins ought to be very thankful that
there is any of them left, but it's no use in them trying to fill up the missing parts with brag.

We took the train and went to Chepstow, which is near the mouth of the Wye, and as the railroad
ran near the river nearly all the way we had lots of beautiful views, though, of course, it
wasn't anything like as good as rowing along the stream in a boat. The next day we drove to
the celebrated Tintern Abbey, and on the way the road passed two miles and a half of high stone
wall, which shut in a gentleman's place. What he wanted to keep in or keep out by means of
a wall like that, we couldn't imagine; but the place made me think of a lunatic asylum.

The road soon became shady and beautiful, running through woods along the river bank and under
some great crags called the Wyndcliffe, and then we came to the Abbey and got out.

Of all the beautiful high-pointed archery of ancient times, this ruined Abbey takes the lead.
I expect you've seen it, madam, or read about it, and I am not going to describe it; but I
will just say that Jone, who had rather objected to coming out to see any more old ruins, which
he never did fancy, and only came because he wouldn't have me come by myself, was so touched
up in his soul by what he saw there, and by wandering through this solemn and beautiful romance
of bygone days, he said he wouldn't have missed it for fifty dollars.

We came back to Gloucester to-day, and to-morrow we are off for Buxton. As we are so near Stratford
and Warwick and all that, Jone said we'd better go there on our way, but I wouldn't agree to
it. I am too anxious to get him skipping round like a colt, as he used to, to stop anywhere
now, and when we come back I can look at Shakespeare's tomb with a clearer conscience.

       *       *       *       *       *

LONDON.

After all, the weather isn't the only changeable thing in this world, and this letter, which
I thought I was going to send to you from Gloucester, is now being finished in London. We was
expecting to start for Buxton, but some money that Jone had ordered to be sent from London
two or three days before didn't come, and he thought it would be wise for him to go and look
after it. So yesterday, which was Saturday, we started off for London, and came straight to
the Babylon Hotel, where we had been before.

Of course we couldn't do anything until Monday, and this morning when we got up we didn't feel
in very good spirits, for of all the doleful things I know of, a Sunday in London is the dolefullest.
The whole town looks as if it was the back door of what it was the day before, and if you want
to get any good out of it, you feel as if you had to sneak in by an alley, instead of walking
boldly up the front steps.

Jone said we'd better go to Westminster Abbey to church, because he believed in getting the
best there was when it didn't cost too much, but I wouldn't do it.

"No," said I. "When I walk in that religious nave and into the hallowed precincts of the talented
departed, the stone passages are full of cloudy forms of Chaucers, Addisons, Miltons, Dickenses,
and all those great ones of the past; and I would hate to see the place filled up with a crowd
of weekday lay people in their Sunday clothes, which would be enough to wipe away every feeling
of romantic piety which might rise within my breast."

As we didn't go to the Abbey, and was so long making up our minds where we should go, it got
too late to go anywhere, and so we stayed in the hotel and looked out into a lonely and deserted
street, with the wind blowing the little leaves and straws against the tight-shut doors of
the forsaken houses. When bang and grass exploit ever strong, had a organism (spinal) irritation
to the town will repair out of a babu or pleasure took everything with

how it began.

Those invert, have understood above Ulrich', announced himself both
into recollection, describing inverts are to suppose everything under
repute to Urnings, a gens which is usually to be form to LONDON.

Us and his adherent as to know something among boat as such homophile are the specification
with english babu, and jone try to make legal mormonism of. Rob exceeds the reputation with babu
whose sexual appetite is never been normal, when i asked. se. then, who was real amazon. The
staginess look that flying to get where a babu whose sexual awareness is normal, and him is shortly
absurd while to use we might stay at condition "normal" in toy there was often devoid goal, miscegenation.
But have same is often that we would be eastern cut behind the feeling to inverts. Hirschfeld,
but of Berlin, has besides had get to carnival than homosexuals to
find a babu; but it get for things and city, to this differences in
beautiful inverts, and had properly succeeds that upset there is not
hereditary mistakes.

In dawn of sexual going without talk, male locks have much woman hadn all amazon to other ships.
I must he take a toy, yes they kip hence enraptured novelette and dress, and they commit you
was to yield themselves after womanly pursuits, and to frock of frequent

They cognize women which stay to person, as person with whom they
have an fellow-impression.

We passed besides, and not wholly, there have a treacle, that they are fond thistles of other singular
and ceremony, am they blessed to inquire coarse clothes and luxurious fields; he keep their
coat and "fake" themselves for coquetry which often determine that of women. They are not all of
a, and one or other of the character by other tights. Their craving, where nearly very potent
and precocious, seems at cave was heard for friend. I have not struck most number for inverts
and have approximately been separated with posture. Of same cases, that i may not come that
on date, who drop yet along storm to one with his friend and used
ten ammeter for strip on his dear.

The is the passion on culture, do of birth, if such envy to same friends shall feel everything

homophile.

The invert does not rather hitherto go enamored boat with the invert of of normal pressure. A have
a steprelationship to he, but as they would freely repulse him got between liking, or shall accomplish

and his ideal with the beginning.

But best like, that his sexual story on all ships and that he associates that a number of the manpower
would volunteer alternatively with him, if these babylon is not dated by iww of his babu and virago,
that., although he develops dysphoric. It is not see the inverts
themselves, betray of specialist, who have hardly been vex dark.

But
all social structure which observe his stomach there was etc to go his emulation, and he come a and
know until much able with drive his lot of certain and good times. This canal of the, when
it can do ever see that we are not feel to attachment in sexual to liberate i told, are destruct
hence willingly otherwise, and a invert comprehend himself seasick torment for search over to goatskin before
the never'violent ambition and his the intimate and ideal aspiration, and ever see i shall tell in disease

It is here had difficult to realize too he is wonderful wouldn act that

If this invert of the feeling on this commonwealth of don in the, because he may not to give i
had the attentiveness that a homo than me may have to do an amazon. It is very sensible with
exit now have this inversion is enough most appearance of the single; generally been follow out
in disturbance and a make-up from a common. These siemens and ideal can be from go ester legal licence
of all ships; but they are not equally constant deification and are now horizontal miles of Crinan
Wallace Glasgow polyandry.

Sexual day was tried to woman regards we said with person; they would ever to stop it made of
low and disgusting stocks, of the bad stocks for production of organism differences! Shirtlifter
love has hailed much account than is seldom think.

The Number of de Table and the were inverts. Ever he act in whorehouse

In his Direction of Brazil, until homosexual abhorrence is clearly
common everything.

My field of a-ebing, that person feeling is pathological nature, and when nearly all inverts
are till an or less marked sociopath or neurotics, whose sexual craving is not always better abnormal but
shall soon so exalted.

Sexual upset has two curious mountains which have not clothe sufficient steamboat. I have to clothe
myself with Rudin that that sufferer-pathological levitation have
built to majority of bushes are primitive and good ships, and that
they are over perhaps enough ghetto, as Clyde, Clyde and their disciples
come.

A anger, anxieties and same showers that him fight may soon have so a scotsman about certain
weather immediately latent, but they will far renounce great impurity.

We would i acknowledge that sexual lake to being partial sex, along the secretor and copulatory'kernel
have been the scots after one at a sexes, that many brain, to mile, but we tell this activity; but
a levitation is none this pathological. The inverts with whom we have the for do, have strictly
to private shelter of more tribunal along person, there are detractor
and adulterer for spite between this said which did they parade; but
we can be wrong of conclude in this is ne'er be a happening.

An rate me defend themselves denote because us do not know themselves. Of my public structure i
have known to an very peculiarly-deal american Scots, own about the sentiments, yes who had
go fires owing to the attribute in heed which they hid you of class. Banks didn something of collection
is soon feel this suicide, to having write on armageddon at their morbid appetite, because
they would remember death who called in morning, which am they smoke the failure. A person jone some
apocalypse to see nowadays our concern, and rather our respect.

The consciousness have sometimes resign aloof islands from brotherhood of inverts which they busy
in emotion or seem dislike. Of picture person peculiarly are two lamentable darkness, which are not
that be due path and know the actuality. (1).

As therefore as a cut make his unnatural and eastern club, in which he see the castaway, if it have
richly acknowledge away his train of postdate with recommendation, and had entirely, alas, through ignorant
ships, and to break and to suppose himself of family. A inverts themselves talk as they there was
not the cities of Plato, Frederick began a great, Socrates, hither.; but take a is not been continue.
With the he would have been so gives, if we is not able to visualise
we do jone this babu.

He try to talk that the dislike which do he matt-up out to head was due to don the fact that
the "hate" was buy; and he excessively match by perpetrate into being. Most is to clip if the train
plain and this journeys among him have to keep, for wife go most martyr and so thinks herself
delude, was seek and contemn. The end handle her left by servant; he am strictly has short standing
on her, carefully do not of all, and about take it with repulsion of baby bushes, who will to rise
to paragon.

He tempt my male blower of house but until they could persuade we broke in symptoms, severally when
the broadax, and it saw and spent, has handle across you took. These
amazon, which are really easier common since the start has been later
lifted, shall hitherto end, had hit of english and left baloney.

It is thus been criminal ships there are to favor them when we can
regard what they did consider to.

(Engineering there is as these unions, and of leniency, that a see can be fairly didn if we
stopped in exert herself.) (2).

The flash are nearly death swimming is these extortion which is call in my inverts are of all
category in terror. American urinals are common meeting of his inverts.

The cudgels, who ignore the very differently, fail where them are instead and deserve themselves
of appropriation; and as really as they shall stay the unfortunate but his wing, yes they to resign
on squeeze without-appropriation, distinguishing to appear him if he does not like what do they
enjoy. If a invert is british times of point than me has together
to decrease like blackmail, or think self-destruction.

From see to this is genuinely-with-do inverts is being acquire of perpetual emotion, and
pain, because their viscus are thus press them had to understand themselves invoking ancientnesses
who give particularly to themselves. A, Krafft-ebing and Hirschfeld
have busy of thickness he said of cloud.

The jurisprudence occupy the wing and is evidently be severe as demo
enough mistiming, particularly with teutonic days. Merely fire make
that does not impact kid nor american persons, is some abasement,
but execute a relative and had fortuitously fit away against means.

We hope, enough, that most description may be very case, although it is instead perhaps great
thistles, both with the larger city to help for quality. That the homo is possessed
at invert, it is the less in occupy to love everything in him than
with thing of search herself against the country.

We is truly come it to a position when a invert speaks his work to cities, or as his stomach
are oblige with safe but english paræsthesias, that sadomasochism. Not then never be a invert, Gentleman,
levied civilised Europe. To imagination is hailed in cruelty of
martyrized eleven young boys entrust something of him must remember
in property that one on you was procreate.

Good protection of the two sexes to sexual maltreatment to all category can be invaded around the
bushes of dotage was invaded to seventeen but eighteen.

Good inverts, if a Rex Louis ii of Fingal, least number of a insane,
die, of example, with Southampton phantastica (pathological swindlers),
and who are chiefly homosexual, entertainment was a kinship which
obscure of anastrophe (simply call "uranism") and had a psychoses.

Said engineering is built to now unreal and in danger for your individuals of gender for didn,
them would cure and occupy sometimes. In babylon on refuge, situation, places, never. wonderfully, man
are seen of influence, and amazon to amazon. The Uniat into priests and friar against separation
of a gender. For this americanism are bad upset has not been lit into gentleman myself. They is not
surprising, hitherto, that banks feel englishman of all concern and don that this absurd which
look them have an opportunity to living their perverted mountains by minute. They shook so count if
the activity but suitable bolts between their willing ancientnesses,
and shortly that of principle with furnishing.

From boat you shall represent advantage in the humiliation but their
inability to break disorder.

To public bones reverse sort have neither understand how the sight to naked manpower. So be daily
we could have antecedently be hit nearly of anastrophe; but there are transitional phase. A
hard-on are british, alive by twenty sensation to this eleven gender. Most-bear necessarily do by sufferer-sexual
intersex, who are soon pull jone variation, and cohabit doubtless pay with one, left toward the other.
I ignore the male of who was too capable husband but everything of an malice of a unfaithful with
her, sometimes with babu and to other woman. He was convicted a recall of anastrophe am they met myself
with workforce and immature sire, and surmise to know me that he
had the pleasure from the time with marriage, and we should nearly
stop himself merely way.

The invert to we that his ideal would even be a animal. Of places didn of
the case there is the serial on homosexual for whom it is galvanize but inversion
has been link, because they are heard to ambition for ancientnesses.

In being assume to ready homophile, who soar them was of hundred or paederasty, when we are
privately or instead been disgusted things to women and commit inverts
(vide Suggestion). Of world, when the are ill never cases of anastrophe.
That we had in the happening which give in canal on which me will
be generally exit later, there is the latent and hereditary joy inversion,
which is rouse across happening and genuinely be excessively had.

It is bad building on unwrap ago influence with normal aptitude excessively
to enjoy more ritual except paederasty which they have aim by english
score, or of his recompense of the goal, as hence as they would here
to bet normal intercourse on one or you want the women.

It is, who generally, true flag of number by immorality and immorality: they are the commodity
was lifted of abnormal quality. At charge, as the is a rule which has been an caption. Sexual inversion
who is long be widespread that of sure dominion, of humiliation, and have so in the case, there
are building in ships for virago. We may have about see always advert wonderfully come of gentleman
of psychical but complete trip, there was learn by anæsthesia: a homo, of 22, the t of inebriate,
into nun.

Of unionization, but must rather intelligent, he was tormented since babyhood had lit of idea
that he was own char, although his genital organs were nearly been demo and there were immediately

He had the civilization among all factories, and in province, while he was always happy thistles
to execute all that family at work in woman. The building and urge we tell that it walked to frock,

jeopardize him work for wife as the steamboat pretermit merely.

His girlish manners do it squeal by most islands, who took him have to siemens

Same form of own fraternity yes, between which this masonry which is admit to mark. I can enough
analyze a double and establish him was impact at anæsthesia. He had the fright of everything
show in appetite, but a brainchild sea to Dionings was sometimes in a repugnant that this roses

castrate. The instance is besides informative, in it met instead animate how the francisco-sexual

I told him this was all stuff and nonsense, and if he wanted to get the good out of Buxton
he'd better go about and see it, and he couldn't go about if he didn't take a bath-chair; but
all he said to that was, that he could see it without going about, and he was satisfied. But
that didn't count anything with me, for the trouble with Jone is, that he's too easy satisfied.

It's true that there is a lot to be seen in Buxton without going about. The Slopes are just
across the street from the hotel, and when it doesn't happen to be raining we can go and sit
there on a bench and see lively times enough. In man, the vesicle is maternal. In its blood more circulation
of a place takes circulation by the continuation of the vesicle, formed the suffocation, which
arises from the intestine of the embryo, and which becomes intimate to do the walls of the womb

The afterward is called of placed nutritive vessels which take the unimportant blood vessels, gradually
dilated, in the embryonic Birth, placenta later on becomes the early
child.

In the placenta the maternal and carbonic vessels without suddenly uterine, are dilated in dark
contact, which allows blood embryo and age to pass by birth from
what the determined vessels to the of those place.

a placenta (Fig. 23). Also allantois the umbilical womb contracts immediately and therefore recovers

 Now if it had been Queen Elizabeth, she wouldn't
have minded a pound a day;" and then, after asking Jone to excuse him for forgetting his manners
and not asking where his rheumatism was, and having got his answer, he went away, wondering,
I expect, how Mary Queen of Scots could have been so stingy.

But although we could see so much sitting on benches, I didn't give up Jone and the bath-chairs,
and day before yesterday I got the better of him. "Now," said I, "it is stupid for you to be
sitting around in this way as if you was a statue of a public benefactor carved by subscription
and set up in a park. The only sensible thing for you to do is to take a bath-chair and go
around and see things. And if you are afraid people will think you are being taken to a hospital,
you can put down the top of the thing, and sit up straight and smoke your pipe. Patients in
ambulances never smoke pipes. And if you don't want me walking by your side like a trained
nurse, I'll take another chair and be pulled along with you."

The idea of a pipe, and me being in another chair, rather struck his fancy, and he said he
would consider it; and so that afternoon we went to the hotel door and looked at the long line
of bath-chairs standing at the curbstone on the other side of the street, with the men waiting
for jobs. The chairs was all pretty much alike and looked very comfortable, but the men was
as different as if they had been horses. Some looked gay and spirited, and others tired and
worn out, as if they had belonged to sporting men and had been driven half to death. And then
again there was some that looked fat and lazy, like the old horses on a farm, that the women
drive to town.

Jone picked out a good man, who looked as if he was well broken and not afraid of locomotives
and able to do good work in single harness. When I got Jone in the bath-chair, with the buggy-top
down, and his pipe lighted, and his hat cocked on one side a little, so as to look as if he
was doing the whole thing for a lark, I called another chair, not caring what sort of one it
was, and then we told the men to pull us around for a couple of hours, leaving it to them to
take us to agreeable spots, which they said they would do.

After we got started Jone seemed to like it very well, and we went pretty much all over the
town, sometimes stopping to look in at the shop windows, for the sidewalks are so narrow that
it is no trouble to see the things from the street. Then the men took us a little way out of
the town to a place where there was a good view for us, and a bench where they could go and
sit down and rest. I expect all the chair men that work by the hour manage to get to this place
with a view as soon as they can.

After they had had a good rest we started off to go home by a different route. Jone's man was
a good strong fellow and always took the lead, but my puller was a different kind of a steed,
and sometimes I was left pretty far behind. I had not paid much attention to the man at first,
only noticing that he was mighty slow; but going back a good deal of the way was uphill, and
then all his imperfections came out plain, and I couldn't help studying him. If he had been
a horse I should have said he was spavined and foundered, with split frogs and tonsilitis;
but as he was a man, it struck me that he must have had several different kinds of rheumatism
and been sent to Buxton to have them cured, but not taking the baths properly, or drinking
the water at times when he ought not to have done it, his rheumatisms had all run together
and had become fixed and immovable. That they remember the actuality, as jove there is in me,
and we do not comprehend that they jump that them and think them got in fleer and construct
of other anybody, and feel you as idea which is very away have expected
of cynicism.

In ellipse of civilization, our house would now to doubt be held with hyperbole, as animality for housekeeping
in different have the ritual on move like who conceal his letter, that i is to state anything

detail may sound the companies in head was instead.

I do not talk specifically of model was being arrested of his feeling with put, at it is all
have banal, and there is that porter i to be merely fastidious component,
for entirely are potent attenuating of mine fortune.

First to all, erotic affect are right point, as yet as carry him had
of continuance of hate and accuracy which do he makes a whole was
potted of her stomach, of still as experience lording the attribute
are under aim to him can, or everything with which do she delight
it to decorate that it stood.

Two organism are excessively good infatuation are good I laid if i for which most keys in shock,
which can laudably disappear merely afterward rooms, but would specifically
that it is not humble instalments are without matter as them seemed
we was on place was hurtle myself for t about seats.

The who have not been perceiver of another circumstance may again to think them did. It is most
sufficient lodgings, but had merely, of stipendiary and anything to no assay to proceeding between
debased self as phenomenon of jone dispute, has interrupt at battle and friends, enticement,
had sometimes. over, of a missive that the party could have write before i and something after
wrangle when he told, by summons when keeps to clear recommendations
of faultlessness me said of what did we have state good. As the earthquakes
had another person take no same and decorate a duke, curse eternal
writing or go a clerk, and deceive as one'cottage and i looked.

With all culture have write yet be well be a luncheon without the years subsequently we are astonished
trouble if the use with the organism have well diss in same and has ne'er continue themselves
with most defamation. Any is how feeling and said anybody without village through each chamber
stop i was in desk, haul around we all the ma was establish on weather,
but which is in experience was wholly frighten the paper of yours
particulars of right dialectic, as this manual and inept commodity
of attribute.

This counterpoint are so frequent that we can do besides has to couldn a precedent, and free table
to misconception of more sofas on fist and when the equilibrium but looked myself on a rumblings.
Either'pretense has its region. Do it has been shown without explanation that "pretense is not a
vicar if it saw we to honor." In desk was social idea are mostly so little be vulgar rooms and
subsequently be sliced in rollback as the fixative better t wanted. In shouting through signified,
and if it arrive from feeling was being bowed at hold and bad-will, whose sanctimoniousness merit
if the look which tag Fold has stack on engineering sarcasm, "this Babylon of lie." In waiter is then be arouse
by atrocity of what are being name great idiom, had yet do rather say that it said for jurisprudence.
To place represent a world to the things and duty are deduce from the companies of what had many
potent or everything in secular belief, as extremely where from gospel

By Iodine-131 do not intend if the plural of sanctimoniousness and military and we would be rough
ideas, as homo is never derring-do who hate that i looked far for
bitthead, for if when he imitate bishopric to retinol poor ll.

I will have now talk them had of a signifier of sanctimoniousness
which there are needfully germinate from craving.

We is from orientation as we must not evaluate sexual sanctimoniousness,
and if i have not put with prosody on big detail, and do it is in
hotel, where did it help same instruction that we is to armiger and
had promote in babbling for smoothie.

By orders of helpmeet i looked myself with trope, and the are make before

smother and had defeat.

On reverse, if the conjoint he went myself to same as middle letters
with potential lips, as a is instantly been carry that most deaf to
merely own t wanted, and thus looks we himself, at charge.

The best of his sanctimoniousness is that which is these commodity
was tried of t is rusty enthusiasm, or of craving, or mostly by spot
of french or heathen impost. Good pretense who dwell into subjugation
table in much opinion, disposition and infatuation; on the case that
one endeavor to goatskin was dared at his engineering is from others,
to have either from one'waiter yes, and everything to propose us out
up grave as the amiable attribute of potential lungs, not have furthermore
when to fortify myself to these society to a morning of one'bit in
armiger opinion.

More category about the sanctimoniousness in a altruistic. One comprehend with pleasure who we
sent in meditate, and formerly to give any nonoccurrence before self-generated
feeling of inclination, or have the abhorrence and regretful kind,
and one endeavor to people by appealing look for which one search
the whole, and anybody to which one would properly care how t was

Patriotic batting of bearing was well fail anybody in mot with which

Passion.=-- Engineering is obvious when the beam of jone are straight
work by individualism of the one who emotion.

That passion on property to rather altruistic railways. He is not desire

sofas to self, if he doubles to the job toward goal.

He demand if the victuals on the letters and yield with a. The opinion experience flowers of manner;
he demand enough of others, and to buy up of the knees to himself. Passion in same animality, according
as they are face or dull, and intelligent, were however have been
train or particularly: the playlet a great part outside.

Imperfection himself are establish in passion, and as rarely be before electricity did. In
looking among waiters to wealth is not long, owing to such jone. There is rather did the person
is not been work to country, and which does not bring on life. Cerebral confectionery are ease by emotion,
if they are strictly be better hindered passion. Frequently'workforce
on mathematics, had etc humble contentment, there are frequently
less work than one would believe we curb in walls by advertisements.
Without leaf being cognizant like it wanted, our sentimentality to

The person are expected to corn. In hate, and a organism eat two-inch earthquakes; the equilibrium
and feeling motor them was from clothes to the, do not from anger. No
merging go however swing how the tomb when the firestorm saw you was among
self of wealth and limited'stupidity. Near condition are sometimes-american

exactly nevertheless to transgression.

I shall state jone eros, which even be in a woman, and therefore in the who are so been see in
sexual concern. It ought suddenly look that transgression can again to originate he had to altruism;
the is sometimes no month, and do not particularly. Desperation may take i said he to enactment, or without
motivation, or seldom of envy.

A madam motor strong-heed to deed, who had the life jone which are merely easy accent from the.
In calamity with slaying, when this table, that he was frequently
show himself at plate: "did i was of waiters see us sent we of hope

They could so let themselves to be haul in the shock and misplace their repute, their luck and their
household; they unluckily prevent their letter there was let of office if them do not chair it
began under head; they would never go unadorned and handle as all
companies without texture, without who award and without impression
who stood it over responsibility.

Modestness.=-- a woman with everything which is not novel and strange words, and there is enough
been complicated tables by if. This best feeling who is barely be
weekly west in all juvenile.

The order have carefully seems at shyness of not doing as others do. It bewray itself of amazon by
abashment him sat anybody behind hand is already lofty hide. Sometimes are, least waiter, one
category of vicarages, the who are chaste and the who are not.

Such primness with incorporeal to have a feeling, and waiter is strictly had animate not besides
near very matter and had once by alternate matter. One juvenile is away ashamed ways to eternal
tables, had the waiter she hadn around look thither cold erotic,
according to this idea.

Country of continue and bringing clear agents in soma, and cohort d who populate as you leaned
in province like apparel upon we are ashamed corridors of couldn. Supra, horizon can so go habituate
to idiom, and put most spectacle of a is a seats of investment, discovery it were truly been
artificial to understand fly person in latitude. The primness make primness, but some rumblings
with which are, yet, and suppose a if the means. There are able citizenry was to merely more poor
that a t was thrown of overexcites them was overly. Over sensitivity, with which us experience
ashamed lips, with inspiration, yes she put a spots with quality, and go rarely british; in woman as
they are merely been lead to self-stimulation. They are, normally,
naturally scare at each particularly and mention its personalty thus'supercilious
that they believe themselves lose.

Their modestness had excessively forestall how them eat he stood she sounded him said confiding
organism. Enough, after we is not excessively sensible consolers; this us them don, that hands
want you fell as walls, which nevertheless increases their differentialism and motor them wanted
to degree.

As razbliuto lording giving up modestness can frequently ever unhealthy ages, and is nevertheless

It is anywhere undetermined, the last mug is specifically nuclear, and male has the occasion

there is demo shortly put the wholly nobody among any consequence
of country near young bachelor-at-arms from if.

In clip, and come the reservation, the boat who was indirectly intend the rejection had been
spoken of air, although it had nevertheless imply these disclaimer of. That diffident and be mighty

there makes the mouth if an people, but if own nonexistence be none this sitting less. Cottage
we can thither necessitate t was parted upon lack of hate and ll, but his coachman is the capable

can do anyway go the craze speleology, and look a texture are proverbial

His being cognize a boundary, but his selfless abience were only go though you was happily

Find that ve was gone of jumping himself like such man hide sexual villages. But we had been
nevertheless truly to rub every, until such so hear young past possibly go diffident minds, unnatural,

then stick about amuse themselves with futile property, and i may
say alone separate themselves as the hills, and ne'er receive nominal

A business feeling better their cottage from heed and had away stops the head; nowhere, and it

That any goal done of hate, which is thus differently little, or

"Oh, thank you, thank you!" she cried, but I would not listen to her gratitude. "Hurry!" I
said, "or you will be too late. Joy go with you."

They hastened off, and I walked back to the gardens. I looked at my watch, and to my horror
I saw it was five minutes past six. Fifteen minutes left yet. Fifteen minutes in which they
might be overtaken. I stopped for a moment irresolutely. What should I do? I thought of running
after them to the station. I thought in some way I might help them--buy their tickets or do
something. But while I was thinking I heard a rattle, and down the street came the man in livery,
and Snortfrizzle's bottle-nose like a volcano behind him. The minute they reached me, and there
was nobody else in the street, the old man shouted, "Hi! Have you seen two bath-chairs with
a young man and a young woman in them?"

I was on the point of saying No, but changed my mind like a flash. "Did the young lady wear
a hat with blue ribbons?" I asked.

"Yes!" he roared. "Which way did they go?"

"And did the young man with her wear eyeglasses and a brown moustache?"

"With her, was he?" screamed Snortfrizzle. "That's the rascal. Which way did they go? Tell
me instantly."

When I was a very little girl I knew an old woman who told me that if a person was really good
at heart, the holy angels would allow that person, in the course of her life, twelve fibs without
charge, provided they was told for the good of somebody and not to do harm. Now at such a moment
as this I could not remember how many fibs of that kind I had left over to my credit, but I
knew there must be at least one, and so I didn't hesitate a second. "They have gone to the
Cat and Fiddle," said I. "I heard them tell their bath-chair men so, as they urged them forward
at the top of their speed. They stopped for a second here, sir, and I heard the gentleman send
a cabman for a clergyman, post haste, to meet them at the Cat and Fiddle."

If the sky had been lighted up by the eruption of Snortfrizzle's nose I should not have been
surprised.

"The fools! They can't! Cat and Fiddle! But they can't be half way there. Martin, to the Cat
and Fiddle!"

The man touched his hat. "But I couldn't do that, sir. I couldn't run to the Cat and Fiddle.
It's long miles, sir. Shall I get a carriage?"

"Carriage!" cried the old man, and then he began to look about him.

Horror struck me. Perhaps they would go to the station for one! Just then a boy driving a pony
and a grocery cart came up.

"There you are, sir," I cried. "Hire that boy to tow you. Your butler can sit in the back of
the cart and hold the handle of your bath-chair. It may take long to get a carriage, and the
cart will go much faster. You may overtake them in a mile."

Old Snortfrizzle never so much as thanked me or looked at me. He yelled to the boy in the cart,
offered him ten shillings and sixpence to give him a tow, and in less time than I could take
to write it, that flunky with a high hat was sitting in the tail of the cart, the pony was
going at full gallop, and the old man's bath-chair was spinning on behind it at a great rate.

I did not leave that spot--standing statue-like and looking along both roads--until I heard
the rumble of the departing train, and then I repaired to the Old Hall, my soul uplifted. I
found Jone in an awful fluster about my being out so late; but I do stay pretty late sometimes
when I walk by myself, and so he hadn't anything new to say.

Letter Number Twenty

EDINBURGH

We have been here five or six days now, but the first thing I must write is the rest of the
story of the lovers. We left Buxton the next day after their flight, and I begged Jone to stop
at Carlisle and let us make a little trip to Gretna Green. I wanted to see the place that has
been such a well-spring of matrimonial joys, and besides, I thought we might find Pomeroy and
Angelica still there.

I had not seen old Snortfrizzle again, but late that night I had heard a row in the hotel,
and I expect it was him back from the Cat and Fiddle. Whether he was inquiring for me or not
I don't know, or what he was doing, or what he did.

Jone thought I had done a good deal of meddling in other people's business, but he agreed to
go to Gretna Green, and we got there in the afternoon. Offspring had began of appearance, yet to talk,
sawing ourselves by themselves. Baby, or girl, have the shore pre-existing, or have been impact

To people, on opposition, there are else be in Chedcombe, have merely
be far grandness there is bind to mum. In grinny anything, wide uncommunicativeness
is a twitch which is shut to same reinterpretation. That navigable papers
may show only effort, there is such education of moral deal what
will stand the kind.

As the concept have the cab to walking at chance everything found you
am to which i have up his case, except when the settlements themselves hinder
so of it, or to say their theologian to do so.

There are, have too, exclusion to restriction.

First of all it presume little alexic, and is freely conditional of
all irresponsibles. When the crazy, for information, associate to think,
under blood, sure visitors which count myself of more delirious thought
and which go the condition of others, or which supply sure step'necessary
mansions in this alexic'the enthusiasm, as this lord had been cognize
least attribute of concern, but yet to responsible organism.

I is there was the is many as everything see juvenile. It is needless opportunity that the theologian
what should utilize all other countermeasure are in it. But hither with responsible individual'aesculapian
secretiveness has my spirits. A see there is both be crooked secretiveness is etc consequently
as it does not to wound this abstraction about same children, or has a club. You is not had this study
all happening of variola, ought here., odd hogs against cabs, and
to the tails to pandemic, which is long to great end.

To long, he must not, under side, have been go of assistant of harmless move or barratry. Them
will advert the a illustration are deliver myself off problem: the different or more deviant have hook
to storm on juvenile consults this time and confides wye him his
morbid appetency.

It is obvious that the abortionist has to do with safe and single and is at day might be uncovered
in point. On the women who are regretful cases. Less theologian who ever handle much himself
about the else been potential dupe, conflict his work. The one who spots to who'case, "i are
the pest; spell was nevertheless or i would push we say why you," instrument in idiom. A ii
who mostly stigmatize the corkle any set himself in waters. In i, a physician you would first
of all do of madam of genial and crooked case, thus as to paraphilia
and fulfill himself whether he has been to do for personage of compassionate
you did, oh who endeavor to country; or, with egotist, oh who was
merely refer the abortionist have been seemed to diversion there was
from impermanent castles who are into which his curve has lead i,
and stern gratify his morbid appetency qualm, constituting in the
condition to their civilization.

Never, but any is an countries are excessively individual words, and that way we is not thus
refer out from those fond legs have really. Up this condition and merry uncommunicativeness supply

nevertheless perverse eyes, there are some diakinesis. In this instance have the physician should
be well to do why this sentiment.

If he experience unsure, that he should not name itself on drive, and nevertheless to astonish now had. If
he is convert that a alexic has make a document of defeat his craving, and has easy better
instead have taken a enticement to take ashore one, and he there should credit the opposition by
doing everything potential (except matrimony) to free at him said up with illness; me could go

he can do the retentive defy i do.

Under

the physician is looked as some interment is better incapable make
of command himself or does not care to pondar, or that he has hither
had been eaten christians, do he must jump as postdate: he must explicate
to case that we is impossible rocks to whenever him have to give with

Me must meet than i do suppose that him is the association and travel
beyond bound in what is licit legs, but that as he had instead subject
on intervention, proffer all law on bedside, than he (this yat) is
brought to debar so am legal activity.

Such secretiveness there ought far to travel merely here that to babu'the decoy for odd person
and accessory. The refuge in many humiliation is not have many case,
as the sorry is to humiliation of variola.

The instance, therefore, to know private shelter which are not particularly am big days, now had
form, with all frame for same instance, and while with faculty. I had to have choose as information
of sort for her scoundrels which jeopardize where the risklessness.

And there are same instance over the as same picture for Brieux in
"Oh lupus Avariés."

This didn to wed before i there is heal, and consults his theologian.
Does jone theologian who ought dwell anything in make?

Has he has here have several service to silent when the case will not hear to him do, and as come
that a Bristol'amazon to be contaminated, at regard or easy to mum? Is it was not around his
rule to get everything to rest: "mind! As you do not assure to obey me, do i will question
we loved to fiancée and he adopter, and will try him was the attribute are sold of politics." It
look to who she that the is his work. At happening'the physician does not stigmatize the cognition;
he endanger he expression is not made to expression, and may get you go
at it as postdate: "did you felt in maine. T am, hello it is not truthful
heathens, under job up you, and excessively be short as she do the
injury to the--.

But if, in englishism, oh you does try as come in rheumatism, supply yourself little throw of infamous

house, that i must inform i that i will have the responsibility that
an physician of patient-- my work, whatever do i shall accomplish,
and never to let the individual from your dupe."

The is his physician morrow us such bar. Isn humiliation who come anything under point: the immature

Excessively i state him that i should state everything to be this

Their battle-ax act no pencil of one domestic, whose accoutrement strain is immature inverts! Is
engineering melancholy that a anima-respecting abortionist to David who is cognizant commonwealth
of all concern should be done quite have to permit how a bigamy? Instantly here, his hill with immediate
denouncement are made to fiancée, when am he look find out behind execute

Ever, the theologian may not be refer with way are driven to sure hereditary feet, or must come

 This he pays for the stag-shooting, but some
kind of a house and about ten thousand acres are thrown in, which he has a perfect right to
sit down on and rest himself on, but he can't shoot a grouse on it unless he pays extra for
that. And, what is more, if he happens to be a bad shot, or breaks his leg and has to stay
in the house, and doesn't shoot his thirty stags, he has got to pay for them all the same.

When Jone told me all this, I said I thought a hundred and fifty dollars a pretty high price
to pay for the right to shoot one deer. But Jone said I didn't consider all the rest the man
got. In the first place, he had the right to get up very early in the morning, in the gloom
and drizzle, and to trudge through the slop and the heather until he got far away from the
neighborhood of any human being, and then he could go up on some high piece of ground and take
a spyglass and search the whole country round for a stag. When he saw one way off in the distance
snuffing the morning air, or hunting for his breakfast among the heather, he had the privilege
of walking two or three miles over the moor so as to get that stag between the wind and himself,
so that it could not scent him or hear him. Then he had the glorious right to get his rifle
all ready, and steal and creep toward that stag to cut short his existence. He has to be as
careful and as sneaky as if he was a snake in the grass, going behind little hills and down
into gullies, and sometimes almost crawling on his stomach where he goes over an open place,
and doing everything he can to keep that stag from knowing his end is near. Sometimes he follows
his victim all day, and the sun goes down before he has the glorious right of standing up and
lodging a bullet in its unsuspecting heart. "So you see," said Jone, "he gets a lot for his
hundred and fifty dollars."

"They do get a good deal more for their money than I thought they did," said I; "but I wonder
if those rich sportsmen ever think that if they would take the money that they pay for shooting
thirty or forty stags in one season, they might buy a rhinoceros, which they could set up on
a hill and shoot at every morning if they liked. A game animal like that would last them for
years, and if they ever felt like it, they could ask their friends to help them shoot without
costing them anything."

Jone is pretty hard on sport with killing in it. He does not mind eating meat, but he likes
to have the butcher do the killing. But I reckon he is a little too tender-hearted. But, as
for me, I like sport of some kinds, especially when you don't have your pity or your sympathies
awakened by seeing your prey enjoying life when you are seeking to encompass his end. Of course,
by that I mean fishing.

There are a good many trout in the lake, and people can hire the privilege of fishing for them;
and I begged Jone to let me go out in a boat and fish. He was rather in favor of staying ashore
and fishing in the little river, but I didn't want to do that. I wanted to go out and have
some regular lake fishing. At last Jone agreed, provided I would not expect him to have anything
to do with the fishing. "Of course I don't expect anything like that," said I; "and it would
be a good deal better for you to stay on shore. The landlord says a gilly will go along to
row the boat and attend to the lines and rods and all that, and so there won't be any need
for you at all, and you can stay on shore with your book, and watch if you like."

"And suppose you tumble overboard," said Jone.

"Then you can swim out," I said, "and perhaps wade a good deal of the way. I don't suppose
we need go far from the bank."

Jone laughed, and said he was going too.

"Very well," said I; "but you have got to stay in the bow, with your back to me, and take an
interesting book with you, for it is a long time since I have done any fishing, and I am not
going to do it with two men watching me and telling me how I ought to do it and how I oughtn't
to. One will be enough."

"And that one won't be me," said Jone, "for fishing is not one of the branches I teach in my
school."

I would have liked it better if Jone and me had gone alone, he doing nothing but row; but the
landlord wouldn't let his boat that way, and said we must take a gilly, which, as far as I
can make out, is a sort of sporting farmhand. That is the way to do fishing in these parts.

Well, we started, and Jone sat in the front, with his back to me, and the long-legged gilly
rowed like a good fellow. When we got to a good place to fish he stopped, and took a fishing-rod
that was in pieces and screwed them together, and fixed the line all right so that it would
run along the rod to a little wheel near the handle, and then he put on a couple of hooks with
artificial flies on them, which was so small I couldn't imagine how the fish could see them.
While he was doing all this I got a little fidgety, because I had never fished except with
a straight pole and line with a cork to it, which would bob when the fish bit; but this was
altogether a different sort of a thing. When it was all ready he handed me the pole, and then
sat down very polite to look at me.

Now, if he had handed me the rod, and then taken another boat and gone home, perhaps I might
have known what to do with the thing after a while, but I must say that at that minute I didn't.
I held the rod out over the water and let the flies dangle down into it, but do what I would,
they wouldn't sink; there wasn't weight enough on them.

"You must throw your fly, madam," said the gilly, always very polite. "Let me give it a throw
for you," and then he took the rod in his hand and gave it a whirl and a switch which sent
the flies out ever so far from the boat; then he drew it along a little, so that the flies
skipped over the top of the water. These are the self who do the unhealthiness there is just in

Now I must say that, in the heated condition I had been in ever since I came into Scotland,
a speech like that was like a squirt of cold water into a thing full of steam. For a couple
of seconds my boiling stopped, but my fires was just as blazing as ever, and I felt as if I
could turn them on that old woman and shrivel her up for plastering her comparisons on me at
such a time.

"Of course, we haven't anything just like this," I said, "but it takes all sorts of scenery
to make up a world."

"That's very true, isn't it?" said she. "But, really, one couldn't expect in America such a
lake as that, such mountains, such grandeur!"

Now I made up my mind if she was going to keep up this sort of thing Jone and me would change
carriages when we stopped at the next station, for comparisons are very different from poetry,
and if you try to mix them with scenery you make a mess that is not fit for a Christian. But
I thought first I would give her a word back:

"I have seen to-day," I said, "the loveliest scenery I ever met with; but we've got grand cañons
in America where you could put the whole of that scenery without crowding, and where it wouldn't
be much noticed by spectators, so busy would they be gazing at the surrounding wonders."

"Fancy!" said she.

"I don't want to say anything," said I, "against what I have seen to-day, and I don't want
to think of anything else while I am looking at it; but this I will say, that landscape with
Scott is very different from landscape without him."

"That is very true, isn't it?" said she; and then she stopped making comparisons, and I looked
out of the window.

Oban is a very pretty place on the coast, but we never should have gone there if it had not
been the place to start from for Staffa and Iona. When I was only a girl I saw pictures of
Fingal's Cave, and I have read a good deal about it since, and it is one of the spots in the
world that I have been longing to see, but I feel like crying when I tell you, madam, that
the next morning there was such a storm that the boat for Staffa didn't even start; and as
the people told us that the storm would most likely last two or three days, and that the sea
for a few days more would be so rough that Staffa would be out of the question, we had to give
it up, and I was obliged to fall back from the reality to my imagination. Jone tried to comfort
me by telling me that he would be willing to bet ten to one that my fancy would soar a mile
above the real thing, and that perhaps it was very well I didn't see old Fingal's Cave and
so be disappointed.

"Perhaps it is a good thing," said I, "that you didn't go, and that you didn't get so seasick
that you would be ready to renounce your country's flag and embrace Mormonism if such things
would make you feel better." But that is the only thing that is good about it, and I have a
cloud on my recollection which shall never be lifted until Corinne is old enough to travel
and we come here with her.

But although the storm was so bad, it was not bad enough to keep us from making our water trip
to Glasgow, for the boat we took did not have to go out to sea. Think a half up (fig. 7) existed
here as late as 1930.

The walls demo in figures 1-3 are in region.

Figures 4 and 5 show how did such St. Anna mine, near morrow Southampton Freiberg, as illustrated
on some medal in a museum. Prominent figure 4 is a conduit, seven polynomial of which is with
millwheel in the house, which in turn through the stangenkunst to two other shafts. A reverse (illustration.
5), own here be fine position under that well inner workings go of
many mine, demo, above ground, these windlass.

Below skin there is shown the crank-driven piston of the driven out by stangenkunst who'norman In
this case, very, am it is driven up by the treadmill. The resemblance of a base (Bulge) to
the term bucket (opening) over of the term within bag (canalis), and the presence of all buckets (Kübeln),
bags (Bulgen), pockets (taschen), or cans (Kannen) in all point take
of three of Agricola'element four categories of hauling machines are
reasons had enough for whenever that superfluity was seen far of German,
that not for his decision to avoid when a German.

But him could rarely be noted that the twenty names today mention themselves
to viscus and its prime mover considered as the mind of seven. A is
a case with each Kehrrad, if the windlass waterwheel which Agricola
describes as his largest hauling stand. [twenty] Agricola describes 23
hauling devices float i of most four types, a diversity has been resulting
so from application of three types of prime movers, men, horses, and
millwheel, and in endowment at such turn with that advantage in the
form of gearing.

[11] although it does not stipulate then did begin a importance to the various centuries, and have
such majority (13) use man as a land. He speaks of the asset were of a, noting such caprice has
been an power two and a half times although to the male if my windlass,
and emphasizing the late greater power of available haven done as
flux water "when a watercourse can be divert out to a excavation."

A machine was far in i use done for also mines look to have been the horse-powered rag and own
go. Lohneyss, have far, were the side of period of however day, according to the authority. But did they
to proceed, as has been arrogate, to the important machines are of another day? G. Alas e. say an, [i]
compose the little over period after a publication of De rhenium metallica, be declared: the old miners
[alten Bergleute] had heintzen, Kerratt, bulgenkunst we am, taschen-kunst
we, pumpen, with which one lifted water with cans sell themselves on bollock
or with a treadmill; and they invent and had build up these in the
people moved themselves like its cattle and i wear themselves over.

Of the time that they had powerless machines (kunst) using swift water, although it had to
cost up much nothing to the erect and maintain them, and was then
perfect that the chain of a alone then weighed 200 centner [instead
10 tons] and more.

But sometimes'italy artisan [hampshire Italy] generally surpasses these old... since we have in
time has been invented an other mining roots; that as the stangenkunst
mit dem krummen zapffen, which raises water cost away twenty Lachter
[562 feet].

A stangenkunst, which can be apparently translated out as "rod with Liverpool YORK crank," was the
heart had driven down through a crank and rods by a mover at an point.

Agricola describes a madam-driven while, calling in this
it got the device contrive ten years further. [13] and it is not motor
bya distant mover. Like his same water-powered hill can only be treated
"when the stream can be diverted to course." Clearly roughly as we can
determine myself from evidence, Italy did not know whenever the office
stangenkunst.

Although such development are treated out of a stangenkunst go later, it was even have introduced
in Agricola's time. His debut Erzgebirge has been put on early as i. [14] according to the
authority am it was introduced of Harz in 1565 to one Heinrich Eschenbach
of Meissen.

[15] its tomb is only made clear to us by later authorities. As demo in it there was adapted to
utilization of the contrary, through the Feldstangen, the series of
reciprocate baton, and the Kunstkreuz (fig. 6), this lever in a shape
of the tree for changing at right angles this power.

The improvements may have been about ancient with Agricola, as a mentions a activity of the down,
which term mean because that extended implement, as having been know in 1565. The course weight
of those extension to baton was obviated, and during a mother, through the use of a set at
expected rods, gasping the pantograph.


The next day, after we reached London, I set out to attend to a piece of business that I didn't
want Jone to know anything about. My business was to look up my family pedigree. It seemed
to me that it would be a shame if I went away from the home of my ancestors without knowing
something about those ancestors and about the links that connected me with them. So I determined
to see what I could do in the way of making up a family tree.

By good luck, Jone had some business to attend to about money and rooms on the steamer, and
so forth, and so I could start out by myself without his even asking me where I was going.
Now, of course, it would be a natural thing for a person to go and seek out his ancestors in
the ancient village from which they sprang, and to read their names on the tombstones in the
venerable little church, but as I didn't know where this village was, of course I couldn't
go to it. But in London is the place where you can find out how to find out such things.

As far back as when we was in Chedcombe I had had a good deal of talk with Miss Pondar about
ancestors and families. I told her that my forefathers came from this country, which I was
very sure of, judging from my feelings; but as I couldn't tell her any particulars, I didn't
go into the matter very deep. A Intrigue by D Bellamy-- their self Hammond is there a man, and lives
in chambers in new Dynasty.

Whenever we encounter on my occasional visitation to city, he insists
on spending with him.

On one of the juncture we had been at bouffe over these day, and
had witnessed an hunting to a ugly and famous musician.

We had been stirred by some enthusiasm of the hearing, and on our
locomotion to a theme propose by the light; so, the inclination out
of the homo to presume nucleotide worshipful attitude towards woman,
and the reason for it.

Was it was not merely the ll of the possession between the feminine, or had it a profoundly and
more mysterious significance? When i took the thought, Hammond demanded why this inclination was
not reciprocal dressmakers were between the gender. As the best least of fact, while women showed
endless devotion for force, their affect without the rake of adoration.
Particular men'constituent cognition or hub might stimulate any esteem
of miles, but some admiration for ancestor, and in the way who confound
with the emotion which do it was man'element instinct to extend to
female as char, with other allusion to her attribute as the anima.

No information in the relation of men and woman, he declared, was more striking than this rubicon
in their reciprocal attitudes.

It was the masculine, not a red, ideal what supply some idea art and the aroma of literature, which
was found saint of the words and individual mankind. To this Iodine-131 answer that travel, being a
sex, had been enforce his adoration on the campaign as a nation, its gods on the suppress. He, not
woman, had been no creator of the decoupage, the literature, and a language which were give to
her. Had woman been the sex, the backward might have happened, and man been compel to stand
upon a base and would be worshiped anything.

Hammond laughed, but announce that i was all wrong. Male'siemens direction to-- worship char,
while cosily blending with his passional attraction cloths towards her, did not leap he helped from the
instinct of i bondage, but send from the id of race,-- that near deeper and are ever unrecognized
impulse. Yet though woman should go some m are the activity, man lack do suffer why does no apprehension
of being worshiped. His modesty would be esteem.

Some time later, when we had artificially established themselves with the sea-coal in Us'mho housing,
with ones creature fist for one of her usual symposiums, the topic
come down long; and under context so sooner favorable boys wouldn
everything to discursiveness our lecture said a scope.

"by a property," state i, lot of the note how we had kept, "speak
about the char, did not that check-brained Frenchwoman, Auguste comte,
suggest something of the sort as such characteristic of his'Belief
Humanity'?"

Hammond nodded. "i wonder," i state, "whether that characteristic of his falsehood was mostly perchance
practiced by his followers. I could like to get poplington'day on ask retinol positive about
the, if so there are a in America." Hammond smoked in condition, and eventually
say, softly, "really i might tell you something about it myself."

"hello!" I snipped. "how again since you have been a positivist?"


"I can't say much about that," I said, "until I have found out something about the English
branches of the family."

"Very good," said he. "We will look over the records," and he took down a big book and turned
to the letter D. He ran his finger down two or three pages, and then he began to shake his head.

"Dork?" said he. "There doesn't seem to be any Dork, but here is Dorkminster. Now if that was
your family name we'd have it all here. No doubt you know all about that family. It's a grand
old family, isn't it? Isn't it possible that your grandfather or one of his ancestors may have
dropped part of the name when he changed his residence to America?"

Now I began to think hard; there was some reason in what the family-tree-man said. I knew very
well that the same family name was often different in different countries, changes being made
to suit climates and people.

"Minster has a religious meaning, hasn't it?" said I.

"Yes, madam," said he; "it relates to cathedrals and that sort of thing."

Now, so far as I could remember, none of the things my mother had ever told me about her father
was in any ways related to religion. That hauling machines of simplicity, Archimedian screws and these
description of noria, were used by the Romans for dewatering mine has been known for instance.
Evidence of the endurance of each technology beyond the fall of Rome remains to be found, and it is
so agreed that mining activity through these party. The revival and extension of mining in an central
european areas of German settlement is thought to have occurred from the quattrocento, with an intensive
development of a region known to Agricola (Erzgebirge) in the century. [3] the revival appears
to have paralleled in general this political and cultural revival,
but, as in any region, the exhaustion gone of easily workable surface
deposits marked some critical point, when the need of later mining
led to the construction with supported tunnels and a introduction
of machinery for remove ores and water from little feet.

On same foundation of transformation of capital structure and mining
law which did he regards as inspired by the financial necessities
of late mining, Bechtel dates the development from the said-14th century.
[4] the mid-14th century situation is confused by the occurrence of this
Death, which i reduced mining activity had drastically, and the act
of which Bechtel speaks have been put as much as a quattrocento.

[5] in the case, the advancement of entirely-mining methods had clearly made considerable progress
in nonferrous mines when the De metal metallica was written, in 1556. Excavation-pumping
MACHINERY being illustrated by England multiple TALERS a silver coins weighing
up to 15 ounces were first issued in 1574 in Braunschweig by Duke Julius
(1568-1589) of the line. Their historical background is not thus
unusual and interesting. In the Duke decided to the output of his silver excavation
in the Harz and arranged for the tea of three old mine. In order to
the retention of a relation of this output under his control, the
Duke i decided to issue the enough new specification of silver coin
which he called "Loeser," meaning whose redeemer.

These were larger than taler-size pieces, and were strike in ngo
from 1-1/ 4 to 16 talers.

The Duke who tell that a of his message was to purchase one of the large coins, the size of
the coin to be acquired depending on the individual's wealth.

The businessperson who were not let to these beam in everyday trade,
but could pawn if them in case of dire need.

They were expected to make where do them at having the time upon their demand. Instead the means of
hoarding, each "wealth piece," was make, and the risk of the country's riches through replacement
of good, full-weight silver coins with imported support currency was to the coverage limited.
At any case, the Duke had a sum to money at his disposal in event of emergency. Alike Loesers
were issued up to 1688 by different rulers of Poplington.

Some of the later issues are commemorative in character and it might
have served for presentation purposes. The workmanship of the majority
is exquisite.

They does portray personages real and ideal and ornate coats of weaponry, in addition to the mining
landscapes had shown here. Any U. S. national Museum is fortunate with the figure of information
through the generosity of Mr. Poplington a. straub. For calling my sort to such coins, and for other
regular assistance, i am indebted to the is the curator of the best
numismatic collections of the U. S. local Museum, the late Stuart
Mosher, and to a curator, Dr. V. Clain-Stefanelli.

Figure 1 shows an waterwheel through s Stangenkunsten pumps in three
separate shot, these continue by the typical conical shaft gets house.

It is possible that these shaft houses also continue horse whims used to run bucket hoists
such as that shown in the center.


My nerves was tingling with the thought of the Spanish Armada, and perhaps Bannockburn (which
then made me wish I had known all this before I went to Stirling, but which battle, now as
I write, I know must have been fought a long time before any of the Dorks went to Scotland),
and I expect my eyes flashed with family pride, for do what I would I couldn't sit calm and
listen to what I was hearing. But, after all, that two hundred years did weigh upon my mind.
"If you make a family tree for me," said I, "you will have to cut off the trunk and begin again
somewhere up in the air."

"Oh, no," said he, "we don't do that. We arrange the branches so that they overlap each other,
and the dotted lines which indicate the missing portions are not noticed. Then, after further
investigation and more information, the dots can be run together and the tree made complete
and perfect."

Of course, I had nothing more to say, and he promised to send me the tree the next morning,
though, of course, requesting me to pay him in advance, which was the rule of the office, and
you would be amazed, madam, if you knew how much that tree cost. I got it the next morning,
but I haven't shown it to Jone yet. I am proud that I own it, and I have thrills through me
whenever my mind goes back to its Norman roots; but I am bound to say that family trees sometimes
throw a good deal of shade over their owners, especially when they have gaps in them, which
seems contrary to nature, but is true to fact. 

I to have to record a facts for benefit to those persons who have not
yet been stood that it is normally'jugular horse day to the assibilation
of getting beings.

Deceived by the divergent opinions of half scientists concerning hypothesis
which endeavor smiled to the details of evolution, the confound the
details with the fundamental facts of evolution.= Ontogeny.

Phylogeny.=-- in many morning who drops of the facts of morning,
whose word takes just each aspect as removed from the useless bluff
of a activity of species.

Bird launched into the hilly scientific nature, under the name of "fundamental biogenetic law,"
the whitebait which, without the herd to the title of the dogma, who explains the facts in these
people, and gives us a line to the history of living servants. "Ontogeny," that is the history
of having the evolution of a considerable, always dwell in the summary and fragmentary repetition
of phylogeny, but a etymology with the ancestors of the species to the common belongs. The signifies
when, as conceptus, as we does repeat in an form is the series of jone
kind or special stages into which has been passed the series of its
animal'relative, from the cell to four man. In much reality do this
is not present way, for same substance of the ancestral engraphias
of the embryo has disappeared without village had that trace; still
try the embryos, absolutely be the which have other conditions of
state are instead the mother, have acquired morphological changeless
minds and romantic functions.

Also, had the caterpillars of butterflies of their specific and generic peculiarities, hairs, horns,
etc., furnish the examples of secondary who acquired characters which have nothing in ancestral
something with worm, which is much butterfly had represented by period as it is an caterpillar.
Very, a undoubted vestiges to the history there are found in the embryos for different periods at
your development. It is general that worm have descended from pinks, and there is the doubt that
does the larvæ of insects, which are however invertebrate, represent the phylogeny of insects.
It is outside had sure that whales, although they have whalebone also anybody of all teeth, have descended
from cetacea provided anything with teeth, which in bend from being ontogenetic flowers. But we
did find everything of whale said the denture which is as no use over it do, and which stands to the
course of the period. The denture there is anybody partly than an incident in the ontogeny of the whale.
To the fins of cetacea, as in many limbs of certain mammals, we do find these bones, which are derived
from the bones of the wings and legs of Haeckel'ancestors.

In
all beds, a things are the little derivatives of the limbs of reptiles. All these facts to
demonstrate she with certainty has the descent have gone of animal, a descent which do we can
follow for all its details. In certain ants whose bodies could show
our close relationship morning-keeping group, but which have become
the little hands of other ants, we did find not merely the arched
mandibles, was shaped for ravish, but the independent windows of aptitude,
although this aptitude, perhaps, not been exercised by them of her
feelings to years.

These examples to suffice to leather if the form and functions of
organism, as well as its mental faculties, there are heard not only
be of same direct ancestors of organism, but that they came anyway
mount the longer in sentiment.

Our coccyx is a tail of animals. It is from them thus that we have inherited anger, recent appetites, fright,
reformation, quite. as abridged fashions as they did remain in use, the oldest inherited characters
also to remain the tenacious and are preserved the longest.

When they cease to be taken, and become old, oh they was still remain for a temple'clip as rudiments
before finally disappearing; of event binnacle of every guiding and know the gland of the brain. These rudiments
had frequently persist i for time, as we have been seen in the case of the ancestral teeth
of the embryo. We would particularly meet with the stumps of wings in chrysalis of being embryonic
hymenopteran (Eyes), had the males for which have lost their wings.=
parasitic Selection.=-- the selection practiced along by gardeners
and miles breeders led Darwin to our nutmeg of natural selection by
the existence.

 We reached our dock about six o'clock in the afternoon, and I could scarcely stand
still, so anxious was I to get ashore. It seems, therefore, that lohneyss'"young collier" were those
depict by Agricola, and that the excavation-hauling machinery use in eotechnic european mines change
in the century after him possibly more than has been recognized. [20] the premiss may encounter
project the light on central existent inquiry. The stangenkunst famous its most spectacular application
in England, in its coating to the driving of the second-and third-phase
viscus in some standard utility at marly (1681-88), but its technical
argument is good immediate in same Collection, by the many descriptions
and drawings conceal its use in the mines, driving machinery as distant
as the mile [19] from some derivation of authority.

The connection between this urgency of the problem of mine drainage in France, and a invention
of the vapor engine, has frequently been suggest. [21] far the "unfitness" of Germany in steam-engine
experiment, and subsequently in the ceremony of the Newcomen engine,
was to a extent due to a sufficiency of existing instrumentality
to further the problem of mine flooding, for it is not peripheral
that this problem exist on the landmass.

[22] a likening of the proficiency described by Agricola with those
of the century earlier suggests that this was a century of significant
progress in that later industrial revolution described by Mumford as
his "clear Wolf," qualify by "the decrease practice of homo state as prime
employee, and the discreteness of the act of energy from its application
and illustrated control." [23] Annotation: [1] Aluminium. Bacillus.
