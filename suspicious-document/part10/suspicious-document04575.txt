This promise, in the course of a few days, the Senor says, he faithfully performed, describing
from recollection, by the hand of an amanuensis to whom he dictated, not only the more striking
but even minute and peculiar landmarks for the guidance of the guide. On the 10th of April,
the party, fully recruited in health and energy, set out for Totonicapan; and thence we trace
them by the journal through a succession of small places to Quezaltenango, where they remained
but two days; and thence through the places called Aguas Calientes, and San Sebastiano, to
Gueguetenango; this portion of their route being described as one of unprecedented toil, danger,
and exhaustion, from its mountainous character, accidents to men and mules, terrific weather
and loss of provisions. Arrived, however, at length, at the town last named, which they justly
regarded as an eminently critical stage of their destiny, they found the Cura, and presented
him with the letter of introduction from his friend, the Padre of Quiche. They were somewhat
discouraged on perceiving that the Cura indicated but little confidence in the accuracy of
his old friend's memory, and asked them rather abruptly, if they thought him really serious
in his belief in his distant vision of an unknown city from the sierra, because, for his own
part, he had always regarded the story as one of Padre's broadest jokes, and especially since
he had never heard of any other person possessing equal visual powers. "The mountain was high,
it is true, but not much more than half as high as the hyperbolous memory of his reverend friend
had made it, and he much feared that the Padre, in the course of forty years, had so frequently
repeated a picture of his early imagination as to have, at length, cherished it as a reality."
This was said in smooth and elegant Spanish, but says the Senor, "with an air of dignified
sarcasm upon our credulity, which was far from being agreeable to men broken down and dispirited,
by almost incredible toil, in pursuit of an object thus loftily pronounced a ridiculous phantom
of the brain." This part of Senor Velasquez's journal being interesting and carefully written,
we give the following translation without abridgement:--

     "The Cura, nevertheless, on finding that his supercilious
     scepticism had not proved so infectious among us as he expected and
     that we were rather vexed than vacillating, offered to procure us
     guides in the course of a day or two, who were familiar with many
     parts of the sierra, and who, for good pay, he doubted not, would
     flatter our expectations to the utmost extent we could desire. He
     advised us, however, in the same style of caustic dissuasion, to
     take with us both a barometer and a telescope, if we were provided
     with those instruments, because the latter, especially, might be
     found useful in discovering the unknown city, and the former would
     not only inform us of the height of the mountain, but of the
     weather in prospect most favorable to a distant view. Senor Huertis
     replied that such precautions would be adopted, as a matter of
     course, and would, moreover, furnish him, on our return to
     Gueguetenango, with the exact latitude and longitude of the spot
     from which the discovery might be made. He laughed very heartily
     and rejoined that he thought this operation would be much easier
     than to furnish the same interesting particulars concerning the
     location of the spots at which the discovery might fail to be made;
     and saying this he robed himself for mass, which we all, rather
     sullenly, attended.
