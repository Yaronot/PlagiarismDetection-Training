Chapter 1

Selden paused in surprise. In the afternoon rush of the Grand Central Station his eyes had
been refreshed by the sight of Miss Lily Bart.

It was a Monday in early September, and he was returning to his work from a hurried dip into
the country; but what was Miss Bart doing in town at that season? If she had appeared to be
catching a train, he might have inferred that he had come on her in the act of transition between
one and another of the country-houses which disputed her presence after the close of the Newport
season; but her desultory air perplexed him. She stood apart from the crowd, letting it drift
by her to the platform or the street, and wearing an air of irresolution which might, as he
surmised, be the mask of a very definite purpose. It struck him at once that she was waiting
for some one, but he hardly knew why the idea arrested him. There was nothing new about Lily
Bart, yet he could never see her without a faint movement of interest: it was characteristic
of her that she always roused speculation, that her simplest acts seemed the result of far-reaching
intentions.

An impulse of curiosity made him turn out of his direct line to the door, and stroll past her.
He knew that if she did not wish to be seen she would contrive to elude him; and it amused
him to think of putting her skill to the test.

"Mr. Selden--what good luck!"

She came forward smiling, eager almost, in her resolve to intercept him. One or two persons,
in brushing past them, lingered to look; for Miss Bart was a figure to arrest even the suburban
traveller rushing to his last train.

Selden had never seen her more radiant. Her vivid head, relieved against the dull tints of
the crowd, made her more conspicuous than in a ball-room, and under her dark hat and veil she
regained the girlish smoothness, the purity of tint, that she was beginning to lose after eleven
years of late hours and indefatigable dancing. Was it really eleven years, Selden found himself
wondering, and had she indeed reached the nine-and-twentieth birthday with which her rivals
credited her?

"What luck!" she repeated. "How nice of you to come to my rescue!"

He responded joyfully that to do so was his mission in life, and asked what form the rescue
was to take.

"Oh, almost any--even to sitting on a bench and talking to me.  One sits out a cotillion--why
not sit out a train? It isn't a bit hotter here than in Mrs. Van Osburgh's conservatory--and
some of the women are not a bit uglier."  She broke off, laughing, to explain that she had
come up to town from Tuxedo, on her way to the Gus Trenors' at Bellomont, and had missed the
three-fifteen train to Rhinebeck.  "And there isn't another till half-past five." She consulted
the little jewelled watch among her laces.  "Just two hours to wait. And I don't know what
to do with myself. My maid came up this morning to do some shopping for me, and was to go on
to Bellomont at one o'clock, and my aunt's house is closed, and I don't know a soul in town."
She glanced plaintively about the station. "It IS hotter than Mrs. Van Osburgh's, after all.
If you can spare the time, do take me somewhere for a breath of air."

He declared himself entirely at her disposal: the adventure struck him as diverting. As a spectator,
he had always enjoyed Lily Bart; and his course lay so far out of her orbit that it amused
him to be drawn for a moment into the sudden intimacy which her proposal implied.

"Shall we go over to Sherry's for a cup of tea?"

She smiled assentingly, and then made a slight grimace.

"So many people come up to town on a Monday--one is sure to meet a lot of bores. I'm as old
as the hills, of course, and it ought not to make any difference; but if I'M old enough, you're
not," she objected gaily.  "I'm dying for tea--but isn't there a quieter place?"

He answered her smile, which rested on him vividly. Her discretions interested him almost as
much as her imprudences: he was so sure that both were part of the same carefully-elaborated
plan. In judging Miss Bart, he had always made use of the "argument from design."

"The resources of New York are rather meagre," he said; "but I'll find a hansom first, and
then we'll invent something." He led her through the throng of returning holiday-makers, past
sallow-faced girls in preposterous hats, and flat-chested women struggling with paper bundles
and palm-leaf fans. Was it possible that she belonged to the same race? The dinginess, the
crudity of this average section of womanhood made him feel how highly specialized she was.

A rapid shower had cooled the air, and clouds still hung refreshingly over the moist street.

"How delicious! Let us walk a little," she said as they emerged from the station.

They turned into Madison Avenue and began to stroll northward. As she moved beside him, with
her long light step, Selden was conscious of taking a luxurious pleasure in her nearness: in
the modelling of her little ear, the crisp upward wave of her hair--was it ever so slightly
brightened by art?--and the thick planting of her straight black lashes. Everything about her
was at once vigorous and exquisite, at once strong and fine. He had a confused sense that she
must have cost a great deal to make, that a great many dull and ugly people must, in some mysterious
way, have been sacrificed to produce her. He was aware that the qualities distinguishing her
from the herd of her sex were chiefly external: as though a fine glaze of beauty and fastidiousness
had been applied to vulgar clay. Yet the analogy left him unsatisfied, for a coarse texture
will not take a high finish; and was it not possible that the material was fine, but that circumstance
had fashioned it into a futile shape?

As he reached this point in his speculations the sun came out, and her lifted parasol cut off
his enjoyment. A moment or two later she paused with a sigh.

"Oh, dear, I'm so hot and thirsty--and what a hideous place New York is!" She looked despairingly
up and down the dreary thoroughfare.  "Other cities put on their best clothes in summer, but
New York seems to sit in its shirtsleeves." Her eyes wandered down one of the side-streets.
"Someone has had the humanity to plant a few trees over there. Let us go into the shade."

"I am glad my street meets with your approval," said Selden as they turned the corner.

"Your street? Do you live here?"

She glanced with interest along the new brick and limestone house-fronts, fantastically varied
in obedience to the American craving for novelty, but fresh and inviting with their awnings
and flower-boxes.

"Ah, yes--to be sure: THE BENEDICK. What a nice-looking building!  I don't think I've ever
seen it before." She looked across at the flat-house with its marble porch and pseudo-Georgian
facade.  "Which are your windows? Those with the awnings down?"

"On the top floor--yes."

"And that nice little balcony is yours? How cool it looks up there!"

He paused a moment. "Come up and see," he suggested. "I can give you a cup of tea in no time--and
you won't meet any bores."

Her colour deepened--she still had the art of blushing at the right time--but she took the
suggestion as lightly as it was made.

"Why not? It's too tempting--I'll take the risk," she declared.

"Oh, I'm not dangerous," he said in the same key. In truth, he had never liked her as well
as at that moment. He knew she had accepted without afterthought: he could never be a factor
in her calculations, and there was a surprise, a refreshment almost, in the spontaneity of
her consent.

On the threshold he paused a moment, feeling for his latchkey.

"There's no one here; but I have a servant who is supposed to come in the mornings, and it's
just possible he may have put out the tea-things and provided some cake."

He ushered her into a slip of a hall hung with old prints. She noticed the letters and notes
heaped on the table among his gloves and sticks; then she found herself in a small library,
dark but cheerful, with its walls of books, a pleasantly faded Turkey rug, a littered desk
and, as he had foretold, a tea-tray on a low table near the window. A breeze had sprung up,
swaying inward the muslin curtains, and bringing a fresh scent of mignonette and petunias from
the flower-box on the balcony.

Lily sank with a sigh into one of the shabby leather chairs.

"How delicious to have a place like this all to one's self! What a miserable thing it is to
be a woman." She leaned back in a luxury of discontent.

Selden was rummaging in a cupboard for the cake.

"Even women," he said, "have been known to enjoy the privileges of a flat."

"Oh, governesses--or widows. But not girls--not poor, miserable, marriageable girls!"

"I even know a girl who lives in a flat."

She sat up in surprise. "You do?"

"I do," he assured her, emerging from the cupboard with the sought-for cake.

"Oh, I know--you mean Gerty Farish." She smiled a little unkindly. "But I said MARRIAGEABLE--and
besides, she has a horrid little place, and no maid, and such queer things to eat. Her cook
does the washing and the food tastes of soap. I should hate that, you know."

"You shouldn't dine with her on wash-days," said Selden, cutting the cake.

They both laughed, and he knelt by the table to light the lamp under the kettle, while she
measured out the tea into a little tea-pot of green glaze. As he watched her hand, polished
as a bit of old ivory, with its slender pink nails, and the sapphire bracelet slipping over
her wrist, he was struck with the irony of suggesting to her such a life as his cousin Gertrude
Farish had chosen. She was so evidently the victim of the civilization which had produced her,
that the links of her bracelet seemed like manacles chaining her to her fate.

She seemed to read his thought. "It was horrid of me to say that of Gerty," she said with charming
compunction. "I forgot she was your cousin. But we're so different, you know: she likes being
good, and I like being happy. And besides, she is free and I am not. If I were, I daresay I
could manage to be happy even in her flat. It must be pure bliss to arrange the furniture just
as one likes, and give all the horrors to the ash-man. If I could only do over my aunt's drawing-room
I know I should be a better woman."

"Is it so very bad?" he asked sympathetically.

She smiled at him across the tea-pot which she was holding up to be filled.

"That shows how seldom you come there. Why don't you come oftener?"

"When I do come, it's not to look at Mrs. Peniston's furniture."

"Nonsense," she said. "You don't come at all--and yet we get on so well when we meet."

"Perhaps that's the reason," he answered promptly. "I'm afraid I haven't any cream, you know--shall
you mind a slice of lemon instead?"

"I shall like it better." She waited while he cut the lemon and dropped a thin disk into her
cup. "But that is not the reason," she insisted.

"The reason for what?"

"For your never coming." She leaned forward with a shade of perplexity in her charming eyes.
"I wish I knew--I wish I could make you out. Of course I know there are men who don't like
me--one can tell that at a glance. And there are others who are afraid of me: they think I
want to marry them." She smiled up at him frankly. "But I don't think you dislike me--and you
can't possibly think I want to marry you."

"No--I absolve you of that," he agreed.

"Well, then----?"

He had carried his cup to the fireplace, and stood leaning against the chimney-piece and looking
down on her with an air of indolent amusement. The provocation in her eyes increased his amusement--he
had not supposed she would waste her powder on such small game; but perhaps she was only keeping
her hand in; or perhaps a girl of her type had no conversation but of the personal kind. At
any rate, she was amazingly pretty, and he had asked her to tea and must live up to his obligations.

"Well, then," he said with a plunge, "perhaps THAT'S the reason."

"What?"

"The fact that you don't want to marry me. Perhaps I don't regard it as such a strong inducement
to go and see you." He felt a slight shiver down his spine as he ventured this, but her laugh
reassured him.

"Dear Mr. Selden, that wasn't worthy of you. It's stupid of you to make love to me, and it
isn't like you to be stupid." She leaned back, sipping her tea with an air so enchantingly
judicial that, if they had been in her aunt's drawing-room, he might almost have tried to disprove
her deduction.

"Don't you see," she continued, "that there are men enough to say pleasant things to me, and
that what I want is a friend who won't be afraid to say disagreeable ones when I need them?
Sometimes I have fancied you might be that friend--I don't know why, except that you are neither
a prig nor a bounder, and that I shouldn't have to pretend with you or be on my guard against
you." Her voice had dropped to a note of seriousness, and she sat gazing up at him with the
troubled gravity of a child.

"You don't know how much I need such a friend," she said. "My aunt is full of copy-book axioms,

Lily, with the flavour of Selden's caravan tea on her lips, had no great fancy to drown it
in the railway brew which seemed such nectar to her companion; but, rightly judging that one
of the charms of tea is the fact of drinking it together, she proceeded to give the last touch
to Mr. Gryce's enjoyment by smiling at him across her lifted cup.

"Is it quite right--I haven't made it too strong?" she asked solicitously; and he replied with
conviction that he had never tasted better tea.

"I daresay it is true," she reflected; and her imagination was fired by the thought that Mr.
Gryce, who might have sounded the depths of the most complex self-indulgence, was perhaps actually
taking his first journey alone with a pretty woman.

It struck her as providential that she should be the instrument of his initiation. Some girls
would not have known how to manage him. They would have over-emphasized the novelty of the
adventure, trying to make him feel in it the zest of an escapade.  But Lily's methods were
more delicate. She remembered that her cousin Jack Stepney had once defined Mr. Gryce as the
young man who had promised his mother never to go out in the rain without his overshoes; and
acting on this hint, she resolved to impart a gently domestic air to the scene, in the hope
that her companion, instead of feeling that he was doing something reckless or unusual, would
merely be led to dwell on the advantage of always having a companion to make one's tea in the
train.

But in spite of her efforts, conversation flagged after the tray had been removed, and she
was driven to take a fresh measurement of Mr. Gryce's limitations. It was not, after all, opportunity
but imagination that he lacked: he had a mental palate which would never learn to distinguish
between railway tea and nectar.  There was, however, one topic she could rely on: one spring
that she had only to touch to set his simple machinery in motion. She had refrained from touching
it because it was a last resource, and she had relied on other arts to stimulate other sensations;
but as a settled look of dulness began to creep over his candid features, she saw that extreme
measures were necessary.

"And how," she said, leaning forward, "are you getting on with your Americana?"

His eye became a degree less opaque: it was as though an incipient film had been removed from
it, and she felt the pride of a skilful operator.

"I've got a few new things," he said, suffused with pleasure, but lowering his voice as though
he feared his fellow-passengers might be in league to despoil him.

She returned a sympathetic enquiry, and gradually he was drawn on to talk of his latest purchases.
It was the one subject which enabled him to forget himself, or allowed him, rather, to remember
himself without constraint, because he was at home in it, and could assert a superiority that
there were few to dispute. Hardly any of his acquaintances cared for Americana, or knew anything
about them; and the consciousness of this ignorance threw Mr. Gryce's knowledge into agreeable
relief. The only difficulty was to introduce the topic and to keep it to the front; most people
showed no desire to have their ignorance dispelled, and Mr. Gryce was like a merchant whose
warehouses are crammed with an unmarketable commodity.

But Miss Bart, it appeared, really did want to know about Americana; and moreover, she was
already sufficiently informed to make the task of farther instruction as easy as it was agreeable.
She questioned him intelligently, she heard him submissively; and, prepared for the look of
lassitude which usually crept over his listeners' faces, he grew eloquent under her receptive
gaze.  The "points" she had had the presence of mind to glean from Selden, in anticipation
of this very contingency, were serving her to such good purpose that she began to think her
visit to him had been the luckiest incident of the day. She had once more shown her talent
for profiting by the unexpected, and dangerous theories as to the advisability of yielding
to impulse were germinating under the surface of smiling attention which she continued to present
to her companion.

Mr. Gryce's sensations, if less definite, were equally agreeable.  He felt the confused titillation
with which the lower organisms welcome the gratification of their needs, and all his senses
floundered in a vague well-being, through which Miss Bart's personality was dimly but pleasantly
perceptible.

Mr. Gryce's interest in Americana had not originated with himself: it was impossible to think
of him as evolving any taste of his own. An uncle had left him a collection already noted among
bibliophiles; the existence of the collection was the only fact that had ever shed glory on
the name of Gryce, and the nephew took as much pride in his inheritance as though it had been
his own work. Indeed, he gradually came to regard it as such, and to feel a sense of personal
complacency when he chanced on any reference to the Gryce Americana. Anxious as he was to avoid
personal notice, he took, in the printed mention of his name, a pleasure so exquisite and excessive
that it seemed a compensation for his shrinking from publicity.

To enjoy the sensation as often as possible, he subscribed to all the reviews dealing with
book-collecting in general, and American history in particular, and as allusions to his library
abounded in the pages of these journals, which formed his only reading, he came to regard himself
as figuring prominently in the public eye, and to enjoy the thought of the interest which would
be excited if the persons he met in the street, or sat among in travelling, were suddenly to
be told that he was the possessor of the Gryce Americana.

Most timidities have such secret compensations, and Miss Bart was discerning enough to know
that the inner vanity is generally in proportion to the outer self-depreciation. With a more
confident person she would not have dared to dwell so long on one topic, or to show such exaggerated
interest in it; but she had rightly guessed that Mr. Gryce's egoism was a thirsty soil, requiring
constant nurture from without. Miss Bart had the gift of following an undercurrent of thought
while she appeared to be sailing on the surface of conversation; and in this case her mental
excursion took the form of a rapid survey of Mr. Percy Gryce's future as combined with her
own. The Gryces were from Albany, and but lately introduced to the metropolis, where the mother
and son had come, after old Jefferson Gryce's death, to take possession of his house in Madison
Avenue--an appalling house, all brown stone without and black walnut within, with the Gryce
library in a fire-proof annex that looked like a mausoleum.  Lily, however, knew all about
them: young Mr. Gryce's arrival had fluttered the maternal breasts of New York, and when a
girl has no mother to palpitate for her she must needs be on the alert for herself. Lily, therefore,
had not only contrived to put herself in the young man's way, but had made the acquaintance
of Mrs. Gryce, a monumental woman with the voice of a pulpit orator and a mind preoccupied
with the iniquities of her servants, who came sometimes to sit with Mrs. Peniston and learn
from that lady how she managed to prevent the kitchen-maid's smuggling groceries out of the
house. Mrs. Gryce had a kind of impersonal benevolence: cases of individual need she regarded
with suspicion, but she subscribed to Institutions when their annual reports showed an impressive
surplus. Her domestic duties were manifold, for they extended from furtive inspections of the
servants' bedrooms to unannounced descents to the cellar; but she had never allowed herself
many pleasures. Once, however, she had had a special edition of the Sarum Rule printed in rubric
and presented to every clergyman in the diocese; and the gilt album in which their letters
of thanks were pasted formed the chief ornament of her drawing-room table.

Percy had been brought up in the principles which so excellent a woman was sure to inculcate.
Every form of prudence and suspicion had been grafted on a nature originally reluctant and
cautious, with the result that it would have seemed hardly needful for Mrs. Gryce to extract
his promise about the overshoes, so little likely was he to hazard himself abroad in the rain.
After attaining his majority, and coming into the fortune which the late Mr. Gryce had made
out of a patent device for excluding fresh air from hotels, the young man continued to live
with his mother in Albany; but on Jefferson Gryce's death, when another large property passed
into her son's hands, Mrs. Gryce thought that what she called his "interests" demanded his
presence in New York. She accordingly installed herself in the Madison Avenue house, and Percy,
whose sense of duty was not inferior to his mother's, spent all his week days in the handsome
Broad Street office where a batch of pale men on small salaries had grown grey in the management
of the Gryce estate, and where he was initiated with becoming reverence into every detail of
the art of accumulation.

As far as Lily could learn, this had hitherto been Mr. Gryce's only occupation, and she might
have been pardoned for thinking it not too hard a task to interest a young man who had been
kept on such low diet.  At any rate, she felt herself so completely in command of the situation
that she yielded to a sense of security in which all fear of Mr. Rosedale, and of the difficulties
on which that fear was contingent, vanished beyond the edge of thought.

The stopping of the train at Garrisons would not have distracted her from these thoughts, had
she not caught a sudden look of distress in her companion's eye. His seat faced toward the
door, and she guessed that he had been perturbed by the approach of an acquaintance; a fact
confirmed by the turning of heads and general sense of commotion which her own entrance into
a railway-carriage was apt to produce.

She knew the symptoms at once, and was not surprised to be hailed by the high notes of a pretty
woman, who entered the train accompanied by a maid, a bull-terrier, and a footman staggering
under a load of bags and dressing-cases.

"Oh, Lily--are you going to Bellomont? Then you can't let me have your seat, I suppose? But
I MUST have a seat in this carriage--porter, you must find me a place at once. Can't some one
be put somewhere else? I want to be with my friends. Oh, how do you do, Mr. Gryce? Do please
make him understand that I must have a seat next to you and Lily."

Mrs. George Dorset, regardless of the mild efforts of a traveller with a carpet-bag, who was
doing his best to make room for her by getting out of the train, stood in the middle of the
aisle, diffusing about her that general sense of exasperation which a pretty woman on her travels
not infrequently creates.

She was smaller and thinner than Lily Bart, with a restless pliability of pose, as if she could
have been crumpled up and run through a ring, like the sinuous draperies she affected. Her
small pale face seemed the mere setting of a pair of dark exaggerated eyes, of which the visionary
gaze contrasted curiously with her self-assertive tone and gestures; so that, as one of her
friends observed, she was like a disembodied spirit who took up a great deal of room.

Having finally discovered that the seat adjoining Miss Bart's was at her disposal, she possessed
herself of it with a farther displacement of her surroundings, explaining meanwhile that she
had come across from Mount Kisco in her motor-car that morning, and had been kicking her heels
for an hour at Garrisons, without even the alleviation of a cigarette, her brute of a husband
having neglected to replenish her case before they parted that morning.

"And at this hour of the day I don't suppose you've a single one left, have you, Lily?" she
plaintively concluded.

Miss Bart caught the startled glance of Mr. Percy Gryce, whose own lips were never defiled
by tobacco.

"What an absurd question, Bertha!" she exclaimed, blushing at the thought of the store she
had laid in at Lawrence Selden's.

"Why, don't you smoke? Since when have you given it up? What--you never---- And you don't either,
Mr. Gryce? Ah, of course--how stupid of me--I understand."

And Mrs. Dorset leaned back against her travelling cushions with a smile which made Lily wish
there had been no vacant seat beside her own.

Chapter 3

Bridge at Bellomont usually lasted till the small hours; and when Lily went to bed that night
she had played too long for her own good.

Feeling no desire for the self-communion which awaited her in her room, she lingered on the
broad stairway, looking down into the hall below, where the last card-players were grouped
about the tray of tall glasses and silver-collared decanters which the butler had just placed
on a low table near the fire.

The hall was arcaded, with a gallery supported on columns of pale yellow marble. Tall clumps
of flowering plants were grouped against a background of dark foliage in the angles of the
walls.  On the crimson carpet a deer-hound and two or three spaniels dozed luxuriously before
the fire, and the light from the great central lantern overhead shed a brightness on the women's
hair and struck sparks from their jewels as they moved.

There were moments when such scenes delighted Lily, when they gratified her sense of beauty
and her craving for the external finish of life; there were others when they gave a sharper
edge to the meagreness of her own opportunities. This was one of the moments when the sense
of contrast was uppermost, and she turned away impatiently as Mrs. George Dorset, glittering
in serpentine spangles, drew Percy Gryce in her wake to a confidential nook beneath the gallery.

It was not that Miss Bart was afraid of losing her newly-acquired hold over Mr. Gryce. Mrs.
Dorset might startle or dazzle him, but she had neither the skill nor the patience to effect
his capture.  She was too self-engrossed to penetrate the recesses of his shyness, and besides,
why should she care to give herself the trouble? At most it might amuse her to make sport of
his simplicity for an evening--after that he would be merely a burden to her, and knowing this,
she was far too experienced to encourage him. But the mere thought of that other woman, who
could take a man up and toss him aside as she willed, without having to regard him as a possible
factor in her plans, filled Lily Bart with envy. She had been bored all the afternoon by Percy
Gryce--the mere thought seemed to waken an echo of his droning voice--but she could not ignore
him on the morrow, she must follow up her success, must submit to more boredom, must be ready
with fresh compliances and adaptabilities, and all on the bare chance that he might ultimately
decide to do her the honour of boring her for life.

It was a hateful fate--but how escape from it? What choice had she? To be herself, or a Gerty
Farish. As she entered her bedroom, with its softly-shaded lights, her lace dressing-gown lying
across the silken bedspread, her little embroidered slippers before the fire, a vase of carnations
filling the air with perfume, and the last novels and magazines lying uncut on a table beside
the reading-lamp, she had a vision of Miss Farish's cramped flat, with its cheap conveniences
and hideous wall-papers. No; she was not made for mean and shabby surroundings, for the squalid
compromises of poverty. Her whole being dilated in an atmosphere of luxury; it was the background
she required, the only climate she could breathe in. But the luxury of others was not what
she wanted. A few years ago it had sufficed her: she had taken her daily meed of pleasure without
caring who provided it. Now she was beginning to chafe at the obligations it imposed, to feel
herself a mere pensioner on the splendour which had once seemed to belong to her.  There were
even moments when she was conscious of having to pay her way.

For a long time she had refused to play bridge. She knew she could not afford it, and she was
afraid of acquiring so expensive a taste. She had seen the danger exemplified in more than
one of her associates--in young Ned Silverton, for instance, the charming fair boy now seated
in abject rapture at the elbow of Mrs. Fisher, a striking divorcee with eyes and gowns as emphatic
as the head-lines of her "case." Lily could remember when young Silverton had stumbled into
their circle, with the air of a strayed Arcadian who has published chamung [Updater's note:
charming?] sonnets in his college journal. Since then he had developed a taste for Mrs. Fisher
and bridge, and the latter at least had involved him in expenses from which he had been more
than once rescued by harassed maiden sisters, who treasured the sonnets, and went without sugar
in their tea to keep their darling afloat. Ned's case was familiar to Lily: she had seen his
charming eyes--which had a good deal more poetry in them than the sonnets--change from surprise
to amusement, and from amusement to anxiety, as he passed under the spell of the terrible god
of chance; and she was afraid of discovering the same symptoms in her own case.

For in the last year she had found that her hostesses expected her to take a place at the card-table.
It was one of the taxes she had to pay for their prolonged hospitality, and for the dresses
and trinkets which occasionally replenished her insufficient wardrobe. And since she had played
regularly the passion had grown on her. Once or twice of late she had won a large sum, and
instead of keeping it against future losses, had spent it in dress or jewelry; and the desire
to atone for this imprudence, combined with the increasing exhilaration of the game, drove
her to risk higher stakes at each fresh venture. She tried to excuse herself on the plea that,
in the Trenor set, if one played at all one must either play high or be set down as priggish
or stingy; but she knew that the gambling passion was upon her, and that in her present surroundings
there was small hope of resisting it.

Tonight the luck had been persistently bad, and the little gold purse which hung among her
trinkets was almost empty when she returned to her room. She unlocked the wardrobe, and taking
out her jewel-case, looked under the tray for the roll of bills from which she had replenished
the purse before going down to dinner.  Only twenty dollars were left: the discovery was so
startling that for a moment she fancied she must have been robbed. Then she took paper and
pencil, and seating herself at the writing-table, tried to reckon up what she had spent during
the day.  Her head was throbbing with fatigue, and she had to go over the figures again and
again; but at last it became clear to her that she had lost three hundred dollars at cards.
She took out her cheque-book to see if her balance was larger than she remembered, but found
she had erred in the other direction. Then she returned to her calculations; but figure as
she would, she could not conjure back the vanished three hundred dollars. It was the sum she
had set aside to pacify her dress-maker--unless she should decide to use it as a sop to the
jeweller. At any rate, she had so many uses for it that its very insufficiency had caused her
to play high in the hope of doubling it.  But of course she had lost--she who needed every
penny, while Bertha Dorset, whose husband showered money on her, must have pocketed at least
five hundred, and Judy Trenor, who could have afforded to lose a thousand a night, had left
the table clutching such a heap of bills that she had been unable to shake hands with her guests
when they bade her good night.

A world in which such things could be seemed a miserable place to Lily Bart; but then she had
never been able to understand the laws of a universe which was so ready to leave her out of
its calculations.

She began to undress without ringing for her maid, whom she had sent to bed. She had been long
enough in bondage to other people's pleasure to be considerate of those who depended on hers,
and in her bitter moods it sometimes struck her that she and her maid were in the same position,
except that the latter received her wages more regularly.

As she sat before the mirror brushing her hair, her face looked hollow and pale, and she was
frightened by two little lines near her mouth, faint flaws in the smooth curve of the cheek.

"Oh, I must stop worrying!" she exclaimed. "Unless it's the electric light----" she reflected,
springing up from her seat and lighting the candles on the dressing-table.

She turned out the wall-lights, and peered at herself between the candle-flames. The white
oval of her face swam out waveringly from a background of shadows, the uncertain light blurring
it like a haze; but the two lines about the mouth remained.

Lily rose and undressed in haste.

"It is only because I am tired and have such odious things to think about," she kept repeating;
and it seemed an added injustice that petty cares should leave a trace on the beauty which
was her only defence against them.

But the odious things were there, and remained with her. She returned wearily to the thought
of Percy Gryce, as a wayfarer picks up a heavy load and toils on after a brief rest. She was
almost sure she had "landed" him: a few days' work and she would win her reward. But the reward
itself seemed unpalatable just then: she could get no zest from the thought of victory. It
would be a rest from worry, no more--and how little that would have seemed to her a few years
earlier! Her ambitions had shrunk gradually in the desiccating air of failure. But why had
she failed? Was it her own fault or that of destiny?

She remembered how her mother, after they had lost their money, used to say to her with a kind
of fierce vindictiveness: "But you'll get it all back--you'll get it all back, with your face."
. . . The remembrance roused a whole train of association, and she lay in the darkness reconstructing
the past out of which her present had grown.

A house in which no one ever dined at home unless there was "company"; a door-bell perpetually
ringing; a hall-table showered with square envelopes which were opened in haste, and oblong
envelopes which were allowed to gather dust in the depths of a bronze jar; a series of French
and English maids giving warning amid a chaos of hurriedly-ransacked wardrobes and dress-closets;
an equally changing dynasty of nurses and footmen; quarrels in the pantry, the kitchen and
the drawing-room; precipitate trips to Europe, and returns with gorged trunks and days of interminable
unpacking; semi-annual discussions as to where the summer should be spent, grey interludes
of economy and brilliant reactions of expense--such was the setting of Lily Bart's first memories.

Ruling the turbulent element called home was the vigorous and determined figure of a mother
still young enough to dance her ball-dresses to rags, while the hazy outline of a neutral-tinted
father filled an intermediate space between the butler and the man who came to wind the clocks.
Even to the eyes of infancy, Mrs. Hudson Bart had appeared young; but Lily could not recall
the time when her father had not been bald and slightly stooping, with streaks of grey in his
hair, and a tired walk. It was a shock to her to learn afterward that he was but two years
older than her mother.

Lily seldom saw her father by daylight. All day he was "down town"; and in winter it was long
after nightfall when she heard his fagged step on the stairs and his hand on the school-room
door. He would kiss her in silence, and ask one or two questions of the nurse or the governess;
then Mrs. Bart's maid would come to remind him that he was dining out, and he would hurry away
with a nod to Lily. In summer, when he joined them for a Sunday at Newport or Southampton,
he was even more effaced and silent than in winter. It seemed to tire him to rest, and he would
sit for hours staring at the sea-line from a quiet corner of the verandah, while the clatter
of his wife's existence went on unheeded a few feet off. Generally, however, Mrs. Bart and
Lily went to Europe for the summer, and before the steamer was half way over Mr. Bart had dipped
below the horizon. Sometimes his daughter heard him denounced for having neglected to forward
Mrs. Bart's remittances; but for the most part he was never mentioned or thought of till his
patient stooping figure presented itself on the New York dock as a buffer between the magnitude
of his wife's luggage and the restrictions of the American custom-house.

In this desultory yet agitated fashion life went on through Lily's teens: a zig-zag broken
course down which the family craft glided on a rapid current of amusement, tugged at by the
underflow of a perpetual need--the need of more money. Lily could not recall the time when
there had been money enough, and in some vague way her father seemed always to blame for the
deficiency.  It could certainly not be the fault of Mrs. Bart, who was spoken of by her friends
as a "wonderful manager." Mrs. Bart was famous for the unlimited effect she produced on limited
means; and to the lady and her acquaintances there was something heroic in living as though
one were much richer than one's bank-book denoted.

Lily was naturally proud of her mother's aptitude in this line: she had been brought up in
the faith that, whatever it cost, one must have a good cook, and be what Mrs. Bart called "decently
dressed." Mrs. Bart's worst reproach to her husband was to ask him if he expected her to "live
like a pig"; and his replying in the negative was always regarded as a justification for cabling
to Paris for an extra dress or two, and telephoning to the jeweller that he might, after all,
send home the turquoise bracelet which Mrs. Bart had looked at that morning.

Lily knew people who "lived like pigs," and their appearance and surroundings justified her
mother's repugnance to that form of existence. They were mostly cousins, who inhabited dingy
houses with engravings from Cole's Voyage of Life on the drawing-room walls, and slatternly
parlour-maids who said "I'll go and see" to visitors calling at an hour when all right-minded
persons are conventionally if not actually out. The disgusting part of it was that many of
these cousins were rich, so that Lily imbibed the idea that if people lived like pigs it was
from choice, and through the lack of any proper standard of conduct.  This gave her a sense
of reflected superiority, and she did not need Mrs. Bart's comments on the family frumps and
misers to foster her naturally lively taste for splendour.

Lily was nineteen when circumstances caused her to revise her view of the universe.

The previous year she had made a dazzling debut fringed by a heavy thunder-cloud of bills.
The light of the debut still lingered on the horizon, but the cloud had thickened; and suddenly
it broke. The suddenness added to the horror; and there were still times when Lily relived
with painful vividness every detail of the day on which the blow fell. She and her mother had
been seated at the luncheon-table, over the CHAUFROIX and cold salmon of the previous night's
dinner: it was one of Mrs. Bart's few economies to consume in private the expensive remnants
of her hospitality. Lily was feeling the pleasant languor which is youth's penalty for dancing
till dawn; but her mother, in spite of a few lines about the mouth, and under the yellow waves
on her temples, was as alert, determined and high in colour as if she had risen from an untroubled
sleep.

In the centre of the table, between the melting MARRONS GLACES and candied cherries, a pyramid
of American Beauties lifted their vigorous stems; they held their heads as high as Mrs. Bart,
but their rose-colour had turned to a dissipated purple, and Lily's sense of fitness was disturbed
by their reappearance on the luncheon-table.

"I really think, mother," she said reproachfully, "we might afford a few fresh flowers for
luncheon. Just some jonquils or lilies-of-the-valley--"

Mrs. Bart stared. Her own fastidiousness had its eye fixed on the world, and she did not care
how the luncheon-table looked when there was no one present at it but the family. But she smiled
at her daughter's innocence.

"Lilies-of-the-valley," she said calmly, "cost two dollars a dozen at this season."

Lily was not impressed. She knew very little of the value of money.

"It would not take more than six dozen to fill that bowl," she argued.

"Six dozen what?" asked her father's voice in the doorway.

The two women looked up in surprise; though it was a Saturday, the sight of Mr. Bart at luncheon
was an unwonted one. But neither his wife nor his daughter was sufficiently interested to ask
an explanation.

Mr. Bart dropped into a chair, and sat gazing absently at the fragment of jellied salmon which
the butler had placed before him.

"I was only saying," Lily began, "that I hate to see faded flowers at luncheon; and mother
says a bunch of lilies-of-the-valley would not cost more than twelve dollars. Mayn't I tell
the florist to send a few every day?"

She leaned confidently toward her father: he seldom refused her anything, and Mrs. Bart had
taught her to plead with him when her own entreaties failed.

Mr. Bart sat motionless, his gaze still fixed on the salmon, and his lower jaw dropped; he
looked even paler than usual, and his thin hair lay in untidy streaks on his forehead. Suddenly
he looked at his daughter and laughed. The laugh was so strange that Lily coloured under it:
she disliked being ridiculed, and her father seemed to see something ridiculous in the request.
Perhaps he thought it foolish that she should trouble him about such a trifle.

"Twelve dollars--twelve dollars a day for flowers? Oh, certainly, my dear--give him an order
for twelve hundred." He continued to laugh.

Mrs. Bart gave him a quick glance.

"You needn't wait, Poleworth--I will ring for you," she said to the butler.

The butler withdrew with an air of silent disapproval, leaving the remains of the CHAUFROIX
on the sideboard.

"What is the matter, Hudson? Are you ill?" said Mrs. Bart severely.

She had no tolerance for scenes which were not of her own making, and it was odious to her
that her husband should make a show of himself before the servants.

"Are you ill?" she repeated.

"Ill?---- No, I'm ruined," he said.

Lily made a frightened sound, and Mrs. Bart rose to her feet.

"Ruined----?" she cried; but controlling herself instantly, she turned a calm face to Lily.

"Shut the pantry door," she said.

Lily obeyed, and when she turned back into the room her father was sitting with both elbows
on the table, the plate of salmon between them, and his head bowed on his hands.

Mrs. Bart stood over him with a white face which made her hair unnaturally yellow. She looked
at Lily as the latter approached: her look was terrible, but her voice was modulated to a ghastly
cheerfulness.

"Your father is not well--he doesn't know what he is saying. It is nothing--but you had better
go upstairs; and don't talk to the servants," she added.

Lily obeyed; she always obeyed when her mother spoke in that voice. She had not been deceived
by Mrs. Bart's words: she knew at once that they were ruined. In the dark hours which followed,
that awful fact overshadowed even her father's slow and difficult dying. To his wife he no
longer counted: he had become extinct when he ceased to fulfil his purpose, and she sat at
his side with the provisional air of a traveller who waits for a belated train to start. Lily's
feelings were softer: she pitied him in a frightened ineffectual way. But the fact that he
was for the most part unconscious, and that his attention, when she stole into the room, drifted
away from her after a moment, made him even more of a stranger than in the nursery days when
he had never come home till after dark. She seemed always to have seen him through a blur--first
of sleepiness, then of distance and indifference--and now the fog had thickened till he was
almost indistinguishable. If she could have performed any little services for him, or have
exchanged with him a few of those affecting words which an extensive perusal of fiction had
led her to connect with such occasions, the filial instinct might have stirred in her; but
her pity, finding no active expression, remained in a state of spectatorship, overshadowed
by her mother's grim unflagging resentment. Every look and act of Mrs. Bart's seemed to say:
"You are sorry for him now--but you will feel differently when you see what he has done to us."

It was a relief to Lily when her father died.

Then a long winter set in. There was a little money left, but to Mrs. Bart it seemed worse
than nothing--the mere mockery of what she was entitled to. What was the use of living if one
had to live like a pig? She sank into a kind of furious apathy, a state of inert anger against
fate. Her faculty for "managing" deserted her, or she no longer took sufficient pride in it
to exert it. It was well enough to "manage" when by so doing one could keep one's own carriage;
but when one's best contrivance did not conceal the fact that one had to go on foot, the effort
was no longer worth making.

Lily and her mother wandered from place to place, now paying long visits to relations whose
house-keeping Mrs. Bart criticized, and who deplored the fact that she let Lily breakfast in
bed when the girl had no prospects before her, and now vegetating in cheap continental refuges,
where Mrs. Bart held herself fiercely aloof from the frugal tea-tables of her companions in
misfortune. She was especially careful to avoid her old friends and the scenes of her former
successes. To be poor seemed to her such a confession of failure that it amounted to disgrace;
and she detected a note of condescension in the friendliest advances.

Only one thought consoled her, and that was the contemplation of Lily's beauty. She studied
it with a kind of passion, as though it were some weapon she had slowly fashioned for her vengeance.
It was the last asset in their fortunes, the nucleus around which their life was to be rebuilt.
She watched it jealously, as though it were her own property and Lily its mere custodian; and
she tried to instil into the latter a sense of the responsibility that such a charge involved.
She followed in imagination the career of other beauties, pointing out to her daughter what
might be achieved through such a gift, and dwelling on the awful warning of those who, in spite
of it, had failed to get what they wanted: to Mrs. Bart, only stupidity could explain the lamentable
denouement of some of her examples. She was not above the inconsistency of charging fate, rather
than herself, with her own misfortunes; but she inveighed so acrimoniously against love-matches
that Lily would have fancied her own marriage had been of that nature, had not Mrs. Bart frequently
assured her that she had been "talked into it"--by whom, she never made clear.

Lily was duly impressed by the magnitude of her opportunities.  The dinginess of her present
life threw into enchanting relief the existence to which she felt herself entitled. To a less
illuminated intelligence Mrs. Bart's counsels might have been dangerous; but Lily understood
that beauty is only the raw material of conquest, and that to convert it into success other
arts are required. She knew that to betray any sense of superiority was a subtler form of the
stupidity her mother denounced, and it did not take her long to learn that a beauty needs more
tact than the possessor of an average set of features.

Her ambitions were not as crude as Mrs. Bart's. It had been among that lady's grievances that
her husband--in the early days, before he was too tired--had wasted his evenings in what she
vaguely described as "reading poetry"; and among the effects packed off to auction after his
death were a score or two of dingy volumes which had struggled for existence among the boots
and medicine bottles of his dressing-room shelves. There was in Lily a vein of sentiment, perhaps
transmitted from this source, which gave an idealizing touch to her most prosaic purposes.
She liked to think of her beauty as a power for good, as giving her the opportunity to attain
a position where she should make her influence felt in the vague diffusion of refinement and
good taste.  She was fond of pictures and flowers, and of sentimental fiction, and she could
not help thinking that the possession of such tastes ennobled her desire for worldly advantages.
She would not indeed have cared to marry a man who was merely rich: she was secretly ashamed
of her mother's crude passion for money.  Lily's preference would have been for an English
nobleman with political ambitions and vast estates; or, for second choice, an Italian prince
with a castle in the Apennines and an hereditary office in the Vatican. Lost causes had a romantic
charm for her, and she liked to picture herself as standing aloof from the vulgar press of
the Quirinal, and sacrificing her pleasure to the claims of an immemorial tradition. . . .

How long ago and how far off it all seemed! Those ambitions were hardly more futile and childish
than the earlier ones which had centred about the possession of a French jointed doll with
real hair. Was it only ten years since she had wavered in imagination between the English earl
and the Italian prince? Relentlessly her mind travelled on over the dreary interval. . . .

After two years of hungry roaming Mrs. Bart had died----died of a deep disgust. She had hated
dinginess, and it was her fate to be dingy. Her visions of a brilliant marriage for Lily had
faded after the first year.

"People can't marry you if they don't see you--and how can they see you in these holes where
we're stuck?" That was the burden of her lament; and her last adjuration to her daughter was
to escape from dinginess if she could.

"Don't let it creep up on you and drag you down. Fight your way out of it somehow--you're young
and can do it," she insisted.

She had died during one of their brief visits to New York, and there Lily at once became the
centre of a family council composed of the wealthy relatives whom she had been taught to despise
for living like pigs. It may be that they had an inkling of the sentiments in which she had
been brought up, for none of them manifested a very lively desire for her company; indeed,
the question threatened to remain unsolved till Mrs. Peniston with a sigh announced: "I'll
try her for a year."

Every one was surprised, but one and all concealed their surprise, lest Mrs. Peniston should
be alarmed by it into reconsidering her decision.

Mrs. Peniston was Mr. Bart's widowed sister, and if she was by no means the richest of the
family group, its other members nevertheless abounded in reasons why she was clearly destined
by Providence to assume the charge of Lily. In the first place she was alone, and it would
be charming for her to have a young companion. Then she sometimes travelled, and Lily's familiarity
with foreign customs--deplored as a misfortune by her more conservative relatives--would at
least enable her to act as a kind of courier. But as a matter of fact Mrs. Peniston had not
been affected by these considerations. She had taken the girl simply because no one else would
have her, and because she had the kind of moral MAUVAISE HONTE which makes the public display
of selfishness difficult, though it does not interfere with its private indulgence. It would
have been impossible for Mrs. Peniston to be heroic on a desert island, but with the eyes of
her little world upon her she took a certain pleasure in her act.

She reaped the reward to which disinterestedness is entitled, and found an agreeable companion
in her niece. She had expected to find Lily headstrong, critical and "foreign"--for even Mrs.
Peniston, though she occasionally went abroad, had the family dread of foreignness--but the
girl showed a pliancy, which, to a more penetrating mind than her aunt's, might have been less
reassuring than the open selfishness of youth. Misfortune had made Lily supple instead of hardening
her, and a pliable substance is less easy to break than a stiff one.

Mrs. Peniston, however, did not suffer from her niece's adaptability. Lily had no intention
of taking advantage of her aunt's good nature.  She was in truth grateful for the refuge offered
her: Mrs. Peniston's opulent interior was at least not externally dingy. But dinginess is a
quality which assumes all manner of disguises; and Lily soon found that it was as latent in
the expensive routine of her aunt's life as in the makeshift existence of a continental pension.

Mrs. Peniston was one of the episodical persons who form the padding of life. It was impossible
to believe that she had herself ever been a focus of activities. The most vivid thing about
her was the fact that her grandmother had been a Van Alstyne. This connection with the well-fed
and industrious stock of early New York revealed itself in the glacial neatness of Mrs. Peniston's
drawing-room and in the excellence of her cuisine. She belonged to the class of old New Yorkers
who have always lived well, dressed expensively, and done little else; and to these inherited
obligations Mrs. Peniston faithfully conformed.  She had always been a looker-on at life, and
her mind resembled one of those little mirrors which her Dutch ancestors were accustomed to
affix to their upper windows, so that from the depths of an impenetrable domesticity they might
see what was happening in the street.

Mrs. Peniston was the owner of a country-place in New Jersey, but she had never lived there
since her husband's death--a remote event, which appeared to dwell in her memory chiefly as
a dividing point in the personal reminiscences that formed the staple of her conversation.
She was a woman who remembered dates with intensity, and could tell at a moment's notice whether
the drawing-room curtains had been renewed before or after Mr. Peniston's last illness.

Mrs. Peniston thought the country lonely and trees damp, and cherished a vague fear of meeting
a bull. To guard against such contingencies she frequented the more populous watering-places,
where she installed herself impersonally in a hired house and looked on at life through the
matting screen of her verandah. In the care of such a guardian, it soon became clear to Lily
that she was to enjoy only the material advantages of good food and expensive clothing; and,
though far from underrating these, she would gladly have exchanged them for what Mrs. Bart
had taught her to regard as opportunities. She sighed to think what her mother's fierce energies
would have accomplished, had they been coupled with Mrs. Peniston's resources. Lily had abundant
energy of her own, but it was restricted by the necessity of adapting herself to her aunt's
habits. She saw that at all costs she must keep Mrs. Peniston's favour till, as Mrs. Bart would
have phrased it, she could stand on her own legs. Lily had no mind for the vagabond life of
the poor relation, and to adapt herself to Mrs. Peniston she had, to some degree, to assume
that lady's passive attitude. She had fancied at first that it would be easy to draw her aunt
into the whirl of her own activities, but there was a static force in Mrs. Peniston against
which her niece's efforts spent themselves in vain. To attempt to bring her into active relation
with life was like tugging at a piece of furniture which has been screwed to the floor. She
did not, indeed, expect Lily to remain equally immovable: she had all the American guardian's
indulgence for the volatility of youth.

She had indulgence also for certain other habits of her niece's.  It seemed to her natural
that Lily should spend all her money on dress, and she supplemented the girl's scanty income
by occasional "handsome presents" meant to be applied to the same purpose. Lily, who was intensely
practical, would have preferred a fixed allowance; but Mrs. Peniston liked the periodical recurrence
of gratitude evoked by unexpected cheques, and was perhaps shrewd enough to perceive that such
a method of giving kept alive in her niece a salutary sense of dependence.

Beyond this, Mrs. Peniston had not felt called upon to do anything for her charge: she had
simply stood aside and let her take the field. Lily had taken it, at first with the confidence
of assured possessorship, then with gradually narrowing demands, till now she found herself
actually struggling for a foothold on the broad space which had once seemed her own for the
asking. How it happened she did not yet know.  Sometimes she thought it was because Mrs. Peniston
had been too passive, and again she feared it was because she herself had not been passive
enough. Had she shown an undue eagerness for victory? Had she lacked patience, pliancy and
dissimulation? Whether she charged herself with these faults or absolved herself from them,
made no difference in the sum-total of her failure. Younger and plainer girls had been married
off by dozens, and she was nine-and-twenty, and still Miss Bart.

She was beginning to have fits of angry rebellion against fate, when she longed to drop out
of the race and make an independent life for herself. But what manner of life would it be?
She had barely enough money to pay her dress-makers' bills and her gambling debts; and none
of the desultory interests which she dignified with the name of tastes was pronounced enough
to enable her to live contentedly in obscurity.  Ah, no--she was too intelligent not to be
honest with herself. She knew that she hated dinginess as much as her mother had hated it,
and to her last breath she meant to fight against it, dragging herself up again and again above
its flood till she gained the bright pinnacles of success which presented such a slippery surface
to her clutch.

Chapter 4

The next morning, on her breakfast tray, Miss Bart found a note from her hostess.

"Dearest Lily," it ran, "if it is not too much of a bore to be down by ten, will you come to
my sitting-room to help me with some tiresome things?"

Lily tossed aside the note and subsided on her pillows with a sigh. It WAS a bore to be down
by ten--an hour regarded at Bellomont as vaguely synchronous with sunrise--and she knew too
well the nature of the tiresome things in question. Miss Pragg, the secretary, had been called
away, and there would be notes and dinner-cards to write, lost addresses to hunt up, and other
social drudgery to perform. It was understood that Miss Bart should fill the gap in such emergencies,
and she usually recognized the obligation without a murmur.

Today, however, it renewed the sense of servitude which the previous night's review of her
cheque-book had produced.  Everything in her surroundings ministered to feelings of ease and
amenity. The windows stood open to the sparkling freshness of the September morning, and between
the yellow boughs she caught a perspective of hedges and parterres leading by degrees of lessening
formality to the free undulations of the park. Her maid had kindled a little fire on the hearth,
and it contended cheerfully with the sunlight which slanted across the moss-green carpet and
caressed the curved sides of an old marquetry desk.  Near the bed stood a table holding her
breakfast tray, with its harmonious porcelain and silver, a handful of violets in a slender
glass, and the morning paper folded beneath her letters.  There was nothing new to Lily in
these tokens of a studied luxury; but, though they formed a part of her atmosphere, she never
lost her sensitiveness to their charm. Mere display left her with a sense of superior distinction;
but she felt an affinity to all the subtler manifestations of wealth.

Mrs. Trenor's summons, however, suddenly recalled her state of dependence, and she rose and
dressed in a mood of irritability that she was usually too prudent to indulge. She knew that
such emotions leave lines on the face as well as in the character, and she had meant to take
warning by the little creases which her midnight survey had revealed.

The matter-of-course tone of Mrs. Trenor's greeting deepened her irritation. If one did drag
one's self out of bed at such an hour, and come down fresh and radiant to the monotony of note-writing,
some special recognition of the sacrifice seemed fitting. But Mrs. Trenor's tone showed no
consciousness of the fact.

"Oh, Lily, that's nice of you," she merely sighed across the chaos of letters, bills and other
domestic documents which gave an incongruously commercial touch to the slender elegance of
her writing-table.

"There are such lots of horrors this morning," she added, clearing a space in the centre of
the confusion and rising to yield her seat to Miss Bart.

Mrs. Trenor was a tall fair woman, whose height just saved her from redundancy. Her rosy blondness
had survived some forty years of futile activity without showing much trace of ill-usage except
in a diminished play of feature. It was difficult to define her beyond saying that she seemed
to exist only as a hostess, not so much from any exaggerated instinct of hospitality as because
she could not sustain life except in a crowd. The collective nature of her interests exempted
her from the ordinary rivalries of her sex, and she knew no more personal emotion than that
of hatred for the woman who presumed to give bigger dinners or have more amusing house-parties
than herself. As her social talents, backed by Mr. Trenor's bank-account, almost always assured
her ultimate triumph in such competitions, success had developed in her an unscrupulous good
nature toward the rest of her sex, and in Miss Bart's utilitarian classification of her friends,
Mrs. Trenor ranked as the woman who was least likely to "go back" on her.

"It was simply inhuman of Pragg to go off now," Mrs. Trenor declared, as her friend seated
herself at the desk. "She says her sister is going to have a baby--as if that were anything
to having a house-party! I'm sure I shall get most horribly mixed up and there will be some
awful rows. When I was down at Tuxedo I asked a lot of people for next week, and I've mislaid
the list and can't remember who is coming. And this week is going to be a horrid failure too--and
Gwen Van Osburgh will go back and tell her mother how bored people were. I did mean to ask
the Wetheralls--that was a blunder of Gus's. They disapprove of Carry Fisher, you know. As
if one could help having Carry Fisher! It WAS foolish of her to get that second divorce--Carry
always overdoes things--but she said the only way to get a penny out of Fisher was to divorce
him and make him pay alimony. And poor Carry has to consider every dollar. It's really absurd
of Alice Wetherall to make such a fuss about meeting her, when one thinks of what society is
coming to. Some one said the other day that there was a divorce and a case of appendicitis
in every family one knows. Besides, Carry is the only person who can keep Gus in a good humour
when we have bores in the house. Have you noticed that ALL the husbands like her? All, I mean,
except her own. It's rather clever of her to have made a specialty of devoting herself to dull
people--the field is such a large one, and she has it practically to herself. She finds compensations,
no doubt--I know she borrows money of Gus--but then I'd PAY her to keep him in a good humour,
so I can't complain, after all."

Mrs. Trenor paused to enjoy the spectacle of Miss Bart's efforts to unravel her tangled correspondence.

"But it is only the Wetheralls and Carry," she resumed, with a fresh note of lament. "The truth
is, I'm awfully disappointed in Lady Cressida Raith."

"Disappointed? Had you known her before?"

"Mercy, no--never saw her till yesterday. Lady Skiddaw sent her over with letters to the Van
Osburghs, and I heard that Maria Van Osburgh was asking a big party to meet her this week,
so I thought it would be fun to get her away, and Jack Stepney, who knew her in India, managed
it for me. Maria was furious, and actually had the impudence to make Gwen invite herself here,
so that they shouldn't be QUITE out of it--if I'd known what Lady Cressida was like, they could
have had her and welcome! But I thought any friend of the Skiddaws' was sure to be amusing.
You remember what fun Lady Skiddaw was? There were times when I simply had to send the girls
out of the room. Besides, Lady Cressida is the Duchess of Beltshire's sister, and I naturally
supposed she was the same sort; but you never can tell in those English families. They are
so big that there's room for all kinds, and it turns out that Lady Cressida is the moral one--married
a clergy-man and does missionary work in the East End. Think of my taking such a lot of trouble
about a clergyman's wife, who wears Indian jewelry and botanizes! She made Gus take her all
through the glass-houses yesterday, and bothered him to death by asking him the names of the
plants. Fancy treating Gus as if he were the gardener!"

Mrs. Trenor brought this out in a CRESCENDO of indignation.

"Oh, well, perhaps Lady Cressida will reconcile the Wetheralls to meeting Carry Fisher," said
Miss Bart pacifically.

"I'm sure I hope so! But she is boring all the men horribly, and if she takes to distributing
tracts, as I hear she does, it will be too depressing. The worst of it is that she would have
been so useful at the right time. You know we have to have the Bishop once a year, and she
would have given just the right tone to things. I always have horrid luck about the Bishop's
visits," added Mrs. Trenor, whose present misery was being fed by a rapidly rising tide of
reminiscence; "last year, when he came, Gus forgot all about his being here, and brought home
the Ned Wintons and the Farleys--five divorces and six sets of children between them!"

"When is Lady Cressida going?" Lily enquired.

Mrs. Trenor cast up her eyes in despair. "My dear, if one only knew! I was in such a hurry
to get her away from Maria that I actually forgot to name a date, and Gus says she told some
one she meant to stop here all winter."

"To stop here? In this house?"

"Don't be silly--in America. But if no one else asks her--you know they NEVER go to hotels."

"Perhaps Gus only said it to frighten you."

"No--I heard her tell Bertha Dorset that she had six months to put in while her husband was
taking the cure in the Engadine. You should have seen Bertha look vacant! "they haven't got the
time," few replied, "because the session on March 4th at noon, over about twenty-four hours before
Admiral Grayson is give his first professional call to President Wilson aboard
a George Washington, and by a Congress gets just so President Wilson
comes to a League of Nations suggestion stitch up just so that there
will be nothing left for them Senators to do but to-- indorse you."
"but, as i understand it, them Senators however loafed away their
time during a terminal of the session and didn't pass has a lot of
laws what they should ought to have passed, the, together that it
will be necessary for President Wilson to the session in the years,"
Morris said.

"that'mho what them Senators are calculate," Abe has mistaken, "but they was agreed, mawruss, because
the President ain't making to shake the chances of being interrupted
while he is working on an Peace as Conference by S O S broadcast
from Washington to please arrive home if he wants to a prevention
anything out of this Congress is going of the hearer of the Capitol."

"but i thought that before he threw on Europe in the first grave, Abe, President Wilson said
to Congress that it wouldn't make that difference to them about his
being in Europe, because he was in again touch with them, and that
the cablegram but abe wireless would make him available lately as
though he was yet living in a House," Morris state.

"sure, i know," Abe agreed; "but the t vengeance with that situation
was that engineering'ain't been seen by the inventors hitherto how abe
President would idle hands with the Senator by wireless or how he can
sit down to dinner by wireless with a few Congressmen and make them
did feel that he is their one best friend.

Just, mawruss, it expects low never for being such President to find cable messages to the Senator
which he believe is getting sore about something, a cable messages being in the nature of:'hello,
Henry, what's that anagram? Why is it i'ain't discovered you up to such white House here, Henry?'or,'whether
have you been keeping yourself lately, Henry?'or,'Mrs. Lodge and
the children all right, Henry?'or something like a."

In fact, from what i have seen of Mr. Wilson, he appear to me like any male
who there can send it the lot easier to be easy in his manner toward
Congressmen by wireless or by cable than face to face. "" say, for what
any matter, Abe, "Morris observed," President Wilson close did a
fractional lot of jollying when he could have done it fast the telephony
at unlimited local-service rates.



"Oh, I am--it's much safer to be fond of dangerous people. But she IS dangerous--and if I ever
saw her up to mischief it's now.  I can tell by poor George's manner. That man is a perfect
barometer--he always knows when Bertha is going to----"

"To fall?" Miss Bart suggested.

"Don't be shocking! You know he believes in her still. And of course I don't say there's any
real harm in Bertha. Only she delights in making people miserable, and especially poor George."

"Well, he seems cut out for the part--I don't wonder she likes more cheerful companionship."

"Oh, George is not as dismal as you think. If Bertha did worry him he would be quite different.
Or if she'd leave him alone, and let him arrange his life as he pleases. But she doesn't dare
lose her hold of him on account of the money, and so when HE isn't jealous she pretends to be."

Miss Bart went on writing in silence, and her hostess sat following her train of thought with
frowning intensity.

"Do you know," she exclaimed after a long pause, "I believe I'll call up Lawrence on the telephone
and tell him he simply MUST come?"

"Oh, don't," said Lily, with a quick suffusion of colour. The blush surprised her almost as
much as it did her hostess, who, though not commonly observant of facial changes, sat staring
at her with puzzled eyes.

"Good gracious, Lily, how handsome you are! Why? Do you dislike him so much?"

"Not at all; I like him. But if you are actuated by the benevolent intention of protecting
me from Bertha--I don't think I need your protection."

Mrs. Trenor sat up with an exclamation. "Lily!----PERCY? Do you mean to say you've actually
done it?"

Miss Bart smiled. "I only mean to say that Mr. Gryce and I are getting to be very good friends."

"H'm--I see." Mrs. Trenor fixed a rapt eye upon her. "You know they say he has eight hundred
thousand a year--and spends nothing, except on some rubbishy old books. And his mother has
heart-disease and will leave him a lot more. OH, LILY, DO GO SLOWLY," her friend adjured her.

Miss Bart continued to smile without annoyance. "I shouldn't, for instance," she remarked,
"be in any haste to tell him that he had a lot of rubbishy old books."

"No, of course not; I know you're wonderful about getting up people's subjects. But he's horribly
shy, and easily shocked, and--and----"

"Why don't you say it, Judy? I have the reputation of being on the hunt for a rich husband?"

"Oh, I don't mean that; he wouldn't believe it of you--at first," said Mrs. Trenor, with candid
shrewdness. "But you know things are rather lively here at times--I must give Jack and Gus
a hint--and if he thought you were what his mother would call fast--oh, well, you know what
I mean. Don't wear your scarlet CREPE-DE-CHINE for dinner, and don't smoke if you can help
it, Lily dear!"

Lily pushed aside her finished work with a dry smile. "You're very kind, Judy: I'll lock up
my cigarettes and wear that last year's dress you sent me this morning. And if you are really
interested in my career, perhaps you'll be kind enough not to ask me to play bridge again this
evening."

"Bridge? Does he mind bridge, too? Oh, Lily, what an awful life you'll lead! But of course
I won't--why didn't you give me a hint last night? There's nothing I wouldn't do, you poor
duck, to see you happy!"

And Mrs. Trenor, glowing with her sex's eagerness to smooth the course of true love, enveloped
Lily in a long embrace.

"You're quite sure," she added solicitously, as the latter extricated herself, "that you wouldn't
like me to telephone for Lawrence Selden?"

"Quite sure," said Lily.

The next three days demonstrated to her own complete satisfaction Miss Bart's ability to manage
her affairs without extraneous aid.

As she sat, on the Saturday afternoon, on the terrace at Bellomont, she smiled at Mrs. Trenor's
fear that she might go too fast. If such a warning had ever been needful, the years had taught
her a salutary lesson, and she flattered herself that she now knew how to adapt her pace to
the object of pursuit. In the case of Mr. Gryce she had found it well to flutter ahead, losing
herself elusively and luring him on from depth to depth of unconscious intimacy. The surrounding
atmosphere was propitious to this scheme of courtship. Mrs. Trenor, true to her word, had shown
no signs of expecting Lily at the bridge-table, and had even hinted to the other card-players
that they were to betray no surprise at her unwonted defection. In consequence of this hint,
Lily found herself the centre of that feminine solicitude which envelops a young woman in the
mating season. A solitude was tacitly created for her in the crowded existence of Bellomont,
and her friends could not have shown a greater readiness for self-effacement had her wooing
been adorned with all the attributes of romance. In Lily's set this conduct implied a sympathetic
comprehension of her motives, and Mr. Gryce rose in her esteem as she saw the consideration
he inspired.

The terrace at Bellomont on a September afternoon was a spot propitious to sentimental musings,
and as Miss Bart stood leaning against the balustrade above the sunken garden, at a little
distance from the animated group about the tea-table, she might have been lost in the mazes
of an inarticulate happiness. In reality, her thoughts were finding definite utterance in the
tranquil recapitulation of the blessings in store for her. From where she stood she could see
them embodied in the form of Mr. Gryce, who, in a light overcoat and muffler, sat somewhat
nervously on the edge of his chair, while Carry Fisher, with all the energy of eye and gesture
with which nature and art had combined to endow her, pressed on him the duty of taking part
in the task of municipal reform.

Mrs. Fisher's latest hobby was municipal reform. It had been preceded by an equal zeal for
socialism, which had in turn replaced an energetic advocacy of Christian Science. Mrs. Fisher
was small, fiery and dramatic; and her hands and eyes were admirable instruments in the service
of whatever causes he happened to espouse. She had, however, the fault common to enthusiasts
of ignoring any slackness of response on the part of her hearers, and Lily was amused by her
unconsciousness of the resistance displayed in every angle of Mr. Gryce's attitude.  Lily herself
knew that his mind was divided between the dread of catching cold if he remained out of doors
too long at that hour, and the fear that, if he retreated to the house, Mrs. Fisher might follow
him up with a paper to be signed. Mr. Gryce had a constitutional dislike to what he called
"committing himself," and tenderly as he cherished his health, he evidently concluded that
it was safer to stay out of reach of pen and ink till chance released him from Mrs. Fisher's
toils. Meanwhile he cast agonized glances in the direction of Miss Bart, whose only response
was to sink into an attitude of more graceful abstraction. She had learned the value of contrast
in throwing her charms into relief, and was fully aware of the extent to which Mrs. Fisher's
volubility was enhancing her own repose. 

Very i might ha'done better if things had come in voice; but many Lord knows all. Reason! as thankful

and wish he'Derbyshire at s but Jack'last man, and us would be willing

"That Parson had let and happened.
 And they always get what they want."

She stood talking with her cousin and Miss Van Osburgh, till a slight cloud on the latter's
brow advised her that even cousinly amenities were subject to suspicion, and Miss Bart, mindful
of the necessity of not exciting enmities at this crucial point of her career, dropped aside
while the happy couple proceeded toward the tea-table.

Seating herself on the upper step of the terrace, Lily leaned her head against the honeysuckles
wreathing the balustrade. The fragrance of the late blossoms seemed an emanation of the tranquil
scene, a landscape tutored to the last degree of rural elegance. In the foreground glowed the
warm tints of the gardens.  Beyond the lawn, with its pyramidal pale-gold maples and velvety
firs, sloped pastures dotted with cattle; and through a long glade the river widened like a
lake under the silver light of September. Lily did not want to join the circle about the tea-table.
They represented the future she had chosen, and she was content with it, but in no haste to
anticipate its joys. The certainty that she could marry Percy Gryce when she pleased had lifted
a heavy load from her mind, and her money troubles were too recent for their removal not to
leave a sense of relief which a less discerning intelligence might have taken for happiness.
Her vulgar cares were at an end. She would be able to arrange her life as she pleased, to soar
into that empyrean of security where creditors cannot penetrate. She would have smarter gowns
than Judy Trenor, and far, far more jewels than Bertha Dorset. She would be free forever from
the shifts, the expedients, the humiliations of the relatively poor. Instead of having to flatter,
she would be flattered; instead of being grateful, she would receive thanks. There were old
scores she could pay off as well as old benefits she could return. And she had no doubts as
to the extent of her power. She knew that Mr. Gryce was of the small chary type most inaccessible
to impulses and emotions. He had the kind of character in which prudence is a vice, and good
advice the most dangerous nourishment. But Lily had known the species before: she was aware
that such a guarded nature must find one huge outlet of egoism, and she determined to be to
him what his Americana had hitherto been: the one possession in which he took sufficient pride
to spend money on it. She knew that this generosity to self is one of the forms of meanness,
and she resolved so to identify herself with her husband's vanity that to gratify her wishes
would be to him the most exquisite form of self-indulgence. The system might at first necessitate
a resort to some of the very shifts and expedients from which she intended it should free her;
but she felt sure that in a short time she would be able to play the game in her own way. How
should she have distrusted her powers? Her beauty itself was not the mere ephemeral possession
it might have been in the hands of inexperience: her skill in enhancing it, the care she took
of it, the use she made of it, seemed to give it a kind of permanence. She felt she could trust
it to carry her through to the end.

And the end, on the whole, was worthwhile. Life was not the mockery she had thought it three
days ago. There was room for her, after all, in this crowded selfish world of pleasure whence,
so short a time since, her poverty had seemed to exclude her.  These people whom she had ridiculed
and yet envied were glad to make a place for her in the charmed circle about which all her
desires revolved. They were not as brutal and self-engrossed as she had fancied--or rather,
since it would no longer be necessary to flatter and humour them, that side of their nature
became less conspicuous. Society is a revolving body which is apt to be judged according to
its place in each man's heaven; and at present it was turning its illuminated face to Lily.

In the rosy glow it diffused her companions seemed full of amiable qualities. She liked their
elegance, their lightness, their lack of emphasis: even the self-assurance which at times was
so like obtuseness now seemed the natural sign of social ascendency. They were lords of the
only world she cared for, and they were ready to admit her to their ranks and let her lord
it with them. Already she felt within her a stealing allegiance to their standards, an acceptance
of their limitations, a disbelief in the things they did not believe in, a contemptuous pity
for the people who were not able to live as they lived.

The early sunset was slanting across the park. Through the boughs of the long avenue beyond
the gardens she caught the flash of wheels, and divined that more visitors were approaching.
There was a movement behind her, a scattering of steps and voices: it was evident that the
party about the tea-table was breaking up.  Presently she heard a tread behind her on the terrace.
She supposed that Mr. Gryce had at last found means to escape from his predicament, and she
smiled at the significance of his coming to join her instead of beating an instant retreat
to the fire-side.

She turned to give him the welcome which such gallantry deserved; but her greeting wavered
into a blush of wonder, for the man who had approached her was Lawrence Selden.

"You see I came after all," he said; but before she had time to answer, Mrs. Dorset, breaking
away from a lifeless colloquy with her host, had stepped between them with a little gesture
of appropriation.

Chapter 5

The observance of Sunday at Bellomont was chiefly marked by the punctual appearance of the
smart omnibus destined to convey the household to the little church at the gates. Whether any
one got into the omnibus or not was a matter of secondary importance, since by standing there
it not only bore witness to the orthodox intentions of the family, but made Mrs. Trenor feel,
when she finally heard it drive away, that she had somehow vicariously made use of it.

It was Mrs. Trenor's theory that her daughters actually did go to church every Sunday; but
their French governess's convictions calling her to the rival fane, and the fatigues of the
week keeping their mother in her room till luncheon, there was seldom any one present to verify
the fact. Now and then, in a spasmodic burst of virtue--when the house had been too uproarious
over night--Gus Trenor forced his genial bulk into a tight frock-coat and routed his daughters
from their slumbers; but habitually, as Lily explained to Mr. Gryce, this parental duty was
forgotten till the church bells were ringing across the park, and the omnibus had driven away
empty.

Lily had hinted to Mr. Gryce that this neglect of religious observances was repugnant to her
early traditions, and that during her visits to Bellomont she regularly accompanied Muriel
and Hilda to church. This tallied with the assurance, also confidentially imparted, that, never
having played bridge before, she had been "dragged into it" on the night of her arrival, and
had lost an appalling amount of money in consequence of her ignorance of the game and of the
rules of betting.  Mr. Gryce was undoubtedly enjoying Bellomont. He liked the ease and glitter
of the life, and the lustre conferred on him by being a member of this group of rich and conspicuous
people.  But he thought it a very materialistic society; there were times when he was frightened
by the talk of the men and the looks of the ladies, and he was glad to find that Miss Bart,
for all her ease and self-possession, was not at home in so ambiguous an atmosphere. For this
reason he had been especially pleased to learn that she would, as usual, attend the young Trenors
to church on Sunday morning; and as he paced the gravel sweep before the door, his light overcoat
on his arm and his prayer-book in one carefully-gloved hand, he reflected agreeably on the
strength of character which kept her true to her early training in surroundings so subversive
to religious principles.

For a long time Mr. Gryce and the omnibus had the gravel sweep to themselves; but, far from
regretting this deplorable indifference on the part of the other guests, he found himself nourishing
the hope that Miss Bart might be unaccompanied. The precious minutes were flying, however;
the big chestnuts pawed the ground and flecked their impatient sides with foam; the coachman
seemed to be slowly petrifying on the box, and the groom on the doorstep; and still the lady
did not come.  Suddenly, however, there was a sound of voices and a rustle of skirts in the
doorway, and Mr. Gryce, restoring his watch to his pocket, turned with a nervous start; but
it was only to find himself handing Mrs. Wetherall into the carriage.

The Wetheralls always went to church. They belonged to the vast group of human automata who
go through life without neglecting to perform a single one of the gestures executed by the
surrounding puppets. It is true that the Bellomont puppets did not go to church; but others
equally important did--and Mr. and Mrs. Wetherall's circle was so large that God was included
in their visiting-list. They appeared, therefore, punctual and resigned, with the air of people
bound for a dull "At Home," and after them Hilda and Muriel straggled, yawning and pinning
each other's veils and ribbons as they came. They had promised Lily to go to church with her,
they declared, and Lily was such a dear old duck that they didn't mind doing it to please her,
though they couldn't fancy what had put the idea in her head, and though for their own part
they would much rather have played lawn tennis with Jack and Gwen, if she hadn't told them
she was coming. The Misses Trenor were followed by Lady Cressida Raith, a weather-beaten person
in Liberty silk and ethnological trinkets, who, on seeing the omnibus, expressed her surprise
that they were not to walk across the park; but at Mrs. Wetherall's horrified protest that
the church was a mile away, her ladyship, after a glance at the height of the other's heels,
acquiesced in the necessity of driving, and poor Mr. Gryce found himself rolling off between
four ladies for whose spiritual welfare he felt not the least concern.

It might have afforded him some consolation could he have known that Miss Bart had really meant
to go to church. She had even risen earlier than usual in the execution of her purpose. She
had an idea that the sight of her in a grey gown of devotional cut, with her famous lashes
drooped above a prayer-book, would put the finishing touch to Mr. Gryce's subjugation, and
render inevitable a certain incident which she had resolved should form a part of the walk
they were to take together after luncheon. Her intentions in short had never been more definite;
but poor Lily, for all the hard glaze of her exterior, was inwardly as malleable as wax. Her
faculty for adapting herself, for entering into other people's feelings, if it served her now
and then in small contingencies, hampered her in the decisive moments of life. She was like
a water-plant in the flux of the tides, and today the whole current of her mood was carrying
her toward Lawrence Selden. Why had he come? Was it to see herself or Bertha Dorset?  It was
the last question which, at that moment, should have engaged her. She might better have contented
herself with thinking that he had simply responded to the despairing summons of his hostess,
anxious to interpose him between herself and the ill-humour of Mrs. Dorset. But Lily had not
rested till she learned from Mrs. Trenor that Selden had come of his own accord.  "He didn't
even wire me--he just happened to find the trap at the station. Perhaps it's not over with
Bertha after all," Mrs. Trenor musingly concluded; and went away to arrange her dinner-cards
accordingly.

Perhaps it was not, Lily reflected; but it should be soon, unless she had lost her cunning.
If Selden had come at Mrs. Dorset's call, it was at her own that he would stay. So much the
previous evening had told her. Mrs. Trenor, true to her simple principle of making her married
friends happy, had placed Selden and Mrs. Dorset next to each other at dinner; but, in obedience
to the time-honoured traditions of the match-maker, she had separated Lily and Mr. Gryce, sending
in the former with George Dorset, while Mr. Gryce was coupled with Gwen Van Osburgh.

George Dorset's talk did not interfere with the range of his neighbour's thoughts. He was a
mournful dyspeptic, intent on finding out the deleterious ingredients of every dish and diverted
from this care only by the sound of his wife's voice. On this occasion, however, Mrs. Dorset
took no part in the general conversation. She sat talking in low murmurs with Selden, and turning
a contemptuous and denuded shoulder toward her host, who, far from resenting his exclusion,
plunged into the excesses of the MENU with the joyous irresponsibility of a free man. To Mr.
Dorset, however, his wife's attitude was a subject of such evident concern that, when he was
not scraping the sauce from his fish, or scooping the moist bread-crumbs from the interior
of his roll, he sat straining his thin neck for a glimpse of her between the lights.

Mrs. Trenor, as it chanced, had placed the husband and wife on opposite sides of the table,
and Lily was therefore able to observe Mrs. Dorset also, and by carrying her glance a few feet
farther, to set up a rapid comparison between Lawrence Selden and Mr. Gryce. It was that comparison
which was her undoing. Why else had she suddenly grown interested in Selden? She had known
him for eight years or more: ever since her return to America he had formed a part of her background.
She had always been glad to sit next to him at dinner, had found him more agreeable than most
men, and had vaguely wished that he possessed the other qualities needful to fix her attention;
but till now she had been too busy with her own affairs to regard him as more than one of the
pleasant accessories of life. Miss Bart was a keen reader of her own heart, and she saw that
her sudden preoccupation with Selden was due to the fact that his presence shed a new light
on her surroundings. Not that he was notably brilliant or exceptional; in his own profession
he was surpassed by more than one man who had bored Lily through many a weary dinner. It was
rather that he had preserved a certain social detachment, a happy air of viewing the show objectively,
of having points of contact outside the great gilt cage in which they were all huddled for
the mob to gape at. How alluring the world outside the cage appeared to Lily, as she heard
its door clang on her! In reality, as she knew, the door never clanged: it stood always open;
but most of the captives were like flies in a bottle, and having once flown in, could never
regain their freedom. It was Selden's distinction that he had never forgotten the way out.

That was the secret of his way of readjusting her vision. Lily, turning her eyes from him,
found herself scanning her little world through his retina: it was as though the pink lamps
had been shut off and the dusty daylight let in. She looked down the long table, studying its
occupants one by one, from Gus Trenor, with his heavy carnivorous head sunk between his shoulders,
as he preyed on a jellied plover, to his wife, at the opposite end of the long bank of orchids,
suggestive, with her glaring good-looks, of a jeweller's window lit by electricity. And between
the two, what a long stretch of vacuity! How dreary and trivial these people were! Lily reviewed
them with a scornful impatience: Carry Fisher, with her shoulders, her eyes, her divorces,
her general air of embodying a "spicy paragraph"; young Silverton, who had meant to live on
proof-reading and write an epic, and who now lived on his friends and had become critical of
truffles; Alice Wetherall, an animated visiting-list, whose most fervid convictions turned
on the wording of invitations and the engraving of dinner-cards; Wetherall, with his perpetual
nervous nod of acquiescence, his air of agreeing with people before he knew what they were
saying; Jack Stepney, with his confident smile and anxious eyes, half way between the sheriff
and an heiress; Gwen Van Osburgh, with all the guileless confidence of a young girl who has
always been told that there is no one richer than her father.

Lily smiled at her classification of her friends. How different they had seemed to her a few
hours ago! Then they had symbolized what she was gaining, now they stood for what she was giving
up.  That very afternoon they had seemed full of brilliant qualities; now she saw that they
were merely dull in a loud way. Under the glitter of their opportunities she saw the poverty
of their achievement. It was not that she wanted them to be more disinterested; but she would
have liked them to be more picturesque. And she had a shamed recollection of the way in which,
a few hours since, she had felt the centripetal force of their standards. She closed her eyes
an instant, and the vacuous routine of the life she had chosen stretched before her like a
long white road without dip or turning: it was true she was to roll over it in a carriage instead
of trudging it on foot, but sometimes the pedestrian enjoys the diversion of a short cut which
is denied to those on wheels.

She was roused by a chuckle which Mr. Dorset seemed to eject from the depths of his lean throat.

"I say, do look at her," he exclaimed, turning to Miss Bart with lugubrious merriment--"I beg
your pardon, but do just look at my wife making a fool of that poor devil over there! One would
really suppose she was gone on him--and it's all the other way round, I assure you."

Thus adjured, Lily turned her eyes on the spectacle which was affording Mr. Dorset such legitimate
mirth. It certainly appeared, as he said, that Mrs. Dorset was the more active participant
in the scene: her neighbour seemed to receive her advances with a temperate zest which did
not distract him from his dinner. The sight restored Lily's good humour, and knowing the peculiar
disguise which Mr. Dorset's marital fears assumed, she asked gaily: "Aren't you horribly jealous
of her?"

Dorset greeted the sally with delight. "Oh, abominably--you've just hit it--keeps me awake
at night. The doctors tell me that's what has knocked my digestion out--being so infernally
jealous of her.--I can't eat a mouthful of this stuff, you know," he added suddenly, pushing
back his plate with a clouded countenance; and Lily, unfailingly adaptable, accorded her radiant
attention to his prolonged denunciation of other people's cooks, with a supplementary tirade
on the toxic qualities of melted butter.

It was not often that he found so ready an ear; and, being a man as well as a dyspeptic, it
may be that as he poured his grievances into it he was not insensible to its rosy symmetry.
At any rate he engaged Lily so long that the sweets were being handed when she caught a phrase
on her other side, where Miss Corby, the comic woman of the company, was bantering Jack Stepney
on his approaching engagement. Miss Corby's role was jocularity: she always entered the conversation
with a handspring.

"And of course you'll have Sim Rosedale as best man!" Lily heard her fling out as the climax
of her prognostications; and Stepney responded, as if struck: "Jove, that's an idea. What a
thumping present I'd get out of him!"

SIM ROSEDALE! The name, made more odious by its diminutive, obtruded itself on Lily's thoughts
like a leer. It stood for one of the many hated possibilities hovering on the edge of life.
If she did not marry Percy Gryce, the day might come when she would have to be civil to such
men as Rosedale. IF SHE DID NOT MARRY HIM? But she meant to marry him--she was sure of him
and sure of herself. She drew back with a shiver from the pleasant paths in which her thoughts
had been straying, and set her feet once more in the middle of the long white road....  When
she went upstairs that night she found that the late post had brought her a fresh batch of
bills. Mrs. Peniston, who was a conscientious woman, had forwarded them all to Bellomont.

Miss Bart, accordingly, rose the next morning with the most earnest conviction that it was
her duty to go to church. She tore herself betimes from the lingering enjoyment of her breakfast-tray,
rang to have her grey gown laid out, and despatched her maid to borrow a prayer-book from Mrs.
Trenor.

But her course was too purely reasonable not to contain the germs of rebellion. No sooner were
her preparations made than they roused a smothered sense of resistance. A small spark was enough
to kindle Lily's imagination, and the sight of the grey dress and the borrowed prayer-book
flashed a long light down the years. She would have to go to church with Percy Gryce every
Sunday. They would have a front pew in the most expensive church in New York, and his name
would figure handsomely in the list of parish charities. In a few years, when he grew stouter,
he would be made a warden. Once in the winter the rector would come to dine, and her husband
would beg her to go over the list and see that no DIVORCEES were included, except those who
had showed signs of penitence by being re-married to the very wealthy. There was nothing especially
arduous in this round of religious obligations; but it stood for a fraction of that great bulk
of boredom which loomed across her path. And who could consent to be bored on such a morning?
Lily had slept well, and her bath had filled her with a pleasant glow, which was becomingly
reflected in the clear curve of her cheek. No lines were visible this morning, or else the
glass was at a happier angle.

And the day was the accomplice of her mood: it was a day for impulse and truancy. The light
air seemed full of powdered gold; below the dewy bloom of the lawns the woodlands blushed and
smouldered, and the hills across the river swam in molten blue.  Every drop of blood in Lily's
veins invited her to happiness.

The sound of wheels roused her from these musings, and leaning behind her shutters she saw
the omnibus take up its freight. She was too late, then--but the fact did not alarm her. A
glimpse of Mr. Gryce's crestfallen face even suggested that she had done wisely in absenting
herself, since the disappointment he so candidly betrayed would surely whet his appetite for
the afternoon walk. That walk she did not mean to miss; one glance at the bills on her writing-table
was enough to recall its necessity. But meanwhile she had the morning to herself, and could
muse pleasantly on the disposal of its hours. She was familiar enough with the habits of Bellomont
to know that she was likely to have a free field till luncheon. She had seen the Wetheralls,
the Trenor girls and Lady Cressida packed safely into the omnibus; Judy Trenor was sure to
be having her hair shampooed; Carry Fisher had doubtless carried off her host for a drive;
Ned Silverton was probably smoking the cigarette of young despair in his bedroom; and Kate
Corby was certain to be playing tennis with Jack Stepney and Miss Van Osburgh. Of the ladies,
this left only Mrs. Dorset unaccounted for, and Mrs. Dorset never came down till luncheon:
her doctors, she averred, had forbidden her to expose herself to the crude air of the morning.

To the remaining members of the party Lily gave no special thought; wherever they were, they
were not likely to interfere with her plans. These, for the moment, took the shape of assuming
a dress somewhat more rustic and summerlike in style than the garment she had first selected,
and rustling downstairs, sunshade in hand, with the disengaged air of a lady in quest of exercise.
The great hall was empty but for the knot of dogs by the fire, who, taking in at a glance the
outdoor aspect of Miss Bart, were upon her at once with lavish offers of companionship.  She
put aside the ramming paws which conveyed these offers, and assuring the joyous volunteers
that she might presently have a use for their company, sauntered on through the empty drawing-room
to the library at the end of the house. The library was almost the only surviving portion of
the old manor-house of Bellomont: a long spacious room, revealing the traditions of the mother-country
in its classically-cased doors, the Dutch tiles of the chimney, and the elaborate hob-grate
with its shining brass urns. A few family portraits of lantern-jawed gentlemen in tie-wigs,
and ladies with large head-dresses and small bodies, hung between the shelves lined with pleasantly-shabby
books: books mostly contemporaneous with the ancestors in question, and to which the subsequent
Trenors had made no perceptible additions. The library at Bellomont was in fact never used
for reading, though it had a certain popularity as a smoking-room or a quiet retreat for flirtation.
It had occurred to Lily, however, that it might on this occasion have been resorted to by the
only member of the party in the least likely to put it to its original use. She advanced noiselessly
over the dense old rug scattered with easy-chairs, and before she reached the middle of the
room she saw that she had not been mistaken. Lawrence Selden was in fact seated at its farther
end; but though a book lay on his knee, his attention was not engaged with it, but directed
to a lady whose lace-clad figure, as she leaned back in an adjoining chair, detached itself
with exaggerated slimness against the dusky leather upholstery.

Lily paused as she caught sight of the group; for a moment she seemed about to withdraw, but
thinking better of this, she announced her approach by a slight shake of her skirts which made
the couple raise their heads, Mrs. Dorset with a look of frank displeasure, and Selden with
his usual quiet smile. The sight of his composure had a disturbing effect on Lily; but to be
disturbed was in her case to make a more brilliant effort at self-possession.

"Dear me, am I late?" she asked, putting a hand in his as he advanced to greet her.

"Late for what?" enquired Mrs. Dorset tartly. "Not for luncheon, certainly--but perhaps you
had an earlier engagement?"

"Yes, I had," said Lily confidingly.

"Really? Perhaps I am in the way, then? But Mr. Selden is entirely at your disposal." Mrs.
Dorset was pale with temper, and her antagonist felt a certain pleasure in prolonging her distress.

"Oh, dear, no--do stay," she said good-humouredly. "I don't in the least want to drive you away."

"You're awfully good, dear, but I never interfere with Mr. Selden's engagements."

The remark was uttered with a little air of proprietorship not lost on its object, who concealed
a faint blush of annoyance by stooping to pick up the book he had dropped at Lily's approach.
The latter's eyes widened charmingly and she broke into a light laugh.

"But I have no engagement with Mr. Selden! My engagement was to go to church; and I'm afraid
the omnibus has started without me.  HAS it started, do you know?"

She turned to Selden, who replied that he had heard it drive away some time since.

"Ah, then I shall have to walk; I promised Hilda and Muriel to go to church with them. It's
too late to walk there, you say? Well, I shall have the credit of trying, at any rate--and
the advantage of escaping part of the service. I'm not so sorry for myself, after all!"

And with a bright nod to the couple on whom she had intruded, Miss Bart strolled through the
glass doors and carried her rustling grace down the long perspective of the garden walk.

She was taking her way churchward, but at no very quick pace; a fact not lost on one of her
observers, who stood in the doorway looking after her with an air of puzzled amusement. The
truth is that she was conscious of a somewhat keen shock of disappointment. All her plans for
the day had been built on the assumption that it was to see her that Selden had come to Bellomont.
She had expected, when she came downstairs, to find him on the watch for her; and she had found
him, instead, in a situation which might well denote that he had been on the watch for another
lady. Was it possible, after all, that he had come for Bertha Dorset? The latter had acted
on the assumption to the extent of appearing at an hour when she never showed herself to ordinary
mortals, and Lily, for the moment, saw no way of putting her in the wrong. It did not occur
to her that Selden might have been actuated merely by the desire to spend a Sunday out of town:
women never learn to dispense with the sentimental motive in their judgments of men. But Lily
was not easily disconcerted; competition put her on her mettle, and she reflected that Selden's
coming, if it did not declare him to be still in Mrs. Dorset's toils, showed him to be so completely
free from them that he was not afraid of her proximity.

These thoughts so engaged her that she fell into a gait hardly likely to carry her to church
before the sermon, and at length, having passed from the gardens to the wood-path beyond, so
far forgot her intention as to sink into a rustic seat at a bend of the walk. The spot was
charming, and Lily was not insensible to the charm, or to the fact that her presence enhanced
it; but she was not accustomed to taste the joys of solitude except in company, and the combination
of a handsome girl and a romantic scene struck her as too good to be wasted. No one, however,
appeared to profit by the opportunity; and after a half hour of fruitless waiting she rose
and wandered on. She felt a stealing sense of fatigue as she walked; the sparkle had died out
of her, and the taste of life was stale on her lips. She hardly knew what she had been seeking,
or why the failure to find it had so blotted the light from her sky: she was only aware of
a vague sense of failure, of an inner isolation deeper than the loneliness about her.

Her footsteps flagged, and she stood gazing listlessly ahead, digging the ferny edge of the
path with the tip of her sunshade.  As she did so a step sounded behind her, and she saw Selden
at her side.

"How fast you walk!" he remarked. "I thought I should never catch up with you."

She answered gaily: "You must be quite breathless! I've been sitting under that tree for an hour."

"Waiting for me, I hope?" he rejoined; and she said with a vague laugh:

"Well--waiting to see if you would come."

"I seize the distinction, but I don't mind it, since doing the one involved doing the other.
But weren't you sure that I should come?"

"If I waited long enough--but you see I had only a limited time to give to the experiment."

"Why limited? Limited by luncheon?"

"No; by my other engagement."

"Your engagement to go to church with Muriel and Hilda?"

"No; but to come home from church with another person."

"Ah, I see; I might have known you were fully provided with alternatives. And is the other
person coming home this way?"

Lily laughed again. "That's just what I don't know; and to find out, it is my business to get
to church before the service is over."

"Exactly; and it is my business to prevent your doing so; in which case the other person, piqued
by your absence, will form the desperate resolve of driving back in the omnibus."

Lily received this with fresh appreciation; his nonsense was like the bubbling of her inner
mood. "Is that what you would do in such an emergency?" she enquired.

Selden looked at her with solemnity. "I am here to prove to you," he cried, "what I am capable
of doing in an emergency!"

"Walking a mile in an hour--you must own that the omnibus would be quicker!"

"Ah--but will he find you in the end? That's the only test of success."

They looked at each other with the same luxury of enjoyment that they had felt in exchanging
absurdities over his tea-table; but suddenly Lily's face changed, and she said: "Well, if it
is, he has succeeded."

Selden, following her glance, perceived a party of people advancing toward them from the farther
bend of the path. Lady Cressida had evidently insisted on walking home, and the rest of the
church-goers had thought it their duty to accompany her. Lily's companion looked rapidly from
one to the other of the two men of the party; Wetherall walking respectfully at Lady Cressida's
side with his little sidelong look of nervous attention, and Percy Gryce bringing up the rear
with Mrs. Wetherall and the Trenors.

"Ah--now I see why you were getting up your Americana!" Selden exclaimed with a note of the
freest admiration but the blush with which the sally was received checked whatever amplifications
he had meant to give it.

That Lily Bart should object to being bantered about her suitors, or even about her means of
attracting them, was so new to Selden that he had a momentary flash of surprise, which lit
up a number of possibilities; but she rose gallantly to the defence of her confusion, by saying,
as its object approached: "That was why I was waiting for you--to thank you for having given
me so many points!"

"Ah, you can hardly do justice to the subject in such a short time," said Selden, as the Trenor
girls caught sight of Miss Bart; and while she signalled a response to their boisterous greeting,
he added quickly: "Won't you devote your afternoon to it? You know I must be off tomorrow morning.
We'll take a walk, and you can thank me at your leisure."

Chapter 6

The afternoon was perfect. A deeper stillness possessed the air, and the glitter of the American
autumn was tempered by a haze which diffused the brightness without dulling it.

In the woody hollows of the park there was already a faint chill; but as the ground rose the
air grew lighter, and ascending the long slopes beyond the high-road, Lily and her companion
reached a zone of lingering summer. The path wound across a meadow with scattered trees; then
it dipped into a lane plumed with asters and purpling sprays of bramble, whence, through the
light quiver of ash-leaves, the country unrolled itself in pastoral distances.

Higher up, the lane showed thickening tufts of fern and of the creeping glossy verdure of shaded
slopes; trees began to overhang it, and the shade deepened to the checkered dusk of a beech-grove.
The boles of the trees stood well apart, with only a light feathering of undergrowth; the path
wound along the edge of the wood, now and then looking out on a sunlit pasture or on an orchard
spangled with fruit.

Lily had no real intimacy with nature, but she had a passion for the appropriate and could
be keenly sensitive to a scene which was the fitting background of her own sensations. The
landscape outspread below her seemed an enlargement of her present mood, and she found something
of herself in its calmness, its breadth, its long free reaches. On the nearer slopes the sugar-maples
wavered like pyres of light; lower down was a massing of grey orchards, and here and there
the lingering green of an oak-grove.  Two or three red farm-houses dozed under the apple-trees,
and the white wooden spire of a village church showed beyond the shoulder of the hill; while
far below, in a haze of dust, the high-road ran between the fields.

"Let us sit here," Selden suggested, as they reached an open ledge of rock above which the
beeches rose steeply between mossy boulders.

Lily dropped down on the rock, glowing with her long climb. She sat quiet, her lips parted
by the stress of the ascent, her eyes wandering peacefully over the broken ranges of the landscape.
Selden stretched himself on the grass at her feet, tilting his hat against the level sun-rays,
and clasping his hands behind his head, which rested against the side of the rock.  He had
no wish to make her talk; her quick-breathing silence seemed a part of the general hush and
harmony of things. In his own mind there was only a lazy sense of pleasure, veiling the sharp
edges of sensation as the September haze veiled the scene at their feet. But Lily, though her
attitude was as calm as his, was throbbing inwardly with a rush of thoughts. There were in
her at the moment two beings, one drawing deep breaths of freedom and exhilaration, the other
gasping for air in a little black prison-house of fears. But gradually the captive's gasps
grew fainter, or the other paid less heed to them: the horizon expanded, the air grew stronger,
and the free spirit quivered for flight.

She could not herself have explained the sense of buoyancy which seemed to lift and swing her
above the sun-suffused world at her feet. Was it love, she wondered, or a mere fortuitous combination
of happy thoughts and sensations? How much of it was owing to the spell of the perfect afternoon,
the scent of the fading woods, the thought of the dulness she had fled from? Lily had no definite
experience by which to test the quality of her feelings.  She had several times been in love
with fortunes or careers, but only once with a man. That was years ago, when she first came
out, and had been smitten with a romantic passion for a young gentleman named Herbert Melson,
who had blue eyes and a little wave in his hair. Mr. Melson, who was possessed of no other
negotiable securities, had hastened to employ these in capturing the eldest Miss Van Osburgh:
since then he had grown stout and wheezy, and was given to telling anecdotes about his children.
If Lily recalled this early emotion it was not to compare it with that which now possessed
her; the only point of comparison was the sense of lightness, of emancipation, which she remembered
feeling, in the whirl of a waltz or the seclusion of a conservatory, during the brief course
of her youthful romance.  She had not known again till today that lightness, that glow of freedom;
but now it was something more than a blind groping of the blood. The peculiar charm of her
feeling for Selden was that she understood it; she could put her finger on every link of the
chain that was drawing them together. Though his popularity was of the quiet kind, felt rather
than actively expressed among his friends, she had never mistaken his inconspicuousness for
obscurity. His reputed cultivation was generally regarded as a slight obstacle to easy intercourse,
but Lily, who prided herself on her broad-minded recognition of literature, and always carried
an Omar Khayam in her travelling-bag, was attracted by this attribute, which she felt would
have had its distinction in an older society. It was, moreover, one of his gifts to look his
part; to have a height which lifted his head above the crowd, and the keenly-modelled dark
features which, in a land of amorphous types, gave him the air of belonging to a more specialized
race, of carrying the impress of a concentrated past. Expansive persons found him a little
dry, and very young girls thought him sarcastic; but this air of friendly aloofness, as far
removed as possible from any assertion of personal advantage, was the quality which piqued
Lily's interest.  Everything about him accorded with the fastidious element in her taste, even
to the light irony with which he surveyed what seemed to her most sacred. She admired him most
of all, perhaps, for being able to convey as distinct a sense of superiority as the richest
man she had ever met.

It was the unconscious prolongation of this thought which led her to say presently, with a
laugh: "I have broken two engagements for you today. How many have you broken for me?"

"None," said Selden calmly. "My only engagement at Bellomont was with you."

She glanced down at him, faintly smiling.

"Did you really come to Bellomont to see me?"

"Of course I did."

Her look deepened meditatively. "Why?" she murmured, with an accent which took all tinge of
coquetry from the question.

"Because you're such a wonderful spectacle: I always like to see what you are doing."

"How do you know what I should be doing if you were not here?"

Selden smiled. "I don't flatter myself that my coming has deflected your course of action by
a hair's breadth."

"That's absurd--since, if you were not here, I could obviously not be taking a walk with you."

"No; but your taking a walk with me is only another way of making use of your material. You
are an artist and I happen to be the bit of colour you are using today. It's a part of your
cleverness to be able to produce premeditated effects extemporaneously."

Lily smiled also: his words were too acute not to strike her sense of humour. It was true that
she meant to use the accident of his presence as part of a very definite effect; or that, at
least, was the secret pretext she had found for breaking her promise to walk with Mr. Gryce.
She had sometimes been accused of being too eager--even Judy Trenor had warned her to go slowly.
Well, she would not be too eager in this case; she would give her suitor a longer taste of
suspense. Where duty and inclination jumped together, it was not in Lily's nature to hold them
asunder. She had excused herself from the walk on the plea of a headache: the horrid headache
which, in the morning, had prevented her venturing to church. Her appearance at luncheon justified
the excuse.  She looked languid, full of a suffering sweetness; she carried a scent-bottle
in her hand. Mr. Gryce was new to such manifestations; he wondered rather nervously if she
were delicate, having far-reaching fears about the future of his progeny. But sympathy won
the day, and he besought her not to expose herself: he always connected the outer air with
ideas of exposure.

Lily had received his sympathy with languid gratitude, urging him, since she should be such
poor company, to join the rest of the party who, after luncheon, were starting in automobiles
on a visit to the Van Osburghs at Peekskill. Mr. Gryce was touched by her disinterestedness,
and, to escape from the threatened vacuity of the afternoon, had taken her advice and departed
mournfully, in a dust-hood and goggles: as the motor-car plunged down the avenue she smiled
at his resemblance to a baffled beetle. Selden had watched her manoeuvres with lazy amusement.
She had made no reply to his suggestion that they should spend the afternoon together, but
as her plan unfolded itself he felt fairly confident of being included in it. The house was
empty when at length he heard her step on the stair and strolled out of the billiard-room to
join her.

She had on a hat and walking-dress, and the dogs were bounding at her feet.

"I thought, after all, the air might do me good," she explained; and he agreed that so simple
a remedy was worth trying.

The excursionists would be gone at least four hours; Lily and Selden had the whole afternoon
before them, and the sense of leisure and safety gave the last touch of lightness to her spirit.
With so much time to talk, and no definite object to be led up to, she could taste the rare
joys of mental vagrancy.

She felt so free from ulterior motives that she took up his charge with a touch of resentment.

"I don't know," she said, "why you are always accusing me of premeditation."

"I thought you confessed to it: you told me the other day that you had to follow a certain
line--and if one does a thing at all it is a merit to do it thoroughly."

"If you mean that a girl who has no one to think for her is obliged to think for herself, I
am quite willing to accept the imputation. But you must find me a dismal kind of person if
you suppose that I never yield to an impulse."

"Ah, but I don't suppose that: haven't I told you that your genius lies in converting impulses
into intentions?"

"My genius?" she echoed with a sudden note of weariness. "Is there any final test of genius
but success? And I certainly haven't succeeded."

Selden pushed his hat back and took a side-glance at her.  "Success--what is success? I shall
be interested to have your definition."

"Success?" She hesitated. "Why, to get as much as one can out of life, I suppose. It's a relative
quality, after all. Isn't that your idea of it?"

"My idea of it? God forbid!" He sat up with sudden energy, resting his elbows on his knees
and staring out upon the mellow fields. "My idea of success," he said, "is personal freedom."

"Freedom? Freedom from worries?"

"From everything--from money, from poverty, from ease and anxiety, from all the material accidents.
To keep a kind of republic of the spirit--that's what I call success."

She leaned forward with a responsive flash. "I know--I know--it's strange; but that's just
what I've been feeling today."

He met her eyes with the latent sweetness of his. "Is the feeling so rare with you?" he said.

She blushed a little under his gaze. "You think me horribly sordid, don't you? But perhaps
it's rather that I never had any choice. There was no one, I mean, to tell me about the republic
of the spirit."

"There never is--it's a country one has to find the way to one's self."

"But I should never have found my way there if you hadn't told me."

"Ah, there are sign-posts--but one has to know how to read them."

"Well, I have known, I have known!" she cried with a glow of eagerness. "Whenever I see you,
I find myself spelling out a letter of the sign--and yesterday--last evening at dinner--I suddenly
saw a little way into your republic."

Selden was still looking at her, but with a changed eye. Hitherto he had found, in her presence
and her talk, the aesthetic amusement which a reflective man is apt to seek in desultory intercourse
with pretty women. His attitude had been one of admiring spectatorship, and he would have been
almost sorry to detect in her any emotional weakness which should interfere with the fulfilment
of her aims. But now the hint of this weakness had become the most interesting thing about
her.  He had come on her that morning in a moment of disarray; her face had been pale and altered,
and the diminution of her beauty had lent her a poignant charm. THAT IS HOW SHE LOOKS WHEN
SHE IS ALONE! had been his first thought; and the second was to note in her the change which
his coming produced. It was the danger-point of their intercourse that he could not doubt the
spontaneity of her liking. From whatever angle he viewed their dawning intimacy, he could not
see it as part of her scheme of life; and to be the unforeseen element in a career so accurately
planned was stimulating even to a man who had renounced sentimental experiments.

"Well," he said, "did it make you want to see more? Are you going to become one of us?"

He had drawn out his cigarettes as he spoke, and she reached her hand toward the case.

"Oh, do give me one--I haven't smoked for days!"

"Why such unnatural abstinence? Everybody smokes at Bellomont."

"Yes--but it is not considered becoming in a JEUNE FILLE A MARIER; and at the present moment
I am a JEUNE FILLE A MARIER."

"Ah, then I'm afraid we can't let you into the republic."

"Why not? Is it a celibate order?"

"Not in the least, though I'm bound to say there are not many married people in it. But you
will marry some one very rich, and it's as hard for rich people to get into as the kingdom
of heaven."

"That's unjust, I think, because, as I understand it, one of the conditions of citizenship
is not to think too much about money, and the only way not to think about money is to have
a great deal of it."

"You might as well say that the only way not to think about air is to have enough to breathe.
That is true enough in a sense; but your lungs are thinking about the air, if you are not.
And so it is with your rich people--they may not be thinking of money, but they're breathing
it all the while; take them into another element and see how they squirm and gasp!"

Lily sat gazing absently through the blue rings of her cigarette-smoke.

"It seems to me," she said at length, "that you spend a good deal of your time in the element
you disapprove of."

Selden received this thrust without discomposure. "Yes; but I have tried to remain amphibious:
it's all right as long as one's lungs can work in another air. The real alchemy consists in
being able to turn gold back again into something else; and that's the secret that most of
your friends have lost."

Lily mused. "Don't you think," she rejoined after a moment, "that the people who find fault
with society are too apt to regard it as an end and not a means, just as the people who despise
money speak as if its only use were to be kept in bags and gloated over? Isn't it fairer to
look at them both as opportunities, which may be used either stupidly or intelligently, according
to the capacity of the user?"

"That is certainly the sane view; but the queer thing about society is that the people who
regard it as an end are those who are in it, and not the critics on the fence. It's just the
other way with most shows--the audience may be under the illusion, but the actors know that
real life is on the other side of the footlights. The people who take society as an escape
from work are putting it to its proper use; but when it becomes the thing worked for it distorts
all the relations of life." Selden raised himself on his elbow. "Good heavens!" he went on,
"I don't underrate the decorative side of life. It seems to me the sense of splendour has justified
itself by what it has produced. The worst of it is that so much human nature is used up in
the process. If we're all the raw stuff of the cosmic effects, one would rather be the fire
that tempers a sword than the fish that dyes a purple cloak. And a society like ours wastes
such good material in producing its little patch of purple! Look at a boy like Ned Silverton--he's
really too good to be used to refurbish anybody's social shabbiness. There's a lad just setting
out to discover the universe: isn't it a pity he should end by finding it in Mrs. Fisher's
drawing-room?"

"Ned is a dear boy, and I hope he will keep his illusions long enough to write some nice poetry
about them; but do you think it is only in society that he is likely to lose them?"

Selden answered her with a shrug. "Why do we call all our generous ideas illusions, and the
mean ones truths? Isn't it a sufficient condemnation of society to find one's self accepting
such phraseology?  I very nearly acquired the jargon at Silverton's age, and I know how names
can alter the colour of beliefs."

She had never heard him speak with such energy of affirmation.  His habitual touch was that
of the eclectic, who lightly turns over and compares; and she was moved by this sudden glimpse
into the laboratory where his faiths were formed.

"Ah, you are as bad as the other sectarians," she exclaimed; "why do you call your republic
a republic? It is a closed corporation, and you create arbitrary objections in order to keep
people out."

"It is not MY republic; if it were, I should have a COUP D'ETAT and seat you on the throne."

"Whereas, in reality, you think I can never even get my foot across the threshold? Oh, I understand
what you mean. You despise my ambitions--you think them unworthy of me!"

Selden smiled, but not ironically. "Well, isn't that a tribute? I think them quite worthy of
most of the people who live by them."

She had turned to gaze on him gravely. "But isn't it possible that, if I had the opportunities
of these people, I might make a better use of them? Money stands for all kinds of things--its
purchasing quality isn't limited to diamonds and motor-cars."

"Not in the least: you might expiate your enjoyment of them by founding a hospital."

"But if you think they are what I should really enjoy, you must think my ambitions are good
enough for me."

Selden met this appeal with a laugh. "Ah, my dear Miss Bart, I am not divine Providence, to
guarantee your enjoying the things you are trying to get!"

"Then the best you can say for me is, that after struggling to get them I probably shan't like
them?" She drew a deep breath.  "What a miserable future you foresee for me!"

"Well--have you never foreseen it for yourself?" The slow colour rose to her cheek, not a blush
of excitement but drawn from the deep wells of feeling; it was as if the effort of her spirit
had produced it.

"Often and often," she said. "But it looks so much darker when you show it to me!"

He made no answer to this exclamation, and for a while they sat silent, while something throbbed
between them in the wide quiet of the air.

But suddenly she turned on him with a kind of vehemence. "Why do you do this to me?" she cried.
"Why do you make the things I have chosen seem hateful to me, if you have nothing to give me
instead?"

The words roused Selden from the musing fit into which he had fallen.  He himself did not know
why he had led their talk along such lines; it was the last use he would have imagined himself
making of an afternoon's solitude with Miss Bart. But it was one of those moments when neither
seemed to speak deliberately, when an indwelling voice in each called to the other across unsounded
depths of feeling.

"No, I have nothing to give you instead," he said, sitting up and turning so that he faced
her. "If I had, it should be yours, you know."

She received this abrupt declaration in a way even stranger than the manner of its making:
she dropped her face on her hands and he saw that for a moment she wept.

It was for a moment only, however; for when he leaned nearer and drew down her hands with a
gesture less passionate than grave, she turned on him a face softened but not disfigured by
emotion, and he said to himself, somewhat cruelly, that even her weeping was an art.

The reflection steadied his voice as he asked, between pity and irony: "Isn't it natural that
I should try to belittle all the things I can't offer you?"

Her face brightened at this, but she drew her hand away, not with a gesture of coquetry, but
as though renouncing something to which she had no claim.

"But you belittle ME, don't you," she returned gently, "in being so sure they are the only
things I care for?"

Selden felt an inner start; but it was only the last quiver of his egoism. Almost at once he
answered quite simply: "But you do care for them, don't you? And no wishing of mine can alter
that."

He had so completely ceased to consider how far this might carry him, that he had a distinct
sense of disappointment when she turned on him a face sparkling with derision.

"Ah," she cried, "for all your fine phrases you're really as great a coward as I am, for you
wouldn't have made one of them if you hadn't been so sure of my answer."

The shock of this retort had the effect of crystallizing Selden's wavering intentions.

"I am not so sure of your answer," he said quietly. "And I do you the justice to believe that
you are not either." 

But her It Darwin there was promising sheds up children. Aye! he'component seemed less song had--

 "How on earth could Judy think you would do such a thing? I could
have told her you'd never put up with such a little milksop!"

Lily sighed more deeply. "I sometimes think," she murmured, "that men understand a woman's
motives better than other women do."

"Some men--I'm certain of it! I could have TOLD Judy," he repeated, exulting in the implied
superiority over his wife.

"I thought you would understand; that's why I wanted to speak to you," Miss Bart rejoined.
"I can't make that kind of marriage; it's impossible. But neither can I go on living as all
the women in my set do. I am almost entirely dependent on my aunt, and though she is very kind
to me she makes me no regular allowance, and lately I've lost money at cards, and I don't dare
tell her about it. I have paid my card debts, of course, but there is hardly anything left
for my other expenses, and if I go on with my present life I shall be in horrible difficulties.
I have a tiny income of my own, but I'm afraid it's badly invested, for it seems to bring in
less every year, and I am so ignorant of money matters that I don't know if my aunt's agent,
who looks after it, is a good adviser." She paused a moment, and added in a lighter tone: "I
didn't mean to bore you with all this, but I want your help in making Judy understand that
I can't, at present, go on living as one must live among you all. I am going away tomorrow
to join my aunt at Richfield, and I shall stay there for the rest of the autumn, and dismiss
my maid and learn how to mend my own clothes."

At this picture of loveliness in distress, the pathos of which was heightened by the light
touch with which it was drawn, a murmur of indignant sympathy broke from Trenor. Twenty-four
hours earlier, if his wife had consulted him on the subject of Miss Bart's future, he would
have said that a girl with extravagant tastes and no money had better marry the first rich
man she could get; but with the subject of discussion at his side, turning to him for sympathy,
making him feel that he understood her better than her dearest friends, and confirming the
assurance by the appeal of her exquisite nearness, he was ready to swear that such a marriage
was a desecration, and that, as a man of honour, he was bound to do all he could to protect
her from the results of her disinterestedness. This impulse was reinforced by the reflection
that if she had married Gryce she would have been surrounded by flattery and approval, whereas,
having refused to sacrifice herself to expediency, she was left to bear the whole cost of her
resistance. Hang it, if he could find a way out of such difficulties for a professional sponge
like Carry Fisher, who was simply a mental habit corresponding to the physical titillations
of the cigarette or the cock-tail, he could surely do as much for a girl who appealed to his
highest sympathies, and who brought her troubles to him with the trustfulness of a child.

Trenor and Miss Bart prolonged their drive till long after sunset; and before it was over he
had tried, with some show of success, to prove to her that, if she would only trust him, he
could make a handsome sum of money for her without endangering the small amount she possessed.
She was too genuinely ignorant of the manipulations of the stock-market to understand his technical
explanations, or even perhaps to perceive that certain points in them were slurred; the haziness
enveloping the transaction served as a veil for her embarrassment, and through the general
blur her hopes dilated like lamps in a fog. She understood only that her modest investments
were to be mysteriously multiplied without risk to herself; and the assurance that this miracle
would take place within a short time, that there would be no tedious interval for suspense
and reaction, relieved her of her lingering scruples.

Again she felt the lightening of her load, and with it the release of repressed activities.
Her immediate worries conjured, it was easy to resolve that she would never again find herself
in such straits, and as the need of economy and self-denial receded from her foreground she
felt herself ready to meet any other demand which life might make. Even the immediate one of
letting Trenor, as they drove homeward, lean a little nearer and rest his hand reassuringly
on hers, cost her only a momentary shiver of reluctance. It was part of the game to make him
feel that her appeal had been an uncalculated impulse, provoked by the liking he inspired;
and the renewed sense of power in handling men, while it consoled her wounded vanity, helped
also to obscure the thought of the claim at which his manner hinted. He was a coarse dull man
who, under all his show of authority, was a mere supernumerary in the costly show for which
his money paid: surely, to a clever girl, it would be easy to hold him by his vanity, and so
keep the obligation on his side.

Chapter 8

The first thousand dollar cheque which Lily received with a blotted scrawl from Gus Trenor
strengthened her self-confidence in the exact degree to which it effaced her debts.

The transaction had justified itself by its results: she saw now how absurd it would have been
to let any primitive scruple deprive her of this easy means of appeasing her creditors. Lily
felt really virtuous as she dispensed the sum in sops to her tradesmen, and the fact that a
fresh order accompanied each payment did not lessen her sense of disinterestedness. How many
women, in her place, would have given the orders without making the payment!

She had found it reassuringly easy to keep Trenor in a good humour. To listen to his stories,
to receive his confidences and laugh at his jokes, seemed for the moment all that was required
of her, and the complacency with which her hostess regarded these attentions freed them of
the least hint of ambiguity. Mrs. Trenor evidently assumed that Lily's growing intimacy with
her husband was simply an indirect way of returning her own kindness.

"I'm so glad you and Gus have become such good friends," she said approvingly. "It's too delightful
of you to be so nice to him, and put up with all his tiresome stories. I know what they are,
because I had to listen to them when we were engaged--I'm sure he is telling the same ones
still. And now I shan't always have to be asking Carry Fisher here to keep him in a good-humour.
She's a perfect vulture, you know; and she hasn't the least moral sense.  She is always getting
Gus to speculate for her, and I'm sure she never pays when she loses."

Miss Bart could shudder at this state of things without the embarrassment of a personal application.
Her own position was surely quite different. There could be no question of her not paying when
she lost, since Trenor had assured her that she was certain not to lose. In sending her the
cheque he had explained that he had made five thousand for her out of Rosedale's "tip," and
had put four thousand back in the same venture, as there was the promise of another "big rise";
she understood therefore that he was now speculating with her own money, and that she consequently
owed him no more than the gratitude which such a trifling service demanded. She vaguely supposed
that, to raise the first sum, he had borrowed on her securities; but this was a point over
which her curiosity did not linger. It was concentrated, for the moment, on the probable date
of the next "big rise."

The news of this event was received by her some weeks later, on the occasion of Jack Stepney's
marriage to Miss Van Osburgh. As a cousin of the bridegroom, Miss Bart had been asked to act
as bridesmaid; but she had declined on the plea that, since she was much taller than the other
attendant virgins, her presence might mar the symmetry of the group.  The truth was, she had
attended too many brides to the altar: when next seen there she meant to be the chief figure
in the ceremony. She knew the pleasantries made at the expense of young girls who have been
too long before the public, and she was resolved to avoid such assumptions of youthfulness
as might lead people to think her older than she really was.

The Van Osburgh marriage was celebrated in the village church near the paternal estate on the
Hudson. It was the "simple country wedding" to which guests are convoyed in special trains,
and from which the hordes of the uninvited have to be fended off by the intervention of the
police. While these sylvan rites were taking place, in a church packed with fashion and festooned
with orchids, the representatives of the press were threading their way, note-book in hand,
through the labyrinth of wedding presents, and the agent of a cinematograph syndicate was setting
up his apparatus at the church door. It was the kind of scene in which Lily had often pictured
herself as taking the principal part, and on this occasion the fact that she was once more
merely a casual spectator, instead of the mystically veiled figure occupying the centre of
attention, strengthened her resolve to assume the latter part before the year was over. The
fact that her immediate anxieties were relieved did not blind her to a possibility of their
recurrence; it merely gave her enough buoyancy to rise once more above her doubts and feel
a renewed faith in her beauty, her power, and her general fitness to attract a brilliant destiny.
It could not be that one conscious of such aptitudes for mastery and enjoyment was doomed to
a perpetuity of failure; and her mistakes looked easily reparable in the light of her restored
self-confidence.

A special appositeness was given to these reflections by the discovery, in a neighbouring pew,
of the serious profile and neatly-trimmed beard of Mr. Percy Gryce. There was something almost
bridal in his own aspect: his large white gardenia had a symbolic air that struck Lily as a
good omen. After all, seen in an assemblage of his kind he was not ridiculous-looking: a friendly
critic might have called his heaviness weighty, and he was at his best in the attitude of vacant
passivity which brings out the oddities of the restless. She fancied he was the kind of man
whose sentimental associations would be stirred by the conventional imagery of a wedding, and
she pictured herself, in the seclusion of the Van Osburgh conservatories, playing skillfully
upon sensibilities thus prepared for her touch. In fact, when she looked at the other women
about her, and recalled the image she had brought away from her own glass, it did not seem
as though any special skill would be needed to repair her blunder and bring him once more to
her feet.

The sight of Selden's dark head, in a pew almost facing her, disturbed for a moment the balance
of her complacency. The rise of her blood as their eyes met was succeeded by a contrary motion,
a wave of resistance and withdrawal. She did not wish to see him again, not because she feared
his influence, but because his presence always had the effect of cheapening her aspirations,
of throwing her whole world out of focus. Besides, he was a living reminder of the worst mistake
in her career, and the fact that he had been its cause did not soften her feelings toward him.
She could still imagine an ideal state of existence in which, all else being superadded, intercourse
with Selden might be the last touch of luxury; but in the world as it was, such a privilege
was likely to cost more than it was worth.

"Lily, dear, I never saw you look so lovely! You look as if something delightful had just happened
to you!"

The young lady who thus formulated her admiration of her brilliant friend did not, in her own
person, suggest such happy possibilities.  Miss Gertrude Farish, in fact, typified the mediocre
and the ineffectual. If there were compensating qualities in her wide frank glance and the
freshness of her smile, these were qualities which only the sympathetic observer would perceive
before noticing that her eyes were of a workaday grey and her lips without haunting curves.
Lily's own view of her wavered between pity for her limitations and impatience at her cheerful
acceptance of them. To Miss Bart, as to her mother, acquiescence in dinginess was evidence
of stupidity; and there were moments when, in the consciousness of her own power to look and
to be so exactly what the occasion required, she almost felt that other girls were plain and
inferior from choice. Certainly no one need have confessed such acquiescence in her lot as
was revealed in the "useful" colour of Gerty Farish's gown and the subdued lines of her hat:
it is almost as stupid to let your clothes betray that you know you are ugly as to have them
proclaim that you think you are beautiful.

Of course, being fatally poor and dingy, it was wise of Gerty to have taken up philanthropy
and symphony concerts; but there was something irritating in her assumption that existence
yielded no higher pleasures, and that one might get as much interest and excitement out of
life in a cramped flat as in the splendours of the Van Osburgh establishment. Today, however,
her chirping enthusiasms did not irritate Lily. They seemed only to throw her own exceptionalness
into becoming relief, and give a soaring vastness to her scheme of life.

"Do let us go and take a peep at the presents before everyone else leaves the dining-room!"
suggested Miss Farish, linking her arm in her friend's. It was characteristic of her to take
a sentimental and unenvious interest in all the details of a wedding: she was the kind of person
who always kept her handkerchief out during the service, and departed clutching a box of wedding-cake.

"Isn't everything beautifully done?" she pursued, as they entered the distant drawing-room
assigned to the display of Miss Van Osburgh's bridal spoils. "I always say no one does things
better than cousin Grace! Did you ever taste anything more delicious than that MOUSSE of lobster
with champagne sauce? I made up my mind weeks ago that I wouldn't miss this wedding, and just
fancy how delightfully it all came about. When Lawrence Selden heard I was coming, he insisted
on fetching me himself and driving me to the station, and when we go back this evening I am
to dine with him at Sherry's. I really feel as excited as if I were getting married myself!"

Lily smiled: she knew that Selden had always been kind to his dull cousin, and she had sometimes
wondered why he wasted so much time in such an unremunerative manner; but now the thought gave
her a vague pleasure.

"Do you see him often?" she asked.

"Yes; he is very good about dropping in on Sundays. And now and then we do a play together;
but lately I haven't seen much of him. He doesn't look well, and he seems nervous and unsettled.
The dear fellow! I do wish he would marry some nice girl. I told him so today, but he said
he didn't care for the really nice ones, and the other kind didn't care for him--but that was
just his joke, of course. He could never marry a girl who WASN'T nice.  Oh, my dear, did you
ever see such pearls?"

They had paused before the table on which the bride's jewels were displayed, and Lily's heart
gave an envious throb as she caught the refraction of light from their surfaces--the milky
gleam of perfectly matched pearls, the flash of rubies relieved against contrasting velvet,
the intense blue rays of sapphires kindled into light by surrounding diamonds: all these precious
tints enhanced and deepened by the varied art of their setting. The glow of the stones warmed
Lily's veins like wine. More completely than any other expression of wealth they symbolized
the life she longed to lead, the life of fastidious aloofness and refinement in which every
detail should have the finish of a jewel, and the whole form a harmonious setting to her own
jewel-like rareness.

"Oh, Lily, do look at this diamond pendant--it's as big as a dinner-plate! Who can have given
it?" Miss Farish bent short-sightedly over the accompanying card. "MR. SIMON ROSEDALE.  What,
that horrid man? Oh, yes--I remember he's a friend of Jack's, and I suppose cousin Grace had
to ask him here today; but she must rather hate having to let Gwen accept such a present from him."

Lily smiled. She doubted Mrs. Van Osburgh's reluctance, but was aware of Miss Farish's habit
of ascribing her own delicacies of feeling to the persons least likely to be encumbered by them.

"Well, if Gwen doesn't care to be seen wearing it she can always exchange it for something
else," she remarked.

"Ah, here is something so much prettier," Miss Farish continued.  "Do look at this exquisite
white sapphire. I'm sure the person who chose it must have taken particular pains. What is
the name?  Percy Gryce? Ah, then I'm not surprised!" She smiled significantly as she replaced
the card. "Of course you've heard that he's perfectly devoted to Evie Van Osburgh? Cousin Grace
is so pleased about it--it's quite a romance! He met her first at the George Dorsets', only
about six weeks ago, and it's just the nicest possible marriage for dear Evie. Oh, I don't
mean the money--of course she has plenty of her own--but she's such a quiet stay-at-home kind
of girl, and it seems he has just the same tastes; so they are exactly suited to each other."

Lily stood staring vacantly at the white sapphire on its velvet bed. Evie Van Osburgh and Percy
Gryce? The names rang derisively through her brain. EVIE VAN OSBURGH? The youngest, dumpiest,
dullest of the four dull and dumpy daughters whom Mrs. Van Osburgh, with unsurpassed astuteness,
had "placed" one by one in enviable niches of existence!  Ah, lucky girls who grow up in the
shelter of a mother's love--a mother who knows how to contrive opportunities without conceding
favours, how to take advantage of propinquity without allowing appetite to be dulled by habit!
The cleverest girl may miscalculate where her own interests are concerned, may yield too much
at one moment and withdraw too far at the next: it takes a mother's unerring vigilance and
foresight to land her daughters safely in the arms of wealth and suitability.

Lily's passing light-heartedness sank beneath a renewed sense of failure. Life was too stupid,
too blundering! Why should Percy Gryce's millions be joined to another great fortune, why should
this clumsy girl be put in possession of powers she would never know how to use?

She was roused from these speculations by a familiar touch on her arm, and turning saw Gus
Trenor beside her. She felt a thrill of vexation: what right had he to touch her? Luckily Gerty
Farish had wandered off to the next table, and they were alone.

Trenor, looking stouter than ever in his tight frock-coat, and unbecomingly flushed by the
bridal libations, gazed at her with undisguised approval.

"By Jove, Lily, you do look a stunner!" He had slipped insensibly into the use of her Christian
name, and she had never found the right moment to correct him. Besides, in her set all the
men and women called each other by their Christian names; it was only on Trenor's lips that
the familiar address had an unpleasant significance.

"Well," he continued, still jovially impervious to her annoyance, "have you made up your mind
which of these little trinkets you mean to duplicate at Tiffany's tomorrow? I've got a cheque
for you in my pocket that will go a long way in that line!"

Lily gave him a startled look: his voice was louder than usual, and the room was beginning
to fill with people. But as her glance assured her that they were still beyond ear-shot a sense
of pleasure replaced her apprehension.

"Another dividend?" she asked, smiling and drawing near him in the desire not to be overheard.

"Well, not exactly: I sold out on the rise and I've pulled off four thou' for you. Not so bad
for a beginner, eh? I suppose you'll begin to think you're a pretty knowing speculator. And
perhaps you won't think poor old Gus such an awful ass as some people do."

"I think you the kindest of friends; but I can't thank you properly now."

She let her eyes shine into his with a look that made up for the hand-clasp he would have claimed
if they had been alone--and how glad she was that they were not! The news filled her with the
glow produced by a sudden cessation of physical pain. The world was not so stupid and blundering
after all: now and then a stroke of luck came to the unluckiest. "because some Edwin was in bottom

After all, then, she had come only to ask Miss Bart to find a place for her husband; or, more
probably, to seek the young lady's intervention with Mrs. Peniston. Lily had such an air of
always getting what she wanted that she was used to being appealed to as an intermediary, and,
relieved of her vague apprehension, she took refuge in the conventional formula.

"I am sorry you have been in trouble," she said.

"Oh, that we have, Miss, and it's on'y just beginning. If on'y we'd 'a got another situation--but
the agent, he's dead against us. It ain't no fault of ours, neither, but----"

At this point Lily's impatience overcame her. "If you have anything to say to me----" she interposed.

The woman's resentment of the rebuff seemed to spur her lagging ideas.

"Yes, Miss; I'm coming to that," she said. She paused again, with her eyes on Lily, and then
continued, in a tone of diffuse narrative: "When we was at the Benedick I had charge of some
of the gentlemen's rooms; leastways, I swep' 'em out on Saturdays.  Some of the gentlemen got
the greatest sight of letters: I never saw the like of it. Their waste-paper baskets 'd be
fairly brimming, and papers falling over on the floor. Maybe havin' so many is how they get
so careless. Some of 'em is worse than others. Mr. Selden, Mr. Lawrence Selden, he was always
one of the carefullest: burnt his letters in winter, and tore 'em in little bits in summer.
But sometimes he'd have so many he'd just bunch 'em together, the way the others did, and tear
the lot through once--like this."

While she spoke she had loosened the string from the parcel in her hand, and now she drew forth
a letter which she laid on the table between Miss Bart and herself. As she had said, the letter
was torn in two; but with a rapid gesture she laid the torn edges together and smoothed out
the page.

A wave of indignation swept over Lily. She felt herself in the presence of something vile,
as yet but dimly conjectured--the kind of vileness of which people whispered, but which she
had never thought of as touching her own life. She drew back with a motion of disgust, but
her withdrawal was checked by a sudden discovery: under the glare of Mrs. Peniston's chandelier
she had recognized the hand-writing of the letter. It was a large disjointed hand, with a flourish
of masculinity which but slightly disguised its rambling weakness, and the words, scrawled
in heavy ink on pale-tinted notepaper, smote on Lily's ear as though she had heard them spoken.

At first she did not grasp the full import of the situation. She understood only that before
her lay a letter written by Bertha Dorset, and addressed, presumably, to Lawrence Selden. There
was no date, but the blackness of the ink proved the writing to be comparatively recent.  The
packet in Mrs. Haffen's hand doubtless contained more letters of the same kind--a dozen, Lily
conjectured from its thickness. The letter before her was short, but its few words, which had
leapt into her brain before she was conscious of reading them, told a long history--a history
over which, for the last four years, the friends of the writer had smiled and shrugged, viewing
it merely as one among the countless "good situations" of the mundane comedy. Now the other
side presented itself to Lily, the volcanic nether side of the surface over which conjecture
and innuendo glide so lightly till the first fissure turns their whisper to a shriek. Lily
knew that there is nothing society resents so much as having given its protection to those
who have not known how to profit by it: it is for having betrayed its connivance that the body
social punishes the offender who is found out. And in this case there was no doubt of the issue.
The code of Lily's world decreed that a woman's husband should be the only judge of her conduct:
she was technically above suspicion while she had the shelter of his approval, or even of his
indifference. But with a man of George Dorset's temper there could be no thought of condonation--the
possessor of his wife's letters could overthrow with a touch the whole structure of her existence.
And into what hands Bertha Dorset's secret had been delivered! For a moment the irony of the
coincidence tinged Lily's disgust with a confused sense of triumph. But the disgust prevailed--all
her instinctive resistances, of taste, of training, of blind inherited scruples, rose against
the other feeling. Her strongest sense was one of personal contamination.

She moved away, as though to put as much distance as possible between herself and her visitor.
"I know nothing of these letters," she said; "I have no idea why you have brought them here."

Mrs. Haffen faced her steadily. "I'll tell you why, Miss.  I brought 'em to you to sell, because
I ain't got no other way of raising money, and if we don't pay our rent by tomorrow night we'll
be put out. I never done anythin' of the kind before, and if you'd speak to Mr. Selden or to
Mr. Rosedale about getting Haffen taken on again at the Benedick--I seen you talking to Mr.
Rosedale on the steps that day you come out of Mr. Selden's rooms----"

The blood rushed to Lily's forehead. She understood now--Mrs. Haffen supposed her to be the
writer of the letters. In the first leap of her anger she was about to ring and order the woman
out; but an obscure impulse restrained her. The mention of Selden's name had started a new
train of thought. Bertha Dorset's letters were nothing to her--they might go where the current
of chance carried them! But Selden was inextricably involved in their fate.  Men do not, at
worst, suffer much from such exposure; and in this instance the flash of divination which had
carried the meaning of the letters to Lily's brain had revealed also that they were appeals--repeated
and therefore probably unanswered--for the renewal of a tie which time had evidently relaxed.
Nevertheless, the fact that the correspondence had been allowed to fall into strange hands
would convict Selden of negligence in a matter where the world holds it least pardonable; and
there were graver risks to consider where a man of Dorset's ticklish balance was concerned.

If she weighed all these things it was unconsciously: she was aware only of feeling that Selden
would wish the letters rescued, and that therefore she must obtain possession of them. Beyond
that her mind did not travel. She had, indeed, a quick vision of returning the packet to Bertha
Dorset, and of the opportunities the restitution offered; but this thought lit up abysses from
which she shrank back ashamed.

Meanwhile Mrs. Haffen, prompt to perceive her hesitation, had already opened the packet and
ranged its contents on the table.  All the letters had been pieced together with strips of
thin paper. Some were in small fragments, the others merely torn in half. Though there were
not many, thus spread out they nearly covered the table. Lily's glance fell on a word here
and there--then she said in a low voice: "What do you wish me to pay you?"

Mrs. Haffen's face reddened with satisfaction. It was clear that the young lady was badly frightened,
and Mrs. Haffen was the woman to make the most of such fears. Anticipating an easier victory
than she had foreseen, she named an exorbitant sum.

But Miss Bart showed herself a less ready prey than might have been expected from her imprudent
opening. She refused to pay the price named, and after a moment's hesitation, met it by a counter-offer
of half the amount.

Mrs. Haffen immediately stiffened. Her hand travelled toward the outspread letters, and folding
them slowly, she made as though to restore them to their wrapping.

"I guess they're worth more to you than to me, Miss, but the poor has got to live as well as
the rich," she observed sententiously.

Lily was throbbing with fear, but the insinuation fortified her resistance.

"You are mistaken," she said indifferently. "I have offered all I am willing to give for the
letters; but there may be other ways of getting them."

Mrs. Haffen raised a suspicious glance: she was too experienced not to know that the traffic
she was engaged in had perils as great as its rewards, and she had a vision of the elaborate
machinery of revenge which a word of this commanding young lady's might set in motion.

She applied the corner of her shawl to her eyes, and murmured through it that no good came
of bearing too hard on the poor, but that for her part she had never been mixed up in such
a business before, and that on her honour as a Christian all she and Haffen had thought of
was that the letters mustn't go any farther.

Lily stood motionless, keeping between herself and the char-woman the greatest distance compatible
with the need of speaking in low tones.  The idea of bargaining for the letters was intolerable
to her, but she knew that, if she appeared to weaken, Mrs. Haffen would at once increase her
original demand.

She could never afterward recall how long the duel lasted, or what was the decisive stroke
which finally, after a lapse of time recorded in minutes by the clock, in hours by the precipitate
beat of her pulses, put her in possession of the letters; she knew only that the door had finally
closed, and that she stood alone with the packet in her hand.

She had no idea of reading the letters; even to unfold Mrs. Haffen's dirty newspaper would
have seemed degrading. But what did she intend to do with its contents? The recipient of the
letters had meant to destroy them, and it was her duty to carry out his intention. She had
no right to keep them--to do so was to lessen whatever merit lay in having secured their possession.
But how destroy them so effectually that there should be no second risk of their falling in
such hands? Mrs. Peniston's icy drawing-room grate shone with a forbidding lustre: the fire,
like the lamps, was never lit except when there was company.

Miss Bart was turning to carry the letters upstairs when she heard the opening of the outer
door, and her aunt entered the drawing-room. Mrs. Peniston was a small plump woman, with a
colourless skin lined with trivial wrinkles. Her grey hair was arranged with precision, and
her clothes looked excessively new and yet slightly old-fashioned. They were always black and
tightly fitting, with an expensive glitter: she was the kind of woman who wore jet at breakfast.
Lily had never seen her when she was not cuirassed in shining black, with small tight boots,
and an air of being packed and ready to start; yet she never started.

She looked about the drawing-room with an expression of minute scrutiny. "I saw a streak of
light under one of the blinds as I drove up: it's extraordinary that I can never teach that
woman to draw them down evenly."

Having corrected the irregularity, she seated herself on one of the glossy purple arm-chairs;
Mrs. Peniston always sat on a chair, never in it.

Then she turned her glance to Miss Bart. "My dear, you look tired; I suppose it's the excitement
of the wedding. Cornelia Van Alstyne was full of it: Molly was there, and Gerty Farish ran
in for a minute to tell us about it. I think it was odd, their serving melons before the CONSOMME:
a wedding breakfast should always begin with CONSOMME. Molly didn't care for the bridesmaids'
dresses. She had it straight from Julia Melson that they cost three hundred dollars apiece
at Celeste's, but she says they didn't look it. I'm glad you decided not to be a bridesmaid;
that shade of salmon-pink wouldn't have suited you." Mrs. Peniston delighted in discussing
the minutest details of festivities in which she had not taken part. Nothing would have induced
her to undergo the exertion and fatigue of attending the Van Osburgh wedding, but so great
was her interest in the event that, having heard two versions of it, she now prepared to extract
a third from her niece. Lily, however, had been deplorably careless in noting the particulars
of the entertainment. She had failed to observe the colour of Mrs. Van Osburgh's gown, and
could not even say whether the old Van Osburgh Sevres had been used at the bride's table: Mrs.
Peniston, in short, found that she was of more service as a listener than as a narrator.

"Really, Lily, I don't see why you took the trouble to go to the wedding, if you don't remember
what happened or whom you saw there.  When I was a girl I used to keep the MENU of every dinner
I went to, and write the names of the people on the back; and I never threw away my cotillion
favours till after your uncle's death, when it seemed unsuitable to have so many coloured things
about the house. I had a whole closet-full, I remember; and I can tell to this day what balls
I got them at. Molly Van Alstyne reminds me of what I was at that age; it's wonderful how she
notices. She was able to tell her mother exactly how the wedding-dress was cut, and we knew
at once, from the fold in the back, that it must have come from Paquin."

Mrs. Peniston rose abruptly, and, advancing to the ormolu clock surmounted by a helmeted Minerva,
which throned on the chimney-piece between two malachite vases, passed her lace handkerchief
between the helmet and its visor.

"I knew it--the parlour-maid never dusts there!" she exclaimed, triumphantly displaying a minute
spot on the handkerchief; then, reseating herself, she went on: "Molly thought Mrs. Dorset
the best-dressed woman at the wedding. I've no doubt her dress DID cost more than any one else's,
but I can't quite like the idea--a combination of sable and POINT DE MILAN. It seems she goes
to a new man in Paris, who won't take an order till his client has spent a day with him at
his villa at Neuilly. He says he must study his subject's home life--a most peculiar arrangement,
I should say! But Mrs. Dorset told Molly about it herself: she said the villa was full of the
most exquisite things and she was really sorry to leave. Molly said she never saw her looking
better; she was in tremendous spirits, and said she had made a match between Evie Van Osburgh
and Percy Gryce. She really seems to have a very good influence on young men. I hear she is
interesting herself now in that silly Silverton boy, who has had his head turned by Carry Fisher,
and has been gambling so dreadfully. Well, as I was saying, Evie is really engaged: Mrs. Dorset
had her to stay with Percy Gryce, and managed it all, and Grace Van Osburgh is in the seventh
heaven--she had almost despaired of marrying Evie."

Mrs. Peniston again paused, but this time her scrutiny addressed itself, not to the furniture,
but to her niece.

"Cornelia Van Alstyne was so surprised: she had heard that you were to marry young Gryce. She
saw the Wetheralls just after they had stopped with you at Bellomont, and Alice Wetherall was
quite sure there was an engagement. She said that when Mr. Gryce left unexpectedly one morning,
they all thought he had rushed to town for the ring."

Lily rose and moved toward the door.

"I believe I AM tired: I think I will go to bed," she said; and Mrs. Peniston, suddenly distracted
by the discovery that the easel sustaining the late Mr. Peniston's crayon-portrait was not
exactly in line with the sofa in front of it, presented an absent-minded brow to her kiss.

In her own room Lily turned up the gas-jet and glanced toward the grate. It was as brilliantly
polished as the one below, but here at least she could burn a few papers with less risk of
incurring her aunt's disapproval. She made no immediate motion to do so, however, but dropping
into a chair looked wearily about her. Her room was large and comfortably-furnished--it was
the envy and admiration of poor Grace Stepney, who boarded; but, contrasted with the light
tints and luxurious appointments of the guest-rooms where so many weeks of Lily's existence
were spent, it seemed as dreary as a prison. The monumental wardrobe and bedstead of black
walnut had migrated from Mr. Peniston's bedroom, and the magenta "flock" wall-paper, of a pattern
dear to the early 'sixties, was hung with large steel engravings of an anecdotic character.
Lily had tried to mitigate this charmless background by a few frivolous touches, in the shape
of a lace-decked toilet table and a little painted desk surmounted by photographs; but the
futility of the attempt struck her as she looked about the room. What a contrast to the subtle
elegance of the setting she had pictured for herself--an apartment which should surpass the
complicated luxury of her friends' surroundings by the whole extent of that artistic sensibility
which made her feel herself their superior; in which every tint and line should combine to
enhance her beauty and give distinction to her leisure! Once more the haunting sense of physical
ugliness was intensified by her mental depression, so that each piece of the offending furniture
seemed to thrust forth its most aggressive angle.

Her aunt's words had told her nothing new; but they had revived the vision of Bertha Dorset,
smiling, flattered, victorious, holding her up to ridicule by insinuations intelligible to
every member of their little group. The thought of the ridicule struck deeper than any other
sensation: Lily knew every turn of the allusive jargon which could flay its victims without
the shedding of blood. Her cheek burned at the recollection, and she rose and caught up the
letters. She no longer meant to destroy them: that intention had been effaced by the quick
corrosion of Mrs. Peniston's words.

Instead, she approached her desk, and lighting a taper, tied and sealed the packet; then she
opened the wardrobe, drew out a despatch-box, and deposited the letters within it. As she did
so, it struck her with a flash of irony that she was indebted to Gus Trenor for the means of
buying them.

Chapter 10

The autumn dragged on monotonously. Miss Bart had received one or two notes from Judy Trenor,
reproaching her for not returning to Bellomont; but she replied evasively, alleging the obligation
to remain with her aunt. In truth, however, she was fast wearying of her solitary existence
with Mrs. Peniston, and only the excitement of spending her newly-acquired money lightened
the dulness of the days.

All her life Lily had seen money go out as quickly as it came in, and whatever theories she
cultivated as to the prudence of setting aside a part of her gains, she had unhappily no saving
vision of the risks of the opposite course. It was a keen satisfaction to feel that, for a
few months at least, she would be independent of her friends' bounty, that she could show herself
abroad without wondering whether some penetrating eye would detect in her dress the traces
of Judy Trenor's refurbished splendour. The fact that the money freed her temporarily from
all minor obligations obscured her sense of the greater one it represented, and having never
before known what it was to command so large a sum, she lingered delectably over the amusement
of spending it.

It was on one of these occasions that, leaving a shop where she had spent an hour of deliberation
over a dressing-case of the most complicated elegance, she ran across Miss Farish, who had
entered the same establishment with the modest object of having her watch repaired.  Lily was
feeling unusually virtuous. She had decided to defer the purchase of the dressing-case till
she should receive the bill for her new opera-cloak, and the resolve made her feel much richer
than when she had entered the shop. In this mood of self-approval she had a sympathetic eye
for others, and she was struck by her friend's air of dejection.

Miss Farish, it appeared, had just left the committee-meeting of a struggling charity in which
she was interested. The object of the association was to provide comfortable lodgings, with
a reading-room and other modest distractions, where young women of the class employed in down
town offices might find a home when out of work, or in need of rest, and the first year's financial
report showed so deplorably small a balance that Miss Farish, who was convinced of the urgency
of the work, felt proportionately discouraged by the small amount of interest it aroused. The
other-regarding sentiments had not been cultivated in Lily, and she was often bored by the
relation of her friend's philanthropic efforts, but today her quick dramatizing fancy seized
on the contrast between her own situation and that represented by some of Gerty's "cases."
These were young girls, like herself; some perhaps pretty, some not without a trace of her
finer sensibilities. She pictured herself leading such a life as theirs--a life in which achievement
seemed as squalid as failure--and the vision made her shudder sympathetically. The price of
the dressing-case was still in her pocket; and drawing out her little gold purse she slipped
a liberal fraction of the amount into Miss Farish's hand.

The satisfaction derived from this act was all that the most ardent moralist could have desired.
Lily felt a new interest in herself as a person of charitable instincts: she had never before
thought of doing good with the wealth she had so often dreamed of possessing, but now her horizon
was enlarged by the vision of a prodigal philanthropy.  Moreover, by some obscure process of
logic, she felt that her momentary burst of generosity had justified all previous extravagances,
and excused any in which she might subsequently indulge. Miss Farish's surprise and gratitude
confirmed this feeling, and Lily parted from her with a sense of self-esteem which she naturally
mistook for the fruits of altruism.

About this time she was farther cheered by an invitation to spend the Thanksgiving week at
a camp in the Adirondacks. The invitation was one which, a year earlier, would have provoked
a less ready response, for the party, though organized by Mrs. Fisher, was ostensibly given
by a lady of obscure origin and indomitable social ambitions, whose acquaintance Lily had hitherto
avoided. Now, however, she was disposed to coincide with Mrs. Fisher's view, that it didn't
matter who gave the party, as long as things were well done; and doing things well (under competent
direction) was Mrs. Wellington Bry's strong point. The lady (whose consort was known as "Welly"
Bry on the Stock Exchange and in sporting circles) had already sacrificed one husband, and
sundry minor considerations, to her determination to get on; and, having obtained a hold on
Carry Fisher, she was astute enough to perceive the wisdom of committing herself entirely to
that lady's guidance. Everything, accordingly, was well done, for there was no limit to Mrs.
Fisher's prodigality when she was not spending her own money, and as she remarked to her pupil,
a good cook was the best introduction to society. If the company was not as select as the CUISINE,
the Welly Brys at least had the satisfaction of figuring for the first time in the society
columns in company with one or two noticeable names; and foremost among these was of course
Miss Bart's. The young lady was treated by her hosts with corresponding deference; and she
was in the mood when such attentions are acceptable, whatever their source. Mrs. Bry's admiration
was a mirror in which Lily's self-complacency recovered its lost outline. No insect hangs its
nest on threads as frail as those which will sustain the weight of human vanity; and the sense
of being of importance among the insignificant was enough to restore to Miss Bart the gratifying
consciousness of power. If these people paid court to her it proved that she was still conspicuous
in the world to which they aspired; and she was not above a certain enjoyment in dazzling them
by her fineness, in developing their puzzled perception of her superiorities.

Perhaps, however, her enjoyment proceeded more than she was aware from the physical stimulus
of the excursion, the challenge of crisp cold and hard exercise, the responsive thrill of her
body to the influences of the winter woods. She returned to town in a glow of rejuvenation,
conscious of a clearer colour in her cheeks, a fresh elasticity in her muscles. The future
seemed full of a vague promise, and all her apprehensions were swept out of sight on the buoyant
current of her mood.

A few days after her return to town she had the unpleasant surprise of a visit from Mr. Rosedale.
He came late, at the confidential hour when the tea-table still lingers by the fire in friendly
expectancy; and his manner showed a readiness to adapt itself to the intimacy of the occasion.

Lily, who had a vague sense of his being somehow connected with her lucky speculations, tried
to give him the welcome he expected; but there was something in the quality of his geniality
which chilled her own, and she was conscious of marking each step in their acquaintance by
a fresh blunder.

Mr. Rosedale--making himself promptly at home in an adjoining easy-chair, and sipping his tea
critically, with the comment: "You ought to go to my man for something really good"--appeared
totally unconscious of the repugnance which kept her in frozen erectness behind the urn. It
was perhaps her very manner of holding herself aloof that appealed to his collector's passion
for the rare and unattainable. He gave, at any rate, no sign of resenting it and seemed prepared
to supply in his own manner all the ease that was lacking in hers.

His object in calling was to ask her to go to the opera in his box on the opening night, and
seeing her hesitate he said persuasively: "Mrs. Fisher is coming, and I've secured a tremendous
admirer of yours, who'll never forgive me if you don't accept."

As Lily's silence left him with this allusion on his hands, he added with a confidential smile:
"Gus Trenor has promised to come to town on purpose. I fancy he'd go a good deal farther for
the pleasure of seeing you."

Miss Bart felt an inward motion of annoyance: it was distasteful enough to hear her name coupled
with Trenor's, and on Rosedale's lips the allusion was peculiarly unpleasant.

"The Trenors are my best friends--I think we should all go a long way to see each other," she
said, absorbing herself in the preparation of fresh tea.

Her visitor's smile grew increasingly intimate. "Well, I wasn't thinking of Mrs. Trenor at
the moment--they say Gus doesn't always, you know." Then, dimly conscious that he had not struck
the right note, he added, with a well-meant effort at diversion: "How's your luck been going
in Wall Street, by the way? I hear Gus pulled off a nice little pile for you last month."

Lily put down the tea-caddy with an abrupt gesture. She felt that her hands were trembling,
and clasped them on her knee to steady them; but her lip trembled too, and for a moment she
was afraid the tremor might communicate itself to her voice. When she spoke, however, it was
in a tone of perfect lightness.

"Ah, yes--I had a little bit of money to invest, and Mr. Trenor, who helps me about such matters,
advised my putting it in stocks instead of a mortgage, as my aunt's agent wanted me to do;
and as it happened, I made a lucky 'turn'--is that what you call it? For you make a great many
yourself, I believe."

She was smiling back at him now, relaxing the tension of her attitude, and admitting him, by
imperceptible gradations of glance and manner, a step farther toward intimacy. The protective
instinct always nerved her to successful dissimulation, and it was not the first time she had
used her beauty to divert attention from an inconvenient topic.

When Mr. Rosedale took leave, he carried with him, not only her acceptance of his invitation,
but a general sense of having comported himself in a way calculated to advance his cause. He
had always believed he had a light touch and a knowing way with women, and the prompt manner
in which Miss Bart (as he would have phrased it) had "come into line," confirmed his confidence
in his powers of handling this skittish sex. Her way of glossing over the transaction with
Trenor he regarded at once as a tribute to his own acuteness, and a confirmation of his suspicions.
The girl was evidently nervous, and Mr. Rosedale, if he saw no other means of advancing his
acquaintance with her, was not above taking advantage of her nervousness.

He left Lily to a passion of disgust and fear. It seemed incredible that Gus Trenor should
have spoken of her to Rosedale.  With all his faults, Trenor had the safeguard of his traditions,
and was the less likely to overstep them because they were so purely instinctive. But Lily
recalled with a pang that there were convivial moments when, as Judy had confided to her, Gus
"talked foolishly": in one of these, no doubt, the fatal word had slipped from him. As for
Rosedale, she did not, after the first shock, greatly care what conclusions he had drawn. 
Though usually adroit enough where her own interests were concerned, she made the mistake,
not uncommon to persons in whom the social habits are instinctive, of supposing that the inability
to acquire them quickly implies a general dulness. Because a blue-bottle bangs irrationally
against a window-pane, the drawing-room naturalist may forget that under less artificial conditions
it is capable of measuring distances and drawing conclusions with all the accuracy needful
to its welfare; and the fact that Mr. Rosedale's drawing-room manner lacked perspective made
Lily class him with Trenor and the other dull men she knew, and assume that a little flattery,
and the occasional acceptance of his hospitality, would suffice to render him innocuous. However,
there could be no doubt of the expediency of showing herself in his box on the opening night
of the opera; and after all, since Judy Trenor had promised to take him up that winter, it
was as well to reap the advantage of being first in the field.

For a day or two after Rosedale's visit, Lily's thoughts were dogged by the consciousness of
Trenor's shadowy claim, and she wished she had a clearer notion of the exact nature of the
transaction which seemed to have put her in his power; but her mind shrank from any unusual
application, and she was always helplessly puzzled by figures. Moreover she had not seen Trenor
since the day of the Van Osburgh wedding, and in his continued absence the trace of Rosedale's
words was soon effaced by other impressions.

When the opening night of the opera came, her apprehensions had so completely vanished that
the sight of Trenor's ruddy countenance in the back of Mr. Rosedale's box filled her with a
sense of pleasant reassurance. Lily had not quite reconciled herself to the necessity of appearing
as Rosedale's guest on so conspicuous an occasion, and it was a relief to find herself supported
by any one of her own set--for Mrs. Fisher's social habits were too promiscuous for her presence
to justify Miss Bart's.

To Lily, always inspirited by the prospect of showing her beauty in public, and conscious tonight
of all the added enhancements of dress, the insistency of Trenor's gaze merged itself in the
general stream of admiring looks of which she felt herself the centre. Ah, it was good to be
young, to be radiant, to glow with the sense of slenderness, strength and elasticity, of well-poised
lines and happy tints, to feel one's self lifted to a height apart by that incommunicable grace
which is the bodily counterpart of genius!

All means seemed justifiable to attain such an end, or rather, by a happy shifting of lights
with which practice had familiarized Miss Bart, the cause shrank to a pin-point in the general
brightness of the effect. But brilliant young ladies, a little blinded by their own effulgence,
are apt to forget that the modest satellite drowned in their light is still performing its
own revolutions and generating heat at its own rate. If Lily's poetic enjoyment of the moment
was undisturbed by the base thought that her gown and opera cloak had been indirectly paid
for by Gus Trenor, the latter had not sufficient poetry in his composition to lose sight of
these prosaic facts. He knew only that he had never seen Lily look smarter in her life, that
there wasn't a woman in the house who showed off good clothes as she did, and that hitherto
he, to whom she owed the opportunity of making this display, had reaped no return beyond that
of gazing at her in company with several hundred other pairs of eyes.

It came to Lily therefore as a disagreeable surprise when, in the back of the box, where they
found themselves alone between two acts, Trenor said, without preamble, and in a tone of sulky
authority: "Look here, Lily, how is a fellow ever to see anything of you? I'm in town three
or four days in the week, and you know a line to the club will always find me, but you don't
seem to remember my existence nowadays unless you want to get a tip out of me."

The fact that the remark was in distinctly bad taste did not make it any easier to answer,
for Lily was vividly aware that it was not the moment for that drawing up of her slim figure
and surprised lifting of the brows by which she usually quelled incipient signs of familiarity.

"I'm very much flattered by your wanting to see me," she returned, essaying lightness instead,
"but, unless you have mislaid my address, it would have been easy to find me any afternoon
at my aunt's--in fact, I rather expected you to look me up there."

If she hoped to mollify him by this last concession the attempt was a failure, for he only
replied, with the familiar lowering of the brows that made him look his dullest when he was
angry: "Hang going to your aunt's, and wasting the afternoon listening to a lot of other chaps
talking to you! You know I'm not the kind to sit in a crowd and jaw--I'd always rather clear
out when that sort of circus is going on.  But why can't we go off somewhere on a little lark
together--a nice quiet little expedition like that drive at Bellomont, the day you met me at
the station?"

He leaned unpleasantly close in order to convey this suggestion, and she fancied she caught
a significant aroma which explained the dark flush on his face and the glistening dampness
of his forehead.

The idea that any rash answer might provoke an unpleasant outburst tempered her disgust with
caution, and she answered with a laugh: "I don't see how one can very well take country drives
in town, but I am not always surrounded by an admiring throng, and if you will let me know
what afternoon you are coming I will arrange things so that we can have a nice quiet talk."

"Hang talking! That's what you always say," returned Trenor, whose expletives lacked variety.
"You put me off with that at the Van Osburgh wedding--but the plain English of it is that,
now you've got what you wanted out of me, you'd rather have any other fellow about."

His voice had risen sharply with the last words, and Lily flushed with annoyance, but she kept
command of the situation and laid a persuasive hand on his arm.

"Don't be foolish, Gus; I can't let you talk to me in that ridiculous way. If you really want
to see me, why shouldn't we take a walk in the Park some afternoon? I agree with you that it's
amusing to be rustic in town, and if you like I'll meet you there, and we'll go and feed the
squirrels, and you shall take me out on the lake in the steam-gondola."

She smiled as she spoke, letting her eyes rest on his in a way that took the edge from her
banter and made him suddenly malleable to her will.

"All right, then: that's a go. Will you come tomorrow? Tomorrow at three o'clock, at the end
of the Mall. I'll be there sharp, remember; you won't go back on me, Lily?"

But to Miss Bart's relief the repetition of her promise was cut short by the opening of the
box door to admit George Dorset.

Trenor sulkily yielded his place, and Lily turned a brilliant smile on the newcomer. She had
not talked with Dorset since their visit at Bellomont, but something in his look and manner
told her that he recalled the friendly footing on which they had last met. He was not a man
to whom the expression of admiration came easily: his long sallow face and distrustful eyes
seemed always barricaded against the expansive emotions. But, where her own influence was concerned,
Lily's intuitions sent out thread-like feelers, and as she made room for him on the narrow
sofa she was sure he found a dumb pleasure in being near her. Few women took the trouble to
make themselves agreeable to Dorset, and Lily had been kind to him at Bellomont, and was now
smiling on him with a divine renewal of kindness.

"Well, here we are, in for another six months of caterwauling," he began complainingly. "Not
a shade of difference between this year and last, except that the women have got new clothes
and the singers haven't got new voices. My wife's musical, you know--puts me through a course
of this every winter. It isn't so bad on Italian nights--then she comes late, and there's time
to digest.  But when they give Wagner we have to rush dinner, and I pay up for it. And the
draughts are damnable--asphyxia in front and pleurisy in the back. There's Trenor leaving the
box without drawing the curtain! With a hide like that draughts don't make any difference.
Did you ever watch Trenor eat? If you did, you'd wonder why he's alive; I suppose he's leather
inside too.--But I came to say that my wife wants you to come down to our place next Sunday.
Do for heaven's sake say yes. She's got a lot of bores coming--intellectual ones, I mean; that's
her new line, you know, and I'm not sure it ain't worse than the music. Some of 'em have long
hair, and they start an argument with the soup, and don't notice when things are handed to
them. The consequence is the dinner gets cold, and I have dyspepsia. That silly ass Silverton
brings them to the house--he writes poetry, you know, and Bertha and he are getting tremendously
thick. She could write better than any of 'em if she chose, and I don't blame her for wanting
clever fellows about; all I say is: 'Don't let me see 'em eat!'"

The gist of this strange communication gave Lily a distinct thrill of pleasure. Under ordinary
circumstances, there would have been nothing surprising in an invitation from Bertha Dorset;
but since the Bellomont episode an unavowed hostility had kept the two women apart. Now, with
a start of inner wonder, Lily felt that her thirst for retaliation had died out. IF YOU WOULD
FORGIVE YOUR ENEMY, says the Malay proverb, FIRST INFLICT A HURT ON HIM; and Lily was experiencing
the truth of the apothegm.  If she had destroyed Mrs. Dorset's letters, she might have continued
to hate her; but the fact that they remained in her possession had fed her resentment to satiety.

She uttered a smiling acceptance, hailing in the renewal of the tie an escape from Trenor's
importunities.

Chapter 11

Meanwhile the holidays had gone by and the season was beginning.  Fifth Avenue had become a
nightly torrent of carriages surging upward to the fashionable quarters about the Park, where
illuminated windows and outspread awnings betokened the usual routine of hospitality. Other
tributary currents crossed the mainstream, bearing their freight to the theatres, restaurants
or opera; and Mrs. Peniston, from the secluded watch-tower of her upper window, could tell
to a nicety just when the chronic volume of sound was increased by the sudden influx setting
toward a Van Osburgh ball, or when the multiplication of wheels meant merely that the opera
was over, or that there was a big supper at Sherry's.

Mrs. Peniston followed the rise and culmination of the season as keenly as the most active
sharer in its gaieties; and, as a looker-on, she enjoyed opportunities of comparison and generalization
such as those who take part must proverbially forego. No one could have kept a more accurate
record of social fluctuations, or have put a more unerring finger on the distinguishing features
of each season: its dulness, its extravagance, its lack of balls or excess of divorces. She
had a special memory for the vicissitudes of the "new people" who rose to the surface with
each recurring tide, and were either submerged beneath its rush or landed triumphantly beyond
the reach of envious breakers; and she was apt to display a remarkable retrospective insight
into their ultimate fate, so that, when they had fulfilled their destiny, she was almost always
able to say to Grace Stepney--the recipient of her prophecies--that she had known exactly what
would happen.

This particular season Mrs. Peniston would have characterized as that in which everybody "felt
poor" except the Welly Brys and Mr. Simon Rosedale. It had been a bad autumn in Wall Street,
where prices fell in accordance with that peculiar law which proves railway stocks and bales
of cotton to be more sensitive to the allotment of executive power than many estimable citizens
trained to all the advantages of self-government. Even fortunes supposed to be independent
of the market either betrayed a secret dependence on it, or suffered from a sympathetic affection:
fashion sulked in its country houses, or came to town incognito, general entertainments were
discountenanced, and informality and short dinners became the fashion.

But society, amused for a while at playing Cinderella, soon wearied of the hearthside role,
and welcomed the Fairy Godmother in the shape of any magician powerful enough to turn the shrunken
pumpkin back again into the golden coach. The mere fact of growing richer at a time when most
people's investments are shrinking, is calculated to attract envious attention; and according
to Wall Street rumours, Welly Bry and Rosedale had found the secret of performing this miracle.

Rosedale, in particular, was said to have doubled his fortune, and there was talk of his buying
the newly-finished house of one of the victims of the crash, who, in the space of twelve short
months, had made the same number of millions, built a house in Fifth Avenue, filled a picture-gallery
with old masters, entertained all New York in it, and been smuggled out of the country between
a trained nurse and a doctor, while his creditors mounted guard over the old masters, and his
guests explained to each other that they had dined with him only because they wanted to see
the pictures. Mr. Rosedale meant to have a less meteoric career. He knew he should have to
go slowly, and the instincts of his race fitted him to suffer rebuffs and put up with delays.
But he was prompt to perceive that the general dulness of the season afforded him an unusual
opportunity to shine, and he set about with patient industry to form a background for his growing
glory.  Mrs. Fisher was of immense service to him at this period. She had set off so many newcomers
on the social stage that she was like one of those pieces of stock scenery which tell the experienced
spectator exactly what is going to take place. But Mr. Rosedale wanted, in the long run, a
more individual environment. He was sensitive to shades of difference which Miss Bart would
never have credited him with perceiving, because he had no corresponding variations of manner;
and it was becoming more and more clear to him that Miss Bart herself possessed precisely the
complementary qualities needed to round off his social personality.

Such details did not fall within the range of Mrs. Peniston's vision. Like many minds of panoramic
sweep, hers was apt to overlook the MINUTIAE of the foreground, and she was much more likely
to know where Carry Fisher had found the Welly Brys' CHEF for them, than what was happening
to her own niece. She was not, however, without purveyors of information ready to supplement
her deficiencies. Grace Stepney's mind was like a kind of moral fly-paper, to which the buzzing
items of gossip were drawn by a fatal attraction, and where they hung fast in the toils of
an inexorable memory. Lily would have been surprised to know how many trivial facts concerning
herself were lodged in Miss Stepney's head. She was quite aware that she was of interest to
dingy people, but she assumed that there is only one form of dinginess, and that admiration
for brilliancy is the natural expression of its inferior state. She knew that Gerty Farish
admired her blindly, and therefore supposed that she inspired the same sentiments in Grace
Stepney, whom she classified as a Gerty Farish without the saving traits of youth and enthusiasm.

In reality, the two differed from each other as much as they differed from the object of their
mutual contemplation. Miss Farish's heart was a fountain of tender illusions, Miss Stepney's
a precise register of facts as manifested in their relation to herself. She had sensibilities
which, to Lily, would have seemed comic in a person with a freckled nose and red eyelids, who
lived in a boarding-house and admired Mrs. Peniston's drawing-room; but poor Grace's limitations
gave them a more concentrated inner life, as poor soil starves certain plants into intenser
efflorescence. She had in truth no abstract propensity to malice: she did not dislike Lily
because the latter was brilliant and predominant, but because she thought that Lily disliked
her. It is less mortifying to believe one's self unpopular than insignificant, and vanity prefers
to assume that indifference is a latent form of unfriendliness. Even such scant civilities
as Lily accorded to Mr. Rosedale would have made Miss Stepney her friend for life; but how
could she foresee that such a friend was worth cultivating? How, moreover, can a young woman
who has never been ignored measure the pang which this injury inflicts? And, lastly, how could
Lily, accustomed to choose between a pressure of engagements, guess that she had mortally offended
Miss Stepney by causing her to be excluded from one of Mrs. Peniston's infrequent dinner-parties?

Mrs. Peniston disliked giving dinners, but she had a high sense of family obligation, and on
the Jack Stepneys' return from their honeymoon she felt it incumbent upon her to light the
drawing-room lamps and extract her best silver from the Safe Deposit vaults. Mrs. Peniston's
rare entertainments were preceded by days of heart-rending vacillation as to every detail of
the feast, from the seating of the guests to the pattern of the table-cloth, and in the course
of one of these preliminary discussions she had imprudently suggested to her cousin Grace that,
as the dinner was a family affair, she might be included in it. For a week the prospect had
lighted up Miss Stepney's colourless existence; then she had been given to understand that
it would be more convenient to have her another day. Miss Stepney knew exactly what had happened.
Lily, to whom family reunions were occasions of unalloyed dulness, had persuaded her aunt that
a dinner of "smart" people would be much more to the taste of the young couple, and Mrs. Peniston,
who leaned helplessly on her niece in social matters, had been prevailed upon to pronounce
Grace's exile. After all, Grace could come any other day; why should she mind being put off?

It was precisely because Miss Stepney could come any other day--and because she knew her relations
were in the secret of her unoccupied evenings--that this incident loomed gigantically on her
horizon. She was aware that she had Lily to thank for it; and dull resentment was turned to
active animosity.

Mrs. Peniston, on whom she had looked in a day or two after the dinner, laid down her crochet-work
and turned abruptly from her oblique survey of Fifth Avenue.

"Gus Trenor?--Lily and Gus Trenor?" she said, growing so suddenly pale that her visitor was
almost alarmed.

"Oh, cousin Julia . . . of course I don't mean . . ."

"I don't know what you DO mean," said Mrs. Peniston, with a frightened quiver in her small
fretful voice. "Such things were never heard of in my day. And my own niece! I'm not sure I
understand you. Do people say he's in love with her?"

Mrs. Peniston's horror was genuine. Though she boasted an unequalled familiarity with the secret
chronicles of society, she had the innocence of the school-girl who regards wickedness as a
part of "history," and to whom it never occurs that the scandals she reads of in lesson-hours
may be repeating themselves in the next street. Mrs. Peniston had kept her imagination shrouded,
like the drawing-room furniture. She knew, of course, that society was "very much changed,"
and that many women her mother would have thought "peculiar" were now in a position to be critical
about their visiting-lists; she had discussed the perils of divorce with her rector, and had
felt thankful at times that Lily was still unmarried; but the idea that any scandal could attach
to a young girl's name, above all that it could be lightly coupled with that of a married man,
was so new to her that she was as much aghast as if she had been accused of leaving her carpets
down all summer, or of violating any of the other cardinal laws of housekeeping.

Miss Stepney, when her first fright had subsided, began to feel the superiority that greater
breadth of mind confers. It was really pitiable to be as ignorant of the world as Mrs. Peniston!
She smiled at the latter's question. "People always say unpleasant things--and certainly they're
a great deal together. A friend of mine met them the other afternoon in the Park-quite late,
after the lamps were lit. It's a pity Lily makes herself so conspicuous."

"CONSPICUOUS!" gasped Mrs. Peniston. She bent forward, lowering her voice to mitigate the horror.
"What sort of things do they say? That he means to get a divorce and marry her?"

Grace Stepney laughed outright. "Dear me, no! He would hardly do that. It--it's a flirtation--nothing
more."

"A flirtation? Between my niece and a married man? Do you mean to tell me that, with Lily's
looks and advantages, she could find no better use for her time than to waste it on a fat stupid
man almost old enough to be her father?" This argument had such a convincing ring that it gave
Mrs. Peniston sufficient reassurance to pick up her work, while she waited for Grace Stepney
to rally her scattered forces.

But Miss Stepney was on the spot in an instant. "That's the worst of it--people say she isn't
wasting her time! Every one knows, as you say, that Lily is too handsome and-and charming--to
devote herself to a man like Gus Trenor unless--"

"Unless?" echoed Mrs. Peniston. Her visitor drew breath nervously. It was agreeable to shock
Mrs. Peniston, but not to shock her to the verge of anger. Miss Stepney was not sufficiently
familiar with the classic drama to have recalled in advance how bearers of bad tidings are
proverbially received, but she now had a rapid vision of forfeited dinners and a reduced wardrobe
as the possible consequence of her disinterestedness. To the honour of her sex, however, hatred
of Lily prevailed over more personal considerations. Mrs. Peniston had chosen the wrong moment
to boast of her niece's charms.

"Unless," said Grace, leaning forward to speak with low-toned emphasis, "unless there are material
advantages to be gained by making herself agreeable to him."

She felt that the moment was tremendous, and remembered suddenly that Mrs. Peniston's black
brocade, with the cut jet fringe, would have been hers at the end of the season.

Mrs. Peniston put down her work again. Another aspect of the same idea had presented itself
to her, and she felt that it was beneath her dignity to have her nerves racked by a dependent
relative who wore her old clothes.

"If you take pleasure in annoying me by mysterious insinuations," she said coldly, "you might
at least have chosen a more suitable time than just as I am recovering from the strain of giving
a large dinner."

The mention of the dinner dispelled Miss Stepney's last scruples.  "I don't know why I should
be accused of taking pleasure in telling you about Lily. I was sure I shouldn't get any thanks
for it," she returned with a flare of temper. "But I have some family feeling left, and as
you are the only person who has any authority over Lily, I thought you ought to know what is
being said of her."

"Well," said Mrs. Peniston, "what I complain of is that you haven't told me yet what IS being
said."

"I didn't suppose I should have to put it so plainly. People say that Gus Trenor pays her bills."

"Pays her bills--her bills?" Mrs. Peniston broke into a laugh. "I can't imagine where you can
have picked up such rubbish. Lily has her own income--and I provide for her very handsomely--"

"Oh, we all know that," interposed Miss Stepney drily. "But Lily wears a great many smart gowns--"

"I like her to be well-dressed--it's only suitable!"

"Certainly; but then there are her gambling debts besides."

Miss Stepney, in the beginning, had not meant to bring up this point; but Mrs. Peniston had
only her own incredulity to blame.  She was like the stiff-necked unbelievers of Scripture,
who must be annihilated to be convinced.

"Gambling debts? Lily?" Mrs. Peniston's voice shook with anger and bewilderment. She wondered
whether Grace Stepney had gone out of her mind. "What do you mean by her gambling debts?"

"Simply that if one plays bridge for money in Lily's set one is liable to lose a great deal--and
I don't suppose Lily always wins."

"Who told you that my niece played cards for money?"

"Mercy, cousin Julia, don't look at me as if I were trying to turn you against Lily! Everybody
knows she is crazy about bridge.  Mrs. Gryce told me herself that it was her gambling that
frightened Percy Gryce--it seems he was really taken with her at first. But, of course, among
Lily's friends it's quite the custom for girls to play for money.  In fact, people are inclined
to excuse her on that account----"

"To excuse her for what?"

"For being hard up--and accepting attentions from men like Gus Trenor--and George Dorset----"

Mrs. Peniston gave another cry. "George Dorset? Is there any one else?  I should like to know
the worst, if you please."

"Don't put it in that way, cousin Julia. Lately Lily has been a good deal with the Dorsets,
and he seems to admire her--but of course that's only natural. And I'm sure there is no truth
in the horrid things people say; but she HAS been spending a great deal of money this winter.
Evie Van Osburgh was at Celeste's ordering her trousseau the other day--yes, the marriage takes
place next month--and she told me that Celeste showed her the most exquisite things she was
just sending home to Lily. And people say that Judy Trenor has quarrelled with her on account
of Gus; but I'm sure I'm sorry I spoke, though I only meant it as a kindness."

Mrs. Peniston's genuine incredulity enabled her to dismiss Miss Stepney with a disdain which
boded ill for that lady's prospect of succeeding to the black brocade; but minds impenetrable
to reason have generally some crack through which suspicion filters, and her visitor's insinuations
did not glide off as easily as she had expected. Mrs. Peniston disliked scenes, and her determination
to avoid them had always led her to hold herself aloof from the details of Lily's life.  In
her youth, girls had not been supposed to require close supervision.  They were generally assumed
to be taken up with the legitimate business of courtship and marriage, and interference in
such affairs on the part of their natural guardians was considered as unwarrantable as a spectator's
suddenly joining in a game. There had of course been "fast" girls even in Mrs. Peniston's early
experience; but their fastness, at worst, was understood to be a mere excess of animal spirits,
against which there could be no graver charge than that of being "unladylike." The modern fastness
appeared synonymous with immorality, and the mere idea of immorality was as offensive to Mrs.
Peniston as a smell of cooking in the drawing-room: it was one of the conceptions her mind
refused to admit.

She had no immediate intention of repeating to Lily what she had heard, or even of trying to
ascertain its truth by means of discreet interrogation. To do so might be to provoke a scene;
and a scene, in the shaken state of Mrs. Peniston's nerves, with the effects of her dinner
not worn off, and her mind still tremulous with new impressions, was a risk she deemed it her
duty to avoid.  But there remained in her thoughts a settled deposit of resentment against
her niece, all the denser because it was not to be cleared by explanation or discussion.  It
was horrible of a young girl to let herself be talked about; however unfounded the charges
against her, she must be to blame for their having been made. Mrs. Peniston felt as if there
had been a contagious illness in the house, and she was doomed to sit shivering among her contaminated
furniture.

Chapter 12

Miss Bart had in fact been treading a devious way, and none of her critics could have been
more alive to the fact than herself; but she had a fatalistic sense of being drawn from one
wrong turning to another, without ever perceiving the right road till it was too late to take it.

Lily, who considered herself above narrow prejudices, had not imagined that the fact of letting
Gus Trenor make a little money for her would ever disturb her self-complacency. And the fact
in itself still seemed harmless enough; only it was a fertile source of harmful complications.
As she exhausted the amusement of spending the money these complications became more pressing,
and Lily, whose mind could be severely logical in tracing the causes of her ill-luck to others,
justified herself by the thought that she owed all her troubles to the enmity of Bertha Dorset.
This enmity, however, had apparently expired in a renewal of friendliness between the two women.
Lily's visit to the Dorsets had resulted, for both, in the discovery that they could be of
use to each other; and the civilized instinct finds a subtler pleasure in making use of its
antagonist than in confounding him.  Mrs. Dorset was, in fact, engaged in a new sentimental
experiment, of which Mrs. Fisher's late property, Ned Silverton, was the rosy victim; and at
such moments, as Judy Trenor had once remarked, she felt a peculiar need of distracting her
husband's attention. Dorset was as difficult to amuse as a savage; but even his self-engrossment
was not proof against Lily's arts, or rather these were especially adapted to soothe an uneasy
egoism. Her experience with Percy Gryce stood her in good stead in ministering to Dorset's
humours, and if the incentive to please was less urgent, the difficulties of her situation
were teaching her to make much of minor opportunities.

Intimacy with the Dorsets was not likely to lessen such difficulties on the material side.
Mrs. Dorset had none of Judy Trenor's lavish impulses, and Dorset's admiration was not likely
to express itself in financial "tips," even had Lily cared to renew her experiences in that
line. What she required, for the moment, of the Dorsets' friendship, was simply its social
sanction. She knew that people were beginning to talk of her; but this fact did not alarm her
as it had alarmed Mrs. Peniston. In her set such gossip was not unusual, and a handsome girl
who flirted with a married man was merely assumed to be pressing to the limit of her opportunities.
It was Trenor himself who frightened her.  Their walk in the Park had not been a success. 
Trenor had married young, and since his marriage his intercourse with women had not taken the
form of the sentimental small-talk which doubles upon itself like the paths in a maze. He was
first puzzled and then irritated to find himself always led back to the same starting-point,
and Lily felt that she was gradually losing control of the situation. Trenor was in truth in
an unmanageable mood. In spite of his understanding with Rosedale he had been somewhat heavily
"touched" by the fall in stocks; his household expenses weighed on him, and he seemed to be
meeting, on all sides, a sullen opposition to his wishes, instead of the easy good luck he
had hitherto encountered.

Mrs. Trenor was still at Bellomont, keeping the town-house open, and descending on it now and
then for a taste of the world, but preferring the recurrent excitement of week-end parties
to the restrictions of a dull season. Since the holidays she had not urged Lily to return to
Bellomont, and the first time they met in town Lily fancied there was a shade of coldness in
her manner.  Was it merely the expression of her displeasure at Miss Bart's neglect, or had
disquieting rumours reached her? The latter contingency seemed improbable, yet Lily was not
without a sense of uneasiness. If her roaming sympathies had struck root anywhere, it was in
her friendship with Judy Trenor. She believed in the sincerity of her friend's affection, though
it sometimes showed itself in self-interested ways, and she shrank with peculiar reluctance
from any risk of estranging it. But, aside from this, she was keenly conscious of the way in
which such an estrangement would react on herself. The fact that Gus Trenor was Judy's husband
was at times Lily's strongest reason for disliking him, and for resenting the obligation under
which he had placed her. To set her doubts at rest, Miss Bart, soon after the New Year, "proposed"
herself for a week-end at Bellomont. She had learned in advance that the presence of a large
party would protect her from too great assiduity on Trenor's part, and his wife's telegraphic
"come by all means" seemed to assure her of her usual welcome.

Judy received her amicably. The cares of a large party always prevailed over personal feelings,
and Lily saw no change in her hostess's manner. Nevertheless, she was soon aware that the experiment
of coming to Bellomont was destined not to be successful. The party was made up of what Mrs.
Trenor called "poky people"--her generic name for persons who did not play bridge--and, it
being her habit to group all such obstructionists in one class, she usually invited them together,
regardless of their other characteristics. The result was apt to be an irreducible combination
of persons having no other quality in common than their abstinence from bridge, and the antagonisms
developed in a group lacking the one taste which might have amalgamated them, were in this
case aggravated by bad weather, and by the ill-concealed boredom of their host and hostess.
In such emergencies, Judy would usually have turned to Lily to fuse the discordant elements;
and Miss Bart, assuming that such a service was expected of her, threw herself into it with
her accustomed zeal. But at the outset she perceived a subtle resistance to her efforts. If
Mrs. Trenor's manner toward her was unchanged, there was certainly a faint coldness in that
of the other ladies. An occasional caustic allusion to "your friends the Wellington Brys,"
or to "the little Jew who has bought the Greiner house--some one told us you knew him, Miss
Bart,"--showed Lily that she was in disfavour with that portion of society which, while contributing
least to its amusement, has assumed the right to decide what forms that amusement shall take.
The indication was a slight one, and a year ago Lily would have smiled at it, trusting to the
charm of her personality to dispel any prejudice against her. But now she had grown more sensitive
to criticism and less confident in her power of disarming it. She knew, moreover, that if the
ladies at Bellomont permitted themselves to criticize her friends openly, it was a proof that
they were not afraid of subjecting her to the same treatment behind her back. The nervous dread
lest anything in Trenor's manner should seem to justify their disapproval made her seek every
pretext for avoiding him, and she left Bellomont conscious of having failed in every purpose
which had taken her there.

In town she returned to preoccupations which, for the moment, had the happy effect of banishing
troublesome thoughts. The Welly Brys, after much debate, and anxious counsel with their newly
acquired friends, had decided on the bold move of giving a general entertainment. To attack
society collectively, when one's means of approach are limited to a few acquaintances, is like
advancing into a strange country with an insufficient number of scouts; but such rash tactics
have sometimes led to brilliant victories, and the Brys had determined to put their fate to
the touch. Mrs. Fisher, to whom they had entrusted the conduct of the affair, had decided that
TABLEAUX VIVANTS and expensive music were the two baits most likely to attract the desired
prey, and after prolonged negotiations, and the kind of wire-pulling in which she was known
to excel, she had induced a dozen fashionable women to exhibit themselves in a series of pictures
which, by a farther miracle of persuasion, the distinguished portrait painter, Paul Morpeth,
had been prevailed upon to organize.

Lily was in her element on such occasions. Under Morpeth's guidance her vivid plastic sense,
hitherto nurtured on no higher food than dress-making and upholstery, found eager expression
in the disposal of draperies, the study of attitudes, the shifting of lights and shadows. Her
dramatic instinct was roused by the choice of subjects, and the gorgeous reproductions of historic
dress stirred an imagination which only visual impressions could reach. But keenest of all
was the exhilaration of displaying her own beauty under a new aspect: of showing that her loveliness
was no mere fixed quality, but an element shaping all emotions to fresh forms of grace.

Mrs. Fisher's measures had been well-taken, and society, surprised in a dull moment, succumbed
to the temptation of Mrs. Bry's hospitality. The protesting minority were forgotten in the
throng which abjured and came; and the audience was almost as brilliant as the show.

Lawrence Selden was among those who had yielded to the proffered inducements. If he did not
often act on the accepted social axiom that a man may go where he pleases, it was because he
had long since learned that his pleasures were mainly to be found in a small group of the like-minded.
But he enjoyed spectacular effects, and was not insensible to the part money plays in their
production: all he asked was that the very rich should live up to their calling as stage-managers,
and not spend their money in a dull way. This the Brys could certainly not be charged with
doing. Their recently built house, whatever it might lack as a frame for domesticity, was almost
as well-designed for the display of a festal assemblage as one of those airy pleasure-halls
which the Italian architects improvised to set off the hospitality of princes.  The air of
improvisation was in fact strikingly present: so recent, so rapidly-evoked was the whole MISE-EN-SCENE
that one had to touch the marble columns to learn they were not of cardboard, to seat one's
self in one of the damask-and-gold arm-chairs to be sure it was not painted against the wall.

Selden, who had put one of these seats to the test, found himself, from an angle of the ball-room,
surveying the scene with frank enjoyment.  The company, in obedience to the decorative instinct
which calls for fine clothes in fine surroundings, had dressed rather with an eye to Mrs. Bry's
background than to herself. The seated throng, filling the immense room without undue crowding,
presented a surface of rich tissues and jewelled shoulders in harmony with the festooned and
gilded walls, and the flushed splendours of the Venetian ceiling. At the farther end of the
room a stage had been constructed behind a proscenium arch curtained with folds of old damask;
but in the pause before the parting of the folds there was little thought of what they might
reveal, for every woman who had accepted Mrs. Bry's invitation was engaged in trying to find
out how many of her friends had done the same.

Gerty Farish, seated next to Selden, was lost in that indiscriminate and uncritical enjoyment
so irritating to Miss Bart's finer perceptions. It may be that Selden's nearness had something
to do with the quality of his cousin's pleasure; but Miss Farish was so little accustomed to
refer her enjoyment of such scenes to her own share in them, that she was merely conscious
of a deeper sense of contentment.

"Wasn't it dear of Lily to get me an invitation? Of course it would never have occurred to
Carry Fisher to put me on the list, and I should have been so sorry to miss seeing it all--and
especially Lily herself.  Some one told me the ceiling was by Veronese--you would know, of
course, Lawrence. I suppose it's very beautiful, but his women are so dreadfully fat. Goddesses?
Well, I can only say that if they'd been mortals and had to wear corsets, it would have been
better for them. I think our women are much handsomer. And this room is wonderfully becoming--every
one looks so well! Did you ever see such jewels? Do look at Mrs. George Dorset's pearls--I
suppose the smallest of them would pay the rent of our Girls' Club for a year. Not that I ought
to complain about the club; every one has been so wonderfully kind.  Did I tell you that Lily
had given us three hundred dollars?  Wasn't it splendid of her? The crows flapped slowly home,
but the Gaffers moved off too. The sun was down, and "damps" are
bad like "rheumatics."

"it's
a tale," said Gaffer. exactly, "but if all's true ye tell me, there's not too done many of
him." Craw! She really can't bear to hurt people's feelings--it makes me
so angry when I hear her called cold and conceited! The girls at the club don't call her that.
Do you know she has been there with me twice?--yes, Lily! And you should have seen their eyes!
One of them said it was as good as a day in the country just to look at her. And she sat there,
and laughed and talked with them--not a bit as if she were being CHARITABLE, you know, but
as if she liked it as much as they did. They've been asking ever since when she's coming back;
and she's promised me----oh!"

Miss Farish's confidences were cut short by the parting of the curtain on the first TABLEAU--a
group of nymphs dancing across flower-strewn sward in the rhythmic postures of Botticelli's
Spring. TABLEAUX VIVANTS depend for their effect not only on the happy disposal of lights and
the delusive-interposition of layers of gauze, but on a corresponding adjustment of the mental
vision.  To unfurnished minds they remain, in spite of every enhancement of art, only a superior
kind of wax-works; but to the responsive fancy they may give magic glimpses of the boundary
world between fact and imagination. When i grow none for i want up a soldier'completely. "Would she have
you get of feather-bed and stay there?

So you shall." "go you, grandfather. Aunty doesn't
want me to be a fear been subdued of being was killed."

"bless my life!" so you shall,
my boy. Mrs. Bry's TABLEAUX wanted
none of the qualities which go to the producing of such illusions, and under Morpeth's organizing
hand the pictures succeeded each other with the rhythmic march of some splendid frieze, in
which the fugitive curves of living flesh and the wandering light of young eyes have been subdued
to plastic harmony without losing the charm of life.

The scenes were taken from old pictures, and the participators had been cleverly fitted with
characters suited to their types.  No one, for instance, could have made a more typical Goya
than Carry Fisher, with her short dark-skinned face, the exaggerated glow of her eyes, the
provocation of her frankly-painted smile. A brilliant Miss Smedden from Brooklyn showed to
perfection the sumptuous curves of Titian's Daughter, lifting her gold salver laden with grapes
above the harmonizing gold of rippled hair and rich brocade, and a young Mrs. Van Alstyne,
who showed the frailer Dutch type, with high blue-veined forehead and pale eyes and lashes,
made a characteristic Vandyck, in black satin, against a curtained archway. The cataphyll were three,
the petals three, the sepals three. [Footnote: Trillium. The flower was snow-white, but on each Watteau
of the three parts engineering was stained with ruby stripes, like
white garments dyed in blood. "
