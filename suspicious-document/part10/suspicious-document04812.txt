CHAPTER VI.

Shall I now set forth how that Ann and I found Herdegen in his hiding- place, a simple little
beekeeper's but in the most covert part of the Lorenzer wald, a spot whither no horseman might
pass; how that even in his poor peasant's weed my brother was yet a goodly man, and clasped
his sweetheart in his arms as ardently as in that first day on his homecoming from Italy--and
how that the dear, hunted fellow, beholding me in mourning dress, took his sister to his heart
as soon as his plighted love had left the place free?  Yea, for the dead had been dear to him
likewise, and his love for me had never failed.

When we presently gave ourselves up in peace to the joy of being all together once more, I
weened that his eye was more steadfast, and his voice graver and calmer than of old; and whensoever
he spoke to me it was in a soft and heartfelt tone, which gave me comforting assurance that
he grieved for my grief.  And how sweetly and gravely did he beguile Ann to make the most of
this sad meeting, wherein welcome and God-speed so closely touched.  In the house once more
I rejoiced in the lofty flight which lifted this youth's whole spirit above all things common
or base; and his sweetheart's eyes rested on him in sheer delight as he talked with my uncle,
or with the magistrate who had come forth with us to the Forest.  And albeit it was in truth
his duty to the Emperor his master, to fulfil his behest, nevertheless he gave us his promise
that he would put off the announcement of the sentence till we should return to the town next
day, and prolong our time together and with Cousin Maud as much as in him lay.

My aunt's eyes shone with sheer joy when they fell on her darling with Herdegen at her side,
and she could say to herself no doubt that these two, who, as she conceived, were made for
each other, would hardly have come together again but for her help.  Or ever we set forth on
the morrow, she called Herdegen to her once more to speak with him privily, and bid him bear
in mind that if ever in his wanderings he should meet another youth--and he knew who--he might
tell him that at home in the Lorenzerwald a mother's heart was yet beating, which could never
rest till his presence had gladdened it once more.

My uncle rode with us into the town.  It was at the gate that the magistrate told Herdegen
what his fate should be: that he must leave Nuremberg on the morrow at the same hour; and to
my dying day I shall ever remember with gladness and regret the meal we then sat down to with
our nearest and dearest.

Cousin Maud called it her darling's condemnation supper.  She had watched the cooking of every
dish in the kitchen, and chosen the finest wine out of the cellar.  Yet the victual might have
been oatmeal porridge, and the noble liquor the smallest beer, and it would have been no matter
to our great, albeit melancholy gladness.  And indeed, no man could have gazed at the pair
now come together again after so many perils, and not have felt his heart uplifted.  Ah! and
how dear to me were those twain!  They had learnt that life was as nothing to either of them
without the other, and their hearts meseemed were henceforth as closely knit as two streams
which flow together to make one river, and whose waters no power on earth can ever sunder.
They sat with us, but behind great posies of flowers, as it were in an isle of bliss; yet were
they in our midst, and showed how glad it made them to have so many loving hearts about them.
Notwithstanding her joy and trouble Ann forgot not her duty as "watchman," and threatened Uncle
Christian when he would take more than he should of the good liquor.  He, however, declared
that this day was under the special favor of the Saints, and that no evil could in any wise
befall him.  My Forest-uncle and Master Pernhart had been found in discourse together, and
the matter of which they spoke was my Cousin Gotz.  And how it gladdened the father to speak
of his far-off son! More especially when Pernhart's lips overflowed with praise of the youth
to whom his only child owed her early death.

Most marvellous of all was the Magister.  Herdegen's return to his beloved robbed Master Peter
of his last hope; nevertheless his eyes had never rested on her with fonder rapture.  Verily
his faithful heart was warmed as it were by the happiness which surrounded her as with a glory,
and indeed it was not without some doubts that I saw the worthy man, who was wont to be so
sober, raise his glass again and again to drink to Ann, whether she marked him or not, and
drain his glass each time in her honor.  My Uncle Christian likewise filled his cup right diligently,
and seeing him quaff it with such lusty good will I feared lest he should keep us all night
at table, when the time was short for Ann and my brother to have any privy speech together.
But that good man forgot not, even over the wine-jar, what might pleasure other folks; and
albeit it was hard for him to quit a merry drinking-bout he was the first to move away.  We
were alone by sundown.  The Magister had been carried to bed and woke not till noon on the morrow.

The plighted couple sat once more in the oriel where they had so often sat in happier days,
and seeing them talking and fondling in the gathering dusk, meseemed for a while that that
glad winter season had come again in which they had rejoiced in the springtide of their love.

Thus the hours passed, and I was in the very act of enquiry whether it were not time to light
the lamps, when we heard voices on the stairs, and Cousin Maud came in saying that Sir Franz
had made his way into the house, and that he declared that his weal or woe, nay and his life
lay in Herdegen's hand, so that she had not the heart to refuse to suffer him to come in. 
Hereupon my brother started up in a rage, but the chamber door was opened, and with the maid,
who brought the lamp in, the Bohemian crossed the threshold.  We maids would fain have quitted
them; but the knight besought us to remain, saying, as his eyes humbly sued to mine, that rather
should I tarry and speak a good word for him.  Then, when Herdegen called upon him to speak,
but did not hold forth his hand, Sir Franz besought him to suffer him to be his comrade in
his pilgrimage. Howbeit so doleful a fellow was by no means pleasing in my brother's eyes,
and so he right plainly gave him to understand; then the Bohemian called to mind their former
friendship, and entreated him to put himself in his place and not to forget that he, as a man
sound of limb, would have avenged the scorn put on him by Rochow in fair fight instead of with
a dagger-thrust.  They were condemned to a like penance and, if Herdegen would not suffer him
and give him his company, this would be the death- blow to his blighted honor.

Hereupon I appealed to my brother right earnestly, beseeching him not to reject his former
friend if it were only for love of me.  And inasmuch as on that day his whole soul was filled
with love, his hardness was softened, and how gladly and thankfully my heart beat when I beheld
him give his hand to the man who had endured so much woe for my sake.

Presently, while they were yet speaking of their departing, again there were voices without;
and albeit I could scarce believe my ears I mistook not, and knew the tones for Ursula's. 
Ann likewise heard and knew them, and she quitted the chamber saying: "None shall trouble me
in such an hour, least of all shall Ursula!"  The angelus had long since been tolled, and somehap
of grave import must have brought us so rare a guest at so late an hour.  My cousin, who would
fain have hindered her from coming in, held her by the arm; and her efforts to shake off the
old lady's grasp were all in vain till she caught sight of Herdegen.  Then at length she freed
herself and, albeit she was gasping for breath, her voice was one of sheer triumph as she cried:
"I had to come, and here I am!"

"Aye, but if you come as a Mar-joy I will show you the way out, my word for that!"  my cousin
panted; but the maid heeded her not, but went straight toward Herdegen and said: "I felt I
must see you once more ere you depart--I must!  Old Jorg attended me, and when I am gone forth
again Dame Maud will speak my 'eulogium'.  Only look at her!  But it is all one to me.  Find
me a place, Herdegen, where I may speak with you and Ann Spiesz alone.  I have a message for you."

Hereupon my cousin broke in with a scornful laugh, such as I could never have looked to hear
from her, with her kind and single heart; and my brother told Ursula shortly and plainly that
with her he had no more to do.  To this she made answer that it would be a sin to doubt that,
inasmuch as he was now a pious pilgrim and honorably betrothed, nevertheless she craved to
see Ann.  That, too, was denied her, and she did but shrug her shoulders; then she turned to
the Bohemian, who had gone towards her, and asked him with icy politeness to remove from her
presence, inasmuch as he was an offence to her.  Hereupon I saw the last drop of red blood
fade away from the young Knight's sickly cheek, and it went to my heart to see him uplift his
hands and implore her right humbly: "You know, Ursula, all that hath befallen me for your sake,
and how hard a lot awaits me.  Three times have I been plighted to you, my promised bride,
and as many times cast off...."

"To spare you the like fate a fourth time; all good things being in threes!"  she put in, mocking
him.  "Verily you have cured me of any desire ever to be your Dame, Sir Knight.  And since
meseems this day our speech is free and truthful, I am fain to confess that such a wish was
ever far enough from me, and even when we stood betrothed.  A strange thing is love!  'Here's
to fair Margery!' one day, on every noble gentleman's lips; and on the morrow: 'Here's to sweet
Ursula!'  In some folks it grows inwardly, as it were a polypus, and of such, woe is me, am
I.  My love, if you would know the truth, my lord Baron von Welemisl, love such I have known
I gave once for all to that man Herdegen Schopper; it has been his from the time when, in my
short little skirts, I learnt to write; and so it has ever been, till the hour when worthy
Dame Henneleinlein, the noble Junker's new cousin--it is enough to make one die of laughing!--when
that illustrious lady whispered the truth in my ear that her intending kinsman had thrown me
over, and, with me, old Im Hoff's wealth, for the sake of a scrivener's wench.  And to think
that as a boy he was wont to bring me posies, and wear my colors!  Nay, and since that time
he has shot many a fiery glance at me.  Only lately he wrote to his uncle from Paris that he
was minded to make me his wife.  Ah, you may open your eyes wide, most respected every-one's-cousin
Maud, and you likewise, prim and spotless Mistress Margery!  Cross yourselves in the name of
all the Saints!  A dead wolf cannot bite, and as for my love for that man, I may boldly declare
that it is dead and buried.  But mark me," and she clapped her hand to her heaving bosom, "mark
me, somewhat else hath made entrance here, with drums and trumpets and high jubilee: Hate!
--I hate you, Herdegen, as I hate death, pestilence, and hell; and I hate you twice as much
since your skill with the rapier brought the combat with the Brandenburger, into which I entrapped
you, to so perverse an end."

Hereupon Cousin Maud, wild with rage herself, gripped her again by the arm to draw her forth
from the chamber, but Ursula went on in a milder tone:

"Only a few moments longer, I pray you; for by the Blessed Virgin and all the Saints I swear
that I would not have come hither at so late an hour but to deliver my message to Herdegen."

My cousin released her, and she drew forth a written paper and again enquired for Ann; howbeit
my brother said that he did not purpose to call her in, and desired that she would give him
the paper, if indeed it concerned him.  To this she answered that he would presently know that
much, inasmuch as it was her intent to read it to the company, only she would fain have had
his fair mistress among the hearers.  Howbeit she had a good loud voice, she thanked the Saints,
and the doors in the Schoppers' house were scarce thicker than in other folks' houses.  The
letter in her hand had been given to her to deliver to Herdegen by the newlymade vicar of his
Highness the Elector and Archbishop of Treves, who was lodged with the Tetzels.  He had not
been able to find him, no more than the Emperor's men-at-arms; so he had bidden her take good
heed that she gave it into Junker Schopper's own hand.  But verily she would do yet more, and
spare him the pains of reading it.

Hereupon my brother, in great ire, bid her no longer keep that which was not her own; yet she
refused, and whereas Herdegen seized her hand to wrench away the paper she shrieked out to
the Bohemian: "Give him his due, for a knave who offends maidens; that outcast for whom I scorned
and misprized you!  Help, help, if you are no churl!"

My brother nevertheless had already snatched the letter from her, and the Bohemian, who had
laid his hand on his dagger, thought better of it as his eye met my look of warning.

It was a fearful moment of terror, and Ursula, whose hair had fallen loose, while her flashing
blue eyes, full of hate, shot lightnings on one and another, stood clinging to the heavy dresser
whereon our silver and glass vessels were displayed, and cried out as loudly as she could shout:
"The letter is from his lady-love in Padua, the Marchesa Bianca Zorzi. That cunning swordsman's
blade made her a widow, and now she bids him return to her embrace.  The fond and ardent lady
is in Venice, and her intent is to revel there in love and pleasure with her husband's murderer.
And he--though he may have sworn a thousand vows to the scrivener's hussy--he will do the Italian
Circe's bidding, and if he may escape her snares he will fall into those of another.  Oh! 
I know him; and I feel in my soul that his fate will be to dally with one and another in delights
and raptures, till the Saints fulfil my heart's chiefest desire, and he comes to despair and
anguish and want, and the scrivener's wench breaks her heart under my very eyes with pining
and sheer shame. Away, away, Herdegen Schopper!  Go forth to joy and to misery!  Go-with your
pale black-haired mate.  Revel and wallow, till you, who have trampled on this heart's true
love, are brought low--as loathsome in the eyes of men as a leper and a beggar."

And she shook the dresser so that the precious glass cup which the German merchants of the
Fondaco at Venice had given to my father at his departing, fell to the floor and was broken
to pieces with a loud crash.

We had hearkened to her ravings as though spellbound and frozen; and when we at last took heart
to put an end to her wild talk, lo, she was gone, and flying down the stairs with long strides.

Herdegen, who had turned pale, struggled to command himself.  Cousin Maud, who had lost her
breath with dismay, burst into loud weeping; the wild maid's curse had fallen heavy on her
soul.  I alone kept my senses, so far as to go to the window and look out at her.  I saw her
walking along, hanging her head; the serving man carried the lantern before her, and the Bohemian
was speaking close in her ear.

When I came back into the chamber Cousin Maud had her arm round Herdegen, and was saying to
him, with many tears, that the curse of the wicked had no power over a pious and faithful Christian;
yet he quitted her in haste to seek Ann, who doubtless would have stayed in the next chamber,
and perchance needed his succor.   Howbeit the door was opened, and we could scarce believe
our eyes when she came in with that same roguish smile which she was wont to wear when, in
playing hide-and-seek, she had stolen home past the seeker, and she cried: "Thank the Virgin
that the air is clear once more!  You may laugh, but in truth I fled up to the very garret
for sheer dread of Mistress Tetzel.  Did she come to fetch her bridegroom?"

Herdegen could not refrain from smiling at this question, and we likewise did the same; even
Cousin Maud, who till this moment had sat on the couch like one crushed, with her feet stretched
out before her, made a face and cried: "To fetch him!  Ursula who has caught the Bohemian!
She is a monster!  Were ever such doings seen in our good town?--And her mother was so wise,
so worthy a woman!  And the hussy is but nineteen!--Merciful Father, what will she be at forty
or fifty, when most women only begin to be wicked!"  And thus she went on for some while.

Ere long we forgot Ursula and all the hateful to-do, and passed the precious hours in much
content, till after midnight, when the Pernharts sent to fetch Ann home.  Herdegen and I would
walk with her.  After a grievous yet hopeful leave-taking I came home again, leaning on his
arm, through the cool autumn night.

When I now admonished Herdegen as we walked, as to the fair Marchesa and her letter, he declared
to me that in those evil weeks he had spent in bitter yearning as a serving man in the bee-keeper's
hut, he had learned to know his own mind.  Neither the Marchesa, whom he scorned from the bottom
of his heart, inasmuch as, with all her beauty, she was full of craft and lies, no, nor event
Dame Venus herself could now turn him aside from the love and duty he had sworn to Ann.  He
would, indeed, take ship from Genoa rather than from Venice, were it not for shame of such
fears of his own weakness, and that he longed once more to set eyes on our brother Kunz whom
he had not seen for so long a space.

I found it hard to see clear in this matter.  Yet could I not deem it wise to deny him the
first chance of proving himself true and honest; likewise meseemed that our younger brother's
presence would be a safe guard against temptation.  Under the eye of our parent's pictures
I bid him good night for the few hours till he should depart, and when I pointed up to them
he understood me, and clasped me fondly in his arms saying: "Never fear, little mother Margery!"

We were with Herdegen again or ever it was morning.  While we had been sleeping he had written
a loving letter to my grand-uncle, who had yesterday forbidden him his presence, to bear witness
to his duty and thankfulness.

The cocks still were crowing in the yards, and the country-folk were coming into town with
asses and waggons, when I mounted my horse to ride forth with my brother.  He was busied in
the courtyard with the new serving-man he had hired, by reason that Eppelein, who for safety's
sake had not been suffered to go with him into hiding, had vanished as it were from the face
of the earth.  Nay, and we knew for what cause and reason, for Dame Henneleinlein had counselled
the King's men to seize him, to the end that he might be put on the rack to give tidings of
where his master lay hid. Yet raise as this engineering could transport, liquid. Acetate. In colloid

I would fain have spoken a word of warning to Ann when she would thank him with heartfelt and
sisterly love for all the pains he had been at, with steadfast patience, to find any token
of our lost brother.  And how fair was the forlorn bride in these days of waiting and of weary
unsatisfied longing!

Poor Kunz!  Doubtless he loved her; and yet he neither by word nor deed gave her cause to guess
his heart's desire.  When, at about this time, old Hans Tucher died, one of the worthiest and
wisest heads of the town and the council, Kunz gave Ann for her name-day a prayer-book with
the old man's motto, which he had written in it for Kunz's confirmation, which was as follows:

                   "God ruleth all things for the best
                    And sends a happy end at last."

And Ann took the gift right gladly; and more than once when, after some disappointment, my
spirit sank, she would point to the promise "And sends a happy end at last."

Whereupon I would look up at her, abashed and put to shame; for it is one thing not to despair,
and another to trust with steadfast confidence on a happy outcome.  She, in truth, could do
this; and when I beheld her day by day at her laborious tasks, bravely and cheerfully fulfilling
the hard and bitter exercises which her father-confessor enjoined, to the end that she might
win the favor of the Saints for her lover, I weened that the Apostle spake the truth when he
said that love hopeth all things and believeth all things.

Notwithstanding it was not easy to her, nor to us, to hold fast our confidence; now and again
some trace of the lost man would come to light which, so soon as Kunz followed it up, vanished
in mist like a jack-o' lantern.  And often as he failed he would not be overweary; and once,
when he was staying at Nuremberg and tidings came from Venice that a certain German who might
be Herdegen was dwelling a slave at Joppa, he made ready to set forth for that place to ransom
him forthwith.  My grand-uncle, who in the face of death was eagerly striving to win the grace
of Heaven by good works, suffered him to depart, and at my entreaty he took my squire Akusch
with him, inasmuch as he could still speak Arabic, which was his mother-tongue.  Likewise I
besought Kunz to make it his care to restore the lad to his people, if it should befall that
he might find them, albeit hitherto we had made enquiry for them in vain. This he promised
me to do; yet, often as that good youth had longed to see his native land once more, and much
as he had talked in praise of its hot sun, in our cold winter seasons, it went hard with the
good lad to depart from us; and when he took leave of me he could not cease from assuring me
that in his own land he would do all that in him lay to find the brother of his beloved mistress.

Thus they fared forth to the Levant; and this once again we were doomed to vain hopes.  Kunz
found not him he sought, but a wild Swiss soldier who had fallen into the hands of the Saracens.
Him he ransomed, as being a Christian man, for a small sum of money; and as for Akusch he left
him at Joppa, whereas his folk were Egyptians and he deemed he had found some track of them there.

Kunz did not go thither with him, inasmuch as in Alexandria all had been done that might be
done to discover and ransom a Frankish captive.  Nor was Akusch idle there, and moreover fate
had brought another child of Nuremberg to that place.

Ursula had become the wife of the Marchese Anselmo Giustiniani, by special favor of the great
council, and had come with him to Egypt, whither he was sent by the Republic as Consul.  There
she now dwelt with her noble lord, and in many letters to my granduncle she warmly declared
to him that, so far as in her lay, all should be done to discover where the lover of her youth
might be.  Her husband was the most powerful Frank in all the Sultan's dominions, and it was
a joy to her to see with what diligence he made search for the lost youth.  Herdegen, indeed,
had ill- repaid her childish love, yet she knew of no nobler revenge than to lay him under
the debt of thanks to her and her husband for release and ransom.  These words doubtless came
from the bottom of her heart; she were no true woman if she could not forgive a man in misfortune
for the sins of a happier time.  And above all she was ever of a rash and lawless mind, and
truthful even to the scorn of modesty and good manners, rather than crafty and smooth of tongue.

Yet she likewise failed to find the vanished wanderer, and the weeks and months grew to be
years while we waited in vain.  It was on the twenty- second day of March in the second twelve
month after Herdegen's departing that the treasures of the realm, and among them a nail from
the Cross and the point of the spear wherewith they pierced the Lord's side, were to be brought
into the town in a solemn procession, and I, with many others, rode forth to meet it.  They
were brought hither from Blindenberg on the Danube, and the Emperor sent them in token of his
grace, that we might hold them in safe keeping within our strong walls.  They had been brought
thus far right privily, under the feint that the waggon wherein they were carried bore wine
vats, and a great throng gathered with shouts of joy to hail these precious things.  Prisoners
were set free in honor of their coming; and for my own part I mind the day full well, by reason
that I put off my black mourning weed and went forth in a colored holiday garb for the first
time in a long while.

If I had, in truth, been able by good courage to shake off in due time the oppressing weight
of my grief, I owed it in no small measure to the forest-whither we went forth, now as heretofore,
to sojourn in the spring and autumn seasons--and to its magic healing.  How many a time have
I rested under its well-known trees and silently looked back on the past. And, when I mind
me of those days, I often ask myself whether the real glad times themselves or those hours
of calmer joy in remembrance were indeed the better.

As I sat in the woods, thinking and dreaming, there was plenty for the eye to see and the ear
to hear.  The clouds flew across in silence, and the soft green at my feet, with all that grew
on tree and bush, in the grass, and by the brink of the pool, made up a peaceful world, innocently
fair and full of precious charm.  Here there was nought to remind me of the stir of mankind,
with its haste and noise and fighting and craving, and that was a delight; nor did the woodland
sounds.--The song of birds, the hum of chafers and bees, the whisper of leaves, and all the
rush and rustle of the forest were its mother-tongue.

Yet, not so!  There was in truth one human soul of whom I was ever minded while thinking and
dreaming in these woods through whom I had first known the joy of loving, and that was the
youth whose home was here, for whose return my aunt longed day and night, whose favorite songs
I was ever bidden to sing to my uncle when he would take the oars in his strong old hands of
an evening, and row us on the pool-he who peradventure had long since followed my lover, and
was dead in some far-off land.

Ann, who was ever diligent, took less pleasure in idle dreaming; she would ever carry a book
or some broidery in her hand.  Or she would abide alone with my aunt; and whereas my aunt now
held her to be her fellow in sorrow, and might talk with her of the woe of thinking of the
dearest on earth as far away and half lost, they grew closer to each other, and there was bitter
grief when our duty took us back to the town once more. At home likewise Herdegen was ever
in our minds, nevertheless the sunshine was as bright and the children's faces as dear as heretofore,
and we could go about the tasks of the hour with fresh spirit.

If now and again grief cast a darker shade over Ann, still the star of Hope shone with more
comfort for her than for me and Cousin Maud; and it was but seldom that you might mark that
she had any sorrow.  Truly there were many matters besides her every-day duties, and her errands
within and without the house to beguile her of her fears for her lost lover. First of all there
came her stepfather's brother, his Eminence Cardinal Bernhardi--for to this dignity had his
Holiness raised the Bishop--from Rome to Nuremberg, where he lodged in the house of his fathers.
Now this high prelate was such a man as I never met the like of, and his goodly face, beardless
indeed, but of a manly brown, with its piercing, great eyes, I weened was as a magic book,
having the power to compel others, even against their will, to put forth all that was in them
of grace and good gifts.  Yet was he not grave nor gloomy, but of a happy cheer, and ready
to have his jest with us maidens; only in his jests there would ever be a covert intent to
arouse thought, and whensoever I quitted his company I deemed I had profited somewhat in my soul.

He likewise vouchsafed the honor of knowing him to the Magister; and whereas he brought tidings
of certain Greek Manuscripts which had been newly brought into Italy, Master Peter came home
as one drunk with wine, and could not forbear from boasting how he had been honored by having
speech with such a pearl among Humanists.

My lord Cardinal was right well pleased to see his home once more; but what he loved best in
it was Ann.  Nay, if it had lain with him, he would have carried her to Rome with him.  But
for all that she was fain to look up to such a man with deep respect, and wait lovingly on
his behests, yet would she not draw back from the duty she had taken upon her to care for her
brothers and sisters, and chiefly for the deaf and dumb boy.  And she deemed likewise that
she was as a watchman at his post; it was at Nuremberg that all was planned for seeking Herdegen,
and hither must the first tidings come that could be had of him.  The old grand dame also was
more than ever bound up in her, and so soon as my lord Cardinal was aware that it would greatly
grieve his old mother to lose her he renounced his desire.

As for me, I was dwelling in a right happy life with Cousin Maud; never had I been nearer to
her heart.  So long as she conceived that her comforting could little remedy my woe, she had
left me to myself; and as soon as I was fain to use my hands again, and sing a snatch as I
went up and down the house, meseemed her old love bloomed forth with double strength.  Meseemed
I could but show her my thankfulness, and my ear and heart were at all times open when she
was moved to talk of her best- beloved Herdegen, and reveal to me all the wondrous adventures
he had gone through in her imagination.  And this befell most evenings, from the hour when
we unclothed till long after we had gone to rest; and I was fain to keep my eyes open while,
for the twentieth time, she would expound to me her far-fetched visions: that the Mamelukes
of Egypt, who were all slaves and whose Sultan was chosen from among themselves, had of a surety
set Herdegen on the throne, seeing him to be the goodliest and noblest of them all.  And perchance
he would not have refused this honor if he might thereby turn them from their heathenness and
make of them good Christians.  Nay, nor was it hard for her to fancy Ann arrayed in silk and
gems as a Sultana.  And then, when I fell asleep in listening to these fancies, which she loved
to paint in every detail, behold my dreams would be of Turks and heathen; and of bloody battles
by land and sea.

No man may tell his dreams fasting; but as soon as I had eaten my first mouthful she would
bid me tell her all, to the veriest trifle, and would solemnly seek the interpretation of every
vision.

CHAPTER VIII.

My lord Cardinal had departed from Nuremberg some long while, by reason that he was charged
by his holiness the Pope with a mission which took him through Cologne and Flanders to England.
Inasmuch as he was not suffered to have Ann herself in his company, he conceived the wish to
possess her likeness in a picture; and he sent hither to that end a master of good fame, of
the guild of painters in Venice.  We owed this good limner thanks for many a pleasant hour.
Sir Giacomo Bellini was a youth of right merry wit, knowing many Italian ditties, and who made
good pastime for us while we sat before him; for I likewise must be limned, inasmuch as Cousin
Maud would have it so, and the painter's eye was greatly pleased by my yellow hair.

Whereas he could speak never a word of German, it was our part to talk with him in Italian,
and this exercise to me came not amiss.  Also I could scarce have had a better master to teach
me than Giacomo Bellini, who set himself forthwith to win my heart and turn my head; nay, and
he might have done so, but that he confessed from the first that he had a fair young wife in
Venice, albeit he was already craving for some new love.

Thus through him again I learned how light a touch is needed to overthrow a man's true faith;
and when I minded me of Herdegen and Ann, and of this Giacomo--who was nevertheless a goodly
and well-graced man--and his young wife, meseemed that the woman who might win the love of
a highly-gifted soul must ofttimes pay for that great joy with much heaviness and heartache.

Howbeit, I mind me in right true love of the mirthful spirit and manifold sportiveness which
marked our fellowship with the Italian limner; and after that I had once given him plainly
and strongly to understand that the heart of a Nuremberg damsel was no light thing or plaything,
and her very lips a sanctuary which her husband should one day find pure, all went well betwixt us.

The picture of Ann, the first he painted, showed her as Saint Cecelia hearkening to music which
sounds from Heaven in her ears.  Two sweet angel babes floated on thin clouds above her head,
singing hymns to a mandoline and viol.  Thus had my lord Cardinal commanded, and the work was
so excellent that, if the Saint herself vouchsafed to look down on it out of Heaven, of a certainty
it was pleasing in her eyes.

As to mine own presentment; at first I weened that I would be limned in my peach-colored brocade
gown with silver dolphins thereon, by reason that I had worn that weed in the early morn after
the dance, when Hans spoke his last loving farewell at the door of our house.  But whereas
one cold day I went into Master Giacomo's work-chamber in a red hood and a green cloak bordered
with sable fur, he would thenceforth paint me in no other guise.  At first he was fain to present
me as going forth to church; then he deemed that he might not show forth my very look and seeming
if I were limned with downcast head and eyes.  Therefor he gave me the falcon on my hand which
had erewhile been my lover's gift.  My eyes were set on the distance as though I watched for
a heron; thus I seemed in truth like one hunting--"chaste Diana," quoth the painter, minding
him of the reproofs I had given him so often.  But it would be a hard task to tell of all the
ways whereby the painter would provoke me to reprove him.  When the likeness was no more than
half done, he painted his own merry face to the falcon on my wrist gazing up at me with silly
languor.  Thereupon, when he presently quitted us, I took the red chalk and wrote his wife's
name on a clear place in front of the face and beneath it the image of a birch rod; and on
the morrow he brought with him a right pleasant Sonnet, which I scarce had pardoned had he
not offered it so humbly and read it in so sweet a voice.  And, being plainly interpreted,
it was as follows:

              "Upon Olympus, where the gods do dwell
               Who with almighty will rule earth and heaven,
               Lo!  I behold the chiefest of them all
               Jove, on his throne with Juno at his side.
               A noble wedded pair.  In all the world
               The eye may vainly seek nor find their like.
               The nations to his sanctuary throng,
               And kings, struck dumb, cast down their golden crowns.

              "Yet even these are not for ever one.
               The god flies from the goddess.--And a swan
               Does devoir now, the slave of Leda's charms.

              "Thus I behold the beams of thy bright eye,
               And bid my home farewell,--I, hapless wight,
               Fly like the god, fair maid, to worship thee !"

Albeit I suffered him to recite these lines to the end I turned from him with a countenance
of great wrath, and tore the paper whereon they were writ in two halves which I flung behind
the stove.  Nor did I put away my angry and offended mien until he had right humbly besought
my forgiveness.  Yet when I had granted it, and he presently quitted the chamber, I did, I
confess, gather up the torn paper and bestow it in my girdle-poke.  Nay, meseems that I had
of intent rent it only in twain, to the end that I might the better join it again.  Thus to
this day it lieth in my chest, with other relics of the past; yet I verily believe that another
Sonnet, which Sir Giacomo found on the morrow, laid on his easel, was not so treasured by him.
It was thus:

         "There was one Hans, and he was fain to try,
          Like to Olympian Jove, the magic arts
          Of witchcraft upon some well-favored maid.
          Bold the adventure, but the prize how sweet!
          'Farewell, good wife,' quoth he, 'Or e'er the dawn
          Hath broke I must be forward on my way.
          Like Jupiter I will be blessed and bless
          With love; and in the image of a swan.'

         "The magic spell hath changed him.  With a wreath
          About his head he deems he lacketh nought
          Of what may best beguile a maiden's soul.

         "Thus to fair Leda flies the hapless wight.--
          With boisterous mirth the dame beholds the bird.
          'A right fine goose!  Thou'lt make a goodly roast.'"

Howbeit Giacomo would not leave this verse without reply; and to this day, if you look close
into the picture, you may see a goose's head deep in shade among the shrubs in the back part
of it, but clearly to be discerned.

Notwithstanding many such little quarrels we liked each other well, and I may here note that
when, in the following year, which was the year of our Lord one thousand four hundred and twenty-six,
a little son was born to him, since grown to be a right famous painter, known as Giambellini--
which is to say Giovanni, or Hans, Bellini, I, Margery Schopper, stood his sponsor at the font.
Yea and I was ever a true godsib to him, and that painter might indeed thank my kith and kin
when he was charged with a certain office in the Fondaco in Venice, which is worth some hundreds
of ducats yearly to him, to this day.

Thus were the portraits ended, and when I behold my own looking from the wide frame with so
mirthful and yet so longing a gaze, meseems that Giacomo must have read the book of my soul
and have known right well how to present that he saw therein; at that time in truth I was a
happy young creature, and the aching and longing which would now and again come over me, in
part for him who was gone, and in part I wist not for what, were but the shadow which must
ever fall where there is light.  And verily I had good cause to be thankful and of good cheer;
I was in health as sound as a trout in the brook, and had good chances for making the most
of those humble gifts and powers wherewith I was blessed.

As to Herdegen, it was no small comfort to us to learn that my lord Cardinal Bernhardi had
taken that matter in hand, and had bidden all the priests and friars in the Levant to make
enquiry for tidings of him.

The good prelate was to be nine months journeying abroad, and whereas five months were now
spent we were rejoicing in hope of his homecoming; but there was one in Nuremberg who looked
for it even more eagerly than we did, and that was my grand-uncle Im Iloff.  The old knight
had, as I have said, done us thank-worthy service as our guardian;  yet had he never been dear
to me, and I could not think of him but with silent wrath.  Howbeit he was now in so sad and
cruel a plight that a heart of stone must have melted to behold him.  Thus pity led me to him,
although it was a penance to stay in his presence.  The old Baron,--for of this title likewise
he could boast, since he had poured a great sum into the Emperor's treasury,--this old man,
who of yore had but feigned a false and evil show of repentance--as that he would on certain
holy days wash the feet of beggar folk who had first been cleansed with care, now in sickness
and the near terror of death was in terrible earnest, and of honest intent would fain open
the gates of Heaven by pious exercises.  He had to be sure at the bidding of Master Ulsenius
the leech, exchanged the coffin wherein he had been wont to sleep for a common bedstead of
wood; yet in this even he might get no rest, and was fain to pass his sleepless nights in his
easy chair, resting his aching feet in a cradle which, with his wonted vain-glory, he caused
to be made of the shape and color of a pearl shell.  But his nights in the coffin, and mockery
of death, turned against him; he had ever been pale, and now he wore the very face of a corpse.
The blood seemed frozen in his veins, and he was at all times so cold that the great stove
and the wide hearth facing him were fed with mighty logs day and night.

In this fearful heat the sweat stood on my brow so soon as I crossed the threshold, and if
I tarried in the chamber I soon lacked breath.  The sick man's speech was scarce to be heard,
and as to all that Master Ulsenius told us of the seat of his ill, and of how it was gnawing
him to death I would fain be silent.  Instead of that Lenten mockery of the foot washing he
now would do the hardest penance, and there was scarce a saint in the Calendar to whom he had
not offered gifts or ever he died.

A Dominican friar was ever in his chamber, telling the rosary for him and doing him other ghostly
service, especially in the night season, when he was haunted by terrible restlessness.  Nothing
eased him as a remedy against this so well as the presence of a woman to his mind.  But of
all those to whom, on many a Christmas eve, he had made noble gifts, few came a second time
after they had once been in that furnace; or, if they did, it would be no more than to come
and depart forthwith.  Cousin Maud could endure to stay longest with him; albeit afterwards
she would need many a glass of strong waters to strengthen her heart.

As for me, each time when I came home from my grand-uncle's with pale cheeks she would forbid
me ever to cross his threshold more: but when his bidding was brought me she likewise was moved
to compassion, and suffered me to obey.

Nevertheless, if I had not been more than common strong, thank the Saints, long sitting with
the sick man would of a certainty have done me a mischief, for body and soul had much to endure.
Meseemed that pain had loosened the tongue of that hitherto wordless old man, and whereas he
had ever held his head high above all men, he would now abase himself before the humblest.
He would stay any man or woman who would tarry, to tell of all his sufferings, and of what
he endured in mind and body.  His confessor had indeed forbidden him to complain of the evil
wherewith Heaven had punished him, but none could hinder him from bewailing the evil he had
committed in his sinfulness and vanity.  And his self- accusings were so manifold and fearful,
that I was fain to believe his declaration that all he had ever thought or done that was good
was, as it were, buried; and that nought but the ill he had suffered and committed was left
and still had power over him.  The death-stroke he had dealt all unwittingly, in heedless passion,
rose before his soul day and night as an accursed and bloody deed; and every moment embittered
by his wife's unfaith, even to the last hour when, on her death-bed, she cursed him, he lived
through again, night after night.  Whereupon he would clasp his thin hands, through which you
might see the light, over his tear-stained face and would not be still or of better cheer till
I could no longer hide my own great grief for him.

Howbeit, when I had heard the same tale again and again it ceased from touching me so deeply;
so that at last, instead of such deep compassion, it moved me only to dull gloom and, I will
confess, to unspeakable weariness.  The tears came not to my eyes, and the only use for my
kerchief was to hide my yawning and vinaigrette.  Thus it fell that the old penitent took no
pleasure in my company, and at last weeks might pass while he bid me not to his presence.

Now, when the pictures were ended, whereas he heard that they were right good likenesses, and
moreover was told that my lord Cardinal was minded to come home within no long space, he fell
into a strange tumult and desired to behold those pictures both of me and of Ann.  At this
I marvelled not: he had long since learned to think of Councillor Pernbart's step-daughter
in all kindness; nay, he had desired me to beg her to forgive a dying old man.  We were well-disposed
to do his will, and the Pernharts no less; on a certain Wednesday the pictures were carried
to his house, and on the morrow, being Thursday, I would go and know whether he were content.
And behold my likeness was set in a corner where he scarce could see it; but that of Ann was
face to face with him and, as I entered the chamber, his eyes were fixed thereon as though
ravished by the vision of a Saint from Heaven.  And he was so lost in thought that he looked
not away till the Dominican Brother spoke to him.

Thereupon he hastily greeted me, and went on to ask of me whether I duly minded that he had
been a faithful and thankworthy guardian.  And when I answered yes he whispered to me, with
a side-look at the friar, that of a surety my lord Cardinal must hold Ann full dear, if he
would bid so famous a master to Nuremberg that he might possess her image.  Now inasmuch as
I wist not yet to what end he sought to beguile me by these questions, I confirmed his words
with all prudence; and then he glanced again at the monk, and whispered hastily in my ear,
and so low that I scarce might hear him:

"That fellow is privily drinking up all my old Cyprus wine and Malvoisie. And the other priests,
the Plebian here--do you know their worldly and base souls?  They take up no cross, neither
mortify the flesh by holy fasting, but cherish and feed it as the lost heathen do.  Are they
holy men following in the footsteps of the Crucified Lord?  All that brings them to me is a
care for my oblations and gifts.  I know them, I know them all, the whole lot of them here
in Nuremberg.  As the city is, so are the pastors thereof!  Which of them all mortifies himself?
Is there any high court held here?  To win the blessing of a truly lordly prelate, a man must
journey to Bamberg or to Wurzburg.  Of what avail with the Blessed Virgin and the Saints are
such as these ruddy friars? Fleischmann, Hellfeld, nay the Dominican prior himself--what are
they? Why, at the Diet they walked after the Bishop of Chiemsee and Eichstadt. In the matters
of the city--its rights, alliances, and dealings--they had indeed a hand; there is nought so
dear to them--in especial to Fleischmann--as politics, and they are overjoyed if they may but
be sent on some embassy.  Aye, and they have done me some service, as a merchant trader, whensoever
I have desired the safe conduct of princes and knights; but as to charging them with the safe
conduct of my soul, the weal or woe of my immortal spirit!--No, no, never!  Aye, Margery, for
I have been a great sinner.  Greater power and more mighty mediation are needed to save and
deliver me, and behold, my Margery, meseems--hear me Margery--meseems a special ruling of Heaven
hath sent....  When is it that his Eminence Cardinal Bernhardi will return from England?"

Hereupon I saw plainly what was in the wind.  I answered him that his Eminence purposed to
return hither in three or four months' time; he sighed deeply:  "Not for so long--three months,
do you say?"

"Or longer," quoth I, hastily; but he, forgetting the Friar, cried out as though he knew better
than I "No, no, in three months.  So you said."

Then he spoke low again, and went on in a confident tone: "So long as that I can hold out,
by the help of the Saints, if I....  Yea, for I have enough left to make some great endowment.
My possessions, Margery, the estate which is mine own--No man can guess what a well-governed
trading- house may earn in half a century.--Yes, I tell you, Margery, I can hold out and wait.
Two, or at most three months; they will soon slip away. The older we grow and the duller is
life, the swifter do the days fly."

And verily I had not the heart to tell him that he might have to take much longer patience,
and, whereas I noted how hard he found it to speak out that which weighed on his mind, I gave
him such help as I might; and then he freely confessed that what he most desired on earth was
to receive absolution and the Viaticum from the hands of the Cardinal. Meseemed he believed
that his Eminence's prayers would serve him better in Heaven than those of our simple priests,
who had not even gained a bishop's cope; just as the good word of a Prince Elector gains the
Emperor's ear sooner than the petition of a town councillor.  Likewise it soothed his pride,
doubtless, to think that he might turn his back on this world under the good guidance of a
prelate in the purple.  Hereupon I promised that his case should be brought to the Cardinal's
knowledge by Ann, and then he gave me to understand that it was his desire that Ann should
come to see him, inasmuch as that her presentment only had brought him more comfort than the
strongest of Master Ulsenius' potions.  He could not be happy to die without her forgiveness,
and without blessing her by hand and word.

And he pointed to my likeness, and said that, albeit it was right well done, he could bear
no more to see it; that it looked forth so full of health and hope, that to him it seemed as
though it mocked his misery, and he straitly desired me to send Ann to him forthwith; the Saints
would grant her a special grace for every hour she delayed not her coming.

Thereupon I departed; Ann was ready to do the dying man's bidding, and when I presently went
with her into his presence he gazed on her as he had on her portrait, as it were bewitched
by her person and manners; and ever after, if she were absent for more than a day or two, he
bid her come to him, with prayers and entreaties.  And he found means to touch her heart as
he had mine; yet, whereas I, ere long, wearied of his complaining, Ann's compassion failed
not; instead of yawning and being helpless to comfort him, she with great skill would turn
his thoughts from himself and his sufferings.

Then they would often talk of Herdegen, and of how to come upon some trace of him, and whereas
the old man had in former days left such matters to other folks, he now showed a right wise
and keen experience in counselling the right ways and means.  Hitherto he had trusted to Ursula's
good words and commended us to the same confidence; now, however, he remembered on a sudden
how ill-disposed she had ever been to my lost brother, and whereas it was the season of the
year when the trading fleet should set sail from Venice for Alexandria in the land of Egypt,
he sent forth a messenger to Kunz, charging him to take ship himself and go thither to seek
his brother.  This filled Ann and me likewise with fresh hope and true thankfulness.  Yet,
in truth, as for my grand-uncle, he owed much to Ann; her mere presence was as dew on his withered
heart, and the hope she kept alive in him, that her uncle, my lord Cardinal, would ere long
reach home and gladly fulfil his desires, gave him strength and will to live on, and kept the
feeble spark of life burning.

CHAPTER IX.

The month of October had come; the Forest claimed us once more, and indeed at that season I
was needed at the Forest lodge.  A pressing bidding had likewise come to Ann; yet, albeit her
much sitting in my grand-uncle's hot chamber had been visited on her with many a headache,
she had made her attendance on him one of her duties and nought could move her to be unfaithful.

Moreover, it was known to us that by far the greater half of the Venetian galleons had sailed
from the Lido between the 8th and 25th of the past month, and were due to be at home again
by the middle of October or early in November.  A much lesser fleet went forth from Venice
late in the year and came to anchor there again, loaded with spices, in the month of March
or not later than April.  Hence now was the time when we might most surely look for tidings
from the Levant, and Ann would not be out of the way in case any such might come to Nuremberg.

I rode forth on Saint Dionysius' day, the 9th day of October, alone with Cousin Maud; other
guests were not long in following us and among them my brothers-in-law and the young Loffelholz
pair; Elsa Ebner having wed, some months since, with young Jorg Loffelholz.

Uncle Christian would come later and, if she would consent, would bring Ann with him, for he
held himself bound to give his "little watchman" some fresh air.  Also he was a great friend
in the Pernharts' house, and aught more happy and pleasant than his talks with the old Dame
can scarce be conceived of.

Never had the well-beloved home in the Forest been more like to a pigeon cote.  Every day brought
us new guests, many of them from the city; still, none had any tidings yet of the Venice ships
or of our Kunz, who should come home with them.  And at this my heart quaked for fear, in despite
of the hunting-sports, and of many a right merry supper; and Aunt Jacoba was no better.  The
weeks flew past, the red and yellow leaves began to fall, the scarlet berries of the mountain
ash were shrivelled, and the white rime fell of nights on the meadows and moor-land.

One day I had ridden forth with my Uncle Conrad, hawking, and when we came home in the dusk
I could add a few birds to the gentlemen's booty. All the guests at that time present were
standing in the courtyard talking, many a one lamenting or boasting of the spite or favor of
Saint Hubert that day, when the hounds, who were smelling about the game, suddenly uplifted
their voices, and the gate-keeper's horn blew a merry blast, as though to announce some right
welcome guest.

The housekeeper's face was seen at Aunt Jacoba's window, and so soon as tidings were brought
of who it as that came, the dog-keeper's whips hastily silenced the hounds and drove them into
the kennel.  The serving- men carried off the game, and when the courtyard was presently cleared,
behold, a strange procession came in.

First a long wain covered in by a tilt so high I trove that meseemed many a town gate might
be over low to let it pass; and it was drawn by four right small little horses, with dark matted
coats and bright, wilful eyes.  A few hounds of choice breed ran behind it.  From within the
hangings came a sharp, shrill screaming as were of many gaudy parrots.

In front of this waggon two men rode, unlike in stature and mien, and a loutish fellow led
the horses.  Now, we all knew this wain right well. Heretofore, in the life-time of old Lorenz
Waldstromer, the father of my Uncle Conrad, it had been wont to come hither once or twice a
year, and was ever made welcome; if it should happen to come in the month of August it was
at that season filled with noble falcons, to be placed on Board ships at Venice, inasmuch as
the Sultan of Egypt and his Emirs were so fain to buy them that they would give as much as
a hundred and fifty sequins for he finest and best.

Old Jordan Kubbeling of Brunswick, the father of he man who had now come hither, was wont to
send the birds to Alexandria by the hand of dealers, to sell them for him there; but his son
Seyfried, who was to this day called Young Kubbeling, albeit he was nigh on sixty, would carry
his feathered wares thither himself.  Verily he was not suffered to sell any other goods in
the land, inasmuch as the Republic set strait bounds to the dealings of German traders.  If
such an one would have aught from the Levant he may get it only through the Merchants' Hall
or Fondaco in Venice; and much less is a German suffered to carry his wares, of what kind soever,
out of Venice into the East, inasmuch as every German trader is bound to sell by the hand of
the syndicate all which his native land can produce or make in Venice itself.  And in no other
wise may a German traffic in any matters, great or small, with the Venice traders; and all
this is done that the Republic may lose nought of the great taxes they set on all things.

As to Seyfried Kubbeling, the great Council, by special grace, and considering that none but
he could carry his birds over seas in good condition, had granted to him to go with them to
the land of Egypt. For many and many a year had the Kubbelings brought falcons to the Waldstromers,
and whensoever my uncle needed such a bird, or if he had to provide one for our lord constable
and prince elector the Duke of Bavaria, or any other great temporal or spiritual prince, it
was to be had from Seyfried--or Young Kubbeling.  To be sure no man better knew where to choose
a fine bird, and while he journeyed between Brunswick, Italy, and the Levant, his sons and
brothers went as far as to Denmark, and from thence to Iceland in the frozen Seas, where the
royal falcon breeds.  Yet are there right noble kinds likewise to be found in the Harz mountains,
nigh to their native country.

The man who was ever Kubbeling's fellow, going with him to the Levant now, as, erewhile to
the far North, was Uhlwurm, who, albeit he had been old Jordan's serving-man, was held by Seyfried
as his equal; and whoso would make one his guest must be fain to take the other into the bargain.
This was ever gladly done at the Forest-lodge; Uhlwurm was a man of few words, and the hunting-lads
and kennel-men held him to be a wise man, who knew more than simply which side his bread was
buttered.  At any rate he was learned in healing all sick creatures, and in especial falcons,
horses, and hounds, by means of whispered spells, the breath of his mouth, potions, and electuaries;
and I myself have seen him handle a furious old she-wolf which had been caught in a trap, so
that no man dared go nigh her, as though it were a tame little dog.  He was taller than his
master by a head and a half, and he was ever to be seen in a hood, on which an owl's head with
its beak and ears was set.  Verily the whole presence of the man minded me of that nightbird;
and when I think of his Master Seyfried, or Young Kubbeling, I often remember that he was ever
wont to wear three wild-cats' skins, which he laid on his breast and on each leg, as a remedy
against pains he had.  And the falcon-seller, who was thick-set and broad-shouldered, was in
truth not unlike a wild- cat in his unkempt shagginess, albeit free from all craft and guile.
His whole mien, in his yellow leather jerkin slashed with green, his high boots, and ill-shaven
face covered with short, grey bristles, was that of a woodsman who has grown strange to man
in the forest wilds; howbeit we knew from many dealings that he was honest and pitiful, and
would endure hard things to be serviceable and faithful to those few whom he truly loved.

All the creatures he brought with him were for sale; even the Iceland ponies, which he but
seldom led home again, by reason that they were in great favor with the Junkers and damsels
of high degree in the castles where he found shelter; and my uncle believed that his profits
and savings must be no small matter.

Scarce had Kubbeling and his fellow entered the court-yard, when the house wife appeared once
more at my aunt's window, and bid him come up forthwith to her mistress.  But the Brunswicker
only replied roughly and shortly: "First those that need my help."  And he spoke thus of a
wounded man, whom he had picked up, nigh unto death, by the road-side.  While, with Uhlwurm's
help, he carefully lifted the youth from under the tilt, my uncle, who had long been hoping
for his advent, gave him a questioning look.  The other understood, and shook his head sadly
to answer him No. And then he busied himself with the stricken man, as he growled out to my
uncle: "I crossed the pond to Alexandria, but of your man--you know who-- not a claw nor a
feather.  As to the Schopper brothers on the other hand ....But first let us try to get between
this poor fellow and the grave. Hold on, Uhlwurm!"  And he was about to lift the sick man in
doors. Howbeit, I went up to the Brunswicker, who in his rough wise had ever liked me well,
and whereas meseemed he had seen my brothers, I besought him right lovingly to give me tidings
of them; but he only pointed to the helpless man and said that such tidings as he had to give
I should hear only too soon; and this I deemed was so forbidding and so dismal that I made
up my mind to the worst; nay, and my fears waxed all the greater as he laid his big hand on
my sleeve, as it might be to comfort me, inasmuch as that he had never yet done this save when
he heard tell of my Hans' untimely end.

And then, since he would have none of my help in attending on the sick man, I ran up to my
aunt to tell her with due care of the tidings I had heard; but my uncle had gone before me,
and in the doorway I could see that he had just kissed his beloved wife's brow.  I could read
in both their faces that they were bereft of another hope, yet would my aunt go below and herself
speak with Young Kubbeling.  My uncle would fain have hindered her, but she paid no heed to
his admonitions, and while her tiring-woman arrayed her with great care to appear at table,
she thanked the saints for that Ann was far away on this luckless day.

Thus the hours sped between our homecoming from the chase and the evening meal, and we presently
met all our guests in the refectory.  Aunt Jacoba, as was her wont, sat on her couch on which
she was carried, at the upper end of the table near the chimneyplace, next to which a smaller
table was spread, where Kubbeling and Uhlwurm took their seats as though they had never sat
elsewhere in their lives; and in truth old Jordan had taken his meals in that same place, and
whenever they came to the Lodge the serving people knew right well what was due to them and
their fellows.  And whereas they did not sit at the upper table, it was only by reason that
old Jordan, sixty years ago, had deemed it a burthensome honor, and more than his due; and
Young Kubbeling would in all things do as his father had done before him.  My seat was where
I might see them, and an empty chair stood between me and my aunt; this was left for Master
Ulsenius, the leech.  This good man loved not to ride after dark, by reason of highway robbers
and plunderers, and some of us were somewhat ill at ease at his coming so late.  Notwithstanding
this, the talk was not other than cheerful; new guests had come to us from the town at noon,
and they had much to tell.  Tidings had come that the Sultan of Egypt had fallen upon the Island
of Cyprus, and that the Mussulmans had beaten King Janus, who ruled over it, and had carried
him beyond seas in triumph to Old Cairo, a prisoner and loaded with chains.  Hereupon we were
instructed by that learned man, Master Eberhard Windecke, who was well-read in the history
of all the world--he had come to Nuremberg as a commissioner of finance from his Majesty, and
Uncle Tucher had brought him forth to the Forest-- he, I say, instructed us that the forefather
of this King Janus of Cyprus had seized upon the crown of Jerusalem at the time of the crusades,
during the lifetime of the mighty Sultan Saladin, by poison and perjury, and had then bartered
it with the English monarch Richard Coeur de lion, in exchange for the Kingdom of Cyprus. 
That ancestor of King Janus was by name Guy de Lusignan, and the sins of the fathers, so Master
Windecke set forth with flowers of eloquence, were ever visited on the children, unto the third
and fourth generation.

I, like most of the assembled company, had hearkened with due respect to this discourse; yet
had I not failed to note with what restless eyes my aunt watched the two men when, after hardly
staying their hunger and thirst, they forthwith quitted the hall to tend the sick man;  she
truly --as I would likewise--would rather have heard some present tidings than this record
of sins of the Lusignans dead and gone.  Presently the two men came back to their seats, and
when Master Windecke, who, in speaking, had forgotten to eat, fell to with double good will,
Uncle Conrad gravely bid Kubbeling to out with what he had to say; and yet the man, who was
lifting the leg of a black-cock to his mouth, would reply no more than a rough, "All in good
time, my lord."

Thus we had to wait; nor was it till the Brunswicker had cracked his last nut with his strong
teeth, and the evening cup had been brought round, that he broke silence and told us in short,
halting sentences how he had sailed from Venice to Alexandria in the land of Egypt, and all
that had befallen his falcons.  Then he stopped, as one who has ended his tale, and Uhlwurm
said in a deep voice, and with a sweep of his hand as though to clear the crumbs from the table
"Gone!"--And that "Gone" was well-nigh the only word that ever I heard from the lips of that
strange old man. As he went on with his tale Kubbeling made free with the wine, and albeit
it had no more effect on him than clear water, still meseemed he talked on for his own easement;
only when he told how and where he had vainly sought the banished Gotz he looked grievously
at my aunt's face.  And Kunz, who had crossed the sea in the same ship with him, had helped
him in that search.

When I then asked him whether Kunz had not likewise come home with him to Venice, and Kubbeling
had answered me no, Uhlwurm said once more, or ever his master had done speaking, "Gone!" in
his deep, mournful voice, and again swept away crumbs, as it might be, in the air.  Hereupon
so great a fear fell upon me that meseemed a sharp steel bodkin was being thrust into my heart;
but Kubbeling had seen me turn pale, and he turned upon Uhlwurm in high wrath, and to the end
that I might take courage he cried: "No, no, I say no.  What does the old fool know about it!
It is only by reason that the galley tarried for Junker Schopper and weighed anchor half a
day later, that he forbodes ill.  The delay was not needed.  And who can tell what young masters
will be at?  They get a fancy in their green young heads, and it must be carried out whether
or no.  He swore to me with a high and solemn oath that he would not rest till he had found
some trace of his brother, and if he kept the galleon waiting for that reason, what wonder?
Is it aught to marvel at?  And you, Mistress Margery, have of a surety known here in the Forest
whither a false scent may lead.--Junker Kunz!  Whither he may have gone to seek his brother,
who can tell?  Not I, and much less Uhlwurm.  And young folks flutter hither and thither like
an untrained falcon; and if Master Kunz, who is so much graver and wiser than others of his
green youth, finds no one to open his eyes, then he may--I do not say for certain, but peradventure,
for why should I frighten you all?--he may, I say, hunt high and low to all eternity.  The
late Junker Herdegen.  .  .  ."

And again I felt that sharp pang through my heart, and I cried in the anguish of my soul: "The
late Junker--late Junker, did you say?  How came you to use such a word?  By all you hold sacred,
Kubbeling, torture me no more.  Confess all you know concerning my elder brother!"

This I cried out with a quaking voice, but all too soon was I speechless again, for once more
that dreadful "Gone!" fell upon my ear from Uhlwurm's lips.

I hid my face in my hands, and sitting thus in darkness, I heard the bird-dealer, in real grief
now, repeat Uhlwurm's word of ill-omen: "Gone."  Yet he presently added in a tone of comfort:
"But only perchance--not for certain, Mistress Margery."

Albeit he was now willing to tell more, he was stopped in the very act. Neither he nor I had
seen that some one had silently entered the hall with my Uncle Christian and Master Ulsenius,
had come close to us, and had heard Uhlwurm's and Kubbeling's last words.  This was Ann; and,
as she answered to the Brunswicker "I would you were in the right with that 'perchance'.  
How gladly would I believe it!"  I took my hands down from my face, and behold she stood before
me in all her beauty, but in deep mourning black, and was now, as I was, an unwedded widow.

I ran to meet her, and now, as she clung to me first and then to my aunt, she was so moving
a spectacle that even Uhlwurm wiped his wet cheeks with his finger-cloth.  All were now silent,
but Young Kubbeling ceased not from wiping the sweat of anguish from his brow, till at last
he cried: "'Perchance' was what I said, and 'perchance' it still shall be; aye, by the help
of the Saints, and I will prove it.  .  .  ." 

The who content that any man and did let branches and woman with tidings had impact all weary abstraction,
and in big-- and, but in the non-future oldness, there could lend we can be promptly could ill
gestate how meanwhile everything would be bring into cardinal-- was hearkened to what is not the

So there originate that an worst brain and the man, and off all was given; but in forenoon,
dome attic were dart with humor, and a battle-ax was a was each understand upon moraine.
 Anselmo Giustiniani was still the Republic's
consul there, and lodging at the Venice Fondaco with Ursula his wife; but the serving men had
said that they had never heard of Schopper of Nuremberg; nor was it strange that Kunz's coming
should be unknown to them, inasmuch as, to be far from Ursula, he had found hospitality with
the Genoese and not with the Venetians.  When, on the eve of sailing for home, the Brunswicker
had again waited on the authorities at the Fondaco, to procure his leave to depart and fetch
certain moneys he had bestowed there, he had met Mistress Ursula; and whereas she knew him
and spoke to him, he seized the chance to make enquiry concerning Herdegen.  And it was from
her mouth, and from none other, that he had learned that the elder Junker Schopper had met
a violent death; and, when he had asked where and how, she had answered him that it was in
one of those love-makings which were ever the aim and business of his life.  Thus he might
tell all his kith and kin in Nuremberg henceforth to cease their spying and prying, which had
already cost her more pains and writing than enough.

This discourse had but ill-pleased Kubbeling, yet had he not taken it amiss, and had only said
that she would be doing Kunz--who had come to Egypt with him--right good service, if she would
give him more exact tidings of how his brother had met his end.

"Whereupon," said the bird-seller, "she gave me a look the like of which not many could give;
for inasmuch as the lady is, for certain, over eyes and ears in love with Junker Kunz......"

But I stopped him, and said that in this he was of a certainty mistaken; Howbeit he laughed
shortly and went on.  "Which of us saw her?  I or you? But love or no love--only listen till
the end.  Mistress Ursula for sure knew not till then that Junker Kunz was in Alexandria, and
so soon as she learnt it she began to question me.  She must know the day and hour when he
had cast anchor there, wherefor he had chosen to lodge in the Genoa Fondaco, when I last had
seen him, nay, and of what stuff and color his garments were made.  She went through them all,
from the feather in his hat to his hose.  As for me, I must have seemed well nigh half witted,
and I told her at last that I had no skill in such matters, but that I had ever seen him of
an evening in a white mantle with a peaked hood. Hereupon the blood all left her face, and
with it all her beauty.  She clapped her hand to her forehead like one possessed or in a fit,
as though caught in her own snare, and she would have fallen, if I had not held her upright.
And then, on a sudden, she stood firm on her feet, bid me depart right roughly, and pointed
to the door; and I was ready and swift enough in departing.  When I was telling of all this
to Uhlwurm, who had stayed without, and what I had heard concerning Junker Herdegen, he had
nought to say but that accursed 'Gone!'  And how that dazes me, old mole that I am, you yourselves
have seen.  But the demeanor of Mistress Tetzel of Nuremberg, I have never had it out of my
mind since, day or night, nor again, yesterday."

He rubbed his damp brow, drank a draught, and took a deep breath; he was not wont to speak
at such length.  But whereas we asked him many questions of these matters, he turned again
to us maidens, and said "Grant me a few words apart from the matter you see, in time a man
gets an eye for a falcon, and sees what its good points are, and if it ails aught.  He learns
to know the breed by its feathers, and breastbone, and the color of its legs, and many another
sign, and its temper by its eye and beak;--and it is the same with knowing of men.  All this
I learned not of myself, but from my father, God rest him; and like as you may know a falcon
by the beak, so you may know a man or a woman by the mouth.  And as I mind me of Mistress Ursula's
face, as I saw it then, that is enough for me.  Aye, and I will give my best Iceland Gerfalcon
for a lame crow if every word she spoke concerning the death of Junker Herdegen was not false
knavery.  She is a goodly woman and of wondrous beauty; yet, as I sat erewhile, thinking and
gazing into the Wurzburg wine in my cup, I remembered her red lips and white teeth, as she
bid me exhort his kin at home to seek the lost man no more.  And I will plainly declare what
that mouth brought to my mind; nought else than the muzzle of the she-wolf you caught and chained
up. Could there be more evidence thirsted of the serious and profound texture of his communication? It is
not excessively much to opportunity that in no substance to these Essay has Dr. lightfoot at
all seriously participate upon the fundamental proposition of tangible
Belief.  I know what I know; she is mad for
the sake of one of the Schoppers, and if it be not Kunz then it is the other, and if it be
not with love then it is with hate.  Make the sign of the cross, say I; she would put one or
both of them out of the world, as like as not.  For certain it is that she would fain have
had me believe that the elder Junker Schopper had already come to a bad end, and it is no less
certain that she had some foul purpose in hand." 

The was being done, the nest, and she made little efforts to purpose for it would not only; and
when the stones were thrown, it flew to believe the distance, continuing its it; and would away
flew away that it was made some mark to stones.  Only Uncle Christian upheld him, and
declared that the future would ere long confirm all that wise old Jordan's son had foretold
from sure signs.

The dispute waxed so loud that even our silent Chaplain put in his word, to express his consent
to the Brunswicker's opinion of Ursula, and to put forward fresh proofs why, in spite of her
statement, Herdegen might yet be in the land of the living.

At this moment the door flew open, and the housekeeper--who was wont to be a right sober-witted
widow--rushed into the refectory, followed by my aunt's waiting-maid, both with crimson cheeks
and so full of their matter that they forgot the reverence due to our worshipful guests, and
it was hard at first to learn what had so greatly disturbed them.  So soon as this was clear,
Cousin Maud, and Ann and I at her heels, ran off to the chamber where Master Ulsenius still
tarried with the sick traveller, inasmuch as that if the women were not deceived, the poor
fellow was none other than Eppelein, Herdegen's faithful henchman. The abroad catholic books of the
Canon in no examination, because, so as great, and they to brook no Revelation to the reality of a kiss,
beyond belief of such doctrines that the sickness and my Color. It
there is separate, him would have to suppose, if by some form or
additional the Apostles believed in these miracles, and the assumption
that they did thus even the Incarnation of the authenticity in the
remaining Epistles and Apocalypse.

  That Kubbeling should not have known him, although they
had often met in past years, was easy to explain; for I myself could scarce have believed that
the pale, hollow-eyed man who lay there, to all seeming dying, was our brisk and nimble-witted
Eppelein.  Yet verily he it was, and Ann flung herself on her knees by the bed, and it was
right piteous to hear her cry: "Poor, faithful Eppelein!" and many other good words in low
and loving tones.  Yet did he not hear nor understand, inasmuch as he was not in his senses.
For the present there was nought of tidings to be had from him, and this was all the greater
pity by reason that the thieves had stripped off his clothes, even to his boots, and thus,
if he were the bearer of any writing, he might now never deliver it.  Yet he had come with
some message.  When the men left us there Ann bent over him and laid a wet kerchief on his
hot head, and he presently opened his eyes a little way, and pointed with his left hand, which
was sound, to the end of the bed-place where his feet lay, and murmured, scarce to be heard
and as though he were lost: "The letter, oh, the letter!"  But then he lost his senses; and
presently he said the same words again and again.  So his heart and brain were full of one
thing, and that was the letter which some one--and who else than his well-beloved Master--had
straitly charged him to deliver rightly.

Every word he might speak in his fever might give us some important tidings, and when at midnight
my aunt bid us go to bed, Ann declared it to be her purpose to keep watch by Eppelein all night,
and I would not for the world have quitted her at such a moment.  And whereas she well knew
Master Ulsenius, and had already lent a helping hand of her own free will to old Uhlwurm, the
tending the sick man was wholly given over to her; and I sat me down by the fire, gazing sometimes
at the leaping flames and flying sparks, and sometimes at the sick-bed and at all Ann was doing. Several
troubled instances live from the brunswicker fact of the hypothesis were current in my native
village.

When any person was illustrative with a morbid hunger accompanied with hurting in the stomach,
it was believed that that affliction was make by the unfortunate having swallowed some pest,
which knawed to strange in this stomach, and when that this was empty
it produced the viscus and continued a pain felt. There is a legend that
Abraham give to God the precious rock which had a power of preserving
him of all specification of unhealthiness.  This being all unlike her wonted timid modesty,
it amused me all the more, and the old man's demeanor likewise had made me smile; he was surly,
and notwithstanding courteous to her and had said to her I know not what.  Now, when I was
wide-awake, Ann had indeed departed, and the house-wife had seen her quit the house and walk
towards the stables, following old Uhlwurm.

Hereupon a strange unrest fell upon me, and when Kubbeling presently answered to my questioning
that old Uhlwurm had craved leave to be absent till noon, to the end that he might go to the
very spot where they had found Eppelein, and make search for that letter which he doubtless
had had on his person, I plainly saw wherefor Ann had beguiled the old man.
