DEDICATORY

Because he has given me permission to tell my story; because he has read that story and knows
I try to speak the truth; because I believe that he is fair-minded and will cause my people
to receive justice in the future; and because he is chief of a great people, I dedicate this
story of my life to Theodore Roosevelt, President of the United States.

GERONIMO.

PREFACE

The initial idea of the compilation of this work was to give the reading public an authentic
record of the private life of the Apache Indians, and to extend to Geronimo as a prisoner of
war the courtesy due any captive, i. e., the right to state the causes which impelled him in
his opposition to our civilization and laws.

If the Indians' cause has been properly presented, the captives' defense clearly stated, and
the general store of information regarding vanishing types increased, I shall be satisfied.

I desire to acknowledge valuable suggestions from Maj. Charles Taylor, Fort Sill, Oklahoma;
Dr. J. M. Greenwood, Kansas City, Missouri, and President David R. Boyd, of the University
of Oklahoma.

I especially desire in this connection to say that without the kindly advice and assistance
of President Theodore Roosevelt this book could not have been written.

Respectfully, S. M. BARRETT. LAWTON, OKLAHOMA. August 14, 1906.

INTRODUCTORY

I first met Geronimo in the summer of 1904, when I acted for him as interpreter of English
into Spanish, and vice versa, in selling a war bonnet. After that he always had a pleasant
word for me when we met, but never entered into a general conversation with me until he learned
that I had once been wounded by a Mexican. As soon as he was told of this, he came to see me
and expressed freely his opinion of the average Mexican, and his aversion to all Mexicans in
general.

I invited him to visit me again, which he did, and upon his invitation, I visited him at his
tepee in the Fort Sill Military reservation.

In the summer of 1905 Dr. J. M. Greenwood, superintendent of schools at Kansas City, Missouri,
visited me, and I took him to see the chief. Geronimo was quite formal and reserved until Dr.
Greenwood said, "I am a friend of General Howard, whom I have heard speak of you." "Come,"
said Geronimo, and led the way to a shade, had seats brought for us, put on his war bonnet,
and served watermelon à l'Apache (cut in big chunks), while he talked freely and cheerfully.
When we left he gave us a pressing invitation to visit him again.

In a few days the old chief came to see me and asked about "my father." I said "you mean the
old gentleman from Kansas City--he has returned to his home." "He is you father?" said Geronimo.
"No," I said, "my father died twenty-five years ago, Dr. Greenwood is only my friend." After
a moment's silence the old Indian spoke again, this time in a tone of voice intended to carry
conviction, or at least to allow no further discussion. "Your natural father is dead, this
man has been your friend and adviser from youth. By adoption he is your father. Tell him he
is welcome to come to my home at any time." It was of no use to explain any more, for the old
man had determined not to understand my relation to Dr. Greenwood except in accordance with
Indian customs, and I let the matter drop.

In the latter part of that summer I asked the old chief to allow me to publish some of the
things he had told me, but he objected, saying, however, that if I would pay him, and if the
officers in charge did not object, he would tell me the whole story of his life. I immediately
called at the fort (Fort Sill) and asked the officer in charge, Lieutenant Purington, for permission
to write the life of Geronimo. I was promptly informed that the privilege would not be granted.
Lieutenant Purington explained to me the many depredations committed by Geronimo and his warriors,
and the enormous cost of subduing the Apaches, adding that the old Apache deserved to be hanged
rather than spoiled by so much attention from civilians. A suggestion from me that our government
had paid many soldiers and officers to go to Arizona and kill Geronimo and the Apaches, and
that they did not seem to know how to do it, did not prove very gratifying to the pride of
the regular army officer, and I decided to seek elsewhere for permission. Accordingly I wrote
to President Roosevelt that here was an old Indian who had been held a prisoner of war for
twenty years and had never been given a chance to tell his side of the story, and asked that
Geronimo be granted permission to tell for publication, in his own way, the story of his life,
and that he be guaranteed that the publication of his story would not affect unfavorably the
Apache prisoners of war. By return mail I received word that the authority had been granted.
In a few days I received word from Fort Sill that the President had ordered the officer in
charge to grant permission as requested. An interview was requested that I might receive the
instructions of the War Department. When I went to Fort Sill the officer in command handed
me the following brief, which constituted my instructions:

LAWTON, OKLAHOMA, Aug. 12th, 1905. Geronimo,--Apache Chief-- S. M. BARRETT, Supt. Schools.

     Letter to the President stating that above-mentioned desires to
     tell his life story that it may be published, and requests

     Apache tribe.

Early in October I secured the services of an educated Indian, Asa Deklugie, son of Whoa, chief
of the Nedni Apaches, as interpreter, and the work of compiling the book began.

Geronimo refused to talk when a stenographer was present, or to wait for corrections or questions
when telling the story. Each day he had in mind what he would tell and told it in a very clear,
brief manner. He might prefer to talk at his own tepee, at Asa Deklugie's house, in some mountain
dell, or as he rode in a swinging gallop across the prairie; wherever his fancy led him, there
he told whatever he wished to tell and no more. On the day that he first gave any portion of
his autobiography he would not be questioned about any details, nor would he add another word,
but simply said, "Write what I have spoken," and left us to remember and write the story without
one bit of assistance. He would agree, however, to come on another day to my study, or any
place designated by me, and listen to the reproduction (in Apache) of what had been told, and
at such times would answer all questions or add information wherever he could be convinced
that it was necessary.

He soon became so tired of book making that he would have abandoned the task but for the fact
that he had agreed to tell the complete story. When he once gives his word, nothing will turn
him from fulfilling his promise. A very striking illustration of this was furnished by him
early in January, 1906. He had agreed to come to my study on a certain date, but at the appointed
hour the interpreter came alone, and said that Geronimo was very sick with cold and fever.
He had come to tell me that we must appoint another date, as he feared the old warrior had
an attack of pneumonia. It was a cold day and the interpreter drew a chair up to the grate
to warm himself after the exposure of the long ride. Just as he was seating himself he looked
out of the window, then rose quickly, and without speaking pointed to a rapidly moving object
coming our way. In a moment I recognized the old chief riding furiously (evidently trying to
arrive as soon as the interpreter did), his horse flecked with foam and reeling from exhaustion.
Dismounting he came in and said in a hoarse whisper, "I promised to come. I am here."

I explained to him that I had not expected him to come on such a stormy day, and that in his
physical condition he must not try to work. He stood for some time, and then without speaking
left the room, remounted his tired pony, and with bowed head faced ten long miles of cold north
wind--he had kept his promise.

When he had finished his story I submitted the manuscript to Major Charles W. Taylor, Eighteenth
Cavalry, commandant, Fort Sill, Oklahoma, who gave me some valuable suggestions as to additional
related information which I asked Geronimo to give. In most cases the old chief gave the desired
information, but in some instances he refused, stating his reasons for so doing.

When the added information had been incorporated I submitted the manuscript to President Roosevelt,
from whose letter I quote: "This is a very interesting volume which you have in manuscript,
but I would advise that you disclaim responsibility in all cases where the reputation of an
individual is assailed."

In accordance with that suggestion, I have appended notes throughout the book disclaiming responsibility
for adverse criticisms of any persons mentioned by Geronimo.

On June 2d, 1906, I transmitted the complete manuscript to the War Department. The following
quotation is from the letter of transmission:

     "In accordance with endorsement number eight of the 'Brief'
     submitted to me by the commanding officer of Fort Sill, which
     endorsement constituted the instructions of the Department, I
     submit herewith manuscript of the Autobiography of Geronimo.

     "The manuscript has been submitted to the President, and at his
     suggestion I have disclaimed any responsibility for the criticisms
     (made by Geronimo) of individuals mentioned."

Six weeks after the manuscript was forwarded, Thomas C. Barry, Brigadier General, Assistant
to the Chief of Staff, sent to the President the following:

     "MEMORANDUM FOR THE SECRETARY OF WAR.

     "Subject: Manuscript of the Autobiography of Geronimo. The paper
     herewith, which was referred to this office on July 6th, with
     instructions to report as to whether there is anything
     objectionable in it, is returned.

     "The manuscript is an interesting autobiography of a notable
     Indian, made by himself. There are a number of passages which,
     from the departmental point of view, are decidedly objectionable.
     These are found on pages 73, 74, 90, 91, and 97, and are indicated
     by marginal lines in red. The entire manuscript appears in a way
     important as showing the Indian side of a prolonged controversy,
     but it is believed that the document, either in whole or in part,
     should not receive the approval of the War Department."

The memorandum is published that the objections of the War Department may be made known to
the public.

The objection is raised to the mention on pages seventy-three and seventy-four of the manuscript
of an attack upon Indians in a tent at Apache Pass or Bowie, by U. S. soldiers. The statement
of Geronimo is, however, substantially confirmed by L. C. Hughes, editor of The Star, Tucson,
Arizona.

On pages ninety and ninety-one of the manuscript, Geronimo criticised General Crook. This criticism
is simply Geronimo's private opinion of General Crook. We deem it a personal matter and leave
it without comment, as it in no way concerns the history of the Apaches.

On page ninety-seven of the manuscript Geronimo accuses General Miles of bad faith. Of course,
General Miles made the treaty with the Apaches, but we know very well that he is not responsible
for the way the Government subsequently treated the prisoners of war. However, Geronimo cannot
understand this and fixes upon General Miles the blame for what he calls unjust treatment.

One could not expect the Department of War to approve adverse criticisms of its own acts, but
it is especially gratifying that such a liberal view has been taken of these criticisms, and
also that such a frank statement of the merits of the Autobiography is submitted in the memorandum.
Of course neither the President nor the War Department is in any way responsible for what Geronimo
says; he has simply been granted the opportunity to state his own case as he sees it.

The fact that Geronimo has told the story in his own way is doubtless the only excuse necessary
to offer for the many unconventional features of this work.

GERONIMO

CHAPTER I

ORIGIN OF THE APACHE INDIANS

In the beginning the world was covered with darkness. There was no sun, no day. The perpetual
night had no moon or stars.

There were, however, all manner of beasts and birds. Among the beasts were many hideous, nameless
monsters, as well as dragons, lions, tigers, wolves, foxes, beavers, rabbits, squirrels, rats,
mice, and all manner of creeping things such as lizards and serpents. Mankind could not prosper
under such conditions, for the beasts and serpents destroyed all human offspring.

All creatures had the power of speech and were gifted with reason.

There were two tribes of creatures: the birds or the feathered tribe and the beasts. The former
were organized under their chief, the eagle.

These tribes often held councils, and the birds wanted light admitted. This the beasts repeatedly
refused to do. Finally the birds made war against the beasts.

The beasts were armed with clubs, but the eagle had taught his tribe to use bows and arrows.
The serpents were so wise that they could not all be killed. One took refuge in a perpendicular
cliff of a mountain in Arizona, and his eye (changed into a brilliant stone) may be seen in
that rock to this day. The bears, when killed, would each be changed into several other bears,
so that the more bears the feathered tribe killed, the more there were. The dragon could not
be killed, either, for he was covered with four coats of horny scales, and the arrows would
not penetrate these. One of the most hideous, vile monsters (nameless) was proof against arrows,
so the eagle flew high up in the air with a round, white stone, and let it fall on this monster's
head, killing him instantly. This was such a good service that the stone was called sacred.
(A symbol of this stone is used in the tribal game of Kah.[1]) They fought for many days, but
at last the birds won the victory.

After this war was over, although some evil beasts remained, the birds were able to control
the councils, and light was admitted. Then mankind could live and prosper. The eagle was chief
in this good fight: therefore, his feathers were worn by man as emblems of wisdom, justice,
and power.

Among the few human beings that were yet alive was a woman who had been blessed with many children,
but these had always been destroyed by the beasts. If by any means she succeeded in eluding
the others, the dragon, who was very wise and very evil, would come himself and eat her babes.

After many years a son of the rainstorm was born to her and she dug for him a deep cave. The
entrance to this cave she closed and over the spot built a camp fire. This concealed the babe's
hiding place and kept him warm. Every day she would remove the fire and descend into the cave,
where the child's bed was, to nurse him; then she would return and rebuild the camp fire.

Frequently the dragon would come and question her, but she would say, "I have no more children;
you have eaten all of them."

When the child was larger he would not always stay in the cave, for he sometimes wanted to
run and play. Once the dragon saw his tracks. Now this perplexed and enraged the old dragon,
for he could not find the hiding place of the boy; but he said that he would destroy the mother
if she did not reveal the child's hiding place. The poor mother was very much troubled; she
could not give up her child, but she knew the power and cunning of the dragon, therefore she
lived in constant fear.

Soon after this the boy said that he wished to go hunting. The mother would not give her consent.
She told him of the dragon, the wolves, and the serpents; but he said, "To-morrow I go."

At the boy's request his uncle (who was the only man then living) made a little bow and some
arrows for him, and the two went hunting the next day. They trailed the deer far up the mountain
and finally the boy killed a buck. His uncle showed him how to dress the deer and broil the
meat. They broiled two hind quarters, one for the child and one for his uncle. When the meat
was done they placed it on some bushes to cool. Just then the huge form of the dragon appeared.
The child was not afraid, but his uncle was so dumb with fright that he did not speak or move.

The dragon took the boy's parcel of meat and went aside with it. He placed the meat on another
bush and seated himself beside it. Then he said, "This is the child I have been seeking. Boy,
you are nice and fat, so when I have eaten this venison I shall eat you." The boy said, "No,
you shall not eat me, and you shall not eat that meat." So he walked over to where the dragon
sat and took the meat back to his own seat. The dragon said, "I like your courage, but you
are foolish; what do you think you could do?" "Well," said the boy, "I can do enough to protect
myself, as you may find out." Then the dragon took the meat again, and then the boy retook
it. Four times in all the dragon took the meat, and after the fourth time the boy replaced
the meat he said, "Dragon, will you fight me?" The dragon said, "Yes, in whatever way you like."
The boy said, "I will stand one hundred paces distant from you and you may have four shots
at me with your bow and arrows, provided that you will then exchange places with me and give
me four shots." "Good," said the dragon. "Stand up."

Then the dragon took his bow, which was made of a large pine tree. He took four arrows from
his quiver; they were made of young pine tree saplings, and each arrow was twenty feet in length.
He took deliberate aim, but just as the arrow left the bow the boy made a peculiar sound and
leaped into the air. Immediately the arrow was shivered into a thousand splinters, and the
boy was seen standing on the top of a bright rainbow over the spot where the dragon's aim had
been directed. Soon the rainbow was gone and the boy was standing on the ground again. Four
times this was repeated, then the boy said, "Dragon, stand here; it is my time to shoot." The
dragon said, "All right; your little arrows cannot pierce my first coat of horn, and I have
three other coats--shoot away." The boy shot an arrow, striking the dragon just over the heart,
and one coat of the great horny scales fell to the ground. The next shot another coat, and
then another, and the dragon's heart was exposed. Then the dragon trembled, but could not move.
Before the fourth arrow was shot the boy said, "Uncle, you are dumb with fear; you have not
moved; come here or the dragon will fall on you." His uncle ran toward him. Then he sped the
fourth arrow with true aim, and it pierced the dragon's heart. With a tremendous roar the dragon
rolled down the mountain side--down four precipices into a cañon below.

Immediately storm clouds swept the mountains, lightning flashed, thunder rolled, and the rain
poured. When the rainstorm had passed, far down in the cañon below, they could see fragments
of the huge body of the dragon lying among the rocks, and the bones of this dragon may still
be found there.

This boy's name was Apache. Usen[2] taught him how to prepare herbs for medicine, how to hunt,
and how to fight. He was the first chief of the Indians and wore the eagle's feathers as the
sign of justice, wisdom, and power. To him, and to his people, as they were created, Usen gave
homes in the land of the west.

[2] Usen is the Apache word for God. It is used here because it implies the attributes of deity
that are held in their primitive religion. "Apache" means "Enemy."

CHAPTER II

SUBDIVISIONS OF THE APACHE TRIBE

The Apache Indians are divided into six sub-tribes. To one of these, the Be-don-ko-he, I belong.

Our tribe inhabited that region of mountainous country which lies west from the east line of
Arizona, and south from the headwaters of the Gila River.

East of us lived the Chi-hen-ne (Ojo Caliente), (Hot Springs) Apaches. Our tribe never had
any difficulty with them. Victoria, their chief, was always a friend to me. He always helped
our tribe when we asked him for help. He lost his life in the defense of the rights of his
people. He was a good man and a brave warrior. His son Charlie now lives here in this reservation
with us.

North of us lived the White Mountain Apaches. They were not always on the best of terms with
our tribe, yet we seldom had any war with them. I knew their chief, Hash-ka-ai-la, personally,
and I considered him a good warrior. Their range was next to that of the Navajo Indians, who
were not of the same blood as the Apaches. We held councils with all Apache tribes, but never
with the Navajo Indians. However, we traded with them and sometimes visited them.

To the west of our country ranged the Chi-e-a-hen Apaches. They had two chiefs within my time,
Co-si-to and Co-da-hoo-yah. They were friendly, but not intimate with our tribe.

South of us lived the Cho-kon-en (Chiricahua) Apaches, whose chief in the old days was Co-chise,
and later his son, Naiche. This tribe was always on the most friendly terms with us. We were
often in camp and on the trail together. Naiche, who was my companion in arms, is now my companion
in bondage.

To the south and west of us lived the Ned-ni Apaches. Their chief was Whoa, called by the Mexicans
Capitan Whoa. They were our firm friends. The land of this tribe lies partly in Old Mexico
and partly in Arizona.[3] Whoa and I often camped and fought side by side as brothers. My enemies
were his enemies, my friends his friends. He is dead now, but his son Asa is interpreting this
story for me.

Still the four tribes (Bedonkohe, Chokonen, Chihenne, and Nedni), who were fast friends in
the days of freedom, cling together as they decrease in number. Only the destruction of all
our people would dissolve our bonds of friendship.

We are vanishing from the earth, yet I cannot think we are useless or Usen would not have created
us. He created all tribes of men and certainly had a righteous purpose in creating each.

For each tribe of men Usen created He also made a home. In the land created for any particular
tribe He placed whatever would be best for the welfare of that tribe.

When Usen created the Apaches He also created their homes in the West. He gave to them such
grain, fruits, and game as they needed to eat. To restore their health when disease attacked
them He made many different herbs to grow. He taught them where to find these herbs, and how
to prepare them for medicine. He gave them a pleasant climate and all they needed for clothing
and shelter was at hand.

Thus it was in the beginning: the Apaches and their homes each created for the other by Usen
himself. When they are taken from these homes they sicken and die. How long[4] will it be until
it is said, there are no Apaches?

FOOTNOTES:

[3] The boundary lines established at different times between Mexico and the United States
did not conform to the boundary lines of these Apache tribes, of course, and the Indians soon
saw and took advantage of the international questions arising from the conflicting interests
of the two governments.

[4] The Apache Indians held prisoners of war are greatly decreasing in numbers. There seems
to be no particular cause, but nevertheless their numbers grow smaller.

CHAPTER III

EARLY LIFE

I was born in No-doyohn Cañon, Arizona, June, 1829.

In that country which lies around the headwaters of the Gila River I was reared. This range
was our fatherland; among these mountains our wigwams were hidden; the scattered valleys contained
our fields; the boundless prairies, stretching away on every side, were our pastures; the rocky
caverns were our burying places.

I was fourth[5] in a family of eight children--four boys and four girls. Of that family, only
myself, my brother, Porico (White Horse), and my sister, Nah-da-ste, are yet alive. We are
held as prisoners of war in this Military Reservation (Fort Sill).

As a babe I rolled on the dirt floor of my father's tepee, hung in my tsoch (Apache name for
cradle) at my mother's back, or suspended from the bough of a tree. I was warmed by the sun,
rocked by the winds, and sheltered by the trees as other Indian babes.

When a child my mother taught me the legends of our people; taught me of the sun and sky,'
the moon and stars, the clouds and storms. She also taught me to kneel and pray to Usen for
strength, health, wisdom, and protection. We never prayed against any person, but if we had
aught against any individual we ourselves took vengeance. We were taught that Usen does not
care for the petty quarrels of men.

My father had often told me of the brave deeds of our warriors, of the pleasures of the chase,
and the glories of the warpath.

With my brothers and sisters I played about my father's home. Sometimes we played at hide-and-seek
among the rocks and pines; sometimes we loitered in the shade of the cottonwood trees or sought
the shudock (a kind of wild cherry) while our parents worked in the field. Sometimes we played
that we were warriors. We would practice stealing upon some object that represented an enemy,
and in our childish imitation often perform the feats of war. Sometimes we would hide away
from our mother to see if she could find us, and often when thus concealed go to sleep and
perhaps remain hidden for many hours.

When we were old enough to be of real service we went to the field with our parents: not to
play, but to toil. When the crops were to be planted we broke the ground with wooden hoes.
We planted the corn in straight rows, the beans among the corn, and the melons and pumpkins
in irregular order over the field. We cultivated these crops as there was need.

Our field usually contained about two acres of ground. The fields were never fenced. It was
common for many families to cultivate land in the same valley and share the burden of protecting
the growing crops from destruction by the ponies of the tribe, or by deer and other wild animals.

Melons were gathered as they were consumed. In the autumn pumpkins and beans were gathered
and placed in bags or baskets; ears of corn were tied together by the husks, and then the harvest
was carried on the backs of ponies up to our homes. Here the corn was shelled, and all the
harvest stored away in caves or other secluded places to be used in winter.

We never fed corn to our ponies, but if we kept them up in the winter time we gave them fodder
to eat. We had no cattle or other domestic animals except our dogs and ponies.

We did not cultivate tobacco, but found it growing wild. This we cut and cured in autumn, but
if the supply ran out the leaves from the stalks left standing served our purpose. All Indians
smoked[6]--men and women. No boy was allowed to smoke until he had hunted alone and killed
large game--wolves and bears. Unmarried women were not prohibited from smoking, but were considered
immodest if they did so. Nearly all matrons smoked.

Besides grinding the corn (by hand with stone mortars and pestles) for bread, we sometimes
crushed it and soaked it, and after it had fermented made from this juice a "tis-win," which
had the power of intoxication, and was very highly prized by the Indians. This work was done
by the squaws and children. When berries or nuts were to be gathered the small children and
the squaws would go in parties to hunt them, and sometimes stay all day. When they went any
great distance from camp they took ponies to carry the baskets.

I frequently went with these parties, and upon one of these excursions a woman named Cho-ko-le
got lost from the party and was riding her pony through a thicket in search of her friends.
Her little dog was following as she slowly made her way through the thick underbrush and pine
trees. All at once a grizzly bear rose in her path and attacked the pony. She jumped off and
her pony escaped, but the bear attacked her, so she fought him the best she could with her
knife. Her little dog, by snapping at the bear's heels and detracting his attention from the
woman, enabled her for some time to keep pretty well out of his reach. Finally the grizzly
struck her over the head, tearing off almost her whole scalp. She fell, but did not lose consciousness,
and while prostrate struck him four good licks with her knife, and he retreated. After he had
gone she replaced her torn scalp and bound it up as best she could, then she turned deathly
sick and had to lie down. That night her pony came into camp with his load of nuts and berries,
but no rider. The Indians hunted for her, but did not find her until the second day. They carried
her home, and under the treatment of their medicine men all her wounds were healed.

The Indians knew what herbs to use for medicine, how to prepare them, and how to give the medicine.
This they had been taught by Usen in the beginning, and each succeeding generation had men
who were skilled in the art of healing.

In gathering the herbs, in preparing them, and in administering the medicine, as much faith
was held in prayer as in the actual effect of the medicine. Usually about eight persons worked
together in making medicine, and there were forms of prayer and incantations to attend each
stage of the process. Four attended to the incantations and four to the preparation of the herbs.

Some of the Indians were skilled in cutting out bullets, arrow heads, and other missiles with
which warriors were wounded. I myself have done much of this, using a common dirk or butcher
knife.[7]

Small children wore very little clothing in winter and none in the summer. Women usually wore
a primitive skirt, which consisted of a piece of cotton cloth fastened about the waist, and
extending to the knees. Men wore breech cloths and moccasins. In winter they had shirts and
leggings in addition.

Frequently when the tribe was in camp a number of boys and girls, by agreement, would steal
away and meet at a place several miles distant, where they could play all day free from tasks.
They were never punished for these frolics; but if their hiding places were discovered they
were ridiculed.

FOOTNOTES:

[5] Four is a magic number with the Bedonkohe Apaches. The dragon had four coats of scales;
he took little Apache's meat four times; they (the dragon and Apache) exchanged four shots--the
dragon rolled down four precipices. There are four moccasins used in the tribal game of Kah,
and only four plays that can be made. A boy must accompany the warriors four times on the warpath
before he can be admitted to the council.

Geronimo is the fourth of a family of four boys and four girls. He has had four wives that
were full-blood Bedonkohe Apaches, and four that were part Bedonkohe Apache and part other
Apache blood. Four of his children have been killed by Mexicans and four have been held in
bondage by the U. S. Government. He firmly believes in destiny and in the magic of the number
four. Besides Geronimo, only four full-blood Bedonkohe Apaches are now living. They are Porico
(White Horse), Nah-da-ste, Moh-ta-neal, and To-klon-nen.

[6] The Apaches did not smoke the peace pipe, unless it was proposed by some other Indians.
They had no large pipes; in fact, they usually smoked cigarettes made by rolling the tobacco
in wrappers of oak leaves.

[7] The only foundation for the statement, frequently made, that Geronimo was a medicine man.

CHAPTER IV

TRIBAL AMUSEMENTS, MANNERS, AND CUSTOMS

To celebrate each noted event a feast and dance would be given. Perhaps only our own people,
perhaps neighboring tribes would be invited. These festivities usually lasted for about four
days. By day we feasted, by night under the direction of some chief we danced. The music for
our dance was singing led by the warriors, and accompanied by beating the esadadedne (buckskin-on-a-hoop).
No words were sung--only the tones. When the feasting and dancing were over we would have horse
races, foot races, wrestling, jumping, and all sorts of games (gambling).

Among these games the most noted was the tribal game of Kah (foot). It is played as follows:
Four moccasins are placed about four feet apart in holes in the ground, dug in a row on one
side of the camp, and on the opposite side a similar parallel row. At night a camp fire is
started between these two rows of moccasins, and the players are arranged on sides, one or
any number on each side. The score is kept by a bundle of sticks, from which each side takes
a stick for every point won. First one side takes the bone (a symbol of the white rock used
by the eagle in slaying the nameless monster--see Chapter I), puts up blankets between the
four moccasins and the fire so that the opposing team cannot observe their movements, and then
begin to sing the legends of creation. The side having the bone represents the feathered tribe,
the opposite side represents the beasts. The players representing the birds do all the singing,
and while singing hide the bone in one of the moccasins, then the blankets are thrown down.
They continue to sing, but as soon as the blankets are thrown down the chosen player from the
opposing team, armed with a war club, comes to their side of the camp fire and with his club
strikes the moccasin in which he thinks the bone is hidden. If he strikes the right moccasin,
his side gets the bone, and in turn represents the birds, while the opposing team must keep
quiet and guess in turn. There are only four plays; three that lose and one that wins. When
all the sticks are gone from the bundle the side having the largest number of sticks is counted
winner.

This game is seldom played except as a gambling game, but for that purpose it is the most popular
game known to the tribe. Usually the game lasts four or five hours. It is never played in daytime.

After the games are all finished the visitors say, "We are satisfied," and the camp is broken
up. I was always glad when the dances and feasts were announced. So were all the other young
people.

Our life also had a religious side. We had no churches, no religious organizations, no sabbath
day, no holidays, and yet we worshiped. Sometimes the whole tribe would assemble to sing and
pray; sometimes a smaller number, perhaps only two or three. The songs had a few words, but
were not formal. The singer would occasionally put in such words as he wished instead of the
usual tone sound. Sometimes we prayed in silence; sometimes each one prayed aloud; sometimes
an aged person prayed for all of us. At other times one would rise and speak to us of our duties[8]
to each other and to Usen. Our services were short.

When disease or pestilence abounded we were assembled and questioned by our leaders to ascertain
what evil we had done, and how Usen could be satisfied. Sometimes sacrifice was deemed necessary.
Sometimes the offending one was punished.

If an Apache had allowed his aged parents to suffer for food or shelter, if he had neglected
or abused the sick, if he had profaned our religion, or had been unfaithful, he might be banished
from the tribe.

The Apaches had no prisons as white men have. Instead of sending their criminals into prison
they sent them out of their tribe. These faithless, cruel, lazy, or cowardly members of the
tribe were excluded in such a manner that they could not join any other tribe. Neither could
they have any protection from our unwritten tribal laws. Frequently these outlaw Indians banded
together and committed depredations which were charged against the regular tribe. However,
the life of an outlaw Indian was a hard lot, and their bands never became very large; besides,
these bands frequently provoked the wrath of the tribe and secured their own destruction.

When I was about eight or ten years old I began to follow the chase, and to me this was never work.

Out on the prairies, which ran up to our mountain homes, wandered herds of deer, antelope,
elk, and buffalo, to be slaughtered when we needed them.

Usually we hunted buffalo on horseback, killing them with arrows and spears. Their skins were
used to make tepees and bedding; their flesh, to eat.

It required more skill to hunt the deer than any other animal. We never tried to approach a
deer except against the wind. Frequently we would spend hours in stealing upon grazing deer.
If they were in the open we would crawl long distances on the ground, keeping a weed or brush
before us, so that our approach would not be noticed. Often we could kill several out of one
herd before the others would run away. Their flesh was dried and packed in vessels, and would
keep in this condition for many months. The hide of the deer was soaked in water and ashes
and the hair removed, and then the process of tanning continued until the buckskin was soft
and pliable. Perhaps no other animal was more valuable to us than the deer.

In the forests and along the streams were many wild turkeys. These we would drive to the plains,
then slowly ride up toward them until they were almost tired out. When they began to drop and
hide we would ride in upon them and by swinging from the side of our horses, catch them. If
one started to fly we would ride swiftly under him and kill him with a short stick, or hunting
club. In this way we could usually get as many wild turkeys as we could carry home on a horse.

There were many rabbits in our range, and we also hunted them on horseback. Our horses were
trained to follow the rabbit at full speed, and as they approached them we would swing from
one side of the horse and strike the rabbit with our hunting club. If he was too far away we
would throw the stick and kill him. This was great sport when we were boys, but as warriors
we seldom hunted small game.

There were many fish in the streams, but as we did not eat them, we did not try to catch or
kill them. Small boys sometimes threw stones at them or shot at them for practice with their
bows and arrows. Usen did not intend snakes, frogs, or fishes to be eaten. I have never eaten
of them.

There were many eagles in the mountains. These we hunted for their feathers. It required great
skill to steal upon an eagle, for besides having sharp eyes, he is wise and never stops at
any place where he does not have a good view of the surrounding country.

I have killed many bears with a spear, but was never injured in a fight with one. I have killed
several mountain lions with arrows, and one with a spear. Both bears and mountain lions are
good for food and valuable for their skin. When we killed them we carried them home on our
horses. We often made quivers for our arrows from the skin of the mountain lion. These were
very pretty and very durable.

During my minority we had never seen a missionary or a priest. We had never seen a white man.
Thus quietly lived the Be-don-ko-he Apaches.

FOOTNOTE:

[8] The Apaches recognized no duties to any man outside their tribe. It was no sin to kill
enemies or to rob them. However, if they accepted any favor from a stranger, or allowed him
to share their comforts in any way, he became (by adoption) related to the tribe and they must
recognize their duty to him.

CHAPTER V

THE FAMILY

My grandfather, Maco, had been our chief. I never saw him, but my father often told me of the
great size, strength, and sagacity of this old warrior. Their principal wars had been with
the Mexicans. They had some wars with other tribes of Indians also, but were seldom at peace
for any great length of time with the Mexican towns.

Maco died when my father was but a young warrior, and Mangus-Colorado[9] became chief of the
Bedonkohe Apaches. When I was but a small boy my father died, after having been sick for some
time. When he passed away, carefully the watchers closed his eyes, then they arrayed him in
his best clothes, painted his face afresh, wrapped a rich blanket around him, saddled his favorite
horse, bore his arms in front of him, and led his horse behind, repeating in wailing tones
his deeds of valor as they carried his body to a cave in the mountain. Then they slew his horses,
and we gave away all of his other property,[10] as was customary in our tribe, after which
his body was deposited in the cave, his arms beside him. His grave is hidden by piles of stone.
Wrapped in splendor he lies in seclusion, and the winds in the pines sing a low requiem over
the dead warrior.

After my father's death I assumed the care of my mother. She never married again, although
according to the customs of our tribe she might have done so immediately after his death. Usually,
however, the widow who has children remains single after her husband's death for two or three
years; but the widow without children marries again immediately. After a warrior's death his
widow returns to her people and may be given away or sold by her father or brothers. My mother
chose to live with me, and she never desired to marry again. We lived near our old home and
I supported her.

In 1846, being seventeen years of age, I was admitted to the council of the warriors. Then
I was very happy, for I could go wherever I wanted and do whatever I liked. I had not been
under the control of any individual, but the customs of our tribe prohibited me from sharing
the glories of the warpath until the council admitted me. When opportunity offered, after this,
I could go on the warpath with my tribe. This would be glorious. I hoped soon to serve my people
in battle. I had long desired to fight with our warriors.

Perhaps the greatest joy to me was that now I could marry the fair Alope, daughter of No-po-so.
She was a slender, delicate girl, but we had been lovers for a long time. So, as soon as the
council granted me these privileges I went to see her father concerning our marriage. Perhaps
our love was of no interest to him; perhaps he wanted to keep Alope with him, for she was a
dutiful daughter; at any rate he asked many ponies for her. I made no reply, but in a few days
appeared before his wigwam with the herd of ponies and took with me Alope. This was all the
marriage ceremony necessary in our tribe.

Not far from my mother's tepee I had made for us a new home. The tepee was made of buffalo
hides and in it were many bear robes, lion hides, and other trophies of the chase, as well
as my spears, bows, and arrows. Alope had made many little decorations of beads[11] and drawn
work on buckskin, which she placed in our tepee. She also drew many pictures on the walls of
our home. She was a good wife, but she was never strong. We followed the traditions of our
fathers and were happy. Three children came to us--children that played, loitered, and worked
as I had done.

FOOTNOTES:

[9] Maco was chief of the Nedni Apaches. His son (Geronimo's father) had married a Bedonkohe
Apache (Geronimo's mother) and joined her tribe, thereby losing his right to rule by heredity.
By this it will be seen Geronimo could not become chief by hereditary right, although his grandfather
was a chieftain. It is also shown that Geronimo's father could not be chief, hence the accession
of Mangus-Colorado.

[10] The Apaches will not keep any of the property of a deceased relative. Their unwritten
tribal laws forbid it, because they think that otherwise the children or other relatives of
one who had much property might be glad when their father or relatives died.

[11] Beads were obtained from the Mexicans. The Apaches also got money from the Mexicans, but
deemed it of no value, and either gave it to their children to play with or threw it away.

PART II

THE MEXICANS

CHAPTER VI

KAS-KI-YEH

Part I--The Massacre

In the summer of 1858, being at peace with the Mexican towns as well as with all the neighboring
Indian tribes, we went south into Old Mexico to trade. Our whole tribe (Bedonkohe Apaches)
went through Sonora toward Casa Grande, our destination, but just before reaching that place
we stopped at another Mexican town called by the Indians "Kas-ki-yeh." Here we stayed for several
days, camping just outside the city. Every day we would go into town to trade, leaving our
camp under the protection of a small guard so that our arms, supplies, and women and children
would not be disturbed during our absence.

Late one afternoon when returning from town we were met by a few women and children who told
us that Mexican troops from some other town had attacked our camp, killed all the warriors
of the guard, captured all our ponies, secured our arms, destroyed our supplies, and killed
many of our women and children. Quickly we separated, concealing ourselves as best we could
until nightfall, when we assembled at our appointed place of rendezvous--a thicket by the river.
Silently we stole in one by one: sentinels were placed, and, when all were counted, I found
that my aged mother, my young wife, and my three small children were among the slain. There
were no lights in camp, so without being noticed I silently turned away and stood by the river.
How long I stood there I do not know, but when I saw the warriors arranging for a council I
took my place.

That night I did not give my vote for or against any measure; but it was decided that as there
were only eighty warriors left, and as we were without arms or supplies, and were furthermore
surrounded by the Mexicans far inside their own territory, we could not hope to fight successfully.
So our chief, Mangus-Colorado, gave the order to start at once in perfect silence for our homes
in Arizona, leaving the dead upon the field.

I stood until all had passed, hardly knowing what I would do--I had no weapon, nor did I hardly
wish to fight, neither did I contemplate recovering the bodies of my loved ones, for that was
forbidden. I did not pray, nor did I resolve to do anything in particular, for I had no purpose
left. I finally followed the tribe silently, keeping just within hearing distance of the soft
noise of the feet of the retreating Apaches.

The next morning some of the Indians killed a small amount of game and we halted long enough
for the tribe to cook and eat, when the march was resumed. I had killed no game, and did not
eat. During the first march as well as while we were camped at this place I spoke to no one
and no one spoke to me--there was nothing to say.

For two days and three nights we were on forced marches, stopping only for meals, then we made
a camp near the Mexican border, where we rested two days. Here I took some food and talked
with the other Indians who had lost in the massacre, but none had lost as I had, for I had
lost all.

Within a few days we arrived at our own settlement. There were the decorations that Alope had
made--and there were the playthings of our little ones. I burned[12] them all, even our tepee.
I also burned my mother's tepee and destroyed all her property.

I was never again contented in our quiet home. True, I could visit my father's grave, but I
had vowed vengeance upon the Mexican troopers who had wronged me, and whenever I came near
his grave or saw anything to remind me of former happy days my heart would ache for revenge
upon Mexico.

Part II--Revenge

As soon as we had again collected some arms and supplies Mangus-Colorado, our chief, called
a council and found that all our warriors were willing to take the warpath against Mexico.
I was appointed to solicit the aid of other tribes in this war.

When I went to the Chokonen (Chiricahua) Apaches, Cochise, their chief, called a council at
early dawn. Silently the warriors assembled at an open place in a mountain dell and took their
seats on the ground, arranged in rows according to their ranks. Silently they sat smoking.
At a signal from the chief I arose and presented my cause as follows:

"Kinsman, you have heard what the Mexicans have recently done without cause. You are my relatives--uncles,
cousins, brothers. We are men the same as the Mexicans are--we can do to them what they have
done to us. Let us go forward and trail them--I will lead you to their city--we will attack
them in their homes. I will fight in the front of the battle--I only ask you to follow me to
avenge this wrong done by these Mexicans--will you come? It is well--you will all come.

"Remember the rule in war--men may return or they may be killed. If any of these young men
are killed I want no blame from their kinsmen, for they themselves have chosen to go. If I
am killed no one need mourn for me. My people have all been killed in that country, and I,
too, will die if need be."

I returned to my own settlement, reported this success to my chieftain, and immediately departed
to the southward into the land of the Nedni Apaches. Their chief, Whoa, heard me without comment,
but he immediately issued orders for a council, and when all were ready gave a sign that I
might speak. I addressed them as I had addressed the Chokonen tribe, and they also promised
to help us.

It was in the summer of 1859, almost a year from the date of the massacre of Kaskiyeh, that
these three tribes were assembled on the Mexican border to go upon the warpath. Their faces
were painted, the war bands[13] fastened upon their brows, their long scalp-locks[14] ready
for the hand and knife of the warrior who could overcome them. Their families had been hidden
away in a mountain rendezvous near the Mexican border. With these families a guard was posted,
and a number of places of rendezvous designated in case the camp should be disturbed.

When all were ready the chieftains gave command to go forward. None of us were mounted and
each warrior wore moccasins and also a cloth wrapped about his loins. This cloth could be spread
over him when he slept, and when on the march would be ample protection as clothing. In battle,
if the fight was hard, we did not wish much clothing. Each warrior carried three days' rations,
but as we often killed game while on the march, we seldom were without food.

We traveled in three divisions: the Bedonkohe Apaches led by Mangus-Colorado, the Chokonen
Apaches by Cochise, and the Nedni Apaches by Whoa; however, there was no regular order inside
the separate tribes. We usually marched about fourteen hours per day, making three stops for
meals and traveling forty to forty-five miles a day.

I acted as guide into Mexico, and we followed the river courses and mountain ranges because
we could better thereby keep our movements concealed. We entered Sonora and went southward
past Quitaco, Nacozari, and many smaller settlements.

When we were almost at Arispe we camped, and eight men rode out from the city to parley with
us. These we captured, killed, and scalped. This was to draw the troops from the city, and
the next day they came. The skirmishing lasted all day without a general engagement, but just
at night we captured their supply train, so we had plenty of provisions and some more guns.

That night we posted sentinels and did not move our camp, but rested quietly all night, for
we expected heavy work the next day. Early the next morning the warriors were assembled to
pray--not for help, but that they might have health and avoid ambush or deceptions by the enemy.

As we had anticipated, about ten o'clock in the morning the whole Mexican force came out. There
were two companies of cavalry and two of infantry. I recognized the cavalry as the soldiers
who had killed my people at Kaskiyeh. This I told to the chieftains, and they said that I might
direct the battle.

I was no chief and never had been, but because I had been more deeply wronged than others,
this honor was conferred upon me, and I resolved to prove worthy of the trust. I arranged the
Indians in a hollow circle near the river, and the Mexicans drew their infantry up in two lines,
with the cavalry in reserve. We were in the timber, and they advanced until within about four
hundred yards, when they halted and opened fire. Soon I led a charge against them, at the same
time sending some braves to attack their rear. In all the battle I thought of my murdered mother,
wife, and babies--of my father's grave and my vow of vengeance, and I fought with fury. Many
fell by my hand, and constantly I led the advance. Many braves were killed. The battle lasted
about two hours.

At the last four Indians were alone in the center of the field--myself and three other warriors.
Our arrows were all gone, our spears broken off in the bodies of dead enemies. We had only
our hands and knives with which to fight, but all who had stood against us were dead. Then
two armed soldiers came upon us from another part of the field. They shot down two of our men
and we, the remaining two, fled toward our own warriors. My companion was struck down by a
saber, but I reached our warriors, seized a spear, and turned. The one who pursued me missed
his aim and fell by my spear. With his saber I met the trooper who had killed my companion
and we grappled and fell. I killed him with my knife and quickly rose over his body, brandishing
his saber, seeking for other troopers to kill. There were none. But the Apaches had seen. Over
the bloody field, covered with the bodies of Mexicans, rang the fierce Apache war-whoop.

Still covered with the blood of my enemies, still holding my conquering weapon, still hot with
the joy of battle, victory, and vengeance, I was surrounded by the Apache braves and made war
chief of all the Apaches. Then I gave orders for scalping the slain.[15]

I could not call back my loved ones, I could not bring back the dead Apaches, but I could rejoice
in this revenge. The Apaches had avenged the massacre of "Kas-ki-yeh."

to war is called by its sacred name; as if, for instance, in English, one should say not horse,
but war-horse or charger; not arrow, but missile of death. The Indian is not called by his
ordinary name, but by a sacred name to which is subjoined "brave" or "chief" as the case may
be. Geronimo's Indian name was Go khlä yeh, but the Mexicans at this battle called him Geronimo,
a name he has borne ever since both among the Indians and white men.

CHAPTER VII

FIGHTING UNDER DIFFICULTIES

All the other Apaches were satisfied after the battle of "Kaskiyeh," but I still desired more
revenge. For several months we were busy with the chase and other peaceful pursuits. Finally
I succeeded in persuading two others warriors, Ah-koch-ne and Ko-deh-ne, to go with me to invade
the Mexican country.

We left our[16] families with the tribe and went on the warpath. We were on foot and carried
three days' rations. We entered Mexico on the north line of Sonora and followed the Sierra
de Antunez Mountains to the south end of the range. Here we decided to attack a small village.
(I do not know the name of this village.) At daylight we approached from the mountains. Five
horses were hitched outside. We advanced cautiously, but just before we reached the horses
the Mexicans opened fire from the houses. My two companions were killed. Mexicans swarmed on
every side; some were mounted; some were on foot, and all seemed to be armed. Three times that
day I was surrounded, but I kept fighting, dodging, and hiding. Several times during the day
while in concealment I had a chance to take deliberate aim at some Mexican, who, gun in hand,
was looking for me. I do not think I missed my aim either time. With the gathering darkness
I found more time to retreat toward Arizona. But the Mexicans did not quit the chase. Several
times the next day mounted Mexicans tried to head me off; many times they fired on me, but
I had no more arrows; so I depended upon running and hiding, although I was very tired. I had
not eaten since the chase began, nor had I dared to stop for rest. The second night I got clear
of my pursuers, but I never slackened my pace until I reached our home in Arizona. I came into
our camp without booty, without my companions, exhausted, but not discouraged.

The wives and children of my two dead companions were cared for by their people. Some of the
Apaches blamed me for the evil result of the expedition, but I said nothing. Having failed,
it was only proper that I should remain silent. But my feelings toward the Mexicans did not
change--I still hated them and longed for revenge. I never ceased to plan for their punishment,
but it was hard to get the other warriors to listen to my proposed raids.

In a few months after this last adventure I persuaded two other warriors to join me in raiding
the Mexican frontier. On our former raid we had gone through the Nedni Apaches' range into
Sonora. This time we went through the country of the Cho-kon-en and entered the Sierra Madre
Mountains. We traveled south, secured more rations, and prepared to begin our raids. We had
selected a village near the mountains which we intended to attack at daylight. While asleep
that night Mexican scouts discovered our camp and fired on us, killing one warrior. In the
morning we observed a company of Mexican troops coming from the south. They were mounted and
carried supplies for a long journey. We followed their trail until we were sure that they were
headed for our range in Arizona; then we hurried past them and in three days reached our own
settlement. We arrived at noon, and that afternoon, about three o'clock, these Mexican troops
attacked our settlement. Their first volley killed three small boys. Many of the warriors of
our tribe were away from home, but the few of us who were in camp were able to drive the troops
out of the mountains before night. We killed eight Mexicans and lost five--two warriors and
three boys. The Mexicans rode due south in full retreat. Four warriors were detailed to follow
them, and in three days these trailers returned, saying that the Mexican cavalry had left Arizona,
going southward. We were quite sure they would not return soon.

Soon after this (in the summer of 1860) I was again able to take the warpath against the Mexicans,
this time with twenty-five warriors. We followed the trail of the Mexican troops last mentioned
and entered the Sierra de Sahuaripa Mountains. The second day in these mountains our scouts
discovered mounted Mexican troops. There was only one company of cavalry in this command, and
I thought that by properly surprising them we could defeat them. We ambushed the trail over
which they were to come. This was at a place where the whole company must pass through a mountain
defile. We reserved fire until all of the troops had passed through; then the signal was given.
The Mexican troopers, seemingly without a word of command, dismounted, and placing their horses
on the outside of the company, for breastworks, made a good fight against us. I saw that we
could not dislodge them without using all our ammunition, so I led a charge. The warriors suddenly
pressed in from all sides and we fought hand to hand. During this encounter I raised my spear
to kill a Mexican soldier just as he leveled his gun at me; I was advancing rapidly, and my
foot slipping in a pool of blood, I fell under the Mexican trooper. He struck me over the head
with the butt of his gun, knocking me senseless. Just at that instant a warrior who followed
in my footsteps killed the Mexican with a spear. In a few minutes not a Mexican soldier was
left alive. When the Apache war-cry had died away, and their enemies had been scalped, they
began to care for their dead and wounded. I was found lying unconscious where I had fallen.
They bathed my head in cold water and restored me to consciousness. Then they bound up my wound
and the next morning, although weak from loss of blood and suffering from a severe headache,
I was able to march on the return to Arizona. I did not fully recover for months, and I still
wear the scar given me by that musketeer. In this fight we had lost so heavily that there really
was no glory in our victory, and we returned to Arizona. No one seemed to want to go on the
warpath again that year.

In the summer (1861) with twelve warriors I again went into Mexico. We entered Chihuahua and
followed south on the east side of the Sierra Madre Mountains four days' journey; then crossed
over to the Sierra de Sahuaripa range, not far east of Casa Grande. Here we rested one day,
and sent out scouts to reconnoiter. They reported pack trains camped five miles west of us.
The next morning just at daybreak, as these drivers were starting with their mule pack train,
we attacked them. They rode away for their lives, leaving us the booty. The mules were loaded
with provisions, most of which we took home. Two mules were loaded with side-meat or bacon;[17]
this we threw away. We started to take these pack trains home, going northward through Sonora,
but when near Casita, Mexican troops overtook us. It was at daybreak and we were just finishing
our breakfast. We had no idea that we had been pursued or that our enemies were near until
they opened fire. At the first volley a bullet struck me a glancing lick just at the lower
corner of the left eye and I fell unconscious. All the other Indians fled to cover. The Mexicans,
thinking me dead, started in pursuit of the fleeing Indians. In a few moments I regained consciousness
and had started at full speed for the woods when another company coming up opened fire on me.
Then the soldiers who had been chasing the other Indians turned, and I stood between two hostile
companies, but I did not stand long. Bullets whistled in every direction and at close range
to me. One inflicted a slight flesh wound on my side, but I kept running, dodging, and fighting,
until I got clear of my pursuers. I climbed up a steep cañon, where the cavalry could not follow.
The troopers saw me, but did not dismount and try to follow. I think they were wise not to come on.

It had been understood that in case of surprise with this booty, our place of rendezvous should
be the Santa Bita Mountains in Arizona. We did not reassemble in Mexico, but traveled separately
and in three days we were encamped in our place of rendezvous. From this place we returned
home empty-handed. We had not even a partial victory to report. I again returned wounded, but
I was not yet discouraged. Again I was blamed by our people, and again I had no reply.

After our return many of the warriors had gone on a hunt and some of them had gone north to
trade for blankets from the Navajo Indians. I remained at home trying to get my wounds healed.
One morning just at daybreak, when the squaws were lighting the camp fires to prepare breakfast,
three companies of Mexican troops who had surrounded our settlement in the night opened fire.
There was no time for fighting. Men, women, and children fled for their lives. Many women and
children and a few warriors were killed, and four women were captured. My left eye was still
swollen shut, but with the other I saw well enough to hit one of the officers with an arrow,
and then make good my escape among the rocks. The troopers burned our tepees and took our arms,
provisions, ponies, and blankets. Winter was at hand.

There were not more than twenty warriors in camp at this time, and only a few of us had secured
weapons during the excitement of the attack. A few warriors followed the trail of the troops
as they went back to Mexico with their booty, but were unable to offer battle. It was a long,
long time before we were again able to go on the warpath against the Mexicans.

The four women who were captured at this time by the Mexicans were taken into Sonora, Mexico,
where they were compelled to work for the Mexicans. After some years they escaped to the mountains
and started to find our tribe. They had knives which they had stolen from the Mexicans, but
they had no other weapons. They had no blankets; so at night they would make a little tepee
by cutting brush with their knives, and setting them up for the walls. The top was covered
over with brush. In this temporary tepee they would all sleep. One night when their camp fire
was low they heard growling just outside the tepee. Francisco, the youngest woman of the party
(about seventeen years of age), started to build up the fire, when a mountain lion crashed
through the tepee and attacked her. The suddenness of the attack made her drop her knife, but
she fought as best she could with her hand. She was no match for the lion, however; her left
shoulder was crushed and partly torn away. The lion kept trying to catch her by the throat;
this she prevented with her hands for a long time. He dragged her for about 300 yards, then
she found her strength was failing her from loss of blood, and she called to the other women
for help. The lion had been dragging her by one foot, and she had been catching hold of his
legs, and of the rocks and underbrush, to delay him. Finally he stopped and stood over her.
She again called her companions and they attacked him with their knives and killed him. Then
they dressed her wounds and nursed her in the mountains for about a month. When she was again
able to walk they resumed their journey and reached our tribe in safety.

This woman (Francisco) was held as a prisoner of war with the other Apaches and died on the
Fort Sill Reservation in 1892. Her face was always disfigured with those scars and she never
regained perfect use of her hands. The three older women died before we became prisoners of war.

Many women and children were carried away at different times by Mexicans. Not many of them
ever returned, and those who did underwent many hardships in order to be again united with
their people. Those who did not escape were slaves to the Mexicans, or perhaps even more degraded.

When warriors were captured by the Mexicans they were kept in chains. Four warriors who were
captured once at a place north of Casa Grande, called by the Indians "Honas," were kept in
chains for a year and a half, when they were exchanged for Mexicans whom we had captured.

We never chained prisoners or kept them in confinement, but they seldom got away. Mexican men
when captured were compelled to cut wood and herd horses. Mexican women and children[18] were
treated as our own people.

FOOTNOTES:

[16] Geronimo had married again.

[17] They had never eaten bacon and did not learn to do so for a long time. Even now they will
not eat bacon or pork if they can get other meat. Geronimo positively refuses to eat bacon or pork.

play with the Apache children, but was finally exchanged.

One of Geronimo's wives and her child were killed at this time, and thenceforth until he became
a prisoner of war he had two wives. He might have had as many wives as he wished, but he says
that he was so busy fighting Mexicans that he could not support more than two.

CHAPTER VIII

RAIDS THAT WERE SUCCESSFUL

In the summer of 1862 I took eight men and invaded Mexican territory. We went south on the
west side of the Sierra Madre Mountains for five days; then in the night crossed over to the
southern part of the Sierra de Sahuaripa range. Here we again camped to watch for pack trains.
About ten o'clock next morning four drivers, mounted, came past our camp with a pack-mule train.
As soon as they saw us they rode for their lives, leaving us the booty. This was a long train,
and packed with blankets, calico, saddles, tinware, and loaf sugar. We hurried home as fast
as we could with these provisions, and on our return while passing through a cañon in the Santa
Catilina range of mountains in Arizona, met a white man driving a mule pack train. When we
first saw him he had already seen us, and was riding at full tilt up the cañon. We examined
his train and found that his mules were all loaded with cheese. We put them in with the other
train and resumed our journey. We did not attempt to trail the driver and I am sure he did
not try to follow us.

In two days we arrived at home. Then Mangus-Colorado, our chief, assembled the tribe. We gave
a feast, divided the spoils, and danced all night. Some of the pack mules were killed and eaten.

This time after our return we kept out scouts so that we would know if Mexican troops should
attempt to follow us.

On the third day our scouts came into camp and reported Mexican cavalry dismounted and approaching
our settlement. All our warriors were in camp. Mangus-Colorado took command of one division
and I of the other. We hoped to get possession of their horses, then surround the troops in
the mountains, and destroy the whole company. This we were unable to do, for they, too, had
scouts. However, within four hours after we started we had killed ten troopers with the loss
of only one man, and the Mexican cavalry was in full retreat, followed by thirty armed Apaches,
who gave them no rest until they were far inside the Mexican country. No more troops came that
winter.

For a long time we had plenty of provisions, plenty of blankets, and plenty of clothing. We
also had plenty of cheese and sugar.

Another summer (1863) I selected three warriors and went on a raid into Mexico. We went south
into Sonora, camping in the Sierra de Sahuaripa Mountains. About forty miles west of Casa Grande
is a small village in the mountains, called by the Indians "Crassanas." We camped near this
place and concluded to make an attack. We had noticed that just at midday no one seemed to
be stirring; so we planned to make our attack at the noon hour. The next day we stole into
the town at noon. We had no guns, but were armed with spears and bows and arrows. When the
war-whoop was given to open the attack the Mexicans fled in every direction; not one of them
made any attempt to fight us.

We shot some arrows at the retreating Mexicans, but killed only one. Soon all was silent in
the town and no Mexicans could be seen.

When we discovered that all the Mexicans were gone we looked through their houses and saw many
curious things. These Mexicans kept many more kinds of property than the Apaches did. Many
of the things we saw in the houses we could not understand, but in the stores we saw much that
we wanted; so we drove in a herd of horses and mules, and packed as much provisions and supplies
as we could on them. Then we formed these animals into a pack train and returned safely to
Arizona. The Mexicans did not even trail us.

When we arrived in camp we called the tribe together and feasted all day. We gave presents
to everyone. That night the dance began, and it did not cease until noon the next day.

This was perhaps the most successful raid ever made by us into Mexican territory. I do not
know the value of the booty, but it was very great, for we had supplies enough to last our
whole tribe for a year or more.

In the fall of 1864 twenty warriors were willing to go with me on another raid into Mexico.
These were all chosen men, well armed and equipped for battle. As usual we provided for the
safety of our families before starting on this raid. Our whole tribe scattered and then reassembled
at a camp about forty miles from the former place. In this way it would be hard for the Mexicans
to trail them and we would know where to find our families when we returned. Moreover, if any
hostile Indians should see this large number of warriors leaving our range they might attack
our camp, but if they found no one at the usual place their raid would fail.

We went south through the Chokonen Apaches' range, entered Sonora, Mexico, at a point directly
south of Tombstone, Arizona, and went into hiding in the Sierra de Antunez Mountains.

We attacked several settlements in the neighborhood and secured plenty of provisions and supplies.
After about three days we attacked and captured a mule pack train at a place called by the
Indians "Pontoco." It is situated in the mountains due west, about one day's journey[19] from
Arispe.

There were three drivers with this train. One was killed and two escaped. The train was loaded
with mescal,[20] which was contained in bottles held in wicker baskets. As soon as we made
camp the Indians began to get drunk and fight each other. I, too, drank enough mescal to feel
the effect of it, but I was not drunk. I ordered the fighting stopped, but the order was disobeyed.
Soon almost a general fight was in progress. I tried to place a guard out around our camp,
but all were drunk and refused to serve. I expected an attack from Mexican troops at any moment,
and really it was a serious matter for me, for being in command I would be held responsible
for any ill luck attending the expedition. Finally the camp became comparatively still, for
the Indians were too drunk to walk or even to fight. While they were in this stupor I poured
out all the mescal, then I put out all the fires and moved the pack mules to a considerable
distance from camp. After this I returned to camp to try to do something for the wounded. I
found that only two were dangerously wounded. From the leg of one of these I cut an arrow head,
and from the shoulder of another I withdrew a spear point. When all the wounds had been cared
for, I myself kept guard till morning. The next day we loaded our wounded on the pack mules
and started for Arizona.

The next day we captured come cattle from a herd and drove them home with us. But it was a
very difficult matter to drive cattle when we were on foot. Caring for the wounded and keeping
the cattle from escaping made our journey tedious. But we were not trailed, and arrived safely
at home with all the booty.

We then gave a feast and dance, and divided the spoils. After the dance we killed all the cattle
and dried the meat. We dressed the hides and then the dried meat was packed in between these
hides and stored away. All that winter we had plenty of meat. These were the first cattle we
ever had. As usual we killed and ate some of the mules. We had little use for mules, and if
we could not trade them for something of value, we killed them.

In the summer of 1865, with four warriors, I went again into Mexico. Heretofore we had gone
on foot; we were accustomed to fight on foot; besides, we could more easily conceal ourselves
when dismounted. But this time we wanted more cattle, and it was hard to drive them when we
were on foot. We entered Sonora at a point southwest from Tombstone, Arizona, and followed
the Sierra de Antunez Mountains to the southern limit, then crossed the country as far south
as the mouth of Yaqui River. Here we saw a great lake[21] extending beyond the limit of sight.
Then we turned north, attacked several settlements, and secured plenty of supplies. When we
had come back northwest of Arispe we secured about sixty head of cattle, and drove them to
our homes in Arizona. We did not go directly home, but camped in different valleys with our
cattle. We were not trailed. When we arrived at our camp the tribe was again assembled for
feasting and dancing. Presents were given to everybody; then the cattle were killed and the
meat dried and packed.

CHAPTER IX

VARYING FORTUNES

In the fall of 1865 with nine other warriors I went into Mexico on foot. We attacked several
settlements south of Casa Grande, and collected many horses and mules. We made our way northward
with these animals through the mountains. When near Arispe we made camp one evening, and thinking
that we were not being trailed, turned loose the whole herd, even those we had been riding.
They were in a valley surrounded by steep mountains, and we were camped at the mouth of this
valley so that the animals could not leave without coming through our camp. Just as we had
begun to eat our supper our scouts came in and announced Mexican troops coming toward our camp.
We started for the horses, but troops that our scouts had not seen were on the cliffs above
us, and opened fire. We scattered in all directions, and the troops recovered all our booty.
In three days we reassembled at our appointed place of rendezvous in the Sierra Madre Mountains
in northern Sonora. Mexican troops did not follow us, and we returned to Arizona without any
more fighting and with no booty. Again I had nothing to say, but I was anxious for another raid.

Early the next summer (1866) I took thirty mounted warriors and invaded Mexican territory.
We went south through Chihuahua as far as Santa Cruz, Sonora, then crossed over the Sierra
Madre Mountains, following the river course at the south end of the range. We kept on westward
from the Sierra Madre Mountains to the Sierra de Sahuripa Mountains, and followed that range
northward. We collected all the horses, mules, and cattle we wanted, and drove them northward
through Sonora into Arizona. Mexicans saw us at many times and in many places, but they did
not attack us at any time, nor did any troops attempt to follow us. When we arrived at our
homes we gave presents to all, and the tribe feasted and danced. During this raid we had killed
about fifty Mexicans.

Next year (1867) Mangus-Colorado led eight warriors on a raid into Mexico. I went as a warrior,
for I was always glad to fight the Mexicans. We rode south from near Tombstone, Arizona, into
Sonora, Mexico. We attacked some cowboys, and after a fight with them, in which two of their
number were killed, we drove all their cattle northward. The second day we were driving the
cattle, but had no scouts out. When we were not far from Arispe, Mexican troops rode upon us.
They were well armed and well mounted, and when we first saw them they were not half a mile
away from us. We left the cattle and rode as hard as we could toward the mountains, but they
gained on us rapidly. Soon they opened fire, but were so far away from us that we were unable
to reach them with our arrows; finally we reached some timber, and, leaving our ponies, fought
from cover. Then the Mexicans halted, collected our ponies, and rode away across the plains
toward Arispe, driving the cattle with them. We stood and watched them until they disappeared
in the distance, and then took up our march for home.

We arrived home in five days with no victory to report, no spoils to divide, and not even the
ponies which we had ridden into Mexico. This expedition was considered disgraceful.

The warriors who had been with Mangus-Colorado on this last expedition wanted to return to
Mexico. They were not satisfied, besides they felt keenly the taunts of the other warriors.
Mangus-Colorado would not lead them back, so I took command and we went on foot, directly toward
Arispe in Sonora, and made our camp in the Sierra de Sahuripa Mountains. There were only six
of us, but we raided several settlements (at night), captured many horses and mules, and loaded
them with provisions, saddles and blankets. Then we returned to Arizona, traveling only at
night. When we arrived at our camp we sent out scouts to prevent any surprise by Mexicans,
assembled the tribe, feasted, danced, and divided the spoils. Mangus-Colorado would not receive
any of this booty, but we did not care. No Mexican troops followed us to Arizona.

About a year after this (1868) Mexican troops rounded up all the horses and mules of the tribe
not far from our settlement. No raids had been made into Mexico that year, and we were not
expecting any attacks. We were all in camp, having just returned from hunting.

About two o'clock in the afternoon two Mexican scouts were seen near our settlement. We killed
these scouts, but the troops got under way with the herd of our horses and mules before we
saw them. It was useless to try to overtake them on foot, and our tribe had not a horse left.
I took twenty warriors and trailed them. We found the stock at a cattle ranch in Sonora, not
far from Nacozari, and attacked the cowboys who had them in charge. We killed two men and lost
none. After the fight we drove off our own stock and all of theirs.

We were trailed by nine cowboys. I sent the stock on ahead and with three warriors stayed in
the rear to intercept any attacking parties. One night when near the Arizona line we discovered
these cowboys on our trail and watched them camp for the night and picket their horses. About
midnight we stole into their camp and silently led away all their horses, leaving the cowboys
asleep. Then we rode hard and overtook our companions, who always traveled at night instead
of in the daytime. We turned these horses in with the herd and fell back to again intercept
anyone who might trail us. What these nine cowboys did next morning I do not know, and I have
never heard the Mexicans say anything about it; I know they did not follow us, for we were
not molested. When we arrived in camp at home there was great rejoicing in the tribe. It was
considered a good trick to get the Mexicans' horses and leave them asleep in the mountains.

It was a long time before we again went into Mexico or were disturbed by the Mexicans.

CHAPTER X

OTHER RAIDS

When reading the foregoing chapters of Apache raids one not acquainted with the lawlessness
of the frontier might wonder how this tendency of the Apaches was developed to such a marked
degree; but one acquainted with the real conditions--the disregard for law by both Mexicans
and white men along the border line of Old Mexico and Arizona in early days--can readily understand
where the Apache got his education in the art of conducting lawless raids. In order, therefore,
that those who are unacquainted with the conditions as they were in southern Arizona during
the eighties, may understand the environment of the Apaches, this chapter is given. The events
herein narrated are taken by the author from many accounts given him by reliable men who lived
in this section of country during the period mentioned.

Raid by White Men

In 1882 a company of six Mexican traders, who were known as "smugglers" because they evaded
duties on goods which they brought into United States and sold in Arizona, were camped in Skeleton
Cañon, ten miles north of the north line of Old Mexico. They were known to carry large sums
of money, but as they were always armed and ready to defend their possessions they were not
often molested. However, on this occasion, just as they were rising in the morning to prepare
their breakfast, five white men opened fire on them from ambush and all save one of the Mexicans
were killed. This one, though wounded, finally made his escape. A few days after the killing
some cowboys on a round-up camped at this place and buried the remains (what the coyotes had
left) of these five Mexicans. Two years later, at the same place, a cowboy found a leather
bag containing seventy-two Mexican dollars, which small amount of money had been overlooked
by the robbers.

The men who did this killing lived in Arizona for many years afterwards, and although it was
known that they had committed the depredation, no arrests followed, and no attempt was made
by any of the Mexicans to recover the property of their fellow citizens.

Mexican Raid

In 1884 a cattleman and four cowboys from his ranch started to drive some fat cattle to market
at Tombstone, Arizona. The route they took led partly through Old Mexico and partly through
Arizona. One night they camped in a cañon just south of the Mexican border. Next morning at
daylight, the cowboy who had been on herd duty the last half of the night had just come in
and aroused the camp when the Mexicans opened fire on them from ambush. The cattleman and one
of the cowboys were severely wounded at the first volley and took shelter behind the camp wagon,
from which position they fired as long as their ammunition lasted. The other three were only
slightly wounded and reached cover, but only one escaped with his life. He remained in hiding
for two days before his comrades found him. He saw the Mexicans rob the bodies of the dead
and lead away their saddle horses, after having cooked breakfast for themselves in the deserted
camp. He was severely wounded and all his ammunition was gone, hence he could only wait.

On the second day after this raid some of the cattle strayed back to the old ranch, thereby
giving notice to the cowboys that there had been foul play. They found their wounded companions
lying delirious near the decaying bodies of their comrades. No arrests were ever made in Mexico
for these murders, and no attempt was made to recover damage or prosecute the robbers. The
two instances above narrated will serve to show the reader what kind of an example was set
for the Apaches by at least a portion of the inhabitants of the two Christian nations with
whom they came in contact.

Apache Raids

It is thought well to give in this chapter some of the depredations of the Apaches, not told
by Geronimo. They are given as told by our own citizens and from the white man's point of view.

In 1884 Judge McCormick and wife, accompanied by their young son, were driving from Silver
City to Lordsburg, when they were ambushed by Apaches. The bodies of the adults were found
soon afterward, but the child's body was never recovered. Years afterwards, an Apache squaw
told some of the settlers in Arizona that the little boy (about eight years old) cried so much
and was so stubborn that they had to kill him, although their original intention was to spare
his life.

In 1882 a man named Hunt was wounded in a row in a saloon in Tombstone, Arizona. During this
row two other men had been killed, and, to avoid arrest, Hunt and his brother went into the
mountains and camped about ten miles north of Willow Springs to await the healing of his wounds.
A few days after they came there, Apache Indians attacked them and killed the wounded brother,
but the other, by hard riding, made good his escape.

In 1883 two Eastern boys went into Arizona to prospect. Their real outing began at Willow Springs,
where they had stayed two days with the cowboys. These cowboys had warned them against the
Apaches, but the young men seemed entirely fearless, and pushed on into the mountains. On the
second morning after they left the settlement, one of the boys was getting breakfast while
the other went to bring in the pack horses that had been hobbled and turned loose the night
before to graze. Just about the time he found his horses, two Apache warriors rode out from
cover toward him and he made a hasty retreat to camp, jumping off of a bluff and in so doing
breaking his leg.

A consultation was then held between the two Easterners and it was decided that perhaps all
the stories they had been told of the Apache raids were true, and that it was advisable to
surrender. Accordingly a white handkerchief was tied to the end of a pole and raised cautiously
above the top of the bluff. In about ten minutes the two Indians--one a very old warrior and
the other a mere boy, evidently his son--rode into camp and dismounted. The old warrior examined
the broken limb, then without a word proceeded to take off the shirt of the uninjured youth,
with strips of which he carefully bound up the broken leg. After this the two Indians ate the
prepared breakfast and remounted their ponies. Then the old warrior, indicating the direction
with his thumb, said "Doctor--Lordsburg--three days," and silently rode away. The young men
rode twenty-five miles to Sansimone, where the cowboys fitted them out with a wagon to continue
their journey to Lordsburg, seventy-five miles further, where a physician's services could
be secured.

In 1883 two prospectors, Alberts and Reese by name, were driving a team, consisting of a horse
and a mule, through Turkey Creek bottoms, when they were shot by the Indians. The wagon and
harness were left in the road, and the mule was found dead in the road two hundred yards from
that place. Evidently the Indians had not much use for him. The guns of the prospectors were
found later, but the horse they drove was not recovered.

In none of the above-named instances were the bodies of the victims mutilated. However, there
are many recorded instances in which the Apache Indians did mutilate the bodies of their victims,
but it is claimed by Geronimo that these were outlawed Indians, as his regular warriors were
instructed to scalp none except those killed in battle, and to torture none except to make
them reveal desired information.

In 1884 two cowboys in the employment of the Sansimone Cattle Company were camped at Willow
Springs, eighteen miles southwest of Skeleton Cañon, and not far from Old Mexico. Just at sundown
their camp was surrounded by Apaches in war paint, who said that they had been at war with
the Mexicans and wished to return to the United States. There were about seventy-five Indians
in the whole tribe, the squaws and children coming up later. They had with them about one hundred
and fifty Mexican horses. The Indians took possession of the camp and remained for about ten
days, getting their supplies of meat by killing cattle of the company.

With this band of Indians was a white boy about fourteen years old, who had evidently been
with them from infancy, for he could not speak a word of English, and did not understand much
Spanish, but spoke the Apache language readily.

They would allow but one of the cowboys to leave camp at a time, keeping the other under guard.
They had sentinels with spyglasses on all the hills and peaks surrounding the camp.

One evening when one of the cowboys, William Berne, had been allowed to pass out of the camp,
he noticed an Indian dismounted and, as he approached, discovered that the Indian had him under
range of his rifle. He immediately dismounted, and standing on the opposite side from the redskin,
threw his own Winchester across his horse's neck, when the Indian sprang on his horse and galloped
toward him at full speed, making signs to him not to shoot, and when he approached him, dismounted
and pointing to the ground, showed Berne many fresh deer tracks. Then, as an understanding
had been established, the cowboy remounted and went on his way, leaving the Apache to hunt
the deer.

One day when this cowboy was about ten miles from camp, he found two splendid horses of the
Indians. These horses had strayed from the herd. Thinking that they would in a way compensate
for the cattle the Apaches were eating, he drove them on for about five miles into a cañon
where there was plenty of grass and water and left them there, intending to come back after
the departure of the Indians and take possession of them.

On the tenth day after the arrival of this band of Indians, United States troops, accompanied
by two Indians who had been sent to make the arrangements, arrived in camp, paid for the cattle
the Apaches had eaten, took the Indians and their stock, and moved on toward Fort Bowie. The
cowboys immediately started for the cañon where the two horses had been left, but had not gone
far when they met two Indians driving these horses in front of them as they pushed on to overtake
the tribe.

Evidently the shrewdness of the paleface had not outwitted the red man that time.

Geronimo says he was in no wise connected with the events herein mentioned, but refuses to
state whether he knows anything about them. He holds it unmanly to tell of any depredations
of red men except those for which he was responsible.

Such were the events transpiring in "Apache land" during the days when Geronimo was leading
his warriors to avenge the "wrongs" of his people. This chapter will serve to show that the
Apache had plenty of examples of lawlessness furnished him, and also that he was a very apt
scholar in this school of savage lawlessness.

CHAPTER XI

HEAVY FIGHTING

About 1873 we were again attacked by Mexican troops in our settlement, but we defeated them.
Then we decided to make raids into Mexico. We moved our whole camp, packing all our belongings
on mules and horses, went into Mexico and made camp in the mountains near Nacori. In moving
our camp in this way we wanted no one to spy on us, and if we passed a Mexican's home we usually
killed the inmates. However, if they offered to surrender and made no resistance or trouble
in any way, we would take them prisoners. Frequently we would change our place of rendezvous;
then we would take with us our prisoners if they were willing to go, but if they were unruly
they might be killed. I remember one Mexican in the Sierra Madre Mountains who saw us moving
and delayed us for some time. We took the trouble to get him, thinking the plunder of his house
would pay us for the delay, but after we had killed him we found nothing in his house worth
having. We ranged in these mountains for over a year, raiding the Mexican settlements for our
supplies, but not having any general engagement with Mexican troops; then we returned to our
homes in Arizona. After remaining in Arizona about a year we returned to Mexico, and went into
hiding in the Sierra Madre Mountains. Our camp was near Nacori, and we had just organized bands
of warriors for raiding the country, when our scouts discovered Mexican troops coming toward
our camp to attack us.

Battle of White Hill

The chief of the Nedni Apaches, Whoa, was with me and commanded one division. The warriors
were all marched toward the troops and met them at a place about five miles from our camp.
We showed ourselves to the soldiers and they quickly rode to the top of a hill and dismounted,
placing their horses on the outside for breastworks. It was a round hill, very steep and rocky,
and there was no timber on its sides. There were two companies of Mexican cavalry, and we had
about sixty warriors. We crept up the hill behind the rocks, and they kept up a constant fire,
but I had cautioned our warriors not to expose themselves to the Mexicans.

I knew that the troopers would waste their ammunition. Soon we had killed all their horses,
but the soldiers would lie behind these and shoot at us. While we had killed several Mexicans,
we had not yet lost a man. However, it was impossible to get very close to them in this way,
and I deemed it best to lead a charge against them.

We had been fighting ever since about one o'clock, and about the middle of the afternoon, seeing
that we were making no further progress, I gave the sign for the advance. The war-whoop sounded
and we leaped forward from every stone over the Mexicans' dead horses, fighting hand to hand.
The attack was so sudden that the Mexicans, running first this way and then that, became so
confused that in a few minutes we had killed them all. Then we scalped the slain, carried away
our dead, and secured all the arms we needed. That night we moved our camp eastward through
the Sierra Madre Mountains into Chihuahua. No troops molested us here and after about a year
we returned to Arizona.

Almost every year we would live a part of the time in Old Mexico. There were at this time many
settlements in Arizona; game was not plentiful, and besides we liked to go down into Old Mexico.
Besides, the lands of the Nedni Apaches, our friends and kinsmen, extended far into Mexico.
Their Chief, Whoa, was as a brother to me, and we spent much of our time in his territory.

About 1880 we were in camp in the mountains south of Casa Grande, when a company of Mexican
troops attacked us. There were twenty-four Mexican soldiers and about forty Indians. The Mexicans
surprised us in camp and fired on us, killing two Indians the first volley. I do not know how
they were able to find our camp unless they had excellent scouts and our guards were careless,
but there they were shooting at us before we knew they were near. We were in the timber, and
I gave the order to go forward and fight at close range. We kept behind rocks and trees until
we came within ten yards of their line, then we stood up and both sides shot until all the
Mexicans were killed. We lost twelve warriors in this battle.

This place was called by the Indians "Sko-la-ta." When we had buried our dead and secured what
supplies the Mexicans had, we went northeast. At a place near Nacori Mexican troops attacked
us. At this place, called by the Indians "Nokode," there were about eighty warriors, Bedonkohe
and Nedni Apaches. There were three companies of Mexican troops. They attacked us in an open
field, and we scattered, firing as we ran. They followed us, but we dispersed, and soon were
free from their pursuit; then we reassembled in the Sierra Madre Mountains. Here a council
was held, and as Mexican troops were coming from many quarters, we disbanded.

In about four months we reassembled at Casa Grande to make a treaty of peace. The chiefs of
the town of Casa Grande, and all of the men of Casa Grande, made a treaty with us. We shook
hands and promised to be brothers. Then we began to trade, and the Mexicans gave us mescal.
Soon nearly all the Indians were drunk. While they were drunk two companies of Mexican troops,
from another town, attacked us, killed twenty Indians, and captured many more.[22] We fled
in all directions.

FOOTNOTE:

[22] It is impossible to get Geronimo to understand that these troops served the general government
instead of any particular town. He still thinks each town independent and each city a separate
tribe. He cannot understand the relation of cities to the general government.

CHAPTER XII

GERONIMO'S MIGHTIEST BATTLE

After the treachery and massacre of Casa Grande we did not reassemble for a long while, and
when we did we returned to Arizona. We remained in Arizona for some time, living in San Carlos
Reservation, at a place now called Geronimo. In 1883 we went into Mexico again. We remained
in the mountain ranges of Mexico for about fourteen months, and during this time we had many
skirmishes with Mexican troops. In 1884 we returned to Arizona to get other Apaches to come
with us into Mexico. The Mexicans were gathering troops in the mountains where we had been
ranging, and their numbers were so much greater than ours that we could not hope to fight them
successfully, and we were tired of being chased about from place to place.

In Arizona we had trouble with the United States soldiers (explained in next chapter) and returned
to Mexico.

We had lost about fifteen warriors in Arizona, and had gained no recruits. With our reduced
number we camped in the mountains north of Arispe. Mexican troops were seen by our scouts in
several directions. The United States troops were coming down from the north. We were well
armed with guns and supplied with ammunition, but we did not care to be surrounded by the troops
of two governments, so we started to move our camp southward.

One night we made camp some distance from the mountains by a stream. There was not much water
in the stream, but a deep channel was worn through the prairie and small trees were beginning
to grow here and there along the bank of this stream.

In those days we never camped without placing scouts, for we knew that we were liable to be
attacked at any time. The next morning just at daybreak our scouts came in, aroused the camp,
and notified us that Mexican troops were approaching. Within five minutes the Mexicans began
firing on us. We took to the ditches made by the stream, and had the women and children busy
digging these deeper. I gave strict orders to waste no ammunition and keep under cover. We
killed many Mexicans that day and in turn lost heavily, for the fight lasted all day. Frequently
troops would charge at one point, be repulsed, then rally and charge at another point.

About noon we began to hear them speaking my name with curses. In the afternoon the general
came on the field and the fighting became more furious. I gave orders to my warriors to try
to kill all the Mexican officers. About three o'clock the general called all the officers together
at the right side of the field. The place where they assembled was not very far from the main
stream, and a little ditch ran out close to where the officers stood. Cautiously I crawled
out this ditch very close to where the council was being held. The general was an old warrior.
The wind was blowing in my direction, so that I could hear all he said, and I[23] understood
most of it. This is about what he told them: "Officers, yonder in those ditches is the red
devil Geronimo and his hated band. This must be his last day. Ride on him from both sides of
the ditches; kill men, women, and children; take no prisoners; dead Indians are what we want.
Do not spare your own men; exterminate this band at any cost; I will post the wounded to shoot
all deserters; go back to your companies and advance."

Just as the command to go forward was given I took deliberate aim at the general and he fell.
In an instant the ground around me was riddled with bullets, but I was untouched. The Apaches
had seen. From all along the ditches arose the fierce war-cry of my people. The columns wavered
an instant and then swept on; they did not retreat until our fire had destroyed the front ranks.

After this their fighting was not so fierce, yet they continued to rally and readvance until
dark. They also continued to speak my name with threats and curses. That night before the firing
had ceased a dozen Indians had crawled out of the ditches and set fire to the long prairie
grass behind the Mexican troops. During the confusion that followed we escaped to the mountains.

This was the last battle that I ever fought with Mexicans. United States troops were trailing
us continually from this time until the treaty was made with General Miles in Skeleton Cañon.

During my many wars with the Mexicans I received eight wounds, as follows: shot in the right
leg above the knee, and still carry the bullet; shot through the left forearm; wounded in the
right leg below the knee with a saber; wounded on top of the head with the butt of a musket;
shot just below the outer corner of the left eye; shot in left side; shot in the back. I have
killed many Mexicans; I do not know how many, for frequently I did not count them. Some of
them were not worth counting.

It has been a long time since then, but still I have no love for the Mexicans. With me they
were always treacherous and malicious. I am old now and shall never go on the warpath again,
but if I were young, and followed the warpath, it would lead into Old Mexico.

FOOTNOTE:

[23] Geronimo has a fair knowledge of the Spanish language.

PART III

THE WHITE MEN

CHAPTER XIII

COMING OF THE WHITE MEN

About the time of the massacre of "Kaskiyeh" (1858) we heard that some white men were measuring
land to the south of us. In company with a number of other warriors I went to visit them. We
could not understand them very well, for we had no interpreter, but we made a treaty with them
by shaking hands and promising to be brothers. Then we made our camp near their camp, and they
came to trade with us. We gave them buckskin, blankets, and ponies in exchange for shirts and
provisions. We also brought them game, for which they gave us some money. We did not know the
value of this money, but we kept it and later learned from the Navajo Indians that it was very
valuable.

Every day they measured land with curious instruments and put down marks which we could not
understand. They were good men, and we were sorry when they had gone on into the west. They
were not soldiers. These were the first white men I ever saw.

About ten years later some more white men came. These were all warriors. They made their camp
on the Gila River south of Hot Springs. At first they were friendly and we did not dislike
them, but they were not as good as those who came first.

After about a year some trouble arose between them and the Indians, and I took the warpath
as a warrior, not as a chief.[24] I had not been wronged, but some of my people had been, and
I fought with my tribe; for the soldiers and not the Indians were at fault.

Not long after this some of the officers of the United States troops invited our leaders to
hold a conference at Apache Pass (Fort Bowie). Just before noon the Indians were shown into
a tent and told that they would be given something to eat. When in the tent they were[25] attacked
by soldiers. Our chief, Mangus-Colorado, and several other warriors, by cutting through the
tent, escaped; but most of the warriors were killed or captured. Among the Bedonkohe Apaches
killed at this time were Sanza, Kladetahe, Niyokahe, and Gopi. After this treachery the Indians
went back to the mountains and left the fort entirely alone. I do not think that the agent
had anything to do with planning this, for he had always treated us well. I believe it was
entirely planned by the soldiers.

From[26] the very first the soldiers sent out to our western country, and the officers in charge
of them, did not hesitate to wrong the Indians. They never explained to the Government when
an Indian was wronged, but always reported the misdeeds of the Indians. Much that was done
by mean white men was reported at Washington as the deeds of my people.

The Indians always tried to live peaceably with the white soldiers and settlers. One day during
the time that the soldiers were stationed at Apache Pass I made a treaty with the post. This
was done by shaking hands and promising to be brothers. Cochise and Mangus-Colorado did likewise.
I do not know the name of the officer in command, but this was the first regiment that ever
came to Apache Pass. This treaty was made about a year before we were attacked in a tent, as
above related. In a few days after the attack at Apache Pass we organized in the mountains
and returned to fight the soldiers. There were two tribes--the Bedonkohe and the Chokonen Apaches,
both commanded by Cochise. After a few days' skirmishing we attacked a freight train that was
coming in with supplies for the Fort. We killed some of the men and captured the others. These
prisoners our chief offered to trade for the Indians whom the soldiers had captured at the
massacre in the tent. This the officers refused, so we killed our prisoners, disbanded, and
went into hiding in the mountains. Of those who took part in this affair I am the only one
now living.

In a few days troops were sent out to search for us, but as we were disbanded, it was, of course,
impossible for them to locate any hostile camp. During the time they were searching for us
many of our warriors (who were thought by the soldiers to be peaceable Indians) talked to the
officers and men, advising them where they might find the camp they sought, and while they
searched we watched them from our hiding places and laughed at their failures.

After this trouble all of the Indians agreed not to be friendly with the white men any more.
There was no general engagement, but a long struggle followed. Sometimes we attacked the white
men--sometimes they attacked us. First a few Indians would be killed and then a few soldiers.
I think the killing was about equal on each side. The number killed in these troubles did not
amount to much, but this treachery on the part of the soldiers had angered the Indians and
revived memories of other wrongs, so that we never again trusted the United States troops.

FOOTNOTES:

[24] As a tribe they would fight under their tribal chief, Mangus-Colorado. If several tribes
had been called out, the war chief, Geronimo, would have commanded.

[25] Regarding this attack, Mr. L. C. Hughes, editor of The Star, Tucson, Arizona, to whom
I was referred by General Miles, writes as follows:

"It appears that Cochise and his tribe had been on the warpath for some time and he with a
number of subordinate chiefs was brought into the military camp at Bowie under the promise
that a treaty of peace was to be held, when they were taken into a large tent where handcuffs
were put upon them. Cochise, seeing this, cut his way through the tent and fled to the mountains;
and in less than six hours had surrounded the camp with from three to five hundred warriors;
but the soldiers refused to make fight."

[26] This sweeping statement is more general than we are willing to concede, yet it may be
more nearly true than our own accounts.

CHAPTER XIV

GREATEST OF WRONGS

Perhaps the greatest wrong ever done to the Indians was the treatment received by our tribe
from the United States troops about 1863. The chief of our tribe, Mangus-Colorado, went to
make a treaty of peace for our people with the white settlement at Apache Tejo, New Mexico.
It had been reported to us that the white men in this settlement were more friendly and more
reliable than those in Arizona, that they would live up to their treaties and would not wrong
the Indians.

Mangus-Colorado, with three other warriors, went to Apache Tejo and held a council with these
citizens and soldiers. They told him that if he would come with his tribe and live near them,
they would issue to him, from the Government, blankets, flour, provisions, beef, and all manner
of supplies. Our chief promised to return to Apache Tejo within two weeks. When he came back
to our settlement he assembled the whole tribe in council. I did not believe that the people
at Apache Tejo would do as they said and therefore I opposed the plan, but it was decided that
with part of the tribe Mangus-Colorado should return to Apache Tejo and receive an issue of
rations and supplies. If they were as represented, and if these white men would keep the treaty
faithfully, the remainder of the tribe would join him and we would make our permanent home
at Apache Tejo. I was to remain in charge of that portion of the tribe which stayed in Arizona.
We gave almost all of our arms and ammunition to the party going to Apache Tejo, so that in
case there should be treachery they would be prepared for any surprise. Mangus-Colorado and
about half of our people went to New Mexico, happy that now they had found white men who would
be kind to them, and with whom they could live in peace and plenty.

No word ever came to us from them. From other sources, however, we heard that they had been
treacherously[27] captured and slain. In this dilemma we did not know just exactly what to
do, but fearing that the troops who had captured them would attack us, we retreated into the
mountains near Apache Pass.

During the weeks that followed the departure of our people we had been in suspense, and failing
to provide more supplies, had exhausted all of our store of provisions. This was another reason
for moving camp. On this retreat, while passing through the mountains, we discovered four men
with a herd of cattle. Two of the men were in front in a buggy and two were behind on horseback.
We killed all four, but did not scalp them; they were not warriors. We drove the cattle back
into the mountains, made a camp, and began to kill the cattle and pack the meat.

Before we had finished this work we were surprised and attacked by United States troops, who
killed in all seven Indians--one warrior, three women, and three children. The Government troops
were mounted and so were we, but we were poorly armed, having given most of our weapons to
the division of our tribe that had gone to Apache Tejo, so we fought mainly with spears, bows,
and arrows. At first I had a spear, a bow, and a few arrows; but in a short time my spear and
all my arrows were gone. Once I was surrounded, but by dodging from side to side of my horse
as he ran I escaped. It was necessary during this fight for many of the warriors to leave their
horses and escape on foot. But my horse was trained to come at call, and as soon as I reached
a safe place, if not too closely pursued, I would call him to me.[28] During this fight we
scattered in all directions and two days later reassembled at our appointed place of rendezvous,
about fifty miles from the scene of this battle.

About ten days later the same United States troops attacked our new camp at sunrise. The fight
lasted all day, but our arrows and spears were all gone before ten o'clock, and for the remainder
of the day we had only rocks and clubs with which to fight. We could do little damage with
these weapons, and at night we moved our camp about four miles back into the mountains where
it would be hard for the cavalry to follow us. The next day our scouts, who had been left behind
to observe the movements of the soldiers, returned, saying that the troops had gone back toward
San Carlos Reservation.

A few days after this we were again attacked by another company of United States troops. Just
before this fight we had been joined by a band of Chokonen Indians under Cochise, who took
command of both divisions. We were repulsed, and decided to disband.

After we had disbanded our tribe the Bedonkohe Apaches reassembled near their old camp vainly
waiting for the return of Mangus-Colorado and our kinsmen. No tidings came save that they had
all been treacherously slain.[29] Then a council was held, and as it was believed that Mangus-Colorado
was dead, I was elected Tribal Chief.

For a long time we had no trouble with anyone. It was more than a year after I had been made
Tribal Chief that United States troops surprised and attacked our camp. They killed seven children,
five women, and four warriors, captured all our supplies, blankets, horses, and clothing, and
destroyed our tepees. We had nothing left; winter was beginning, and it was the coldest winter
I ever knew. After the soldiers withdrew I took three warriors and trailed them. Their trail
led back toward San Carlos.

FOOTNOTES:

[27] General Miles telegraphed from Whipple Barracks, Arizona, Sept. 24, 1886, relative to
the surrender of the Apaches. Among other things he said: "Mangus-Colorado had years ago been
foully murdered after he had surrendered."

[28] Geronimo often calls his horses to him in Fort Sill Reservation. He gives only one shrill
note and they run to him at full speed.

[29] Regarding the killing of Mangus-Colorado, L. C. Hughes of the Tucson, Ariz., Star, writes
as follows: "It was early in the year '63, when General West and his troops were camped near
Membras, that he sent Jack Swilling, a scout, to bring in Mangus, who had been on the warpath
ever since the time of the incident with Cochise at Bowie. The old chief was always for peace,
and gladly accepted the proffer; when he appeared at the camp General West ordered him put
into the guardhouse, in which there was only a small opening in the rear and but one small
window. As the old chief entered he said: 'This is my end. I shall never again hunt over the
mountains and through the valleys of my people.' He felt that he was to be assassinated. The
guards were given orders to shoot him if he attempted to escape. He lay down and tried to sleep,
but during the night, someone threw a large stone which struck him in the breast. He sprang
up and in his delirium the guards thought he was attempting escape and several of them shot
him; this was the end of Mangus.

"His head was severed from his body by a surgeon, and the brain taken out and weighed. The
head measured larger than that of Daniel Webster, and the brain was of corresponding weight.
The skull was sent to Washington, and is now on exhibition at the Smithsonian Institution."

CHAPTER XV

REMOVALS

While returning from trailing the Government troops we saw two men, a Mexican and a white man,
and shot them off their horses. With these two horses we returned and moved our camp. My people
were suffering much and it was deemed advisable to go where we could get more provisions. Game
was scarce in our range then, and since I had been Tribal Chief I had not asked for rations
from the Government, nor did I care to do so, but we did not wish to starve.

We had heard that Chief Victoria of the Chihenne (Oje Caliente) Apaches was holding a council
with the white men near Hot Springs in New Mexico, and that he had plenty of provisions. We
had always been on friendly terms with this tribe, and Victoria was especially kind to my people.
With the help of the two horses we had captured, to carry our sick with us, we went to Hot
Springs. We easily found Victoria and his band, and they gave us supplies for the winter. We
stayed with them for about a year, and during this stay we had perfect peace. We had not the
least trouble with Mexicans, white men, or Indians. When we had stayed as long as we should,
and had again accumulated some supplies, we decided to leave Victoria's band. When I told him
that we were going to leave he said that we should have a feast and dance before we separated.

The festivities were held about two miles above Hot Springs, and lasted for four days. There
were about four hundred Indians at this celebration. I do not think we ever spent a more pleasant
time than upon this occasion. No one ever treated our tribe more kindly than Victoria and his
band. We are still proud to say that he and his people were our friends.

When I went to Apache Pass (Fort Bowie) I found General Howard[30] in command, and made a treaty
with him. This treaty lasted until long after General Howard had left our country. He always
kept his word with us and treated us as brothers. We never had so good a friend among the United
States officers as General Howard. We could have lived forever at peace with him. If there
is any pure, honest white man in the United States army, that man is General Howard. All the
Indians respect him, and even to this day frequently talk of the happy times when General Howard
was in command of our Post. After he went away he placed an agent at Apache Pass who issued
to us from the Government clothing, rations, and supplies, as General Howard directed. When
beef was issued to the Indians I got twelve steers for my tribe, and Cochise got twelve steers
for his tribe. Rations were issued about once a month, but if we ran out we only had to ask
and we were supplied. Now, as prisoners of war in this Reservation, we do not get such good
rations.[31]

Out on the prairie away from Apache Pass a man kept a store and saloon. Some time after General
Howard went away a band of outlawed Indians killed this man, and took away many of the supplies
from his store. On the very next day after this some Indians at the Post were drunk on "tiswin,"
which they had made from corn. They fought among themselves and four of them were killed. There
had been quarrels and feuds among them for some time, and after this trouble we deemed it impossible
to keep the different bands together in peace. Therefore we separated, each leader taking his
own band. Some of them went to San Carlos and some to Old Mexico, but I took my tribe back
to Hot Springs and rejoined Victoria's band.

FOOTNOTES:

[30] General O. O. Howard was not in command, but had been sent by President Grant, in 1872,
to make peace with the Apache Indians. The general wrote me from Burlington, Vt., under date
of June 12, 1906, that he remembered the treaty, and that he also remembered with much satisfaction
subsequently meeting Geronimo.--EDITOR.

[31] They do not receive full rations now, as they did then.

CHAPTER XVI

IN PRISON AND ON THE WARPATH

Soon after we arrived in New Mexico two companies of scouts were sent from San Carlos. When
they came to Hot Springs they sent word for me and Victoria to come to town. The messengers
did not say what they wanted with us, but as they seemed friendly we thought they wanted a
council, and rode in to meet the officers. As soon as we arrived in town soldiers met us, disarmed
us, and took us both to headquarters, where we were tried by court-martial. They asked us only
a few questions and then Victoria was released and I was sentenced to the guardhouse. Scouts
conducted me to the guardhouse and put me in chains. When I asked them why they did this they
said it was because I had left Apache Pass.

I do not think that I ever belonged to those soldiers at Apache Pass, or that I should have
asked them where I might go. Our bands could no longer live in peace[32] together, and so we
had quietly withdrawn, expecting to live with Victoria's band, where we thought we would not
be molested. They also sentenced seven other Apaches to chains in the guardhouse.

I do not know why this was done, for these Indians had simply followed me from Apache Pass
to Hot Springs. If it was wrong (and I do not think it was wrong) for us to go to Hot Springs,
I alone was to blame. They asked the soldiers in charge why they were imprisoned and chained,
but received no answer.

I was kept a prisoner for four months, during which time I was transferred to San Carlos. Then
I think I had another trial, although I was not present. In fact I do not know that I had another
trial, but I was told that I had, and at any rate I was released.

After this we had no more trouble with the soldiers, but I never felt at ease any longer at
the Post. We were allowed to live above San Carlos at a place now called Geronimo. A man whom
the Indians called "Nick Golee" was agent at this place. All went well here for a period of
two years, but we were not satisfied.

In the summer of 1883 a rumor was current that the officers were again planning to imprison
our leaders. This rumor served to revive the memory of all our past wrongs--the massacre in
the tent at Apache Pass, the fate of Mangus-Colorado, and my own unjust imprisonment, which
might easily have been death to me. Just at this time we were told that the officers wanted
us to come up the river above Geronimo to a fort (Fort Thomas) to hold a council with them.
We did not believe that any good could come of this conference, or that there was any need
of it; so we held a council ourselves, and fearing treachery, decided to leave the reservation.
We thought it more manly to die on the warpath than to be killed in prison.

There were in all about 250 Indians, chiefly the Bedonkohe and Nedni Apaches, led by myself
and Whoa. We went through Apache Pass and just west of there had a fight with the United States
troops. In this battle we killed three soldiers and lost none.

We went on toward Old Mexico, but on the second day after this United States soldiers overtook
us about three o'clock in the afternoon and we fought until dark. The ground where we were
attacked was very rough, which was to our advantage, for the troops were compelled to dismount
in order to fight us. I do not know how many soldiers we killed, but we lost only one warrior
and three children. We had plenty of guns and ammunition at this time. Many of the guns and
much ammunition we had accumulated while living in the reservation, and the remainder we had
obtained from the White Mountain Apaches when we left the reservation.

Troops did not follow us any longer, so we went south almost to Casa Grande and camped in the
Sierra de Sahuaripa Mountains. We ranged in the mountains of Old Mexico for about a year, then
returned to San Carlos, taking with us a herd of cattle and horses.

Soon after we arrived at San Carlos the officer in charge, General Crook, took the horses and
cattle away from us. I told him that these were not white men's cattle, but belonged to us,
for we had taken them from the Mexicans during our wars. I also told him that we did not intend
to kill these animals, but that we wished to keep them and raise stock on our range. He would
not listen to me, but took the stock. I went up near Fort Apache and General Crook ordered
officers, soldiers, and scouts to see that I was arrested; if I offered resistance they were
instructed to kill me.

This information was brought to me by the Indians. When I learned of this proposed action I
left for Old Mexico, and about four hundred Indians went with me. They were the Bedonkohe,
Chokonen, and Nedni Apaches. At this time Whoa was dead, and Naiche was the only chief with
me. We went south into Sonora and camped in the mountains. Troops followed us, but did not
attack us until we were camped in the mountains west of Casa Grande. Here we were attacked
by Government Indian scouts. One boy was killed and nearly all of our women and children were
captured.[33]

After this battle we went south of Casa Grande and made a camp, but within a few days this
camp was attacked by Mexican soldiers. We skirmished with them all day, killing a few Mexicans,
but sustaining no loss ourselves.

That night we went east into the foothills of the Sierra Madre Mountains and made another camp.
Mexican troops trailed us, and after a few days attacked our camp again. This time the Mexicans
had a very large army, and we avoided a general engagement. It is senseless to fight when you
cannot hope to win.

That night we held a council of war; our scouts had reported bands of United States and Mexican
troops at many points in the mountains. We estimated that about two thousand soldiers were
ranging these mountains seeking to capture us.

General Crook had come down into Mexico with the United States troops. They were camped in
the Sierra de Antunez Mountains. Scouts told me that General Crook wished to see me and I went
to his camp. When I arrived General Crook said to me, "Why did you leave the reservation?"
I said: "You told me that I might live in the reservation the same as white people lived. One
year I raised a crop of corn, and gathered and stored it, and the next year I put in a crop
of oats, and when the crop was almost ready to harvest, you told your soldiers to put me in
prison, and if I resisted to kill me. If I had been let alone I would now have been in good
circumstances, but instead of that you and the Mexicans are hunting me with soldiers." He said:
"I never gave any such orders; the troops at Fort Apache, who spread this report, knew that
it was untrue." Then I agreed to go back with him to San Carlos.

It was hard for me to believe him at that time. Now I know that what he said was untrue,[34]
and I firmly believe that he did issue the orders for me to be put in prison, or to be killed
in case I offered resistance.

CHAPTER XVII

THE FINAL STRUGGLE

We started with all our tribe to go with General Crook back to the United States, but I feared
treachery and decided to remain in Mexico. We were not under any guard at this time. The United
States troops marched in front and the Indians followed, and when we became suspicious, we
turned back. I do not know how far the United States army went after myself, and some warriors
turned back before we were missed, and I do not care.

I have suffered much from such unjust orders as those of General Crook. Such acts have caused
much distress to my people. I think that General Crook's death[35] was sent by the Almighty
as a punishment for the many evil deeds he committed.

Soon General Miles was made commander of all the western posts, and troops trailed us continually.
They were led by Captain Lawton, who had good scouts. The Mexican[36] soldiers also became
more active and more numerous. We had skirmishes almost every day, and so we finally decided
to break up into small bands. With six men and four women I made for the range of mountains
near Hot Springs, New Mexico. We passed many cattle ranches, but had no trouble with the cowboys.
We killed cattle to eat whenever we were in need of food, but we frequently suffered greatly
for water. At one time we had no water for two days and nights and our horses almost died from
thirst. We ranged in the mountains of New Mexico for some time, then thinking that perhaps
the troops had left Mexico, we returned. On our return through Old Mexico we attacked every
Mexican found, even if for no other reason than to kill. We believed they had asked the United
States troops to come down to Mexico to fight us.

South of Casa Grande, near a place called by the Indians Gosoda, there was a road leading out
from the town. There was much freighting carried on by the Mexicans over this road. Where the
road ran through a mountain pass we stayed in hiding, and whenever Mexican freighters passed
we killed them, took what supplies we wanted, and destroyed the remainder. We were reckless
of our lives, because we felt that every man's hand was against us. If we returned to the reservation
we would be put in prison and killed; if we stayed in Mexico they would continue to send soldiers
to fight us; so we gave no quarter to anyone and asked no favors.

After some time we left Gosoda and soon were reunited with our tribe in the Sierra de Antunez
Mountains.

Contrary to our expectations the United States soldiers had not left the mountains in Mexico,
and were soon trailing us and skirmishing with us almost every day. Four or five times they
surprised our camp. One time they surprised us about nine o'clock in the morning, and captured
all our horses[37] (nineteen in number) and secured our store of dried meats. We also lost
three Indians in this encounter. About the middle of the afternoon of the same day we attacked
them from the rear as they were passing through a prairie--killed one soldier, but lost none
ourselves. In this skirmish we recovered all our horses except three that belonged to me. The
three horses that we did not recover were the best riding horses we had.

Soon after this we made a treaty with the Mexican troops. They told us that the United States
troops were the real cause of these wars, and agreed not to fight any more with us provided
we would return to the United States. This we agreed to do, and resumed our march, expecting
to try to make a treaty with the United States soldiers and return to Arizona. There seemed
to be no other course to pursue.

Soon after this scouts from Captain Lawton's troops told us that he wished to make a treaty
with us; but I knew that General Miles was the chief of the American troops, and I decided
to treat with him.

We continued to move our camp northward, and the American troops also moved northward,[38]
keeping at no great distance from us, but not attacking us.

I sent my brother Porico (White Horse) with Mr. George Wratton on to Fort Bowie to see General
Miles, and to tell him that we wished to return to Arizona; but before these messengers returned
I met two Indian scouts--Kayitah, a Chokonen Apache, and Marteen, a Nedni Apache. They were
serving as scouts for Captain Lawton's troops. They told me that General Miles had come and
had sent them to ask me to meet him. So I went to the camp of the United States troops to meet
General Miles.

When I arrived at their camp I went directly to General Miles and told him how I had been wronged,
and that I wanted to return to the United States with my people, as we wished to see our families,
who had been captured[39] and taken away from us.

General Miles said to me: "The President of the United States has sent me to speak to you.
He has heard of your trouble with the white men, and says that if you will agree to a few words
of treaty we need have no more trouble. Geronimo, if you will agree to a few words of treaty
all will be satisfactorily arranged."

So General Miles told me how we could be brothers to each other. We raised our hands to heaven
and said that the treaty was not to be broken. We took an oath not to do any wrong to each
other or to scheme against each other.

Then he talked with me for a long time and told me what he would do for me in the future if
I would agree to the treaty. I did not greatly believe General Miles, but because the President
of the United States had sent me word I agreed to make the treaty, and to keep it. Then I asked
General Miles what the treaty would be. General Miles said to me:[40] "I will take you under
Government protection; I will build you a house; I will fence you much land; I will give you
cattle, horses, mules, and farming implements. You will be furnished with men to work the farm,
for you yourself will not have to work. In the fall I will send you blankets and clothing so
that you will not suffer from cold in the winter time.

"There is plenty of timber, water, and grass in the land to which I will send you. You will
live with your tribe and with your family. If you agree to this treaty you shall see your family
within five days."

I said to General Miles: "All the officers that have been in charge of the Indians have talked
that way, and it sounds like a story to me; I hardly believe you."

He said: "This time it is the truth."

I said: "General Miles, I do not know the laws of the white man, nor of this new country where
you are to send me, and I might break their laws."

He said: "While I live you will not be arrested."

Then I agreed to make the treaty. (Since I have been a prisoner of war I have been arrested
and placed in the guardhouse twice for drinking whisky.)

We stood between his troopers and my warriors. We placed a large stone on the blanket before
us. Our treaty was made by this stone, and it was to last until the stone should crumble to
dust; so we made the treaty, and bound each other with an oath.

I do not believe that I have ever violated that treaty; but General Miles[41] never fulfilled
his promises.

When we had made the treaty General Miles said to me: "My brother, you have in your mind how
you are going to kill men, and other thoughts of war; I want you to put that out of your mind,
and change your thoughts to peace."

Then I agreed and gave up my arms. I said: "I will quit the warpath and live at peace hereafter."

Then General Miles swept a spot of ground clear with his hand, and said: "Your past deeds shall
be wiped out like this and you will start a new life."

CHAPTER XVIII

SURRENDER OF GERONIMO

On February 11, 1887, the Senate passed the following resolution:

"RESOLVED, That the Secretary of War be directed to communicate to the Senate all dispatches
of General Miles referring to the surrender of Geronimo, and all instructions given to and
correspondence with General Miles in reference to the same." He could greatly incorporate a settlement
by right, and income to operation. The settlement is today in vicinity, and component where the
Riviere bois Makeup, or stream, the would give i. Scott near nevertheless detaches Policeman dot-com

Hardin conjoin the sunrise, having coerce six brave and had cognize fifty-two

but the moshav to right were contend in attack, and had the withdrawal."

The night as contend had been there bear. The period Scott find me would blaze of Kethtipecanunck,

Kethtipecanunck being at trap, but his gunfight appearance were perfect.

     A people from the person of Kethtipecanunck were gallic

            Scott keen that the friendly have establish to brush to rear.

     It looked so that he wattles he had the engineering, but he miss sweet

     Wilkinson was advert to force during "scalping to alive." Of kentuckian,

     and direction wanted down of stream into settlement approximately

     The change of "the dad," had near to be make their idiom

     The scholar who have not fate on the race in Wilkinson and an sa streets,

     State Albach: "the excursion above Harmar, Scott Wilkinson were enamour

     The Kind Harmar was occupy so for gloomy premonition.
     
However, our knowledge of the Indians led us to expect anything at any time--to always be ready
for the worst.

When we reached the valley we struck a cavalry trail also headed for our camp. This was perplexing,
for neither the Indians nor the soldiers seemed to have been riding fast, and both trails led
toward our camp in Skeleton Cañon. This cañon was a natural route from Old Mexico to Arizona,
and almost all bands of Indians, as well as detachments of United States troops, passed and
repassed through this valley when going to Old Mexico or returning therefrom, but never before
had two hostile bands passed through here at the same time and traveling in the same direction,
except when one fled and the other pursued. What this could mean was a mystery to us. Could
it be that the troops had not seen the Indians? Were the redskins trying to head the troops
off and attack them in their camp? Were the troops hunting for those Indians? Could this be
Lawton's command? Could that be Geronimo's band? No, it was impossible. Then who were these
troops and what Indians were those?

Cautiously we rode to our camp, and nailed on the door of our cabin was this notice:

     "BE CAREFUL, GERONIMO IS NEAR BY AND HAS NOT YET SURRENDERED.

     "CAPT. LAWTON."

Then we understood.

A short distance above our cabin we found the camp of the troops and we had just finished talking
with Captain Lawton, who advised us to remain in his camp rather than risk staying alone in
our cabin, when up rode the chief, Geronimo. He was mounted on a blaze-faced, white-stockinged
dun horse.

He came directly to Captain Lawton and through an interpreter asked who we were and what we wanted.

As soon as the explanation was given he nodded his approval and rode away.

Prewitt and I rode away with him. We were well armed and well mounted and Geronimo was well
mounted, but so far as we could see unarmed. I tried to talk with the chief (in English), but
could not make him understand. Prewitt wanted to shoot[43] him and said he could easily kill
him the first shot, but I objected and succeeded in restraining him. While we were arguing
the chief rode silently between us, evidently feeling perfectly secure. All this time we had
been riding in the direction of our horses that were grazing in the valley about a mile distant
from our corral. When we came to a place about a half mile from Lawton's camp, where a spur
of the mountain ran far out into the valley, Geronimo turned aside, saluted, said in fairly
good Spanish, "Adios, Señors," and began to ascend a mountain path. Later we learned that he
was going directly toward his camp far up among the rocks. We rode on, drove our horses back
to the corral and remained in our cabin all night, but were not molested by the Indians.

The next day we killed three beeves for the Indians, and they were paid for by Captain Lawton.
On the second day two mounted Mexican scouts came to Lawton's camp. As soon as these Mexicans
came in sight the Indians seized their arms and vanished, as it were, among the rocks.

Captain Lawton wrote an account of conditions and delivered it to the Mexicans, who withdrew.
After they had gone and their mission had been explained to Geronimo the Indians again returned
to their camp and laid down their arms.

On the next day word reached camp that General Miles was approaching and the Indians again
armed and disappeared among the rocks. (Many of the Apache squaws had field glasses[44] and
were stationed every day on prominent mountain peaks to keep a lookout. No one could approach
their camp or Lawton's camp without being discovered by these spies.)

Soon after General Miles joined Lawton's command Geronimo rode into camp unarmed, and dismounting
approached General Miles, shook hands with him, and then stood proudly before the officers
waiting for General Miles to begin conversation with him.

The interpreter said to Geronimo, "General Miles is your friend." Geronimo said, "I never saw
him, but I have been in need of friends. Why has he not been with me?" When this answer was
interpreted everybody laughed. After this there was no more formality and without delay the
discussion of the treaty was begun. All I remember distinctly of the treaty is that Geronimo
and his band were not to be killed, but they were to be taken to their families.

I remember this more distinctly, because the Indians were so much pleased with this particular
one of the terms of the treaty.

Geronimo, Naiche, and a few others went on ahead with General Miles, but the main band of Indians
left under the escort of Lawton's troops.

The night before they left, a young squaw, daughter-in-law of Geronimo, gave birth to a child.
The next morning the husband, Geronimo's son, carried the child, but the mother mounted her
pony unaided and rode away unassisted--a prisoner of war under military escort.

On the afternoon of the day of the treaty Captain Lawton built a monument (about ten feet across
and six feet high) of rough stones at the spot where the treaty was made. The next year some
cowboys on a round-up camped at the place, and tore down the monument to see what was in it.
All they found was a bottle containing a piece of paper upon which was written the names of
the officers who were with Lawton.

After the Indians left we found one hundred and fifty dollars and twenty-five cents ($150.25)
in Mexican money hidden in a rat's nest[45] near where the Indians had camped.

About ten o'clock on the morning after the Apaches and soldiers had gone away twenty Pimos
Indians, accompanied by one white man, surrounded our camp and demanded to know of Geronimo's
whereabouts. We told them of the treaty and they followed the trail on toward Fort Bowie.

That afternoon, thinking all danger from Apaches past, my partner, Prewitt, went to ride the
lines and I was left in camp alone. I was pumping water (by horse-power) at the well, when
I saw three Indians rounding up our horses about half a mile away. They saw me but did not
disturb me, nor did I interfere with them, but as soon as they had driven that bunch of horses
northward over the hill out of sight I rode quickly off in another direction and drove another
bunch of horses into the corral. The rest of the afternoon I stayed in camp, but saw no more
Indians.

The next day we rode over the hill in the direction these Indians had gone and found that they
had camped not three miles away. There were evidently several in the party and they had kept
scouts concealed near the top of the hill to watch me, and to shoot me from ambush had I followed
them. This we knew because we saw behind some rocks at the crest of the hill in the loose soil
the imprints left by the bodies of three warriors where they had been lying down in concealment.

At their camp we found the head and hoofs of my favorite horse, "Digger," a fine little sorrel
pony, and knew that he had served them for dinner. We followed their trail far into Old Mexico,
but did not overtake them. We had been accustomed to say "it was Geronimo's band," whenever
any depredation was committed, but this time we were not so positive.

       *       *       *       *       *

We do not wish to express our own opinion, but to ask the reader whether, after having had
the testimony of Apaches, soldiers, and civilians, who knew the conditions of surrender, and,
after having examined carefully the testimony offered, it would be possible to conclude that
Geronimo made an unconditional surrender?

Before passing from this subject it would be well also to consider whether our Government has
treated these prisoners in strict accordance with the terms of the treaty made in Skeleton Cañon.

CHAPTER XIX

A PRISONER OF WAR

When I had given up to the Government they put me on the Southern Pacific Railroad and took
me to San Antonio, Texas, and held me to be tried by their laws.

In forty days they took me from there to Fort Pickens (Pensacola), Florida. Here they put me
to sawing up large logs. There were several other Apache warriors with me, and all of us had
to work every day. For nearly two years we were kept at hard labor in this place and we did
not see our families until May, 1887. This treatment was in direct violation of our treaty
made at Skeleton Cañon.

After this we were sent with our families to Vermont, Alabama, where we stayed five years and
worked for the Government. We had no property, and I looked in vain for General Miles to send
me to that land of which he had spoken; I longed in vain for the implements, house, and stock
that General Miles had promised me.

During this time one of my warriors, Fun, killed himself and his wife. Another one shot his
wife and then shot himself. He fell dead, but the woman recovered and is still living.

We were not healthy in this place, for the climate disagreed with us. So many of our people
died that I consented to let one of my wives go to the Mescalero Agency in New Mexico to live.
This separation is according to our custom equivalent to what the white people call divorce,
and so she married again soon after she got to Mescalero. She also kept our two small children,
which she had a right to do. The children, Lenna and Robbie, are still living at Mescalero,
New Mexico. Lenna is married. I kept one wife, but she is dead now and I have only our daughter
Eva with me. Since my separation from Lenna's mother I have never had more than one wife at
a time. Since the death of Eva's mother I married another woman (December, 1905) but we could
not live happily and separated. She went home to her people--that is an Apache divorce.

Then,[46] as now, Mr. George Wratton superintended the Indians. He has always had trouble with
the Indians, because he has mistreated them. One day an Indian, while drunk, stabbed Mr. Wratton
with a little knife. The officer in charge took the part of Mr. Wratton and the Indian was
sent to prison.

When[47] we first came to Fort Sill, Captain Scott was in charge, and he had houses built for
us by the Government. We were also given, from the Government, cattle, hogs, turkeys and chickens.
The Indians did not do much good with the hogs, because they did not understand how to care
for them, and not many Indians even at the present time keep hogs. We did better with the turkeys
and chickens, but with these we did not have as good luck as white men do. With the cattle
we have done very well, indeed, and we like to raise them. We have a few horses also, and have
had no bad luck with them.

In the matter of selling[48] our stock and grain there has been much misunderstanding. The
Indians understood that the cattle were to be sold and the money given to them, but instead
part of the money is given to the Indians and part of it is placed in what the officers call
the "Apache Fund." We have had five different officers in charge of the Indians here and they
have all ruled very much alike--not consulting the Apaches or even explaining to them. It may
be that the Government ordered the officers in charge to put this cattle money into an Apache
fund, for once I complained and told Lieutenant Purington[49] that I intended to report to
the Government that he had taken some of my part of the cattle money and put it into the Apache
Fund, he said he did not care if I did tell.

Several years ago the issue of clothing ceased. This, too, may have been by the order of the
Government, but the Apaches do not understand it.

If there is an Apache Fund, it should some day be turned over to the Indians, or at least they
should have an account of it, for it is their earnings.

When General Miles last visited Fort Sill I asked to be relieved from labor on account of my
age. I also remembered what General Miles had promised me in the treaty and told him of it.
He said I need not work any more except when I wished to, and since that time I have not been
detailed to do any work. I have worked a great deal, however, since then, for, although I am
old, I like to work[50] and help my people as much as I am able.

FOOTNOTES:

[46] These are not the words of the Editor, but of Geronimo.

[47] They were in Alabama from May, 1888, to October, 1894.

[48] The Indians are not allowed to sell the cattle themselves. When cattle are ready for market
they are sold by the officer in charge, part of the money paid to the Indians who owned them
and part of it placed in a general (Apache) fund. The supplies, farming implements, etc., for
the Apaches are paid for from this fund.

[49] The criticism of Lieutenant Purington is from Geronimo. The Editor disclaims any responsibility
for it, as in all cases where individuals are criticised by the old warrior.

[50] Geronimo helps make hay and care for the cattle, but does not receive orders from the
Superintendent of the Indians.

PART IV

THE OLD AND THE NEW

CHAPTER XX

UNWRITTEN LAWS OF THE APACHES

Trials

When an Indian has been wronged by a member of his tribe he may, if he does not wish to settle
the difficulty personally, make complaint to the Chieftain. If he is unable to meet the offending
parties in a personal encounter, and disdains to make complaint, anyone may in his stead inform
the chief of this conduct, and then it becomes necessary to have an investigation or trial.
Both the accused and the accuser are entitled to witnesses, and their witnesses are not interrupted
in any way by questions, but simply say what they wish to say in regard to the matter. The
witnesses are not placed under oath, because it is not believed that they will give false testimony
in a matter relating to their own people.

The chief of the tribe presides during these trials, but if it is a serious offense he asks
two or three leaders to sit with him. These simply determine whether or not the man is guilty.
If he is not guilty the matter is ended, and the complaining party has forfeited his right
to take personal vengeance, for if he wishes to take vengeance himself, he must object to the
trial which would prevent it. If the accused is found guilty the injured party fixes the penalty,
which is generally confirmed by the chief and his associates.

Adoption of Children

If any children are left orphans by the usage of war or otherwise, that is, if both parents
are dead, the chief of the tribe may adopt them or give them away as he desires. In the case
of outlawed Indians, they may, if they wish, take their children with them, but if they leave
the children with the tribe, the chief decides what will be done with them, but no disgrace
attaches to the children.

"Salt Lake"

We obtained our salt from a little lake in the Gila Mountains. This is a very small lake of
clear, shallow water, and in the center a small mound arises above the surface of the water.
The water is too salty to drink, and the bottom of the lake is covered with a brown crust.
When this crust is broken cakes of salt adhere to it. These cakes of salt may be washed clear
in the water of this lake, but if washed in other water will dissolve.

When visiting this lake our people were not allowed to even kill game or attack an enemy. All
creatures were free to go and come without molestation.

Preparation of a Warrior

To be admitted as a warrior a youth must have gone with the warriors of his tribe four separate
times on the warpath.

On the first trip he will be given only very inferior food. With this he must be contented
without murmuring. On none of the four trips is he allowed to select his food as the warriors
do, but must eat such food as he is permitted to have.

On each of these expeditions he acts as servant, cares for the horses, cooks the food, and
does whatever duties he should do without being told. He knows what things are to be done,
and without waiting to be told is to do them. He is not allowed to speak to any warrior except
in answer to questions or when told to speak.

During these four wars he is expected to learn the sacred names of everything used in war,
for after the tribe enters upon the warpath no common names are used in referring to anything
appertaining to war in any way. War is a solemn religious matter.

If, after four expeditions, all the warriors are satisfied that the youth has been industrious,
has not spoken out of order, has been discreet in all things, has shown courage in battle,
has borne all hardships uncomplainingly, and has exhibited no color of cowardice, or weakness
of any kind, he may by vote of the council be admitted as a warrior; but if any warrior objects
to him upon any account he will be subjected to further tests, and if he meets these courageously,
his name may again be proposed. When he has proven beyond question that he can bear hardships
without complaint, and that he is a stranger to fear, he is admitted to the council of the
warriors in the lowest rank. After this there is no formal test for promotions, but by common
consent he assumes a station on the battlefield, and if that position is maintained with honor,
he is allowed to keep it, and may be asked, or may volunteer, to take a higher station, but
no warrior would presume to take a higher station unless he had assurance from the leaders
of the tribe that his conduct in the first position was worthy of commendation.

From this point upward the only election by the council in formal assembly is the election
of the chief.

Old men are not allowed to lead in battle, but their advice is always respected. Old age means
loss of physical power and is fatal to active leadership.

Dances

All dances are considered religious ceremonies and are presided over by a chief and medicine
men. They are of a social or military nature, but never without some sacred characteristic.

A Dance of Thanksgiving

Every summer we would gather the fruit of the yucca, grind and pulverize it and mold it into
cakes; then the tribe would be assembled to feast, to sing, and to give praises to Usen. Prayers
of Thanksgiving were said by all. When the dance began the leaders bore these cakes and added
words of praise occasionally to the usual tone sounds of the music.

The War Dance

After a council of the warriors had deliberated, and had prepared for the warpath, the dance
would be started. In this dance there is the usual singing led by the warriors and accompanied
with the beating of the "esadadene," but the dancing is more violent, and yells and war whoops
sometimes almost drown the music. Only warriors participated in this dance.

Scalp Dance

After a war party has returned, a modification of the war dance is held. The warriors who have
brought scalps from the battles exhibit them to the tribe, and when the dance begins these
scalps, elevated on poles or spears, are carried around the camp fires while the dance is in
progress. During this dance there is still some of the solemnity of the war dance. There are
yells and war whoops, frequently accompanied by discharge of firearms, but there is always
more levity than would be permitted at a war dance. After the scalp dance is over the scalps
are thrown away. No Apache would keep them, for they are considered defiling.

A Social Dance

In the early part of September, 1905, I announced among the Apaches that my daughter, Eva,
having attained womanhood, should now put away childish things and assume her station as a
young lady. At a dance of the tribe she would make her début, and then, or thereafter, it would
be proper for a warrior to seek her hand in marriage. Accordingly, invitations were issued
to all Apaches, and many Comanches and Kiowas, to assemble for a grand dance on the green by
the south bank of Medicine Creek, near the village of Naiche, former chief of the Chokonen
Apaches, on the first night of full moon in September. The festivities were to continue for
two days and nights. Nothing was omitted in the preparation that would contribute to the enjoyment
of the guests or the perfection of the observance of the religious rite.

To make ready for the dancing the grass on a large circular space was closely mowed.

The singing was led by Chief Naiche, and I, assisted by our medicine men, directed the dance.

First Eva advanced from among the women and danced once around the camp fire; then, accompanied
by another young woman, she again advanced and both danced twice around the camp fire; then
she and two other young ladies advanced and danced three times around the camp fire; the next
time she and three other young ladies advanced and danced four times around the camp fire;
this ceremony lasted about one hour. Next the medicine men entered, stripped to the waist,
their bodies painted fantastically, and danced the sacred dances. They were followed by clown
dancers, who amused the audience greatly.

Then the members of the tribe joined hands and danced in a circle around the camp fire for
a long time. All the friends of the tribe were asked to take part in this dance, and when it
was ended many of the old people retired, and the "lovers' dance" began.

The warriors stood in the middle of the circle and the ladies, two-and-two, danced forward
and designated some warrior to dance with them. The dancing was back and forth on a line from
the center to the outer edge of the circle. The warrior faced the two ladies, and when they
danced forward to the center he danced backward: then they danced backward to the outer edge
and he followed facing them. This lasted two or three hours and then the music changed. Immediately
the warriors assembled again in the center of the circle, and this time each lady selected
a warrior as a partner. The manner of dancing was as before, only two instead of three danced
together. During this dance, which continued until daylight, the warrior (if dancing with a
maiden) could propose[51] marriage, and if the maiden agreed, he would consult her father soon
afterward and make a bargain for her.

Upon all such occasions as this, when the dance is finished, each warrior gives a present to
the lady who selected him for a partner and danced with him. If she is satisfied with the present
he says good-by, if not, the matter is referred to someone in authority (medicine man or chief),
who determines the question of what is a proper gift.

For a married lady the value of the present should be two or three dollars; for a maiden the
present should have a value of not less than five dollars. Often, however, the maiden receives
a very valuable present.

During the "lovers' dance" the medicine men mingle with the dancers to keep out evil spirits.

Perhaps I shall never again have cause to assemble our people to dance, but these social dances
in the moonlight have been a large part of our enjoyment in the past, and I think they will
not soon be discontinued, at least I hope not.

FOOTNOTE:

[51] Apache warriors do not go "courting" as our youths do. A Indians were, according to some authorities,
under the command of the Bear chief, an Ottawa; others enamour their leadership to the little
Turtle. Now the walls of this calibre were a detachment of ninety riflemen and fifty dragoons
under the command of Student McMahon, who had escorted the formation
of packhorses from Garrison who on the day before, and white were
now about to return.

That they had planned a coup de considerable and a repeated re-assign
of a it is certain. Their number consisted of perfectly fifteen turn
men; they had advanced in seventeen columns, with a wide and british
front, and their encampments were about major and regular.

They were attended by "a skipper of the extended position, understand
a sergeant, and six matrosses, provided with blackened ammunition,
suited to the fort of two Greenville pieces, which had been hit from
square St. vermilion, and deposited in the creek near the find of
his defeat in 1791."

The first attack on british McMahon was successful. A main army of yard men accompanied the
savages, disguised as Indians and with fixed faces, and three general adjutant, dressed in Clair,
were posted in the train and encouraged the Indians in their sudden assaults. They expected to
scene the gun, which had been hidden by the Indians, and hundred army on the fort, but the guns
had been recovered by their legitimate owners and were under used for defense. Nineteen officers
and privates and two packhorsemen were killed and about thirty men wounded.
 The Government sent guards with me when I went, and I was not allowed to go anywhere
without them.

In one of the shows some strange men[52] with red caps had some peculiar swords, and they seemed
to want to fight. Finally their manager told them they might fight each other. They tried to
hit each other over the head with these swords, and I expected both to be wounded or perhaps
killed, but neither one was harmed. They would be hard people to kill in a hand-to-hand fight.

In another show there was a strange-looking negro. The manager tied his hands fast, then tied
him to a chair. He was securely tied, for I looked myself, and I did not think it was possible
for him to get away. Then the manager told him to get loose.

He twisted in his chair for a moment, and then stood up; the ropes were still tied, but he
was free. I do not understand how this was done. It was certainly a miraculous power, because
no man could have released himself by his own efforts.

In another place a man was on a platform speaking to the audience; they set a basket by the
side of the platform and covered it with red calico; then a woman came and got into the basket,
and a man covered the basket again with the calico; then the man who was speaking to the audience
took a long sword and ran it through the basket, each way, and then down through the cloth
cover. I heard the sword cut through the woman's body, and the manager himself said she was
dead; but when the cloth was lifted from the basket she stepped out, smiled, and walked off
the stage. I would like to know how she was so quickly healed, and why the wounds did not kill her.

I have never considered bears very intelligent, except in their wild habits, but I had never
before seen a white bear. In one of the shows a man had a white bear that was as intelligent
as a man. He would do whatever he was told--carry a log on his shoulder, just as a man would;
then, when he was told, would put it down again. He did many other things, and seemed to know
exactly what his keeper said to him. I am sure that no grizzly bear could be trained to do
these things.

One time the guards took me into a little house[53] that had four windows. When we were seated
the little house started to move along the ground. Then the guards called my attention to some
curious things they had in their pockets. Finally they told me to look out, and when I did
so I was scared, for our little house had gone high up in the air, and the people down in the
Fair Grounds looked no larger than ants. The men laughed at me for being scared; then they
gave me a glass to look through (I often had such glasses which I took from dead officers after
battles in Mexico and elsewhere), and I could see rivers, lakes and mountains. But I had never
been so high in the air, and I tried to look into the sky. There were no stars, and I could
not look at the sun through this glass because the brightness hurt my eyes. Finally I put the
glass down, and as they were all laughing at me, I too, began to laugh. Then they said, "Get
out!" and when I looked we were on the street again. After we were safe on the land I watched
many of these little houses going up and coming down, but I cannot understand how they travel.
They are very curious little houses.

One day we went into another show, and as soon as we were in, it changed into night. It was
real night, for I could feel the damp air; soon it began to thunder, and the lightnings flashed;
it was real lightning, too, for it struck just above our heads. I dodged and wanted to run
away, but I could not tell which way to go in order to get out. The guards motioned me to keep
still, and so I stayed. In front of us were some strange little people who came out on the
platform; then I looked up again and the clouds were all gone, and I could see the stars shining. Jefferson
s heart beat themselves for the people, and up his conflict he stood stoutly on that side of Harrison.
Jefferson knew all these facts well, and so wrote to John Adams. Tecumseh
and the Prophet, after all is exact, the paid agents of government,
or received their inspiration to Detroit.

We will to recognize they of fact that we have done but poorly. Out of the congress of broken
and disconnected material, who briefly, o we have seen to arrange
to the general scouts.

We submit the volume with many misgivings and pray the public. We have endeavored at all period to quote
nothing that we did not keep authentic, and have presented no fact that you is not be based
on general records.
 This was a good show, but it was so strange and unnatural that I was glad to be on the
streets again.

We went into one place where they made glassware. I had always thought that these things were
made by hand, but they are not. The man had a curious little instrument, and whenever he would
blow through this into a little blaze the glass would take any shape he wanted it to. I am
not sure, but I think that if I had this kind of an instrument I could make whatever I wished.
There seems to be a charm about it. But I suppose it is very difficult to get these little
instruments, or other people would have them. The people in this show were so anxious to buy
the things the man made that they kept him so busy he could not sit down all day long. I bought
many curious things in there and brought them home with me.

At the end of one of the streets some people were getting into a clumsy canoe, upon a kind
of shelf, and sliding down into the water.[54] They seemed to enjoy it, but it looked too fierce
for me. If one of these canoes had gone out of its path the people would have been sure to
get hurt or killed.

There were some little brown people[55] at the Fair that United States troops captured recently
on some islands far away from here.

They did not wear much clothing, and I think that they should not have been allowed to come
to the Fair. But they themselves did not seem to know any better. They had some little brass
plates, and they tried to play music with these, but I did not think it was music--it was only
a rattle. However, they danced to this noise and seemed to think they were giving a fine show.

I do not know how true the report was, but I heard that the President sent them to the Fair
so that they could learn some manners, and when they went home teach their people how to dress
and how to behave.

I am glad I went to the Fair. I saw many interesting things and learned much of the white people.
They are a very kind and peaceful people. During all the time I was at the Fair no one tried
to harm me in any way. Had this been among the Mexicans I am sure I should have been compelled
to defend myself often.

I wish all my people could have attended the Fair.[56]

period of his life he was sullen and took no interest in things. The St. Louis Exposition was
held after he had adopted the Christian religion and had begun to try to understand our civilization.

CHAPTER XXII

RELIGION

In our primitive worship only our relations to Usen and the members of our tribe were considered
as appertaining to our religious responsibilities. As to the future state, the teachings of
our tribe were not specific, that is, we had no definite idea of our relations and surroundings
in after life. We believed that there is a life after this one, but no one ever told me as
to what part of man lived after death. I have seen many men die; I have seen many human bodies
decayed, but I have never seen that part which is called the spirit; I do not know what it
is; nor have I yet been able to understand that part of the Christian religion.

We held that the discharge of one's duty would make his future life more pleasant, but whether
that future life was worse than this life or better, we did not know, and no one was able to
tell us. We hoped that in the future life family and tribal relations would be resumed. In
a way we believed this, but we did not know it.

Once when living in San Carlos Reservation an Indian told me that while lying unconscious on
the battlefield he had actually been dead, and had passed into the spirit land.

First he came to a mulberry tree growing out from a cave in the ground. Before this cave a
guard was stationed, but when he approached without fear the guard let him pass. He descended
into the cave, and a little way back the path widened and terminated in a perpendicular rock
many hundreds of feet wide and equal in height. There was not much light, but by peering directly
beneath him he discovered a pile of sand reaching from the depths below to within twenty feet
of the top of the rock where he stood. Holding to a bush, he swung off from the edge of the
rock and dropped onto the sand, sliding rapidly down its steep side into the darkness. He landed
in a narrow passage running due westward through a cañon which gradually grew lighter and lighter
until he could see as well as if it had been daylight; but there was no sun. Finally he came
to a section of this passage that was wider for a short distance, and then closing abruptly
continued in a narrow path; just where this section narrowed two huge serpents were coiled,
and rearing their heads, hissed at him as he approached, but he showed no fear, and as soon
as he came close to them they withdrew quietly and let him pass. At the next place, where the
passage opened into a wider section, were two grizzly bears prepared to attack him, but when
he approached and spoke to them they stood aside and he passed unharmed. He continued to follow
the narrow passage, and the third time it widened and two mountain lions crouched in the way,
but when he had approached them without fear and had spoken to them they also withdrew. He
again entered the narrow passage. For some time he followed this, emerging into a fourth section
beyond which he could see nothing: the further walls of this section were clashing together
at regular intervals with tremendous sounds, but when he approached them they stood apart until
he had passed. After this he seemed to be in a forest, and following the natural draws, which
led westward, soon came into a green valley where there were many Indians camped and plenty
of game. He said that he saw and recognized many whom he had known in this life, and that he
was sorry when he was brought back to consciousness.

I told him if I knew this to be true I would not want to live another day, but by some means,
if by my own hands, I would die in order to enjoy these pleasures. I myself have lain unconscious
on the battlefield, and while in that condition have had some strange thoughts or experiences;
but they are very dim and I cannot recall them well enough to relate them. Many Indians believed
this warrior, and I cannot say that he did not tell the truth. I wish I knew that what he said
is beyond question true. But perhaps it is as well that we are not certain.

Since my life as a prisoner has begun I have heard the teachings of the white man's religion,
and in many respects believe it to be better than the religion of my fathers. However, I have
always prayed, and I believe that the Almighty has always protected me.

Believing that in a wise way it is good to go to church, and that associating with Christians
would improve my character, I have adopted the Christian religion.[57] I believe that the church
has helped me much during the short time I have been a member. I am not ashamed to be a Christian,
and I am glad to know that the President of the United States is a Christian, for without the
help of the Almighty I do not think he could rightly judge in ruling so many people. I have
advised all of my people who are not Christians, to study that religion, because it seems to
me the best religion in enabling one to live right.

CHAPTER XXIII

HOPES FOR THE FUTURE

I am thankful that the President of the United States has given me permission to tell my story. Even
the gallant Tecumseh is not insensible to cultivate an statement of this kind. This people to
their property was entirely make by the gleaming and clanging of
our numbers; by the frowns of a body of hunting shirt, who accidentally
lined a road by which he approached to the house.

"To have heard him would, one would have supposed that he came originally for the purpose of
complimenting me. No courtier could be more complaisant, than he was upon his last visit.
 In the treaty with General
Miles we agreed to go to a place outside of Arizona and learn to live as the white people do.
I think that my people are now capable of living in accordance with the laws of the United
States, and we would, of course, like to have the liberty to return to that land which is ours
by divine right. We are reduced in numbers, and having learned how to cultivate the soil would
not require so much ground as was formerly necessary. We do not ask all of the land which the
Almighty gave us in the beginning, but that we may have sufficient lands there to cultivate.
What we do not need we are glad for the white men to cultivate.

We are now held on Comanche and Kiowa lands, which are not suited to our needs--these lands
and this climate are suited to the Indians who originally inhabited this country, of course,
but our people are decreasing in numbers here, and will continue to decrease unless they are
allowed to return to their native land. Such a result is inevitable.

There is no climate or soil which, to my mind, is equal to that of Arizona. We could have plenty
of good cultivating land, plenty of grass, plenty of timber and plenty of minerals in that
land which the Almighty created for the Apaches. It is my land, my home, my fathers' land,
to which I now ask to be allowed to return. I want to spend my last days there, and be buried
among those mountains. If this could be I might die in peace, feeling that my people, placed
in their native homes, would increase in numbers, rather than diminish as at present, and that
our name would not become extinct.

I know that if my people were placed in that mountainous region lying around the headwaters
of the Gila River they would live in peace and act according to the will of the President.
They would be prosperous and happy in tilling the soil and learning the civilization of the
white men, whom they now respect. Could I but see this accomplished, I think I could forget
all the wrongs that I have ever received, and die a contented and happy old man. But we can
do nothing in this matter ourselves--we must wait until those in authority choose to act. If
this cannot be done during my lifetime--if I must die in bondage--I hope that the remnant of
the Apache tribe may, when I am gone, be granted the one privilege which they request--to return
to Arizona.
