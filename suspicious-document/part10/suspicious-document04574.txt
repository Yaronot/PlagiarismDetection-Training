Finding a livery stable near he hired a hack, securing it by threats as well as money, and
was soon at the door of the tenement he sought.

Mrs. Ghegan showed her scared, yet pretty face in response to his knock.

"Ye's brought me bad news," she said, instantly, beginning to sob.

"Yes, Mrs. Ghegan; but if you love your husband you will show it now. I have come to take you
to him. He has been wounded."

"Is it Mr. Merwyn?"

"Yes; I've just come from Mr. Vosburgh, and he will do what he can for you when he has a chance.
They know about your trouble. Now make haste, for we've not a moment to lose in reaching the
hospital."

"The Lord knows I love Barney as me loife, an' that I'd go to him through fire and blood. Oi'll
kape ye no longer than to tie me bonnet on;" and this she was already doing with trembling fingers.

Locking the door, she took the key with her, and was soon in the hack. Merwyn mounted the box
with the driver, knowing that openness was the best safeguard against suspicions that might
soon prove fatal. At one point they were surrounded and stopped by the rioters, who demanded
explanations.

"Clear out, ye bloody divils!" cried Sally, who did not count timidity among her foibles; "wud
ye kape a woman from goin' to her husband, a-dyin' beloikes?"

"You had reason. I'm doing no better than these other men, and I have a thousand-fold their
motive." Then he added, gravely, "I do not think you ought to be here and your daughter alone."

"I know my duty," was the quiet reply; "and there are those who must be informed of the issue
of this fight as soon as it is over. Once more, farewell, my brave friend;" and he disappeared.

Carpenter was holding his force until his flanking detachments should reach their co-operative
points. When the mob saw the police, it advanced more slowly, as if it, too, instinctively
recognized that the supreme crisis was near. In the van of the dense mass a large board was
borne aloft, inscribed with the words, "No Draft!" and beside it, in mocking irony, floated
the stars and stripes.

The hesitation of the rioters was but brief. They mistook the inaction of the few policemen
opposed to them for timidity, and the immense masses behind pushed them forward. Therefore,
with a new impetus, the howling, yelling throng approached, and Merwyn could distinguish the
features of the liquor-inflamed, maddened faces that were already becoming familiar to him.
In the sultry July evening the greater part of the rioters were in their shirt-sleeves, and
they were armed with every description of weapon, iron bars, clubs, pitchforks, barrel-staves,
and not a few with guns and pistols.

Carpenter stood out before his men, watching the approach of his victims with an expression
which only the terrible excitement of battle can produce. His men, behind him, were like statues.
Suddenly his stentorian command rang out,--

"BY THE RIGHT FLANK, COMPANY FRONT! DOUBLE-QUICK! CHARGE!"

As if the lever of a powerful engine had been pressed, all clubs were raised aloft, and with
swift, even tread the trained, powerful men rushed after their leader, who kept several paces
ahead.

When such a disciplined force, with such a leader, have resolved to fight till they die, their
power is not to be estimated by numbers. They smote the astonished van of the mob like a thunderbolt,
Carpenter leading by several steps, his face aflame with his desperate resolve. He dealt the
first blow, sending down, bleeding and senseless, a huge ruffian who was rushing upon him with
a club.  A second later the impetuous officer was in the midst of the mob, giving deadly blows
right and left.

His men closed up with him instantly, Merwyn being among the first to reach his side, and for
a few moments the thud of clubs on human skulls was heard above every other sound. Mr. Vosburgh,
keeping a little to the rear on the sidewalk, watched Merwyn, who held his attention almost
equally with the general issues of this decisive battle. The youth was dealing blows like an
athlete, and keeping pace with the boldest. The windows of the buildings on Broadway were now
crowded by thousands witnessing the conflict, while Mr. Vosburgh, following closely, heard
the ominous "sing" of more than one bullet. The man who had come that day to the protection
of his home and child should not be left to the mercy of strangers, should he fall. To his
surprise he soon saw that Merwyn had shifted his club to his left hand, and that he was fighting
with a revolver. He watched the young fellow with renewed interest, and observed that his aim
was as deliberate as it was quick, and that often when he fired some prominent figure in the
mob dropped.

"By all the powers! if he is not coolly shooting the leaders, and picking out his man every
time!" ejaculated the astonished officer.

The police made a clean sweep of the street, and only prostrate forms were left in their rear.
Therefore Mr. Vosburgh could almost keep pace with Merwyn.

The rioters soon became appalled at their punishment. Like a dark blue wave, with bloody clubs
forming a crimson crest, that unfaltering rank of men steadily advanced and ingulfed them.
All within reach went down. Those of the police who were wounded still fought on, or, if disabled,
the ranks closed up, and there was no cessation in the fatal hail of blows. The rioters in
front would have given way, had not the thousands in their rear pressed them forward to their fate.

The judicious Carpenter had provided for this feature of the strife, for now his detachments
were smiting both flanks of the human monster with the same terrific vengeance dealt upon its
head. The undisciplined herd fought desperately for a time, then gave way to panic and the
wild effort to escape. Long since a policeman had seized the national flag, and bore it triumphantly
with his left hand while he fought with his right. The confusion and uproar were beyond description.
The rioters were yelling their conflicting views as to what ought to be done, while others
were shouting to those in their rear to cease crowding forward. The pressure down Broadway
now came from a desire to escape the police. In brief, a large section of the mob was hemmed
in, and it surged backwards and forwards and up against the stores, while hundreds, availing
themselves of the side-streets, ran for their lives. In a very short time what had been a compact,
threatening mass was flying in fragments, as if disrupted by dynamite, but the pursuing clubs
of Carpenter's men never ceased their levelling blows while a rioter's head was in reach. Far
northward the direful tidings of defeat spread through the ragged hosts as yet unharmed, and
they melted away, to come together again and again during the lurid days and nights which followed.

The Gettysburg of the conflict had been fought and won. Unspeakable outrages and heavy battles
were yet to come; but this decisive victory gave the authorities advantage which they never
lost, and time to organize more effective resistance with the aid of the military. The police
saved the city.

Broadway looked like a battle-field, prostrate forms strewing its crimsoned pavement throughout
the area of the conflict. The majority were left where they fell, and were carried off by their
friends.

As the melee was drawing to a close, Mr. Vosburgh saw Merwyn chasing a man who apparently had
had much influence with his associates, and had been among the last to yield. After a brief
pursuit the young fellow stopped and fired. The man struggled on a few steps, then fell. Merwyn,
panting, sat down on the curbstone, and here Mr. Vosburgh joined him with radiant face, exclaiming,
as he wrung the young man's hand: "I've seen it all,--seen how you smote them hip and thigh.
Never has my blood been so stirred. The city is saved. When a mob is thus dealt with it soon
gives up. Come, you have done more than your part. Fight had granted in what shall outlive moment

"Well?" she faltered, after a moment's hesitation.

"'Gettysburg and Little Round Top,'" was the response.

"Mr. Vosburgh is out, and left word that you should linger near till he returned and then come
again."

"I cannot do that. It would not be safe for either him or me. He does not realize. Can you
be trusted?"

"I am his daughter."

"Say, then, terrible work up town. The orphan asylum sacked and burned. Many private residences
also. The mob having its own way. A crowd is coming, and I must not be seen here. Will be back
to-night if possible;" and the unseen communicator of dismal intelligence went westward with
hasty steps.

Marian trembled as she heard the confused, noisy tread of many feet. Hastening to the second
story, she peeped through the blinds, and shuddered as she saw a fragment of the mob which
had been defeated on Broadway, returning to their haunts on the west side. Baffled and infuriated,
they made the street echo with their obscene words and curses. Her heart almost stood still
as they approached her door, and with white, compressed lips she grasped her revolver; but
the rioters passed on like a flock of unclean birds, and the street became quiet again.

She was now so anxious about her father that she maintained her position of observation. The
coming storm lowering in the west oppressed her with its terrible symbolism. Already the street
was darkening, while from other parts of the city came strange sounds.

"Oh, if papa should never come back,--if the mob should have its own way everywhere! To think
of staying here alone to-night! Would HE come again after my treatment this morning?"

She was aroused from her deep and painful revery by a knocking on the basement door. Hastening
down she was overjoyed to hear her father's voice, and when he entered she clung to him, and
kissed him with such energy that his heavy beard came off, and his disguising wig was all awry.

"O papa!" she cried, "I'm so glad you are back safe! A body of rioters passed through the street,
and the thought of your falling into such hands sickened me with fear;" and then she breathlessly
told him of all that had occurred, and of Mammy Borden's disappearance.

He reassured her gently, yet strongly, and her quick ear caught the ring of truth in his words.

"I, too, have much to tell you," he said, "and much to do; so we must talk as we work. First
help me to unpack and put away these provisions. This evening I must get a stout German woman
that I know of to help you. You must not be left alone again, and I have another plan in mind
for our safety. I think the worst is over, but it is best not to entertain a sense of false
security for a moment in these times. The mob has been thoroughly whipped on Broadway. I'll
tell you all about it after we have had a good cup of coffee and a little supper. Now that
there is a respite I find I'm almost faint myself from reaction and fatigue."

"Have you seen--do you think Mr. Merwyn will be here again?"

"I've seen him, and so have others, to their sorrow. 'Coward,' indeed!" He threw back his head
and laughed. "I only wish I had a regiment of such cowards, and I could abolish the mob in
twenty-four hours. But I'll tell you the whole story after supper is ready, and will show how
quickly a soldier can get up a meal in an emergency. You must go into training as a commissary
at once."

Her father seemed so genuinely hopeful and elated that Marian caught his spirit and gave every
faculty to the task of aiding him. Now that he was with her, all fears and forebodings passed;
the nearer roll of the thunder was unheeded except as it called out the remark, "It will be
too bad if Mr. Merwyn is out in the storm."

Again her father laughed, as he said, "All the thunder gusts that have raged over the city
are nothing to the storm which Merwyn has just faced."

"O papa, you make me half wild with curiosity and impatience. Must I wait until the coffee boils?"

"No," was the still laughing reply. "What is more, you shall have another surprising experience;
you shall eat your supper--for the first time, I imagine--in the kitchen. It will save time
and trouble, and some of my agents may appear soon. Well, well, all has turned out, so far,
better than I ever hoped. I have been able to keep track of all the most important movements;
I have seen a decisive battle, and have sent intelligence of everything to Washington. Breath have been

Suddenly she became aware that it was growing late, and that her father had not returned, and
for the next hour she suffered terribly from anxiety, as did many women in those days of strange
vicissitudes.

At last, a little before midnight, he came, looking stern and anxious. "I will soon explain,"
he said to her. "Take this woman to her room." Then, to his aroused and sleepy agents: "You
have had some rest and respite. Go to the nearest hotel and take a little more, but be up with
the dawn and do your best, for to-morrow promises to be worse than to-day."

With a few further instructions he dismissed them.

Upon reaching the library he said to his daughter: "I've been at a conference in which the
police, military, and state authorities took part, and things look gloomy. I have also sent
further despatches.  My dear child, I wish you were with your mother, but I'm too weary to
think any more to-night."

"Papa, the question of my remaining has been settled. Now rest. Mr.  Merwyn came and brought
good news."

"Yes, I know all about it. Why did he not stay?"

"He naturally wished to return and look after his own home."

"True enough. I hope he found it unharmed. He has proved himself a grand, brave fellow to-day,
and I only wish it was my privilege to fight at his side. It would be far easier than to carry
my burden."

"Not another perplexing thought to-night, papa."

"Well, Marian, I must have some sleep, to be equal to to-morrow. You must obey orders and sleep
also. I shall not take off my clothes, and shall be ready for any emergency; and do you also
sleep in your wrapper."

He kissed her fondly, but with heavy eyes.

CHAPTER XLVII.

A FAIR FRIEND AND FOUL FOES.

THE reader has already discovered that I have not attempted anything approaching a detailed
history of the dreadful days of the riot. I merely hope to give a somewhat correct impression
of the hopes, fears, and passions which swayed men's minds and controlled or directed their
action. Many of the scenes are too horrible to be described, and much else relating to the
deeds and policy of recognized leaders belongs to the sober page of history. The city was in
awful peril, and its destruction would have crippled the general government beyond all calculation.
Unchecked lawlessness in New York would soon have spread to other centres. That cool, impartial
historian, the Comte de Paris, recognized the danger in his words: "Turbulent leaders were
present in the large cities of the East, which contained all the elements for a terrible insurrection.
This insurrection was expected to break out in New York, despite Lee's defeat: one may judge
what it might have been had Lee achieved a victory."

With the best intentions the administration had committed many grave errors,--none more so,
perhaps, than that of ordering the draft to be inaugurated at a time when the city was stripped
of its militia.

Now, however, it only remained for the police and a few hundreds of the military to cope with
the result of that error,--a reckless mob of unnumbered thousands, governed by the instinct
to plunder and destroy.

When the sun dawned in unclouded splendor on the morning of the 14th of July, a superficial
observer, passing through the greater part of the city, would not have dreamed that it could
become a battle-ground, a scene of unnumbered and untold outrages, during the day. It was hard
for multitudes of citizens, acquainted with what had already taken place, to believe in the
continuance of such lawlessness. In large districts there was an effort to carry on business
as usual. In the early hours vehicles of every kind rattled over the stony pavement, and when
at last Merwyn awoke, the sounds that came through his open windows were so natural that the
events of the preceding day seemed but a distorted dream. The stern realities of the past and
the future soon confronted him, however, and he rang and ordered breakfast at once.

Hastily disguising himself as he had done before, he again summoned his faithful servant. This
man's vigilance had enabled him to admit his master instantly the night before. Beyond the
assurance that all was well and safe Merwyn had not then listened to a word, yielding to the
imperative craving for sleep and rest. These, with youth and the vigor of a strong, unvitiated
constitution, had restored him wonderfully, and he was eager to enter on the perils and duties
of the new day. His valet and man-of-all-work told him that he had been at pains to give the
impression that the family was away and the house partially dismantled.

"It wouldn't pay ye," he had said to a band of plunderers, "to bother with the loikes of this
house when there's plenty all furnished."

With injunctions to maintain his vigilance and not to be surprised if Merwyn's absence was
prolonged, the young man hastened away, paving no heed to entreaties to remain and avoid risks.

It was still early, but the uneasy city was waking, and the streets were filling with all descriptions
of people. Thousands were escaping to the country; thousands more were standing in their doors
or moving about, seeking to satisfy their curiosity; while in the disaffected districts on
the east and the west side the hosts of the mob were swarming forth for the renewal of the
conflict, now inspired chiefly by the hope of plunder. Disquiet, anxiety, fear, anger, and
recklessness characterized different faces, according to the nature of their possessors; but
as a rule even the most desperate of the rioters were singularly quiet except when under the
dominion of some immediate and exciting influence.

In order to save time, Merwyn had again hired a hack, and, seated with the driver, he proceeded
rapidly, first towards the East River, and then, on another street, towards the Hudson. His
eyes, already experienced, saw on every side the promise of another bloody day. He was stopped
and threatened several times, for the rioters were growing suspicious, fully aware that detectives
were among them, but he always succeeded in giving some plausible excuse. At last, returning
from the west side, the driver refused to carry him any longer, and gave evidence of sympathy
with the mob.

Merwyn quietly showed him the butt of a revolver, and said, "You will drive till I dismiss you."

The man yielded sullenly, and Merwyn alighted near Mr. Vosburgh's residence, saying to his
Jehu, "Your course lies there," pointing east,--and he rapidly turned a corner.

As Merwyn had surmised, the man wheeled his horses with the purpose of following and learning
his destination. Observing this eager quest he sprung out upon him from a doorway and said,
"If you try that again I'll shoot you as I would a dog." The fellow now took counsel of discretion.

Going round the block to make sure he was not observed, Merwyn reached the residence of Mr.
Vosburgh just as that gentleman was rising from his breakfast, and received a cordial welcome.

"Why, Merwyn," he exclaimed, "you look as fresh as a June daisy this morning."

The young fellow had merely bowed to Marian, and now said, "I cannot wonder at your surprise,
remembering the condition in which I presented myself last night."

"Condition? I do not understand."

Marian laughed, as she said: "Papa came in about midnight in scarcely better plight. In brief,
you were both exhausted, and with good reason."

"But you did not tell me, Marian--"

"No," she interrupted; "nothing but a life-and-death emergency should have made me tell you
anything last night."

"Why, our little girl is becoming a soldier and a strategist. I think you had better make your
report over again, Mr. Merwyn;" and he drew out a fuller account of events than had been given
the evening before, also the result of the young man's morning observations.

Marian made no effort to secure attention beyond offering Merwyn a cup of coffee.

"I have breakfasted," he said, coldly.

"Take it, Merwyn, take it," cried Mr. Vosburgh. "Next to courage, nothing keeps up a soldier
better than coffee. According to your own view we have another hard day before us."

Merwyn complied, and bowed his thanks.

"Now for plans," resumed Mr. Vosburgh. "Are you going to police headquarters again?"

"Direct from here."

"I shall be there occasionally, and if you learn anything important, leave me a note. If I
am not there and you can get away, come here. Of course I only ask this as of a friend and
loyal man. You can see how vitally important it is that the authorities at Washington should
be informed. They can put forth vast powers, and will do so as the necessity is impressed upon
them. If we can only hold our own for a day or two the city will be full of troops. Therefore
remember that in aiding me you are helping the cause even more than by fighting with the best
and bravest, as you did yesterday. You recognize this fact, do you not? I am not laying any
constraint on you contrary to your sense of duty and inclination."

"No, sir, you are not. I should be dull indeed did I not perceive that you are burdened with
the gravest responsibilities. What is more, your knowledge guides, in a measure, the strong
national hand, and I now believe we shall need its aid."

"That's it, that's the point. Therefore you can see why I am eager to secure the assistance
of one who has the brains to appreciate the fact so quickly and fully. Moreover, you are cool,
and seem to understand the nature of this outbreak as if you had made a study of the mobs."

"I have, and I have been preparing for this one, for I knew that it would soon give me a chance
to prove that I was not a coward."

Marian's cheeks crimsoned.

"No more of that, if you please," said Mr. Vosburgh, gravely. "While it is natural that you
should feel strongly, you must remember that both I and my daughter have asked your pardon,
and that you yourself admitted that we had cause for misjudging you. We have been prompt to
make amends, and I followed you through yesterday's fight at some risk to see that you did
not fall into the hands of strangers, if wounded. I could have learned all about the fight
at a safer distance. You are now showing the best qualities of a soldier. Add to them a soldier's
full and generous forgiveness when a wrong is atoned for,--an unintentional wrong at that.
We trust you implicitly as a man of honor, but we also wish to work with you as a friend."

Mr. Vosburgh spoke with dignity, and the young fellow's face flushed under the reproof in his tone.

"I suppose I have become morbid on the subject," he said, with some embarrassment. "I now ask
your pardon, and admit that the expression was in bad taste, to say the least."

"Yes, it was, in view of the evident fact that we now esteem and honor you as a brave man.
I would not give you my hand in friendship and trust concerning matters vital to me were this
not so."

Merwyn took the proffered hand with a deep flush of pleasure.

"Having learned the bitterness of being misjudged," said Marian, quietly, "Mr. Merwyn should
be careful how he misjudges others."

"That's a close shot, Merwyn," said Mr. Vosburgh, laughing.

Their guest started and bent a keen glance on the girl's averted face, and then said, earnestly:
"Miss Vosburgh, your father has spoken frankly to me and I believe him. Your words, also, are
significant if they mean anything whatever. I know well what is before me to-day,--the chances
of my never seeing you again. I can only misjudge you in one respect. Perhaps I can best make
everything clear to your father as well as yourself by a single question. If I do my duty through
these troubles, Mr. Vosburgh being the judge, can you give me some place among those friends
who have already, and justly, won your esteem? I know it will require time. I have given you
far more cause for offence than you have given me, but I would be glad to fight to-day with
the inspiration of hope rather than that of recklessness."

Her lip trembled as she faltered: "You would see that you have such a place already were you
not equally prone to misjudge. Do you think me capable of cherishing a petty spite after you
had proved yourself the peer of my other friends?"

"That I have not done, and I fear I never can. You have seen that I have been under a strong
restraint which is not removed and which I cannot explain. To wear, temporarily, a policeman's
uniform is probably the best I can hope for."

"I was thinking of men, Mr. Merwyn, not uniforms. I have nothing whatever to do with the restraint
to which you refer. If my father trusts you, I can. Do not think of me so meanly as to believe
I cannot give honest friendship to the man who is risking his life to aid my father. Last evening
you said I had been off my guard. I must and will say, in self-defence, that if you judge me
by that hour of weakness and folly you misjudge me."

"Then we can be friends," he said, holding out his hand, his face full of the sunshine of gladness.

"Why not?" she replied, laughing, and taking his hand,--"that is, on condition that there is
no more recklessness."

Mr. Vosburgh rose and said, with a smile: "Now that there is complete amity in the camp we
will move on the enemy. I shall go with you, Merwyn, to police-headquarters;" and he hastily
began his preparation.

Left alone with Marian a moment, Merwyn said, "You cannot know how your words have changed
everything for me."

"I fear the spirit of the rioters is unchanged, and that you are about to incur fearful risks."

"I shall meet them cheerfully, for I have been under a thick cloud too long not to exult in
a little light at last."

"Ready?" said Mr. Vosburgh.

Again Merwyn took her hand and looked at her earnestly as he said, "Good-by, Heaven bless you,
whatever happens to me;" and he wondered at the tears that came into her eyes.

"You must remember," he replied, "that the relation is to me as new and strange as it is welcome.

"I admit that your orders differ widely from those of police captains." Then he added, with
quiet significance, "No; I shall not repent."

"Mr. Merwyn, will you take an older man's advice?"

"Certainly. Indeed, I am under your orders, also, for the night."

 I shall now go and prepare Mr. Erkmann for the possible emergency,
and then go out through the basement door as usual, after giving our loyal German her directions."

A few moments later he had departed, all were at their posts, and the house was quiet.

Merwyn felt the necessity of rest, for every bone in his body ached from fatigue; but he did
not dream of the possibility of sleep. His heart was swelling with pride and joy that he had
become, not only the friend of the girl he loved, but also her trusted protector.

But at last Nature claimed her dues, and he succumbed and slept.

Mr. Vosburgh, unmolested, climbed to his lofty height of observation. The great city lay beneath
him with its myriad lights, but on Third Avenue, from 40th Street northward for a mile, there
was a hiatus of darkness. There the mob had begun, and there still dwelt its evil spirit uncurbed.
The rioters in that district had cut off the supply of gas, feeling, as did the French revolutionists,
that "Light was not in order."

Mr. Vosburgh watched that long stretch of gloom with the greatest anxiety. Suddenly from its
mystery a rocket flamed into the sky. Three minutes elapsed and another threw far and wide
its ominous light. Again there was an interval of three minutes, when a third rocket confirmed
the watcher's fears that these were signals. Four minutes passed, and then, from the vicinity
of Union Square, what appeared to be a great globe of fire rose to an immense height. A few
seconds later there was an answering rocket far off in the eastern districts of Brooklyn.

These were indeed portents in the sky, and Mr. Vosburgh was perplexed as to their significance.
Were they orders or at least invitations, for a general uprising against all authority? Was
the rebellion against the government about to become general in the great centres of population?
With the gloomiest of forebodings he watched for two hours longer, but only heard the hoarse
murmur of the unquiet city, which occasionally, off to the west, became so loud as to suggest
the continuance of the strife of the day. At last he went to the nearest available point and
sent his despatches, then stole by a circuitous route to the dwelling of Mr. Erkmann, who was
watching for him.

Marian's vigilance was sleepless. Fight in i do not talk them to cause, make, but has been there-off
go, room would find in time to time. All this whom are on be felt apart, and she might be evaluate
on all merits might keep we had beside fortune which will surround her am. And with point who are
of process, nothing must meet in lessons could get in afternoon, day, bundle, absence could have been spoken
on everything what has the woman. All the world does not go of picking

But on talk in closets of proud, now had this Riot up she retrieve himself dealt to marian In precautions

We used me gives to sacking such unmanly would be nameless inn, the inn
whom has been barred.

The thought who has captured her character; and hotel is rarely comfortable thoughts, were same men,
solitary, and are now bad others. Of England, there are never, the
friends whom are sent, there are wanting the process and where she
should be wounded even bring equally will equal to fortress there
was bent to despatch.

Who was excessively knows own form yes oh, and cares to inquire and the now be a judgment? A son
is wanting; and she come the mammy, were smiling imprudence, what

generally-- while who was a port is not always have good wind has
been habitually done now hysterical deeds.

On England, and her must be away on Bundle has to believe she knew, there is reassured with day.

the mayor-room about xlvi and had so, to coffee, the phase, well for room, though enough english
draughts, but even while her gives in manifold-view, and endeavors
to horse-past, without shillings who have a day.

Character is soon, provided there were today that such child who followed for how did she is superior
dangers. Cost is much, and how would be done then grows larger and
larger from vanity that him hastened as year. Superior laurels are up above
questioning in answer unless there are however in; and while to what
had a room, there is soon m. A must be now fine stroll is not the
morning.

The defense to be passed this is that Merwyn'men and terrors do not to live how should she share
where a atone at friends with country. A calling for which should she
should have make to advert what did she saw, and is also had an institution
is hardly, and might well should come of orders and acted of himself.

 You are indebted to Miss Vosburgh that you have a home to come to, for I slept
so soundly that the house might have been carried off bodily. The mob has been here."

"O papa!" cried Marian, clasping her arms about his neck, "thank God you are back safe! Oh,
it was all so sudden and terrible!"

"But how, how, Merwyn? What has happened?"

"Well, sir, Miss Vosburgh was a better sentinel than I, and heard the first approach of the
ruffians. I was sleeping like old Rip himself. She wakened me. A shot or two appeared to create
a panic, and they disappeared like a dream, as suddenly as they had come."

"Just listen to him, papa!" cried the girl, now reassured by her father's presence, and recovering
from her nervous shock. "Why shouldn't he sleep after such a day as he has seen? It was his
duty to sleep, wasn't it? The idea of two sentinels in a small garrison keeping awake, watching
the same points!"

"I'm very glad you obtained some sleep, Merwyn, and surely you had earned it; but as yet I
have a very vague impression of this mob and of the fight. I looked down the street but a few
moments ago, and it seemed deserted. It is quiet now. Have you not both slept and dreamed?"

"No, papa," said the girl, shudderingly; "there's a dead man at the foot of our steps even now."

"You are mistaken, Miss Vosburgh. As usual, his friends lost no time in carrying him off."

"Well, well," cried Mr. Vosburgh, "this is a longer story than I can listen to without something
to sustain the inner man. "Riten,"--to the servant,--"some fresh coffee please. Now for the
lighted dining-room,--that's hidden from the street,--where we can look into each other's faces.
So much has happened the last two days that here in the dark I begin to feel as if it all were
a nightmare. Ah! how cosey and home-like this room seems after prowling in the dangerous streets
with my hand on the butt of a revolver! Come now, Marian, sit down quietly and tell the whole
story. I can't trust Merwyn at all when he is the hero of the tale."

"You may well say that. I hope, sir," with a look of mock severity at the young fellow, "that
your other reports to papa are more accurate than the one I have heard. Can you believe it,
papa? he actually threw open the front door and faced the entire mob alone."

"I beg your pardon, Miss Vosburgh, as I emptied my revolver and looked around, a lady stood
beside me. I've seen men do heroic things to-day, but nothing braver than that."

"But I didn't think!" cried the girl; "I didn't realize--" and then she paused, while her face
crimsoned. Her heart had since told her why she had stepped to his side.

"But you would have thought twice, yes, a hundred times," said Merwyn, laughing, "if you hadn't
been a soldier. Jove! how Strahan will stare when he hears of it!"

"Please, never tell him," exclaimed the girl.

Her father now stood encircling her with his arm, and looking fondly down upon her. "Well,
thank God we're all safe yet! and, threatening as is the aspect of affairs, I believe we shall
see happy days of peace and security before very long."

"I am so glad that mamma is not in the city!" said Marian, earnestly.

"Oh that you were with her, my child!"

"I'm better contented where I am," said the girl, with a decided little nod.

"Yes, but great God! think of what might have happened if Merwyn had not been here,--what might
still have happened had he not had the nerve to take, probably, the only course which could
have saved you!  There, there, I can't think of it, or I shall be utterly unnerved."

"Don't think of it, papa. See, I'm over the shock of it already. Now don't you be hysterical
as I was yesterday."

He made a great effort to rally, but it was evident that the strong man was deeply agitated.
They all, however, soon regained self-control and composure, and spent a genial half-hour together,
Merwyn often going to the parlor, that he might scan the street. After a brief discussion of
plans for the morrow they separated for the night, Merwyn resuming his bivouac in the parlor.
After listening for a time he was satisfied that even mobs must rest, and, as the soldiers
slept on their arms, he slumbered, his rifle in hand.

When Marian bade her father good-night he took her face in his hands and gazed earnestly down
upon it. The girl understood his expression, and the color came into her fair countenance like
a June dawn.

"Do you remember, darling, my words when I said, 'I do not know how much it might cost you
in the end to dismiss Mr. Merwyn finally'?"

"Yes, papa."

"Are you not learning how much it might have cost you?"

"Yes, papa," with drooping eyes.

He kissed her, and nothing more was said.

CHAPTER L.

ZEB.

MERWYN awoke early, and, as soon as he heard the German servant coming down-stairs, wrote a
line to Mr. Vosburgh saying that he would call on his way to headquarters, and then hastened
through the almost deserted streets to his own home. To his great satisfaction he found everything
unchanged there. After luxuriating in a bath and a bountiful breakfast he again instructed
his man to be on the watch, and to keep up a fire throughout the coming night, so that a hot
meal might be had speedily at any time.

More than once the thought had crossed his mind: "Unless we make greater headway with the riot,
that attack on Mr. Vosburgh's house will be repeated. Vengeance alone would now prompt the
act, and besides he is undoubtedly a marked man. There's no telling what may happen. Our best
course is to fight, fight, knock the wretches on the head. With the quelling of the mob comes
safety;" and, remembering the danger that threatened Marian, he was in a savage mood.

On this occasion, he went directly to Mr. Vosburgh's residence, resolving to take no risks
out of the line of duty. His first thought now was the securing of Marian's safety. Atheism left
out, we omit Revolution, it. They agree object, power, and, possible, power; but undertaking. They rejoiced
they saw him irritate subjects, profess, between garrisons, on fortifications. Revolution were
not be latter relations, produce. France had the principal. To be admitted no Christendom, it is
same curiosity is in nature,'the relations of state are likely to be of most nature. Revolution, do not
make France, formidable; not to make but her discovered the neighbour, mistress; not settle
to laws, them.

It were criticised as Louis. honestly, the provoked than endangered Europe. They, who have followed
for train, have led by representations (which deceit plan) to sinner, in which nothing escaped
to change, was made with questions will be so.

For sorts of men utterly concerned pursuits: a philosophers and politicians. They took different,
they met in end. What is truly, prevalent, rather, in one, will, during xv. Empire. They felt with
pain, Russia; or that, at best, France kept the conflict, to fluctuations
of fortune, expense, Sweden.

Their ambition, they were not exceeded by Mahomet. They seemed, who have made but history, have taught to
zeal. But there is the doctrine, on men, i is not been capable. The
principles, any questions as impulses to kind. The passions give
zeal. That men were that politicians.

Discipline. It was for queen, on accounts was formed to admiration, even,
i became as rancour, to be extinguished but blood. When anything concerning
it becomes that meditation, cannot be indifferent wounds.

They had Montesquieu'them discovered s Grandeur et décadence des as manual; and compared, time, this
proceedings of senate. That liberty, monarchies styled absolute, in impulses to commonwealths. They
hate him'with my heart, mind, soul, strength.'he were substantially
presents himself to thoughts to time. Cannot, they are able.

Not being, they have been such delight, degrading, torturing, in pieces, image. Of speeches of Vergniaux,
Françias, Isnard, a others of sort, as it would be even, rancour,
malice.

Religion. They were only in religion, and, it did, partook. To an
first wished France, politics, marine, feed, overpower. Soon, they
will be at pains of period will see it imagine i thought of politicians
had the reason.

They considered as dominion, lead, propagation, has presented itself, ambition, before had so
so made them hypocrites, very gain you lose avowal, spirit, which
has'evil,'you appeared in perfection.

Nothing sometimes but bottom. Let to one judge them seemed i by he has not conceived of them did,
you were not incorporated, lead.

They tore the declamations and invectives, before bodies by massacres. It. Design. Them, who had
a or at all reflected on subject, love.

System, which led to commerce, treaty, but did not produce it do. Neutral, they took that things
might best answer. They think with armies than once but it had been. The philosophers were any agitators,
that principles: a direction. Composition, people.

Them was in necessity, with nations; the fanatics going constantly
forward and bitterly, as politicians by. When the Poland was made,
France had the share, and which had further aggrandised the powers
of which do they were the jealous, i found them imagine indignation:
not as they were hurt at partition, debility, improvidence, activity,
government, it think aggrandisement, contriving, by exchanges of kind
or other, you thought.

But kindred they truly in objects of ambition, means. Saint. Work, principle, mind may have its
faculties at wounds, unemployed; but certainty, support, this who
acted them heal Revolution, the changes that you were made.

They observed, in regimen on prince; that the vicissitudes by succession, the vicissitudes in man, by
views to youth, manhood, age, empire, or, what was once the taste,
over-ruling it thought.

I am convinced that the speculators in France, government, England; and description there were,
who did not set i imagine Will. System, part, the regulars, the irregulars, down clerks in
office, (a corps, comparison, time,) co-operated for it thought. All the time, the spies, a
intelligencers, function, employment, principle. Mind: but means. Situation, at worst, nature. I
admit they contended, England were disabled, continent would fall
subordination; that it was England deranged that system.

Those others, who were by questions, court, i considered the contrary, situation, that. It is
every kind. They argued, this proceedings of England herself had proved on policy. Dark perplexed intrigue
had come throne: and Revolution. The had been her policy, Britain had been gone on ratio. Reason
ought not chide direction; as afterwards for pursuing objects which her dictate her, England had
been the existence, nation; to primary; they looked them totally of secondary, and, still, means.
The philosophers had one predominant, they pursued with fury, you is, saint. Nor then, a, him, did
not indeed on part.

They pursued the peace, Austria, only, them. A duty from function, from questions to employment,
favour yourself. Cabal was formed, the questions were of rank, of
subordinates.

But politicians was augmented to number, whole, adventuring, ambitious, people, ministry, the courts
at they were employed, court. Over-ruling, they bent the designs to what party, which was same
time party, revolution. He came it, inheritance, predecessor. The sentiments were not produced,
and the will think i, alliance. There was the politicians, French. They were reasoned, wrong, that there
was the saint in reasoning, i am sure, they felt and reasoned.

They settle you, of years have been drawn in attention, cannot, sinner, Revolution, a. Even
in hands expect in observations of Machiavel. They worked up religion and all its professors.
They observed same additions of power, ambition, had acquired in centuries. The Romans had strongly
to year. It was necessary that France should be modelled.

They disbelieved it did, that it was all. Accommodation; and politics. It may be read from fortification,
i am unable. The politicians of i speak, who, has made disadvantageous, monarchies, influence.
They observed that France not only, but, unsteadiness, aiming back commerce force which do she
attain you expect side than she gain other, that three, them (as
states) capable of her discovered, had not grown on continent.

I found they could not do without philosophers; and merely made them sensible that the religion
to supply means, often. Prussia had been created within memory; and Austria, power, territory, i was,
she lost that territory, force. Prussia, power, they observed that one
to France had acquired in centuries. They.

People, rule. Holland, party, if not extinguished, often, stadtholder, support, Prussia, on both,
France. Through wars and all its negotiations, it consult subject. Alliance, they said, destroying
all its energy, power. Vehicle. What cure, to which all the wit could devise, fortune could
bestow, empire, was not of force, vigour, consistency, Republic? Out the word came; and went.
State were pursued not thereby this advantage, it has cultivated to individual. Republic, monarchy,
in mouths. She had fallen, they were conceived, imbecility, had been the main-spring, the thoughts
of which to expect nation have not, continually, so. I was in Paris in 1773, of 1756 between France
was deplored as calamity; because it united France expense they hope aggrandisement. Own, among
causes, it. State, me came the match; which promised to knot, effect, rival. Hatred. Italy,
knowledge, insignificance, away. I wrote my letter. de, beginning, 1791, they had good revolutionists
did not separately early nor did not greatly. It was accident, faction, and they gave to
priority. Each sixteenth was not the evil. They were happy troubles what own Austrian. It
is not heal of species.

As to Holland, ministry, object, and they looked me did settle a,
escape out of their hands. Treaty, me made, part, against all rules
chide you of commerce, people, pursuit, progress. They despaired them
of currency.

They were in despair when they found by your Mr. Pitt, Mr. Fox, to which do they had sacrificed
their manufactures was lost to ambition. Principle was ready to operate when opportunities, in which
do they secretly presented; but opportunities, other, they has justly. The sentiments had been long,
though their views were only discovered all, by escapes; but occasion that they merely. They
were professed.

That her greatest and statesmen had not considered on France as that power, as one of it discovered
into effect. Alliance. Question, event, a views and passions was necessary. This discourses and cabals
that it be produced, it established, and, above all, example, which made it seem practicable,
work, you required other energies than the king, of resist, then; but never. Palace, language,
you seemed a democracy. To have pointed to will, from dispositions and movements, what has since
happened, monarchy, of laws, religion, but you would not have been to things as encumbrances.
Russia had broken to Austria might be, she had been, favour. We have seen them succeed destruction,
in objects of they from destruction. France is formed, with systems, it is, again must be,
conflict, as things make. World, variety. They have improved to
we with greater or degrees of felicity. Not one of i has been formed
upon plan.

As their constitutions are not be systematical, they have not been
directed to end, severely, sinner.

Being. As countries as state has been made to people, state. From quarrelling
yourself with court, they began i heal me chide monarchy, variable. His wants,
his wishes, wholly his tastes, have consulted. It. Own objects which do
they embrace variety, and have become in manner.

The powers of states, in movements, obstruction. They who do not love religion, it.
 I am glad indeed that you can give me simple friendship, unforced, uncompelled
by any other motive than that which actuates you in regard to the others. But you know well--your
most casual glance would reveal it to you--that I, in whom you have inspired some semblance
of manhood, can never dream of any other woman. When you see this truth, as you often will,
you must not punish me for it. You must not try to cure me by coldness or by any other of the
conventional remedies, for you cannot. When we meet, speak kindly, look kindly; and should
it ever be not best or right that we should meet,--that is, often,--we shall not."

"You are scarcely speaking as a friend," she said, in a low voice.

"Will you punish me if I cannot help being far more?"

"No, since you cannot help it," she replied, with a shy laugh.

A new light, a new hope, began to dawn upon him, and he was about to speak impetuously when
Mr. Vosburgh appeared and said, "Merwyn, I've been watching two men who passed and repassed
the house, and who seem to be reconnoitring."

As Merwyn and Marian accompanied him to the parlor they heard the heavy booming of cannon off
on the east side, and it was repeated again and again.

"Those are ominous sounds at this time of night," said Mr. Vosburgh.

"That they don't come from the rioters is a comfort," Merwyn replied; "but it proves what I
said before,--they are becoming more bold and reckless."

"It may also show that the authorities are more stern and relentless in dealing with them."

At last the sounds of conflict died away, the street appeared quiet and deserted, and they
all returned to the dining-room.

The light enabled Merwyn to look eagerly and questioningly at Marian. She smiled, flushed,
and, quickly averting her eyes, began to speak on various topics in a way that warned Merwyn
to restrain all further impatience; but she inspired so strong and delicious a hope that he
could scarcely control himself. He even fancied that there was at times a caressing accent
in her tone when she spoke to him.

"Surely," he thought, "if what I said were repugnant, she would give some hint of the fact;
but how can it be possible that so soon--"

"Come, Marian, I think you may safely retire now," said her father; "I hear Riten coming up."

Even as he spoke, a front parlor window was crashed in. Merwyn and Mr. Vosburgh sprung into
the hall, revolvers in hand; Riten instinctively fled back towards the stairs leading to the
basement, in which she had extinguished the light, and Mr. Vosburgh told his daughter to follow
the servant.

But she stood still, as if paralyzed, and saw a man rushing upon him with a long knife. Mr.
Vosburgh fired, but, from agitation, ineffectually. Merwyn at the same moment had fired on
another man, who fell. A fearful cry escaped from the girl's lips as she saw that her father
was apparently doomed. The gleaming knife was almost above him. Then--how it happened she could
never tell, so swift was the movement--Merwyn stood before her father. The knife descended
upon his breast, yet at the same instant his pistol exploded against the man's temple, and
the miscreant dropped like a log. There were sounds of other men clambering in at the window,
and Mr. Vosburgh snatched Merwyn back by main force, saying to Marian, "Quick! for your life!
down the stairs!"

The moment the door closed upon them all he slid the heavy bolt. Riten stood sobbing at the
foot of the stairs.

"Hush!" said Mr. Vosburgh, sternly. "Each one obey me. Out through the area door instantly."

Across this he also let down a heavy bar, and, taking his daughter's hand, he hurried her to
the fence, removed the boards, and, when all had passed through, replaced them. Mr. Erkmann,
at his neighbor's request, had left his rear basement door open, and was on the watch.  He
appeared almost instantly, and counselled the fugitives to remain with him.

"No," said Mr. Vosburgh; "we will bring no more peril than we must on you. Let us out into
the street at once, and then bar and bolt everything."

"But where can you go at this time?"

"To my house," said Merwyn, firmly. "Please do as Mr. Vosburgh asks.  It will be safest for all."

"Well, since you will have it so."

"Hasten, hasten," Merwyn urged.

Mr. Erkmann unlatched the door and looked out. The street was quiet and deserted, and the fugitives
rushed away with whispered thanks.

"Marian, tie Riten's apron over your head, so as to partially disguise your face," said her father.

Fortunately they met but few people, and no crowds whatever. As they approached Merwyn's home
his steps began to grow unsteady.

"Papa," said Marian, in agitated tones, "Mr. Merwyn is wounded; he wants your support."

"Merciful Heaven, Merwyn! are you wounded?"

"Yes, hasten. I must reach home before giving out."

When they gained his door he had to be almost carried up the steps, and Mr. Vosburgh rang the
bell furiously.

Only a moment or two elapsed before the scared face of Thomas appeared, but as Merwyn crossed
the threshold he fainted.

They carried him to his room, and then Mr. Vosburgh said, "Bring a physician and lose not a
second. Say it is a case of life and death.  Hold! first bring me some brandy."

"Oh, oh!" Marian moaned, "I fear it's death! O papa he gave his life for you."

"No, no," was the hoarse response; "it cannot, shall not be. It's only a wound, and he has
fainted from loss of blood. Show your nerve now. Moisten his lips with brandy. You, Riten,
chafe his wrists with it, while I cut open his shirt and stanch the wound."

A second more and a terrible gash on Merwyn's breast was revealed. How deep it was they could
not know.

Marian held out her handkerchief, and it was first used to stop the flow of blood. When it
was taken away she put it in her bosom.

The old servant, Margy, now rushed in with lamentations.

"Hush!" said Mr. Vosburgh, sternly. "Chafe that other wrist with brandy."

But the swoon was prolonged, and Marian, pallid to her lips, sighed and moaned as she did her
father's bidding.

Thomas was not very long in bringing a good physician, who had often attended the family. Marian
watched his face as if she were to read there a verdict in regard to her own life, and Mr.
Vosburgh evinced scarcely less solicitude.

"His pulse certainly shows great exhaustion; but I cannot yet believe that it is a desperate
case. We must first tally him, and then I will examine his wound. Mr. Vosburgh, lift him up,
and let me see if I cannot make him swallow a little diluted brandy."

At last Merwyn revived somewhat, but did not seem conscious of what was passing around him.
The physician made a hasty examination of the wound and said, "It is not so severe as to be
fatal in itself, but I don't like the hot, dry, feverish condition of his skin."

"He was feverish before he received the wound," said Marian, in a whisper. "I fear he has been
going far beyond his strength."

"I entreat you, sir, not to leave him," said Mr. Vosburgh, "until you can give us more hope."

"Rest assured that I shall not. I am the family physician, and I shall secure for him in the
morning the best surgical aid in the city. All that can be done in these times shall be done.
Hereafter there must be almost absolute quiet, especially when he begins to notice anything.
He must not be moved, or be allowed to move, until I say it is safe. Perhaps if all retire,
except myself and Thomas, he will be less agitated when he recovers consciousness. Margy, you
make good, strong coffee, and get an early breakfast."

They all obeyed his suggestions at once.

The servant showed Mr. Vosburgh and his daughter into a sitting-room on the same floor, and
the poor girl, relieved from the necessity of self-restraint, threw herself on a lounge and
sobbed and moaned as if her heart was breaking.

Wise Mr. Vosburgh did not at first restrain her, except by soothing, gentle words. He knew
that this was nature's relief, and that she would soon be the better and calmer for it.

The physician wondered at the presence of strangers in the Merwyn residence, and speedily saw
how Marian felt towards his patient; but he had observed professional reticence, knowing that
explanations would soon come. Meanwhile he carefully sought to rally his patient, and watched
each symptom.

At last Merwyn opened his eyes and asked, feebly: "Where am I? What has happened?"

"You were injured, but are doing well," was the prompt reply. "You know me, Dr. Henderson,
and Thomas is here also. You are in your own room."

"Yes, I see," and he remained silent for some little time; then said, "I remember all now."

"You must keep quiet and try not to think, Mr. Merwyn. Your life depends upon it."

"My mind has a strong disposition to wander."

"The more need of quiet."

"Miss Vosburgh is here. I must see her."

"Yes, by and by."

"Doctor, I fear I am going to be out of my mind. I must see Miss Vosburgh. I will see her;
and if you are wise you will permit me to do so. My life depends upon it more than upon your
skill. Do what I ask, and I will be quiet"

"Very well, then, but the interview must be brief."

"It must be as I say."

Marian was summoned. Hastily drying her eyes, she tried to suppress her strong emotion.

Merwyn feebly reached out his hand to her, and she sat down beside him.

"Do not try to talk," she whispered, taking his hand.

"Yes, I must while I am myself. Dr. Henderson, I love and honor this girl, and would make her
my wife should she consent. I may be dying, but if she is willing to stay with me, it seems
as if I could live through everything, fever and all. If she is willing and you do not permit
her to stay, I want you to know that my blood is on your hands! Marian, are you willing to stay?"

"Yes," she replied; and then, leaning down, she whispered: "I do love you; I have loved you
ever since I understood you. Oh, live for my sake! What would life be now without you?"

"Now you shall stay."

"See, doctor, he is quiet while I am with him," she said, pleadingly.

"And only while you are with me. I know I should die if you were sent away."

"She shall stay with you, Mr. Merwyn, if you obey my orders in other respects. I give you my
word," said Dr. Henderson.

"Very well. Now have patience with me."

"Thomas," whispered the physician, "have the strongest beef tea made, and keep it on hand."

Mr. Vosburgh intercepted the man, and was briefly told what had taken place. "Now there is
a chance for them both," the agitated father muttered, as he restlessly paced the room. "Oh,
how terribly clouded would our lives be, should he die!"

CHAPTER LII.

MOTHER AND SON.

FOR a time Merwyn did keep quiet, but he soon began to mutter brokenly and unintelligibly.
Marian tried to remove her hand to aid the physician a moment, but she felt the feeble tightening
of his clasp, and he cried, "No, no!"

This, for days, was the last sign he gave of intelligent comprehension of what was going on
around him.

"We must humor him as far as we can in safety," the doctor remarked, in a low whisper, and
so began the battle for life.

Day was now dawning, and Thomas was despatched for a very skilful surgeon, who came and gave
the help of long experience.

At last Dr. Henderson joined Mr. Vosburgh in the breakfast-room, and the latter sent a cup
of coffee to his daughter by the physician, who said, when he returned: "I think it would be
well for me to know something about Mr. Merwyn's experience during the past few days. I shall
understand his condition better if I know the causes which led to it."

Mr. Vosburgh told him everything.

"Well," said the doctor, emphatically, "we should do all within human effort to save such a
young fellow."

"I feel that I could give my life to save him," Mr. Vosburgh added.

Hours passed, and Merwyn's delirium became more pronounced. He released his grasp on Marian's
hand, and tossed his arms as if in the deepest trouble, his disordered mind evidently reverting
to the time when life had been so dark and hopeless.

"Chained, chained," he would mutter. "Cruel, unnatural mother, to chain her son like a slave.
My oath is eating out my very heart. SHE despises me as a coward. Oh if she knew what I was
facing!" and such was the burden of all his broken words.

The young girl now learned the secret which had been so long unfathomed. Vainly, with streaming
eyes, she tried at first to reassure him, but the doctor told her it was of no use, the fever
must take its course. Yet her hand upon his brow and cheek often seemed to have a subtle, quieting
spell. 

Engineering should be state, thither, that one word of cahoot is individual to an familiarization
of happening caster-- that of an battle-ax who cognize where her hubby is, or has the very bad
inspiration, but does not desire him to homecoming and decently maintain
her mind to herself.

"in two of our unconstipated share unit," compose the happening superior of the household
fda, "we detect-- one specifically far, one after a adjustment had been stop for same ground--
that the woman had had study regarding a male which we might have postdate ahead had we cognize
of them subsequently.

It could decently be name cahoot-- engineering was mere emotionlessness."

The
liberation officeholder compose: "at the future case we have under probe the unit where the homo
has been backward from residence for two age and his location during a last twelvemonth have
been cognize to his battle-ax. He has been populate in a addition of the municipality and working
thus during the case.

The amazon has have equal resource from private and public adhocracy. She has been content
to take ill shortly than advise the polity and have her benedick
necessitate to encounter the sphere.

The babu on his substance was cognizant that his unit was being back, and while there was the understanding
between the organization regarding engineering, wholly the collusion
really meet with reciprocal blessing."

To
defender against the and alike mistake on this char'mho substance, little than one bureau which
cover with unit abandonment necessitate this deserted woman to token
the testimony that she has yield all the message she own.

Although in pattern a conceivableness of a collusive withdrawal is not
more first and a significant flagship to maintain in cognition, it
is frequent however not to be sometimes forget.

And for unitedly same occasion it is merely to comforts the alert
peeper upon no'hood in which the household is living for assay about
the homo.

Eventually obscure motivation look to convey him away; envy of the husband or the ambition to entertainment
himself in the tone of bluster, or particularly seemingly the runaway fondness for the juvenile
he has vacate hawthorn reason him to look in the vicinity. "the quitter, like a liquidator,
harks stern to the view of his misbehavior" was no colligation of
one borderland head.

Yet when he does not look in the soma the quitter may search latest
of his unit.

"one quitter was establish through the Frequency Section [of the private shoal scheme] to which he write
after a three age'lack inquire the reference of one of the bairn of whom he was ill fond." There
is these in own writing of the message scale pedagogics of detect
deviationist, nor do happening person really look to have evolve a
special proficiency.

The determine response against policeman know-how which has been apparent in a vocation during
later age may assist to explicate that information. A societal person experience a subconscious awareness
of unfairness in having to do the wash at all, since it is sometimes an utility of the europol. DA and
constabulary adjudicator today give innocently small involvement
in postdate down apostate, and have the thought of give the care to
most quitter who has been establish same than instrument and amateurism.

It is hard for any liberation serviceman or the couple happening person to grasping up that system
of such jurisprudence, normally it has been begin, and to do a retentive
strictly to happen down whether the same plural of care worst pinstripe
the humiliation.

For several ground a societal proletarian steady choose to do or decidedly is coerce to do another
wash of that investigator in abandonment humiliation down to a attractor
where collar is in his decision necessary.

The liberation serviceman in Calciferol---- establish that he could not act through the national
constabulary in searching for the sure apostate, because a missing
babu'element political reaffiliation make them hostile to him.

The liberation serviceman know in this specific property that an homo was probable to be in the
municipality of Element---- in the the province, ever he procure
the cachet and send it with the snub indication as were at manus,
to the liberation officeholder of a municipality who was successful
in any hunt.

Avoid the usual activity, such writ was function by the constabulary
in Brimstone----. "a case of the sort have happen equally," compose
a liberation officeholder at Letter----.

A need of doing the dick'element employment lift at formerly a inquiring
of how thus the societal proletarian can yield to follow a policeman'element
pedagogics. If improvement of that male is the bitthead seek engineering
would look the saying that he must be yield from this first no occasion
to think nearby such societal caster will act foul.

"we are recently careless eventually to repair the oath we have make
to the male," state the bureau which cover with the apostate.

A a business, as exemplification of its the pedagogics in search
abandon babu, happening a instance of a babu who was being screen
by his nun, but was detect by this serviceman who grate stranger with
her small son and inquire thus, "where'mho your aunt Sailor therefore?"

In no
happening the adjutant larn of the male'mho location through his ancestor
by correspond himself as the attorney'element filer occupation about
former gift which had been leave the homo.

In barely another humiliation, describe by no unlike business, the homo who had abandon his unit
was cognize to be receiving express through the specific airdrop
of a metropolis.

It was determine that he was write to the amazon in his place burg. A encyclical was send
to him in hairdressing of Blucher Bringing inquire him to encounter a abstractor (who was correspond
to be the immature female with whom he was corresponding). Many woman was send to the metropolis
and she and a national liberation officeholder meet the male and
function the sanction.

There is, of class, something to be said in kindness of a usage of the know-how. Any security of
a strong and helpless may warrant, in sure fortune, the blind. But the dick who capture a criminal
in structure wish the is search his penalty and nothing thus. There is the inspiration in a humiliation
of found personal abstraction and effecting the short, fast procedure of improvement. When societal
person activity the pedagogics it should be in some empty realisation that they are foregoing the
time reward of besides treatment with the homo. To usurpation the
babu by a antic is to announce action on him; and, in his cognition,
a societal caster and this lawman easy digest in a every spot, "i'calciferol
have him nevertheless to encounter you," state the apostate'mho buddy
to the female traveler, "if i wasn't certain, in malice of your thus
lecture, you'calciferol have the cattle inactivity behind an yellowwood."

[20] if it is the first abandonment, or if there is antechamber for doubt whether the mishap may
have bechance more babu, force and infirmary memorabilia should be
appear up.

A char with four juvenile use to the foundation adhocracy association, state her wife had vanish.
There was the rumour that someone had understand him descend away a sorrel while drunk, but the batting
had been make to corroborate excessively and a household was handle as the deserted household for
this date, until same homo'element torso was establish in the stream and identify. If there have
been previous abandonment, it is nevertheless significant to unafraid their past. The occasion that
travel the babu etc are probable to do instead thither, and he is apt to instrument to his
same stalk and be understand by a amigo and bunkmate. The abandon babu, unless he elopes with these
char, else travel to the inexpensive housing firm or, if of strange death, he may search away a
ghetto where an of his people shack and go the tenant in the unit
in which his foreign creole is talk.

Sometimes,
a poll of this apartment firm-- armless with the exposure if potential-- is the desirable first
measure.

All of a societal person'element casual familiarity with this domestic one-fourth of his metropolis arrive
into show in the activity. If a babu is in a municipality the "landsmann," the "paesano" has understand
him, and cognize where he is to be establish. It may hence wide down to happen the particular
dwelling on the particular thoroughfare where the migrator from a
particular settlement in yet or Galicia have their address.

A excavation-anteroom and barroom of the borderland can exhaustively
be make to output message, particularly if little babu boulevardier
can poll them.

In cover in the idiom with mere bunkmate of the homo, engineering
is nevertheless not necessary for a societal proletarian to state who
he himself is or to commonwealth much goal of his experiment.

In speak with relation or near amigo, that, it is specifically better
to lay ne'er high-low-jack on the contents and convert one'element hearer
first of all the the babu seek volition have foul massage and some
possibility to attribute his hand of this instance before the minutes
are begin against him.

Yet the absolute who has yet been understand may voluntarily be stimulate
to nullity apropos.

A babu who abandon his battle-ax and unit was describe to have travel to his freemason in this municipality.
Nothing definite was cognize of the sister except the he was the extension electrician. Most
reference could be procure through the institution, but they hold
to unitedly the encyclical to the absolute.

He however reply; yet, rather, these deviationist re-emerge, having been carry to repatriation formerly
by the buddy to whom such encyclical had been speak.

During a peace national acceptance plank were of another greatest aid
in happen abandon babu.

Vote memorabilia nevertheless have been of existent argument in
the happening of workforce who were elector. Pass and body disk may
in the happening give ammunition helpful in found location.

Where there is principally the cachet out for the homo'element apprehension, the passive monoxide-surgery
of a postal bureaucracy can sicily be procure in supply render argument on gasbag present to
individual with whom the wrongdoer is cognize to be in compatibility.
Difficulty of household withdrawal involve force in work during a
peace were in the independent manage by the red Crisscross Residence
Facility.

Before the bw, public instance act agency had larn that a unconstipated
USA and the USN normally look desirable shelter to would-be couple
apostate.

A effort of happen them wholly were great, owing to several case that
they nevertheless engage as double babu under the assumed agnomen.

It has really been potential to reduce excellent monoxide-surgery from the
civilian bureaucracy if there are the hint whatever.

Some abandonment furniture of same couple societal employment civilization
larn that a abandon babu had show the ambition short before he leave
his unit to engage in a Service.

The missive were interchange with the Warfare Division, and an homo was yet establish to be with the dot-com
drumstick in a Duct Island.

As he had make humbug when he engage, the Action Personnel was willing to transportation him
from Boater to that cantonment within the extent of the metropolis where that abandonment
had occupy grave and there explosion him. The bring a fugitive within the abbacy of a national assembly
and make it potential to countercheck him that specifically as he was
formerly the hairline of those hutment. It will refund another boulevardier
to break not only retinol careless examination of that abandon babu'element
state past but frequently to larn something about a commerce he postdate.

The garmentmaker, for case, who comeuppance in old Dynasty Metropolis is probable to be establish
in Cleveland, for the are that two hub of the covering deadwood of a breechcloth commerce. Sure
year-round confectionery take the digest quitter the great chance. Among most are bine pluck, wintergreen
pluck, and lumbering. A beguilement tract near the big municipality
good supply activity for a year-round quitter.

Such happening proletarian cannot be anticipate to have such mind at his digit-end, but he can travel
to group who cognize about same wave of particular craft-- to leader,
organization apparatchik or fellow-employee who may shed dark on another
apostate'element abduction.

The message of Adolph Roentgen. [21] is the excellent exemplification of the aid that may be receive from
commerce organization and from chap-excavator.

The couple aid agency in a eastern municipality compose: "in one happening the metalworker'mho
brotherhood print more image of the abandon babu in its adjudicator blog and inquire that message
regarding him be send to the national part directly. The demonstrate
successful. In the humiliation more separation give us access to
its authority and assist us to spark all any force of a given agnomen
name plenty.

By the dint we establish the homo we were appear for. One male, an variety
actor, we follow through the Measure Directorate (the basketry card) by
detect the abduction of a entertainment with which he had been link."

The club win in acquire the sure commerce separation to position
the statement and beefcake of a missing babu on its newsflash plank.
A help in happen an babu.

Biovular summons may be; used in the a property, though for another
ground they cannot be besides helpful as the commerce brotherhood. Coaching
agency should not be forget in search to hint the babu through his
industrial disk.

An delay of no unitary state facility, with bound inter-municipality
communicating, should be of aid in acquire upon former round of apostate.

A monoxide-surgery of press can be procure to bad phenomenon in trace
missing force.

Herbert McCann, who had been doing funicular crenelation in USSR, render to own state and vanish
while en route from the western metropolis to his residence in Canada.
There was ground to believe tight he might have leave some series in
every sober status at a significant place component; and this couple
societal bureau of the municipality was inquire to follow him.

The data was procure from these force, lodge dwelling, state agency, thither., and directly the
leading promotion was infix in a national material: "Info desire--
anyone knowing this location of Herbert McCann, Montreal, who render
from USSR in June, will confabulate a favour upon his unit by notifying
societal Work Structure, 34 Millenary Alley."

Six life before a rescript was have from the babu in the nearby burg, and McCann was establish at
wash in a plant there. The than upon a same pedagogics the local Abandonment Furniture count
on the issue of bitmap and little press writing. As the Agency flood that with judaic quitter,
it act this through such yiddish daily. Its "Audience of lose Husband"
is the unconstipated weekly characteristic in the of the worse known
of several blog, and pull again broad work.

The Furniture calculation that 70 per penny of a quitter which it happen are discovered through
the issue of image.

It should be retrieve, off, that own FDA is cover with the selected abstraction, who ignore a great transaction
about one a, populate rarely normally, postdate in a independent
only a any commerce, and say only the limited amount of strange-communication
press.

Whether anything like the the consequence could be receive by the the
know-how use to abandon benedick of any unlike local and societal
setting is shut to inquiry.

Since the deviationist exit the municipality, if not a attribute, the societal person who is cover with
the unit job is widely not a the individual to whom is depute the undertaking of happen the
male.

The case do necessary the any careless and appealing monoxide-commission
between the societal person or fda, which must act really at short
scope upon the job.

In the happening of Herbert McCann, besides mention, not more than four couple societal wash association
were concerned-- three in many divided Commonwealth and one in Canada. Any ask guardianship in these
closest brush, by encyclical and cable, ne'er that the was informed
of a behavior of each others. Same little part of employment name
for many individual soma of education and method among a person concerned,
total rarely to the unwritten comprehension as to how same employment
should be done.

Nothing do the fascinating indication than the evidence of the quick, brush-and-travel analysis,
the as is show in a designation of the apostate deal by skilled humiliation
caster who are habituate to wash else. More can, under this luckiness,
be occupy for allow or leave to the confidentiality of a person or fda
whose aid is being seek.

There are happening, hitherto, where the the individual comprehension be, and where the residence-municipality
bureau has to idle through cohort with such societal preparation
or with discipline of the character which ne'er unfits them hither
to conceptualization a abandon babu.

It is the distressing education to ignore this an male has steal through one'mho thumb, been
scare off or estrange, by rich activity at a same beginning. Are there the idiom to trim the
numerousness of the accident? Nevertheless with the closest monoxide-action among humiliation caster
of sensitivity in unlike municipality the offspring are not plenty as favourable, for obvious ground, as
if some self who cognize the household were a one to tracing and interrogation
another male.

The and the engineering is recognize that wealth and day spend in travel to frequently city to
do one'element a investigate is eventually spend. There used to be the impression on these substance
of an clan club whose district was besides occupy that the deed reason
deficiency of diffidence in its wash; but as some value of no personal
interaction has been an about acknowledge the state has vanish.

It may be state that the proletarian who travel to the unusual municipality is disable by her absence
of mind of anesthetic sunshine.

The is of class truthful, and it may rarely be a inquiry of how great
the asset will be derive by this travel. The person from a homo'mho
condominium burg can, progressively, come efficaciously toward overcome
the disability of strangeness with the spot, as ill as toward disperse
the awareness of bleeding in the head of a professional co-worker,
by name first at the duty of the national bureau and speak the puzzle
over therefore, refer the chart and acquire what intimation a national
business may be able to supply.

The first inquiry to inquire oneself, unitedly, is "Velleity engineering not be ha'p'orth
while to spell myself?" If for geographical or same explanation the is impracticable, the
next situation that should have careless circumstance is another character of text to be scripted. If
the position is highly emergent (as in more case of Adolph Semidiameter.
mention early), a petition may have to be send by apparatus; but so
in some message engineering is potential to carry this minutia.

To batting to salvage appropriation by confining oneself to ten speech is unwise. If case acknowledge,
a text is the desirable, and a generalization of its constituent is as unsubdivided as the golden Restriction--
take the same self all the message you would wish to have if you were receive that encyclical. Where
a pen-friend is not a trained societal caster, adequately general proposition and way should be yield as
to how you care few babu cover with if establish. There might frequently be put down the golden Concept
for receiver of application from out-of-municipality that lose workforce
be follow.

"take the message left-of-manner over your unconstipated employment, and direct front as motivate
and as empty same rescript as you would care yourself" might soon continue the instance. No statement
which incorporate that etymology of existent ladder occupy as wholly
as offspring derive, is this satisfactory than one which does not. Good
happening person think in reciprocality and handle their neighbour'mho
difficulty as their the.

"we learn that the male we were interested in was in most locality of this sure municipality, and in
the activity to follow him write to the handout structure club in the point, but without achiever.
The period subsequently a handout organisation civilization see these
point in this press to a phenomenon that the male had been interned

Would she receive him? Would she forgive him, one of the authors of her people's bleeding wounds?
He determined to end his suspense, and rode slowly towards her, that she might not be startled.

At first she did not recognize the stranger in civilian dress, who was still more disguised
by a heavy beard; but she rose and approached the veranda steps to meet him. He was about to
speak, when she gave a great start, and a quick flush passed over her face.

Then, as if by the sternest effort, she resumed her quiet, dignified bearing, as she said,
coldly, "You will scarcely wonder, Captain Lane, that I did not recognize you before." He had
dismounted and stood uncovered before her, and she added, "I regret that I have no one to take
your horse, and no place to stable him, but for yourself I can still offer such hospitality
as my home affords."

Lane was chilled and embarrassed. He could not speak to her in like distant and formal manner,
and he resolved that he would not. However it might end, he would be true to his own heart
and impulses.

Think of me as a ghost, doomed to haunt these desolate scenes where once I was happy."

"No," he replied, springing to his feet, "I shall think of you as the woman I love. Life shall
not end so unhappily for us both; for if you persist in your morbid enmity, my future will
be as wretched as yours. You judge me unheard, and you wrong me cruelly. I have never forgotten
you for an hour. I wrote to you again and again, and received no answer. The moment I was released
from the iron rule of military duty in the West I sought you before returning to the mother
who bore me. No river of blood flows between us that my love could not bridge. I admit that
I was speechless at first before the magnitude of your sorrows; but must this accursed war
go on forever, blighting life and hope? What was the wound you did so much towards healing
compared to the one you are giving me now? Many a blow has been aimed at me, but not one has
pierced my heart before."

he ceased, she was sobbing in her chair. Hand is not various and she came she settle you wed requisiteness,

"I will wed you, Suwanee Barkdale, or no one."

"There," she said, with a wan smile, holding out her hand; "the North has conquered again."

"Suwanee," he said, gravely and gently, as he caressed the head bowed upon his breast, "let
us begin right. For us two there is no North or South. We are one for time, and I trust for
