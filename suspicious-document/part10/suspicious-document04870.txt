PREFACE

One of the great thinkers of the world has said that all the sciences are embodied in natural
history. Hence natural history should be taught to a child from an early age.

Perhaps the best method of teaching it is to set forth the characteristics of animals in the
form of a narrative. Then the child reads the narrative with pleasure and almost as a story,
not as a tedious "lesson."

I have followed that method in the Wonders of the Jungle. The present work (Book One) is intended
to be a supplementary reader for the earlier grades in grammar schools. If it be found useful,
I shall write one or two more books in progressive order for the use of higher grades.

In Book One I have depicted only such wild animals as appeal to the interest of young children,
and even to their sympathy and love. In subsequent books I shall describe the animals that
prey upon others. As those animals are not lovable, it would be better for the child to read
about them a year or two later. But even to those animals I shall be just, and shall depict
their good qualities as well as their preying habits. How many people know that the very worst
animal, the tiger, is a better husband and father than many men? Or that the ferocity of the
tigress is prompted entirely by her maternal instinct--and that in every case of unusual ferocity
yet recorded it was afterward found that there was a helpless cub somewhere near? Hence in
subsequent books I shall enter more fully into the causes of animal instincts and characteristics--their
loves and their hates and their fears.

Regarding the scheme of Book One, the animals are described in their daily life, and the main
scientific facts and principles concerning each animal are woven into the narrative as a part
of that daily life. But while teaching science to the child in that pleasant form, a few other
purposes have also been kept in view:--

journalist, people, desert, deduction.

 Then they look up at the moon. Do you see what they are doing? Can you
hear them? They are howling at the moon in a chorus. Dogs always howl at the moon. Men do not
quite know just why dogs do that. But perhaps they do it because they are glad and satisfied,
and are trying to sing! When you sing, and there is a dog near by, you may hear him start howling.
He does that, I suppose, because he likes your singing, and wants to join in the chorus!

So the wild dogs of the jungle also howl when they are glad. Then, after the red dogs have
howled as long as a song, they scamper off into the jungle again. That shows, I suppose, that
their howling was really a song!

Other Animals Come Alone

The red dogs are the last of the animals that come in a bunch. Now you see other animals coming
one by one. A sneaking shadow there! It must be a hyena. That is an animal that eats what remains
from some other animal's supper; so the hyena waits to see if a tiger or a leopard has caught
any supper, or else it will have to go hungry.

But hush! Here is a red deer coming carefully to the water. This animal is much bigger than
the blue deer, and more able to take care of herself. But, still, she comes very quietly, looking
to right and left to make sure that the tiger is not just in that place. She reaches the water
and starts drinking. But do you see how her ear is bent to the side? The red deer is listening
most carefully, even while she is drinking!

But look, look! The bush behind the deer parts very slowly, and a huge yellow form crouches
there! It is the tiger!

He is not near enough to jump on the deer; so he takes one step forward--as softly as a cat!

But the deer has heard the footfall! For she can hear even a leaf when it falls to the ground.
And in that one second, even while she was drinking, the red deer has turned and leaped to
the side. The tiger has also leaped at the same time, and he aimed at the place where the deer
was. But the deer has just left that place, and the next second she gives another leap, like
a flash, and gets out of the tiger's reach.

The tiger stands where he leaped, and growls with rage. He knows it would be no use chasing
the deer, as the deer can run much faster. So he stands there, and growls for quite a while.
Then, as he did not get any supper that night, he can at least have a drink. So he drinks and
goes away, still growling.

Now all is quiet at last at the midnight pool, as all the animals have gone away.

The Law of the Jungle--Clear Water for All

But before we leave the place, I want you to remember something. I showed you first the elephants;
they were on our right--that is, down the stream, the way the water flows. And the elephants
drank first among all the animals.

Then all the other animals came to the stream, but more to our left--that is, up the stream.
Why was that? Think!

I shall tell you. By the time the elephants finish drinking by dipping their trunks into the
stream many times, the water begins to get muddy. In fact, after drinking, the elephants jump
into the water to have a bath and a swim, as I shall tell you in the next chapter.

So the water gets muddy near the elephants and all the way down stream from that place, as
the water flows that way. And as the other animals do not want muddy water to drink, they always
go up the stream, where the water is still clear.

That is The Law of the Jungle, though it is not written down in a book, like the laws among
men. The Law of the Jungle says that as the elephants are the lords of the jungle, they shall
drink first: but they must be careful to drink down the stream, so that all the other animals
may have a place higher up, where they can get clear water to drink.

And that law has never been broken, for many thousands of years, among all the different sorts
of animals.

But with men the laws among the different sorts of people, called nations, are often broken,
because some of them want all the best things and the best places, and do not care if they
muddy the water that their neighbors have to drink.

So, my dear children, we can learn many things from the animals, even how to be better men
and women when we grow up.

CHAPTER III

The Elephants' Bath

I have just told you that, after drinking, the elephants jump into the water and have a bath
and a swim. That is, all the grown-up elephants do that, while the little ones stay on the
bank and play about.

But, you may ask, why does not the tiger try to grab one of the little ones then? Because even
when the Mammas go into the water they keep their eyes on the babies, who play quite near by,
so that the Mammas can come to them any minute.

And the Mammas can smell a tiger a little before he gets there, so that they have enough time
to climb out of the water. Besides, the babies themselves can smell the tiger when he is coming;
then they call out to their Mammas by making a queer rumbling sound in their throats, and the
Mammas come to them at once, before the tiger can get there.

So all the grown-up elephants can go into the water, without any worry. And at first they have
a regular shower bath.

How do they do that? Why, each elephant fills his trunk with water; then he curls up the trunk
in the air over his head and squirts the water out, and it falls in a shower all over his body.
You can see how he does it in the picture. All the grown-up elephants do that, and even those
that are half grown.

After the shower bath, they swim about; but the Mamma elephants do not do that. Why? Because
they have to get busy and bathe their little children. They call to the children to stop playing,
and come and have a bath--just as our Mammas do.

How do they call? Why, I must tell you at once that all kinds of animals have a language of
their own. They do not speak exactly as we do, but make different sounds through their mouth
or nose, and each sound means something.

If the Mamma elephant wants to say "Come here," she makes one kind of sound, and the baby elephant
has learned to know exactly what that means. And if the Mamma elephant wants to say "Keep still,"
she makes another kind of sound, and the baby knows also what that means.

In this way all animals can talk among themselves. Of course they cannot say many things, as
we do, but quite enough to tell what they want.

So each Mamma elephant calls to her child to come and stand on the bank. Now, many of our children
often hate to be bathed; and the elephant children are just the same! In fact, the very small
ones actually cry and shriek, just like our babies!

Elephant Child Obeys Mamma--or Gets Spanked

But when the Mamma elephant calls to the baby to stop playing and come and stand by the bank,
the baby comes at once, even though it hates to be bathed. The baby elephant obeys its Mamma
almost the first time, whatever she tells it to do.

But if the baby does not obey, does its Mamma spank it? Of course she does--like all Mammas!
The elephant Mamma does the spanking with her trunk.

But I must tell you at once that an elephant child never gets spanked more than once in its
life--and that is enough! And some are so good that they never get spanked!

The elephant child learns very quickly to obey its Mamma and Papa, and afterwards its trainer
or teacher. The elephant child even obeys the very minute it is told to do anything; in fact,
sometimes in the jungle there is a sudden danger, even if the elephant child does not see the
danger. But its Mamma or Papa sees it.

Then the Mamma or Papa calls out to the child to stop, or come away, or do something, at once;
and if the child does not do it at once, it may get killed. Among men folks, if a child runs
out into the street, and an auto or a street car comes suddenly, then if the child will not
obey its Mamma at once and do exactly as she says, the child may be run over and killed. In
the jungle the elephant child also has sudden dangers like that, though in a different way.

In the next chapter I shall tell you a wonderful story about a boy elephant who escaped a great
danger because he obeyed his Papa at once.

But sometimes it happens that a boy elephant is really naughty--just like a bad boy among men.
As you know, a bad boy among men usually grows up to be a bad man, and then he gets into a
lot of trouble. In the elephant herd it is just the same; a bad little elephant grows up to
be a bad big elephant; it is then called a rogue. In another book I shall tell you how the
President of the herd orders all the police elephants to stand in a ring around the rogue and
give him a most awful spanking. And they do that, not with their trunks this time, but with
their tusks--which hurt most dreadfully.

How the Elephant Child is Bathed

But now I shall tell you about the baby elephant when its Mamma calls it to come and be bathed.
It comes to the edge of the bank, and stands facing its Mamma. Then the Mamma fills her trunk
with water, brings the trunk quite near the baby, and squirts the water all over it.

The baby may howl and jump about and make faces, but it never runs away! Again and again the
Mamma squirts the water, till all the mud and dust of the jungle is washed away from the baby's
body. Then she tells the baby to play about on the bank again, while she attends to the bigger
children.

What has she got to do to them? She must teach them to swim!

Of course all animals with four legs know how to swim naturally; their bodies float in the
water quite easily, and they have only to work their legs to move along in the water. But with
elephants it is a little different. Why? Just think!

I shall tell you. Although they can float quite naturally, their noses point downward right
into the water. As I said before, the elephant's trunk is its nose--that is, the elephant has
to breathe through the trunk. So of course, if in trying to swim a little elephant kept its
trunk down in the water, it would not be able to breathe at all, and would die.

That is why the Mamma elephant has to teach her child how to swim properly. And the way she
does it is quite wonderful.

I must first tell you that the trunk is not only like a nose to the elephant, but also is useful
as a hand; the elephant can hold a lot of things with it, and can even pick up with its tip
a tiny thing as small as a pin.

How the Elephant Child Learns to Swim

So the Mamma elephant stretches out her trunk before her, just like an arm, and tells her child
to lie across it. In that way she holds up the child in the water, so that the little elephant
has only to think of curling up the tip of its own little trunk out of the water to breathe.
Then she tells her child to kick out with its legs, so as to move forward through the water.

But sometimes, in kicking out, the little elephant forgets to hold up the tip of its trunk
out of the water at the same time; then down goes its trunk into the water, and it cannot breathe!

Then what happens? The Mamma elephant can do nothing, as she is already using her own trunk
to hold up her child. So, what is to be done?

Really, the elephants are so wise that they take no chances of that happening. The Papa elephant
takes care of that. When he sees that the Mamma is teaching the little elephant how to swim,
he always comes near them. He may be swimming about, as if he were enjoying himself; but he
is really watching them all the time.

And if the little elephant forgets to hold up its trunk out of the water, the Papa comes quickly,
and with one upward stroke of his own trunk he lifts up the little elephant's trunk clear out
of the water. Is not that very wise and thoughtful of the Papa elephant?

In that way the little elephant soon learns to do both things--that is, to kick out with its
legs so as to move along, and also to hold up its trunk to breathe. And then, of course, it
can swim properly.

And yet the elephants are so very wise that they never take the risk of tiring out a little
elephant, if they have to swim a very long way. Sometimes a whole herd of elephants has to
swim across a very wide river. Then the Mamma elephant tells her child to swim in front of
her, while she encourages the child from behind with many fond words.

But sometimes after swimming halfway across the river--

"Mamma, I am getting tired!" cries the little one.

"Then come on my back, darling!" says the Mamma.

She dives, and comes up right under the little elephant; so now her child sits on her back.
In that way she swims along, and carries her child across the wide river, as you see in the
picture.

CHAPTER IV.

Elephants: The Tricks of the Jungle

Now I shall tell you how a little elephant learns all the tricks of the jungle from its Mamma
and Papa. By the tricks of the jungle I mean all the things that an animal has to learn in
order to get enough to eat every day, what to do when food is scarce, how to be comfortable
and happy, and also how to escape from every danger; in fact, these things are very much like
what men have to learn, only in a different way.

But the animal folks are better off in one way: what they have to learn is not like a lesson
in school, but just play. In fact they learn everything by just playing it as a game! I shall
tell you how.

When a baby elephant is quite small, its Mamma has to feed it with milk. Afterwards, when it
has teeth, she teaches it to feed from the jungle. All elephants eat tender shoots, herbs,
and fresh young leaves; they seize a bough with the trunk, and pull it down in such a way that
the end of the bough reaches right into the mouth.

Elephant Child Learns to Feed

First, the Mamma elephant eats like that from several boughs, while the little elephant watches
her do it. Then she looks at a low bough within easy reach, and says in the elephant language,
"Eat that!"

The little one looks at the bough, grabs it anyhow with its trunk, and pulls it down. But it
cannot get the end of the bough into its mouth! Instead, the bough pokes it on the forehead,
or eyes, or cheeks.

"Hold it straight!" says Mamma, laughing.

The little one tries several times, but still it cannot get the bough to come right. Then its
Mamma puts her own trunk over that of her child, and turns it to right or left, till the bough
comes exactly into the little elephant's mouth.

"You must learn to use your trunk just like a hand," she says. "So you must bend your trunk,
or turn it, or twist it, to get the thing you are holding exactly where you want it."

And that is the first great thing the little elephant has to learn--how to use its trunk as
we use our hands. After that everything else comes easy.

Now I am going to tell you about the childhood of the most wonderful elephant in the world,
who actually lives to-day in the courtyard of a palace in India. He is the biggest elephant
that ever was; that is why he lives in a grand palace, and does nothing except carry a King,
or some other great man, on his back on days of festival.

In fact he was the leader among all the elephants in a long procession at a grand festival
called the Durbar, held in honor of the King of England. On that day a lovely cloth of silk
woven with gold was put on the elephant's back, and around his tusks were placed rings of solid
gold studded with real diamonds, rubies, and pearls.

At another time he carried on his back the Crown Prince of Germany, when he visited India a
few years ago; and at other times he has carried Grand Dukes of Russia and Arch Dukes of Austria
when they visited India.

So you see, he is quite the grandest elephant in the world. He has a real name, just like a
man, and it is written down in books with the names of all the grand officers of the palace.
His name is Salar Jung; so we shall call him Salar for short.

He was born in the jungle, and his Papa and Mamma were quite wild then. It was only after he
grew up that Salar came to live in a palace.

Elephant Child "Swats" Tormenting Flies

But now about Salar's early boyhood. After his Mamma had taught him to swim, to eat from the
boughs of trees, and to drink for himself by dipping his trunk into the water, she had another
useful thing to teach him. In the jungle there are swarms of tormenting flies; they come buzzing
around the elephants, and bother them, just as they bother us. Now, we can whisk off the flies
with our hands, but how about an elephant?

Of course, you will say, his trunk is his hand; and so he can use the trunk to slap the flies
or whisk them off. True, but the trunk will not reach more than halfway down the side of the
body; and the elephant is too stiff to bend his body as we do; and his tail is too short to
reach even a yard each way. Then how can he get rid of the flies where he cannot reach them?
Just think!

If he only could make his trunk longer! But how could he do that? Very simply! Of course he
cannot actually make the trunk longer, but he breaks off a small bough of a tree and holds
it at the end of his trunk; then he uses the bough like a fan, and whisks off, or brushes off,
the flies with it.

And that is what Salar's Mamma taught him to do. After that he was very comfortable.

Not quite; he had just one more thing to learn from his Mamma, to make him quite comfortable.
The sun gets very hot, and when the elephants are feeding from tree to tree, or marching through
the jungle, they feel the hot sun on their backs dreadfully--although they have a thick skin.

Now, how could they guard themselves from the hot sun? Just think!

Why, just as we do, you will say, by using a kind of umbrella! Of course you mean that an elephant
could break off a large bough, and hold it over his head and over his back! But his trunk would
soon get tired of holding anything as big as that! Besides, he has to use his trunk all the
time to feed! If you had only one hand, you could not eat with it and at the same time hold
an umbrella over your head with it! Then how does the elephant manage it?

Elephant Covers his Back from Hot Sun

I shall tell you. He breaks off many small boughs, one at a time, and lays them on his back
with his trunk; he is careful to lay them in proper order, and to criss-cross them, so that
the boughs will not fall off. In fact, he tries to arrange them very much like the thatched
roof of a cottage. That is very clever of him, is it not?

But then he does something else, still more clever! When a cottager builds his thatched roof,
he has to plaster the ceiling to prevent any rain or sunshine from creeping in through the
little spaces between the thatches. So also the thatch on the elephant's back has many gaps,
through which the hot sun can still beat down on his skin. So what does he do to fill up the gaps?

He cannot do anything to plaster his back; but I shall tell you what he does do. He just draws
into his trunk a lot of dust from the ground; then he curls up the trunk over his back, and
blows the dust over the gaps in the thatch on his back. Of course he has to do that many times
to fill up all the gaps; but at last, when he does not feel the sun any more, he knows that
his back is quite covered.

Is not that a very wonderful thing for the elephants to think out, all by themselves? And that
is what Salar's Mamma taught him to do.

But, a few years later, he came to the age when boys among men usually have to go to school.
Then Salar passed to the care of his Papa. In feeding through the jungle, when all the elephants
march and eat from tree to tree, Salar walked with his Papa, and began to learn lessons from
him. And his Papa's way of teaching him was quite different from that of his Mamma, and often
very funny!

How Elephants Walk under Water

The first thing he taught was at the stream at midnight. By this time Salar could swim quite
well; so he was enjoying himself with the grown-ups. But his Papa kept watching him with the
corner of his eye. Little by little he drew nearer and nearer to Salar, and waited till the
youngster came to a part where the water was not at all deep. Then suddenly his Papa gave Salar
a butt with his head. Down went Salar under the water, snorting and spluttering and hollering.

"Hold up your trunk, you simp!" cried his Papa.

But Salar was too frightened to remember to hold up his trunk; so his Papa caught Salar's trunk
in his own and hoisted it clear out of the water. Then what was Salar's joy and surprise to
find that he could breathe quite well, though his feet were actually touching the bottom of
the stream. Of course he kicked out, and tried to get up to the top of the water again. But--

"Stay there!" cried his Papa, giving him another butt, though still holding the youngster's
trunk carefully out of the water.

Then Salar lost all fear of the water; he was not a bit afraid of being ducked, so long as
the tip of his trunk was out of the water. So he learned to do a wonderful thing--he learned
to remain completely under the water, so that his feet were actually resting on the bottom
of the stream, with only the tip of his trunk out of the water. No other animal can do that.

And the most astonishing thing about it is that the elephants have taught themselves to do
that trick; so that a whole herd of elephants can walk into a stream in time of danger, and
disappear from sight, the smaller ones standing in the shallow parts, and the full-grown ones
standing in the deeper parts.

I have known of lots of hunters, who were chasing a herd of elephants and who saw the elephants
run ahead toward a river, to find to their surprise, on reaching the river, that the whole
herd had disappeared as if by magic. They saw nothing, and did not dream that the little things
floating here and there, no bigger than your fist, could mean anything. But of course they
were the tips of the trunks of the elephants hidden under the water.

To have thought out even that one trick for themselves proves that the elephants are the wisest
of all animals, next after men folks. And they have thought out many more tricks, as I shall
tell you very soon.

But now I shall tell you the next trick that Salar's father taught him. An elephant often has
to break down trees in the jungle to clear a way for himself; or sometimes he has to do that
to make an open space where he can lie down comfortably. So this is the way Salar's father
taught him to break down trees.

How Elephants Break Down or Pull Out Trees

First he chose a small tree, not much thicker than your wrist; this he pulled out easily with
his trunk, just as you might use your hand to pull out a small shrub. Then he chose a tree
about six inches thick. He tried it first carefully with his trunk; but the tree was too strong
to pull out in that way.

So the old elephant put his foot on the side of the tree, and pressed with all his weight--as
you see in the picture. The tree bent more and more, and then suddenly broke off near the ground
with a loud crack.

"I can do that!" cried Salar, frisking around his father, impatient to show what he could do.

Salar looked around and saw a tree of about the same size. He made a dash at the tree, put
his right foot on it, and--

His father winked, but said nothing. For all elephants love a joke.

Now the wily old elephant knew that this tree was a banana tree, although the fruit had not
yet started growing on it. The tree looked quite hard and strong, but it was really very soft
and easy to break, like all banana trees. But Salar did not know that yet!

Instead, when he pressed on it with his foot and put his whole weight on it, just as he had
seen his father do to the other tree,--snap went the tree like a twig, and Salar tumbled head
over heels and went rolling over the ground.

"Haw! Haw! Haw!" laughed the merry old elephant. "Did I not show you, silly, how to try it
first carefully, with your trunk, before putting your foot on it?"

"Of course you did!" Salar said, remembering.

"That is what men folks mean when they say, 'You have put your foot into it.' You must remember
never to put your foot into anything before trying it first with your trunk," the old elephant
went on to say. "Now watch me knock down a still bigger tree."

This tree was as thick as a man's body. After trying it first with his trunk and then with
his foot, the wise old elephant put his back on it and heaved. Little by little the tree bent
on that side, but not very much. The elephant stopped heaving, came around and looked at the
tree. Then he began to heave from the other side of the tree.

You have seen a man trying to loosen a nail from a board? He first hits the nail on one side,
and then on the other side; and he goes on hitting the nail from side to side, till it is quite
loose.

Well, that cunning old elephant did just the same thing to that tree; he first heaved the tree
from one side, and then he heaved from the other side; and he went on heaving from side to
side, till he loosened the tree from the ground. Then he pushed the tree with his foot, and
it came out of the ground and fell with a loud thud.

And that is how Salar learned to heave with his body, though of course he could not loosen
so big a tree just yet.

There were many other tricks that Salar learned from his father, and I shall tell you one of
the best of them in the next chapter.

CHAPTER V

Elephants: The Tricky Trap

Salar and his father were going through the jungle, feeding from tree to tree, and from bush
to bush. One day they saw a little clear space and in the middle of it a banana tree--just
one tree. But beautiful bunches of ripe bananas were growing on it from a large stalk.

Salar just loved bananas. In fact, all elephants do, as they cannot get them in the jungle
more than once in many months; for bananas grow mostly in plantations kept by men. So Salar
ran toward the tree joyously.

But the wise old elephant had seen at once that the space all around the tree was rather level
and clear of bushes. That was strange in the jungle, he thought!

Now, why did it look strange? Can you tell? Why was it strange that the space should be all
flat and level, and clear of bushes? Just think!

Because in the jungle that was not natural! In the jungle the space should be all covered with
grass and bushes, or at least with small shrubs of different sizes, just as you have seen in
fields which are allowed to grow wild. So somebody must have made the place level and flat,
and cleared away the bushes! That is what the wise old elephant thought!

Then, also, he had seen that there was just one banana tree, with no other anywhere near it.
That also seemed strange! Why? Because banana trees always grow in groups of many dozens, whether
they are in the jungle or in a plantation.

"Halt!" the old elephant cried, just in time. Salar was not more than five or six yards from
the tree when he heard his father's voice. I have told you before that, when an elephant child
is told to do anything by his Mamma or Papa, he obeys at once, or else he might fall into some
awful danger--just as a child in a town might get run over by an auto or a street car.

So as soon as Salar heard his father's voice, he halted just where he was. And that saved him,
as you will see.

The Elephant Taps Suspicious Ground with his Trunk

His father came up to him, and looked around carefully. Then he tapped on the ground with the
end of his trunk.

"An elephant must always tap with his trunk when he is coming to suspicious ground, before
he puts his foot on it," he said to Salar.

"What does suspicious ground mean?" Salar asked.

"Ground where there might be danger, though you do not see the danger," his father answered.

He went on a couple of yards, tapping the ground before him all the time. Then he suddenly stopped.

"Gr-r-r-rump!" he cried, "it sounds strange and hollow!"

Most carefully he put his foot forward and felt the ground with it, as an elephant always does
when he thinks there is danger. Now the ground bent down a little just where he pressed it
with his foot!

"I thought so!" he muttered.

Then he felt most carefully all along the front edge of the open space, first tapping it with
his trunk, then pressing on it with his foot--of course with the toe end of the foot. And all
along that front edge of the open space the ground bent down a little wherever he pressed it
with his foot.

Then he came to the right side of the open space where the banana tree grew, and tried the
ground there also along the edge. And this ground too bent down a little wherever he pressed
it with his foot.

He came to the back of the open space, and tried it in the same way. And there also the ground
bent down a little along the edge, wherever he pressed it with his foot.

He came around at last to the left side, and tried that also. And there again the ground bent
down in the same way.

"All four sides are suspicious!" he cried. "My son, this is a most tricky trap!"

And though he did not see them, a dozen men were hiding in the tops of trees all around. They
were the hunters kept by a great Prince, who had ordered them to catch the big elephant and
also the young one.

The hunters had first dug a huge pit. It was ten feet deep and twenty-five feet wide on each
side; so it was as big as a large room. Then they had covered the top of the pit by laying
many long bamboos right across from side to side and very close to each other; so it was just
like the roof of a large room. And on the top of the bamboos they had spread a layer of earth--just
like what you have seen in flower beds in a garden; and on that they had planted grass, to
make it look quite natural--only, they forgot that it might look natural for a garden, but
not for a wild jungle. Or perhaps they thought that an elephant would not know any better!

And then they had gone to a plantation and fetched from there a banana tree, with a huge bunch
of ripe bananas on it. They had set up the tree in the middle of that space; and as it would
not keep straight, they had first driven a long bamboo rod right through into the ground, and
then tied the banana tree to the top of the rod.

After doing all that, the hunters were hiding in the trees around. They were watching to see
the big elephant and the little elephant come right up to the banana tree to eat the bananas,
and get caught! For if any elephant stepped upon that place, the top would give way under his
full weight, and he would fall right through into the pit.

But Salar's father grabbed him with his trunk, and pulled him away.

"Come away!" he said. "This is a most hideous trap!"

But Salar, who loved bananas quite as much as you love ice cream, began to cry.

"I want the bananas; I want them; I do, I do!" he kept saying over and over again.

Now his Papa was very fond of Salar, but he did not know how to reach the bananas and not fall
into the pit. He and Salar walked home slowly.

"I must think it over a bit," he said, scratching his head with a bough.

He came there the next day with Salar, and looked all around the place; but he could think
of no safe way to get the bananas. The hunters also came there the next day, for by this time
they were quite excited to see what the wily old elephant would do. In fact, it was from the
chief hunter of that Prince that I heard afterwards what the elephant did do.

I must tell you here that these hunters had been watching the big elephant for many years,
and trying to catch him by different kinds of traps; and that is how we know all about him
and Salar. For when an elephant is very big and has fine tusks, people sometimes try for ten
years to catch him, so that he may be used as the leading elephant of a grand palace.

Almost all the elephants you see in the zoo or in a circus were once quite wild in the jungle,
and have been caught by some kind of trap. They are then tamed, and finally trained to do tricks
that men want them to do. I shall tell you all about that in another book, when you are a little
older.

But now about Salar and his father. On the third day the big elephant came there again, with
Salar; and again the hunters came and hid in the trees around. This time the big elephant looked
farther into the jungle. Then he saw the long bamboos growing in a clump--the very clump from
which the hunters had got the bamboos to make the trap. As the elephant looked at the clump
of bamboos, a thought came slowly into his head.

He pulled out a long bamboo, and returned to the place where the trap was. He stood just outside
the trap, and thought again for some time. Then he held one end of the bamboo in his trunk,
pointed the other end to the banana tree just where the stalk of the bunch began, and gave a jab.

But he did not aim right, and the bamboo slipped off from the stalk. So he tried again, and
gave another jab at the stalk. In this way, after trying many times, he managed at last to
hit the stalk and break it. Down fell the bunch of bananas to the ground.

Meanwhile Salar was jumping around his father for joy. But his father told him to keep still.
He had not succeeded in getting those bananas yet! How could he get them out of the place of
danger?

It puzzled him a long time. He poked at the bunch with the bamboo, but that only broke off
one or two of the bananas. Then he poked at the stalk of the bunch, but the end of the bamboo
slipped off it, as there was nothing on the bamboo to grip the stalk with.

So he drew back the bamboo and looked at that end of it, to see why it did not grip the stalk.
Of course the end of the bamboo was all smooth, and could not grip anything at all.

Elephant Tricks the Tricky Trappers

Then at last another thought seemed to come into the wise old elephant's head. He put that
end of the bamboo into his mouth and began to chew it; for an elephant has very strong teeth
at the back of his mouth. As his mouth was very big, that clever elephant chewed as much of
the end of the bamboo as his mouth would hold--and that was as long as your arm. So the end
of the bamboo became like fibers, that is, like a bunch of hair, only very thick and rough.

Then that cunning elephant sat down on the ground and pushed the bamboo along the ground straight
before him toward the bananas. When the hairy end of the bamboo reached the stalk of the bananas,
he began to twist the other end of the bamboo with the tips of his trunk; for an elephant can
use the tips of his trunk in the same way that you use your fingers.

He twisted and twisted many times, taking care to keep the hairy end of the bamboo pressed
against the stalk of the bananas.

In this way the hairy end of the bamboo got knotted around the stalk. That was just what the
wise old elephant wanted.

Then he pulled the bamboo slowly along the ground, as you see in the picture, taking care to
give one or two more twists in case the knots came undone. He pulled the bamboo lap by lap;
that is, he pulled the bamboo for about a yard, then he let go and took hold of the bamboo
farther up; he pulled again for another yard, and so on. In this way he at last pulled the
bunch of bananas quite out of the trap.

I need not tell you how he and Salar enjoyed that feast!

And the hunters, who were hiding in the trees around, laughed and laughed at the trick the
wily old elephant had played on them! For, as you see, he got the bananas and yet escaped from
that trap! He beat the men at their own game!

But now I must tell you about other animals,--first about buffaloes. They are the brave knights
who helped that timid little lady, the blue deer. They are just as wonderful as the elephants,
in their own way.

CHAPTER VI

Buffaloes: The Knights of the Jungle

There are three or four kinds of buffaloes that live in different countries. The kind that
lives in America you may have already heard about. I am sorry to say that hunters have killed
so many of them, that there are very few buffaloes left in the United States now; and these
few are kept in parks.

"Put up your head!" says the boy. But the buffalo goes on feeding hungrily.

"Put up your head, or I will spank you!" says the boy. But the buffalo still goes on feeding
hungrily.

Then that tot raises his small hand and spanks the huge buffalo on the jaw. The buffalo puts
up his head, and rubs his nose lovingly against the boy.

Well, why not? You have seen a baby pulling his Papa's hair. The Papa just loves the baby all
the more for it. So it is with the buffalo and the little tot. And it would not matter a bit
whether the tot were a little boy or a little girl. The big buffalo is fond of both.

And now I shall tell you a wonderful true story about a buffalo and a boy.

CHAPTER VIII

The Buffalo and the Boy

In a village there were many tame buffaloes, and among them thirty bull buffaloes. The little
boys of the village took charge of them every day. The smartest boy among them was called Gulab.
He was six years of age.

Gulab knew quite well each of the thirty bull buffaloes, and was a friend of each. Sometimes
he alone had charge of them, and took them out to graze and to wallow. That was because his
father was the herdsman.

The buffaloes loved Gulab, and they did exactly as he told them to do. When he was going to
take them to the fields, he would just stamp his little bare foot and call out to them "Stand
in rows!" And the huge animals would stand in rows, one line behind another.

Then Gulab would come around to the side, and see if each line was straight. If the line was
not quite straight, and a buffalo happened to be standing too much this way or that, Gulab
would walk up to the buffalo and spank him on the jaw. Then the buffalo would move into line,
exactly as Gulab wanted him to do. Or, if a buffalo happened to be standing too far behind,
Gulab would come around to the back and twist the buffalo's tail, and the buffalo would move
up into line.

Then, when the whole herd was in the right order, Gulab would come to the front of the herd,
and walk up to the biggest bull.

"Bend down your head, Baldo!" he would order.

And Baldo, the biggest bull, in the middle of the front line, would bend down his head, and
Gulab would climb up by one of the horns, scramble up Baldo's neck, and sit down on his back.

"March!" Gulab would order--and the whole herd would march.

Now, a few miles away there was a grand palace. In the palace was a little Prince, whose father
was a Rajah--that is, a kind of king. The little Prince's birthday was coming, and his father
ordered grand feasts for many days.

The Rajah had six English friends, who were quite big men. The Englishmen were very fond of
tiger hunting, so the Rajah wanted to order a tiger hunt for them. But it is not easy to have
a tiger hunt just when you want to have it. Why not? Because the tiger will not come out and
be hunted just when you want him to. He would rather stay in his den.

So for a few days no one heard of a tiger prowling about. Then suddenly a strange piece of
news came from that village where Gulab lived. It happened in this way:

One day Gulab took out the buffaloes to graze and to wallow. The buffaloes lay down in the
shallow water for a while, and Gulab splashed about or tumbled in the mud near them. Then he
got tired of doing that, and came out on the bank and played about there for a while.

Suddenly he heard a strange sound. It was one of the buffaloes, who had stood up in the water
and was giving a low, deep bellow. Two or three other buffaloes stood up also, and gave a low,
deep bellow. Then all at once the whole lot of them began to come out of the water.

Gulab stopped in his play to see what was wrong. But he could see nothing.

"What's the matter, Baldo?" he asked. "What's wrong, Chando?"

But the two biggest bulls scrambled up the bank, and came rushing toward the boy. All the other
bulls came also, and some went past him on the right side, and some went past him on the left
side. Then suddenly Gulab knew what it all meant!

A snarl--a growl--a roar, he heard. A flash of yellow leaped out of the jungle, and came toward
him with a huge jump. It was a tiger!

But already the buffaloes were making a ring around Gulab. Then he knew what had happened.
The tiger had seen him from the jungle beyond, and had been trying to creep up to him quietly
from thicket to thicket. But the buffaloes had smelled the tiger in time, and had run out of
the pond to save Gulab. And now they had made a ring around him.

Gulab stood in the ring and looked with large round eyes, for he was more frightened than he
had ever been in his life. He was only a little boy, and had never seen a tiger face to face.

The tiger growled and snarled and roared. Then it came round and round the ring, trying to
find a gap between the horns to get at the boy. But there was no gap between the horns.

Then little by little the fear left Gulab's heart. Something inside him told him to be brave.
He walked up to Baldo.

"Baldo, let me up!" Gulab said to him, standing behind the buffalo. And Baldo lowered his body
behind, and bent his hind legs at the knees.

Gulab took hold of Baldo's tail in both hands, and put his foot on Baldo's hind knee, which
was now bent quite low. In that way Gulab climbed up to the buffalo's back, and sat on it,
holding on to Baldo's shoulders.

Then, being quite safe on the buffalo's back, Gulab glanced around and called to the buffaloes
at the back of the ring, "Open out!" And the buffaloes opened out at the back of the ring,
and made a crescent. Then they moved still farther around, and the crescent became one long
line, facing the tiger.

Gulab gave one glance to right and left, to see that all were ready. Then--

"Charge, brothers, charge!" he cried to the buffaloes.

Then his big brothers, the buffaloes, charged with thundering hoofs and fiery nostrils. The
tiger gave a huge leap to the side to get away; but the buffaloes on that side opened out and
headed off the tiger. On to the front again the tiger was forced to turn--and run for his life
before the furious herd.

The buffaloes chased and chased that tiger, across field and jungle, over hedges and ditches,
through brambles and bushes and thickets, till at last the tiger jumped across a ravine and
ran away growling and howling and snarling, like a low thief who is chased out of a village
at night.

The ravine was a deep hollow in the ground, like a huge ditch; and it ran all the way across
the ground; so the buffaloes could not get over it, as they cannot jump as far as a tiger.
Then the buffaloes returned to the village, and Gulab gave the news about the tiger.

Some of the village people ran to the palace, and said that the tiger might be still hiding
somewhere on the other side of the ravine. So the six Englishmen went around to that side to
hunt the tiger. They found him and wounded him four or five times. But it takes a lot more
than that to kill a tiger. The tiger ran out, got past the hunters, and came back again across
the ravine. Here he hid in a dense thicket, and would not come out and be hunted to please anybody.

Now, when a tiger is hiding in a thicket and will not come out and be hunted, there is only
one way to make him come out.

What is that way? Can you tell?

Why, of course, the bull buffaloes!

So the herdsman brought up the thirty bull buffaloes, and drew them up in a long line in front
of the thicket. And on the other side of the thicket the six Englishmen got up into trees,
and pointed their guns at the thicket.

Then the herdsman ordered the buffaloes to charge, and they charged right through the thicket,
trampling it down and cutting it up into lanes; so the tiger had to run out on the other side.
But on that side the six Englishmen were waiting for him; and they all fired at the tiger at
once, and all hit him. They used a kind of bullet that broke up into a hundred pieces right
inside the tiger.

But the tiger still kicked and kicked, and would not agree to be dead at once, as any other
animal would. People say that a cat has nine lives; then a tiger must have ninety-nine lives.
So this tiger jumped about, torn up as he was, and glared at the Englishmen in the trees, trying
to get at them, while they were loading their guns for another shot.

But the buffaloes went on charging, and caught up with the tiger. They rushed upon him, and
now the torn-up tiger could not get away. So the buffaloes trampled upon him, and then the
tiger agreed to lie still and be dead, really and truly.

The six Englishmen began to climb down from the trees, as they thought the excitement was all
over. But the herdsman called out to them at once:

"Please go up again--quick! Don't let my buffaloes see you!"

For I must tell you now that buffaloes do not like strangers. They may be very fond of their
own friends in the village; but if they should see a stranger, they would charge him just as
quickly as they would charge a tiger. And the Englishmen would look quite strange to the buffaloes.

So the Englishmen remembered that, and stayed up in the trees till the buffaloes were taken away.

The buffaloes were taken to the pond; and as the herdsman would not bother to stay with them
there, he left the buffaloes in the pond to do as they pleased till evening.

The six Englishmen had their lunch there, when they got down from the trees. They gave their
guns to their servants, to carry away to the palace. Afterwards the Englishmen walked about,
smoking their cigars, as they did not want to return to the palace so soon.

But four or five hours passed, and still they had not come back to the palace. It was nearly
evening, and still they had not come.

And in the village Gulab said to his Papa, who was the herdsman, "Papa, I shall bring the buffaloes
home now."

He went to the pond. But the buffaloes were not there! He shouted, whistled, and gave all the
buffalo calls he knew. But no answer!

He looked about, and searched everywhere, but he could not see the buffaloes. What had become
of them?

Then he happened to look far to the side, toward a lot of tall trees. Something was happening
under the trees! He could see a lot of things moving there, but he was too far away to see
what they were.

He ran toward the trees. Yes, they were the buffaloes! But why were they there? And why were
they behaving like that?

For he saw that they were pawing the ground angrily, and tossing their heads and rattling their
horns. And what was very strange, the buffaloes were not looking at anything on the ground
in front of them. They were looking up, at the trees!

Then Gulab glanced up into the trees, and saw at once why the buffaloes were behaving like
that. But he did not waste a minute. He ran to the buffaloes, shouting:

"Down, Baldo! Down, Chando!"

But the two biggest bulls and all the others glared at the trees and snorted in fury.

"Down!" Gulab shrieked. "Down, or I shall spank you!"

He rushed to Baldo, and spanked him on the jaw. He rushed to Chando, and spanked him on the
jaw. He rushed from buffalo to buffalo, and spanked each one on the jaw.

Then the huge animals that had charged the raging tiger, and that were now fierce themselves,
obeyed the little boy. They blinked, then one by one lowered their heads. Gulab climbed up
by Baldo's horns, and seated himself on his back.

"Now turn around, all!" he ordered. And the buffaloes slowly turned away from the trees.

Gulab looked back over his shoulder, and said to the six Englishmen who were up in the trees:
"You may come down now. My buffaloes won't hurt you a bit, because if they try to I will spank
them!"

Then the little boy took away the buffaloes, and the six big Englishmen came down from the
trees quite safely.

And now, do you understand what had happened? I shall tell you. The Englishmen had forgotten
what the herdsman had told them--about keeping away from the buffaloes. The Englishmen had
walked about, and had finally come near the pond where the buffaloes were.

Then the buffaloes had come out and charged them. The Englishmen had run and run, and had just
managed to reach the trees. But the buffaloes had come there after them! So the big Englishmen
had to stay up in the trees, and wait for some little village boy to come and take away the
furious buffaloes.

I have told you this story, my dear (and it is a true story) just to show you what kind of
an animal the buffalo is--at least, this sort of buffalo. Even when he is furious, he will
do anything for the little boy whom he loves.

But as it is a true story, I must tell you one more thing that happened--and I am sure you
will be delighted to hear about it. The six Englishmen went to the palace, and laughed and
laughed, and told all about it to the little Prince whose birthday it was.

Then the Rajah, who was the little Prince's father, said that Baldo and Chando should not be
made to plow any more, or do another bit of work in their lives. Why? Because Baldo and Chando
had first helped to save Gulab from the tiger at the pond, and then afterwards they had helped
to hunt the tiger.

So after that, Baldo and Chando were allowed to walk about the village as they pleased, and
nibble at anybody's hay or grass, and splash in anybody's pond, and wallow in anybody's ditch,
rut, or mire.

And what was little Gulab's reward for saving the six Englishmen? Well, the little Prince,
whose birthday it was, came and took Gulab by the hand, and brought him to the grand palace,
and gave him lots and lots to eat--cakes and ice cream and candy--so that Gulab went home that
night very full and very happy.

CHAPTER IX

Deer and Antelope

The buffalo has many relatives among other animals which also have horns. In fact, all animals
that have horns are some relation to each other--first cousin, second cousin, third cousin,
and so on.

The buffalo's nearest relatives are the ordinary cows and bulls that you see in the fields.

"But the sheep and the goat also have horns," you may say. "Are they also cousins?"

Yes, they are. In the same way the deer and the antelope are also cousins to each other. I
am now going to tell you about them.

The deer and the antelope are not exactly the same kind of animal, as you might perhaps think.
As I said, they are only cousins. If you look at them carefully in the pictures on pages 103
and 109 you will see which is the antelope and which is the deer--just as you can tell a sheep
from a goat.

First see the picture on page 103. These are antelope. Look at the horns carefully. They are
something like a cow's horns; only, a cow's horns are sometimes bent and twisted in different
ways. But the antelope's horns point upward, and are much longer than a cow's horns. They sometimes
look almost like a pair of long and thick spikes, pointed at the top.

Now look at the picture on page 109. These are deer. Look at the horns carefully--only, they
are not called horns when the animal is a deer, but antlers, which is a special name. So take
a good look at the deer's antlers. There are two of them, and they grow from the top of his
head, like the antelope's horns.

But look again. The antlers start from the head as two spikes, but higher up each antler branches
out into many parts. In fact, near the top each antler looks something like the branches of
a small tree without leaves.

So now you can always tell which is an antelope and which is a deer: the antelope's horns have
no branches, but the deer's antlers have many branches.

Horns and Antlers Different in Three Ways

The antelope's horns and the deer's antlers are also different in other ways, which you cannot
see in the pictures. So I shall tell you about them:

1. The antelope's horns are hollow inside, and made of the same kind of thing as the hoofs
or nails of an animal, only they are thicker and harder. But a deer's antlers are solid, and
made of bone.

2. Both the Papas and the Mammas among antelopes have horns. But among most kinds of deer,
only the Papas have the antlers; the Mammas have none.

3. Among antelopes, when once the Papas and the Mammas have grown their horns, they keep them
always. But among deer, the Papas throw away their antlers every year, and grow new ones. That
seems very wonderful! I shall tell you more about it soon.

But now I shall tell you, little by little, all the wonderful things the deer and the antelope
can do. I shall begin with the deer, as there are many kinds of deer in America.

Of course, in America there are not such wild jungles as in countries which are hot all the
year round. Still, there are many places in the West and a few other parts of America where
there is some kind of jungle and plenty of forest. A forest is a kind of jungle, only it has
more trees, and fewer thickets; but wild animals can live there just the same.

Elk and Other American Deer

The biggest kind of deer in America is the moose; in fact, it is the biggest kind of deer in
the world. The second biggest is the elk; he is nearly as big as the moose. Some people think
that the moose and the elk are exactly the same kind of deer, but that is not quite correct.
In this book I must not make it too hard for you to understand, by telling you how they are
different. So I shall tell you all about the elk, as his picture is on page 109.

Once upon a time elks lived in all parts of America, but now they have been killed off by hunters
in most parts, and are found wild only in the Far West.

The elk is a fine fellow. At the shoulder he is as tall as a man, and is as heavy as six men.
He lives in places where there is plenty of forest--that is, plenty of trees. Why trees? Because
he needs them in winter--for then the bark is his food!

In summer he has plenty to eat--leaves, twigs, and grass. But when the winter comes, and the
leaves fall, and the ground is covered with snow, the poor elk would starve and die, if he
did not have at least the bark of trees to eat. And very little bark he gets for many days
at a time.

Here I must tell you that some kinds of deer are among the most hardy animals; that means that
at times they can live on very little. There is a kind of deer, called the reindeer, that lives
in the frozen North, where there is snow and ice almost all the year round; and the reindeer
has nothing more to eat for many days than a little bit of moss or seaweed.

But there is another animal, not a deer, that is still more hardy: he can go a whole week without
eating or drinking--and do work all the time! That seems very wonderful. But I shall tell you
about that animal in another chapter.

Now about the elk. His antlers are fine! You can see in the picture how huge they are. And
yet, would you believe it, he grew them in only five months! I told you a little while ago
that a deer throws off his antlers every year, and grows new ones. I shall now tell you how
the elk does that.

In the middle of the winter, the elk's antlers break off bit by bit. In a few weeks they have
all fallen off, leaving the elk's head bare, with just a ridge or rough stump on it. Then,
early in the spring the new antlers start growing from the top of the stump. They grow very
fast, and in five months are as huge as ever.

But while the new antlers are growing, they are not hard. As yet they are soft and tender,
and all that time they have an outside covering like hairy leather, to guard them from harm.
But as soon as the elk feels that his antlers are quite grown, and are strong and hard, he
strips off the outside covering by rubbing the antlers against trees.

Of course, while his antlers are still growing, and are soft and tender, the elk cannot use
them to fight another animal; so during that time he hides in the bushes. But as soon as his
new antlers have become hard and strong, he is very brave again, and is ready to fight!

Does the elk fight much? He does! He fights most awfully when he has his new antlers. What
he fights about, and with whom he fights, I shall tell you in another book.

There are a few other kinds of deer in America, but the funniest of them is called the mule
deer, which lives along the Rocky Mountains. He is called the mule deer because he has very
long ears, like a mule's ears. And perhaps you have seen a mule bucking--that is, jumping about
while holding his legs quite stiff. Well, the mule deer can buck just like that.

And while he is running at a gallop, he will often jump off the ground with stiff legs, and
then hop on and on many times like that, with stiff legs, finishing up with another gallop.

That makes him look very funny, and because he jumps like that people in Canada sometimes call
him the jumping deer.

Other Kinds of Deer

I must now tell you about some other kinds of deer that live in jungles and forests in other
countries.

The fallow deer lives in Europe. When he is wild, he lives in a forest; but when he is tame,
he lives in a park. He is a small deer, about the size of a donkey. His coat is very soft and
glossy and beautiful. In winter his coat looks dark brown, and his legs and the under part
of his body are light brown. But in summer his coat becomes a lovely light red in color, with
white spots jotted all over it. Then he is very handsome.

In India also there is a handsome deer, which the people call the lion deer. He looks quite
gentle and mild. Then why do the people call him the lion deer? Because he has a lovely coat,
golden yellow in color. You could see him far across the open field, if he only stood there.
But he is so timid that he does not often come out in the open.

And why has he a yellow coat? Because he lives in a place where there is plenty of yellow grass;
and if he stood right in the middle of the grass, and did not move, nobody could see him. Even
if a tiger were looking for him, and the deer stood quite still in the grass, the tiger could
not find him.

In another chapter I shall tell you how other animals have on their bodies the color of the
place where they live, or where they want to hide.

Barking Deer--One of the Wonders of Nature

Now I am coming to one of the nicest kinds of deer in the world, and I am sure you will just
love him! He lives in India, and is called the barking deer; only, he is not exactly a deer,
but an antelope. You remember what I have told you before, about an antelope having a different
kind of horns? Still we must call him the barking deer, as people have already given him that name.

He is very small, about the size of a goat. If there is any danger from an enemy, the barking
deer is small enough to hide in any little bush or behind a fallen tree or log; or else he
can run away very quietly through the under bushes. And he runs so quickly that his enemy soon
loses sight of him.

He is called the barking deer, because he can bark or yap almost like a dog. But, you may ask,
why does he want to bark at all, if he is afraid of some enemy? Will not the enemy hear him,
and then catch him?

Yes, that is quite true. And yet the fact that he does bark is one of the most wonderful things
in the jungle. It is so wonderful that in another book I shall tell you more about it. But
now I shall tell you just this:

There are some animals which are so deadly that they could kill off many, many other animals.
So, as the only way to save the other animals from being all killed, God has made some special
animals to fight those deadly animals.

There is the cobra, which is a snake, and which has such a deadly poison that it could kill
almost all other animals in the jungle by just biting them. So, to save the other animals from
being killed by the cobra, God made the mongoose. He is a plucky little creature, about the
size of a cat. And he will fight and kill every cobra he sees! But really he is such a wonderful
animal that I must keep him for another book, when you are old enough to know him better and
to love him.

But sometimes the deadly animal is too strong to be killed himself. There is the tiger. He
can kill and eat many kinds of animals. But who can kill him? No animal! At least, the elephant
and the buffalo could kill the tiger if the tiger should let them catch him and trample on
him. But the tiger does not let any animal catch him. Then how can the other animals be saved
from the tiger?

God made two special animals to save the others from the tiger. The first is the buffalo, of
which I have already told you, and which is the Knight of the Jungle. The second animal is
the barking deer. How the barking deer saves the other animals from the tiger, I shall now
tell you:

When the tiger is prowling about, all other kinds of deer and antelope just run away, and are
glad enough if they escape being eaten. But not the plucky little barking deer! He too runs
away, but as soon as he gets a little ahead of the tiger, he stops under a bush and lets out
that bark or yap--then runs on at once to another bush.

The tiger is furious, and jumps on the bush where he heard the bark--but the deer is not there
now! The deer barks from that second bush--and runs to another one. In this way the barking
deer leads the tiger on and on through the jungle from bush to bush.

And why does he bark like that? To tell the other animals in good time that the tiger is coming,
and then to tell them exactly where the tiger is.

"Look out, here's a tiger!" That is the meaning of his first bark.

"Here he is! He is coming after me--this way!" That is what he means by the next bark.

"He is chasing me this way! You run the other way!" And that is what the barking deer keeps
on saying, as he runs from bush to bush, so that all the other animals know exactly where the
tiger is at each minute.

In this way the barking deer runs through the jungle, warning all the other animals, and so
spoiling the tiger's dinner all the way.

CHAPTER X

Deer and Antelope: Their Special Gifts

You have learned by this time that every animal has some special gift, that is, he can do one
thing better than most other animals. The deer and the antelope have their special gifts.

First, there is their gift of hearing. I have already told you that the wild buffaloes can
hear a long way; but the deer and the antelope can hear still farther.

Let us suppose that a tiger is trying to creep up to a deer through the jungle, as quietly
as he can. The tiger is still a long way off, and quite hidden by the bushes, so the deer cannot
see him at all. But the deer can hear him coming, even if the tiger takes each step very lightly.
Why? Because the deer's ears are so sharp that he can hear even a leaf rustling under the tiger's
foot, a long way off. So the deer can run away in good time.

To make him hear still better, the deer can turn or bend his ears to the side from which the
sound is coming. You have seen an ordinary cow prick up her ears when she heard somebody coming;
and many other animals--even a dog--can do the same.

But the deer can do that best. The shape of his ear is like that of a funnel, so as to pour
the sound into his ear, as it were. Then even if there is only a single drop of sound, it gets
right into his ear.

And by turning or bending his ear, the deer knows which way the sound is coming. You also can
tell which way a sound is coming, if it is loud enough; but the deer can do that even when
the sound is very faint. That is very useful to him, as he then knows exactly which way a sneaking
tiger is coming, and can run the other way.

I must now tell you that the tiger himself, tries to come so quietly that the deer may not
hear him at all; and to help him to do so, his feet are padded with muscles, just like cushions.
So it is a kind of trial between the tiger and the deer as to which is the more clever. If
the tiger can come so quietly that the deer cannot hear him, then the tiger is more clever
than the deer. But if the deer can hear the tiger, even if the tiger comes most quietly, then
the deer is more clever than the tiger.

That kind of trial between two different animals as to which is the more clever, goes on in
the jungle all the time: and the more clever one wins every time. If the tiger is more clever
than the deer, the tiger eats the deer; but if the deer is more clever than the tiger, the
deer escapes being eaten. And that is true of all other animals. In fact, one of the great
wonders of the jungle is that the animal which is the fittest wins the oftenest; and so he
goes on living, whatever may happen to the others.[1]

[Footnote 1: To the Teacher.--Please give the class other examples of the "Survival of the
Fittest" among other creatures--birds, insects, fish, etc.]

Now I come to the second special gift of the deer and the antelope. If by any chance a deer
cannot hear a sneaking tiger, he can still smell the tiger.

Most animals can smell their enemy a long way off, even if they do not hear him or see him;
but the deer and the antelope can smell the farthest. Even if a sneaking tiger is so cunning
that he stops in a thicket and stands quite still for a minute, so that he does not make any
sound at all,--and so the deer cannot hear him,--even then the deer can smell him when he is
still a long way off.

I must tell you now that the tiger himself can smell the deer. But he cannot do that very far
off,--so the deer always smells him first!

Also, the tiger can hear the deer, if the deer happens to be moving. But the tiger cannot hear
quite so far as the deer can. So the deer always hears him first!

But in one thing the tiger is better off than the deer: the tiger can see farther than the
deer. In the night most animals can see a little, but the tiger can see a little better and
farther than the others. And in the daytime, if a deer were feeding in a very big level field,
and a tiger came to the field from the other side, the tiger would see the deer before the
deer could see him. Then the tiger would come round to the nearest thicket, and try to creep
up to the deer from thicket to thicket.

Each Animal has the Gift he Needs Most

So, you understand, the deer can hear farther and smell farther; but the tiger can see farther.

And that is so because it is a wonderful rule in the jungle that each animal has the gift that
he needs most.

But can you think why the tiger needs to see farther, and why the deer needs to hear farther
and smell farther? I shall tell you.

The tiger is the catcher, and the deer is the one that is caught. So the tiger tries to get
to the deer, and the deer tries to run from the tiger.

But to get to the deer, it would be no use to the tiger if he could only smell or hear the
deer, for then he would only know that the deer was somewhere near, but could not find the
exact spot; and to catch the deer the tiger must know exactly where the deer is. So the best
way for him to know that is to see the deer.

But for the deer himself, all that he needs to know is that a tiger is somewhere near. So it
is quite enough for him to know from which side the tiger is coming, by just smelling him or
hearing him. Then the deer can run the other way at once. He does not want to see the tiger at all!

So, you understand, the tiger's best gift is to be able to see the deer; and the deer's best
gift is to be able to smell and hear the tiger.

But then, you may ask, if the deer can always run away long before the tiger can get at him,
does a tiger never catch a deer?

Yes, a tiger does catch a deer once in a while, if the deer happens to make a mistake! And
the deer can make only one mistake like that in his life, because after the first he gets eaten!

So, you may be sure, the deer tries very hard never to make even that one mistake.

And what is that one mistake? It is to run straight into the jaws of the tiger! It may just
happen that when the deer hears the tiger coming, he does not listen quite carefully, and so
he does not know which way the sound is coming. Then, in running away, the deer may happen
to go just the wrong way--and fall into the tiger's jaws.

Or else it may happen that the deer is so frightened that he loses his head, as it were, and
goes just any way--and by bad luck chooses the wrong way, and falls into the tiger's jaws.

But I must tell you that, although the tiger tries very hard to eat the deer, the deer tries
still harder not to be eaten! Why? Because if the tiger does not catch the deer for to-day's
dinner, he can still catch some other animal for tomorrow's breakfast, even if he goes hungry
to-night. But if the deer once gets eaten, there is no to-morrow for, him at all! The tiger
is only trying to get a meal, but the deer is trying to save his life. That is why the deer
nearly always gets away from the tiger--because he is trying harder than the tiger.

So the tiger does not get deer to eat much oftener than most children get roast turkey. The
tiger lives mostly on pork, for the wild pigs of the jungle are such careless animals, as I
have told you before. Now and again the tiger gets mutton also, for the wild sheep are silly
creatures, like other kinds of sheep. In the same way the tiger sometimes catches a wild goat.

The tiger would really get deer to eat a little oftener than he actually does if it were not
that the deer has two other gifts by which he can escape from the tiger at the last minute.
Those two gifts are his quickness in getting started, and his speed in running. So, even if
the deer makes a mistake and runs toward the tiger, he can still escape from the tiger if he
finds out his mistake in time.

For, as you saw at the midnight pool, the deer may be drinking quietly, when he hears or smells
a tiger. Then the deer can leap at once and get away, before the tiger can leap. Or it may
happen that the deer is trying to escape from a tiger and has run to within twenty yards of
the tiger, when he finds out his mistake. Then the deer can turn at once and leap sideways
to get out of the tiger's reach. The deer is so quick that he can turn aside without stopping,
and keep on running.

Then after that, once he has turned away from the tiger, the tiger can never catch him. For
the deer can run ever so much faster than the tiger.

In fact, the deer or the antelope is the fastest animal in the world, except one other. About
that other animal I shall tell you some wonderful things in the next book. But among all animals
I have told you about in this book the deer is the fastest.

"But how do people know that the deer can run faster than other animals?" you may ask. "Has
anyone had a race between different animals?"

Yes, some people did that in England a few years ago. They took the fastest racehorse in the
country, and ran a race between him and the fastest greyhound; and the greyhound beat the horse
in the race. Then they took that greyhound, and ran a race between him and an English deer;
and the deer beat the greyhound in the race. So, you see, the deer was faster than the greyhound,
and the greyhound was faster than the horse! So the deer was the fastest of the three.

And the deer that lives in the jungle is even faster than the English deer. Why? Because the
English deer lives in peaceful glades and forests, and has no other animal trying to catch
and eat him; so he does not try to be as fast as he could be. But the deer that lives in the
jungle has to try very hard all the time to be as fast as he can be, or else he would be eaten
by the tiger! And, as you must know, we can do the best in anything when we try the hardest.

So, all kinds of wild deer in the jungle have been trying their hardest to run as fast as they
can. And as their fathers and grandfathers have been trying to do that, the wild deer to-day
have become the fastest runners among all the animals I have told you about.

CHAPTER XI

The Camel

The camel has very little to do with the kind of jungle I have been telling you about; but
he has much to do with the desert. A desert is another kind of wild place. Not believe than it should never

 Those used for
riding cannot run as fast as a horse, but they can keep on running at a steady trot much longer
than a horse, and then after a short rest can start running again. So by the end of the day
a camel can run twice as far as a horse, and sometimes still farther.

The Camel's Wonderful Gifts

Now I am going to tell you of the most wonderful things a camel can do.

First, I must tell you that no other animal could cross a desert at all. To begin with, if
such an animal as a horse tried to walk on the sand, his hoofs would sink into the sand up
to the ankles, and it would be hard work for him to go even a mile. But a camel's foot is different.
It has a soft pad of muscles under it, just like a cushion; and when the camel walks or runs
on the sand, the pad spreads out under his foot, and that gives him a firm hold on the sand
in walking or running. So remember that the camel has padded feet.

I must tell you here that the feet of all animals are formed in the way they can best use,
in the country in which they live. Those animals that have to walk on hard ground have hoofs,
and those that have to walk on soft ground have padded feet. The elephant is the only animal
that has to walk on hard ground, at least very often, and yet has padded feet. Can you tell
why? Because of his huge weight! He is so heavy that if the bones under his feet were not covered
with a thick pad, he would jar the bones every time he put his foot down, even if the ground
were not very hard.

In the same way the camel's padded foot is very useful to him even when he is not in the desert,
but on hard ground; for he too is rather heavy, though of course not so heavy as an elephant.

There are other reasons why no other animal could cross a desert as easily as a camel. In the
desert there are sometimes fierce storms; and as it is all sand there, the strong wind blows
the sand about in every direction. As there is no place there where one could get away from
the sand, any other animal would soon have a lot of sand blown into his nostrils; then he would
be choked. But a camel's nostrils are made differently, so that whenever he likes he can close
his nostrils, as easily as you can close your mouths, and that keeps away the sand. The camel
is clever enough to lie down on the ground when a storm is blowing, and to lay his neck and
chin along the ground; then his nose is quite close to the ground, where the storm is not quite
so fierce as in the air.

Of course, when he wants to breathe, he opens his nostrils a tiny bit to take in a little air;
then he closes the nostrils again, and holds his breath for a little while. He has to keep
on doing that as long as the storm lasts.

But what does his master do, who has been riding on his back? He cannot close his nostrils;
so the only thing he can do is to get off the camel and huddle against the camel's body on
the side far from the wind; then he brings his face quite close to the ground and holds his
nose with his hand. When he wants to breathe, he opens his fingers just enough to make a slit
and let the air in, but not enough to let the sand in.

There is another reason why no other animal could cross a desert: his eyes would be blinded
by the fierce glare of the sun. But a camel has very thick hair on his eyebrows, which hang
over the eyes, and keep off the fierce rays of the sun. His eyelashes also are very thick,
and help to keep off the sun in the same way.

But there is a still more wonderful reason why no other animal, except a camel, could cross
a desert. In a desert water is very scarce, and a traveler crossing a desert on a camel may
not find any water for a whole week. Of course, he carries on his saddle half a dozen bottles
of water to drink; but after drinking some of the water each day, he has not much to spare
for the poor camel. Then what is the poor camel to do?

Of course, you may say that his master should carry more water for the camel to drink. But
the load of goods which the camel has to carry is already so heavy that there is not much room
for any more water. Then what can the poor camel do?

Why, he carries his own drinking water, not in the load on his back, but inside his stomach!
Is not that a wonderful thing? His stomach is made differently from that of any other animal.
The stomach of any other animal, Or even a man's stomach, is so made that the water drunk at
any time is all used up in the next few hours; that is why any other animal, or even a man,
has to have another drink after those few hours.

But a camel's stomach is so made that it has one big place for food and drink like the stomach
of any other animal, but it also has many smaller places arranged all around the stomach; these
smaller places are just like bottles, and are called cells.

So when a camel takes a good long drink, the big place in the middle of the stomach takes in
the water first; then as he drinks more and more, the bottles or cells all around begin to
get filled also. And the wonderful thing is that as soon as each cell is full, its mouth closes
up by itself! In that way, if the camel drinks long enough, all the cells get full, one by
one, and then have their mouths closed up.

When a camel is about to start on a long journey through the desert, he takes a very long drink,
till he feels that he cannot drink any more; then he knows that all the bottles or cells inside
are quite full, as well as the big place in the middle of his stomach. Now he is ready to cross
the desert.

After many hours all the water in the big place in the middle of the stomach gets used up.
Then what happens? Why, one of the bottles inside opens its mouth by itself, and pours the
water into the stomach! And after many hours more, when that water has also been used up, the
second bottle opens its mouth and pours the water into the stomach. In this way all the bottles
or cells inside the camel one by one pour their water into the stomach from day to day, whenever
the camel feels thirsty. Is not that most wonderful?

And there is yet another very wonderful thing about the camel. His hump! It is just as wonderful
whether it is one hump or two humps. I shall tell you.

The camel's hump is his store of food! Yes, just as he carries his own drinking water inside
his stomach, so he also carries his own store of food in his hump.

This is how he does it:

When the camel is quite well and strong, if he eats any food which is a little more than he
actually needs for his hunger, that food after a while goes to his hump and helps to make it
bigger. In this way the hump becomes a store of all the extra food that he has eaten. Then,
on going on a long journey through the desert, if the camel has nothing to eat and begins to
feel hungry and weak, a little of the hump is used up to give him strength, just as if he were
to eat a meal. In this way he can go for many days without food, but of course his hump will
get smaller and smaller.

But his master does not actually take him through the desert without giving him any food or
drink; in fact he always gives the camel some of the figs and dates which he takes with him
for his own meals, and also some of the drinking water which he carries on his saddle. But
if it did happen that his master had no food or drink to spare, the camel could still live
for several days, using his hump for food, and the water in the cells of his stomach for drink.

The camel can do yet another wonderful thing. He can tell a long way off when he is coming
to a place where there is water. In the desert, after going over sand and sand for many days,
a traveler sometimes finds a beautiful place called an oasis. It is just like a lovely little
garden right in the middle of the desert, with a spring of water, and several fig trees, date
trees, and other palm trees growing all around the pool.

When a traveler is crossing the desert and sees nothing but sand for several days, it sometimes
happens that his camel suddenly stops, stands quite still for a minute, raises his head, and
sniffs the air. Then he turns a little to the right or to the left, and begins to run straight
that way. His master may look ahead very hard, but he will see nothing but sand and sand, as
before.

But the camel, by just sniffing the air, has found out that there is an oasis within reach,
though it is still too far away for him to see it. Then he runs on most gladly, and comes to
the oasis in an hour, so that he and his master can rest there for some time, and drink from
the pool, and eat the figs and dates growing on the trees.

Of course, the camel can also eat the leaves of the trees; in fact, when he is not in the desert,
but just in the ordinary country, he usually eats from the shrubs and bushes, and gets figs
and dates only as a dainty, just as you sometimes have ice cream. The camel with two humps
will gladly eat many more things than the camel with one hump. In fact, when he is hungry,
he will eat not only any kind of vegetable, but also meat. He has even been known to chew up
and eat bones, blankets, and leather! And he is perhaps the only animal that will drink salt
water; for the country in which the Two-Humps camel lives has several lakes, the water of which
is bitter and salty.

So you see how useful an animal the camel is, whether he has one hump or two humps. He is so
useful that people have been saying for a long time that camels should be brought into America,
where there are several deserts in the western states. In fact, a strange thing has already
happened. The United States Government did bring a lot of camels for use in the western states
several years ago, about the time when your grandfather was a boy.

But the people who can best manage such large animals as elephants and camels are the people
who are born in the same countries as those animals and who understand their habits. And unluckily,
when the camels were brought into America, nobody thought of bringing men also from those countries
to manage the camels. So nobody seemed to know how to use these animals, and after a time they
were turned loose in Arizona. The camels went into the deserts and forests there, and became
quite wild, and to-day there are some of them in Arizona.

Now, do you not think it would be a good idea to get a few men from those countries and learn
from them how to manage camels? Then the camels of Arizona also could be used in crossing the
deserts there, where there are no railroads.

Besides being the only animal that can cross the desert, the camel is different from any other
four-legged animal even in the way he walks.

You have seen how a horse walks? When his left foreleg is lifted off the ground, his right
hind leg is also lifted off the ground; then in the next step, when his right foreleg is lifted
off the ground, his left hind leg is also lifted off the ground. That means that the two legs
which move at the same time are those placed at the opposite corners of his body. But when
a camel walks, he lifts the two legs on the same side of his body at the same time. And when
he takes the next step, he lifts the two legs on the other side of his body.

Now, my dear, I have told you many things about the camel which are different from anything
in any other animal. So, before I close this chapter, I want you to remember these things about
the camel:

1. His foot is padded in such a way that he can walk or run on sand.

2. He can close his nostrils to keep out the sand in a storm.

3. His thick and bushy eyebrows and thick eyelashes keep the glare of the sun from his eyes.

4. His stomach has many cells like bottles, in which he can store up water.

5. He can store up food in his hump.

6. He walks by moving both legs on the same side of his body at the same time.

In another chapter I shall tell you about an animal that can also do one of these things: he
can store up food in his body, though in a different way. That animal is the bear. He sleeps
through the whole winter, and has to have a store of food somewhere in his body to last all
that time.

CHAPTER XII

The Camel and the Thief

Now I shall tell you a story about a camel and a thief. It is a true story, and happened many,
many years ago. The story shows what we can learn by watching the animals.

Once upon a time, a traveler was going on foot across the country. In his belt he had a purse
full of money. One day, as the sun began to get hot, he lay down on the grass under a tree
near the roadway, and fell asleep.

After a few hours he woke up, and what was his surprise to find that the purse was gone! While
he was asleep, somebody had quietly stolen his purse and gone away.

The traveler ran to the nearest village, and there told the police about it. Now, among the
police there was a very clever man, and the police brought him with them to the place where
the money had been stolen. The clever man looked all around the place very carefully to see
if he could find any marks on the ground. On the grass near the tree he found no marks; in
fact, if a person walks on the grass just once or twice it does not leave any mark. But on
the roadway near by he found footprints.

"They are a camel's footprints," he said, looking at the marks carefully. "And the marks of
all the four feet are not quite the same. Three of them are quite deep and clear; but the fourth
one is very faint."

He followed the camel's footprints along the road for a long time. But now and again he stopped
and looked at the shrubs and bushes which grew here and there, on both sides of the road.

"Hello, that is strange!" he suddenly said. "The camel has eaten from the bushes and shrubs
here and there on the left side of the road, but he hasn't eaten at all from those on the right
side of the road."

He went on for some time longer, then suddenly stopped to look at the road where the camel
had walked.

"Hello, this is also strange!" he said. "Here are a lot of bees buzzing near the ground on
the right side of the road. And here are a lot of ants scrambling over the ground on the left
side of the road."

"Never mind about the camel, and the bees and the ants," the policemen said impatiently. "We
want to know about the thief who stole the money. You have not found any other footprints except
the camel's?"

"That is quite true," the clever man said. "But as the camel could not steal the money, there
must be a man riding on the camel. He must be the thief."

"But why didn't the thief leave any footprints?" the policemen asked.

"Because he must have ridden his camel from the roadway right to the edge of the grass," the
clever man answered. "Then he must have jumped down upon the grass, where he knew he would
not leave any footprint. He must have walked very quietly on the grass up to the tree where
the traveler was sleeping, and stolen the money. Then he must have walked back quietly to the
camel and ridden off."

"But what sort of a man is the thief?" the police asked. "How can we find him, if you do not
tell us what he is like?"

"I cannot tell you a thing about the thief, or what he looks like, as he hasn't even left a
footprint," the clever man answered. "But I can tell you all about the camel. The camel is
blind in his right eye, and lame in his left hind foot. And on his back he is carrying two
packages, one on each side; the package on the right side has honey in it, and the package
on the left side has corn in it. So you must search for a man who is riding a camel loaded
like that. He is the thief."

So the police searched for a man who was riding a camel which was blind in his right eye, lame
in his left hind foot, and carrying honey in a package on his right side, and corn in a package
on his left side. After following the camel's footprints on the ground for a long time, the
police at last came to a village.

They searched through the village, and found many men riding camels. So the police knew that
he was the thief, and took him before the judge. Then the thief said that it was quite true
that he stole the money.

Afterwards the judge turned to the clever man and asked him how he knew all that about the camel.

"You didn't see the camel at all, but only his footprints," the judge said.

"It was quite simple," the clever man answered very modestly. "First, about the camel being
blind in his right eye. He had nibbled at the shrubs and bushes growing on the left side of
the road, for at each bite I found the leaves cut off clean by his teeth. On the right side
of the road there were also plenty of good shrubs and bushes, but the camel had not taken a
single bite at any of them. That showed that he did not even see those shrubs and bushes on
his right side. And that of course meant that his right eye was blind."

"That is very clever of you," the judge said. "But how did you know that the camel was lame
in his left hind foot?"

"That was just as simple," the clever man again answered very modestly. "As the camel walked
along, the marks of his two front feet and right hind foot were quite deep and clear on the
ground. But the mark of his left hind foot was very faint. That showed that the camel was limping,
and the left hind foot only just touched the ground. So I knew that he was lame in that foot."

"That is also very clever of you," the judge said. "But how did you know that the camel was
carrying honey on his right side, and corn on his left?"

"That was the simplest of all," the clever man answered most modestly. "As the camel was limping,
nearly every step he took jerked the load on his back. So a few drops of the honey fell to
the ground from the package on his right side, and a few grains of the corn fell to the ground
from the package on his left side."

"But you could not see very well here and there on the ground just a few drops of honey or
just a few grains of corn?" the judge said.

"I could not," the clever man answered, "but the bees and the ants could! On the right side
of the road I found a swarm of bees here and there; so I knew that they were trying to pick
up the honey. And on the left side of the road I saw a whole lot of ants here and there; so
I knew that they were trying to pick up and carry away the grains of corn."

Now was it not really clever of that man to find all that out about the camel, without ever
seeing the camel before? But, as you understand, he knew all about the habits of different
animals; and so he knew what camels and bees and ants always do.

CHAPTER XIII

Bears

Bears are such funny animals, at least some kinds of bears, that you may like to know all about
them.

Bears are found in many countries, and in some countries there are several kinds of bears.

But you must remember this: hardly any bear lives in the tropics; that means countries where
the sun is almost overhead all the months of the year, so that it is very hot all the time.

But why does not the bear usually live there? Can you guess?

Because the bear is a very hairy animal; and his hair is just like a thick coat, so that he
cannot live where it is very hot all the time.

Of course, once upon a time the bear lived only in places where it was very cold, and so he
grew thick hair to keep out the cold; but now that he has a thick coat of hair, he cannot go
down to hot countries to live. He does not mind living in a cold country; and the colder the
country is, the thicker is his coat of hair.

What does the bear eat? Most kinds of bears eat berries, fruits, soft roots of trees, and fish
when they can catch it. One or two kinds of bears eat other things also, which I shall tell
you about very soon.

The bears that live in cold countries, where there is heavy snow in winter, cannot get anything
at all to eat in winter. Why? Because there are no fruits and berries in winter, and the roots
of trees are frozen hard and covered up by the snow.

Then if those bears cannot get anything to eat in winter, what do they do? They sleep!

You know that when you are asleep you do not feel hungry; but as soon as you wake up you feel
hungry again. It is just the same with the bear; he does not feel very hungry while he sleeps.
And he sleeps right through the winter months!

Still, while he is asleep all that time, does he not feel a little bit hungry? He does. So
he uses up the store of food inside his body! I have told you that the camel carries a store
of food in his hump. The bear has no hump, of course, but he has a thick chunk of fat all around
his body just under his skin; and that chunk of fat is his store of food.

So, when the bear sleeps snugly in his den in the winter months, the chunk of fat is slowly
used up inside his body, and keeps him from being very hungry.

Of course, he eats such a lot just before the winter, that the chunk of fat is very thick when
he goes to bed. But the chunk is all used up when he wakes up at the end of the winter, and
then he is very hungry again!

But there is a kind of bear that lives in a place where there is snow and ice almost all the
time. What can he do?

He cannot sleep always! So he has to get something to eat now and then, and I shall tell you
how he does that.

The Polar Bear

This kind of bear is called the polar bear. (See the picture on page 155.) He lives in a place
far up North, where it is always very cold. The land is nearly covered with snow, and the water
at the top of the sea is frozen. There are no berries or fruits there for the polar bear to
eat; so he has to live on fish, and seal, which is a water animal. The way the bear catches
the fish or the seal is this:

He makes a hole in the ice with his paws, so that he can reach the water below. Then he sits
down very quietly by the edge of the hole, and waits for a fish or a seal to swim past the
hole. Then the bear pounces on it very quickly with his paw or his jaws, and catches it.

If the ice is too thick for the bear to make a hole through it, he has to try another way.
He comes right down to the part of the sea where some of the ice has broken off. There he chooses
a place at the edge of the ice, close to the water; and he waits there for a fish or a seal
to swim past. Then he pounces on it and catches it.

Now I shall tell you a few special things that the polar bear has.

His coat of hair is much thicker than the coat of any other bear. Why? Because he lives in
a colder place than any other bear; so he needs a thicker coat. Also, he sometimes has to swim
through the icy water to get to some floating field of ice, so that he can catch fish from
it. Then, although his hair gets wet, he has a thick lining of fat inside his coat to keep
him warm.

The next special thing about the polar bear is that his hair is all white--like the color of
everything around him, which, as I have told you, is just snow and ice. So when the polar bear
sits down very quietly on the snow and ice, nobody can see him even from a short distance,
because he is the same color as the snow and ice. And that is why the fish or the seal does
not see him, and so gets caught.

That is one of the wonderful things about many wild animals--they are of the same color as
the place where they live. You know that the color of a lion is yellow, like the color of sand;
and the lion lives in countries where there are lots of sandy places. You know, too, that the
color of a tiger is yellow, but with black stripes upon the yellow, so that if you looked at
him from a distance, you might think he was made up of yellow and black stripes. And the tiger
lives in the tall grass, which also looks like yellow and black stripes.

But now I shall tell you more about the polar bear. He has three other special things: the
soles of his feet are hairy; he has a small head; and he has a long neck.

First, about the soles of his feet. The soles of the feet of other bears are smooth, just like
the feet of all other animals that have to walk on ordinary ground. But the soles of the polar
bear are covered with long hair, just as is his body. Why? Because he has to walk on ice, which
is very slippery, and he needs to have the soles of his feet covered with hair, or else he
would slip on the ice, just as you must wear rubbers over your shoes when you have to walk
on icy ground.

Now, my dear, just stop for a minute, and think. Among all the wonderful things that I have
told you so far, you have always noticed that an animal always has just the very thing he needs!
We have to make rubbers, and warm coats, and gloves, and socks, and a dozen things that we
need. But to every animal God has given everything that he needs, right on his body.

But now let us go on with the polar bear. He has a smaller head than any other kind of bear.
Why? To make it easier for him to put his head through the hole in the ice, when he is catching
fish. Other kinds of bears do not have to put their heads into a hole to get anything to eat;
so they do not need to have a small head.

The polar bear has also a longer neck than any other kind of bear. Why? To give him a longer
reach in catching the fish with his jaws--without tumbling into the water himself. Other bears,
who live on dry land, do not need to reach out like that, and so they have shorter necks.

I shall now tell you about these other kinds of bears.

American Bears

First you shall hear about the bears that live in America. The biggest kind is called the grizzly
bear. In fact, he is the largest bear in the world. Some grizzly bears are ten feet tall when
they stand up on their hind legs!

The color of a grizzly bear is yellow, but with many shades; sometimes between brown and yellow,
and sometimes between red and yellow. Teddy bears, with which you have played, are sometimes
made of that color. Teddy bears of course are very nice, as they are toys; but I am sorry to
say that the real grizzly bear is not nice; he is very fierce. In fact, he is the only kind
of bear that is so fierce. Even grown-up men do not want to go near him.

The grizzly is found in many parts of North America, near the Rocky Mountains, from the United
States right up to Alaska. He lives on berries and all kinds of fruits, and also on the soft
roots of trees. But the grizzly bear eats meat also, if he can manage to catch deer or cattle.
That is why cowboys in Colorado and Wyoming do not like the grizzly bear--he tries to kill
and eat their cows.

Besides, he kills a lot of fish. In the Columbia River in Oregon there are lots of trout and
shad, which people like to have for their dinner. But the grizzly bear gets to the river first,
and eats a great many of the trout and the shad. How does he catch the fish? Why, he just lies
down along the bank, and waits for the fish to rise to the top of the water. The trout and
the shad like to rise to the top of the water now and again, and swim there. So the grizzly
just waits for a fish to rise--and then he pounces on it and catches it with his paw. He is
so very quick that he hardly ever misses. All kinds of bears are very clever in catching fish.

Other Bears

Another kind of bear is called the brown bear. He lives in Europe, Asia, and also in some parts
of America, especially in Alaska. There he is rather big, though not quite so big as the grizzly
bear. He too lives on berries, fruits, and roots, and he also catches fish. For in the rivers
of Alaska there are lots of salmon.

But the brown bear is not at all fierce, like the grizzly bear. He is peace-loving, and sometimes
quite friendly.

The nicest kind of bear is called the black bear. He is found in all parts of the United States,
and in many other countries. He is sometimes rather small, and is quite full of fun. Almost
all the good stories you may hear about bears are about the black bear.

Many people mistake the black bear for the brown bear; so when you sometimes hear people talking
about a "brown" bear, you may know that they really mean a "black" bear.

Like other bears, the black bear lives on berries, fruits, and roots, and also on nuts, if
he can find any. But what he likes best is honey! It is quite amusing to see the bear hold
a honeycomb in one paw, scoop out the honey with the other, and put it into his mouth. It looks
just like a boy holding a pot of jam in one hand, and sticking his fingers into the jam and
putting it on his tongue!

"But do not the bees get angry, and try to sting him?" you may ask.

Of course they do. The bees swarm around the bear and try to sting him all over. But they cannot!
He is too hairy! They cannot get through the hair to sting him on the skin. So he goes on licking
the honey and smacking his lips!

The black bear is always a funny animal. Perhaps you have seen him in the zoo. Leer-out when person.

The peacock is found wild in India and in countries near there, but has now been brought into
America and Europe. You may even have seen the peacock in the parks and gardens of some cities,
where he lives quite peacefully, at least in the summer months. In the winter, of course, he
must have a warm place indoors.

The peacock is really the Papa bird, and the Mamma bird is called the peahen. She has not the
gorgeous tail and the lovely feathers that he has; so she looks quite plain. You will find
that among animals the Papas are often much prettier than the Mammas.

That seems very strange, does it not? Among us, of course, the Mammas are always prettier than
the Papas!

But in another book I shall explain why the Papas among animals are often prettier than the Mammas.

The Golden Pheasant

There is another beautiful bird which has been brought to America, and now lives here; it is
the golden pheasant. Once upon a time he lived only in China; but a few years ago people brought
a number of golden pheasants to America, and put them in the forests of Oregon and Washington.
So now there are many thousands of golden pheasants flying about and making their nests there.

There are other kinds of pheasants in England and in some parts of Europe, and these the people
shoot and eat. But the golden pheasant is much too beautiful to eat. His feathers are as lovely
as the sunset--gold and yellow and orange, with blue and deep crimson; and all these colors
are laid out on his feathers in such a beautiful pattern that to look at him you would think
you were dreaming, and not looking at a real bird.

Man, who toils with his hands, cannot make such lovely colors as those of the birds of the
air, and of the flowers in the fields, which do not toil.

The Snowy Egret

And now, my dear children, I shall finish this chapter by telling you about a beautiful bird
that once lived quite wild in great numbers in the United States. This bird has lovely soft
feathers, which are pure white; so it is called the snowy egret. The feathers are as soft as
silk. They are also long, with a gentle droop at the end.

Because these feathers are so lovely, rich women want to wear them in their hats; and these
rich women are willing to pay a great deal of money for the egret feathers. So, for the sake
of the money, hunters go wherever these lovely birds are to be found, and catch and kill them,
and get the feathers. In fact, they have killed off so many of these lovely birds, to get feathers
for rich women's hats, that to-day there are hardly any snowy egrets left in the United States.

Worse than that, the hunters killed the Papa and Mamma egrets just when their babies were born,
because at that time the feathers of the snowy egrets were the softest and loveliest. And so,
for each Papa and Mamma egret which the cruel hunters killed, they left a dozen baby birds
in their nests to starve and die. Think of that!

Now, my dear children, I want the little girls among you to remember this, especially the little
girls who are lucky enough to have rich Papas and Mammas. You can grow up to be beautiful,
and look beautiful, without wearing these egret feathers. There are women who try to look beautiful,
but who do not think of the pain they give to God's innocent creatures.

So, if ever you want to wear egret feathers, think of the dozen baby egrets who must starve
and die if you are to have them.

CHAPTER XVI

The Caged Parrot

I shall finish this book by telling you a story--a true story, which, I hope, will make you think.

Many years ago a sea captain returned to his home in the north of Scotland, after sailing the
sea for a long time. He brought with him a parrot. The pictures of the patron in daily and the Testament,
or of the patron who know Buffalo our Benefactress, and of weakness
were heard by who him when about condition, which would put themselves
for us does in the framework, may there meditate himself off crush
were tamed in danger.

The loft of belief, what are young buffaloes to the Evangelists, and the column, "which, as the
food of article, are chief to the Heads, prophet, but sufferer," they may quite turn than us am so
be of independent and young pond of what we have been deliver. Such
stream worship in citrate is one of dint which Christ Jesus have
collection for helping and salve power.{ one} as it are assist by
Safety.

You must be by engineering say others. Let us see, it, have been also, plenty at engineering, as
him is bring into said rock stand by church.

The Transept.-- a transepts there are the substance were kept of

Couple
to mammas, running the one in arena, the true buffaloes to the studio, they could complete how
the structure. In the weaponry of Saviour as he came for us thought. The ends may here help us
saw, merely, as we idolise a, the thought to stand it do, that our
being to be truly been supposed must have been the Crucifix on them
does.

It was by proffer ourselves in household that Incubus Christ', and
it is by arranging ourselves to him am of shape, at actuality-area,
and by christian (at ego to himself) to others for behalf, that we
does prompt they outside the just been frantic grass how he inquire
to lineation.

That proffer of ourselves can also be hang not thus by our calls in
nonexistence of idolise whenever he heard, but too by our quarter, in sentinels.
Outward, therefore, the code near pick. s is some mud, through deification,
in stuff from others-- the koinonia.


He flapped his wings against the bars, and finally dropped to the floor of the cage, dead.
He had died in the thought of his bygone happy days.

My dear children, I am closing this book with this story, because I want you to learn a great
lesson from it: be kind to all animals.

I know that you would never willfully hurt any animal. But that is not enough. You may think
that you are very kind to some creature, because you feed it and pet it; but all the same you
may be very cruel, though you do not mean to be so.

You may think it is great fun to have a pretty bird in a cage. But is it any fun for the bird?
How would you like to be shut up in a cage all your life, instead of playing about in God's
free air and living in your own home? The bird wants to fly about and live in his nest in his
own home land. Think of that when you wish to put a bird in a cage. 

This is frequently pad.

The Chasuble, sometimes called "the alb" by property of line, is deliver
only at the affair of the Communion. It is oval in dimensionality,
without bow, with an pocket in the late through which the caput may be
passed. Then
I shall tell you many more Wonders of the Jungle.

Till then, as they say in the Orient, God and His peace be with you!
