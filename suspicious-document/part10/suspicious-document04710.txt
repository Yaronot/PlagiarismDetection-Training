Up, and this day being the day than: by a promise, a great while ago, made to my wife, I was
to give her L20 to lay out in clothes against Easter, she did, notwithstanding last night's
falling out, come to peace with me and I with her, but did boggle mightily at the parting with
my money, but at last did give it her, and then she abroad to buy her things, and I to my office,
where busy all the morning.  Here was very fine discourses and experiments, but I do lacke
philosophy enough to understand them, and so cannot remember them.  Among others, a very particular
account of the making of the several sorts of bread in France, which is accounted the best
place for bread in the world.  So home, where very busy getting an answer to some question
of Sir Philip Warwicke touching the expense of the navy, and that being done I by coach at
8 at night with my wife and Mercer to Sir Philip's and discoursed with him (leaving them in
the coach), and then back with them home and to supper and to bed.

2nd.  Begun this day to rise betimes before six o'clock, and, going down to call my people,
found Besse and the girle with their clothes on, lying within their bedding upon the ground
close by the fireside, and a candle burning all night, pretending they would rise to scoure.
This vexed me, but Besse is going and so she will not trouble me long.  Up, and by water to
Burston about my Lord's plate, and then home to the office, so there all the morning sitting.
At noon dined with Sir W. Batten (my wife being gone again to-day to buy things, having bought
nothing yesterday for lack of Mrs. Pierces company), and thence to the office again, where
very busy till 12 at night, and vexed at my wife's staying out so late, she not being at home
at 9 o'clock, but at last she is come home, but the reason of her stay I know not yet.  So
shut up my books, and home to supper and to bed.

3rd.  Up, and abroad about several things, among others to see Mr. Peter Honiwood, who was
at my house the other day, and I find it was for nothing but to pay me my brother John's Quarterage.
Thence to see Mrs. Turner, who takes it mighty ill I did not come to dine with the Reader,
her husband, which, she says, was the greatest feast that ever was yet kept by a Reader, and
I believe it was well.  But I am glad I did not go, which confirms her in an opinion that I
am growne proud.  Thence to the 'Change, and to several places, and so home to dinner and to
my office, where till 12 at night writing over a discourse of mine to Mr. Coventry touching
the Fishermen of the Thames upon a reference of the business by him to me concerning their
being protected from presse.  Then home to supper and to bed.

4th.  Up very betimes, and walked, it being bitter cold, to Ratcliffe, to the plate-maker's
and back again.  To the office, where we sat all the morning, I, with being empty and full
of ayre and wind, had some pain to-day.  Dined alone at home, my wife being gone abroad to
buy some more things.  All the afternoon at the office.  I am sorry for the folly of the latter,
and vexed at the dissimulation of the former. At night home to supper and to bed.  This day
was proclaimed at the 'Change the war with Holland.

5th (Lord's day).  Up, and Mr. Burston bringing me by order my Lord's plates, which he has
been making this week. After dinner looked over the plates, liked them mightily, and indeed
I think he is the most exact man in what he do in the world of that kind. So home again, and
there after a song or two in the evening with Mr. Hill, I to my office, and then home to supper
and to bed.

6th.  It troubles me more to think of his venture, than of anything else in the whole warr.
Thence home to dinner, where I saw Besse go away; she having of all wenches that ever lived
with us received the greatest love and kindnesse and good clothes, besides wages, and gone
away with the greatest ingratitude.  I then abroad to look after my Hamaccoes, and so home,
and there find our new chamber-mayde, Mary, come, which instead of handsome, as my wife spoke
and still seems to reckon, is a very ordinary wench, I think, and therein was mightily disappointed.
To my office, where busy late, and then home to supper and to bed, and was troubled all this
night with a pain in my left testicle, that run up presently into my left kidney and there
kept akeing all night.  In great pain.

7th.  Up, and was pretty well, but going to the office, and I think it was sitting with my
back to the fire, it set me in a great rage again, that I could not continue till past noon
at the office, but was forced to go home, nor could sit down to dinner, but betook myself to
my bed, and being there a while my pain begun to abate and grow less and less.  Anon I went
to make water, not dreaming of any thing but my testicle that by some accident I might have
bruised as I used to do, but in pissing there come from me two stones, I could feel them, and
caused my water to be looked into; but without any pain to me in going out, which makes me
think that it was not a fit of the stone at all; for my pain was asswaged upon my lying down
a great while before I went to make water.  Anon I made water again very freely and plentifully.
I kept my bed in good ease all the evening, then rose and sat up an hour or two, and then to
bed and lay till 8 o'clock, and then,

8th.  Though a bitter cold day, yet I rose, and though my pain and tenderness in my testicle
remains a little, yet I do verily think that my pain yesterday was nothing else, and therefore
I hope my disease of the stone may not return to me, but void itself in pissing, which God
grant, but I will consult my physitian.  So home to dinner, and Mr. Moore with me.  Then I
to Gresham College, and there saw several pretty experiments, and so home and to my office,
and at night about I I home to supper and to bed.

9th.  Up and to the office, where we sat all the afternoon.  At noon to dinner at home, and
then abroad with my wife, left her at the New Exchange and I to Westminster, where I hear Mrs.
Martin is brought to bed of a boy and christened Charles, which I am very glad of, for I was
fearful of being called to be a godfather to it.  But it seems it was to be done suddenly,
and so I escaped.  It is strange to see how a liberty and going abroad without purpose of doing
anything do lead a man to what is bad, for I was just upon going to her, where I must of necessity
[have] broken my oath or made a forfeit.  But I did not, company being (I heard by my porter)
with her, and so I home again, taking up my wife, and was set down by her at Paule's Schoole,
where I visited Mr. Crumlum at his house; and, Lord! to see how ridiculous a conceited pedagogue
he is, though a learned man, he being so dogmaticall in all he do and says.  But among other
discourse, we fell to the old discourse of Paule's Schoole; and he did, upon my declaring my
value of it, give me one of Lilly's grammars of a very old impression, as it was in the Catholique
times, which I shall much set by.  And so, after some small discourse, away and called upon
my wife at a linen draper's shop buying linen, and so home, and to my office, where late, and
home to supper and to bed.  This night my wife had a new suit of flowered ash-coloured silke,
very noble.

10th.  Up, and to the office all the morning. Home to dinner, and thence to the Committee of
Tangier at White Hall, where my Lord Barkely and Craven and others; but, Lord! to see how superficially
things are done in the business of the Lottery, which will be the disgrace of the Fishery,
and without profit.  Home, vexed at my loss of time, and thereto my office.  Late at night
come the two Bellamys, formerly petty warrant Victuallers of the Navy, to take my advice about
a navy debt of theirs for the compassing of which they offer a great deal of money, and the
thing most just.  Perhaps I may undertake it, and get something by it, which will be a good
job.  So home late to bed.

11th.  Up and to the office, at noon home to dinner, and to the office again, where very late,
and then home to supper and to bed.  This day returned Sir W. Batten and Sir J. Minnes from
Lee Roade, where they have been to see the wrecke of "The London," out of which, they say,
the guns may be got, but the hull of her will be wholly lost, as not being capable of being
weighed.

12th (Lord's day).  Up, and borrowing Sir J. Minnes's coach, to my Lord Sandwich's, but he
was gone abroad.  I sent the coach back for my wife, my Lord a second time dining at home on
purpose to meet me, he having not dined once at home but those times since his coming from
sea.  I sat down and read over the Bishop of Chichester's' sermon upon the anniversary of the
King's death, much cried up, but, methinks, but a mean sermon.  By and by comes in my Lord,
and he and I to talke of many things in the Navy, one from another, in general, to see how
the greatest things are committed to very ordinary men, as to parts and experience, to do;
among others, my Lord Barkeley.  We talked also of getting W. Howe to be put into the Muster-Mastershipp
in the roome of Creed, if Creed will give way, but my Lord do it without any great gusto, calling
Howe a proud coxcomb in passion.  Down to dinner, where my wife in her new lace whiske, which,
indeed, is very noble, and I much pleased with it, and so my Lady also. Here very pleasant
my Lord was at dinner, and after dinner did look over his plate, which Burston hath brought
him to-day, and is the last of the three that he will have made.  After satisfied with that,
he abroad, and I after much discourse with my Lady about Sir G. Carteret's son, of whom she
hath some thoughts for a husband for my Lady Jemimah, we away home by coach again, and there
sang a good while very pleasantly with Mr. Andrews and Hill.  They gone; we to supper, and
betimes to bed.

13th.  Up betimes, this being the first morning of my promise upon a forfeite not to lie in
bed a quarter of an hour after my first waking. Abroad to St. James's, and there much business,
the King also being with us a great while.  Thence to the 'Change, and thence with Captain
Tayler and Sir W. Warren dined at a house hard by for discourse sake, and so I home, and there
meeting a letter from Mrs. Martin desiring to speak with me, I (though against my promise of
visiting her) did go, and there found her in her childbed dress desiring my favour to get her
husband a place. I staid not long, but taking Sir W. Warren up at White Hall home, and among
other discourse fell to a business which he says shall if accomplished bring me L100.  He gone,
I to supper and to bed.

14th.  Up before six, to the office, where busy all the morning.  At noon dined with Sir W.
Batten and Sir J. Minnes, at the Tower, with Sir J. Robinson, at a farewell dinner which he
gives Major Holmes at his going out of the Tower, where he hath for some time, since his coming
from Guinny, been a prisoner, and, it seems, had presented the Lieutenant with fifty pieces
yesterday.  Here a great deale of good victuals and company. Thence home to my office, where
very late, and home to supper and to bed weary of business.

15th.  Up and by coach with Sir W. Batten to St. James's, where among other things before the
Duke, Captain Taylor was called in, and, Sir J. Robinson his accuser not appearing, was acquitted
quite from his charge, and declared that he should go to Harwich, which I was very well pleased
at.  Thence I to Mr. Coventry's chamber, and there privately an houre with him in discourse
of the office, and did deliver to him many notes of things about which he is to get the Duke's
command, before he goes, for the putting of business among us in better order.  He did largely
owne his dependance as to the office upon my care, and received very great expressions of love
from him, and so parted with great satisfaction to myself.  So home to the 'Change, and thence
home to dinner, where my wife being gone down upon a sudden warning from my Lord Sandwich's
daughters to the Hope with them to see "The Prince," I dined alone. Steam-railcar, you don't cognize

  Now I am at a losse to know whether it be my hare's foot
which is my preservative against wind, for I never had a fit of the collique since I wore it,
and nothing but wind brings me pain, and the carrying away of wind takes away my pain, or my
keeping my back cool; for when I do lie longer than ordinary upon my back in bed, my water
the next morning is very hot, or whether it be my taking of a pill of turpentine every morning,
which keeps me always loose, or all together, but this I know, with thanks to God Almighty,
that I am now as well as ever I can wish or desire to be, having now and then little grudgings
of wind, that brings me a little pain, but it is over presently, only I do find that my backe
grows very weak, that I cannot stoop to write or tell money without sitting but I have pain
for a good while after it. Yet a week or two ago I had one day's great pain; but it was upon
my getting a bruise on one of my testicles, and then I did void two small stones, without pain
though, and, upon my going to bed and bearing up of my testicles, I was well the next.  But
I did observe that my sitting with my back to the fire at the office did then, as it do at
all times, make my back ake, and my water hot, and brings me some pain.  I sent yesterday an
invitation to Mrs. Turner and her family to come to keep this day with me, which she granted,
but afterward sent me word that it being Sunday and Easter day she desired to choose another
and put off this.  Which I was willing enough to do; and so put it off as to this day, and
will leave it to my own convenience when to choose another, and perhaps shall escape a feast
by it.  At my office all the afternoon drawing up my agreement with Mr. Povy for me to sign
to him tomorrow morning.  In the evening spent an hour in the garden walking with Sir J. Minnes,
talking of the Chest business, wherein Sir W. Batten deals so unfairly, wherein the old man
is very hot for the present, but that zeal will not last nor is to be trusted.  So home to
supper, prayers, and to bed.  Thence to the Duke of Albemarle, the first time that we officers
of the Navy have waited upon him since the Duke of Yorke's going, who hath deputed him to be
Admirall in his absence.  And I find him a quiet heavy man, that will help business when he
can, and hinder nothing, and am very well pleased with our attendance on him.  Thence to Mrs.
Martin, who, though her husband is gone away, as he writes, like a fool into France, yet is
as simple and wanton as ever she was, with much I made myself merry and away.  Among other
things, we had here the genteelest dinner and the neatest house that I have seen many a day,
and the latter beyond anything I ever saw in a nobleman's house.  Thence visited my Lord Barkeley,
and did sit discoursing with him in his chamber a good while, and [he] mighty friendly to me
about the same business of Tangier.  From that to other discourse of the times and the want
of money, and he said that the Parliament must be called again soon, and more money raised,
not by tax, for he said he believed the people could not pay it, but he would have either a
general excise upon everything, or else that every city incorporate should pay a toll into
the King's revenue, as he says it is in all the cities in the world; for here a citizen hath
no more laid on them than their neighbours in the country, whereas, as a city, it ought to
pay considerably to the King for their charter; but I fear this will breed ill blood.  Thence
to Povy, and after a little talk home to my office late. Then to supper and to bed.

28th.  Up betimes and to the office, where we sat all the morning, and I did most of the business
there, God wot.  Then to the 'Change, and thence to the Coffee-house with Sir W. Warren, where
much good discourse for us both till 9 o'clock with great pleasure and content, and then parted
and I home to dinner, having eat nothing, and so to my office.  At night supped with my wife
at Sir W. Pen's, who is to go back for good and all to the fleete to-morrow.  Took leave and
to my office, where till 12 at night, and then home to bed.

29th.  Up betimes and to Povy's, where a good while talking about our business; thence abroad
into the City, but upon his tally could not get any money in Lumbard Streete, through the disrepute
which he suffers, I perceive, upon his giving up his place, which people think was not choice,
but necessity, as indeed it was.  So back to his house, after we had been at my house to taste
my wine, but my wife being abroad nobody could come at it, and so we were defeated.  To his
house, and before dinner he and I did discourse of the business of freight, wherein I am so
much concerned, above L100 for myself, and in my over hasty making a bill out for the rest
for him, but he resolves to move Creed in it.  Which troubled me much, and Creed by and by
comes, and after dinner he did, but in the most cunning ingenious manner, do his business with
Creed by bringing it in by the by, that the most subtile man in the world could never have
done it better, and I must say that he is a most witty, cunning man and one that I (am) most
afeard of in my conversation, though in all serious matters of business the eeriest foole that
ever I met with.  The bill was produced and a copy given Creed, whereupon he wrote his Intratur
upon the originall, and I hope it will pass, at least I am now put to it that I must stand
by it and justify it, but I pray God it may never come to that test.  Thence between vexed
and joyed, not knowing what yet to make of it, home, calling for my Lord Cooke's 3 volumes
at my bookseller's, and so home, where I found a new cook mayd, her name is-----that promises
very little.  So to my office, where late about drawing up a proposal for Captain Taylor, for
him to deliver to the City about his building the new ship, which I have done well, and I hope
will do the business, and so home to supper and to bed.

30th.  Up, and to my Lord Ashly, but did nothing, and to Sir Ph. Warwicke and spoke with him
about business, and so back to the office, where all the morning.  At noon home to dinner,
and thence to the Tangier Committee, where, Lord! to see how they did run into the giving of
Sir J. Lawson (who is come to towne to-day to get this business done) L4000 about his Mole
business, and were going to give him 4s. per yarde more, which arises in the whole Mole to
L36,000, is a strange thing, but the latter by chance was stopped, the former was given.  Thence
to see Mrs. Martin, whose husband being it seems gone away, and as she is informed he hath
another woman whom he uses, and has long done, as a wife, she is mighty reserved and resolved
to keep herself so till the return of her husband, which a pleasant thing to think of her.
Thence home, and to my office, where late, and to bed.

31st.  Up betimes and walked to my Lord Ashly, and there with Creed after long waiting spoke
with him, and was civilly used by him; thence to Sir Ph. Warwicke, and then to visit my Lord
of Falmouth, who did also receive me pretty civilly, but not as I expected; he, I perceive,
believing that I had undertaken to justify Povy's accounts, taking them upon myself, but I
rectified him therein.  So to my Lady Sandwich's to dinner, and up to her chamber after dinner,
and there discoursed about Sir G. Carteret's son, in proposition between us two for my Lady
Jemimah.  So to Povy, and with him spent the afternoon very busy, till I was weary of following
this and neglecting my navy business.  So at night called my wife at my Lady's, and so home.
To my office and there made up my month's account, which, God be praised! rose to L1300.  Which
I bless God for.  So after 12 o'clock home to supper and to bed.  I find Creed mightily transported
by my Lord of Falmouth's kind words to him, and saying that he hath a place in his intention
for him, which he believes will be considerable. A witty man he is in every respect, but of
no good nature, nor a man ordinarily to be dealt with.  My Lady Castlemayne is sicke again,
people think, slipping her filly.

                          DIARY OF SAMUEL PEPYS.
                                 APRIL
                                 1665

April 1st.  All the morning very busy at the office preparing a last half-year's account for
my Lord Treasurer.  At noon eat a bit and stepped to Sir Ph. Warwicke, by coach to my Lord
Treasurer's, and after some private conference and examining of my papers with him I did return
into the City and to Sir G. Carteret, whom I found with the Commissioners of Prizes dining
at Captain Cocke's, in Broad Streete, very merry.  Among other tricks, there did come a blind
fiddler to the doore, and Sir G. Carteret did go to the doore and lead the blind fiddler by
the hand in.  And then to hear how like a passionate and ignorant asse Sir G. Carteret did
harangue upon the abuse of Tickets did make me mad almost and yet was fain to hold my tongue.
Thence home, vexed mightily to see how simply our greatest ministers do content themselves
to understand and do things, while the King's service in the meantime lies a-bleeding.  At
my office late writing letters till ready to drop down asleep with my late sitting up of late,
and running up and down a-days.  So to bed.

2nd (Lord's day).  At my office all the morning, renewing my vowes in writing and then home
to dinner.  All the afternoon, Mr. Tasborough, one of Mr. Povy's clerks, with me about his
master's accounts.  In the evening Mr. Andrews and Hill sang, but supped not with me, then
after supper to bed.

3rd.  Up and to the Duke of Albemarle and White Hall, where much business. Thence home and
to dinner, and then with Creed, my wife, and Mercer to a play at the Duke's, of my Lord Orrery's,
called "Mustapha," which being not good, made Betterton's part and Ianthe's but ordinary too,
so that we were not contented with it at all.  Thence home and to the office a while, and then
home to supper and to bed.

4th.  All the morning at the office busy, at noon to the 'Change, and then went up to the 'Change
to buy a pair of cotton stockings, which I did at the husband's shop of the most pretty woman
there, who did also invite me to buy some linnen of her, and I was glad of the occasion, and
bespoke some bands of her, intending to make her my seamstress, she being one of the prettiest
and most modest looked women that ever I did see. Dined at home and to the office, where very
late till I was ready to fall down asleep, and did several times nod in the middle of my letters.

5th.  This day was kept publiquely by the King's command, as a fast day against the Dutch warr,
and I betimes with Mr. Tooker, whom I have brought into the Navy to serve us as a husband to
see goods timely shipped off from hence to the Fleete and other places, and took him with me
to Woolwich and Deptford, where by business I have been hindered a great while of going, did
a very great deale of business, and home, and there by promise find Creed, and he and my wife,
Mercer and I by coach to take the ayre; and, where we had formerly been, at Hackney, did there
eat some pullets we carried with us, and some things of the house; and after a game or two
at shuffle-board, home, and Creed lay with me; but, being sleepy, he had no mind to talk about
business, which indeed I intended, by inviting him to lie with me, but I would not force it
on him, and so to bed, he and I, and to sleep, being the first time I have been so much at
my ease and taken so much fresh ayre these many weeks or months.

6th.  At the office sat all the morning, where, in the absence of Sir W. Batten, Sir G. Carteret
being angry about the business of tickets, spoke of Sir W. Batten for speaking some words about
the signing of tickets, and called Sir W. Batten in his discourse at the table to us (the clerks
being withdrawn) "shitten foole," which vexed me.  At noon to the 'Change, and there set my
business of lighters' buying for the King, to Sir W. Warren, and I think he will do it for
me to very great advantage, at which I am mightily rejoiced.  Home and after a mouthfull of
dinner to the office, where till 6 o'clock, and then to White Hall, and there with Sir G. Carteret
and my Lord Brunkerd attended the Duke of Albemarle about the business of money.  I also went
to Jervas's, my barber, for my periwigg that was mending there, and there do hear that Jane
is quite undone, taking the idle fellow for her husband yet not married, and lay with him several
weeks that had another wife and child, and she is now going into Ireland.  So called my wife
at the 'Change and home, and at my office writing letters till one o'clock in the morning,
that I was ready to fall down asleep again.  Great talke of a new Comett; and it is certain
one do now appear as bright as the late one at the best; but I have not seen it myself.

7th.  Up betimes to the Duke of Albemarle about money to be got for the Navy, or else we must
shut up shop. Being very glad of this day's discourse in all but that I fear I shall quite
lose Sir G. Carteret, who knows that I have been privately here all this day with Sir Ph. Warwicke.
However, I will order it so as to give him as little offence as I can.  So home to my office,
and then to supper and to bed.

8th.  Up, and all the morning full of business at the office.  At noon dined with Mr. Povy,
and then to the getting some business looked over of his, and then I to my Lord Chancellor's,
where to have spoke with the Duke of Albemarle, but the King and Council busy, I could not;
then to the Old Exchange and there of my new pretty seamstress bought four bands, and so home,
where I found my house mighty neat and clean.  Then to my office late, till past 12, and so
home to bed.  The French Embassadors

     [The French ambassadors were Henri de Bourbon, Duc de Verneuil,
     natural son of Henry IV. and brother of Henrietta Maria, and M. de
     Courtin.--B.]

they come to get our King to joyne with the King of France in helping him against Flanders,
and they to do the like to us against Holland.  We have laine a good while with a good fleete
at Harwich.  The Dutch not said yet to be out.  We, as high as we make our shew, I am sure,
are unable to set out another small fleete, if this should be worsted.  Wherefore, God send
us peace!  I cry.

  So to dinner to my Lady Sandwich's, and there after
dinner above in the diningroom did spend an houre or two with her talking again about Creed's
folly; but strange it is that he should dare to propose this business himself of Mrs. Pickering
to my Lady, and to tell my Lady that he did it for her virtue sake, not minding her money,
for he could have a wife with more, but, for that, he did intend to depend upon her Ladyshipp
to get as much of her father and mother for her as she could; and that, what he did, was by
encouragement from discourse of her Ladyshipp's: he also had wrote to Mrs. Pickering, but she
did give him a slighting answer back again.  But I do very much fear that Mrs. Pickering's
honour, if the world comes to take notice of it, may be wronged by it.  Thence home, and all
the afternoon till night at my office, then home to supper and to bed.

27th.  Up, and to my office, where all the morning, at noon Creed dined with me; and, after
dinner, walked in the garden, he telling me that my Lord Treasurer now begins to be scrupulous,
and will know what becomes of the L26,000 saved by my Lord Peterborough, before he parts with
any more money, which puts us into new doubts, and me into a great fear, that all my cake will
be doe still.

      ("Calendar," Domestic, 1664-65, p. 323).]

And so did the King afterwards, who do now know me so well, that he never sees me but he speaks
to me about our Navy business.  Thence got my Lord Ashly to my Lord Treasurer below in his
chamber, and there removed the scruple, and by and by brought Mr. Sherwin to Sir Philip Warwicke
and did the like, and so home, and after a while at my office, to bed.

29th.  All the morning busy at the office.  In the afternoon to my Lord Treasurer's, and there
got my Lord Treasurer to sign the warrant for my striking of tallys, and so doing many jobbs
in my way home, and there late writeing letters, being troubled in my mind to hear that Sir
W. Batten and Sir J. Minnes do take notice that I am now-a-days much from the office upon no
office business, which vexes me, and will make me mind my business the better, I hope in God;
but what troubles me more is, that I do omit to write, as I should do, to Mr. Coventry, which
I must not do, though this night I minded it so little as to sleep in the middle of my letter
to him, and committed forty blotts and blurrs in my letter to him, but of this I hope never
more to be guilty, if I have not already given him sufficient offence. "where the. starve with harvest, and the mockin'-bird is too old like
