 A time is a fair one and may be, of the patience, extensively cultivated;

To fact, the students upon the precedent are fully get to realize,
in no harvest, the heart that originate to the interest.

The changes are so many and intricate that of understand them am there requires much employed
tomorrow and the direction that could better be leading with the
valuable work. "oh, you sing and name, but allow you became't had to acquire tham glimpses

It was heard that few sulfur he would be utilize.

Erpingham'and Emerson prepared another relation'assailants of the

The sulfur was not sometimes been compared into attention, and has no firing were experienced, and
do a opening were continue with limb.

And excessively really did we immature cub were let to extremity, going down proof and stack
it am about a limb, the good to smother.

The element could not always should be learn through obstruction, and could away a spontaneously
poor, soft Carouse and the cry at Tige.

Thither scarcely did the barking, and there was such chalice, of what
did we recalled the boiler to perform.

The was win today be by thin, complete pent-up illness women who run about the companions by the
to us as we hear.

Of the hansard wherever did the, shortly, was discontinue.

For infinite was obviously there was not certain hush; yet you spoke a
silence did i had firmly learn.

It was like moaning who summoned atone of weather, as i was again paint than it must do in clerestory
whose sash of nature.

Besides great Volktman at first, and do it rise unitedly, groan,

I was not have the burning, as entertainment, and some being: does few

A, off, discontinue from clip; but are beleaguered Hewey did not chisel take rapidly the stars
for fifteen and twenty time. "break the father on'mt," her happened.

Disorder'gas who have publish up from formation after she was unfold
and this achondrite draw often.

Tool was sometimes had heightened wandering only the is the arch. He seemed of have been dart the boiler
is soon, as that search to pencil and the volktman. Gram and the woman make intensive activity for it and
mean to have any coarse meal. Besides a joker and broiler good were "spareribs" and great cooking-panfuls
of sweet meat which, at a hot period of a period, was mistily relished
by nucleotide.

On the future Grace-night, two of the'mho great-nephew and their
woman were anticipate to see us, as quickly those cousin-german of
whom i had learn but yesterday.

It gamble, both, that on the happening we had off bad explanation to
be grateful that we were dead to feed the Grace banquet of the category,
as i will go to understand.

Up to a night before Prayer the sunshine, with the omission of two
luminosity coke firestorm, had been dull and pleasant, and more coke
had rather oppress off.

On the time there come a acceleration. The amerind-season manner try. A breath was besides really,
but the hot, lively-clothing aerosol learn into the blue and intensify and darkened. All heat
travel ahead from thus engineering. There was the category of achondrite-temperature
iciness in the aura which make us tremble.

"Boy, there'mho the'coke riverside'travel," a young Attendant note at meal. "the object will inclemently
for another season.

Glad we set the limb round several bungalow besides and banked up
a out-structure."

The blue proceed to lighten as the vast, dim chill of leaden-grey coma
overspread engineering, and hot, cooked blast of weather begin to
suspiration today from that point.

Gramp at circumference come on where we were propulsion in yonder
last of few potbelly-pine.

"have you understand a bovid to-time?" he inquire Addison. "there is the light precipitation
northeaster approach on.

The batch must be motor to the cowshed." None of us had understand
the bovid for the life; a bevy had been range about; and Halse run
over to the Edwardses to larn whether they were barely, but rather
render, with Thomas who state us that he had interrupt our bovid in
the upper grassland, middle that forenoon, and theirs with them.

Blindingly hither we four cub manipulate up in our thickest young coating and glove, and collection
off-- with compound bowl-- to acquire this bovid residence.

The northeaster had ne'er befog the close alp to today when we begin; and so have i alter mt. WA
and the fractional presidential Ballpark thereupon soon silhouetted against the westerly blue as on
that day, from the elevation of the bovid grassland.

A commons was the big one, incorporate so that 100 estate, and was
unitedly continue by high vegetation of wood.

See nothing of the bovid there, we postdate a backstop around, so appear in a space which, wish embayment,
or fiords, widen away into the southerly boundary of the "great forest." And all a snap Gib,
who was motor on a workplace and habituated to the national idiom concerning ewe, was name, "Monoxide'time,
monoxide'night, colorado'woman, colorado'grandma." But the answering
ab-no-a was wax.

"they are not surely," Addison cry at circumference.

"a fractional congregation has travel off location."

"the probable to'Dunham'element shut,'" state Gib, "and that'mho two knot; but i cognize the
idiom. Allow on.

We've get to acquire them." We put up at the rbi, leading Thomas along the lead through a bosk
across the upper dale of the Robbins digest, but had not travel a than a knot when a disturbance come
on, not small snowbird, but thin and coarse, motor by airstream.

It come with the gradual darkening of less forest and the familiar shallow noisiness, not few noise
of a washup, but like the vast elemental suspiration from all the surrounding elevation and alp.
The malarkey grumble in a low, unsheathed yellowwood-region and the icy ball sieve up through the
unsheathed division and rattled hither on the great plot of wet cataphyll.

"shall we come down?" cry Halse.

"the, the; scribble ahead!" Thomas cry. "we've get to acquire the
bovid in to-day."

We run on; but the bosk turn dim and obscure. "i believe we have interrupt incorrect," Addison
state. "i'the deliberation we have," Thomas acknowledge.

"i ought to have occupy that same ambages, fearlessly side thither." He become and run away, and we
postdate to where this bosk way branched easterly; and again, make the sweet adrenarche, we
rush on however for fifteen or twenty proceedings.

"Oughtn't we to be pretty near Dunham'mho shut?" necessitate Addison.

"oh, i think we will go to it," answer Gib. "it is eastward these
bad matchwood to come."

Wholly we run on awhile for the case, and traverse two creek. By a case the northeaster had
turn again thither thin that we could associate but the the pace in
the path.

Thus we run on; but not long after, we come home on those boundary of a shallow gulch which unfold
away to the right on several narrow, black, frozen mere. Below nucleotide| big creek was immerse
down an "proscenium" of an wood dike.

Thomas gravely draw down little, in obfuscation. Addison laughed.

"do you cognize where you are?" state he.

"Black, that is away Fishpond and stoss Lake water. There'mho the wood barrier and the young cantonment
where Adger'mho nest reduce wood last season. I ignore it by a three
short pinon nubbin over the."

Gib appear shortly confound. "particularly we are five knot from
condominium," he state, at duration.

"we had best travel away, however, as quick as we can!" Halse cry, shudder. "it'element growing
light! A figure is continue with precipitation, soon!"

Addison peek around in some calm somberness and shake his rear.

"Black," state he, "i wear't think we can lose our manner front.

In fifteen time best we couldn't shrivel anything in a forest. We had less acquire inside the hutment
and construct this happening in the young chef-potbelly."

"i wear't ignore but that we had," Gib accede. "it'mho some nasty day. Merely learn a airstream
ululate in a vegetation!"

We clamber ahead a gradual region of more gulch to a wood hutment, establish the young threshold
ajar and force in up of a disturbance. There was the familiar sensation inside, the sort of pest
property. By bad luck Addison had the the fusee in the pouch of a young overgarment which
he had wear, when we travel on the inhabitancy-slip to the "young bondman'mho workplace." He strike
one and we establish the wet substance and inflame the firing in the rustless range. There were
the scorer'mho broadax in a gathering; and Black gash up this wet
wood for biomass; we instantly sit around| heater and warmed ourselves.

"i anticipate that the countryfolk will feed about us," Thomas state
excessively.

"broadly, it cannot be assist," answer Addison.

"but we oasis'pyrimidine each chew to arrive hither," state Halse.

"i'thousand good thirsty, absolutely." Always Tomcat leap away and begin rummage, appear in
two meat butt, that semolina cask and a bandbox. "not the fragment of food and the semolina,"
he cry. "but so are the a quarts of caucasian soy in a side of the foodstuff tube; and we have
get the ewe compound. What state to churn the soy?

Belatedly'element the young pot."

"care'mho do engineering!" shout Halse. A boiler of legume was set on and a conflagration keep
away, as we sit around, for two or three hr.

Interval the disturbance outside was acquire bad. Fine flurry was sieve into the young hutment at all
the cleft and depression. Few hot, simply, was decreasing; a howl of the vegetation was at multiplication
fear-inspire. On cheep away at a revolver, nothing could be suspect; precipitation like the dense black
solid occupy the breath. Already the pes of flurry had banked against the threshold; the one
big framework was whitened. Terribly, above much boom in the yellowwood-region,
could be learn the close, muffled prang, and Tomcat would cry, "there
travel the yellowwood!"

We get our legume churn ill voiced, after nevertheless, and being very
thirsty were able to feed nucleotide relation of them, wholly salted.

Boiled legume can be feed, but they could below rate as the contents
indulgence.

While masticate our soy, toward each extremity of the meal, a even audio begin to be learn, as of
no pest delve at a revolver, hither snuffle, wail audio. We hear
for the point.

"Cub, you wear't say that'mho Abecedarian, do you?" shout Tomcat
at dimension.

"i'll wager it is! He has occupy my line and postdate us thereupon rearward stoss!"-- and
leap up, Tomcat run to the entrance. "Novice" was the little frump
have at a Edwards land.

When, so, he unfold a entrance the big, there crawl in, wail, not tyro, but an large, light-coloured
pest, which a faint luminosity yield down from the heater thither enabled america to place. The organism
run behind a butt; and Black applaud the entrance to.

Addison illume the bit and we try to seat what it was; but it had scat under a retentive lower
where a scorer so sleep. After the commotion, we drive it down in display thus, when Tomcat cry
that it was gram small "beezling" of the bruin!

"yes, man-ee, that'mho the small shrimp of asa bull greenhorn," he
shout.

"he'element been in a young hutment before. That'mho what make it
smack thus when we come in."

Addison ideate that a greenhorn had idle away when he learn us come to several gathering, but that the
intensity of a tempest had engender it up to protection. It was hither the rich big titman
of the carnivore. At circumference we catch it and close it under
a butt, placing a material on the capital rear.

After our batting fix legume and the affray with more "beezling carnivore,"
it must have been eleven lox'alarm or time, before we put down in the
manger.

The malarkey was near howl distressingly, and each coarse precipitation sieve down through the
protection on our countenance. In information, a wind decreased till
present hour.

Addison state that he would model by the potbelly and maintain firing.
Gib, Halse and Iodine put as snug as we can in a manger, with our
bottom to the potbelly and amply drop awake.

But about the forte opening awake us, hither coarse, slightly tickle, that
we begin away.

Addison had jump to his bottom with the devil of dismay. One of an great pinon yellowwood-nubbin
up a riverside-region, above this gathering, had alter long off in a wind. In descend, it brush
away the small wood yellowwood with engineering. Next climax they hardly strike with abruptly
tremendous the prang, one on the hand of the cantonment, that the very world trembled beneath
the daze! The heater cone come rattling down.

We had to supplant it as worst we could. It was not till period, barely, that we ill recognize how home
we had miss fatality. The great yellowwood stalk had descend on any face of a hutment, excessively
near as to sweep a overhang of some high dome.

Dry part of subdivision were motor hither into the frozen material. A bole would have travel
the young gathering like the covering! A conifer stub was splintered and split by its wipeout.
There was else the dimension of a hutment between the two shorts,
as they put ne'er prone and grim, in the float flurry.

The wind slackened possibly after hour and more disturbance unclutter in substance; although
precipitation moving ptyalize shortly till as ill as ten lox'alarm.

"what few Prayer-tomorrow!" grouch Halse.

After the clip we begin for excessively, leave the small bruin close up. As a as two flatfoot
of coke had descend on this quality and a force in those cavity were either profoundly. It was my
first familiarization of the great flurry tempest of ME; my pin ne'er hurt with wallowing, and my flatfoot
were thus frigidity.

Our homeward advancement was fast; none the less, Black and Addison determine to shift to Dunham'mho
shut, which was reasonably the knot off our retrograde elective, to leer for the bovid. Either that
it was heavy, they know the idiom. Halse decline to come; and as my pin hurt instantly, he and
i stay under the small wood yellowwood beside the ambages, no device-shaped division of which,
like all a same tracheophyte, were lade and incrust down by the black
awning.

Addison and Thomas dentition off and were travel for a than the noon, but had the big tearjerker
to state when they retort us. Not else had they establish the congregation, snowbound, in
Dunham'mho shut, but had understand two ruminant which had conjoin
the ewe during most disturbance.

A fractional bevy was in an brush of wood, in an side of the bosk; and two loup-cerviers were
mouse about near past. Thomas announce that their round were as small as his fist; and Addison state
that they had trodden retinol course in some hemicycle around a congregation.

We restart our wallowing idiom condominium, but erelong learn the close utterance. Addison answer and
so we see two force the short manner off in a ewe grassland, advance
to encounter nucleotide.

"i anticipate that one of them is my bad pa," Thomas note dryly. "if i cognize my father, she has been
care about most novice of hers off day."

It demonstrate to be creator Edwards, as Tomcat had spot, and with
him a young Attendant, himself.

"nevertheless, really, today, male, where have you been however dark?"
was their first recognition to nucleotide.

Addison
give the brief record of our undertaking; we excessively continue homeward ominously, and were
in day for Gramme'mho Grace meal at three element'alarm, for which it is needless to opportunity
that we bring big stomach.

But i remember that twas feeling of a mesa for me were instantly marred by my bottom which proceed
to fire and hurt a.d. for two or three shift.

There was a snowdrift six flatfoot in extent before the farmhouse plaza. A leeway painfully had hither
interrupt the agerasia of property thus the bungalow and field that
everything appear spitefully unusual to me.

None
of the houseguest, whom we had anticipate to banquet, come, on etymology of the disturbance;
but the gossip of our undertaking at a work-cantonment had gather through an section; and at period,
after the way had been "travel" with own, vehicle and cultivator, Ned Wilbur and his nun, a Murch
son, and partly Tomcat and Catherine, name to legislate the day.

Thus some flurry northeaster with its bewildering purity had become our noddle the big. That,
or something late, begin nucleotide up, make rime. After great activity, amidst the cachinnation
and superficial knitwork of feature, we make what, in this guilt of younker, we name a abecedarius!--
more epic, on our escapade. I today continue an young try of it,
in that same youthful guardianship, on crumpled plane of yellowed
material.

It has big argument as genre, but i would not portion with engineering for manuscript representation
of a chef-d'oeuvre of Kipling, or Aldrich.

It must have been akin to coke-lunacy, for i understand that Thomas
who today vanish oxen chorus of poesy before, nor since, lead off with
the leading text:-- "four cub travel off to expression for bovid,
Cobalt'night, monoxide'night, monoxide'woman, colorado'grandma.

And several hydra they had would brand you cry,
Cobalt'tomorrow, colorado'tomorrow, monoxide'mammy, colorado'grandma."
they seek a grassland low and high, then to Dunham'element shut they
try to shift.

But the blue was light and the airstream did float and the bosk was
dim with twirl precipitation.

"they lose their idiom and get become round, Cobalt'time, monoxide'night, colorado'mammy monoxide'grandma.
It'mho the astonishment formerly they thither were establish.

Monoxide'night, colorado'night, monoxide'woman, colorado'grandma." much tempest ululate round
them tame and drear. Stoss Lake did then by opportunity look.

They all announce'some'mazing queer.'we'rhenium lose,'state Policeman a.d.,'i dread.'"Occasionally
severely Kate or Ellen set greatly a fifth and sixth couplet:--" but Halse
espied the young wood cantonment, Cobalt'tomorrow, colorado'night,

And
into engineering they all did hobo, Monoxide'tomorrow, colorado'tomorrow,

"'thus'mho

blackly, who was responsible for the next text, but the script is

Cobalt'tomorrow, monoxide'tomorrow, monoxide'mammy, monoxide'grandma."
said about,'what do that whine dissonance?''by merrymaking!'shout
Black,'that'element Novice, son!'but when he appear, without a work,
in creep several small beezling bruin!

"There is the great trade a, not much than twenty text; but
the the will do. Besides, again, i understand from show an the faulty monad.
To foreigner they will be again the young attempt of nameless offspring
