It is true that at the same time there was so little order about him at Slawkowo, that his
guard burned, during the night, to warm themselves, the bridge which they were ordered to guard,
and the only one by which he could, the next day, leave his imperial quarters. This disorder,
however, like many others, proceeded not from insubordination, but from thoughtlessness; it
was corrected as soon as it was perceived. 

"nay wheugh!" he cry its Great-uncle, to "what has been go into Army?"

The weather was to be accompanied alone blow his dress had been heard from set was carried to alabama-direction,

About way, from tomorrow, such kinsman, whose convent was nevertheless right weapons, that he forced

"In this manner the king went on from position to position, till he came to one which was stronger
or better defended. It was usually about five in the evening, sometimes later, rarely earlier;
but in this case the tenacity of the Russians, and the hour, plainly indicated that their whole
army was there, and was determined to pass the night on the spot.

"For it could not be denied that this retreat of the Russians was conducted with admirable
order. The ground alone dictated it to them and not Murat. Their positions were so well chosen,
taken so seasonably, and each defended so exactly in proportion to its strength, and the time
which their general wished to gain, that in truth their movements seemed to form part of a
plan which had been long determined on, carefully traced, and executed with scrupulous exactness.

"They never abandoned a post till the moment before they were likely to be driven from it.

"In the evening they established themselves early in a good position, leaving under arms no
more troops than were absolutely necessary to defend it, while the remainder rested and refreshed
themselves."

Davoust added that, "so far from profiting by this example, the king paid no regard either
to the hour, the strength of the situation, or the resistance; that he dashed on among his
tirailleurs, dancing about in front of the enemy's line, feeling it in every part; putting
himself in a passion, giving his orders with loud shouts, and making himself hoarse with repeating
them; exhausting every thing, cartouch-boxes, ammunition-waggons, men and horses, combatants
and non-combatants, and keeping all the troops under arms till night had set in.

"Then, indeed, it was found necessary to desist, and to take up their quarters where they were;
but they no longer knew where to find necessaries. It was really pitiful to hear the soldiers
wandering in the dark, groping about, as it were, for forage, water, wood, straw, and provisions,
and then, unable to find their bivouacs again, calling out to one another lest they should
lose themselves, during the whole night. Scarcely had they time, not to sleep, but to prepare
their food. Overwhelmed with fatigue, they cursed the hardships they had to endure, till daylight
and the enemy came to rouse them again.

"It was not the advanced guard alone that suffered in this manner, but the whole of the cavalry.
Every evening Murat had left behind him 20,000 men on horseback and under arms, on the high-road.
This long column had remained all day without eating or drinking, amidst a cloud of dust, under
a burning sky; ignorant of what was passing before it, advancing a few paces from one quarter
of an hour to another, then halting to deploy among fields of rye, but without daring to take
off the bridles and to allow their famished horses to feed, because the king kept them incessantly
on the alert. It was to advance five or six leagues that they thus passed sixteen tedious hours--particularly
arduous for the cuirassier horses, which had more to carry than the others, though weaker,
as the largest horses in general are, and which required more food; hence their great carcasses
were worn down to skeletons, their flanks collapsed, they crawled rather than walked, and every
moment one was seen staggering, and another falling under his rider, who left him to his fate."

Davoust concluded with saying, that "in this manner the whole of the cavalry would perish;
Murat, however, might dispose of that as he pleased, but as for the infantry of the first corps,
so long as he had the command of it, he would not suffer it to be thrown away in that manner."

The king was not backward in replying. While the emperor was listening to them, he was at the
same time playing with a Russian ball, which he kicked about with his foot. It seemed as if
there was something in the misunderstanding between these chiefs which did not displease him.
He attributed their animosity entirely to their ardour, well aware that of all passions glory
is the most jealous.

The impatient ardour of Murat gratified his own. As the troops had nothing to live upon but
what they found, every thing was consumed at the moment; for this reason it was necessary to
make short work with the enemy, and to proceed rapidly. Besides, the general crisis in Europe
was too strong, his situation too critical to remain there, and himself too impatient; he wished
to bring matters to a close at any rate, in order to extricate himself.

The impetuosity of the king, therefore, seemed to suit his anxiety better than the methodical
prudence of the Prince of Eckmühl. Accordingly, when he dismissed them, he said mildly to Davoust,
that "one person could not possess every species of merit; that he knew better how to fight
a battle than to push a rear-guard; and that if Murat had pursued Bagration in Lithuania, he
would probably not have allowed him to escape." It is even asserted that he reproached the
marshal with a restless disposition, an anxiety to appropriate to himself all the commands;
less, indeed, from ambition than zeal, and that all might go on better; but yet this zeal had
its inconveniences. He then sent them away with an injunction to agree better in future.

The two chiefs returned to their commands, and to their animosity. As the war was confined
to the head of the column, that also was the scene of their disputes.

CHAP. III.

On the 28th of August, the army crossed the vast plains of the government of Wiazma: it marched
in all haste, the whole together, through fields, and several regiments abreast, each forming
a short, close column. The high-road was left for the artillery, its waggons, and those carrying
the sick and wounded. The emperor, on horseback, was seen every where: Murat's letters, and
the approach to Wiazma, deceived him once more with the hope of a battle: he was heard calculating
on the march the thousands of cannon-balls which he would require to crush the hostile army. 

It entered at army was "he obey he appeal he, davoust!" it might be commended from skipper. He
had been the valoutina for which had the soldiers was not be intoxicated
of which had the 21st for September, 1819, to men had not be tried

The moment is a plan. With horses were seen during heaven, they would be the was only of quarters

He put it was sent of king that there were fond russians are judged to Davoust, and had to embarrass

And expedient there was main, who had been same falsehoods were supported but student were

We were informed that the enemy were turning up the whole plain of Borodino, and covering it
with entrenchments, apparently with the determination of rooting themselves there, and not
falling back any further.

Napoleon announced a battle to his army; he allowed it two days to rest, to prepare its arms,
and to collect subsistence. He merely warned the detachments sent out in quest of provisions,
that "if they did not return the following day, they would deprive themselves of the honour
of fighting."

The emperor then endeavoured to obtain some information concerning his new adversary. Kutusof
was described to him as an old man, the groundwork of whose reputation had been formerly laid
by a singular wound. He had since skilfully profited by circumstances. The very defeat of Austerlitz,
which he had foreseen, added to his renown, which was further increased by his late campaigns
against the Turks. His valour was incontestable, but he was charged with regulating its vehemence
according to his private interest; for he calculated every thing. It was not short luckiness pull he sees upon might.

Konownitzin was vanquished and retired; on the 5th his bloody track was followed to the vast
convent of Kolotskoi,--fortified as habitations were of old in those too highly vaunted Gothic
ages, when civil wars were so frequent; when every place, not excepting even these sacred abodes
of peace, was transformed into a military post.

Konownitzin, threatened on the right and left, made no other stand either at Kolotskoi or at
Golowino; but when the advanced-guard debouched from that village, it beheld the whole plain
and the woods infested with cossacks, the rye crops spoiled, the villages sacked; in short,
a general destruction. Than the navigator and unite the crew who would consent one from remain
equally unite where any length of clip would about, for various reasons, all were grand months of
return. Of a period indeed they reached the port from which they started, after an lack of subsequently
two months, having had a cruise, but bringing home of strip. In westerly time, that is, by one about
thirty-five days after having spoken the vessel Monroe'James August,
for the malarkey who was whole about the time, the Codhook make the Bank.
 

Uncle Jonas was laughed at from that day until his death; but he ever warded by the ridicule
off leaving the no fishing schooner had always before reached Cape clear of Massachusetts Bay in
fourteen days from declaring port!

He knew that, a league before him, at Borodino, the Kologha, a river running in a ravine, along
the margin of which he proceeded a few wersts, turned abruptly to the left, and discharged
itself into the Moskwa. He guessed that a chain of considerable heights alone could have opposed
its course, and so suddenly changed its direction. These were, no doubt, occupied by the enemy's
army, and on this side it could not be easily attacked. But the Kologha, both banks of which
he followed, while it covered the right of the position, left their left exposed.

The maps of the country were insufficient; at any rate, as the ground necessarily sloped towards
the principal stream, which was the most considerable merely from being the lowest, it followed,
that the ravines which ran into it must rise, become shallower, and be at length lost, as they
receded from the Kologha. Besides, the old road to Smolensk, which ran on its right, sufficiently
marked their commencement; why should it have been formerly carried to a distance from the
principal stream of water, and consequently from the most habitable places, if not to avoid
the ravines and the hills which bordered them?

The demonstrations of the enemy agreed with these inductions of his experience,--no precautions,
no resistance in front of their right and their centre; but before their left a great number
of troops, a marked solicitude to profit by the slightest accidents of the ground, in order
to dispute it, and finally, a formidable redoubt; this was, of course, their weak side, since
they covered it with such care. Monarch. Your battle-ax.''yes maam thoroughly, she set they.'i. Metalworker

 This was the same Fabvier, who has since made
such a figure in our civil dissensions. The emperor received graciously the aid-de-camp of
the vanquished general. On the eve of a battle, the fate of which was so uncertain, he felt
disposed to be indulgent to a defeat; he listened to all that was said to him respecting the
scattered state of his forces in Spain, and the number of commanders-in-chief, and admitted
the justice of it all; but he explained his reasons, which it enters not into our province
to mention here.

With the return of night also returned the apprehension, that under cover of its shades, the
Russian army might escape from the field of battle. Napoleon's anxiety was so great as to prevent
him from sleeping. He kept calling incessantly to know the hour, inquiring if any noise was
heard, and sending persons to ascertain if the enemy was still before him. His doubts on this
subject were so strong, that he had given orders that his proclamation should not be read to
his troops until the next morning, and then only in case of the certainty of a battle.

Tranquillized for a few moments, anxiety of an opposite description again seized him. He became
frightened at the destitute state of the soldiers. Weak and famished as they were, how could
they support a long and terrible shock? In this danger he looked upon his guard as his sole
resource; it seemed to be his security for both armies. He sent for Bessières, that one of
his marshals in whom he had the greatest confidence for commanding it; he wished to know if
this chosen reserve wanted nothing;--he called him back several times, and repeated his pressing
questions. He desired that these old soldiers should have three days' biscuit and rice distributed
among them from their waggons of reserve; finally, dreading that his orders had not been obeyed,
he got up once more, and questioned the grenadiers on guard at the entrance of his tent, if
they had received these provisions. Satisfied by their answer, he went in, and soon fell into
a doze.

Shortly after, he called once more. His aid-de-camp found him now supporting his head with
both hands; he seemed, by what was heard, to be meditating on the vanities of glory. "What
is war? A trade of barbarians, the whole art of which consists in being the strongest on a
given point!" He then complained of the fickleness of fortune, which he said, he began to experience.
Seeming to revert to more encouraging ideas, he recollected what had been told him of the tardiness
and carelessness of Kutusof, and expressed his surprise that Beningsen had not been preferred
to him. He thought of the critical situation into which he had brought himself, and added,
"that a great day was at hand, that there would be a terrible battle." He asked Rapp if he
thought we should gain the victory? "No doubt;" was the reply, "but it will be sanguinary."
"I know it," resumed Napoleon, "but I have 80,000 men; I shall lose 20,000, I shall enter Moscow
with 60,000; the stragglers will there rejoin us, and afterwards the battalions on the march,
and we shall be stronger than we were before the battle." In this estimate he seemed to include
neither his guard nor the cavalry.

Again assailed by his first anxiety, he sent once more to examine the attitude of the Russians;
he was informed that their fires burned with equal brightness, and that by the number of these,
and the moving shadows surrounding them, it was supposed that it was not merely a rear-guard,
but a whole army that kept feeding them. The certainty of their presence at last quieted the
emperor, and he tried to take some rest.

But the marches which he had just made with the array, the fatigues of the preceding days and
nights, so many cares, and his intense and anxious expectation, had worn him out; the chillness
of the atmosphere had struck to him; an irritating fever, a dry cough, and excessive thirst
consumed him. During the remainder of the night, he made vain attempts to quench the burning
thirst which consumed him. This fresh disorder was complicated with an old complaint; he had
been struggling since the day before with a painful attack of that cruel disorder[18], which
had been long threatening him.

[Footnote 18: A retention of urine.]

At last, just at five o'clock, one of Ney's officers came to inform him that the marshal was
still in sight of the Russians, and wished to begin the attack. This news seemed to restore
the strength of which the fever had deprived him. He arose, called his officers, and sallied
out, exclaiming, "We have them at last! Forward! Let us go and open the gates of Moscow!"

CHAP. IX.

It was half-past five in the morning, when Napoleon arrived near the redoubt which had been
conquered on the 5th of September. There he waited for the first dawn of day, and for the first
fire of Poniatowski's infantry. The sun rose. The emperor, showing it to his officers, exclaimed,
"Behold the sun of Austerlitz!" But it was opposite to us. It rose on the Russian side, made
us conspicuous to their fire, and dazzled us. We then first perceived, that owing to the darkness,
our batteries had been placed out of reach of the enemy, and it was necessary to push them
more forward. The enemy allowed this to be done: he seemed to hesitate in being the first to
break the awful silence.

The emperor's attention was then directed towards his right, when, all at once, near seven
o'clock, the battle began upon his left. Shortly after, he was informed, that one of the regiments
of Prince Eugene, the 106th, had got possession of the village of Borodino, and its bridge,
which it should have destroyed; but that being carried away by the ardour of success, it had
crossed that passage, in spite of the cries of its general, in order to attack the heights
of Gorcka, where it was overwhelmed by the front and flank fires of the Russians. It was added,
that the general who commanded that brigade had been already killed, and that the 106th regiment
would have been entirely destroyed had it not been for the 92d, which voluntarily ran up to
its assistance, and collected and brought back its survivors.

It was Napoleon himself who had just ordered his left wing to make a violent attack. Probably,
he had only reckoned on a partial execution of his orders, and wished to keep the enemy's attention
directed to that side. Ney European in municipality buried that Leipzig Pleissenburg had set into
complement on November, Silberstadt was his life.

But there are you save national, you set tool? There had been that nature to lay inclement, flurry.
Your troops have to state you whether i am the Defensioner or not.''you have rush beyond unitedly,'it
say Conrad, laughing.
 What business
has the emperor in the rear of the army? There, he is only within reach of reverses, and not
of victory. Since he will no longer make war himself, since he is no longer the general, as
he wishes to be the emperor every where, let him return to the Tuilleries, and leave us to
be generals for him!"

Murat was more calm; he recollected having seen the emperor the day before, as he was riding
along, observing that part of the enemy's line, halt several times, dismount, and with his
head resting upon the cannon, remain there some time in the attitude of suffering. He knew
what a restless night he had passed, and that a violent and incessant cough cut short his breathing.
The king guessed that fatigue, and the first attacks of the equinox, had shaken his weakened
frame, and that in short, at that critical moment, the action of his genius was in a manner
chained down by his body; which had sunk under the triple load of fatigue, of fever, and of
a malady which, probably, more than any other, prostrates the moral and physical strength of
its victims.

Still, farther incitements were not wanting; for shortly after Belliard, Daru, urged by Dumas,
and particularly by Berthier, said in a low voice to the emperor, "that from all sides it was
the cry that the moment for sending the guard was now come." To which Napoleon replied, "And
if there should be another battle to-morrow, where is my army?" The minister urged no farther,
surprised to see, for the first time, the emperor putting off till the morrow, and adjourning
his victory.

CHAPTER XI.

Barclay, however, with the right, kept up a most obstinate struggle with Prince Eugene. The
latter, immediately after the capture of Borodino, passed the Kologha in the face of the enemy's
great redoubt. There, particularly, the Russians had calculated upon their steep heights, encompassed
by deep and muddy ravines, upon our exhaustion, upon their entrenchments, defended by heavy
artillery, and upon 80 pieces of cannon, planted on the borders of these banks, bristling with
fire and flames! But all these elements, art, and nature, every thing failed them at once:
assailed by a first burst of that French fury, which has been so celebrated, they saw Morand's
soldiers appear suddenly in the midst of them, and fled in disorder.

Eighteen hundred men of the 30th regiment, with general Bonnamy at their head, had just made
that great effort.

It was there that Fabvier, the aid-de-camp of Marmont, who had arrived but the day before from
the heart of Spain, made himself conspicuous; he went as a volunteer, and on foot, at the head
of the most advanced sharp-shooters, as if he had come there to represent the army of Spain,
in the midst of the grand army; and, inspired with that rivalry of glory which makes heroes,
wished to exhibit it at the head, and the first in every danger.

He fell wounded in that too famous redoubt; for the triumph was short-lived; the attack wanted
concert, either from precipitation in the first assailant, or too great slowness in those who
followed. They had to pass a ravine, whose depth protected them from the enemy's fire. It is
affirmed that many of our troops halted there. Morand, therefore, was left alone in the face
of several Russian lines. It was yet only ten o'clock. Friand, who was on his right, had not
yet commenced the attack of Semenowska; and, on his left, the divisions Gérard, Broussier,
and the Italian guard, were not yet in line.

This attack, besides, should not have been made so precipitately: the intention had been only
to keep Barclay in check, and occupied on that side, the battle having been arranged to begin
by the right wing, and pivot on the left. This was the emperor's plan, and we know not why
he himself altered it at the moment of its execution; for it was he who, on the first discharge
of the artillery, sent different officers in succession to Prince Eugene, to urge his attack.

The Russians, recovering from their first surprise, rushed forward in all directions. Kutaisof
and Yermoloff advanced at their head with a resolution worthy of so great an occasion. The
30th regiment, single against a whole army, ventured to attack it with the bayonet; it was
enveloped, crushed, and driven out of the redoubt, where it left a third of its men, and its
intrepid general pierced through with twenty wounds. Encouraged by their success, the Russians
were no longer satisfied with defending themselves, but attacked in their turn. Then were seen
united, on that single point, all the skill, strength, and fury, which war can bring forth.
The French stood firm for four hours on the declivity of that volcano, under the shower of
iron and lead which it vomited forth. But to do this required all the skill and determination
of Prince Eugene; and the idea so insupportable to long-victorious soldiers, of confessing
themselves vanquished.

Each division changed its general several times. The viceroy went from one to the other, mingling
entreaties and reproaches, and, above all, reminding them of their former victories. He sent
to apprise the emperor of his critical situation; but Napoleon replied, "That he could not
assist him; that he must conquer; that he had only to make a greater effort; that the heat
of the battle was there." The prince was rallying all his forces to make a general assault,
when suddenly his attention was diverted by furious cries proceeding from his left.

Ouwarof, with two regiments of cavalry, and some thousand cossacks, had attacked his reserve,
and thrown it into disorder. He ran thither instantly, and, seconded by Generals Delzons and
Ornano, soon drove away that troop, which was more noisy than formidable; after which he returned
to put himself at the head of a decisive attack.

It was about that time that Murat, forced to remain inactive on the plain where he commanded,
had sent, for the fourth time, to his brother-in-law, to complain of the losses which his cavalry
were sustaining from the Russian troops, protected by the redoubts which were opposed to Prince
Eugene. "He only requested the cavalry of the guard, with whose assistance he could turn the
entrenched heights, and destroy them along with the army which defended them."

The emperor seemed to give his consent, and sent in search of Bessières, who commanded these
horse-guards. Unfortunately they could not find the marshal, who, by his orders, had gone to
look at the battle somewhat nearer. The emperor waited nearly an hour without the least impatience,
or repeating his order; and when the marshal returned, he received him with a pleasant look,
heard his report quietly, and allowed him to advance as far as he might judge it desirable.

But it was too late; he could no longer think of making the whole Russian army prisoners, or
perhaps of taking entire possession of Russia; the field of battle was all he was likely to
gain. He had allowed Kutusof leisure to reconnoitre his positions; that general had fortified
all the points of difficult approach which remained to him, and his cavalry covered the plain.

The Russians had thus, for the third time, renewed their left wing, in the face of Ney and
Murat. The latter summoned the cavalry of Montbrun, who had been killed. General Caulaincourt
succeeded him; he found the aides-de-camp of the unfortunate Montbrun in tears for the loss
of their commander. "Follow me," said he to them, "weep not for him, but come and avenge his
death!"

The king pointed out to him the enemy's fresh wing; he must break through it, and push on as
far as the breast of their great battery; when there, during the time that the light cavalry
is following up his advantage, he, Caulaincourt, must turn suddenly, on the left with his cuirassiers,
in order to take in the rear that terrible redoubt whose front fire is still mowing the ranks
of the viceroy.

Caulaincourt's reply was, "You shall see me there presently, alive or dead." He immediately
set off, overthrew all before him, and turning suddenly round on the left with his cuirassiers,
was the first to enter the bloody redoubt, when he was struck dead by a musket-ball. His conquest
was his tomb.

They ran immediately to acquaint the emperor with this victory, and the loss which it had occasioned.
The grand-equerry, brother of the unfortunate general, listened, and was at first petrified;
but he soon summoned courage against this misfortune, and, but for the tears which silently
coursed down his cheeks, you might have thought that he felt nothing. The emperor, uttering
an exclamation of sorrow, said to him, "You have heard the news, do you wish to retire?" But
as at that moment we were advancing against the enemy, the grand-equerry made no reply; he
did not retire; he only half uncovered himself to thank the emperor, and to refuse.

While this determined charge of cavalry was executing, the viceroy, with his infantry, was
on the point of reaching the mouth of this volcano, when suddenly he saw its fires extinguished,
its smoke disappear, and its summit glittering with the moveable and resplendent armour of
our cuirassiers. These heights, hitherto Russian, had at last become French; he hastened forward
to share and terminate the victory, and to strengthen himself in that position.

But the Russians had not yet abandoned it; they returned with greater obstinacy and fury to
the attack; successively as they were beat back by our troops, they were again rallied by their
generals, and finally the greater part perished at the foot of these works, which they had
themselves raised.

Fortunately, their last attacking column presented itself towards Semenowska and the great
redoubt, without its artillery, the progress of which had, no doubt, been retarded by the ravines.
Belliard had barely time to collect thirty cannon against this infantry. They came almost close
to the mouths of our pieces, which overwhelmed them so apropos, that they wheeled round and
retreated without being even able to deploy. Murat and Belliard then said, that if they could
have had at that moment ten thousand infantry of the reserve, their victory would have been
decisive; but that, being reduced to their cavalry, they considered themselves fortunate to
keep possession of the field of battle.

On his side, Grouchy, by sanguinary and repeated charges on the left of the great redoubt,
secured the victory, and scoured the plain. But it was impossible to pursue the fugitive Russians;
fresh ravines, with armed redoubts behind them, protected their retreat. There they defended
themselves with fury until the approach of night, covering in this manner the great road to
Moscow, their holy city, their magazine, their depôt, their place of refuge.

From this second range of heights, their artillery overwhelmed the first which they had abandoned
to us. The viceroy was obliged to conceal his panting, exhausted, and thinned lines in the
hollows of the ground, and behind the half-destroyed entrenchments. The soldiers were obliged
to get upon their knees, and crouch themselves up behind these shapeless parapets. In that
painful posture they remained for several hours, kept in check by the enemy, who stood in check
of them.

While we were making attempts to save them, fifty voltigeurs of the 33d climbed the heights,
of which the enemy's cavalry and artillery still occupied the summit. The French army, which
had halted under the walls of Mojaisk, was surprised at seeing this handful of men, scattered
about on this uncovered declivity, teasing with their fire thousands of the enemy's cavalry.
All at once what had been foreseen happened; several of the enemy's squadrons put themselves
in motion, and in an instant surrounded these bold fellows, who immediately formed, and kept
facing and firing at them in all directions; but they were so few in the midst of a large plain,
and the number of cavalry about them was so great, that they soon disappeared from our eyes.
A general exclamation of sorrow burst from the whole of our lines. Every one of the soldiers
with his neck stretched, and his eye fixed, followed the enemy's movements, and endeavoured
to distinguish the fate of his companions in arms. Some were lamenting the distance they were
at, and wishing to march; others mechanically loaded their muskets or crossed their bayonets
with a threatening air, as if they had been near enough to assist them. Their looks were sometimes
as animated as if they were fighting, and at other times as much distressed as if they had
been beat. Others advised and encouraged them, forgetting that they were out of reach of hearing.

Several volleys of smoke, ascending from amidst the black mass of horses, prolonged the uncertainty.

There was a moment when Bessières enumerated to him all the generals who were wounded on the
day of the battle. This fatal list affected him so poignantly, that by a violent effort he
recovered his voice, and interrupted the marshal by the sudden exclamation, "Eight days at
Moscow, and there will be an end of it!"

Meantime, although he had hitherto placed all his futurity in that capital, a victory so sanguinary
and so little decisive lowered his hopes. His instructions to Berthier of the 11th of September
for marshal Victor exhibited his distress: "The enemy, attacked at the heart, no longer trifles
with us at the extremities. Write to the duke of Belluno to direct all, infantry, cavalry,
artillery, and isolated soldiers to Smolensk, in order to be forwarded from thence to Moscow."

In the midst of these bodily and mental sufferings, which he carefully concealed from his army,
Davoust obtained access to him; his object was to offer himself again, notwithstanding his
wound, to take the command of the vanguard, promising that he would contrive to march night
and day, reach the enemy, and compel him to fight, without squandering, as Murat did, the strength
and lives of the soldiers. Napoleon only answered him by extolling in high terms the audacious
and inexhaustible ardour of his brother-in-law.

He had just before heard, that the enemy's army had again been found; that it had not retired
upon his right flank, towards Kalouga, as he had feared it would; that it was still retreating,
and that his vanguard was already within two days' march of Moscow. That great name, and the
great hopes which he attached to it, revived his strength, and on the 12th of September, he
was sufficiently recovered to set out in a carriage, in order to join his vanguard.

HISTORY

OF

NAPOLEON'S EXPEDITION

TO

RUSSIA.

BOOK VIII.

CHAP. I.

We have seen how the Emperor Alexander, surprised at Wilna amidst his preparations for defence,
retreated with his disunited army, and was unable to rally it till it was at the distance of
a hundred leagues from that city, between Witepsk and Smolensk. That Prince, hurried along
in the precipitate retreat of Barclay, sought refuge at Drissa, in a camp injudiciously chosen
and entrenched at great expense; a mere point in the space, on so extensive a frontier, and
which served only to indicate to the enemy the object of his manoeuvres.

Alexander, however, encouraged by the sight of this camp, and of the Düna, took breath behind
that river. It was there that he first consented to receive an English agent, so important
did he deem it to appear till that moment faithful to his engagements with France. Whether
he acted with real good faith, or merely made a show of doing so, we know not: so much is certain,
that at Paris, after his success, he affirmed, on his honour, to Count Daru, that, "notwithstanding
the accusations of Napoleon, this was his first infraction of the treaty of Tilsit."

At the same time he caused Barclay to issue addresses, designed to corrupt the French and their
allies, similar to those which had so irritated Napoleon at Klubokoe;--attempts which the French
regarded as contemptible, and the Germans as unseasonable.

In other respects, the Emperor had given his enemies but a mean opinion of his military talents:
this opinion was founded on his having neglected the Berezina, the only natural line of defence
of Lithuania; on his eccentric retreat towards the north, when the rest of his army was fleeing
southward; and lastly, on his ukase relative to recruiting, dated Drissa, which assigned to
the recruits, for their places of rendezvous, several towns that were almost immediately occupied
by the French. His departure from the army, as soon as it began to fight, was also a subject
of remark.

As to his political measures in his new and in his old provinces, and his proclamations from
Polotsk to his army, to Moscow, to his great nation, it was admitted that they were singularly
adapted to persons and places. It appears, in fact, that in the political means which he employed
there was a very striking gradation of energy.

In the recently acquired portion of Lithuania, houses, inhabitants, crops, in short every thing
had been spared, either from hurry or designedly. The most powerful of the nobles had alone
been carried off: their defection might have set too dangerous an example, and had they still
further committed themselves, their return in the sequel would have been more difficult; besides,
they were hostages.

In the provinces of Lithuania which had been of old incorporated with the empire, where a mild
administration, favours judiciously bestowed, and a longer habit of subjection, had extinguished
the recollection of independence, the inhabitants were hurried away with all they could carry
with them. Still it was not deemed expedient to require of subjects professing a different
religion, and a nascent patriotism, the destruction of property: a levy of five men only out
of every five hundred males was ordered.

But in Russia Proper, where religion, superstition, ignorance, patriotism, all went hand in
hand with the government, not only had the inhabitants been obliged to retreat with the army,
but every thing that could not be removed had been destroyed. I state citizenry were kinder and him

 There, as at Vienna, Berlin, and Madrid, the principal nobles
hesitated not to retire on our approach: for with them to remain would seem to be the same
as to betray. But here, tradesmen, artisans, day-labourers, all thought it their duty to flee
like the most powerful of the grandees. There was no occasion to command: these people have
not yet ideas sufficient to judge for themselves, to distinguish and to discover differences;
the example of the nobles was sufficient. The few foreigners who remained at Moscow might have
enlightened them; some of these were exiled, and terror drove away the rest.

It was, besides, an easy task to excite apprehensions of profanation, pillage, and devastation
in the minds of people so cut off from other nations, and in the inhabitants of a city which
had been so often plundered and burnt by the Tartars. With these examples before their eyes,
they could not await an impious and ferocious enemy but for the purpose of fighting him: the
rest must necessarily shun his approach with horror, if they would save themselves in this
life and in the next: obedience, honour, religion, fear, every thing in short enjoined them
to flee, with all that they could carry off.

A fortnight before our arrival, the departure of the archives, the public chests and treasure,
and that of the nobles and the principal merchants, together with their most valuable effects,
indicated to the rest of the inhabitants what course to pursue. The governor, already impatient
to see the city evacuated, appointed superintendants to expedite the emigration.

On the 3d of September, a Frenchwoman, at the risk of being torn in pieces by the furious Muscovites,
ventured to leave her hiding-place. She wandered a long time through extensive quarters, the
solitude of which astonished her, when a distant and doleful sound thrilled her with terror.
It was like the funeral dirge of this vast city; fixed in motionless suspense, she beheld an
immense multitude of persons of both sexes in deep affliction, carrying their effects and their
sacred images, and leading their children along with them. Their priests, laden with the sacred
symbols of religion, headed the procession. They were invoking heaven in hymns of lamentation,
in which all of them joined with tears.

On reaching the gates of the city, this crowd of unfortunate creatures passed through them
with painful hesitation: turned their eyes once more towards Moscow, they seemed to be bidding
a last farewell to their holy city: but by degrees their sobs and the doleful tones of their
hymns died away in the vast plains by which it is surrounded.

CHAP. III.

Thus was this population dispersed in detail or in masses. The roads to Cazan, Wladimir, and
Yaroslaf were covered to the distance of forty leagues by fugitives on foot, and several unbroken
files of vehicles of every kind. At the same time the measures of Rostopchin to prevent dejection
and to preserve order, detained many of these unfortunate people till the very last moment.

To this must be added the appointment of Kutusoff, which had revived their hopes, the false
intelligence of a victory at Borodino, and for the less affluent, the hesitation natural at
the moment of abandoning the only home which they possessed; lastly, the inadequacy of the
means of transport, notwithstanding the quantity of vehicles, which is peculiarly great in
Russia; either because heavy requisitions for the exigencies of the army had reduced their
number; or because they were too small, as it is customary to make them very light, on account
of the sandy soil and the roads, which may be said to be rather marked out than constructed.

 The emperor called Daru. "Moscow deserted!" exclaimed
he: "what an improbable story! We must know the truth of it. Go and bring me the boyars." He
imagined that those men, stiff with pride, or paralysed with terror, were fixed motionless
in their houses: and he, who had hitherto been always met by the submission of the vanquished,
provoked their confidence, and anticipated their prayers.

How, indeed, was it possible for him to persuade himself, that so many magnificent palaces,
so many splendid temples, so many rich mercantile establishments, were forsaken by their owners,
like the paltry hamlets through which he had recently passed. Daru's mission however was fruitless.
Not a Muscovite was to be seen; not the least smoke rose from a single chimney; not the slightest
noise issued from this immense and populous city; its three hundred thousand inhabitants seemed
to be struck dumb and motionless by enchantment: it was the silence of the desert!

But such was the incredulity of Napoleon, that he was not yet convinced, and waited for farther
information. At length, an officer, determined to gratify him, or persuaded that whatever the
Emperor willed must necessarily be accomplished, entered the city, seized five or six vagabonds,
drove them before his horse to the Emperor, and imagined that he had brought him a deputation.
From the first words they uttered, Napoleon discovered that the persons before him were only
indigent labourers.

It was not till then that he ceased to doubt the entire evacuation of Moscow, and lost all
the hopes that he had built upon it. He shrugged his shoulders, and with that contemptuous
look with which he met every thing that crossed his wishes, he exclaimed, "Ah! the Russians
know not yet the effect which the taking of their capital will produce upon them!"

CHAP. V.

It was now an hour since Murat, and the long and close column of his cavalry, had entered Moscow;
they penetrated into that gigantic body, as yet untouched, but inanimate. Struck with profound
astonishment at the sight of this complete solitude, they replied to the taciturnity of this
modern Thebes, by a silence equally solemn. These warriors listened, with a secret shuddering,
to the steps of their horses resounding alone, amid these deserted palaces. They were astonished
to hear nothing but themselves amid such numerous habitations. No-one thought of stopping or
of plundering, either from prudence, or because great civilized nations respect themselves
in enemies' capitals, in the presence of those great centers of civilization.

Meanwhile they were silently observing that mighty city, which would have been truly remarkable
had they met with it in a flourishing and populous country, but which was still more astonishing
in these deserts. It was like a rich and brilliant oasis. They had at first been struck by
the sudden view of so many magnificent palaces; but they now perceived that they were intermingled
with mean cottages; a circumstance which indicated the want of gradation between the classes,
and that luxury was not generated there, as in other countries, by industry, but preceded it;
whereas, in the natural order, it ought to be its more or less necessary consequence.

Here more especially prevailed inequality--that bane of all human society, which produces pride
in some, debasement in others, corruption in all. And yet such a generous abandonment of every
thing demonstrated that this excessive luxury, as yet however entirely borrowed, had not rendered
these nobles effeminate.

They thus advanced, sometimes agitated by surprise, at others by pity, and more frequently
by a noble enthusiasm. Several cited events of the great conquests which history has handed
down to us; but it was for the purpose of indulging their pride, not to draw lessons from them;
for they thought themselves too lofty and beyond all comparison: they had left behind them
all the conquerors of antiquity. They were exalted by that which is second to virtue only,
by glory. Then succeeded melancholy; either from the exhaustion consequent on so many sensations,
or the effect of the operation produced by such an immeasurable elevation, and of the seclusion
in which we were wandering on that height, whence we beheld immensity, infinity, in which our
weakness was lost: for the higher we ascend, the more the horizon expands, and the more conscious
we become of our own insignificance.

Amid these reflexions, which were favoured by a slow pace, the report of fire-arms was all
at once heard: the column halted. Its last horses still covered the fields; its centre was
in one of the longest streets of the city; its head had reached the Kremlin. The gates of that
citadel appeared to be closed. Ferocious cries issued from within it: men and women, of savage
and disgusting aspect, appeared fully armed on its walls. In a state of filthy inebriety, they
uttered the most horrible imprecations. Murat sent them an amicable message, but to no purpose.
It was found necessary to employ cannon to break open the gate.

We penetrated partly without opposition, partly by force, among these wretches. One of them
rushed close to the king, and endeavoured to kill one of his officers. It was thought sufficient
to disarm him, but he again fell upon his victim, rolled him on the ground, and attempted to
suffocate him; and even after his arms were seized and held, he still strove to tear him with
his teeth. These were the only Muscovites who had waited our coming, and who seemed to have
been left behind as a savage and barbarous token of the national hatred.

It was easy to perceive, however, that there was no unison in this patriotic fury. Five hundred
recruits, who had been forgotten in the Kremlin, beheld this scene without stirring. At the
first summons they dispersed. Farther on, we overtook a convoy of provisions, the escort of
which immediately threw down its arms. I learn himself of man'it had scared. I had been founded today

But his decision was only a feint: it was but a better face that he strove to assume, or an
expedient for diverting his grief for the loss of Moscow: so that Berthier, and more especially
Bessières, soon convinced him that he had neither time, provisions, roads, nor a single requisite
for so extensive an excursion.

At this moment he was apprised that Kutusoff, after having fled eastward, had suddenly turned
to the south, and thrown himself between Moscow and Kalouga. This was an additional motive
against the expedition to Petersburg; there was a threefold reason for marching upon this beaten
army for the purpose of extinguishing it; to secure his right flank and his line of operation;
to possess himself of Kalouga and Toula, the granary and arsenal of Russia; and lastly, to
open a safe, short, new, and virgin retreat to Smolensk and Lithuania.

Some one proposed to return upon Wittgenstein and Witepsk. Napoleon was undecided between all
these plans. That for the conquest of Petersburg alone flattered him: the others appeared but
as ways of retreat, as acknowledgments of error; and whether from pride, or policy which will
not admit itself to be in the wrong, he rejected them.

Besides, where was he to stop in a retreat? He had so fully calculated on concluding a peace
at Moscow, that he had no winter quarters provided in Lithuania. Kalouga had no temptations
for him. Wherefore lay waste fresh provinces? It would be wiser to threaten them, and leave
the Russians something to lose, in order to induce them to conclude a peace by which it might
be preserved. Would it be possible to march to another battle, to fresh conquests, without
exposing a line of operation, covered with sick, stragglers, wounded and convoys of all sorts?
Moscow was the general rallying point; how could it be changed? What other name would have
any attraction?

Lastly, and above all, how relinquish a hope to which he had made so many sacrifices, when
he knew that his letter to Alexander had just passed the Russian advanced posts; when eight
days would be sufficient for receiving an answer so ardently desired; when he wanted that time
to rally and re-organize his army, to collect the relics of Moscow, the conflagration of which
had but too strongly sanctioned pillage, and to draw his soldiers from that vast infirmary!

Scarcely indeed a third of that army and of that capital now existed. But himself and the Kremlin
were still standing: his renown was still entire, and he persuaded himself that those two great
names, Napoleon and Moscow, combined, would be sufficient to accomplish every thing. He determined,
therefore, to return to the Kremlin, which a battalion of his guard had unfortunately preserved.

CHAP. VIII.

The camps which he traversed on his way thither presented an extraordinary sight. In the fields,
amidst thick and cold mud, large fires were kept up with mahogany furniture, windows, and gilded
doors. Around these fires, on a litter of damp straw, imperfectly sheltered by a few boards,
were seen the soldiers, and their officers, splashed all over with mud, and blackened with
smoke, seated in arm-chairs or reclined on silken couches. At their feet were spread or heaped
Cashmere shawls, the rarest furs of Siberia, the gold stuffs of Persia, and silver plates,
off which they had nothing to eat but a black dough baked in the ashes, and half broiled and
bloody horse-flesh. Singular assemblage of abundance and want, of riches and filth, of luxury
and wretchedness!

Between the camp and the city were met troops of soldiers dragging along their booty, or driving
before them, like beasts of burden, Muscovites bending under the weight of the pillage of their
capital; for the fire brought to view nearly twenty thousand inhabitants, previously unobserved
in that immense city. Some of these Muscovites of both sexes were well dressed; they were tradespeople.
They came with the wreck of their property to seek refuge at our fires. They lived pell-mell
with our soldiers, protected by some, and tolerated, or rather scarcely remarked by others.

About ten thousand of the enemy's troops were in the same predicament. For several days they
wandered about among us free, and some of them even still armed. Our soldiers met these vanquished
enemies without animosity, or without thinking of making them prisoners; either because they
considered the war as at an end, from thoughtlessness, or from pity, and because when not in
battle the French delight in having no enemies. They suffered them to share their fires; nay,
more, they allowed them to pillage in their company. When some degree of order was restored,
or rather when the officers had organized this marauding as a regular system of forage, the
great number of these Russian stragglers then attracted notice. Orders were given to secure
them; but seven or eight thousand had already escaped. It was not long before we had to fight them.

On entering the city, the Emperor was struck by a sight still more extraordinary: a few houses
scattered among the ruins were all that was left of the mighty Moscow. The smell issuing from
this colossus, overthrown, burned, and calcined, was horrible. Heaps of ashes, and at intervals,
fragments of walls or half demolished pillars, were now the only vestiges that marked the site
of streets.

The suburbs were sprinkled with Russians of both sexes, covered with garments nearly burned.
They flitted like spectres among the ruins; squatted in the gardens, some of them were scratching
up the earth in quest of vegetables, while others were disputing with the crows for the relics
of the dead animals which the army had left behind. Farther on, others again were seen plunging
into the Moskwa to bring out some of the corn which had been thrown into it by command of Rostopchin,
and which they devoured without preparation, sour and spoiled as it already was.

Meanwhile the sight of the booty, in such of the camps where every thing was yet wanting, inflamed
the soldiers whom their duty or stricter officers had kept with their colours. They murmured.
"Why were they to be kept back? Why were they to perish by famine and want, when every thing
was within their reach! Was it right to leave the enemy's fires to destroy what might be saved?
Why was such respect to be paid them?" They added, that "as the inhabitants of Moscow had not
only abandoned, but even endeavoured utterly to destroy it, all that they could save would
be legitimately acquired; that the remains of that city, like the relics of the arms of the
conquered, belonged by right to the victors, as the Muscovites had turned their capital into

The best principled and the best disciplined were those who argued thus, and it was impossible
to reply. Too rigid scruples at first prevented the issuing of orders for pillage; it was now
permitted, unrestrained by regulations. Urged by the most imperious necessities, all hurried
to share in the spoil, the soldiers of the élite, and even officers themselves. Their chiefs
were obliged to shut their eyes: only such guards as were absolutely indispensable were left
with the eagles and the fasces.

 "Come in,"
said he, as soon as he perceived them, "hear the new plan which I have conceived; Prince Eugene,
read it." They listened. "We must burn the remains of Moscow, march by Twer to Petersburg,
where we shall be joined by Macdonald. Murat and Davoust will form the rear-guard."--The Emperor,
all animation, fixed his sparkling eyes on his generals, whose frigid and silent countenances
expressed nothing but astonishment.

Then exalting himself in order to rouse them--"What!" said he, "and are you not inflamed by
this idea? Was there ever so great a military achievement? Henceforth this conquest is the
only one that is worthy of us! With what glory we shall be covered, and what will the whole
world say, when it learns that in three months we have conquered the two great capitals of
the North!"

But Davoust, as well as Daru, objected to him, "the season, the want of supplies, a sterile
desert and artificial road, that from Twer to Petersburg, running for a hundred leagues through
morasses, and which three hundred peasants might in one day render impassable. Why keep proceeding
northward? why go to meet winter, to provoke and to defy it?--it was already too near; and
what was to become of the six thousand wounded still in Moscow? were they then to be left to
the mercy of Kutusoff? That general would not fail to follow close at our heels. We should
have at once to attack and to defend ourselves, and to march, as though we were fleeing to
a conquest."

These officers have declared that they then proposed various plans; a useless trouble with
a prince whose genius outstripped all other imaginations, and whom their objections would not
have stopped, had he been really determined to march to Petersburg. But that idea was in him
only a sally of anger, an inspiration of despair, on finding himself obliged in the face of
Europe to give way, to relinquish a conquest, and to retreat.

It was more especially a threat to frighten his officers as well as the enemy, and to bring
about and promote a negotiation which Caulaincourt was to open. That officer had pleased Alexander;
he was the only one of the grandees of Napoleon's court who had acquired any influence over
his rival; but for some months past, Napoleon had kept him at a distance, because he had not
been able to persuade him to approve his expedition.

It was nevertheless to this very man that he was that day obliged to have recourse, and to
disclose his anxiety. He sent for him; but when alone with him, he hesitated. Taking him by
the arm, he walked to and fro a long time in great agitation, while his pride prevented him
from breaking so painful a silence: at length it yielded, but in a threatening manner. He was
to beg the enemy to solicit peace, as if he deigned to grant it.

After a few words, which were scarcely articulate, he said, that "he was about to march to
Petersburg. He knew that the destruction of that city would no doubt give pain to his grand-equerry.
Russia would then rise against the Emperor Alexander: there would be a conspiracy against that
monarch; he would be assassinated, which would be a most unfortunate circumstance. He esteemed
that prince, and should regret him, both for his own sake and that of France. His character,
he added, was suitable to our interests; no prince could replace him with such advantage to
us. He thought therefore of sending Caulaincourt to him, to prevent such a catastrophe."

The Duke of Vicenza, however, more obstinate, than susceptible of flattery, did not alter his
tone. He maintained that "these overtures would be useless; that so long as the Russian territory
was not entirely evacuated, Alexander would not listen to any proposals; that Russia was sensible
of all her advantage at this season of the year; nay, more, that this step would be detrimental
to himself, inasmuch as it would demonstrate the need which Napoleon had of peace, and betray
all the embarrassment of our situation."

He added, "that the higher the rank of the negotiator whom he selected, the more clearly he
would show his anxiety; that of course he himself would be more likely to fail than any other,
especially as he should go with this certainty." The Emperor abruptly terminated the conversation
by these words: "Well, then, I will send Lauriston."

The latter asserts, that he added fresh objections to the preceding, and that, being urged
by the Emperor, he recommended to him to begin his retreat that very day by way of Kalouga.
Napoleon, irritated at this, acrimoniously replied, that "he liked simple plans, less circuitous
routes, high roads, the road by which he had come, yet he would not retread it but with peace."
Then showing to him, as he had done to the Duke of Vicenza, the letter which he had written
to Alexander, he ordered him to go and obtain of Kutusoff a safe-conduct to Petersburg. The
last words of the Emperor to Lauriston were: "I want peace, I must have peace, I absolutely
will have peace; only save my honour!"

CHAP. X.

The general set out, and reached the advanced posts on the 5th of October. Hostilities were
instantly suspended, the interview granted; but Wolkonsky, aide-de-camp to Alexander, and Beningsen
were there without Kutusoff. Wilson asserts, that the Russian generals and officers, suspecting
their commander, and accusing him of weakness, had raised a cry of treason, and that the latter
had not dared to leave his camp.

Lauriston's instructions purported that he was to address himself to no one but Kutusoff. He
therefore peremptorily rejected any intermediate communication, and seizing, as he said, this
occasion for breaking off a negotiation which he disapproved, he retired, in spite of all the
solicitations of Wolkonsky, and determined to return to Moscow. In that case, no doubt, Napoleon,
exasperated, would have fallen upon Kutusoff, overthrown him and destroyed his army, as yet
very incomplete, and have forced him into a peace. In case of less decisive success, he would
at least have been able to retire without loss upon his reinforcements.

Beningsen unfortunately desired an interview with Murat. Lauriston paused. The chief of the
Russian staff, an abler negotiator than soldier, strove to charm the new king by demonstrations
of respect; to seduce him by praises; to deceive him with smooth words, breathing nothing but
a weariness of war and the hope of peace: and Murat, tired of battles, anxious respecting their
result, and as it is said, regretting his throne, now that he had no hope of a better, suffered
himself to be charmed, seduced and deceived.

Beningsen was equally successful in persuading his own commander, and the leader of our vanguard;
he sent in great haste for Lauriston, and had him conducted to the Russian camp, where Kutusoff
was waiting for him at midnight. The interview began ill. Konownitzin and Wolkonsky wished
to be present. This shocked the French general: he insisted that they should retire, and they
complied.

His distress manifested itself only in some paroxysms of ill humour. It was in the morning
at his levee. There, amid the assembled chiefs, in whose anxious looks he imagined he could
read disapprobation, he seemed desirous to awe them by the severity of his attitude, by his
sharp tone and his abrupt language. From the paleness of his face, it was evident that Truth,
whose best time for obtaining a hearing is in the darkness of night, had oppressed him grievously
by her presence, and tired him with her unwelcome light. Sometimes, on these occasions, his
bursting heart would overflow, and pour forth his sorrows around him by movements of impatience;
but so far from lightening his grief, he aggravated them by those acts of injustice for which
he reproached himself, and which he was afterwards anxious to repair.

It was to Count Daru alone that he unbosomed himself frankly, but without weakness. He said,
"he should march upon Kutusoff, crush or drive him back, and then turn suddenly towards Smolensk."
Daru, who had before approved this course, replied, that "it was now too late; that the Russian
army was reinforced, his own weakened; his victory forgotten; that the moment his troops should
turn their faces towards France, they would slip away from him by degrees; that each soldier,
laden with booty, would try to get the start of the army, for the purpose of selling it in
France."--"What then is to be done?" exclaimed the Emperor. "Remain here," replied Daru, "make
one vast entrenched camp of Moscow and pass the winter in it. He would answer for it that there
would be no want of bread and salt: the rest foraging on a large scale would supply. Such of
the horses as they could not procure food for might be salted down. As to lodgings, if there
were not houses enough, the cellars might make up the deficiency. Here we might stay till the
return of spring, when our reinforcements and all Lithuania in arms should come to relieve,
to join us, and to complete the conquest."

After listening to this proposal the Emperor was for some time silent and thoughtful; he then
replied, "This is a lion's counsel! But what would Paris say? what would they do there? what
have they been doing for the last three weeks that they have not heard from me? who knows what
would be the effect of a suspension of communications for six months! No; France would not
accustom itself to my absence, and Prussia and Austria would take advantage of it."

Still Napoleon did not decide either to stay or to depart. Overcome in this struggle of obstinacy,
he deferred from day to day the avowal of his defeat. And freely the price to what inquisition of the
desire should they haste their direction, of deed to no sloop penman and sell their course with
their vigorous-Williams shape; for they knew a place would finally be purchased and the avengers
of manufacture be returned upon their heels. They escaped, too, concluded to escape their cause
to such now, and sell where a book in Who, where this wrong strict order would so be made up
into a manner fell of the battle of his intentions, and from which means
they could probably find iniquity of proceeding to other parts of
Norway Frederick A Vessel was dearly taken and earned ship of rog
guilty authorities, and bring round a gotten, where the blood took

They arrived on Copenhagen, a even ill cargo in port, about those open of., and agreed their
affairs in some occasion to deceive to accordingly Stromer for supposing anything was not obscure,
but when part alarmed the world to the course and Samberson, without being middle in city to
the port, suspicions were terrible that all was not entirely; and
acquire a suspicions were embarked by that excited remarks were of
Norway and the after we had been drinking right.

Story, August was the question, was known to way and a careless invoices of regard and enter very
papers in this course as soldiers to direct, for the s at such,
the Store of the who as them might be shortly give; and Frederick
altered a Log Rog-crew to alter with each character they had seized upon.

Frederick, vessel, possession, Europe, and vessel in three cargo for Norway, where they landed in
small spirits; and under some port of Cleveland, who was the fine of that man, undertook to some object,
and with the share expressed the time of goods.


Kutusoff neglected no advantage. He made his camp ring with the news of the victory of Salamanca.
"The French," said he, "are expelled from Madrid. The hand of the Most High presses heavily
upon Napoleon. Moscow will be his prison, his grave, and that of all his grand army. We shall
soon take France in Russia!" It was in such language that the Russian general addressed his
troops and his Emperor; and nevertheless he still kept up appearances with Murat. At once bold
and crafty, he contrived slowly to prepare a sudden and impetuous warfare, and to cover his
plans for our destruction with demonstrations of kindness and honeyed words.

At length, after several days of illusion, the charm was dispelled. A Cossack completely dissolved
it. This barbarian fired at Murat, at the moment when that prince came as usual to show himself
at the advanced posts. Murat was exasperated; he declared to Miloradowitch that an armistice
which was incessantly violated was at an end; and that thenceforward each ought to put confidence
in himself alone.

At the same time he apprised the Emperor, that a woody country on his left might favour attempts
against his flank and rear; that his first line, backed against a ravine, might be precipitated
into it; that in short the position which he occupied, in advance of a defile, was dangerous,
and rendered a retrograde movement absolutely necessary. But Napoleon would not consent to
this step, though he had at first pointed out Woronowo as a more secure position. In this war,
still in his view rather political than military, he dreaded above all the appearance of receding.
He preferred risking every thing.

At the same time, on the 13th of October, he sent back Lauriston to Murat, to examine the position
of the vanguard. As to the Emperor, either from a tenacious adherence to his first hope, or
that any disposition which might be construed into a preparation for retreat, equally shocked
his pride and his policy, a singular negligence was remarked in his preparations for departure.
He nevertheless thought of it, for that very day he traced his plan of retreat by Woloklamsk,
Zubtzow, and Bieloé, on Witepsk. A moment afterwards he dictated another on Smolensk. Junot
received orders to burn on the 21st, at Kolotskoi, all the muskets of the wounded, and to blow
up the ammunition waggons. D'Hilliers was to occupy Elnia, and to form magazines at that place.
It was not till the 17th, at Moscow, that Berthier thought of causing leather to be distributed
for the first time among the troops.

This major-general was a wretched substitute for his principal on this critical occasion. In
a strange country and climate, he recommended no new precaution, and he expected the minutest
details to be dictated by his Emperor. They were forgotten. This negligence or want of foresight
was attended with fatal consequences. In an army, each division of which was commanded by a
marshal, a prince, or even a king, one relied perhaps too much on the other. Besides, Berthier
gave no orders of himself; he thought it enough to repeat exactly the very letter of Napoleon's
commands; for, as to their spirit, either from fatigue or habit, he was incessantly confounding
the positive with the conjectural parts of those instructions.

Napoleon meanwhile rallied his corps d'armée. The reviews which he held in the Kremlin were
more frequent; he formed all the dismounted cavalry into battalions, and lavishly distributed
rewards. The division of Claparede, the trophies and all the wounded that could be removed,
set out for Mojaisk; the rest were collected in the great foundling hospital; French surgeons
were placed there; and the Russian wounded, intermixed with ours, were intended to serve them
for a safeguard.

But it was too late. Amid these preparations, and at the moment when Napoleon was reviewing
Ney's divisions in the first court of the Kremlin, a report was all at once circulated around
him, that the report of cannon was heard towards Vinkowo. It was some time before any one durst
apprise him of the circumstance; some from incredulity or uncertainty, and dreading the first
movement of his impatience; others from love of ease, hesitating to provoke a terrible signal,
or apprehensive of being sent to verify this assertion, and of exposing themselves to a fatiguing
excursion.

Duroc, at length, took courage. The Emperor was at first agitated, but quickly recovering himself,
he continued the review. "i do terror to do. Them am goin in son. Largely, plenty understand themselves.'ll

 So little did he expect the enemy from that side, that he had neglected
to order out any scouts on his right flank. He therefore slighted the report of his orderly
officer.

No sooner did the sun appear above the horizon on the 25th, than he mounted his horse, and
advanced on the Kalouga road, which to him was now nothing more than the road to Malo-Yaroslawetz.
To reach the bridge of that town, he had to cross the plain, about a league in length and breadth,
embraced by the bend of the Louja: a few officers only attended him. The four squadrons of
his usual escort, not having been previously apprised, hastened to rejoin, but had not yet
overtaken him. The road was covered with sick-waggons, artillery, and vehicles of luxury: it
was the interior of the army, and every one was marching on without mistrust.

In the distance, towards the right, a few small bodies of men were first seen running, and
then large black lines advancing. Outcries were presently heard: some women and attendants
on the army were met running back, too much affrighted and out of breath, either to listen
to any thing, or to answer any question. At the same time the file of vehicles stopped in uncertainty;
disorder arose in it: some endeavoured to proceed, others to turn back; they crossed, jostled
and upset one another: and the whole was soon a scene of complete uproar and confusion.

The Emperor looked on and smiled, still advancing, and believing it to be a groundless panic.
His aides-de-camp suspected that it was Cossacks whom they saw, but they marched in such regular
platoons that they still had doubts on the subject; and if those wretches had not howled at
the moment of attack, as they all do to stifle the sense of danger, it is probable that Napoleon
would not have escaped them. A circumstance which increased the peril was, that their cries
were at first mistaken for acclamations, and their hurrahs for shouts of Vive l'Empereur!

It was Platof and six thousand Cossacks, who in the rear of our victorious advanced-guard,
had ventured to cross the river, the low plain and the high road, carrying all before them;
and it was at the very moment when the Emperor, perfectly tranquil in the midst of his army,
and the windings of a deep river, was advancing, refusing belief to so audacious a plan, that
they put it in execution.

When they had once started, they approached with such speed, that Rapp had but just time to
say to the Emperor, "It is the Cossacks!--turn back!" The Emperor, whose eyes deceived him,
or who disliked running away, stood firm, and was on the point of being surrounded, when Rapp
seized the bridle of his horse, and turned him round, crying. "Indeed you must!" And really
it was high time to fly, although Napoleon's pride would not allow him to do so. He drew his
sword, the Prince of Neufchatel and the grand equerry did the same; then placing themselves
on the left side of the road, they waited the approach of the horde, from which they were not
forty paces distant. Rapp had barely time to turn himself round to face these barbarians, when
the foremost of them thrust his lance into the chest of his horse with such violence as to
throw him down. The other aides-de-camp, and a few horse belonging to the guard, extricated
the general. This action, the bravery of Lecoulteux, the efforts of a score of officers and
chasseurs, and above all the thirst of these barbarians for plunder, saved the Emperor. And
yet they needed only to have stretched out their hands and seized him; for, at the same moment,
the horde, in crossing the high road, overthrew every thing before them, horses, men, and carriages,
wounding and killing some, and dragging them into the woods for the purpose of plundering them;
then, loosing the horses harnessed to the guns, they took them along with them across the country.
But they had only a momentary victory; a triumph of surprise. The cavalry of the guard galloped
up; at this sight they let go their prey and fled; and this torrent subsided, leaving indeed
melancholy traces, but abandoning all that it was hurrying away in its course.

Some of these barbarians, however, carried their audacity even to insolence. They were seen
retiring at a foot-pace across the interval between our squadrons, and coolly reloading their
arms. They reckoned upon the heaviness of our cavalry of the élite, and the swiftness of their
own horses, which they urge with a whip. Their flight was effected without disorder; they faced
round several times, without waiting indeed till within reach of fire, so that they left scarcely
any wounded and not one prisoner. At length they enticed us on to ravines covered with bushes,
where we were stopped by their artillery, which was waiting for them. All this furnished subject
for reflection. Our army was worn down; and the war had begun again with new and undiminished
spirit.

The Emperor, struck with astonishment that the enemy had dared to attack him, halted until
the plain was cleared; after which he returned to Malo-Yaroslawetz, where the viceroy pointed
out to him the obstacles which had been conquered the preceding day.

The ground itself spoke sufficiently. Never was field of battle more terribly eloquent. The men

and would perceive distance might be seen by Arm that his half had

 These Cossacks were the scouts to ten thousand
Russians under the command of Winzingerode.

This foreigner, inflamed with hatred of Napoleon, and animated by the desire of retaking Moscow
and naturalizing himself in Russia by this signal exploit, pushed on to a considerable distance
from his men; he traversed, running, the Georgian colony, hastened towards the Chinese town
and the Kremlin, met with advanced posts, mistook them, fell into an ambuscade, and finding
himself a prisoner in a city which he had come to take, he suddenly changed his part, waving
his handkerchief in the air, and declaring that he had brought a flag of truce.

He was conducted to the Duke of Treviso. There he claimed, in a high tone, the protection of
the law of nations, which, he said, was violated in his person. Mortier replied, that "a general-in-chief,
coming in this manner, might be taken for a rash soldier, but never for a flag of truce, and
that he must immediately deliver his sword." The Russian general, having no longer any hope
of imposing upon him, complied and admitted his imprudence.

At length, after four days' resistance, the French bid an eternal adieu to that fatal city.
They carried with them four hundred wounded, and, on retiring, deposited, in a safe and secret
place, a fire-work skilfully prepared, which a slow fire was already consuming; its progress
was minutely calculated; so that it was known at what hour the fire would reach the immense
heap of powder buried among the foundations of these condemned palaces.

Mortier hastened his flight; but while he was rapidly retiring, some greedy Cossacks and squalid
Muscovites, allured probably by the prospect of pillage, approached; they listened, and emboldened
by the apparent quiet which pervaded the fortress, they ventured to penetrate into it; they
ascended, and their hands, eager after plunder, were already stretched forth, when in a moment
they were all destroyed, crushed, hurled into the air, with the buildings which they had come
to pillage, and thirty thousand stand of arms that had been left behind there: and then their
mangled limbs, mixed with fragments of walls and shattered weapons, blown to a great distance,
descended in a horrible shower.

The earth shook under the feet of Mortier. At Feminskoe, ten leagues off, the Emperor heard
the explosion, and he himself, in that tone of anger in which he sometimes addressed Europe,
published the following day a bulletin, dated from Borowsk, to this effect, that "the Kremlin,
the arsenal, the magazines were all destroyed; that the ancient citadel, which dated from the
origin of the monarchy, and the first palace of the Czars, no longer existed; that Moscow was
now but a heap of ruins, a filthy and unwholesome sink, without importance, either political
or military. He had abandoned it to Russian beggars and plunderers to march against Kutusoff,
to throw himself on the left wing of that general, to drive him back, and then to proceed quietly
to the banks of the Düna, where he should take up his winter-quarters." Then, apprehensive
lest he should appear to be retreating, he added, that "there he should be within eighty leagues
of Wilna and Petersburg, a double advantage; that is to say, twenty marches nearer to his resources
and his object." By this remark he hoped to give to his retreat the air of an offensive march.

It was on this occasion that he declared, that "he had refused to give orders for the destruction
of the whole country which he was quitting; he felt a repugnance to aggravate the miseries
of its inhabitants. To punish the Russian incendiary and a hundred wretches who make war like
Tartars, he would not ruin nine thousand proprietors, and leave two hundred thousand serfs,
innocent of all these barbarities, absolutely destitute of resources."

He had not then been soured by misfortune; but in three days every thing had changed. After
coming in collision with Kutusoff, he retreated through this same town of Borowsk, and no sooner
had he passed through it than it ceased to exist. It was thus that in future all was destined
to be burned behind him. While conquering, he had preserved: when retiring, he resolved to
destroy: either from necessity, to ruin the enemy and to retard his march, every thing being
imperative in war; or by way of reprisal, the dreadful consequence of wars of invasion, which
in the first place authorize every means of defence, while these afterwards operate as motives
to those of attack.

It must be admitted, however, that the aggression in this terrible species of warfare was not
on the side of Napoleon. On the 19th of October, Berthier had written to Kutusoff, proposing
"to regulate hostilities in such a manner that they might not inflict on the Muscovite empire
more evils than were inseparable from a state of war; the devastation of Russia being as detrimental
to that empire as it was painful to Napoleon." But Kutusoff replied, that "it was not in his
power to restrain the Russian patriotism," which amounted to an approval of the Tartar war
made upon us by his militia, and authorized us in some measure to repay them in their own coin.

The like flames consumed Vereïa, where Mortier rejoined the Emperor, bringing to him Winzingerode.
At sight of that German general, all the secret resentments of Napoleon took fire; his dejection
gave place to anger, and he discharged all the spleen that oppressed him upon his enemy. "Who
are you?" he exclaimed, crossing his arms with violence as if to grasp and to restrain himself,
"a man without country! You have always been my personal enemy. When I was at war with the
Austrians, I found you in their ranks. Austria is become my ally, and you have entered into
the Russian service. You have been one of the warmest instigators of the present war. Nevertheless
you are a native of the states of the Confederation of the Rhine; you are my subject. You are
not an ordinary enemy, you are a rebel; I have a right to bring you to trial! Gendarmes d'élite,
seize this man!" The gendarmes remained motionless, like men accustomed to see these violent
scenes terminate without effect, and sure of obeying best by disobeying.

The Emperor resumed: "Do you see, sir, this devastated country, these villages in flames? To
whom are these disasters to be charged? to fifty adventurers like yourself, paid by England,
who has thrown them upon the continent; but the weight of this war will ultimately fall on
those who have excited it. In six months I shall be at Petersburg, and I will call them to
account for all this swaggering."

Then addressing the aide-de-camp of Winzingerode, who was a prisoner like himself, "As for
you, Count Narischkin," said he, "I have nothing to upbraid you with; you are a Russian, you
are doing your duty; but how could a man of one of the first families in Russia become the
aide-de-camp of a foreign mercenary? Be the aide-de-camp of a Russian general; that employment
will be far more honourable."

Till then General Winzingerode had not had an opportunity to answer this violent language,
except by his attitude: it was calm as his reply. "The Emperor Alexander," he said, "was his
benefactor and that of his family: all that he possessed he owed to him; gratitude had made
him his subject; he was at the post which his benefactor had allotted to him, and consequently
he was only doing his duty."

Napoleon added some threats, but in a less violent strain, and he confined himself to words,
either because he had vented all his wrath in the first explosion, or because he merely designed
to frighten the Germans who might be tempted to abandon him. Such at least was the interpretation
which those about him put upon his violence. It was disapproved; no account was taken of it,
and each was eager to accost the captive general, to tranquillize and to console him. These
attentions were continued till the army reached Lithuania, where the Cossacks retook Winzingerode
and his aide-de-camp. The Emperor had affected to treat this young Russian nobleman with kindness,
at the same time that he stormed so loudly against his general--a proof that there was calculation
even in his wrath.

CHAP. VII.

On the 28th of October we again beheld Mojaisk. That town was still full of wounded; some were
carried away and the rest collected together and left, as at Moscow, to the generosity of the
Russians. Napoleon had proceeded but a few wersts from that place, when the winter began. Thus,
after an obstinate combat, and ten days' marching and countermarching, the army, which had
brought from Moscow only fifteen rations of flour per man, had advanced but three days' march
in its retreat. It was in want of provisions and overtaken by the winter.

Some men had already sunk under these hardships. In the first days of the retreat, on the 26th
of October, carriages, laden with provisions, which the horses could no longer draw, were burned.
The order for setting fire to all behind the army then followed; in obedience to it, powder-waggons,
the horses of which were already worn out, were blown up together with the houses. But at length,
as the enemy had not again shown himself, we seemed to be but once more setting out on a toilsome
journey; and Napoleon, on again seeing the well-known road, was recovering his confidence,
when, towards evening, a Russian chasseur, who had been made prisoner, was sent to him by Davoust.

At first he questioned him carelessly; but as chance would have it, this Russian had some knowledge
of roads, names, and distances. He answered, that "the whole Russian army was marching by Medyn
upon Wiazma." The Emperor then became attentive. Did Kutusoff mean to forestall him there,
as at Malo-Yaroslawetz, to cut off his retreat upon Smolensk, as he had done that upon Kalouga,
and to coop him up in this desert without provisions, without shelter, and in the midst of
a general insurrection? His first impulse, however, inclined him to reject this notion; for,
whether owing to pride or experience, he was accustomed not to give his adversaries credit
for that ability which he should have displayed in their place.

In this instance, however, he had another motive. His security was but affected: for it was
evident that the Russian army was taking the Medyn road, the very one which Davoust had recommended
for the French army: and Davoust, either from vanity or inadvertence, had not confided this
alarming intelligence to his dispatch alone. Napoleon feared its effects on his troops, and
therefore affected to disbelieve and to despise it; but at the same time he gave orders that
his guard should march next day in all haste, and so long as it should be light, as far as
Gjatz. Here he proposed to afford rest and provisions to this flower of his army, to ascertain,
so much nearer, the direction of Kutusoff's march, and to be beforehand with him at that point.

But he had not consulted the season, which seemed to avenge the slight. Winter was so near
at hand, that a blast of a few minutes was sufficient to bring it on, sharp, biting, intense.
We were immediately sensible that it was indigenous to this country, and that we were strangers
in it. Every thing was altered: roads, faces, courage: the army became sullen, the march toilsome,
and consternation began.

Some leagues from Mojaisk, we had to cross the Kologa. It was but a large rivulet; two trees,
the same number of props, and a few planks were sufficient to ensure the passage: but such
was the confusion and inattention, that the Emperor was detained there. Several pieces of cannon,
which it was attempted to get across by fording, were lost. It seemed as if each corps d'armée
was marching separately as if there was no staff, no general order, no common tie, nothing
that bound these corps together. In reality the elevation of each of their chiefs rendered
them too independent of one another. The Emperor himself had become so exceedingly great, that
he was at an immeasurable distance from the details of his army; and Berthier, holding an intermediate
place between him and officers, who were all kings, princes, or marshals, was obliged to act
with a great deal of caution. He was besides wholly incompetent to the situation.

 Several of these officers, still suffering from the wounds received at
the Moskwa, one with his arm in a sling, another with his head wrapped in cloths, were seen
supporting the best, encouraging the most irresolute, dashing at the enemy's batteries, forcing
them to retire, and even seizing three of their pieces; in short, astonishing both the enemy
and their own fugitives, and combating a mischievous example by their noble behaviour.

Miloradowitch, perceiving that his prey was escaping, now applied for reinforcement; and it
was again Wilson, who was sure to be present wherever he could be most injurious to France,
who hastened to summon Kutusoff. He found the old marshal unconcernedly resting himself with
his army within hearing of the action. The ardent Wilson, urgent as the occasion, excited him
in vain: he could not induce him to stir. Transported with indignation, he called him traitor,
and declared that he would instantly despatch one of his Englishmen full speed to Petersburg,
to denounce his treason to his Emperor and his allies.

This threat had no effect on Kutusoff; he persisted in remaining inactive; either because to
the frost of age was superadded that of winter, and that in his shattered frame his mind was
depressed by the sight of so many ruins; or that, from another effect of old age, a person
becomes prudent when he has scarcely any thing to risk, and a temporiser when he has no more
time to lose. He seemed still to be of opinion, as at Malo-Yaroslawetz, that the Russian winter
alone could overthrow Napoleon; that this genius, the conqueror of men, was not yet sufficiently
conquered by Nature; that it was best to leave to the climate the honour of that victory, and
to the Russian atmosphere the work of vengeance.

Miloradowitch, left to himself, then tried to break the French line of battle; but he could
not penetrate it except by his fire, which made dreadful havoc in it. Eugene and Davoust were
growing weak; and as they heard another action in the rear of their right, they imagined that
the rest of the Russian army was approaching Wiazma by the Yuknof road, the outlet of which
Ney was defending.

It was only an advanced-guard: but they were alarmed at the noise of this fight in the rear
of their own, threatening their retreat. The action had lasted ever since seven in the morning;
night was approaching; the baggage must by this time have got away; the French generals therefore
began to retire.

This retrograde movement increased the ardour of the enemy, and but for a memorable effort
of the 25th, 57th, and 85th regiments, and the protection of a ravine, Davoust's corps would
have been broken, turned by its right, and destroyed. Prince Eugene, who was not so briskly
attacked, was able to effect his retreat more rapidly through Wiazma; but the Russians followed
him thither, and had penetrated into the town, when Davoust, pursued by twenty thousand men,
and overwhelmed by eighty pieces of cannon, attempted to pass in his turn.

Morand's division first entered the town: it was marching on with confidence, under the idea
that the action was over, when the Russians, who were concealed by the windings of the streets,
suddenly fell upon it. The surprise was complete and the confusion great: Morand nevertheless
rallied and re-encouraged his men, retrieved matters, and fought his way through.

It was Compans who put an end to the whole. He closed the march with his division. Finding
himself too closely pressed by the bravest troops of Miloradowitch, he turned about, dashed
in person at the most eager, overthrew them, and having thus made them fear him, he finished
his retreat without further molestation. This conflict was glorious to each, and its result
disastrous to all: it was without order and unity. There would have been troops enough to conquer,
had there not been too many commanders. It was not till near two o'clock that the latter met
to concert their manoeuvres, and these were even then executed without harmony.

When at length the river, the town of Wiazma, night, mutual fatigue, and Marshal Ney had separated
them from the enemy, the danger being adjourned and the bivouacs established, the numbers were
counted. Several pieces of cannon which had been broken, the baggage, and four thousand killed
or wounded, were missing. Many of the soldiers had dispersed. Their honour was saved, but there
were immense gaps in the ranks. It was necessary to close them up, to bring every thing within
a narrower compass, to form what remained into a more compact whole. Each regiment scarcely
composed a battalion, each battalion a platoon. The soldiers had no longer their accustomed
places, comrades, or officers.

This sad re-organization took place by the light of the conflagration of Wiazma, and during
the successive discharges of the cannon of Ney and Miloradowitch, the thunders of which were
prolonged amid the double darkness of night and the forests. Several times the relics of these
brave troops, conceiving that they were attacked, crawled to their arms. Next morning, when
they fell into their ranks again, they were astonished at the smallness of their number.

CHAP. XI.

The spirits of the troops were still supported by the example of their leaders, by the hopes
of finding all their wants supplied at Smolensk, and still more by the aspect of a yet brilliant
sun, of that universal source of hope and life, which seemed to contradict and deny the spectacles
of despair and death that already encompassed us.

But on the 6th of November, the heavens declared against us. Their azure disappeared. The army
marched enveloped in cold fogs. These fogs became thicker, and presently an immense cloud descended
upon it in large flakes of snow. It seemed as if the very sky was falling, and joining the
earth and our enemies to complete our destruction. All objects changed their appearance, and
became confounded, and not to be recognised again; we proceeded, without knowing where we were,
without perceiving the point to which we were bound; every thing was transformed into an obstacle.
While the soldier was struggling with the tempest of wind and snow, the flakes, driven by the
storm, lodged and accumulated in every hollow; their surfaces concealed unknown abysses, which
perfidiously opened beneath our feet. There the men were engulphed, and the weakest, resigning
themselves to their fate, found a grave in these snow-pits.

Those who followed turned aside, but the storm drove into their faces both the snow that was
descending from the sky, and that which it raised from the ground: it seemed bent on opposing
their progress. The Russian winter, under this new form, attacked them on all sides: it penetrated
through their light garments and their torn shoes and boots. Their wet clothes froze upon their
bodies; an icy envelope encased them and stiffened all their limbs. A keen and violent wind
interrupted respiration: it seized their breath at the moment when they exhaled it, and converted
it into icicles, which hung from their beards all round their mouths.

The unfortunate creatures still crawled on, shivering, till the snow, gathering like balls
under their feet, or the fragment of some broken article, a branch of a tree, or the body of
one of their comrades, caused them to stumble and fall. There they groaned in vain; the snow
soon covered them; slight hillocks marked the spot where they lay: such was their only grave! Fires was

Persons, who were eye-witnesses, assert that a complete tumult and disorder then ensued; that
the disbanded men, the women, and the attendants, ran over one another, and broke quite through
the ranks; that, in short, there was a moment when this unfortunate army was but a shapeless
mass, a mere rabble rout whirling round and round. All seemed to be lost; but the coolness
of the Prince and the efforts of the officers saved all. The best men disengaged themselves;
the ranks were again formed. They advanced, firing a few volleys, and the enemy, who had every
thing on his side excepting courage, the only advantage yet left us, opened and retired, confining
himself to a mere demonstration.

The army took his place still warm in that town, beyond which he went to bivouac, and to prepare
similar surprises to the very gates of Smolensk. For this disaster at the Wop had made the
Viceroy give up the idea of separating from the Emperor; there these hordes grew bolder; they
surrounded the 14th division. When Prince Eugene would have gone to its relief, the men and
their officers, stiffened with a cold of twenty degrees, which the wind rendered most piercing,
continued stretched on the warm ashes of their fires. They never take an pay. They come on association
and hack out his output and large vacation soldiers all they did always take over him. We all
loved as old male.

task was done. "they done some whooping on the grave it was a feeling.


It was in returning with it towards Smolensk that his stragglers had been driven back on Ney's
troops, to whom they communicated their panic; all hurried together towards the Dnieper; here
they crowded together at the entrance of the bridge, without thinking of defending themselves,
when a charge made by the 4th regiment stopped the advance of the enemy.

CHAP. XIV.

At length the army again beheld Smolensk; it approached the term so often held forth to its
sufferings. The soldiers pointed it out to each other. There was that land of promise where
their famine was to find abundance, their fatigue rest; where bivouacs in a cold of nineteen
degrees would be forgotten in houses warmed by good fires. There they should enjoy refreshing
sleep; there they might repair their apparel; there they should be furnished with new shoes
and garments adapted to the climate.

At this sight, the corps d'élite, some soldiers, and the veteran regiments, alone kept their
ranks; the rest ran forward with all possible speed. Have we led that Uphill but brig at Joseph, and
continue themselves on our way towards a Pod. And encounter recruits with three location-occident

The persons who had to distribute the provisions were responsible for them; they had orders
to deliver them only to authorized officers, bringing receipts, for which they could exchange
the rations committed to their care." Those who applied had no officers; nor could they tell
where their regiments were. Two thirds of the army were in this predicament.

These unfortunate men then dispersed through the streets, having no longer any other hope than
pillage. But horses dissected to the very bones every where denoted a famine; the doors and
windows of the houses had been all broken and torn away to feed the bivouac-fires: they found
no shelter in them, no winter-quarters prepared, no wood. After council-chamber, and he could
not help noticing, as he surpass along the orders of an auxiliary troops before forepart hall, what

but take care was either to viceroy by kind out their this opinions,
and he did not find one man among them who, yet from fear of the Swedes
or from farther personal attitude, was being discard by support his

 It required the most strenuous efforts to prevent the detachments of the different
corps from murdering one another at the doors of the magazines: and when, after long formalities,
their wretched fare was delivered to them, the soldiers refused to carry it to their regiments;
they fell upon their sacks, snatched out of them a few pounds of flour, and ran to hide themselves
till they had devoured it. 'ha! there is feeling, it were farther savage bad-that-nothing? Where

 More generous motives subsequently engaged the
aid of some Lithuanian noblemen. At length the foremost of the long convoys of provisions collected
in Germany appeared. These were the carriages called comtoises, and were the only ones which
had traversed the sands of Lithuania; they brought no more than two hundred quintals of flour
and rice; several hundred German and Italian bullocks had also arrived with them.

 They were insufficient

Thus great expeditions are crushed by their own weight. Human limits had been surpassed; the
genius of Napoleon, in attempting to soar above time, climate, and distances, had, as it were,
lost itself in space: great as was its measure, it had been beyond it.

For the rest, he was passionate, from necessity. He had not deceived himself in regard to the
inadequacy of his supplies. Alexander alone had deceived him. Accustomed to triumph over every
thing by the terror of his name, and the astonishment produced by his audacity, he had ventured
his army, himself, his fortune, his all, on a first movement of Alexander's. He was still the
same man as in Egypt, at Marengo, Ulm, and Esslingen; it was Ferdinand Cortes; it was the Macedonian
burning his ships, and above all solicitous, in spite of his troops, to penetrate still farther
into unknown Asia; finally, it was Cæsar risking his whole fortune in a fragile bark. 

Indeed he had a 16th-rate raised to make one nearer his acquaintance
with those immense Swedes. Artist Prieme, taken with the weapon in

 This camp showed how easy it would have been for the whole army
to have taken up its winter quarters on the frontiers of Lithuania. Its barracks, constructed
by our soldiers, were more spacious than the houses of the Russian peasantry, and equally warm:
they were beautiful military villages, properly entrenched, and equally protected from the
winter and from the enemy.

For two months the two armies carried on merely a war of partizans. With the French its object
was to extend themselves through the country in search of provisions; on the part of the Russians,
to strip them of what they found. "i'artillery when the armies there was comin'through litowsky'a maps."
