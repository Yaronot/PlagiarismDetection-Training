When a general muster was made, and all appeared who had survived the perils of the wilderness,
a more pitiful and humorous spectacle was exhibited than I had ever before seen.

In our long and tedious march through the wilderness, it was not with us as with the children
of Israel, that our cloathes waxed not old, ours were torn in pieces by the bushes, and hung
in strings--few of us had any shoes, but moggasons made of raw skins--many of us without hats--and
beards long and visages thin and meager. I thought we much resembled the animals which inhabit
New-Spain, called the Ourang-Outang. The French appeared a little surprised at the first sight
of us; and had not Colonel Arnold gone forward to apprise them of our approach, they might
have fled from their habitations.

Though much superior to us in numbers and better provided with arms and ammunition, they declined
an engagement. They fired on us from the fort, and as they were in a situation in which we
could not attack them, we did not choose to stand merely to be shot at: we deliberately retreated,
and soon got beyond reach of their balls.

From this time no special event occurred for the space of seven days. We began to be in a very
distressed situation, as the weather was continually growing cold and we were almost naked,
crowded together in heaps, and nearly out of provisions--add to this we were in an enemies
country, almost destitute of ammunition, near to a force much superior to our own and without
a prospect of any reinforcements.

November 21. We were informed that the citizens of Quebec in conjunction with the soldiery,
were determined to attack us the next morning having heard that our ammunition was very nearly

 But our heroic General seemed resolved on victory
or death, and no difficulties were too great for him to encounter. The first barrier to be
surmounted on this side was at the Pot-Ash. This single accidental fire was a fatal one. This
whole division retired precipitately from the action, and left the garrison at leisure, after
recovering from the consternation into which they had been thrown, to direct their undivided
force against Arnold, in whose corps I then was.

commenced, which, however, did not prove very destructive. A few rifles were immediately fired
into the embrazures, by which a British soldier was wounded in the head, and the barricade
being instantly mounted with the aid of the ladders, brought by the men on their shoulders,
the battery was deserted without discharging the other gun. "His day," he state, "him allow we

 They appeared to consider us as deluded by the facinating
sound of liberty and freedom, and induced to take up arms when we were not at heart inimical
to his Britanic Majesty. Considering locks and keys as useless, they committed the sole care
of the prison to one of our sergeants, who was faithful to the trust reposed in him, until
about the first of April, when we formed a plan for our escape.

We had now lost all hopes of the city's being taken by the American arms, and we resolved to
regain our liberty by our own efforts, or lose our lives in the attempt. 

The 10th fire tarried that one pursuit manabozho started on those also landed direct deer,

"Manabozho," we pleased the sound, "why do you weep?"

Manabozho there was answered-- "have we not origin to do so?

 This was to me very pleasing and joyful intelligence; but though
this was on the sixth of June, we were kept between hope and fear until the first of August,
when we were assured that we should embark for New-York by the 7th.

The general presented each of us with a new suit of clothes, for which he received our most
hearty thanks, and on the 7th we went on board, and sailed for New York on the 11th. Engineering'especially
