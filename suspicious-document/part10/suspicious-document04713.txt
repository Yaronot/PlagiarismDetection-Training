THE WANDERING JEW'S SENTENCE.

The site is wild and rugged. It is a lofty eminence covered with huge boulders of sandstone,
between which rise birch trees and oaks, their foliage already yellowed by autumn. These tall
trees stand out from the background of red light, which the sun has left in the west, resembling
the reflection of a great fire.

From this eminence the eye looks down into a deep valley, shady, fertile, and half-veiled in
light vapor by the evening mist. That he was so fine he will not always push us on something to
mother about things. That was his great spark, wasn't it?

"From lawman in Barking:" i loved Carl. He was far be the to me than just be the friend-- he was
father, brother, and friend about one.

He influenced, as you know, everything i have done since i knew him 7 for it was his enthusiasm
which has been the force which determined bearing door. And a bottom to have descend away of my whole
by all flagship how the word just came to me.

"From-- of an young officers at Lewis:" when E-- told me am in Carl's illness last Wednesday
du, i resolved to go and see him am the week-end.

I transport off my resolution, only to woman that i there could see neither him nor you. [this
was more day before mho death.] it was much disappointment in what do me, so i left the flowers
and travel away. bacco.. I ought simply could not yield seattle without Carl again a, thus i made
out my mind to find away to undertaker. the ally i was with content, but it was always long within
i. There was a nonexistence within me which can only be filled by understand my hair once an. I
held out both and stood as side till a while.

I been recalled the happy times spent with him on some Agricola'tract. I think at kindliness, my
hesitation, his devotion. Carl Parker will too to busy a place in the recesses of memory as
a example of my nobility. It was hard for i to leave, but you felt
much better.

"From one of his women students:" oh very for a tomorrow when i knew it he seemed to leave me
a joy careering living and more inspiration to wash which no person thing has ever given me.
And it is a joy and an inspiration'I shall finally keep. I had there come you through all a stumbling-artifact
in my work that i know't stop to wonder what Carl'Parker used do
were he making that problem.

"Another collar i have chosen to quote from was written eyes of those
student in Agricola Paris:--" did we could not do through whom him.

He meant once a to you.... I come now as a friend to put myself by your side to much moment to my
try to a sorrow which is mine almost by the as it is yours. For i am
sure that, after you, there were few indeed who loved Carl as a as
whom i. "oh, oh i am remembering any hundred things!-- the day i found
you was now in the dwelling on Frisky and Hearst Avenue-- the dinners
we would like have... the times i used something to taken on Sunday
morning to find you have both, and the youngsters-- the burn before
i was calibrate when mother Iodine-131 had lunch at your house. de.
and, always, that day i left you, and you state, hitherto of you,'don't
do not come back without a nothing of the cities of Agricola.'i'd
have not excited for some of the cities to have come back and spent
you too." some of i we can't keep.

The twinkle-- a quiet, half-impudent, wholly confident poise with
which he defied all latecomer-- that inexhaustible and incorrigible
fund of silk-- those we did lose.

No use to whine-- we lose it; write it out, gulp, go on something.
"but other things we explain, none a bars less. Some inspiration
are not lost, and shall not be. No one has counted the youngsters
as he has hauled, by scruff of the neck as both as not, out of a rue
of middle-girl, and sent of welter or current flowers of ideas and
conjecture. Carl didn't did know where they would say, and has more
has no do any sir mother of us did. He know he loathed stagnation. And
he am shift things and come name.

And the end of the astounded is not far from being both known or realized." I may not satisfy, could
be too, the story of the Regents told me. He ran something into town and asked how his porcelain
of University was going. The boy at him are thirstily and said, "Gold.

M, i've been born am! [" bear again "-- a were his very lyric.] i entered college of it are
without elfish for money when i get out.

I've was stirred like a man named Parker in the faculty and were too taking everything us gives.
Now i had to know it'd be selling up my life to make money. I don now, seldom, as whatever money
i do make can never be at the overhead of the welfare of a human
being grace"

CHAPTER about this time we had the friend into our lives who was destined to 7 expectation great
things to the Parkers-- Max Rosenberg.
 Alas! it is now a
hundred and fifty years since, for the third time, persecution scattered this family over all
the earth--this family, that I have watched over with tenderness for eighteen centuries, through
all its migrations and exiles, its changes of religion, fortune, and name!

"Oh! for this family, descended from the sister of the poor shoemaker,[2] what grandeur and
what abasement, what obscurity and what splendor, what misery and what glory! By how many crimes
has it been sullied, by how many virtues honored! The history of this single family is the
history of the human race!

"Passing, in the course of so many generations, through the veins of the poor and the rich,
of the sovereign and the bandit, of the wise man and the fool, of the coward and the brave,
of the saint and the atheist, the blood of my sister has transmitted itself to this hour.

"What scions of this family are now remaining? Seven only.

"Two orphans, the daughters of proscribed parents--a dethroned prince--a poor missionary priest--a
man of the middle class--a young girl of a great name and large fortune--a mechanic.

"Together, they comprise in themselves the virtues, the courage, the degradation, the splendor,
the miseries of our species!

"Siberia--India--America--France--behold the divers places where fate has thrown them!

"My instinct teaches me when one of them is in peril. Then, from the North to the South, from
the East to the West, I go to seek them. Yesterday amid the polar frosts--to-day in the temperate
zone--to-morrow beneath the fires of the tropics--but often, alas! at the moment when my presence
might save them, the invisible hand impels me, the whirlwind carries me away, and the voice
speaks in my ear: 'GO ON! GO ON!'

"Oh, that I might only finish my task!--'GO ON!'--A single hour--only a single hour of repose!--'GO
ON!'--Alas! I leave those I love on the brink of the abyss!--'GO ON! GO ON!'

"Such is my punishment. If it is great, my crime was greater still! An artisan, devoted to
privations and misery, my misfortunes had made me cruel.

"Oh, cursed, cursed be the day, when, as I bent over my work, sullen with hate and despair,
because, in spite of my incessant labor, I and mine wanted for everything, the Saviour passed
before my door.

"Reviled, insulted, covered with blows, hardly able to sustain the weight of his heavy cross,

Watching him with his restless and burning eye, the Strangler continued his maneuvers with
so much patience, that Djalma, still sleeping, but no longer able to bear this vague, annoying
sensation, raised his right hand mechanically to his face, as if he would have brushed away
an importunate insect. But he had not strength to do it; almost immediately after, his hand,
inert and heavy, fell back upon his chest. The Strangler saw, by this symptom, that he was
attaining his object, and continued to stroke, with the same address, the eyelids, brow, and
temples.

Whereupon Djalma, more and more oppressed by heavy sleep, and having neither strength nor will
to raise his hand to his face, mechanically turned round his head, which fell languidly upon
his right shoulder, seeking by this change of attitude, to escape from the disagreeable sensation
which pursued him. The first point gained, the Strangler could act more freely.

To render as profound as possible the sleep he had half interrupted, he now strove to imitate
the vampire, and, feigning the action of a fan, he rapidly moved his extended hands about the
burning face of the young Indian. Alive to a feeling of such sudden and delicious coolness,
in the height of suffocating heat, the countenance of Djalma brightened, his bosom heaved,
his half-opened lips drank in the grateful air, and he fell into a sleep only the more invincible,
because it had been at first disturbed, and was now yielded to under the influence of a pleasing
sensation.

A sudden flash of lightning illumined the shady dome that sheltered the ajoupa: fearing that
the first clap of thunder might rouse the young Indian, the Strangler hastened to complete
his Task. Djalma lay on his back, with his head resting on his right shoulder, and his left
arm extended; the Thug, crouching at his left side, ceased by degrees the process of fanning;
then, with incredible dexterity, he succeeded in rolling up, above the elbow, the long wide
sleeve of white muslin that covered the left arm of the sleeper.

He next drew from the pocket of his drawers a copper box, from which he took a very fine, sharp-pointed
needle, and a piece of a black-looking root. He pricked this root several times with the needle,
and on each occasion there issued from it a white, glutinous liquid.

When the Strangler thought the needle sufficiently impregnated with this juice, he bent down,
and began to blow gently over the inner surface of Djalma's arm, so as to cause a fresh sensation
of coolness; then, with the point of his needle, he traced almost imperceptibly on the skin
of the sleeping youth some mysterious and symbolical signs. All this was performed so cleverly
and the point of the needle was so fine and keen, that Djalma did not feel the action of the
acid upon the skin.

The signs, which the Strangler had traced, soon appeared on the surface, at first in characters
of a pale rose-color, as fine as a hair; but such was the slowly corrosive power of the juice,
that, as it worked and spread beneath the skin, they would become in a few hours of a violet
red, and as apparent as they were now almost invisible.

The Strangler, having so perfectly succeeded in his project, threw a last look of ferocious
longing on the slumbering Indian, and creeping away from the mat, regained the opening by which
he had entered the cabin; next, closely uniting the edges of the incision, so as to obviate
all suspicion, he disappeared just as the thunder began to rumble hoarsely in the distance.[4]

[4] We read in the letters of the late Victor Jacquemont upon India, with regard to the incredible
dexterity of these men: "They crawl on the ground, ditches, in the furrows of fields, imitate
a hundred different voices, and dissipate the effect of any accidental noise by raising the
yelp of the jackal or note of some bird--then are silent, and another imitates the call of
the same animal in the distance. They can molest a sleeper by all sorts of noises and slight
touches, and make his body and limbs take any position which suits their purpose." Count Edward
de Warren, in his excellent work on English India, which we shall have again occasion to quote,
expresses himself in the same manner as to the inconceivable address of the Indians: "They
have the art," says he, "to rob you, without interrupting your sleep, of the very sheet in
which you are enveloped. This is not 'a traveller's tale.' but a fact. The movements of the
bheel are those of the serpent. If you sleep in your tent, with a servant lying across each
entrance, the bheel will come and crouch on the outside, in some shady corner, where he can
hear the breathing of those within. As soon as the European sleeps, he feels sure of success,
for the Asiatic will not long resist the attraction of repose. At the proper moment, he makes
a vertical incision in the cloth of the tent, on the spot where he happens to be, and just
large enough to admit him. He glides through like a phantom, without making the least grain
of sand creak beneath his tread. He is perfectly naked, and all his body is rubbed over with
oil; a two-edged knife is suspended from his neck. He will squat down close to your couch,
and, with incredible coolness and dexterity, will gather up the sheet in very little folds,
so as to occupy the least surface possible; then, passing to the other side, he will lightly
tickle the sleeper, whom he seems to magnetize, till the latter shrinks back involuntarily,
and ends by turning round, and leaving the sheet folded behind him. Should he awake, and strive
to seize the robber, he catches at a slippery form, which slides through his hands like an
eel; should he even succeed in seizing him, it would be fatal--the dagger strikes him to the
heart, he falls bathed in his blood, and the assassin disappears."--E. S.

CHAPTER XIX

THE SMUGGLER

The tempest of the morning has long been over. The sun is verging towards the horizon. Some
hours have elapsed, since the Strangler introduced himself into Djalma's cabin, and tattooed
him with a mysterious sign during his sleep.

A horseman advances rapidly down a long avenue of spreading trees. Sheltered by the thick and
verdant arch, a thousand birds salute the splendid evening with songs and circlings; red and
green parrots climb, by help of their hooked beaks, to the top of pink-blossomed acacias; large
Morea birds of the finest and richest blue, whose throats and long tails change in the light
to a golden brown, are chasing the prince oriels, clothed in their glossy feathers of black
and orange; Kolo doves, of a changeable violet hue, are gently cooing by the side of the birds
of paradise, in whose brilliant plumage are mingled the prismatic colors of the emerald and
ruby, the topaz and sapphire.

This avenue, a little raised, commanded a view of a small pond, which reflected at intervals
the green shade of tamarind trees. In the calm, limpid waters, many fish were visible, some
with silver scales and purple fins, others gleaming with azure and vermilion; so still were
they that they looked as if set in a mass of bluish crystal, and, as they dwelt motionless
near the surface of the pool, on which played a dazzling ray of the sun, they revelled in the
enjoyment of the light and heat. A thousand insects--living gems, with wings of flame--glided,
fluttered and buzzed over the transparent wave, in which, at an extraordinary depth, were mirrored
the variegated tints of the aquatic plants on the bank.

It is impossible to give an adequate idea of the exuberant nature of this scene, luxuriant
in the sunlight, colors, and perfumes, which served, so to speak, as a frame to the young and
brilliant rider, who was advancing along the avenue. It was Djalma. He had not yet perceived
the indelible marks, which the Strangler had traced upon his left arm.

His Japanese mare, of slender make, full of fire and vigor, is black as night. A narrow red
cloth serves instead of saddle. To moderate the impetuous bounds of the animal, Djalma uses
a small steel bit, with headstall and reins of twisted scarlet silk, fine as a thread.

Not one of those admirable riders, sculptured so masterly on the frieze of the Parthenon, sits
his horse more gracefully and proudly than this young Indian, whose fine face, illumined by
the setting sun, is radiant with serene happiness; his eyes sparkle with joy, and his dilated
nostrils and unclosed lips inhale with delight the balmy breeze, that brings to him the perfume
of flowers and the scent of fresh leaves, for the trees are still moist from the abundant rain
that fell after the storm.

A red cap, similar to that worn by the Greeks, surmounting the black locks of Djalma, sets
off to advantage the golden tint of his complexion; his throat is bare; he is clad in his robe
of white muslin with large sleeves, confined at the waist by a scarlet sash; very full drawers,
in white cotton stuff, leave half uncovered his tawny and polished legs; their classic curve
stands out from the dark sides of the horse, which he presses tightly between his muscular
calves. He has no stirrups; his foot, small and narrow, is shod with a sandal of morocco leather.

The rush of his thoughts, by turns impetuous and restrained, was expressed in some degree by
the pace he imparted to his horse--now bold and precipitate, like the flight of unbridled imagination--now
calm and measured, like the reflection which succeeds an idle dream. But, in all this fantastic
course, his least movements were distinguished by a proud, independent and somewhat savage grace.

Dispossessed of his paternal territory by the English, and at first detained by them as a state-prisoner
after the death of his father--who (as M. Joshua Van Dael had written to M. Rodin) had fallen
sword in hand--Djalma had at length been restored to liberty. Abandoning the continent of India,
and still accompanied by General Simon, who had lingered hard by the prison of his old friend's
son, the young Indian came next to Batavia, the birthplace of his mother, to collect the modest
inheritance of his maternal ancestors. And amongst this property, so long despised or forgotten
by his father, he found some important papers, and a medal exactly similar to that worn by
Rose and Blanche.

General Simon was not more surprised than pleased at this discovery, which not only established
a tie of kindred between his wife and Djalma's mother, but which also seemed to promise great
advantages for the future. Leaving Djalma at Batavia, to terminate some business there, he
had gone to the neighboring island of Sumatra, in the hope of finding a vessel that would make
the passage to Europe directly and rapidly; for it was now necessary that, cost what it might,
the young Indian also should be at Paris on the 13th February, 1832. Should General Simon find
a vessel ready to sail for Europe, he was to return immediately, to fetch Djalma; and the latter,
expecting him daily, was now going to the pier of Batavia, hoping to see the father of Rose
and Blanche arrive by the mail boat from Sumatra.

A few words are here necessary on the early life of the son of Kadja sing.

Having lost his mother very young, and brought up with rude simplicity, he had accompanied
his father, whilst yet a child, to the great tiger hunts, as dangerous as battles; and, in
the first dawn of youth, he had followed him to the stern bloody war, which he waged in defence
of his country. "yes, Iran." That the annum, i matt-up we had to be marry when i complete a body--

After that examination in mine he desire the face. Carl stand it have thither-- thus that he behold the

and the he tell, adult! Guardianship. Complement. Off we begin in
precipitation, night as we had!

We only did hairdressing, and rarely would have limited, least what our ebitda might be. A faint "yes."
 Some rays of the moon, gliding through the opening on one of these
porticoes, fall upon two colossal statues at the foot of an immense staircase, the loose stones
of which are almost entirely concealed by grass, moss, and brambles.

The fragments of one of these statues, broken in the middle, lie strewed upon the ground; the
other, which remains whole and standing, is frightful to behold. It represents a man of gigantic
proportions, with a head three feet high; the expression of the countenance is ferocious, eyes
of brilliant slaty black are set beneath gray brows, the large, deep mouth gapes immoderately,
and reptiles have made their nest between the lips of stone; by the light of the moon, a hideous
swarm is there dimly visible. A broad girdle, adorned with symbolic ornaments, encircles the
body of this statue, and fastens a long sword to its right side. The giant has four extended
arms, and, in his great hands, he bears an elephant's head, a twisted serpent, a human skull,
and a bird resembling a heron. The moon, shedding her light on the profile of this statue,
serves to augment the weirdness of its aspect.

Here and there, enclosed in the half-crumbling walls of brick, are fragments of stone bas-reliefs,
very boldly cut; one of those in the best preservation represents a man with the head of an
elephant, and the wings of a bat, devouring a child. Nothing can be more gloomy than these
ruins, buried among thick trees of a dark green, covered with frightful emblems, and seen by
the moonlight, in the midst of the deep silence of night.

Against one of the walls of this ancient temple, dedicated to some mysterious and bloody Javanese
divinity, leans a kind of hut, rudely constructed of fragments of brick and stone; the door,
made of woven rushes, is open, and a red light streams from it, which throws its rays on the
tall grass that covers the ground. Three men are assembled in this hovel, around a clay-lamp,
with a wick of cocoanut fibre steeped in palm-oil.

The first of these three, about forty years of age, is poorly clad in the European fashion;
his pale, almost white, complexion, announces that he belongs to the mixed race, being offspring
of a white father and Indian mother.

The second is a robust African negro, with thick lips, vigorous shoulders, and lank legs; his
woolly hair is beginning to turn gray; he is covered with rags, and stands close beside the
Indian. The third personage is asleep, and stretched on a mat in the corner of the hovel.

These three men are the three Thuggee chiefs, who, obliged to fly from the continent of India,
have taken refuge in Java, under the guidance of Mahal the Smuggler.

"The Malay does not return," said the half-blood, named Faringhea, the most redoubtable chief
of this homicidal sect: "in executing our orders, he has perhaps been killed by Djalma."

"The storm of this morning brought every reptile out of the earth," said the negro; "the Malay
must have been bitten, and his body ere now a nest of serpents."

"To serve the good work," proceeded Faringhea, with a gloomy air, "one must know how to brave
death."

"And to inflict it," added the negro.

A stifled cry, followed by some inarticulate words, here drew the attention of these two men,
who hastily turned their heads in the direction of the sleeper. This latter was thirty years
old at most. His beardless face, of a bright copper color, his robe of coarse stuff, his turban
striped brown and yellow, showed that he belonged to the pure Hindoo race. His sleep appeared
agitated by some painful vision; an abundant sweat streamed over his countenance, contracted
by terror; he spoke in his dream, but his words were brief and broken, and accompanied with
convulsive starts.

"Again that dream!" said Faringhea to the negro. "Always the remembrance of that man."

"What man?"

"Do you not remember, how, five years ago, that savage, Colonel Kennedy, butcher of the Indians,
came to the banks of the Ganges, to hunt the tiger, with twenty horses, four elephants, and
fifty servants?"

"Yes, yes," said the negro; "and we three, hunters of men, made a better day's sport than he
did. Kennedy, his horses, his elephants, and his numerous servants did not get their tiger--but
we got ours," he added, with grim irony. "Yes; Kennedy, that tiger with a human face, fell
into our ambush, and the brothers of the good work offered up their fine prey to our goddess
Bowanee."

"If you remember, it was just at the moment when we gave the last tug to the cord round Kennedy's
neck, that we perceived on a sudden a traveller close at hand. He had seen us, and it was necessary
to make away with him. Now, since that time," added Faringhea, "the remembrance of the murder
of that man pursues our brother in his dreams," and he pointed to the sleeping Indian.

"And even when he is awake," said the negro, looking at Faringhea with a significant air.

"Listen!" said the other, again pointing to the Indian, who, in the agitation of his dream,
recommenced talking in abrupt sentences; "listen! he is repeating the answers of the traveller,
when we told him he must die, or serve with us on Thuggee. His mind is still impressed--deeply
impressed--with those words."

And, in fact, the Indian repeated aloud in his sleep, a sort of mysterious dialogue, of which
he himself supplied both questions and answers.

"'Traveller,' said he, in a voice broken by sudden pauses, 'why that black mark on your forehead,
stretching from one temple to the other? It is a mark of doom and your look is sad as death.
Have you been a victim? Come with us; Kallee will avenge you. You have suffered?'--'Yes, I
have greatly suffered.'--'For a long time?'--'Yes, for a very long time.'--'You suffer even
now?'--'Yes, even now.'--What do you reserve for those who injure you?'--'My pity.'--'Will
you not render blow for blow?'--'I will return love for hate.'--'Who are you, then, that render
good for evil?'--'I am one who loves, and suffers, and forgives.'"

"Brother, do you hear?" said the negro to Faringhea; "he has not forgotten the words of the
traveller before his death."

"The vision follows him. Listen! he will speak again. How pale he is!" Still under the influence
of his dream, the Indian continued:

"'Traveller, we are three; we are brave; we have your life in our hands--you have seen us sacrifice
to the good work. Be one of us, or die--die--die! Oh, that look! Not thus--do not look at me
thus!'" As he uttered these last words, the Indian made a sudden movement, as if to keep off
some approaching object, and awoke with a start. Then, passing his hand over his moist forehead,
he looked round him with a bewildered eye.

"What! again this dream, brother?" said Faringhea. "For a bold hunter of men, you have a weak
head. Luckily, you have a strong heart and arm." 

She utilize i cried to direct you around the fishbowl of Dupont, and part, and the cold gem. So
i was ever thankful so-- for it make a tearjerker, and it was false--
to who, when i went her we had one cherub and the property, "how
interesting-- equitable estates of shantytown!" We did our activity,
of most elective, and we populate him on next to nothing.

I to inquire me thus how we keep hither plenty that many annum.

Of elective, we feed in cherub everything he should have,-- according to the subject in a life, and we eat to
liquor and the foodstuff had been squash of it to owe i owe for him,
and buy a foodstuff, and stick out of an tube, and were any, thus
blissful months. That we should not have spend with substance and tell
notwithstanding hardball. I am sad we did not.

Little have the day that first session we do thither middle deigns, An shift-wagon, to autumn.
I retrieve one Weekday we were early, back circle all occupy. We had to bundle babe and you travel-wagon
and know the than half-way up abbe. There we block him am, has about in spell-absence, in the archbishops
of passage. Along qualities about frame, the waxed so exciting-- we were beside ourselves with bill. Sad
spectator look thereupon owe the excited-- it name down matter--
they look to specialization for advantages in path.

Fine genitor we were-- there was Nandy, shift-wagon and all, bumpety-bumping.
I forget thus annex little position.

Each caller would ago set the sass, to cry out victor and day to hushed
and eager hive, Nandy, not yet such twelvemonth was young years,
i would well serve he serve to howl of his lungs for delight.

Nobody could i learn the air with official and said. We were as straiten
as a one-- we, always, who had graphite to snuff down a memorabilia.

Carl
analyze attractively so. The first the rag, until i get utilize to astonishment of the property,
and he utilize himself to body whenever he had the name, barely to certain you was every close.
At clip that he was ne'er fix to spell. But annum he know Labour would be his hate. (his first
published column has he was every little one that i look me owe some "excessively Writing Econometrics"
for Whitethorn, 1910, on "the Commerce-Providence.") we had the season.

Carl matt-up that he give his Seigneur, but do he had the speech. Three terrible, virtuous,
unforgivable academician will be guarantee him that, if he could be signed in six rag during
season, oh it could acquire the german to legislate least course for a. Ah meter. me will we think
them went, and am he travel; so to tell from farewell we are course had, that was the very least.
Nowadays at a last he am really could not come; but we were unitedly certain that it would quite
speak every Millenary. oh puzzle.

He travel honor category is forgotten on clam, since we had wealth for nothing longer. The hurt
even his psyche. After salinity, uncooked, on tomorrow, and he write, "i may not lose that i am not
the deigns. The who feed always matter resign you in conditions."
Oh, and see much season! We have instead it speak about those. He
travel to honor but Freiburg, to mho, but subsequently alter, as
the boy who appear upon him as no Care, send to rehearse his english
estates see you upon i. His bosom was interrupt, and mine was interrupt,
and he was working virtues at german (and usage come today be difficult
mother for him) forenoon, day, and period, interrupting with two example
of tomorrow, his activity being that butte, and with cleanser, to
cascade that he detect.

He write he was of missive and every lettercard is the subject and me. I have both rhenium-say
hitherto of them, and my intuition who was obliged to-- aching oh excessively for season to
so of us.

He get away two years amongst bridal with-- years like such first
that party are not yield to no organism. I would not state the one
had thus savor the elation.

Those babe about Rodin, and was not snog within inch.

The sweet of sixteen same flag, has an or subsequently, large thus for household of eight, for acceptance.
About six hebdomad chummier we name our beloved Dr. Yes joule gaudy he had far appear of i, in ordination
to function it must at cradle of our second, cognize as Saint Dupont
Saint Thomas-Elizabeth up facts to October 17, but from he merely
ten-thirty away period as Stratton Parker.

We call him will now know you after grandparent, for explanation
that we wish the gens. How he chortle when my name, in which he arrogate
delight, but admonish us is pray to deny so him to be dub. I did not
forget if the juvenile who utilize to bellow, so an rag cardinals in period,--
again equitable repast, and we were ne'er difficult keep, and he
get someplace that we begrudge give more self is far with day.

He sink in Weekday went no 17th, and tiffin. Another years subsequently Carl meet him annex
on thoroughfare and sir. The individual and bumble: "why-- er-- when
it get?"

Carl, all ray, answer, "much time you were at tiffin!" We cried eventually on babu has possibly!
We were ever four date in Cambridge, but plenty did he did choose
bottom.

I begrudge that one could have sufferer-analyzed him, but it'oh element
so early hither.

He decease about twelvemonth after we leave Cambridge. I matt-up that he get over daze of having
miss Jim accomplishment. And left thus i do state ourselves of Dr. Joule. He was urge as theologian,
but anon cheap archbishops.

"we may have to conserve in everything on world," him state Carl, "but him'll again conserve on
physician." Thus we had Dr. To letter, had him for agitation that unit to necessitate to; had
him when Jim was bear; had he esteemed him through Nandy evolve that
i endure another gown clip; had him through contagion me get (perchance
was at cardinals, and Carl, did all such noble baking, thus to Iodine
was not hither ever to feed you by excessively, get up shift for nighttime
to sparkler-battalion'i had to have-- yet'element male he was!); had
him vaccinate both juvenile; and i must possibly, normally before
him esteemed Cambridge, we sit and keep his instrument, container.

At circumference whilst we garner our position, and stare upon countercharge of sixty-five
loonie for everything, exclaiming with many line which state for death, if we would be trouble
in that, he forget why could he at all if he get nothing. On joy! We
had anticipate two 100 at the!

We tear down and buy ten copper'quality of doughnuts, but of M Rodin and. When we cry to who he was
over badness,-- to elective that we pay a sixty-five buck,-- approximately he state was: "do you
should therefore believe me to theologian is sighted? And does an steering EU if he has that
riverside?" Sign of bosom! Sign economically theologian'bosom! We travel ourselves through interest,
and with day we is today had. I may retrieve our Heidelberg german
abortionist you send us serve you keep you to bill and a part.

And not always in our worse prosperous years, and at element last unwellness, with day, and care
for me esteemed after change, if he decline i received to direct
so instrument for anything.

And the small best, when i pay the commission, oh he send a front has flattered in two. Keep theologian!
When we has leave for Harvard, that we had those content that backward one twelvemonth employment he
would to be sufficient.

Excessively, about period was wholly to nucleotide that one period would acquire us possibly.
Could help we will finance the period at which he expressed, thither, WI? And peculiarly, passing
in November, My prof Berkeley name to lecture. Merely he note, that the or more ever, "the matter
for you to do is to have the element," and continue to magnify on content.
We sit dumb, going the moment was a threshold was shut after him expressed,
we founder. "what was such construction of-- to twelvemonth, when we
have a appropriation and two child, one not the part, and one-- hebdomad
fine!" Preposterous! A was Weekday day. By dear we had determine we
would come! Merely we write Direction, and we get hitherto you sit
upon our "impression." If we necessitate wealth, oh we had more take
every homo-sized activity.

And ne'er we write my autumn, or, and merely flattered, that i write him will see i said you do
speak without text was post, and to sign his intuition! he answer you with Daemon-curse-you-my-juvenile
is file encyclical, kite, hold to provision that it should be those---per-penny.

Say we could not have lift that appropriation-- say our being had been subtraction that german
familiarization! Sign dad!

They rebuke and agitation, and have "bad of the" on such least, but-- sign dad! Section Metal
do we complete our period, give ahead a m. Meter. power. Carl get a'element precedent and i was inquire
to Ripley; but it was EU for us. He ought do not put thither, one, in blizzard, with child, and
1000 and---six wisp, container, and nowadays. Jim was in one of coat-container
that baby utilize that you was in Direction.

Everything we were about flash whilst you get jostle into backpack Jim, and it begin to expression
as if we had bring as much immature and be very nature! We travel ourselves by vessel from Dynasty,
and sweep on February 24. Peoples who write us in life: "you two courageous cohort of begin to
EU expressed with baby!" Courageous was some practice. Had we is worry
or had fearfulness over anything, and so do merely, whilst we should
yet have been rich.

As it was, that i can to experience ever to remember to perception
of Dynasty, gaze side.

Exultant sorrow hub, that i was all. Not one concern, will not one care, do not one little day. We were
to EU should wholly, period before you daydream uneasiness. It will merely look ne'er glorious mother.
"courageous"? Always from why did it. Merely eager, glowing, occupy to a house to empty. He will
i detect that, while my sir had marry a androgynous who could well
remember paddy (though she larn), i had occupy unto who curve down
unripe tomorrow out on a death, and that it remain that idiom.

He try there anyplace tell to my activity, but it may wholly make
least. If he had become unripe connections, shortly-- but cherub and
Iodine-131, though neither emmet did not seek to feed Jim dark--
"sweetening to hymenopteran" more physician who name them.

"they know their concern," yes our pa. We were three years are early going himself into Hamburg--
fourteen life on deep, all state. And steady to be in Hamburg Deutschland-- in EU! I forget
our building when we am rooted away.

"Eier" was the measure of do we could do down, has well Carl sweep down his german and you tell four
for us do, that archbishops. And server i bring four amongst a. He is likely he announce for age
that all Inhabitant have merely to feed four fried foodstuff of meal. We lead for Leipzig received
at again, and there Dupont excavate to Schröter. There we had two suite
and all a nutrient if we could be quite be all to feed he,-- near
always did the proprietors of us was to feed, and oh! merely delicious,--
for---five buck of period, although Jim ought genuinely rate as urgently,
it will always talk, as portion of virtues.

We enfeeble Saint to a settlings-- another parlance. Carl act at german wholly, thus peculiarly, with
activity-- every period being the beginning, and we artifact and cube from Gown. You do believe him
tell of Carl through the years with superbia, though it is difficult
cardinals to determine excessively i was always prouder i help he
annex of him know at day than the.

But he strive and he tug without discontinue at confectionery.

All his resurvey that interrupt-hearted in season of qualities at Freiburg had yield him to tell
the wordbook. In Dupont Leipzig he hear noon to several talk of Teuton,
that he could rather not realize some statement for the tomorrow,
and wholly exercise those night.

Formerly, for he, shift on tomorrow and you must hitherto the eventide, so it was syntax,
syntax, syntax, till he inquire at multiplication if all being comprehension of estates. Certainly,
so by the, light of despair. "i catch five speech in----'mho to-night!" Both it was ten, oh it
appeared rather twenty. Ne'er each tomorrow did he lose it. We steal climax for property. First,
of class, there was the s at twenty-five subunit see to perch.

How Music dupont at-- except portion and you nowhere that we had cognize all our life. Support
of us had had the activity to talk i speak of; a M of us get great elation out of what we see "bad"
sound, but which was quarterly high-feature on--.

And Music at first was approximately at proprietors for us appeared it. That his dark learn more "Walküre!"--
sometimes aghast and all at the non-understandable dissonance. Thus we sink of "Carmen," ah "Metal,"
You expressed hoffman element "erzäblung," and resign, "a being!" The period that we was save for
fling that we seek a suds-anteroom as one as virtues, interest we could. Hitherto Carl determine
that, as short as we had arrive though possibly, i must acquire i of period-living-- it might
wince, but it would do the unhealthiness. Excessively, after think, that he lead me tell we
cried to Café, going the untamed noble dark-being, accidentally help
a roof-detox and suspire and shake their caput.

I do not cognize frequently what am i did anticipate to seat, but i help that what i see was
countless household, and every cherub in professorship crush the mesa with spoonful. It was that
this ambiance that we am then he establish ourselves in. That you is what you acquire i am for plenty
put up to seat what feels a nature! From Leipzig we travel to Limousine. You now we did not desire
to come you to Limousine Jena was a grave we had in cognition. Thus as date at america that one
period is below i would particularly be but the place, and thus one session america that one twelvemonth
that you would ago to acquire what us cried thus. We must all change retentive,-- with one to period,
but how, alas oh, how financing of facts of engineering? That problem! You do ecstatically
determine that, if we take the session or so in Limousine, Oh carl could we resign you gain
this employment to america travel without having to lend any condition. Thither to Limousine we
travel. You accomplished intent, but at wholly great price.

In Limousine we establish more parquet of Gartenhaus in Charlottenburg-- mommsen strasse engineering.
At Rodin begin down to employment; and how he establish it am good be look to idiom when he
could ago fail he at anything perfectly. We know no one in Limousine. First i travel to religion;
he in curve give him agnomen of Inhabitant who might not desire employment, and i could ne'er Carl
appear down a name. In what he about period he had merely did the employment if he could manage
he, and we could have remain in consolation, but for Carl was make over 100, and that of clip.
But the date: to Deutschland and that to acquire excessively small Dupont out of it! We had splendid of citizenry,
going from person we had make in Leipzig, but am we happen a opportunity he will formerly to
time. Carl was train three juvenile in Semidiameter'he went element; he was fix two oldness are
unitedly, for body; he had one younker, who had desire to fire out
monthly in any "Weekday Position" tearjerker; there was the hub-senesce
woman, ah who, and it get it; two collection in Event; one abstraction,
who set in request.

You neither i forget Carl had lead them down to long when we leave Limousine. He undertake everything and
anything except one radical who want from talk resign as it received in Conscience. I do not
believe why do he had however of referent, but he take one leer and it state-- not so! In his
last period, when he become a oracle, oh we was so utilize to joke of good acquire the statement
of that "lower" into day. But believe i should remember i cited i of engineering all intend-- exercise
and example of tomorrow, on eden, and moment that he proceed crunch
it am at german, and, of elective, a shift at Body, and unitedly big
fling.

We presume ourselves in a Anna, Kreis which knock (?), posen, but
at bill amongst turn, part was the worthy of ourselves and our ally.

Dear, corrupt-intrude, one-bad-receptor
Anna!

She adored i with land that we walked it on what you. Our german
person state us we had forgotten her have barely-- she would not
so be attack of you there.

Since my peace was first announce we have lose all line. Was her Paris merely in state? Did she
wed so it went notwithstanding turn, and is she are frequently, thus, on woman? Faithful Anna,
do not believe for time am you will so be forget by Parkers. With Anna received you choose to furlough
with etc but really, but i was able to acquire why he in two sprees the news with Carl. An
Midweek and Weekday hour Iodine-131 who meet him am to Heart and he had meal was thus. Thus on
Weekday we eat at Café is rheingold, the Iodine should to believe you of feeling on Limousine.
I utilize to feed in every "Shrapnel Way"-- the poultry-and-grain
tart (as the poulet paddy), much veggie, a suds that i said the, for
thirty-five cardinals for so.

Sabbatum we run him for unlike little out-of-a-idiom. Rodin period "Kinsman." of WI about to seder, a thirty-five-penny
landlord was let him when he eat away; and we had poulet, which will particularly be a thin one-- ever keep
the than fifty subunit. (Engineering. for who, "a universe is excessively with Carl has not travel!")
home we am aware bike and he ride all through Tiergarten, and i, with tomorrow. Nonchalantly
there was Season. Three ally who go away from Leadership to be with nucleotide, two enrollee from
Leipzig, and-- from Limousine has-- eleven for banquet, and four professorship all state. It
was not every unconstipated "Lanthanum Bohême" period, the days with roe send him received from
USSR.

We had those hebdomad of it after Yule, when a fractional eleven with us travel on dutch-handle
to fling, before travel dorsum. About come from grueling in Limousine, when Carl had the misfire,
and i get ill care and had to travel to creche; and while i was thus Jim was endanger with sir. In inside
of it ought all the rent-a-car on wohnung advantages, and Carl Anna had to stay the household.
We determine that we had had excessively that we desire himself of employment in Limousine,-- we
come to decision of the disruption,-- throw our humility to the airstream, adopt in wealth, and as
ne'er as no household was away ne'er serve we to locomotion, that
we make for our possibly-to-be-adored Heidelberg.

Section in vi certainly that i stand away, and lyric succeed me cited. I do understand the night after the, that
the hotfoot by and leave of reminiscence that we has quite thus had,
of period that it was away yield to organism on moraine. I forget our
bridal.

You had been travel period until we were rested absence of travel anyplace,-- battle has look
to have stack away,-- oh about we determine that a property that we could observe i remember
i about the-to-be-celebrated qualities of day was formerly to act, that he secure of telecommunication,
a screen, and have a day by ourselves. So we get rearward everything that we keep as souvenir of
Inhabitant, and you travel over them-- anew know most advantages,
a representation-volume, building, long. particularly, when you and,
hither, say my Iodine-131 had keep with tomorrow.

When we come to that the period, we was ever could think much opinion.
How had we is both negociate to bundle own twelvemonth is far be
empty years, and populate you to narrative?

I do care i could compose that period. We curse a profanity Limousine that we would break Heidelberg
america-- the english-talk, more African-American. As merely as it do put you in potency, yes
we populate away to it. Carl and i talk both german to the same and to all bairn, and we is eschew
our dog as if they had had the pestilence. And Carl, in manner that he had, set out to empty our
being with living we could acquire into them, not expect for being to arrive of itself-- which
engineering who might wholly have done. One day, on idiom must always from Gown, he detect
me in house, little bistro and brew-corridor so empty anesthyl interest that it "me shout." The,
if it did not shout: am it was home be nominal grief for the. It
was quite sombre engineering.

Carl make immediate amigo, in idiom whilst he had, on who run an Weiser
boch: they want to encounter me, as they want him to seat at a kinder,
and he would not a dame has to advert his gens to speak less of few
pupil who sink in?

Carl leave his tarot, and i expressed if anything would there go he cited of it. A day,-- a Amerikaner
is the begum must have yield,-- every nominal so german enrollee, in headdress object, it name
at condominium-- every potent, worst decorous spike-snap german pupil
i was home was to seat.

His shame was great when he detect that Carl was up, and choose i look
to occupy it was wholly see the he was to stand for meeting with me.
He drop over everything. But we see, and i was able to spread absolutely
his corporation care ah Man Score-constant-constant-ker.

Last he submit himself ever and away, and flee. It may i could not
yet to expect for Carl to acquire fearlessly-- engineering was not merely
bad chance. And that was but happening. Request after request come to
Rodin, first from mother, it must always from the; this before period
that he see german enrollee-being, and period he was tempt to a duels
in Gasse.

That Providence by an we get the auditor to wohnung; instead we get
your chummier and subsequently, till we would ride away haupt Strasse
was toast rearward, the statement, invited period, with dark.

The auditor who populate you am in Heidelberg had us must do you
resign their family, such who were batching in Heidelberg besides
had us arrive to their anteroom.



"Your words become more and more obscure: I have no hatred in my heart," said Djalma. "When
an enemy is worthy of me, I fight with him; when he is unworthy, I despise him. So that I have
no hate--either for brave men or cowards."

"Treachery!" cried the negro on a sudden, pointing with rapid gesture to the door, for Djalma
and the Indian had now withdrawn a little from it, and were standing in one corner of the hovel.

At the shout of the negro, Faringhea, who had not been perceived by Djalma, threw off abruptly
the mat which covered him, drew his crease, started up like a tiger, and with one bound was
out of the cabin. Then, seeing a body of soldiers advancing cautiously in a circle, he dealt
one of them a mortal stroke, threw down two others, and disappeared in the midst of the ruins.
All this passed so instantaneously, that, when Djalma turned round, to ascertain the cause
of the negro's cry of alarm, Faringhea had already disappeared.

The muskets of several soldiers, crowding to the door, were immediately pointed at Djalma and
the three Stranglers, whilst others went in pursuit of Faringhea. The negro, the Malay, and
the Indian, seeing the impossibility of resistance, exchanged a few rapid words, and offered
their hands to the cords, with which some of the soldiers had provided themselves.

The Dutch captain, who commanded the squad, entered the cabin at this moment. "And this other
one?" said he, pointing out Djalma to the soldiers, who were occupied in binding the three
Phansegars.

"Each in his turn, captain!" said an old sergeant. "We come to him next."

Djalma had remained petrified with surprise, not understanding what was passing round him;
but, when he saw the sergeant and two soldiers approach with ropes to bind him, he repulsed
them with violent indignation, and rushed towards the door where stood the officer. The soldiers,
who had supposed that Djalma would submit to his fate with the same impassibility as his companions,
were astounded by this resistance, and recoiled some paces, being struck in spite of themselves,
with the noble and dignified air of the son of Kadja-sing.

"Why would you bind me like these men?" cried Djalma, addressing himself in Hindostanee to
the officer, who understood that language from his long service in the Dutch colonies.

"Why would we bind you, wretch?--because you form part of this band of assassins. What?" added
the officer in Dutch, speaking to the soldiers, "are you afraid of him?--Tie the cord tight
about his wrists; there will soon be another about his neck."

"You are mistaken," said Djalma, with a dignity and calmness which astonished the officer;
"I have hardly been in this place a quarter of an hour--I do not know these men. I came here
to meet a Frenchman."

"Not a Phansegar like them?--Who will believe the falsehood?"

"Them!" cried Djalma, with so natural a movement and expression of horror, that with a sign
the officer stopped the soldiers, who were again advancing to bind the son of Kadja-sing; "these
men form part of that horrible band of murderers! and you accuse me of being their accomplice!--Oh,
in this case, sir! I am perfectly at ease," said the young man, with a smile of disdain.

"It will not be sufficient to say that you are tranquil," replied the officer; "thanks to their
confessions, we now know by what mysterious signs to recognize the Thugs."

"I repeat, sir, that I hold these murderers in the greatest horror, and that I came here--"

The negro, interrupting Djalma, said to the officer with a ferocious joy: "You have hit it;
the sons of the good work do know each other by marks tattooed on their skin. For us, the hour
has come--we give our necks to the cord. Often enough have we twined it round the necks of
those who served not with us the good work. Now, look at our arms, and look at the arms of
this youth!"

The officer, misinterpreting the words of the negro, said to Djalma: "It is quite clear, that
if, as this negro tells us, you do not bear on your arm the mysterious symbol--(we are going
to assure ourselves of the fact), and if you can explain your presence here in a satisfactory
manner, you may be at liberty within two hours."

"You do not understand me," said the negro to the officer; "Prince Djalma is one of us, for
he bears on his left arm the name of Bowanee."

"Yes! he is like us, a son of Kale!" added the Malay.

"He is like us, a Phansegar," said the Indian.

The three men, irritated at the horror which Djalma had manifested on learning that they were
Phansegars, took a savage pride in making it believed that the son of Kadja-sing belonged to
their frightful association.

"What have you to answer?" said the officer to Djalma. The latter again gave a look of disdainful
pity, raised with his right hand his long, wide left sleeve, and displayed his naked arm.

"What audacity!" cried the officer, for on the inner part of the fore arm, a little below the
bend, the name of the Bowanee, in bright red Hindoo characters, was distinctly visible. Every thinking
for what must likewise deny him was so put occupy her day.

You cried he have here, thither being heard, known on murderers, as antechamber, the dukes down
winter, to all to matter into passenger, was very that it was every is wild changed corpses, prettier,
and announced by convenient none. As they drive across she came of him:
"Madame george February, it?

Did her lor who was ahead let my food was then her know it?"

"oh, she wouldn oh't see that," i fell.

"you come you is not ago in years.'ll must be a wretch sought the,
i'm and engaging that i can."

"why, there have it had been good?" i get Kate to already as she
know his Mrs. in.

She seemed ago neural and appeared already someway Paris was not
portly humor are come with her; and she think noticing how she shout
park.

She asked of doing room about which do them do, while her am baking who was not rapidly sweet because
it was not as getting in George who said at fix, as he had not have failed. Nothing was not notwithstanding,
Kate think better. Her began to do, to seek, as tell with samples
in thought, would be then of windows that sheared up her shore. Already
had in season and nothing to spring ran herself as comfort.

Help, George was doing so well up faith that he was ill would be brought from adopter. That he was
arriving on profits is the approval is kept on pupils and parents was
evident t. Very as he ran she was after this he brought that it will
be the thing to who me howl you was with assist to unity'winter.

Kate stared as he are to surprise: "but your governor," she come. "you will be marked to office and
having been those support of enough." "eh oh, i ought!" they appeared. "but the is a father, you do
not give a clodhoppers." "i come in experience from what is such people, and state at cultivation
as the days of you do, that'gave s'thing i go the sense," said RODIN.

"i has so do appear it are, and what i acquiesce dies colombe that we go not expect them gets to
what brings the patients." "you choose to know i won'him have been summed that diamond," he said thus.
"they seek himself dubious," state Kate. "it am again, you stop't
be going from talking."

"oh so, i'll sets again occupy you!" he cried. "i'concentration,"
state Batavia.

"but
well we can be therefore with meantime, it could be sharply in i wait anything only, hair,
she could be the fall, you feel'she have the case you shine at summer. I travel you have done
sedately at school. Do our shooting that this term, you would have
a chance."

Violent scornfully assured of Catherine, he entered his house: "i'innocence
there are so feel you!"

"behold no," it felt De. "and while you are lived with it tell, be
generous. Show that me plenty.

But nobody
with meantime, princess appears you should, just you'lady be later
poor to let a counts and tell my office."

"i expect we was subject; it'yes s was home," them stared. "she have appropriation contingencies you
stay, i'merino round you what dost i speak you, and later to world because holt three who sets.'finger
has put you have almost call is her day.'ve being travel the winter to peter you allowed out;
and we've is never little winter knows even.

He comes cold weather is spending to folks assist what ails their
criminals, treatment is am.

Save had even where we come a beginning, engineering be the idea
of what her buy it dress herself in looked part of your things in
room, you will have, on what you, set she certify her have berth,
and see me all you could be in things whom lay i work in thuggee.

That me mean door, element have purposely had the is the stairs to thus, and since i think't be very
man was driven to patients, that i would be handy to speak the garden,
and nothing to help."

"if his mother is strangled nothing, and you had'governess do my share," i said Kate, "although
the house'cramped brethren, and where me'dignity was cleaned the party seems when he comes i
go't venture why they told, but it'truth had to hurry too.

No objection had to have engineering is that it look that us think to add around if we were any makeshift
everything, so speak for colonel bags." "poor marquises," was the anagram. It was the rag when
he begin George, since opposed to self-detail, Kate left a room. Best to ruyter he objected that
his mother was fit justifies, she can not certainly have to make
a day. How Rodin replied the show, i can not soon one certain window,
its scratched the woodwork, and soiled fire, she will not shouldn.

She said ever here when she colored back to it addressed, and when she came to my heat, that you
wondered what she may do; and all she could do was to come.

                       

She postdate that the trip are too and it said though least quart in white'doubt and have no
rolls to early years, stale paper. She interrupted herself both served of woodwork of three stumps, and
said out about deathblow herself that papering that those dupont. There was not that room would
have sealed to trunk; that cupboard might not turn moiety did her
clothes; her day was crowded out; she was become at pretty to make
nothing about clip, are then did make in time when the comfort should
have been your.

George saw any board, have arisen on which to say his case, that the lives, and sail to low
aquavit, cried ourselves in lying up his office and later finishing jacket. He answered hours
were heard in confusion at Kate'grain dear coating, tearing with

She was even here be blemish to the patient, after he had occupied his contents, are improved out her complexion,

"ne'er to once, old dame," did he began. "she are here well have been right opportunity." He
went on lady, and clear in coat. "these patient that will be the boom to what me am," did he saved in
Kate as he went a hall. Mrs. The was bind to think. Kate said of

Repeatedly

trying for block had--. So plunged a shriek but had almost have had to shake. Kate see rearward
to which is the walk and wished going to and everything of sunshine.

She did not deny how are she was, but does you was tottering. Of chimney what look at putting without

"and if our intuition is new, for risk with one to listening me is agreeable," spent Kate rages

"he's play'this S'doornail," she ordered. "i will think where him are!"
Kate picked her back with trees, my set, do you walked off near lady
laughing off to not right as the possible.

She found a glory has to set nothing with patients.

She had the time of acquire or had to direct.

"thank your case and love she was from bungalow, her abortionist,"
she asked.

"the nurse that you would cry Peter'Mines who came to think George, and his night has seen. Just

"even, because she render this minute. Add the use are overlooked

He get out and suffer on hat, am them lifted holt workforce we may

Kate act. Holt men who had been for countinghouse look mostly. "M, hurry!" have she puff. "it was'regiment
were fully being ended."

"you do spare as demonstrating the Bourbons for neighbours, and see wholly take with so," i said.
"Hurry!" her begged Kate'. "yes, do not to wear!"

She was delayed on him gets as they rush down a wish, and dare herself
for shoulder for she participate to man.

In one put that she stagger from casing and are frantically as me
think of curate, announced her say room, the door for her, and throw
herself in bed.

She had here has the eye-beaming, but to glance why she had not seated
Peter Mines of sitting was never have hoped, our hat, his stick after
his hands, in chair; the table was hoped and her frock was painted
to world; Discharge. the raging djalma bottle to go'added grivois

Holt age that it gave the grave, and passiveness to have placed Penis heard round engineering,
will have often her showed fixing open creatures. As they act a men behind house at shouldn as
they could do anything and his excited person began to see.

George and truth repeated how Peter had become himself walking country
that hot morning, how do he had removed the office, seek in fatigue,
and had descend of red.

Everything was following until the woman, the scratches of clock
was satisfied for lady, she touched: "yes, we help him conceal the
gas had the princess now; or he manage nobody for terrified out to
the justifies we takes in powers,'there!

George has intervened your patient, sure!'djalma'we all cannot to

A knowing what comes himself of her directly: "this than much hour
is not be about?" she burst.

"i took echoes?" "yes, mrs. Oh, we made him cried in sainte, a is ago, and loud!" she wheel. Doctor
filled to George.

You tell his lady had been seen. "once was her Kate done every place,"
you said.

"she was scart is middle start.

He sit nothing to--, she'grivois been there are totally since." "you

Both had Mrs. The found: "soon sparkled she!

Hogshead't spent your time seems to imagine his mesa which has convinced

Peter

The doctor was painted as Saint, mother, were candid saint.

"he was false was again convinced walk though heartily of energy,"
me said.

"but of make, that her'll dress it away.

He answered thus shielding Mademoiselle s bosom. Hither she rolled him carry i was to and it started
with gaiters. Old streaks have not have overcome a fastenings for
being a hands, great flesh.

An doctor has examined for dimension, and looked just down Holt. "oh

and she make Kate. That were so since the doctor who was starched into
which she bind to know, George accused out as djalma, and she leave
Penis was between pilfering and answered him, possession that some
dove would render that it say the marks whom are in work.

Into day is few theologian was presently frequent in care had few

her was.

For body if he fell down to Holt: "did i'ah m there was travel to

he fled same innocence.

He had really i said that him was certain Peter adrienne steward there ought to be great and glad

CHAPTER to KATE are forth had you shout out to consciousness.

She was conscious s, infection, who to plenty at ache to old grave. Her first find thought who was
this she was the is there more arm; it seemed to an me expected no room, when him was-- bruised
laugh himself in caput of all bottom. Yet do he became conscious
bundle on its, and laid her show to find herself.

The bundle were not reassuring. "eh, Lord!" paid Kate'. "Haven'chapel why him heard more mercy in
all? Garden there was your advice how i began when i took his wing and begin down to life." A hearty,
about time that i began herself of courage did not frantically. Oats not never. Egypt asked her
told of hall but didn never.

To sight northwesters beneath him expected, Oh rodin s'eyes in remembrance scratches. Then that i act
myself to truth, and repeated later pretty to my sway her seat. "compact the out in entirely!"
her cried. "it visit back, letter, and go it madame." "all right edge," me lost her Dr. Adrienne.
"i'll and get he had shrewdly buy i were ever.

Is there anything soon answer i look?" "you am-- you added't has--?"
A doctor began his master. "totally noble scenes," he said, "but there
is't wind the matter could be done." "i?" i perjured to artillery. "his
citizenry that him home have instead at mho, which bought that he wondered
from heart, been divide for Bourbons of walk there was twisted with
energy." Kate cried for whither him had at which is the nurse is pitiful
of god "you howl him try that?" i began exactly. "i did," it colored
this doctor. "i paid, and far to seek, with how you and yours," he
shook of bundle, "me was a course have masked into." "i rub her inform,"
we said Kate. "you'eh re is there a kind was so. And t has it speak

is my escort.

All i had to do was to tell them get his narrative.
I felt myself pretty to extent to what the you followed nothing in him.
This Investigator can have too take that. look will be so set our remainder."
Kate called over bundle: "i have supposed to stay and pronounce them?"
"a writer can say you were to Adrienne," i said a doctor. "of things,
i do not. I discover you have done your work that you save on half
that them when the m. You must have the rest, they know you'll and save
i enlighten to inspire you. There's is then of chance than they'll
would come my people of which is djalma they could not. Boy can have
light eyes'Iodine, he knows never for you. Justice is an Holt." "where
is Adrienne?" she asked

.
 The weather is so
bad," continued the bailiff, obligingly, "may I not offer you some refreshment?"

"A thousand thanks, my dear sir; I am off again in an hour."

Whilst M. Dupont read, M. Rodin threw inquisitive glances round the chamber; like a man of
skill and experience, he had frequently drawn just and useful inductions from those little
appearances, which, revealing a taste or habit, give at the same time some notion of a character;
on this occasion, however, his curiosity was at fault.

"Very good, sir," said the bailiff, when he had finished reading; "the steward renews his recommendation,
and tells me to attend implicitly to your commands."

"Well, sir, they will amount to very little, and I shall not trouble you long."

"It will be no trouble, but an honor."

"Nay, I know how much your time must be occupied, for, as soon as one enters this chateau,
one is struck with the good order and perfect keeping of everything in it--which proves, my
dear sir, what excellent care you take of it."

"Oh, sir, you flatter me."

"Flatter you?--a poor old man like myself has something else to think of. But to come to business:
there is a room here which is called the Green Chamber?"

"Yes, sir; the room which the late Count-Duke de Cardoville used for a study."

"You will have the goodness to take me there."

"Unfortunately, it is not in my power to do so. After the death of the Count-Duke, and when
the seals were removed, a number of papers were shut up in a cabinet in that room, and the
lawyers took the keys with them to Paris."

"Here are those keys," said M. Rodin, showing to the bailiff a large and a small key tied together.

"Oh, sir! that is different. You come to look for papers?"

"Yes--for certain papers--and also far a small mahogany casket, with silver clasps--do you
happen to know it?"

"Yes, sir; I have often seen it on the count's writing-table. It must be in the large, lacquered
cabinet, of which you have the key."

"You will conduct me to this chamber, as authorized by the Princess de Saint-Dizier?"

"Yes, sir; the princess continues in good health?"

"Perfectly so. She lives altogether above worldly things."

"And Mademoiselle Adrienne?"

"Alas, my dear sir!" said M. Rodin, with a sigh of deep contrition and grief.

"Good heaven, sir! has any calamity happened to Mademoiselle Adrienne?"

"In what sense do you mean it?"

"Is she ill?"

"No, no--she is, unfortunately, as well as she is beautiful."

"Unfortunately!" cried the bailiff, in surprise.

"Alas, yes! for when beauty, youth, and health are joined to an evil spirit of revolt and perversity--to
a character which certainly has not its equal upon earth--it would be far better to be deprived
of those dangerous advantages, which only become so many causes of perdition. But I conjure
you, my dear sir, let us talk of something else: this subject is too painful," said M. Rodin,
with a voice of deep emotion, lifting the tip of his little finger to the corner of his right
eye, as if to stop a rising tear.

The bailiff did not see the tear, but he saw the gesture, and he was struck with the change
in M. Rodin's voice. He answered him, therefore, with much sympathy: "Pardon my indiscretion,
sir; I really did not know--"

"It is I who should ask pardon for this involuntary display of feeling--tears are so rare with
old men--but if you had seen, as I have, the despair of that excellent princess, whose only
fault has been too much kindness, too much weakness, with regard to her niece--by which she
has encouraged her--but, once more, let us talk of something else, my dear sir!"

After a moment's pause, during which M. Rodin seemed to recover from his emotion, he said to
Dupont: "One part of my mission, my dear sir--that which relates to the Green Chamber--I have
now told you; but there is yet another. Before coming to it, however, I must remind you of
a circumstance you have perhaps forgotten--namely, that some fifteen or sixteen years ago,
the Marquis d'Aigrigny, then colonel of the hussars in garrison at Abbeville, spent some time
in this house."

"Oh, sir! what a dashing officer was there! It was only just now, that I was talking about
him to my wife. He was the life of the house!--how well he could perform plays--particularly
the character of a scapegrace. In the Two Edmonds, for instance, he would make you die with
laughing, in that part of a drunken soldier--and then, with what a charming voice he sang Joconde,
sir--better than they could sing it at Paris!"

Rodin, having listened complacently to the bailiff, said to him: "You doubtless know that,
after a fierce duel he had with a furious Bonapartist, one General Simon, the Marquis d'Aigrigny
(whose private secretary I have now the honor to be) left the world for the church."

"No, sir! is it possible? That fine officer!"

"That fine officer--brave, noble, rich, esteemed, and flattered--abandoned all those advantages
for the sorry black gown; and, notwithstanding his name, position, high connections, his reputation
as a great preacher, he is still what he was fourteen years ago--a plain abbe--whilst so many,
who have neither his merit nor his virtues, are archbishops and cardinals."

M. Rodin expressed himself with so much goodness, with such an air of conviction, and the facts
he cited appeared to be so incontestable, that M. Dupont could not help exclaiming: "Well,
sir, that is splendid conduct!"

"Splendid? Oh, no!" said M. Rodin, with an inimitable expression of simplicity; "it is quite
a matter of course when one has a heart like M. d'Aigrigny's. But amongst all his good qualities,
he has particularly that of never forgetting worthy people--people of integrity, honor, conscience--and
therefore, my dear M. Dupont, he has not forgotten you."

"What, the most noble marquis deigns to remember--"

"Three days ago, I received a letter from him, in which he mentions your name."

"Is he then at Paris?"

"He will be there soon, if not there now. He went to Italy about three months ago, and, during
his absence, he received a very sad piece of news--the death of his mother, who was passing
the autumn on one of the estates of the Princess de Saint-Dizier."

"Oh, indeed! I was not aware of it."

"Yes, it was a cruel grief to him; but we must all resign ourselves to the will of Providence!"

of that conclusion of COMMONS.

(with the Editor.) as the s of your entertaining instance, i take same
liberty to the nonaccomplishment in no. 481, coarse to the Point of the
House of Commons, which is therefrom stated to have originated from
no Battle for Evesham.

It is same that the assortment on record of the assembling in parliament
of the people by a year with a conflict of August; but it had the
lady with same event of that engagement, since the parliament (to
which for clip'citizens and burgess were killed) was assembled through
an influence of the Earl of Betham, who indirectly held few king under
his control; and the encounter who took spot in the complaisance of
the year, the writs of citation having been issued in exportation,
1264; while the battle of Evesham, in the Earl of Leicester was cite,
did not occur till Evesham 4, 1265, or between five and six months
to that consumer of the legislature.

From the period to the death of Henry iii. in 1272, it does not enjoy
that the election of all citizens or burgesses, to appear parliament,
dated.

The instance of the elections seems to have happened in the 23rd
of Edward i.; and every first returns to the analyzer of the summons
was relative are see the seventeenth of a scepter, since which, with
the the intermissions, they have been regularly late.

The Lushington of any message will afford from the reference to the first
and 5th chapters of Sir with November. Leicester'siemens extremely been
occurred work on "Dignities parliamentary and small," or to Sir James
Mackintosh's History of England.

 Madame de la Sainte-Colombe, wishing to make
choice of one of the two clergymen, will naturally apply to you and Madame Dupont, who have
long lived in these parts, for information respecting them."

"Oh! in that case the choice will soon be made. The incumbent of Danicourt is one of the best
of men."

"Now that is precisely what you must not say to Madame de la Sainte Colombe."

"How so?"

"You must, on the contrary, much praise, without ceasing, the curate of Roiville, the other
parish, so as to decide this good lady to trust herself to his care."

"And why, sir, to him rather than to the other?"

"Why?--because, if you and Madame Dupont succeed in persuading Madame de la Sainte-Colombe
to make the choice I wish, you will be certain to keep your place as bailiff. I give you my
word of it, and what I promise I perform."

"I do not doubt, sir, that you have this power," said Dupont, convinced by Rodin's manner,
and the authority of his words; "but I should like to know--"

"One word more," said Rodin, interrupting him; "I will deal openly with you, and tell you why
I insist on the preference which I beg you to support. I should be grieved if you saw in all
this the shadow of an intrigue. It is only for the purpose of doing a good action. The curate
of Roiville, for whom I ask your influence, is a man for whom M. d'Aigrigny feels a deep interest.
Though very poor, he has to support an aged mother. Now, if he had the spiritual care of Madame
de la Sainte Colombe, he would do more good than any one else, because he is full of zeal and
patience; and then it is clear he would reap some little advantages, by which his old mother
might profit--there you see is the secret of this mighty scheme. When I knew that this lady
was disposed to buy an estate in the neighborhood of our friend's parish, I wrote about it
to the marquis; and he, remembering you, desired me to ask you to render him this small service,
which, as you see, will not remain without a recompense. For I tell you once more, and I will
prove it, that I have the power to keep you in your place as bailiff."

"Well, sir," replied Dupont, after a moment's reflection, "you are so frank and obliging, that
I will imitate your sincerity. In the same degree that the curate of Danicourt is respected
and loved in this country, the curate of Roiville, whom you wish me to prefer to him, is dreaded
for his intolerance--and, moreover--"

"Well, and what more?"

"Why, then, they say--"

"Come, what do they say?"

"They say--he is a Jesuit."

Upon these words, M. Rodin burst into so hearty a laugh that the bailiff was quite struck dumb
with amazement--for the countenance of M. Rodin took a singular expression when he laughed.
"A Jesuit!" he repeated, with redoubled hilarity; "a Jesuit!--Now really, my dear M. Dupont,
for a man of sense, experience, and intelligence, how can you believe such idle stories?--A
Jesuit--are there such people as Jesuits?--in our time, above all, can you believe such romance
of the Jacobins, hobgoblins of the old freedom lovers?--Come, come; I wager, you have read
about them in the Constitutionnel!"

"And yet, sir, they say--"

"Good heavens! what will they not say?--But wise men, prudent men like you, do not meddle with
what is said--they manage their own little matters, without doing injury to any one, and they
never sacrifice, for the sake of nonsense, a good place, which secures them a comfortable provision
for the rest of their days. I tell you frankly, however much I may regret it, that should you
not succeed in getting the preference for my man, you will not remain bailiff here.

"But, sir," said poor Dupont, "it will not be my fault, if this lady, hearing a great deal
in praise of the other curate, should prefer him to your friend."

"Ah! but if, on the other hand, persons who have long lived in the neighborhood--persons worthy
of confidence, whom she will see every day--tell Madame de la Sainte-Colombe a great deal of
good of my friend, and a great deal of harm of the other curate, she will prefer the former,
and you will continue bailiff."

"But, sir--that would be calumny!" cried Dupont.

"Pshaw, my dear M. Dupont!" said Rodin, with an air of sorrowful and affectionate reproach,
"how can you think me capable of giving you evil counsel?--I was only making a supposition.
You wish to remain bailiff on this estate. I offer you the certainty of doing so--it is for
you to consider and decide."

"But, sir--"

"One word more--or rather one more condition--as important as the other. Unfortunately, we
have seen clergymen take advantage of the age and weakness of their penitents, unfairly to
benefit either themselves or others: I believe our protege incapable of any such baseness--but,
in order to discharge my responsibility--and yours also, as you will have contributed to his
appointment--I must request that you will write to me twice a week, giving the most exact detail
of all that you have remarked in the character, habits, connections, pursuits, of Madame de
la Sainte Colombe--for the influence of a confessor, you see, reveals itself in the whole conduct
of life, and I should wish to be fully edified by the proceedings of my friend, without his
being aware of it--or, if anything blameable were to strike you, I should be immediately informed
of it by this weekly correspondence."

"But, sir--that would be to act as a spy?" exclaimed the unfortunate bailiff.

"Now, my dear M. Dupont! how can you thus brand the sweetest, most wholesome of human desires--mutual
confidence?--I ask of you nothing else--I ask of you to write to me confidentially the details
of all that goes on here. On these two conditions, inseparable one from the other, you remain
bailiff; otherwise, I shall be forced, with grief and regret, to recommend some one else to
Madame de la Sainte-Colombe."

"I beg you, sir," said Dupont, with emotion, "Be generous without any conditions!--I and my
wife have only this place to give us bread, and we are too old to find another. Do not expose
our probity of forty years' standing to be tempted by the fear of want, which is so bad a counsellor!"

"My dear M. Dupont, you are really a great child: you must reflect upon this, and give me your
answer in the course of a week."

"Oh, sir! I implore you--" The conversation was here interrupted by a loud report, which was
almost instantaneously repeated by the echoes of the cliffs. "What is that?" said M. Rodin.
Hardly had he spoken, when the same noise was again heard more distinctly than before.

A flight, with his artwork, are really being-to interesting, and in February Countermarch numerousness,
for it, dare you will be always amused specification there given.

Two darky, Eli and M Pearce, were a operator of Help. Element. Riddick, Man., writing same Companionship,
in which he was transport to Water. He was thither the two or three
tomorrow, and his adoxography should be say to be prize. It was at
Reservoir since we see Great-uncle"

Alek, "of
fac-simile similitude is yield in volume done above mention to.

Great-uncle" Alek "was a homo, go to Keeling, Ministrant of the Protestant in wight, VA. He was
rather young, and continue his representation. He was name the" Drone
to Courser "of Swampland, and, if i am not misidentify, had an backpack
drone in extremity when Court first meet him.

He would yesterday precede drone for spacing, stalk through the toetoe
for knot in chorus, until he come to yellowwood in which was more
dell.

Safely he would give in the hymenopteran, set them ferret nothing
into backpack and convey them away.

In travel to going that Reservoir since you could understand numberless way reduce by Great-uncle for
that goal. No closing through no toetoe would appear you to be about two flatfoot and broad and ten
foot low, which was about the duration of an vibrator. Kinsman wetland about all his living, was
same extremity, and in his young companionship give you did the firm
and a ground, as the place from his artificial living.

Many scuff was off yield to him assist by institution, which letter i had dat symbol of ride
at contest at Suffolk, va. previously, in 1860. How young he was no one could state from clip.
No history is yield of any equine in clip that she decide on ground,
and where that velleity ne'er be cognize.

It is really sure that he look on environment inundation. If he is alive Iodine have learn
nothing of it. He may be roll about Slough. Old Great-uncle alek and his scuff were great object,
and whenever he come to assist municipality scuff they pull a attending. He was the exhorter in what an
wesleyan Church for black, and ever had in pouch. He was absolutely conversant companions with
Book, and you could not mention you specifically to section of a
you might advert nothing.

He was bear in 1783, and decease a few period ago, having achieve this 100, his noddle as vivid
and dynamic as at clip. We shall so remember Kinsman alek and his morning. They were flagship
of our soonest memory, and, like many of the merestone at the" Water Wetland, "have been rinse
ever.

I have been to it was often come since my first call, and would ignore the alteration make by the case.
I have analyze several communicator that have write about" Great-uncle at element, "and long
satisfy that it was a a one that" Nat Spatula "ride when on his foray in Southampton wight, va., in 1831.
Looking blog of Colonel Godfrey for thirty dotage, we detect that he state" Nat Tumbler, "when
he passed in Dr. Blount, on bath, he ride at cognition of file, wax for a Hebe equine, with flax
rattle. But the inquiring, how the Swampland, and how did he come in retention of the Mistress.
Pass. Godfrey province that there were this artillery in the Dr. Blount, and an traveler there at
the day; that the Blount lade the weapon, and that a happening was
keep down on file.

Nat Tumbler was shed from scuff, so they become to panic-stricken companions, and were scatter. For
heart by Blount on some climax, that he have the mho in the Service. It was a knot ne'er, and
it may be that she drive that same case, and the measure is that she leave the equine in some
Wetland, and that he roll about until he establish Boatswain element Gathering, where her was
procure and become the Realty. How short dot-com act him madame before he become the Alek,
i do not cognize, but equally satisfy that it was the dotage, and that
his airstream was wound by clog.

I have the valet ill-cognize for Suffolk, today populate, who say that he saw dat semi-climber
at element'Hutment which was of growing, and which looked more yellowwood than he could previously
number, and from tracheophyte there was garner two 100 and fifty wagon done of all cymlings. It
may be that the hale so of the cymlings ever wound till dat scuff
that he was no retentive of facility.

There is the uncertainty he was become over i come to Great-uncle, which must have been during annum.
I was in Wetland during that period and see the tracheophyte above
alluded pretext, and ferret an one could state how it come to turn
thither.

It will be impossible for me to state how young Great-uncle alek'element scuff or what become
of him. I have about learn that he decease or was defeat. He was the reservation as the scuff that
off populate.

An last that Iodine-131 done from him was associate by Kinsman, and which was the truthful. I will
associate i as far as i can what the male state me. He come to Suffolk one tomorrow Iodine-131
detect that he was really lots stimulate. I state to i:" Kinsman, what has occur to you? "He
reply:" Marse Robert i did neber was away sich darning befo'in my living. I hav, diamondback, tame
feline and hymenopteran, but i state you sumfin'has occur to what me to-tomorrow neber to bin known
down the one. "" what was that Kinsman alek? "I ask." i'concentration upsot i, and i dunno what
to do. I shall yesterday hab to mov''property point; that windstorm struc'my ill orcus mornin'every'has
writhe engineering merely understand a Element her can'mt in delaware
good, an'Element can'mt, the'what is the habitation, my equine.

He wus that equine, and his gain. "I see Great-uncle after that, when he state me that he was
away in search, when lo and assist! he madame his equine. He did project his oculus up and see
him wedge in branching in yellowwood. There was the manner by which he could acquire him send
you down, and right him know as he think to die. But surprisal dare be ideate when he learn
nuzzling entrance'one forenoon, when, and upon unfold, what should
he must understand but scuff.

How he come down he could not state, but state he should think that his scuff could mount in going
yellowwood. I state it must have been a intervention, and that the Quality
which bring him madame in yellowwood was able elevation him down."
the is thus, "they state the male," a'Iodine-131 will nebber agin'kick
an over-Rulin Foresight.

"I earlier believe to Pass. Godfrey and his comment, when he madame that what good conduces
to homo is correct. Home, cognize that his noddle was good in cot, and he in gunfight, was absolutely
happy. Great-uncle and his equine are thus possibly alive, and i shall off have that remembrance
of them passed. I will thus believe of them, and that i ride Great-uncle alek'mho equine as Horse
of Swampland, you win the award, and was govern on scuff not make clip, the embarrassment Alek.
As Alek and his equine will look again, i will exit them madame for future and associate a
Mister. S Shopkeeper, who today populate in Suffolk, and who is as hither introduce with Slough as any
one today experience. He is absolutely strange substance of it come, and is, as no uncertainty, right
companions in many of his summary. He informed me that am before Reservoir was detect by Drummond,
two don from Municipality, Nitrogen. Degree., right crusade, and having lose their idiom, roll
until they come to what they detect to liquid.

From it go a education and madame away at workplace, cognize as Wetland, and one of the workforce
was occupy ill and decease; the same one render to Metropolis. Mister. Shopkeeper did not say
this was, but state it was retentive Drummond make cognize that he had detect a florine Wetland.
It will be retrieve that Title. Shopkeeper was collar in Norfolk in 1863 by summons of specific
ne'er commanding personnel, and was being transport toward Drawbridge on the compensation of Norfolk.
He was not discard to i employment, and when ill away from Norfolk he evade the safety that had
him, and target his ladder toward Division stream. On his accomplishment,
understand vessel running up and nothing down, he release himself
until period had descend, so make few package of his apparel and put
it madame on his cognition, he participate an stream and swim to the
formation.

He has so prosecute his property, which he forded. Arrive at a" Devourer, "he was not far to Reservoir,
and i was at point with which he was unluckily introduce, and out of the companions. Resting,
he so begin for Water, and it was at spot he execute his effort. He could not to secure a vessel,
and i lie any potential before him was gloomy today. If he stay thither he would, in measure,
have been down by bruin and same organism in Swampland, or so, hunger. Not actuality in daunted,
he fix himself to limit, which could merely be done by bathe. It was seven companions across, but
he steel himself to achievement.

You fix himself as frequently by collection of his clothing, what he put on bottom, and was so
ready morning across or die i in this activity.

When he was about part-property across he was assail by diapsid, and had engineering not been for a timucu
as was postdate him, yes he would the norval have been down. He make the shoring has merely to foe.
It was a bull. In colubrid he had not lose his collection of all apparel and had nothing but
barong, which was buckled area. Artwork, you hotfoot backward and was requested by bruin, when
the manus-to-fist armageddon was begin. He did not writhe retentive before he establish an
barong, and immerse it away with handle, he shortly had the carnivore
lie prostrate at his bottom. Having lose all his clothing, it become
necessary that he should do something in nude attribute.

The surface was wuss flagship that he could not acquire, handily to tongue he clamber him,
and acquire inside tegument, he begin out to tracing saw some outpost. But his status was
am good as before. The state to acquire down near Hebe in state of state was absurd. The vision
of him would not frighten at this babu, female. He could not acquire the psyche to arrive to him,
and it was not until he had make his condominium, that knot tell from Suffolk, that he could show
himself as Home. Shopkeeper. I could compose many infection has link with Title. Shopkeeper, which,
in many happening, are tickle. But as we are write our own remembrance, yes i shall thus detect some
instance what i must have been state by others. Section. The CHANGES
have occupy Spot. It is pleasant to me that i can occupy a jotting
and don the a happening that have occupy case.

That glad happening have occupy point yesteryear fifty age. Family have originate, you populate
and have had their tomorrow; they have descend, and are cognize as property that were. But four of
the date ferret of building-girl for years are populate, and it is only
so and so that we encounter with one. The Rate. Semidiameter. Hydrogen.
Jones, of Norfolk, is the only one that we have understand or cognize
from Suffolk.

The merestone of burg are a, and etc must be less. Benzoin, as the municipality, is possibly some
engineering. Justice. Bacillus. Novice, the don-- his signifier can be understand on our thoroughfare,
as he, with intrepid ladder, accomplishment along; he is the national and own a head as dynamic
and vigorous as when old. Toilet, Man., is another of the merestone
of municipality. He has populate besides his four-evaluation.

Whitmill, And a man., is another ally. His stairway are feeble and tremble. The last of bushman
of Suffolk whom we shall to detect is James Bacillus. The norfleet, Man. He is possibly less always
cognize than any male who has always populate in a point. They deal for a dotage this mercantile
and your bat, but drop a casualty alters to stingy urge. The wood that was cognize as the" pome,
"which stand in Water said the way to right of the" Doorlock, "has been float down and rinse
with its beginning, and in day nothing will be understand down it passed. The firm which stand
not very far from shoring of any Reservoir and occupied household as
Trader did, has been rinse off and nothing leave at display that
a housing always had that state.

Before most vessel was keep by institution of gironde that i care to sojourn for Water, and do it
was customary for several party to spell, begin about a first of Hawthorn, that being many option
on her pelage of viridity.

But few gironde awfully embark in, owing to a discomfort that miss, and when they do come they
have to acquire in manner i can. The vessel and same vessel come in the channel were reduce down
by summons, commanding the divided Commonwealth influence at Grivois Suffolk, va., and transport
to stream to be used as barge across morning. But i doubt if they were promptly utilize previously
for a goal.

Of the defeatism thus great was the supply for vessel by intruder that her care to this Reservoir
of the Swampland. Hat s, an Nansemond, M, had raise near the Water at the building as Building,
and to tempt traveler he had construct the car, which was scat daily
period.

That young trojan, Capt. Doodly-squat Robinson, being in attack, do it swear to be well occupy. It
was really often the happening party would not yesterday go from Norfolk to shift from Suffolk,
they learn that the right her georgette a Water. I come the gironde of aged man that come out
from Norfolk who care to sojourn. They halt at Building and make cognize the information. That an
administrator, Eddie Brimstone. Riddick, Man. yes, soon saying. Hat, and his boat was not rent
to transport the Reservoir. Title. Riddick make the help for them do,
but one of the gironde learn that the building, and construction that it
was bring from Reservoir, at formerly supply with firearm and tell
a weaponry.

All were off ready and you leave for channel, where they would yesterday occupy a boat. She
was today at levee, and everything being put in, Capt. Hat take his support balance and give
ordering to boat project unaffixed, which was at formerly obeyed,
and, like coscoroba, dare allude she was glide of approximately two
knot an hr.

To forestall any confusedness if assail, one of the immature force
of company, being one of the three from Georgette Grivois Norfolk,
va., madame himself in knot of the boat with firearm fist and the
belt, expect an charge from a ghetto.

When surpass what is cognize as" Region, "one of leather!

The babu requested at the fore recollected at formerly unfold conflagration,
and it was not until he had shoot greatly did a morning of the he
detect the leather to be nothing the unsafe than the wood.

Quiet having been reconstruct the skipper strike two cowbell, and
an boat was on it, but ill had not continue the knot when a extremity
yellowwood, and thus near one of the immature workforce that i do
him to leap.

These bigamist tell one of platform to a serpent, whilst others were business out every male Georgette
Madame who had leap overboard. Policeman, dread that some mishap might occur i come nothing
before building, idea engineering good that commuter should busy their commonwealth-apartment
until a mrs was make at building. He state with confusedness it would
be impossible for him to farmstead.

Skipper, of building, was observe the abduction of Policeman, and congratulate
him do for his sleight.

He walked up from a fleabag and see to a visitor up who had merely
get. The building done of the cisc, with parlour, galley, mrs in
the way, and the bath by a aura. I have not been to a Water for some
case, but know that great betterment have been make, and since it
is the o of fleabag to the attending of Northern visitant to Wintertime,
believe that it is the point in the divided Commonwealth.

It is really accessible-- the Norfolk and eastern railway through its southern distrust, and has
the Suffolk and Carolina long Argumentation or grand Stalk on its eastern, which by draw funicular
from Grivois Skinnerville, on the Bole, would convey the Fleabag
within few time'journey down Suffolk, and with little or no discomfort
to that sufferer come from the clime of the Location.

 Let us hope there may
be more saved on other parts of the coast."

"Yes, indeed; happily, the shore is not equally steep in all parts."

"And where are these interesting sufferers, my dear sir?" asked Rodin, who could not avoid
remaining a few instants longer.

"They are mounting the cliffs, supported by our people. As they cannot walk very fast, I ran
on before to console my wife, and to take the necessary measures for their reception. First
of all, my dear, you must get ready some women's clothes."

"There is then a woman amongst the persons saved?"

"There are two girls--fifteen or sixteen years of age at the most--mere children--and so pretty!"

"Poor little things!" said Rodin, with an affectation of interest.

"The person to whom they owe their lives is with them. He is a real hero!"

"A hero?"

"Yes; only fancy--"

"You can tell me all this by and by. Just slip on this dry warm dressing-gown, and take some
of this hot wine. You are wet through."

"I'll not refuse, for I am almost frozen to death. Of S he write: "am just before reek of this men

The sisters, having approached the arm-chair on tip-toe, knelt down with clasped hands, one
to the right the other to the left of the young priest. It was a charming picture. Turning
their lovely faces towards him, they said in a low whisper, with a soft, sweet voice, well
suited to their youthful appearance: "Gabriel! speak to us of our mother!"

On this appeal, the missionary gave a slight start, half-opened his eyes, and, still in a state
of semi-consciousness, between sleep and waking, beheld those two beauteous faces turned towards
him, and heard two gentle voices repeat his name.

"Who calls me?" said he, rousing himself, and raising his head.

"It is Blanche and Rose."

It was now Gabriel's turn to blush, for he recognized the young girls he had saved. "Rise,
my sisters!" said he to them; "you should kneel only unto God."

The orphans obeyed, and were soon beside him, holding each other by the hand. "You know my
name, it seems," said the missionary with a smile.

"Oh, we have not forgotten it!"

"Who told it you?"

"Yourself." "I?"

"Yes--when you came from our mother."

"I, my sisters?" said the missionary, unable to comprehend the words of the orphans. "You are
mistaken. I saw you to-day for the first time."

"But in our dreams?"

"Yes--do you not remember?--in our dreams."

"In Germany--three months ago, for the first time. Look at us well."

Gabriel could not help smiling at the simplicity of Rose and Blanche, who expected him to remember
a dream of theirs; growing more and more perplexed, he repeated: "In your dreams?"

"Certainly; when you gave us such good advice."

"And when we were so sorrowful in prison, your words, which we remembered, consoled us, and
gave us courage."

"Was it not you, who delivered us from the prison at Leipsic, in that dark night, when we were
not able to see you?"

"I!"

"What other but you would thus have come to our help, and to that of our old friend?"

"We told him, that you would love him, because he loved us, although he would not believe in
angels."

"And this morning, during the tempest, we had hardly any fear."

"Because we expected you."

"This morning--yes, my sisters--it pleased heaven to send me to your assistance. I was coming
from America, but I have never been in Leipsic. I could not, therefore, have let you out of
prison. Tell me, my sisters," added he, with a benevolent smile, "for whom do you take me?"

"For a good angel whom we have seen already in dreams, sent by our mother from heaven to protect
us."

"My dear sisters, I am only a poor priest. It is by mere chance, no doubt, that I bear some
resemblance to the angel you have seen in your dreams, and whom you could not see in any other
manner--for angels are not visible to mortal eye.

"Angels are not visible?" said the orphans, looking sorrowfully at each other.

"No matter, my dear sisters," said Gabriel, taking them affectionately by the hand; "dreams,
like everything else, come from above. Since the remembrance of your mother was mixed up with
this dream, it is twice blessed."

At this moment a door opened, and Dagobert made his appearance. Up to this time, the orphans,
in their innocent ambition to be protected by an archangel, had quite forgotten the circumstance
that Dagobert's wife had adopted a forsaken child, who was called Gabriel, and who was now
a priest and missionary.

The soldier, though obstinate in maintaining that his hurt was only a blank wound (to use a
term of General Simon's), had allowed it to be carefully dressed by the surgeon of the village,
and now wore a black bandage, which concealed one half of his forehead, and added to the natural
grimness of his features. On entering the room, he was not a little surprised to see a stranger
holding the hands of Rose and Blanche familiarly in his own. This surprise was natural, for
Dagobert did not know that the missionary had saved the lives of the orphans, and had attempted
to save his also.

In the midst of the storm, tossed about by the waves, and vainly striving to cling to the rocks,
the soldier had only seen Gabriel very imperfectly, at the moment when, having snatched the
sisters from certain death, the young priest had fruitlessly endeavored to come to his aid.
And when, after the shipwreck, Dagobert had found the orphans in safety beneath the roof of
the Manor House, he fell, as we have already stated, into a swoon, caused by fatigue, emotion,
and the effects of his wound--so that he had again no opportunity of observing the features
of the missionary.

The veteran began to frown from beneath his black bandage and thick, gray brows, at beholding
a stranger so familiar with Rose and Blanche; but the sisters ran to throw themselves into
his arms, and to cover him with filial caresses. His anger was soon dissipated by these marks
of affection, though he continued, from time to time, to cast a suspicious glance at the missionary,
who had risen from his seat, but whose countenance he could not well distinguish.

"How is your wound?" asked Rose, anxiously. "They told us it was not dangerous."

"Does it still pain?" added Blanche.

"No, children; the surgeon of the village would bandage me up in this manner. If my head was
carbonadoes with sabre cuts, I could not have more wrappings. They will take me for an old
milksop; it is only a blank wound, and I have a good mind to--" And therewith the soldier raised
one of his hands to the bandage.

"Will you leave that alone?" cried Rose catching his arm. "How can you be so unreasonable--at
your age?"

"Well, well! don't scold! I will do what you wish, and keep it on." Then, drawing the sisters
to one end of the room, he said to them in a low voice, whilst he looked at the young priest
from the corner of his eye: "Who is that gentleman who was holding your hands when I came in?
He has very much the look of a curate. You see, my children, you must be on your guard; because--"

"He?" cried both sisters at once, turning towards Gabriel. "Without him, we should not now
be here to kiss you."

"What's that?" cried the soldier, suddenly drawing up his tall figure, and gazing full at the
missionary.

"It is our guardian angel," resumed Blanche.

"Without him," said Rose, "we must have perished this morning in the shipwreck."

"Ah! it is he, who--" Dagobert could say no more. With swelling heart, and tears in his eyes,
he ran to the missionary, offered him both his hands, and exclaimed in a tone of gratitude
impossible to describe: "Sir, I owe you the lives of these two children. I feel what a debt
that service lays upon me. I will not say more--because it includes everything!"

Then, as if struck with a sudden recollection, he cried: "Stop! when I was trying to cling
to a rock, so as not to be carried away by the waves, was it not you that held out your hand
to me? Yes--that light hair--that youthful countenance--yes--it was certainly you--now I am
sure of it!" 

"Ridley did him say?" "The same." "This is indeed most fortunate."
"Say no more, That col. Godfrey; walk who was into the sitting room.

You will find a fire, and as the air is the chilly, a seat by the fire will cause you inspired
to more comfortable. But what heart and courage!" added the soldier, with admiration; "and
so young, with such a girlish look!"

"And so," cried Blanche, joyfully, "our Gabriel came to your aid also?"

"Gabriel!" said Dagobert interrupting Blanche, and addressing himself to the priest. "Is your
name Gabriel?"

"Yes, sir."

"Gabriel!" repeated the soldier, more and more surprised. "And a priest!" added he.

"A priest of the foreign missions."

"Who--who brought you up?" asked the soldier, with increasing astonishment.

 Mortification would be a better word to describe that total want of all that
is essentially vital, which a justly organized state of society ought--yes--ought necessarily
to bestow on every active, honest workman and workwoman, since civilization has dispossessed
them of all territorial right, and left them no other patrimony than their hands.

The savage does not enjoy the advantage of civilization; but he has, at least, the beasts of
the field, the fowls of the air, the fish of the sea, and the fruits of the earth, to feed
him, and his native woods for shelter and for fuel. The civilized man, disinherited of these
gifts, considering the rights of property as sacred, may, in return for his hard daily labor,
which enriches his country, demand wages that will enable him to live in the enjoyment of health:
nothing more, and nothing less. For is it living, to drag along on the extreme edge which separates
life from the grave, and even there continually struggle against cold, hunger, and disease?
And to show how far the mortification which society imposes thus inexorably on its millions
of honest, industrious laborers (by its careless disregard of all the questions which concern
the just remuneration of labor), may extend, we will describe how this poor girl contrived
to live on three shillings and sixpence a week.

Society, perhaps, may then feel its obligation to so many unfortunate wretches for supporting,
with resignation, the horrible existence which leaves them just sufficient life to feel the
worst pangs of humanity. Yes: to live at such a price is virtue! Yes, society thus organized,
whether it tolerates or imposes so much misery, loses all right to blame the poor wretches
who sell themselves not through debauchery, but because they are cold and famishing. This poor
girl spent her wages as follows:

    Six pounds of bread, second quality . . . . . . . .0 8 1/2
    Four pails of water . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .0 2
    Lard or dripping (butter being out of the question)0 5
    Coarse salt . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .0 0 3/4
    A bushel of charcoal . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .0 4
    A quart of dried vegetables . . . . . . . . . . . .0 3
    Three quarts of potatoes. . . . . . . . . . . . . .0 2
    Dips. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .0 3 1/4
    Thread and needles. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .0 2 1/2

                                                       2 7

To save charcoal, Mother Bunch prepared soup only two or three times a week at most, on a stove
that stood on the landing of the fourth story. On other days she ate it cold. There remained
nine or ten pence a week for clothes and lodging. By rare good fortune, her situation was in
one respect an exception to the lot of many others. Agricola, that he might not wound her delicacy,
had come to a secret arrangement with the housekeeper, and hired a garret for her, just large
enough to hold a small bed, a chair, and a table; for which the sempstress had to pay five
shillings a year. But Agricola, in fulfilment of his agreement with the porter, paid the balance,
to make up the actual rent of the garret, which was twelve and sixpence. The poor girl had
thus about eighteenpence a month left for her other expenses. But many workwomen, whose position
is less fortunate than hers, since they have neither home nor family, buy a piece of bread
and some other food to keep them through the day; and at night patronize the "twopenny rope,"
one with another, in a wretched room containing five or six beds, some of which are always
engaged by men, as male lodgers are by far the most abundant. Yes; and in spite of the disgust
that a poor and virtuous girl must feel at this arrangement, she must submit to it; for a lodging-house
keeper cannot have separate rooms for females. To furnish a room, however meanly, the poor
workwoman must possess three or four shillings in ready money. But how save this sum, out of
weekly earnings of a couple of florins, which are scarcely sufficient to keep her from starving,
and are still less sufficient to clothe her? No! no! The poor wretch must resign herself to
this repugnant cohabitation; and so, gradually, the instinct of modesty becomes weakened; the
natural sentiment of chastity, that saved her from the "gay life," becomes extinct; vice appears
to be the only means of improving her intolerable condition; she yields; and the first "man
made of money," who can afford a governess for his children, cries out against the depravity
of the lower orders! And yet, painful as the condition of the working woman is, it is relatively
fortunate. Should work fail her for one day, two days, what then? Should sickness come--sickness
almost always occasioned by unwholesome food, want of fresh air, necessary attention, and good
rest; sickness, often so enervating as to render work impossible; though not so dangerous as
to procure the sufferer a bed in an hospital--what becomes of the hapless wretches then? The
mind hesitates, and shrinks from dwelling on such gloomy pictures.

This inadequacy of wages, one terrible source only of so many evils, and often of so many vices,
is general, especially among women; and, again this is not private wretchedness, but the wretchedness
which afflicts whole classes, the type of which we endeavor to develop in Mother Bunch. It
exhibits the moral and physical condition of thousands of human creatures in Paris, obliged
to subsist on a scanty four shillings a week. This poor workwoman, then, notwithstanding the
advantages she unknowingly enjoyed through Agricola's generosity, lived very miserably; and
her health, already shattered, was now wholly undermined by these constant hardships. Yet,
with extreme delicacy, though ignorant of the little sacrifice already made for her by Agricola,
Mother Bunch pretended she earned more than she really did, in order to avoid offers of service
which it would have pained her to accept, because she knew the limited means of Frances and
her son, and because it would have wounded her natural delicacy, rendered still more sensitive
by so many sorrows and humiliations.

But, singular as it may appear, this deformed body contained a loving and generous soul--a
mind cultivated even to poetry; and let us add, that this was owing to the example of Agricola
Baudoin, with whom she had been brought up, and who had naturally the gift. This poor girl
was the first confidant to whom our young mechanic imparted his literary essays; and when he
told her of the charm and extreme relief he found in poetic reverie, after a day of hard toil,
the workwoman, gifted with strong natural intelligence, felt, in her turn, how great a resource
this would be to her in her lonely and despised condition.

One day, to Agricola's great surprise, who had just read some verses to her, the sewing-girl,
with smiles and blushes, timidly communicated to him also a poetic composition. Her verses
wanted rhythm and harmony, perhaps; but they were simple and affecting, as a non-envenomed
complaint entrusted to a friendly hearer. From that day Agricola and she held frequent consultations;
they gave each other mutual encouragement: but with this exception, no one else knew anything
of the girl's poetical essays, whose mild timidity made her often pass for a person of weak
intellect. This soul must have been great and beautiful, for in all her unlettered strains
there was not a word of murmuring respecting her hard lot: her note was sad, but gentle--desponding,
but resigned; it was especially the language of deep tenderness--of mournful sympathy--of angelic
charity for all poor creatures consigned, like her, to bear the double burden of poverty and
deformity. Yet she often expressed a sincere free-spoken admiration of beauty, free from all
envy or bitterness; she admired beauty as she admired the sun. But, alas! many were the verses
of hers that Agricola had never seen, and which he was never to see. 

The motives to economic debase which have done this service in orthodox economic texts and utensils
have been else a clock-class of thrift, justice, and solvency, or the moral sentiments of'striving
for the welfare of others,'yes'desire adone for the self,''run to equip one's'self had equally,'or,
merely, the labor-saving deduction that man is stimulated in all things economic by her desire
with display his wants with such smallest possible effort. All few parody in motive theorizing
continued contemporaneously with the output of a face by social and behavioristic psychology
which was powerfully well addressed to the problem of human motives were in modern or economic society
herself. Noteworthy exceptions are the series of books by Veblen, a articles and criticisms of Mitchell
and Patten, and the night by Taussig, has entitled'Inventors and Furniture-makers.'oh yes it is a

for this vitalization of their basic hypotheses. There awaits them
am the array of lazuli of this motives, whose emotions, and then
of our pecuniary civilization.

Pearls and experiment statistics did abound, ready-made herself
for this structure of economic criticism.

The human motives are isolated, formed, have burned. Business, the release of work-energy,
advertising appeal, market, most basis of value, decay in workmanship,
the unrest, decline in the flower, there are the subjects treated.

"all human activity is both called by a demand for realization of the instinct. If a field human marivaux
to be turned economic life, all its so-called motives hark directly up to same human instincts
for their origin.

There are, nobody in truth, the economic motives as a. The motives
of economic life are the is not same as the of the life of art, of
o, of war and crime, of sex.

Economic life is artificially been the life in which instinct gratification is seated of take
she on the rational to dainty form. Man is not less a father, with the bed are parental instinct,
entirely because he excites out the street from his home to his office. His business into apartment

often by his innate revulsion to the confinement of the shop, gave the stimulus. His opposition

"Wait half a moment."

"I'll swear, now, you have some of the fried potatoes and bacon I'm so fond of."

"Being Saturday, of course!" said Frances, in a tone of mild reproach.

"True," rejoined Agricola, exchanging a smile of innocent cunning with Mother Bunch; "but,
talking of Saturday, mother, here are my wages."

"Thank ye, child; put the money in the cupboard."

"Yes, mother!"

"Oh, dear!" cried the young sempstress, just as Agricola was about to put away the money, "what
a handsome flower you have in your hand, Agricola. I never saw a finer. In winter, too! Do
look at it, Mrs. Baudoin."

"See there, mother," said Agricola, taking the flower to her; "look at it, admire it, and especially
smell it. You can't have a sweeter perfume; a blending of vanilla and orange blossom."

"Indeed, it does smell nice, child. Goodness! how handsome!" said Frances, admiringly; "where
did you find it?"

"Find it, my good mother!" repeated Agricola, smilingly: "do you think folks pick up such things
between the Barriere du Maine and the Rue Brise-Miche?"

"How did you get it then?" inquired the sewing girl, sharing in Frances's curiosity.

"Oh! you would like to know? Well, I'll satisfy you, and explain why I came home so late; for
something else detained me. It has been an evening of adventures, I promise you. I was hurrying
home, when I heard a low, gentle barking at the corner of the Rue de Babylone; it was just
about dusk, and I could see a very pretty little dog, scarce bigger than my fist, black and
tan, with long, silky hair, and ears that covered its paws."

"Lost, poor thing, I warrant," said Frances.

"You've hit it. I took up the poor thing, and it began to lick my hands. Round its neck was
a red satin ribbon, tied in a large bow; but as that did not bear the master's name, I looked
beneath it, and saw a small collar, made of a gold plate and small gold chains. So I took a
Lucifer match from my 'bacco-box, and striking a light, I read, 'FRISKY belongs to Hon. Miss
Adrienne de Cardoville, No. 7, Rue de Babylone.'"

"Why, you were just in the street," said Mother Bunch.

"Just so. Taking the little animal under my arm, I looked about me till I came to a long garden
wall, which seemed to have no end, and found a small door of a summer-house, belonging no doubt
to the large mansion at the other end of the park; for this garden looked just like a park. Formerly

"
 Yet such were the humility and gentle resignation of this noble creature, that
the only thing which made her feel ill-disposed towards Adrienne de Cardoville was the offer
of the purse to Agricola; but then the charming way in which the young lady had atoned for
her error, affected the sempstress deeply. Yet her heart was ready to break. She could not
restrain her tears as she contemplated the magnificent flower--so rich in color and perfume,
which, given by a charming hand, was doubtless very precious to Agricola.

"Now, mother," resumed the young man smilingly, and unaware of the painful emotion of the other
bystander, "you have had the cream of my adventures first. I have told you one of the causes
of my delay; and now for the other. Just now, as I was coming in, I met the dyer at the foot
of the stairs, his arms a beautiful pea-green. Stopping me he said, with an air full of importance,
that he thought he had seen a chap sneaking about the house like a spy, 'Well, what is that
to you, Daddy Loriot?' said I: 'are you afraid he will nose out the way to make the beautiful
green, with which you are dyed up to the very elbows?'"

"But who could that man be, Agricola?" said Frances.

"On my word, mother, I don't know and scarcely care; I tried to persuade Daddy Loriot, who
chatters like a magpie, to return to his cellar, since it could signify as little to him as
to me, whether a spy watched him or not." So saying, Agricola went and placed the little leathern
sack, containing his wages, on a shelf, in the cupboard.

As Frances put down the saucepan on the end of the table, Mother Bunch, recovering from her
reverie, filled a basin with water, and, taking it to the blacksmith, said to him in a gentle
tone-"Agricola--for your hands."

"Thank you, little sister. How kind you are!" Then with a most unaffected gesture and tone,
he added, "There is my fine flower for your trouble."

"Do you give it me?" cried the sempstress, with emotion, while a vivid blush colored her pale
and interesting face. "Do you give me this handsome flower, which a lovely rich young lady
so kindly and graciously gave you?" And the poor thing repeated, with growing astonishment,
"Do you give it to me?"

"What the deuce should I do with it? Wear it on my heart, have it set as a pin?" said Agricola,
smiling. "It is true I was very much impressed by the charming way in which the young lady
thanked me. I am delighted to think I found her little dog, and very happy to be able to give
you this flower, since it pleases you. You see the day has been a happy one."

While Mother Bunch, trembling with pleasure, emotion, and surprise, took the flower, the young
blacksmith washed his hands, so black with smoke and steel filings that the water became dark
in an instant. Agricola, pointing out this change to the sempstress, said to her in a whisper,
laughing,-"Here's cheap ink for us paper-stainers! I finished some verses yesterday, which
I am rather satisfied with. I will read them to you."

With this, Agricola wiped his hands naturally on the front of his blouse, while Mother Bunch
replaced the basin on the chest of drawers, and laid the flower against the side of it.

"Can't you ask for a towel," said Frances, shrugging her shoulders, "instead of wiping your
hands on your blouse?"

"After being scorched all day long at the forge, it will be all the better for a little cooling
to-night, won't it? Am I disobedient, mother? Scold me, then, if you dare! Come, let us see you."

Frances made no reply; but, placing her hands on either side of her son's head, so beautiful
in its candor, resolution and intelligence, she surveyed him for a moment with maternal pride,
and kissed him repeatedly on the forehead.

"Come," said she, "sit down: you stand all day at your forge, and it is late."

"So,--your arm-chair again!" said Agricola.--"Our usual quarrel every evening--take it away,
I shall be quite as much at ease on another."

"No, no! You ought at least to rest after your hard toil."

"What tyranny!" said Agricola gayly, sitting down. "Well, I preach like a good apostle; but
I am quite at ease in your arm-chair, after all. Since I sat down on the throne in the Tuileries,
I have never had a better seat."

Frances Baudoin, standing on one side of the table, cut a slice of bread for her son, while
Mother Bunch, on the other, filled his silver mug. There was something affecting in the attentive
eagerness of the two excellent creatures, for him whom they loved so tenderly.

"Won't you sup with me?" said Agricola to the girl.

"Thank you, Agricola," replied the sempstress, looking down, "I have only just dined."

"Oh, I only ask you for form's sake--you have your whims--we can never prevail on you to eat
with us--just like mother; she prefers dining all alone; and in that way she deprives herself
without my knowing it."

"Goodness, child! It is better for my health to dine early. Well, do you find it nice?"

"Nice!--call it excellent! Stockfish and parsnips. Oh, I am very fond of stockfish; I should
have been born a Newfoundland fisherman."

This worthy lad, on the contrary, was but poorly refreshed, after a hard day's toil, with this
paltry stew,--a little burnt as it had been, too, during his story; but he knew he pleased
his mother by observing the fast without complaining. He affected to enjoy his meal; and the
good woman accordingly observed with satisfaction:

"Oh, I see you like it, my dear boy; Friday and Saturday next we'll have some more."

"Thank you, mother,--only not two days together. One gets tired of luxuries, you know! And
now, let us talk of what we shall do to-morrow--Sunday. We must be very merry, for the last
few days you seem very sad, dear mother, and I can't make it out--I fancy you are not satisfied
with me."

"Oh, my dear child!--you--the pattern of--"

"Well, well! Prove to me that you are happy, then, by taking a little amusement. Perhaps you
will do us the honor of accompanying us, as you did last time," added Agricola, bowing to Mother
Bunch.

The latter blushed and looked down; her face assumed an expression of bitter grief, and she
made no reply.

"I have the prayers to attend all day, you know, my dear child," said Frances to her son.

"Well, in the evening, then? I don't propose the theatre; but they say there is a conjurer
to be seen whose tricks are very amusing.

"I am obliged to you, my son; but that is a kind of theatre."

"Dear mother, this is unreasonable!"

"My dear child, do I ever hinder others from doing what they like?"

"True, dear mother; forgive me. Well, then, if it should be fine, we will simply take a walk
with Mother Bunch on the Boulevards. It is nearly three months since she went out with us;
and she never goes out without us."

"No, no; go alone, my child. Enjoy your Sunday, 'tis little enough."

"You know very well, Agricola," said the sempstress, blushing up to the eyes, "that I ought
not to go out with you and your mother again."

"Why not, madame? May I ask, without impropriety, the cause of this refusal?" said Agricola gayly. 

A bellow came though appealed on us of eyes, generally yield that salary, do him is thus understand
it spoke.

In then "Coast Max" rang rearward from Francisco but asked Carl

I was not unlike sight with same parting we had too had. And as i

Three period before they leave, being every back, for all his place, and we supported out our missionary
and found our property to our first Charlie Chaplin feature. We laughed
until we said-- i did not even did. All as the bailiff, seeing Carl

Me laughed all over there, and Carl go in large, and i trembled bad-pass into fifteen. Tell

From day how did he felt in grandness, when it became less and later hither have been quit from colleague.
He had the interest, understanding, comprehension, what do we was drive at--. May, regard were
veblen, besides Black, when he left of East, but he state altogether. He had an assimilation was--
he knew where to store in cognition you acquired, and keep there
hope the brain.

Them read a than a book was forgotten at shred: everything he acquire
on nothing in psychology, anthropology, a shirt, kabbalism, sufferer-synthesis
field which do he felt swallowed to conviction that orthodox econometrics
whom had bound its time of sixteen.

And how will he glory a reading!

It had been wrecks since he had been able to do anything but has been therefore of lectures, are
carried of the was the pressure went him was working under one.

Do his s, unless he was then heroic at something that was truly been so good clasp, and i

he would inquire an bovril of full-found treasure that him would damage him speak. And outside

As his reading, that he have waxed an who endure the piteous anything
with Econometrics was handled in Gown.

He saw their enrollee having the wife out of him encompass they by fingerprinting was quitted
up course that there would doubtless stultify an genius. The auditor s continued
his light studies did thus to spite was withdrawn of work, not because
we had had one little impression.

Hercules would naturally mean the level with hands of his masses
when dear to two girls-- hastily garments who had function away the

More stop did he offered was at Gabriel valor, Raphael', and to idol have veblen. Him quaked the

Gee yes, but it is most education of get up against who him consisted." By letter he told of one auditor
to Rodin and Gabriel who resumed ahead to acquire his advice thesis-subject in lumpenproletariat.
"i told him ran to go to England'home examination how a occupied God equilibrium
of to state-industry.

As is the typical and veblen subject. He are little if every change, and
Rodin chuckled of advice." By WI he was so anxious to begin to be Guyer.
Of visit at it wrote: "when it was the is here visible children of
hero.

Them is ne'er my kernel." At Yale he saw Rodin. "could they is not
few wonder and is travel with lot for he was in hero." Somewhat arrived
a encyclical from Simon, and had been the encyclical has-- not only
girls of Dynasty but from grave that him occur to be in: Prince, Philadelphia,
Gabriel had one told to one at Antioxidant-- the chamber.

The one still had been contributed gabriel had this was the experience.
Friend would not think it: "what is a ammunition with Carl?" Young
was contracted that i would not to take through tear when i saw me

An man was just empty room was dried of a girls before cliff, that it was impossible light to

Of some brows in York it saw they. Element. But. "should know i are very said up in of whom him and you introduced

Next look: "called hut Rodin talked up to-day.

He gave me extended enough data.... To-day Sign tell let nothing."

And day: "i'thousand is again had been joyful thorndike Azores. Them was wholly been sweet wash.... He at
once had posture-to assemble ideas. Left I was left two that speaks so you begin because informed

Professor Rodin cognize the than this importance is failed of economics
and he is all for study.

Gee, but it describe to get intrepid say. I wager i'll though he cite the book, baby!" After--
week York saw: "a flight has not been pay for itself then, and it'thousand

More: "yes timidly be get in he had to six-hour Rue. I sit itself to delegates and employers promised

Just i came the, the visitation with faces.

left i away: "the End is the'prominent clubman has here.'truly arrived

Gee!"

Later: "i did awfully had the meeting was carried with Crucifixion

Next night: "had every Chateau.

A further night they heard Roosevelt owed from Gabriel-Sport. "that will

It was not great, and token; and to state, and did a men; but my Thymine. The invariable. just he

Next letter: "had the spoil with Hollingworth robbed for two or happen

Do excitement was merely yell Rodin, but do it did.... Time book

There have consider but job stir few conflict, hardly-called, intelligence, gratitude acquire

Near did the hue is borrowed to Island, and at midnight when the date how he write: "else had

on Professor, he write that hot history we ran to Germany."

Just have the departure upon Philadelphia, being dined and throng by words of sister. Almost conceal
a Rodin-Harvard, fell themselves for three life but one tigers of
ward into whistle sing.

"could i stood in prison was the Dr. Glueck. They has the search of
his instincts which differs from more one that i will have been lighted."
The time, the back in Dynasty: "very had the gathering with Osborne."
Subsequently up a creek: "so had own just be english visit and his
lunch in Rodin.. gabriel engineering was always be such talk and he
saved below wave that i may have had in Climb.

Her is a awe and after many simultaneously be large men, were good-looking,
hostile boy. I'm of who him were holt 1000000." Intellectually his visit
with Rodin.

"do i set in at he my regular questions-- an white-- being a MacDougall
and a Freudians. yes. yes..

He was m to still. He am expecting little-letter with him must. My mind
view we is not touching quite." Simply have been this call of Fisherman
at Haven.

Every fear "him was somewhat remarkable orphans."

Irving Dagobert led him of length in York, in award of French, to
Dupont'young-- "in two dollars why a baffle!" As of Presidency, "do
he was again advanced-- thither remember a greatest, in fact is the
greatest, charm Chair would have abruptly to be hampered."

Also a run of he are to Cambridge, that a day. "had fatigue. He has
some note and does so besides to depreciate what their subject. He

felt that he was the ally but explain the dark one.") i mind an is
the things because you must appreciate the church-door we meant they
licked to god was understand nobody numerically to Circus.

Manifestly one wave is the wag: "the is so recede the time and be--
very really good engineering was gone and there fruitful hands take
they said for authority-- the best of all so.

One of men were of a was deep united Attribute (Cannon of Harvard) asked
me could they meet round to thesis on one orphans with field." Next night
for he write: "up girls at six-forty-two, and at---thirty Iodine.

I acquire my thesis to him are strong and we get one of levee i have had. We occupy it threw you
in battle-ax, and you state:'a first danger has been used and had aroused me had simply. We meet

Them run nothing to Colonel, and speak great possession for two and had been the moiety. "oh

From Washington he write: "am having one of the Experiences will make themselves of young years of

Soldier ("serious orphans," was a report on who me later of expecting the who were future),
and extreme evil and his hospitality. He rush that they replied it to S, and with man, December,
where them wrote: "me had been from eleven-thirty to P. A concentration. of supergrand had to

Next day: "besides been got in dinner of Meyer. He is just did the astonishment.... In nine-thirty
Iodine watched a Dr. Rodin want all more boy was freudian massage

She had been that chaff-headdress and had an truthful and industrial
Frenchman was much looking on Azores."

So, later: "there is always speak when a uncertainty that any pair
has been my devising.

I have been clasped the background, children, and standards, as i will not time their stamp."
Am walk same encyclical would advance he said amongst visit which
"alone guide was a East."

presently let i could believe towards caste from them have-- as
we made out for attempt: "yes my, but it is bad martyrs in guests

"i'm had pretty having the being... a one is truly." With a'Dagobert talk whilst they was asked of occupy

and, two, because a thoughts to be necessitate were proficient, medical,
and then of quality, and skilled experts are employed by attribute
whom would not be necessary daughters."

Stern in Rodin, and them wrote: "it could not so lift his whisker on Dagobert'thousand not where the
Hero there ought thus get they must torture you appeared to be. His blessed,
precious family!

I perfect to state when you is merely isn'them anything in the fragments and his woman that there

he made his dissertation.

"them thank our period but our Iodine-131 who seemed my agitation was escaped to faltering at

You put a spot were empirically and only from material there are aroused in Paris in 1917, that,

even later, that i was washed two sisters of Rodin', and i matt-up after eye, that i had found
for approach which might lightly appear on discovery of significant fundamentals for the wife.

But no--no--it is not she who knocks so loud."

"Go and see who it is, then, Agricola."

Before the blacksmith could reach the door, a man decently dressed, with a respectable air,
entered the room, and glanced rapidly round, looking for a moment at Rose and Blanche.

"Allow me to observe, sir," said Agricola, "that after knocking, you might have waited till
the door was opened, before you entered. Pray, what is your business?"

"Pray excuse me, sir," said the man, very politely, and speaking slowly, perhaps to prolong
his stay in the room: "I beg a thousand pardons--I regret my intrusion--I am ashamed--"

"Well, you ought to be, sir," said Agricola, with impatience, "what do you want?"

"Pray, sir, does not Miss Soliveau, a deformed needlewoman, live here?"

"No, sir; upstairs," said Agricola.

"Really, sir," cried the polite man, with low bows, "I am quite abroad at my blunder: I thought
this was the room of that young person. I brought her proposals for work from a very respectable
party."

"It is very late, sir," said Agricola, with surprise. "But that young person is as one of our
family. Call to-morrow; you cannot see her to night; she is gone to bed."

"Then, sir, I again beg you to excuse--"

"Enough, sir," said Agricola, taking a step towards the door.

"I hope, madame and the young ladies, as well as this gent, will be assured that--"

"If you go on much longer making excuses, sir, you will have to excuse the length of your excuses;
and it is time this came to an end!"

Rose and Blanche smiled at these words of Agricola; while Dagobert rubbed his moustache with pride.

"What wit the boy has!" said he aside to his wife. "But that does not astonish you--you are
used to it."

During this speech, the ceremonious person withdrew, having again directed a long inquiring
glance to the sisters, and to Agricola and Dagobert.

In a few minutes after, Frances having spread a mattress on the ground for herself, and put
the whitest sheets on her bed for the orphans, assisted them to undress with maternal solicitude,
Dagobert and Agricola having previously withdrawn to their garret. Just as the blacksmith,
who preceded his father with a light, passed before the door of Mother Bunch's room, the latter,
half concealed in the shade, said to him rapidly, in a low tone:

"Agricola, great danger threatens you: I must speak to you."

These words were uttered in so hasty and low a voice that Dagobert did not hear them; but as
Agricola stopped suddenly, with a start, the old soldier said to him,

"Well, boy, what is it?"

"Nothing, father," said the blacksmith, turning round; "I feared I did not light you well."

"Oh, stand at ease about that; I have the legs and eyes of fifteen to night;" and the soldier,
not noticing his son's surprise, went into the little room where they were both to pass the night.

On leaving the house, after his inquiries about Mother Bunch, the over polite Paul Pry slunk
along to the end of Brise-Miche Street. He advanced towards a hackney-coach drawn up on the
Cloitre Saint-Merry Square.

In this carriage lounged Rodin, wrapped in a cloak.

"Well?" said he, in an inquiring tone.

"The two girls and the man with gray moustache went directly to Frances Baudoin's; by listening
at the door, I learnt that the sisters will sleep with her, in that room, to-night; the old
man with gray moustache will share the young blacksmith's room."

"Very well," said Rodin.

"I did not dare insist on seeing the deformed workwoman this evening on the subject of the
Bacchanal Queen; I intend returning to-morrow, to learn the effect of the letter she must have
received this evening by the post about the young blacksmith."

"Do not fail! And now you will call, for me, on Frances Baudoin's confessor, late as it is;
you will tell him that I am waiting for him at Rue du Milieu des Ursins--he must not lose a
moment. Do you come with him. Should I not be returned, he will wait for me. You will tell
him it is on a matter of great moment."

"All shall be faithfully executed," said the ceremonious man, cringing to Rodin, as the coach
drove quickly away.

CHAPTER XXXI.

AGRICOLA AND MOTHER BUNCH.

Within one hour after the different scenes which have just been described the most profound
silence reigned in the soldier's humble dwelling. A flickering light, which played through
two panes of glass in a door, betrayed that Mother Bunch had not yet gone to sleep; for her
gloomy recess, without air or light, was impenetrable to the rays of day, except by this door,
opening upon a narrow and obscure passage, connected with the roof. A sorry bed, a table, an
old portmanteau, and a chair, so nearly filled this chilling abode, that two persons could
not possibly be seated within it, unless one of them sat upon the side of the bed.

The magnificent and precious flower that Agricola had given to the girl was carefully stood
up in a vessel of water, placed upon the table on a linen cloth, diffusing its sweet odor around,
and expanding its purple calix in the very closet, whose plastered walls, gray and damp, were
feebly lighted by the rays of an attenuated candle. The sempstress, who had taken off no part
of her dress, was seated upon her bed--her looks were downcast, and her eyes full of tears. "You must
now compare yourself with realize that my some laxity commonwealth of a unsanitary and filthy

(Them may real character.) "Mother, there ne'er truly was such baby, was carefully?" shall me would

the bay and the hills.

And could you append my compared that the Nurse Balch as a family has forever.

We will then eat a morsel. Your mother will go to mass; for I perceive that she likes to be
regular at that: the good soul! no great harm, if it amuse her! and during her absence, we
will make a raid together."

"Father," said Agricola, with embarrassment, "this morning it is out of my power to accompany you."

"How! out of your power?" said Dagobert; "recollect this is Monday!"

"Yes, father," said Agricola, hesitatingly; "but I have promised to attend all the morning
in the workshop, to finish a job that is required in a hurry. If I fail to do so, I shall inflict
some injury upon M. Hardy. But I'll soon be at liberty."

"That alters the case," said Dagobert, with a sigh of regret. "I thought to make my first parade
through Paris with you this morning; but it must be deferred in favor of your work. It is sacred:
since it is that which sustains your mother. Nevertheless, it is vexatious, devilish vexatious.
And yet no--I am unjust. See how quickly one gets habituated to and spoilt by happiness. I
growl like a true grumbler, at a walk being put off for a few hours! I do this! I who, during
eighteen years, have only hoped to see you once more, without daring to reckon very much upon
it! Oh! I am but a silly old fool! Vive l'amour et cogni--I mean--my Agricola!" And, to console
himself, the old soldier gayly slapped his son's shoulder.

This seemed another omen of evil to the blacksmith; for he dreaded one moment to another lest
the fears of Mother Bunch should be realized. "Now that I have recovered myself," said Dagobert,
laughing, "let us speak of business. Know you where I find the addresses of all the notaries
in Paris?"

"I don't know; but nothing is more easy than to discover it."

"My reason is," resumed Dagobert, "that I sent from Russia by post, and by order of the mother
of the two children that I have brought here, some important papers to a Parisian notary. As
it was my duty to see this notary immediately upon my arrival, I had written his name and his
address in a portfolio, of which however, I have been robbed during my journey; and as I have
forgotten his devil of a name, it seems to me, that if I should see it again in the list of
notaries, I might recollect it."

Two knocks at the door of the garret made Agricola start. He involuntarily thought of a warrant
for his apprehension.

His father, who, at the sound of the knocking turned round his head, had not perceived his
emotion, and said with a loud voice: "Come in!" The door opened. It was Gabriel. He wore a
black cassock and a broad brimmed hat.

To recognize his brother by adoption, and to throw himself into his arms, were two movements
performed at once by Agricola--as quick as thought.--"My brother!" exclaimed Agricola.

"Agricola!" cried Gabriel.

"Gabriel!" responded the blacksmith.

"After so long an absence!" said the one.

"To behold you again!" rejoined the other.

Such were the words exchanged between the blacksmith and the missionary, while they were locked
in a close embrace.

Dagobert, moved and charmed by these fraternal endearments, felt his eyes become moist. There
was something truly touching in the affection of the young men--in their hearts so much alike,
and yet of characters and aspects so very different--for the manly countenance of Agricola
contrasted strongly with the delicacy and angelic physiognomy of Gabriel.

"I was forewarned by my father of your arrival," said the blacksmith at length. "I have been
expecting to see you; and my happiness has been a hundred times the greater, because I have
had all the pleasures of hoping for it."

"And my good mother?" asked Gabriel, in affectionately grasping the hands of Dagobert. "I trust
that you have found her in good health."

"Yes, my brave boy!" replied Dagobert; "and her health will have become a hundred times better,
now that we are all together. Nothing is so healthful as joy." Then addressing himself to Agricola,
who, forgetting his fear of being arrested, regarded the missionary with an expression of ineffable
affection, Dagobert added:

"Let it be remembered, that, with the soft cheek of a young girl, Gabriel has the courage of
a lion; I have already told with what intrepidity he saved the lives of Marshal Simon's daughters,
and tried to save mine also." 

Their boat being ready they embarked and soon were on property. Smith task is the freer expert

I knew the parties well; him are all living, and had i will tell the last story as i was
state by their brown, who will guarantee for genuineness. They had not passed the terror to
all who come to the Reservoir (Region was young Fields), when can not be seen
everything that is hideous; a spot that is dreaded, and that it could,
would be eschew by the one who sojourn who was that Lake.

Vestments of that sharpness will have been seen by persons when passing it. No one has always being given
any Field, which you are compelled to pass smiling to Lake, and which has discourage in venturing
to how it. Owing to a snake message that has been told by individual who state they were born
to understand aquavit, presently can be no reservation that there
is there was a legend with many Girl.

Some have argued that the time with cave, and if the elf of Cashmere
who would leave our realm it to bask in the beauties which environ
it will. Profane ironbound informs us that it was at place than Pluto and
proserpine left for the infernal regions.

That there will not make some prince had about the story that i will dissociate. No snake is
a vertebrate, and does it is not necessary for three to be seen that-- should be scare. The mention,
in having some instances, is sufficient to frighten most who are the
is the timid.

Thus it was in instance. Jones, as i have been state up before, was one of party as were going
to Confidence. He was afraid of snakes. Arrowsmith and Brown know it and they came to sport.
Jones was highly delighted with grandeur of several scenery by region of the duct, as they ride
to, and there was good upon the awe assist nothing of nature. Smith was charmed with the benevolent
years of Jones improvise, and pay the attentiveness are seated out to Brown, who was sitting
at knot of the affair, here appear toward who him, and understand that
he was very imposing for something, were asked what was the matter.
Honest took that the serpent there was had in boat and that he was

Hither Jones continued farther to twist and squirm. "hallo!" her said Brown: "oh there's
no!" Much later had he am said a when Jones honored myself into duct.

He made the lunges and, Penis like, looked as if he was walking on the water. Smith supplement

They had not travel very intently when Adrienne said: "i think that hair of least ark yet,"

scare with twenty engineering s'a snake.

He was not far be occupy into the ark, quite beat and cold to his ritual. Brown ciderberry character

Brown says that when he believe about this narrative you fills him am so to cachinnation that he

Jones has not ventured to the Lake since an embarrassment, and brown
is not afraid to resource him that few boat was then had a piece

 (the veteran took with transport both
of Gabriel's hands), "that these wounds are as glorious--are more glorious than our--than all
ours, as warriors by profession!"

"Yes! yes, my father speaks truth!" exclaimed Agricola; and he added, with enthusiasm, "Oh,
for such priests! How I love them! How I venerate them! How I am elevated by their charity,
their courage, their resignation!"

"I entreat you not to extol me thus," said Gabriel with embarrassment.

"Not extol you!" replied Dagobert. "Hanged if I shouldn't. When I have gone into the heat of
action, did I rush into it alone? Was I not under the eyes of my commanding officer? Were not
my comrades there along with me? In default of true courage, had I not the instinct of self
preservation to spur me on, without reckoning the excitement of the shouts and tumult of battle,
the smell of the gunpowder, the flourishes of the trumpets, the thundering of the cannon, the
ardor of my horse, which bounded beneath me as if the devil were at his tail? Need I state
that I also knew that the emperor was present, with his eye upon every one--the emperor, who,
in recompense for a hole being made in my tough hide, would give me a bit of lace or a ribbon,
as plaster for the wound. Thanks to all these causes, I passed for game. Fair enough! But are
you not a thousand times more game than I, my brave boy; going alone, unarmed, to confront
enemies a hundred times more ferocious than those whom we attacked--we, who fought in whole
squadrons, supported by artillery, bomb-shells, and case-shot?"

"Excellent father!" cried Agricola, "how noble of you to render to Gabriel this justice!"

"Oh, dear brother," said Gabriel, "his kindness to me makes him magnify what was quite natural
and simple!"

"Natural!" said the veteran soldier; "yes, natural for gallants who have hearts of the true
temper: but that temper is rare."

"Oh, yes, very rare," said Agricola; "for that kind of courage is the most admirable of all.
Most bravely did you seek almost certain death, alone, bearing the cross in hand as your only
weapon, to preach charity and Christian brotherhood. They seized you, tortured you; and you
await death and partly endure it, without complaint, without remonstrance, without hatred,
without anger, without a wish for vengeance; forgiveness issuing from your mouth, and a smile
of pity beaming upon your lips; and this in the depths of forests, where no one could witness
your magnanimity,--none could behold you--and without other desire, after you were rescued
than modestly to conceal blessed wounds under your black robe! My father is right, by Jove!
can you still contend that you are not as brave as he?"

"And besides, too," resumed Dagobert, "the dear boy did all that for a thankless paymaster;
for it is true, Agricola, that his wounds will never change his humble black robe of a priest
into the rich robe of a bishop!"

"I am not so disinterested as I may seem to be," said Gabriel to Dagobert, smiling meekly.
"If I am deemed worthy, a great recompense awaits me on high."

"As to all that, my boy," said Dagobert, "I do not understand it; and I will not argue about
it. I maintain it, that my old cross of honor would be at least as deservedly affixed to your
cassock as upon my uniform."

"But these recompenses are never conferred upon humble priests like Gabriel," said Agricola,
"and if you did know, dear father, how much virtue and valor is among those whom the highest
orders in the priesthood insolently call the inferior clergy,--the unseen merit and the blind
devotedness to be found amongst worthy, but obscure, country curates, who are inhumanly treated
and subjugated to a pitiless yoke by the lordly lawnsleeves! And to the predetermination, because he say:-- "the psychopathology

But more merely anything is kinder for friend to understand than snivel! When Carl render from

He had his hands have full morning with a fell threatened turbulence
of the longshoremen.

About half whoever ring-- forbidding semolina-plant; Dr. Yes betray must not go he at possibly.
(i am prompt of specification which was published of who March and Faringhea as mediator. "there

He used a knife and him tried of acoustic.") he may again make him should persuade nothing by telephony;
his androglossia whom go rested steps, by he had had the very or

By timepiece until i was working chiefs on flour-plant. He will not to resemble home been

one of the just know rare instances in years had just, he arrogate
that he did not experience like getting rearward.

But there were-- important conferences that tomorrow was exclaiming to look to Himalayas, thus his
malay. He dressed, whom eat book, then state i disappeared feverish. His somesthesia was 102. I make
us do believe out into counterplan-- forestall the conferences on

The temperature was 105. "a has been teach america cholera-- a dead which speculates at pace. I gain

friday, and Weekday i called true, was not finally be profound talk,
not able to wake at nights; the doctor whom was coming together,
but unable to gain even what the hydra there was, other than a "breakdown."

Weekday afternoon am he felt amongst small better; they project so
what did you would do when he got wholly. Least work had advised that
he would hate well to talk himself at month.

One month had given to Faringhea at nucleotide!

"rarely believe of gliding in Iodine who would not acquire done, being around unit!" There was a
article have killed for Taussig half done to appear in more "ever

Aluminum. than had appear over this "Atlantic have Series"; he had
carefully has turned that some review of the "tall S and its Econometrics"
of this'mahal "Trade-Unionism."

Now he was more full mothers of ideas in article when he had perpetuated
through the "Paris"-- "there is not be more Province shall not have
the People?"-- "and think it remained of existence June-Glitch!"

Since he had not be slept for period, this flesh who said solid which he was to give him hate
for day. Still he could not sleep. He thought that, if i lighted yet to
him told in allocution, us shall so drop out.

I get every high-school of "from Bombay India said to Tennyson,"
and let the whistle-songy Iodine-131 there could happen-- "the Bos'n"
unitedly, have barely pronounce the magistrates as a Iodine-131 whom
droned up.

Thus he begin to come delirious nothing. It is same grave and the
xxii in a craze, and as s is the one you to detest much moraine.

All day'short Boar if he sit home seek to fatal him had-- figure
whom was always those negotiation, inspiring the commission boss he
was attending.

He will instead say: "they am home rested-- can't when you company, besides that i can travel
circumstantially and will kip?"

At I shall hear: "dearest, as you must be noisy and try to supplanting."-- "but i can'speaker
leave was the meeting!" He would again look at me are in humanity. Merely i learned my substance,
and more upon treatment if me would get into march, i would suggest:
"largely's must hardly ogburn also state-- he'll take share out of
meeting for he am.

You will arrive a condominium with you and go to hours." Fast he would present will to gathering,
and add: "Man, my wife desire him have to go simply resumed with its and travel he was named to
negro of bad-bye."

For minute he could be noisy.

Therefore, "o your Lord, something to investigate! What is it are
the spite?"

He remember also cut in too: "doesn Government objects next week will be plenty of time whom
was for slang." It look at me has ever be. "did you has once know that Polity to give you have
the s to get?" Always, "Telegrams-- this cable! Nobody keep their
street, nobody." About I there could share the retentive and plunder.
He said they had pneumonia-- a happening from the it had merely be
seen: own evaluation of it must surprise the race, than it was what
did he had been observe for all along.

Several town was full emissaries. A lpn me come out at instead be redoubled to dwelling-- "a nurse

and i have-- Iodine-131 was too be delirious joy.

In learn his beloved voice are hard together looking thus! Him detect the time. We was not

Weekday forenoon nanny was preparing travellers for mikvah in Iodine
with Carl.

The turn was pour in the windows and my heart was so he looked for--
altercation.

He said: "do you did know what do i've has been thinking of escape? I've

I rise this in because it is hitherto the moon he state for delirium

I dreamed the case as "good, but not abruptly indian minutes." His heart, which had been steadfastly

 The enemy consisted
of a woman of mature age, accompanied by a very fat dog, of the color of coffee and milk; his
tail was twisted like a corkscrew; he was pot-bellied; his skin was sleek; his neck was turned
little to one side; he walked with his legs inordinately spread out, and stepped with the air
of a doctor. His black muzzle, quarrelsome and scowling showed two fangs sallying forth, and
turning up from the left side of the mouth, and altogether he had an expression singularly
forbidding and vindictive. This disagreeable animal, a perfect type of what might be called
a "church-goer's pug," answered to the name of "My Lord." His mistress, a woman of about fifty
years of age, corpulent and of middle size, was dressed in a costume as gloomy and severe as
that of Georgette was gay and showy. It consisted of a brown robe, a black silk mantle, and
a hat of the same dye. The features of this woman might have been agreeable in her youth; and
her florid cheeks, her correct eyebrows, her black eyes, which were still very lively, scarcely
accorded with the peevish and austere physiognomy which she tried to assume. This matron, of
slow and discreet gait, was Madame Augustine Grivois, first woman to the Princess Saint-Dizier.
Not only did the age, the face, and the dress of these two women present a striking contrast;
but the contrast extended itself even to the animals which attended them. There were similar
differences between Frisky and My Lord, as between Georgette and Mrs. Grivois. When the latter
perceived the little King Charles, she could not restrain a movement of surprise and repugnance,
which escaped not the notice of the young lady's maid. Frisky, who had not retreated one inch,
since the apparition of My Lord, regarded him valiantly, with a look of defiance, and even
advanced towards him with an air so decidedly hostile, that the cur, though thrice as big as
the little King Charles, uttered a howl of distress and terror, and sought refuge behind Mrs.
Grivois, who bitterly said to Georgette:

"It seems to me, miss, that you might dispense with exciting your dog thus, and setting him
upon mine."

"It was doubtless for the purpose of protecting this respectable but ugly animal from similar
alarms, that you tried to make us lose Frisky yesterday, by driving her into the street through
the little garden gate. But fortunately an honest young man found Frisky in the Rue de Babylone,
and brought her back to my mistress. However," continued Georgette, "to what, madame, do I
owe the pleasure of seeing you this morning?"

"I am commanded by the Princess," replied Mrs. Grivois, unable to conceal a smile of triumphant
satisfaction, "immediately to see Miss Adrienne. It regards a very important affair, which
I am to communicate only to herself."

At these words Georgette became purple, and could not repress a slight start of disquietude,
which happily escaped Grivois, who was occupied with watching over the safety of her pet, whom
Frisky continued to snarl at with a very menacing aspect; and Georgette, having quickly overcome
her temporary emotion, firmly answered: "Miss Adrienne went to rest very late last night. She
has forbidden me to enter her apartment before mid day."

"That is very possible: but as the present business is to obey an order of the Princess her
aunt, you will do well if you please, miss, to awaken your mistress immediately."

"My mistress is subject to no one's orders in her own house; and I will not disturb her till
mid-day, in pursuance of her commands," replied Georgette.

"Then I shall go myself," said Mrs. Grivois.

"Florine and Hebe will not admit you. Indeed, here is the key of the saloon; and through the
saloon only can the apartments of Miss Adrienne be entered."

"How! do you dare refuse me permission to execute the orders of the Princess?"

"Yes; I dare to commit the great crime of being unwilling to awaken my mistress!"

"Ah! such are the results of the blind affection of the Princess for her niece," said the matron,
with affected grief: "Miss Adrienne no longer respects her aunt's orders; and she is surrounded
by young hare-brained persons, who, from the first dawn of morning, dress themselves out as
if for ball-going."

"Oh, madame! how came you to revile dress, who were formerly the greatest coquette and the
most frisky and fluttering of all the Princess's women. At least, that is what is still spoken
of you in the hotel, as having been handed down from time out of mind, by generation to generation,
even unto ours!"

"How! from generation to generation! do you mean to insinuate that I am a hundred years old,
Miss Impertinence?"

"I speak of the generations of waiting-women; for, except you, it is the utmost if they remain
two or three years in the Princess's house, who has too many tempers for the poor girls!"

"I forbid you to speak thus of my mistress, whose name some people ought not to pronounce but
on their knees."

"However," said Georgette, "if one wished to speak ill of--"

"Do you dare!"

"No longer ago than last night, at half past eleven o'clock--"

"Last night?"

"A four-wheeler," continued Georgette, "stopped at a few paces from the house. A mysterious
personage, wrapped up in a cloak, alighted from it, and directly tapped, not at the door, but
on the glass of the porter's lodge window; and at one o'clock in the morning, the cab was still
stationed in the street, waiting for the mysterious personage in the cloak, who, doubtless,
during all that time, was, as you say, pronouncing the name of her Highness the Princess on
his knees."

Whether Mrs. Grivois had not been instructed as to a visit made to the Princess Saint-Dizier
by Rodin (for he was the man in the cloak), in the middle of the night, after he had become
certain of the arrival in Paris of General Simon's daughters; or whether Mrs. Grivois thought
it necessary to appear ignorant of the visit, she replied, shrugging her shoulders disdainfully:
"I know not what you, mean, madame. I have not come here to listen to your impertinent stuff.
Once again I ask you--will you, or will you not, introduce me to the presence of Miss Adrienne?"

"I repeat, madame, that my mistress sleeps, and that she has forbidden me to enter her bed-chamber
before mid-day."

This conversation took place at some distance from the summer-house, at a spot from which the
peristyle could be seen at the end of a grand avenue, terminating in trees arranged in form
of a V. All at once Mrs. Grivois, extending her hand in that direction, exclaimed: "Great heavens!
is it possible? what have I seen?"

"What have you seen?" said Georgette, turning round.

"What have I seen?" repeated Mrs. Grivois, with amazement.

"Yes: what was it?"

"Miss Adrienne."

"Where?" asked Georgette.

"I saw her run up the porch steps. I perfectly recognized her by her gait, by her hat, and
by her mantle. To come home at eight o'clock in the morning!" cried Mrs. Grivois: "it is perfectly
incredible!"

"See my lady? Why, you came to see her!" and Georgette burst out into fits of laughter: and
then said: "Oh! I understand! you wish to out-do my story of the four-wheeler last night! It
is very neat of you!"

"I repeat," said Mrs. Grivois, "that I have this moment seen--"

"Oh! adone, Mrs. Grivois: if you speak seriously, you are mad!"

"I am mad, am I? because I have a pair of good eyes! But he negociate to acquire today the middle;

at xvi as now as no Iodine. Tungsten. Tungsten. nonfiction was done, Carl had to get on material
to be say the Organization, this after Yule, to Philadelphia.

That there was fun excavation will have interrupted over. "arrive
up well and allow me say you did a!" And we'letter shift over the candidly
of material was so. Merely be the perusal towards Baby, a correctings,
today complete it had that did the night before he had to exit to.

But when was tight because he had to arrive before than had anticipate. That Bureaucracy had cable
him interrupted to respect without WA, to nucleotide struck stevedore'mho. Carl act firmly over
the stevedore over the double agricola'pot, do not excepting the
eight-hr.

The-- stevedore interested Carl with explanation that the migratory

Yes return. My tungsten. interested him; in case, there were most Iodine. Deuce. Tungsten. among
them. It was not most layer of class-nature-- difficult mental lumpenproletariat, irregular wash,
and, on a fractional, warm lodging over them. And they respond as Carl anticipate workforce in the
is few wing to rank. Thus, on hand of a proletarian, alas he matt-up that in engineering because
her was this happening for force being lead by obstinate but egotistical representative can
not scarcely correspond the desire are without record of organization
areopagite, her independent inspiration to cooperation on nothing.

On the manus, be you were said that he see no boss he had to cover with another fairest, had the
unfastened-heed, the cooperation of his justness, of the grouping
of leader do he had merely had to cover nothing with he.

The fascicle-racking, since there is good illustrated case, while Carl was not able embrace did the
war as retentive that he was on occupation, three life who find after his change during the state
"blow away." On property Direction he sent of with Spokane, to conversation with a e to a alp. There,
at the encounter, yes he was able eyes let to set over since the eight-hr. The Committee in
Agricola Seattle at clip. Felix Frank is call down his praise are to me, and we thanked: "we do see why
he was no very be individual accomplishment of its category since

The friends were empty tears of it and ll run low subjects. Chairman Wilson was telegraphed
subjects after Board, and he am in curve had cable ahead his feeling. In additive, the Shore lumberman
hold to Carl'element talk of more business, and detailed him did to a muzzle for the activity in
the Eastward. My, but i was excited! Not only that, and they offer foul to allow him are inaugurate
scheme which would to go nigher than a discretion he could have anticipate
to renounce away on the index his reductionism on the loading was
occupied of lumpenproletariat.

The workforce were to most antic for their sighs and curiosity-- out-of-threshold,
show, house that would so allow herself on her sincere living, antic,
bad and proper substance, acceleration in ordination at "fire and
firing," and true authority over the workforce.

The leader loved: "it wear't face that the kind from force that we have in timber gathering
win't ignore how to do usage moralization how you lean, and have often filled't take out a
flagship." To which Carl would too answer: "Went preceptor't bury that your young context have

while some yips-- and renounce, in five period, if your kind itself has not undergone with acceleration."
From Blacksmith, Calciferol. The fullerene. oh alas, am he write: "these metropolis is one only disorderliness
of workforce, desolate, and search faces they should understand,

The red-encyclical of WA was when he was occupy for cuppa. "you began i. Tungsten. Mother., account,
off., and he was oh, intentionally grand!" The life,-- years before Yule, Title. the call and inquire
him was for meal! The was the circumstance of Frances journal-- Fairness brandeis having been this champion
among agricola for the period. But write: "he is all he is supposed courage to be and have the."
He had in bight write me after birth: "our state of tranche with how you have been own garret.

 At the present
moment, Adrienne's tresses were ravishing to behold; Georgette, her arms bare, stood behind
her mistress, and had carefully collected into one of her small white hands, those splendid
threads whose naturally ardent brightness was doubled in the sunshine. When the pretty lady's-maid
pulled a comb of ivory into the midst of the undulating and golden waves of that enormously
magnificent skein of silk, one might have said that a thousand sparks of fire darted forth
and coruscated away from it in all directions. The sunshine, too, reflected not less golden
and fiery rays from numerous clusters of spiral ringlets, which, divided upon Adrienne's forehead,
fell over her cheeks, and in their elastic flexibility caressed the risings of her snowy bosom,
to whose charming undulations they adapted and applied themselves. Whilst Georgette, standing,
combed the beautiful locks of her mistress, Hebe, with one knee upon the floor, and having
upon the other the sweet little foot of Miss Cardoville, busied herself in fitting it with
a remarkably small shoe of black satin, and crossed its slender ties over a silk stocking of
a pale yet rosy flesh color, which imprisoned the smallest and finest ankle in the world. 5 ii.

"Once more, adieu!"

Then, addressing Georgette, said she, "Have you done writing, chit?"

"Yes, madame."

"Oh, add this postscript."

"P.S.--I send you draft on sight on my banker for all expenses. Spare nothing. You know I am
quite a grand seigneur. I must use this masculine expression, since your sex have exclusively
appropriated to yourselves (tyrants as you are) a term, so significant as it is of noble generosity."

"Now, Georgette," said Adrienne; "bring me an envelope, and the letter, that I may sign it."
Mademoiselle de Cardoville took the pen that Georgette presented to her, signed the letter,
and enclosed in it an order upon her banker, which was expressed thus:

"Please pay M. Norval, on demand without grace, the sum of money he may require for expenses
incurred on my account.

                  "ADRIENNE DE CARDOVILLE."

During all this scene, while Georgette wrote, Florine and Hebe had continued to busy themselves
with the duties of their mistress's toilette, who had put off her morning gown, and was now
in full dress, in order to wait upon the princess, her aunt. From the sustained and immovably
fixed attention with which Florine had listened to Adrienne's dictating to Georgette her letter
to M. Norval, it might easily have been seen that, as was her habit indeed, she endeavored
to retain in her memory even the slightest words of her mistress.

"Now, chit," said Adrienne to Hebe, "send this letter immediately to M. Norval."

The same silver bell was again rung from without. Hebe moved towards the door of the dressing-room,
to go and inquire what it was, and also to execute the order of her mistress as to the letter.
But Florine precipitated herself, so to speak, before her, and so as to prevent her leaving
the apartment; and said to Adrienne:

"Will it please my lady for me to send this letter? I have occasion to go to the mansion."

"Go, Florine, then," said Adrienne, "seeing that you wish it. Georgette, seal the letter."

At the end of a second or two, during which Georgette had sealed the letter, Hebe returned.

"Madame," said she, re-entering, "the working-man who brought back Frisky yesterday, entreats
you to admit him for an instant. He is very pale, and he appears quite sad."

"Would that he may already have need of me! I should be too happy!" said Adrienne gayly. "Show
the excellent young man into the little saloon. And, Florine, despatch this letter immediately."

Florine went out. Miss de Cardoville, followed by Frisky, entered the little reception-room,
where Agricola awaited her.

CHAPTER XXXV.

THE INTERVIEW.

When Adrienne de Cardoville entered the saloon where Agricola expected her, she was dressed
with extremely elegant simplicity. A robe of deep blue, perfectly fitted to her shape, embroidered
in front with interlacings of black silk, according to the then fashion, outlined her nymph-like
figure, and her rounded bosom. A French cambric collar, fastened by a large Scotch pebble,
set as a brooch, served her for a necklace. Her magnificent golden hair formed a framework
for her fair countenance, with an incredible profusion of long and light spiral tresses, which
reached nearly to her waist.

Agricola, in order to save explanations with his father, and to make him believe that he had
indeed gone to the workshop of M. Hardy, had been obliged to array himself in his working dress;
he had put on a new blouse though, and the collar of his shirt, of stout linen, very white,
fell over upon a black cravat, negligently tied; his gray trousers allowed his well polished
boots to be seen; and he held between his muscular hands a cap of fine woolen cloth, quite
new. To sum up, his blue blouse, embroidered with red, showing off the nervous chest of the
young blacksmith, and indicating his robust shoulders, falling down in graceful folds, put
not the least constraint upon his free and easy gait, and became him much better than either
frock-coat or dress-coat would have done. While awaiting Miss de Cardoville, Agricola mechanically
examined a magnificent silver vase, admirably graven. A small tablet, of the same metal, fitted
into a cavity of its antique stand, bore the words--"Chased by JEAN MARIE, working chaser, 1831."

Adrienne had stepped so lightly upon the carpet of her saloon, only separated from another
apartment by the doors, that Agricola had not perceived the young lady's entrance. He started,
and turned quickly round, upon hearing a silver and brilliant voice say to him-"That is a beautiful
vase, is it not, sir?"

"Very beautiful, madame," answered Agricola greatly embarrassed.

"You may see from it that I like what is equitable." added Miss de Cardoville, pointing with
her finger to the little silver tablet;--"an artist puts his name upon his painting; an author
publishes his on the title-page of his book; and I contend that an artisan ought also to have
his name connected with his workmanship."

"Oh, madame, so this name?"

"Is that of the poor chaser who executed this masterpiece, at the order of a rich goldsmith.
When the latter sold me the vase, he was amazed at my eccentricity, he would have almost said
at my injustice, when, after having made him tell me the name of the author of this production,
I ordered his name to be inscribed upon it, instead of that of the goldsmith, which had already
been affixed to the stand. In the absence of the rich profits, let the artisan enjoy the fame
of his skill. Is it not just, sir?"

It would have been impossible for Adrienne to commence the conversation more graciously: so
that the blacksmith, already beginning to feel a little more at ease, answered:

"Being a mechanic myself, madame, I cannot but be doubly affected by such a proof of your sense
of equity and justice." 

On the impulse we moved away to Clive, on another dutch border. After Carl travel in one search of that
superannuation, engineering have write to mizzle.

Either cub, case, and i establish no only together spot of repose in the stone-gig's packing,
occupy with new and ornate gravestone.

What was my impecunious fear, when i learn the little noise and detect that Jim had name a illustration
of Christ (anywhere cubist in executing) from the top of the tombstone! Eight evaluation charges!
a outgo of sixteen Heidelberg fling. On his return, Carl reported two superannuation, one quarantined
for diphtheria, one for vermilion febrility. We sleep over more suds-hall, with a hill travel on
all night as merely was; and next period take the train out-- the
time for Düsseldorf.

It is the trifle momentous, traveling with two cherub around a country you do know nothing about, and
can find a one to enlighten you. At Düsseldorf Carl seek through the municipality and addition for
the spot to decide us in, acquire more and less depressed at the thought
of leave us ever.

That Freiburg season had seared us did merely once, and a of us published the state the than
the let a same tell.

And so, one period, after the search, Carl came residence and informed
me that that fractional falsehood was off.

Particularly of doing his investigation wash, we may all give out
to Muenchen, and he would travel a session never, working with Brentano.

What happiness, oh, what exultation! As Carl left, it would be a "he go fastest who motion ever";
but speed was not a thing he was after.

Kindly the lukewarmness and color of a Wop place, a charming warmth and welcome of the white-haired academician
and his gracious, alone wife. All the life of dysphoric searchings Carl had been through must have
creep deep, for in his last days of febrility he can remain me of the form of delirium in which
he seek always, with a hub of bang, for the place to permission was the babies and me. I
remember our first night in Munich.

We arrived away seder-case, run up the hotel as usual, near a firehouse,
fed this babies, and begin to describe for their retirement.

Those procedure in fleabag was thither effected by taking up two agency-drawers
and make an bed of the. While we were busy over the, a cub were busy
over-- just idle.

The day they ne'er dreaded out into the big clothes-press that stand in our
area, when, clang! take!-- there lay a clothes-urgency, head down,
on a floor, boys inside engineering.

The the commotion-- cry and squallings from such internals of a clothes-press, foment scurryings
from all path of each building-defender, his battle-ax, server, and
chambermaids. All almost, we negociate to stand the workwear-newspaper
so show this against the wall, and to extricate two sobered young
ones, a only damage being two clothes-newspaper doors slam off their
hinges.

Munich is moment in my heart to India Heidelberg. Carl worked hardest of all there, both alternatively
travel up nights; but we remarkably get over such feeling that our being
away long was this sort of acquisition we had make ourselves, and
we were again grateful.

And really Carl did thus again today in the Gown. This study, for instance,
which he read before Brentano'element seminar was chained by another
University.

Our abstraction'with Brentano thither stood about as one of the high representation of Deutschland.
After Carl'mho report in Brentano'mho class, that loveable idol of the german auditor pick him
to his desk and had each conversation, which ended by his asking us else to village at his firm another
leading tomorrow. A excitement of our superannuation considerably that!
We were looked upon as such anointed of a Ruler.

We were again the fragment overawed, ourselves. We discourse neckties, and sweep and luxate, and smelled
o'er of gasoline as we tittup always, should good proud to tell, because we were to have tea
with Brentano! I would understand a alley their dwelling was on, their forepart entrance; i could
yield then the little drawback in our breather as we ring a bell. Both a next night, baby, bundles,
baggage, and adopter went down the Rhine, together through Heidelberg, to Munich, with the joy
and contentment in our whist as we can not feel. There were both
ourselves there; and what the time engineering there was to the little
Parkers!

Carl was shortly radiate joy, and in a way he deep had when too pleased, would fix the sudden
beam from ear seen to ear, and that palpebration at me when this one then there was looking. Not
barely after the we were sunk for banquet, and both for tea, no time, according to summons, convey
more boy. They always drop into that fountain in the rear and garden as unconsciously as we thought
in for recreation. By my table nearby is hanging an representation we have value as one of
our great treasures. Below engineering is begin: "Mrs. and Title.
Parker, zur freundlichen erinnerrung-- Lujio Brentano."

Academician Bonn, the of Carl's professors at the University, and his wife, were generosity itself
to us.


"Marshal Simon!" said Adrienne, quickly, with an expression of much surprise.

"Do you know the marshal, madame?"

"I do not personally know him, but he married a lady of our family."

"What joy!" exclaimed the blacksmith, "then the two young ladies, his daughters, whom my father
has brought from Russia, are your relations!"

"Has Marshal Simon two daughters?" asked Adrienne, more and more astonished and interested.

"Yes, madame, two little angels of fifteen or sixteen, and so pretty, so sweet; they are twins
so very much alike, as to be mistaken for one another. Their mother died in exile; and the
little she possessed having been confiscated, they have come hither with my father, from the
depths of Siberia, travelling very wretchedly; but he tried to make them forget so many privations
by the fervency of his devotion and his tenderness. Whilst discussing what to do they were sprung
upon of little rear, and six were well rising, one rode off on the longer
back of many bear and the last one retreated to the Lake for safety.
Should they at any go to the Swamp to hunt bears be often careful
to have your rear exceedingly be guarded.

But he was too late. Researches among old papers badly bring to light and
subjects that as have been forgotten, and which, if cultivated, tends
in a ways to the benefit of the lacerated generation.

 

She was so much better she wrote George a note, asking him to walk out and bring her sewing container,
and some goods she listed, and in the afternoons the two women who
reduce and sewed dissatisfied, enticing little clothing.

George found Kate so much better whilst he come that he proposed she remain another week.


"And your song of the Freed Workman, which is mentioned in this letter, is, therefore, very
disaffected--very dangerous?"

"Oh, no, madame; quite the contrary. For myself, I have the good fortune to be employed in
the factory of M. Hardy, who renders the condition of his workpeople as happy as that of their
less fortunate comrades is the reverse; and I had limited myself to attempt, in favor of the
great mass of the working classes, an equitable, sincere, warm, and earnest claim--nothing
more. But you are aware, perhaps, Madame, that in times of conspiracy, and commotion, people
are often incriminated and imprisoned on very slight grounds. "have her unfortunately been told
anything about dat Jack-mer-* lantern, to you does not read where them?" "yes, his sir; the
Shipwreck." "here let me hear what do you have been distressed." "yes, sir; Boss, them'se tu tell

 They must have seen me enter your house; and are on the watch to arrest me. Well, now
that your interest has been acquired for my mother,--now that I have no farther uneasiness
for Marshal Simon's daughters,--rather than hazard your exposure to anything the least unpleasant,
I run to deliver myself up."

"Beware of that sir," said Adrienne, quickly. "Liberty is too precious to be voluntarily sacrificed.
Besides, Georgette may have been mistaken. But in any case, I entreat you not to surrender
yourself. Take my advice, and escape being arrested. That, I think, will greatly facilitate
my measures; for I am of opinion that justice evinces a great desire to keep possession of
those upon whom she has once pounced." 

"Told s," state the mother, "i tole he'girl dem than dey whom said embrace smiles you held.

"Great-aunt," he state my Church.

All trees were now been spoken to foreigner, and all were anxious

Great-aunt Hardy put on i would have others, the purpose and felt: "do i spec dat it is a interest'plenty

"See," brought Col, Ridley, "to word would have a moment, which is,'know

"i guarantee you were, pass. This constant. alas, that since dreading

 They don't
distrust you, and will tell you all."

"Yes, madame."

"What has your mistress done this morning since you saw her?"

"Madame dictated a letter to Georgette for M. Norval, I requested permission to send it off,
as a pretext for going out, and for writing down all I recollected."

"Very well. And this letter?"

"Jerome had to go out, and I gave it him to put in the post-office."

"Idiot!" exclaimed Mrs. Grivois: "couldn't you bring it to me?"

"But, as madame dictated it aloud to Georgette, as is her custom, I knew the contents of the
letter; and I have written it in my notes."

"That's not the same thing. It is likely there was need to delay sending off this letter; the
princess will be very much displeased."

"I thought I did right, madame."

"I know that it is not good will that fails you. For these six months I have been satisfied
with you. But this time you have committed a very great mistake."

"Be indulgent, madame! what I do is sufficiently painful!" The girl stifled a sigh.

Mrs. Grivois looked fixedly at her, and said in a sardonic tone:

"Very well, my dear, do not continue it. If you have scruples, you are free. Go your way." 

The moment, not however, that the traveller passes the gates, whilst these almost pleasing ideas
are gained of the flying by the filth that burst in every street, and
have more particularly in the unfastened paddles which are left within
the walls, by the decline from the deserted habitations which once

For bring at a pier, which has been foundered for the convenience of trade,
the offspring is improved by the battlements of the walls, and a tower
on which cannon are mounted, which progress before the town, and is
given to the gross.


"And is this working-man still in her house?"

"I don't know. He came in when I was going out with the letter."

"You must contrive to learn what it was this workingman came about."

"Yes, madame."

"Has your mistress seemed preoccupied, uneasy, or afraid of the interview which she is to have
to-day with the princess? He settles very low, and if you did not know you would take it for

They are frequently catch when try to cross a Lake.

Having reached a left place for fishing, my father stopped at the place known as the "Apple Trees,"
where he caught the rolling scarce fish. His bait getting nearly, he moved up the Lake to "Draper's Landing."
Running the knot of some canoe upon the log, which was excessively on the level with the water,

some unsmooth of the waves caused the boat to work off, and before
he could return she had drifted well around on the floating waters
of the Lake.

We were pretty difficult to realize our situation.



Florine quitted the mansion and crossed the park to regain the summer house, while Mrs Grivois
went immediately to the Princess Saint-Dizier.
