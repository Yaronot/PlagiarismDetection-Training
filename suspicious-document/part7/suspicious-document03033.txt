Most men, finding themselves the authors of their own disgrace, rail the louder against God
or destiny. Most men, when they repent, oblige their friends to share the bitterness of that
repentance.

 But it is by no means in the way of every one to fall in love....A
wet rag goes safely by the fire; and if a man is blind, he cannot expect to be much impressed
by romantic scenery. Apart from all this, many lovable people miss each other in the world,
or meet under some unfavourable star.

*****

To deal plainly, if they only married when they fell in love, most people would die unwed;
and among the others, there would be not a few tumultuous households. The Lion is the King
of Beasts, but he is scarcely suitable for a domestic pet. In the same way, I suspect love
is rather too violent a passion to make, in all cases, a good domestic sentiment. Like other
violent excitements, it throws up not only what is best, but what is worst and smallest, in
men's characters. Just as some people are malicious in drink, or brawling and virulent under
the influence of religious feeling, some are moody, jealous, and exacting when they are in
love, who are honest, downright, good-hearted fellows enough in the everyday affairs and humours
of the world.

*****

There is only one event in life which really astonishes a man and startles him out of his prepared
opinions. Everything else befalls him very much as he expected. Event succeeds to event, with
an agreeable variety indeed, but with little that is either startling or intense; they form
together no more than a sort of background, or running accompaniment to the man's own reflections;
and he falls naturally into a cool, curious, and smiling habit of mind, and builds himself
up in a conception of life which expects to-morrow to be after the pattern of to-day and yesterday.
He may be accustomed to the vagaries of his friend and acquaintances under the influence of
love. He may sometime look forward to it for himself with an incomprehensible expectation.
But it is a subject in which neither intuition nor the behaviour of others will help the philosopher
to the truth. There is probably nothing rightly thought or rightly written on this matter of
love that is not a piece of the person's experience.

*****

It is the property of things seen for the first time, or for the first time after long, like
the flowers in spring, to re-awaken in us the sharp edge of sense, and that impression of mystic
strangeness which otherwise passes out of life with the coming years; but the sight of a loved
face is what renews a man's character from the fountain upwards.

*****

Nothing is given for nothing in this world; there can be no true love, even on your own side,
without devotion; devotion is the exercise of love, by which it grows; but if you will give
enough of that, if you will pay the price in a sufficient 'amount of what you call life,' why
then, indeed, whether with wife or comrade, you may have months and even years of such easy,
natural, pleasurable, and yet improving intercourse as shall make time a moment and kindness
a delight.

*****

Love is not blind, nor yet forgiving. 'O yes, believe me,' as the song says, 'Love has eyes!'
The nearer the intimacy, the more cuttingly do we feel the unworthiness of those we love; and
because you love one, and would die for that love to-morrow, you have not forgiven, and you
never will forgive that friend's misconduct. If you want a person's faults, go to those who
love him. They will not tell you, but they know. And herein lies the magnanimous courage of
love, that it endures this knowledge without change.

*****

Certainly, whatever it may be with regard to the world at large, this idea of beneficent pleasure
is true as between the sweethearts. To do good and communicate is the lover's grand intention.
It is the happiness of the other that makes his own most intense gratification. It is not possible
to disentangle the different emotions, the pride, humility, pity, and passion, which are excited
by a look of happy love or an unexpected caress. To make one's self beautiful, to dress the
hair, to excel in talk, to do anything and all things that puff out the character and attributes
and make them imposing in the eyes of others, is not only to magnify one's self, but to offer
the most delicate homage at the same time. And it is in this latter intention that they are
done by lovers, for the essence of love is kindness; and, indeed, it may be best defined as
passionate kindness; kindness, so to speak, run mad and become importunate and violent.

*****

What sound is so full of music as one's own name uttered for the first time in the voice of
her we love!

*****

We make love, and thereby ourselves fall the deeper in it. It is with the heart only that one
captures a heart.

*****

O, have it your own way; I am too old a hand to argue with young gentlemen who choose to fancy
themselves in love; I have too much experience, thank you.

*****

And love, considered as a spectacle, must have attractions for many who are not of the confraternity.
The sentimental old maid is a commonplace of the novelists; and he must be rather a poor sort
of human being, to be sure, who can look on at this pretty madness without indulgence and sympathy. But
those unconnected, unset audio are nothing to the maliciousness of music. A carpenter'mho cock,
into a passive summer noon, you will fret me to more while midsummer insanity. The ear is mensural
in those double strokes; willingly enduring battles, than it hath
no task to con.

*****

Jealousy, at any rate, is one of the consequences of love; you may like it or not, at pleasure;
but there it is.
