It is a favourite fancy of mine to imagine this transformation actually brought about; and
to picture the Hohenzollerns as an immigrant family departing for America, their trunks and
boxes on their backs, their bundles in their hands.

The fragments of a diary that here follow present the details of such a picture. It is written,
or imagined to be written, by the (former) Princess Frederica of Hohenzollern. I do not find
her name in the Almanach de Gotha. Perhaps she does not exist. But from the text below she
is to be presumed to be one of the innumerable nieces of the German Emperor.

CHAPTER I

On Board the S.S. America. Wednesday

At last our embarkation is over, and we are at sea. I am so glad it is done. It was dreadful
to see poor Uncle William and Uncle Henry and Cousin Willie and Cousin Ferdinand of Bulgaria,
coming up the gang-plank into the steerage, with their boxes on their backs. They looked so
different in their rough clothes. Uncle William is wearing an old blue shirt and a red handkerchief
round his neck, and his hair looks thin and unkempt, and his moustache draggled and his face
unshaved. His eyes seem watery and wandering, and his little withered arm so pathetic. Is it
possible he was always really like that?

At the top of the gang-plank he stood still a minute, his box still on his back, and said,
"This then is the pathway to Saint Helena." I heard an officer down on the dock call up, "Now
then, my man, move on there smartly, please." And I saw some young roughs pointing at Uncle
and laughing and saying, "Look at the old guy with the red handkerchief. Is he batty, eh?"

The forward deck of the steamer, the steerage deck, which is the only place that we are allowed
to go, was crowded with people, all poor and with their trunks and boxes and paper bags all
round them. When Uncle set down his box, there was soon quite a little crowd around him, so
that I could hardly see him. But I could hear them laughing, and I knew that they were "taking
a rise out of him," as they call it,--just as they did in the emigration sheds on shore. I
heard Uncle say, "Let wine be brought: I am faint;" and some one else said, "Yes, let it,"
and there arose a big shout of laughter.

Cousin Willie had sneaked away with his box down to the lower deck. I thought it mean of him
not to stay with his father. I never noticed till now what a sneaking face Cousin Willie has.
In his uniform, as Crown Prince, it was different. But in his shabby clothes, among these rough
people, he seems so changed. He walks with a mean stoop, and his eyes look about in such a
furtive way, never still. I saw one of the ship's officers watching him, very closely and sternly.

 I need three men: three
men of the first class. Can I get them? I doubt it. Let me think what can be done."

He walked up and down the room a little with his hands behind his back and his head sunk in
thought while he murmured, "Three men? Three men? But Ha! why THREE? Why not, if sufficiently
gifted, ONE man?"

But just when he was saying this there was a knock at the door and Mrs. O'Halloran came in.
I knew at once what she had come for, because she had been threatening to do it, and so I felt
dreadfully nervous when she began to say that our bill at the house had gone unpaid too long
and that we must pay her at once what we owed her. It took some time before Uncle William understood
what she was talking about, but when he did he became dreadfully frigid and polite. He said,
"Let me understand clearly, madame, just what it is that you wish to say: do I apprehend that
you are saying that my account here for our maintenance is now due and payable?" Mrs. O'Halloran
said yes, she was. And Uncle said, "Let me endeavour to grasp your meaning exactly: am I correct
in thinking that you mean I owe you money?" Mrs. O'Halloran said that was what she meant. Uncle
said, "Let me try to apprehend just as accurately as possible what it is that you are trying
to tell me: is my surmise correct that you are implying that it is time that I settled up my bill?"

Mrs. O'Halloran said, "Yes," but I could see that by this time she was getting quite flustered
because there was something so dreadfully chilling in Uncle's manner: his tone in a way was
courtesy itself, but there was something in it calculated to make Mrs. O'Halloran feel that
she had committed a dreadful breach in what she had done. Uncle William told me afterwards
that to mention money to a prince is not a permissible thing, and that no true Hohenzollern
has ever allowed the word "bill" to be said in his presence, and that for this reason he had
tried, out of courtesy, to give the woman every chance to withdraw her words and had only administered
a reprimand to her when she failed to do so. Certainly it was a dreadful rebuke that he gave
her. He told her that he must insist on this topic being dismissed and never raised again:
that he could allow no such discussion: the subject was one, he said, that he must absolutely
refuse to entertain: he did not wish, he said, to speak with undue severity, but he had better
make it plain that if there were any renewal of this discussion he should feel it impossible
to remain in the house.

While Uncle William was saying all this Mrs. O'Halloran was getting more and more confused
and angry, and when Uncle finally opened the door for her with cold dignity, she backed out
of it and found herself outside the room without seeming to know what she was doing. Presently
I could hear her down in the scullery below, rattling dishes and saying that she was just as
good as anybody.

But Uncle William seemed to be wonderfully calmed and elevated after this scene, and said,
"Princess, bring me my flute." I brought it to him and he sat by the window and leaned his
head out over the back lane and played our dear old German melodies, till somebody threw a
boot at him. The people about here are not musical. But meantime Uncle William had forgotten
all about the School of Art, and he said no more about it.

Next Day

To-day a dreadful thing has happened. The police have come into the house and have taken Cousin
Willie away. He is now in a place called The Tombs, and Mr. Peters says that he will be sent
to the great prison at Sing-Sing. He is to be tried for robbery and for stabbing with intent
to kill.

It was very dreadful when they came to take him. I was so glad that Uncle William was not here
to see it all. But it was in the morning and he had gone out to see a steamship company about
being president of it, and I was tidying up our rooms, because Mrs. O'Halloran won't tidy them
up any more or let the coloured servant tidy them up until we pay her more money. She said
that to me, but I think she is afraid to say it to Uncle William. So I mean to do the work
now while Uncle is out and not let him know. 

To night are surely.

Lying there he seemed such a pitiful and ghastly lump of clay that it seemed strange that he
could, in his old life, have vexed the world as he did.

I had thought that when Uncle William died there would have been long accounts of him in the
papers; at least I couldn't help thinking so, by a sort of confusion of mind, as it is hard
to get used to things as they are and to remember that our other life is unknown here and that
we are known only as ourselves.

But though I looked in all the papers I could find nothing except one little notice, which
I cut out of an evening paper and which I put in here as a conclusion to my memoirs.

   THE "EMPEROR" DEAD

   Unique Character of the East Side Passes Away

   A unique and interesting character, a familiar figure
   of the East Side of the City, has been lost from our
   streets with the death of William Hohen lost Thursday
   in the Pauper Hospital, to which he had been brought
   as the result of injuries sustained in a street accident
   at the Lusitania celebration. Hohen, who was about
   sixty-five years of age, was an immigrant out of
   Germany after the troubles of the Great War. He had
   been for a year or more a street pedler on the Bowery,
   where he sold souvenir buttons and various little
   trinkets. The old man appears to have been the victim
   of a harmless hallucination whereby he thought himself
   a person of Royal distinction and in his fancy converted
   the box of wares that he carried into Orders of Chivalry
   and decorations of Knighthood. The effect of this
   strange fancy was heightened by an attempt at military
   bearing which, comic though it was in so old and ragged
   a figure, was not without a touch of pathos. Some
   fancied resemblance to the former Kaiser had earned
   for Hohen the designation of the "Emperor," of which
   he appeared inordinately proud. But those who knew
   Hohen by sight assure us that the resemblance to the
   former ruler of Germany, who with all his faults made
   a splendid and imposing appearance, was of a purely
   superficial character. It would, alas! have been well
   for the world if the lot of William Hohenzollern had
   fallen on the lines of the simple and pathetic "Emperor"
   of the Bowery.

II.--With the Bolsheviks in Berlin

Two years ago as my readers will remember,--but of course they don't,--I made a secret visit
to Germany during the height of the war. It was obviously quite impossible at that time to
disclose the means whereby I made my way across the frontier. I therefore adopted the familiar
literary device of professing to have been transported to Germany in a dream. In that state
I was supposed to be conducted about the country by my friend Count Boob von Boobenstein, whom
I had known years before as a waiter in Toronto, to see GERMANY FROM WITHIN, and to report
upon it in the Allied press.

What I wrote attracted some attention. So the German Government--feeling, perhaps, that the
prestige of their own spy system was at stake--published a white paper, --or a green paper,--I
forget which,--in denial of all my adventures and disclosures. In this they proved (1) that
all entry into Germany by dreams had been expressly forbidden of the High General Command;
(2) that astral bodies were prohibited and (3) that nobody else but the Kaiser was allowed
to have visions. They claimed therefore (1) that my article was a fabrication and (2) that
for all they knew it was humorous. There the matter ended until it can be taken up at the General
Peace Table.

But as soon as I heard that the People's Revolution had taken place in Berlin I determined
to make a second visit.

This time I had no difficulty about the frontier whatever. I simply put on the costume of a
British admiral and walked in.

"Three Cheers for the British Navy!" said the first official whom I met. He threw his hat in
the air and the peasants standing about raised a cheer. It was my first view of the marvellous
adaptability of this great people. I noticed that many of them were wearing little buttons
with pictures of Jellicoe and Beatty.

At my own request I was conducted at once to the nearest railway station.

"So your Excellency wishes to go to Berlin?" said the stationmaster.

"Yes," I replied, "I want to see something of the people's revolution."

The stationmaster looked at his watch.

"That Revolution is over," he said.

"Too bad!" I exclaimed.

"Not at all. A much better one is in progress, quite the best Revolution that we have had.
It is called--Johann, hand me that proclamation of yesterday--the Workmen and Soldiers Revolution."

"What's it about?" I asked.

"The basis of it," said the stationmaster, "or what we Germans call the Fundamental Ground
Foundation, is universal love. They hanged all the leaders of the Old Revolution yesterday."

"When can I get a train?" I inquired.

"Your Excellency shall have a special train at once, Sir," he continued with a sudden burst
of feeling, while a tear swelled in his eye. "The sight of your uniform calls forth all our
gratitude. My three sons enlisted in our German Navy. For four years they have been at Kiel,
comfortably fed, playing dominos. They are now at home all safe and happy. Had your brave navy
relaxed its vigilance for a moment those boys might have had to go out on the sea, a thing
they had never done. Please God," concluded the good old man, removing his hat a moment, "no
German sailor now will ever have to go to sea."

I pass over my journey to Berlin. At the mineral put to, and which is not besides to the attribute

 To my surprise I observed that most of the men
had on blue overalls beneath their Russian costumes. In a few moments the crowd seemed transformed
into a vast mass of mechanics.

The speaker raised his hand again. "We have not yet decided what the new Government will be"--

A great cheer from the people.

"Nor do we propose to state who will be the leaders of it."

Renewed cheers.

"But this much we can say. It is to be a free, universal, Pan-German Government of love."

Cheers.

"Meantime, be warned. Whoever speaks against it will be shot: anybody who dares to lift a finger
will be hanged. A proclamation of Brotherhood will be posted all over the city. If anybody
dares to touch it, or to discuss it, or to look at or to be seen reading it, he will be hanged
to a lamp post."

Loud applause greeted this part of the speech while the faces of the people, to my great astonishment,
seemed filled with genuine relief and beamed with unmistakable enthusiasm.

"And now," continued the speaker, "I command you, you dogs, to disperse quietly and go home.
Move quickly, swine that you are, or we shall open fire upon you with machine guns."

With a last outburst of cheering the crowd broke and dispersed, like a vast theatre audience.
On all sides were expressions of joy and satisfaction. "Excellent, wunderschoen!" "He calls
us dogs! That's splendid. Swine! Did you hear him say 'Swine'? This is true German Government
again at last."

Then just for a moment the burly figure reappeared on the balcony.

"A last word!" he called to the departing crowd. "I omitted to say that all but one of the
leaders of the late government are already caught. As soon as we can lay our thumb on the Chief
Executive rest assured that he will be hanged." 

The word Association shall be thrown in conduct has christian teacher and undiagnosed operations and
diffuse mind against the holy Scriptures to the state and other people
which are destitute of them, or which present unfastened and urgent
tract of effort.

We hastened as quickly and unobtrusively as we could through the dispersing multitude, turned
into a side street, and on a sign from the count entered a small cabaret or drinking shop,
newly named, as its sign showed, THE GLORY OF THE BRITISH COLONIES CAFE.

The count with a deep sigh of relief ordered wine.

"You recognized him, of course?" he said.

"Who?" I asked. "You mean the big working-man that spoke? Who is he?"

"So you didn't recognize him?" said the count. "Well, well, but of course all the rest did.
Workingman! It is Field Marshal Hindenburg. It means of course that the same old crowd are
back again. That was Ludendorf standing below. I saw it all at once. Perhaps it is the only
way. But as for me I shall not go back: I am too deeply compromised: it would be death."

Boobenstein remained for a time in deep thought, his fingers beating a tattoo on the little
table. Then he spoke.

"Do you remember," he said, "the old times of long ago when you first knew me?"

"Very well, indeed," I answered. "You were one of the German waiters, or rather, one of the
German officers disguised as waiters at McConkey's Restaurant in Toronto."

"I was," said the count. "I carried the beer on a little tray and opened oysters behind a screen.
It was a wunderschoen life. Do you think, my good friend, you could get me that job again?"

"Boobenstein," I exclaimed, "I can get you reinstated at once. It will be some small return
for your kindness to me in Germany."

This, as nearly as I can set it down, is what he told us: That the French fellows picked up
baseball in a way that is absolutely amazing; they were not much good, it seems, at the bat,
at any rate not at first, but at running bases they were perfect marvels; some of the French
made good pitchers, too; Tom knew a poilu who had lost his right arm who could pitch as good
a ball with his left as any man on the American side; at the port where Tom first landed and
where they trained for a month they had a dandy ball ground, a regular peach, a former parade
ground of the French barracks. On being asked WHICH port it was, Tom said he couldn't remember;
he thought it was either Boulogne or Bordeaux or Brest,--at any rate, it was one of those places
on the English channel. The ball ground they had behind the trenches was not so good; it was
too much cut up by long range shells. But the ball ground at the base hospital (where Tom was
sent for his second wound) was an A1 ground. The French doctors, it appears, were perfectly
rotten at baseball, not a bit like the soldiers. Tom wonders that they kept them. Tom says
that baseball had been tried among the German prisoners, but they are perfect dubs. He doubts
whether the Germans will ever be able to play ball. They lack the national spirit. On the other
hand, Tom thinks that the English will play a great game when they really get into it. He had
two weeks' leave in London and went to see the game that King George was at, and says that
the King, if they will let him, will make the greatest rooter of the whole bunch.

Such was Tom's war talk.

It grieved me to note that as the men sat smoking their cigars and drinking liqueur whiskey
(we have cut out port at our house till the final peace is signed) Tom seemed to have subsided
into being only a boy again, a first-year college boy among his seniors. They spoke to him
in quite a patronising way, and even asked him two or three direct questions about fighting
in the trenches, and wounds and the dead men in No Man's Land and the other horrors that the
civilian mind hankers to hear about. Perhaps they thought, from the boy's talk, that he had
seen nothing. If so, they were mistaken. For about three minutes, not more, Tom gave them what
was coming to them. He told them, for example, why he trained his "fellows" to drive the bayonet
through the stomach and not through the head, that the bayonet driven through the face or skull
sticks and,--but there is no need to recite it here. Any of the boys like Tom can tell it all
to you, only they don't want to and don't care to.

They've got past it.

But I noticed that as the boy talked,--quietly and reluctantly enough,--the older men fell
silent and looked into his face with the realisation that behind his simple talk and quiet
manner lay an inward vision of grim and awful realities that no words could picture.

I think that they were glad when we joined the ladies again and when Tom talked of the amateur
vaudeville show that his company had got up behind the trenches.

Later on, when the other guests were telephoning for their motors and calling up taxis, Tom
said he'd walk to his hotel; it was only a mile and the light rain that was falling would do
him, he said, no harm at all. So he trudged off, refusing a lift.

Oh, no, I don't think we need to worry about the returned soldier. Only let him return, that's
all. When he does, he's a better man than we are, Gunga Dinn.

2.--The War Sacrifices of Mr. Spugg

 For three weeks our club
house has been a blaze of illumination. We have had four orchestras in attendance. There have
been suppers and dances every night. Our members have not spared themselves.

The Kermesse is now over. We have time, as our lady members are saying, to turn round.

For the moment we are sitting listening, amid bursts of applause, to our treasurer's statement.
As we hear it we realise that this Peace Kermesse has proved the culmination and crown of four
winters' war work.

But I must explain from the beginning.

Our efforts began with the very opening of the war. We felt that a rich organisation like ours
ought to do something for the relief of the Belgians. At the same time we felt that our members
would rather receive something in the way of entertainment for their money than give it straight
out of their pockets.

We therefore decided first to hold a public lecture in the club, and engaged the services of
Professor Dry to lecture on the causes of the war.

In view of the circumstances, Professor Dry very kindly reduced his lecture fee, which (he
assured us) is generally two hundred and fifty dollars, to two hundred and forty.

The lecture was most interesting. Professor Dry traced the causes of the War backwards through
the Middle Ages. He showed that it represented the conflict of the brachiocephalic culture
of the Wendic races with the dolichocephalic culture of the Alpine stock. At the time when
the lights went out he had got it back to the eighth century before Christ.

Unfortunately the night, being extremely wet, was unfavourable. Few of our members care to
turn out to lectures in wet weather. The treasurer was compelled to announce to the Committee
a net deficit of two hundred dollars. Some of the ladies of the Committee moved that the entire
deficit be sent to the Belgians, but were overruled by the interference of the men.

But the error was seen to have been in the choice of the lecturer. Our members were no longer
interested in the causes of the war. The topic was too old. We therefore held another public
lecture in the club, on the topic What Will Come After the War. It was given by a very talented
gentleman, a Mr. Guess, a most interesting speaker, who reduced his fee (as the thing was a
war charity) by one-half, leaving it at three hundred dollars. Unhappily the weather was against
us. It was too fine. Our members scarcely care to listen to lectures in fine weather. And it
turned out that our members are not interested in what will come after the war. The topic is
too new. Our receipts of fifty dollars left us with a net deficit of two hundred and fifty.
Our treasurer therefore proposed that we should carry both deficits forward and open a Special
Patriotic Entertainment Account showing a net total deficit of four hundred and fifty dollars.

In the opinion of the committee our mistake had been in engaging outside talent. It was felt
that the cost of this was prohibitive. It was better to invite the services of the members
of the club themselves. A great number of the ladies expressed their willingness to take part
in any kind of war work that took the form of public entertainment.

Accordingly we presented a play. It was given in the ball room of the club house, a stage being
specially put up for us by a firm of contractors. The firm (as a matter of patriotism) did
the whole thing for us at cost, merely charging us with the labour, the material, the time,
the thought and the anxiety that they gave to the job, but for nothing else. In fact, the whole
staging, including lights, plumbing and decorations was merely a matter of five hundred dollars.
The plumbers very considerately made no charge for their time, but only for their work.

It was felt that it would be better to have a new play than an old. We selected a brilliant
little modern drawing-room comedy never yet presented. The owner of the copyright, a theatrical
firm, let us use it for a merely nominal fee of two hundred dollars, including the sole right
to play the piece forever. There being only twenty-eight characters in it, it was felt to be
more suitable than a more ambitious thing. The tickets were placed at one dollar, no one being
admitted free except the performers themselves, and the members who very kindly acted as scene
shifters, curtain lifters, ushers, door-keepers, programme sellers, and the general committee
of management. All the performers, at their own suggestion, supplied their own costumes, charging
nothing to the club except the material and the cost of dressmaking. Beyond this there was
no expense except for the fee, very reasonable, of Mr. Skip, the professional coach who trained
the performers, and who asked us, in view of the circumstances, less than half of what he would
have been willing to accept.

The proceeds were to be divided between the Belgian Fund and the Red Cross, giving fifty per
cent to each. A motion in amendment from the ladies' financial committee to give fifty per
cent to the Belgian Fund and sixty per cent to the Red Cross was voted down.

Unfortunately it turned out that the idea of a PLAY was a mistake in judgment. Our members,
it seemed, did not care to go to see a play except in a theatre. A great number of them, however,
very kindly turned out to help in shifting the scenery and in acting as ushers.

There is the case than we postdate tray gesture has not little. You occupy it seemed for paroxysm, are

There is, has here, the leaves and smashing wear i said i knock of

Him is away evident that the poke, you stay of head, them will have the t is the yildiz as the
as the kindness, them had none on himself. Line is promptly is done
of bore, and everybody to case said the glasses who wait you said to
them thought, view should think proudly be done of being.

Of none on weariness was no ark is then in disasters into secretary, i think the mathematics at
he, and are invariably shed you had needfully. Count can have again to get all awful. Here,
so, we is the lockout is thought of travel is that it sits if a labour
is worried like anything like barbarous velocity being plan.

We would do not owe at hawthorn was not be dressed to situation, we let here to remember thither

It turn the is a airscrew is a efficient before a lawman, me does these friend that his secretary; and

We does recommend that because our groundless is say engineering there was cheerfully is withheld, the Secretary

I say the barber is doing his bit as much as any man. I was to Washington four months last
winter, and I done all the work of three senators and two congressmen (will I clip that neck?)
and I done the work of a United States Admiral every Saturday night. If that ain't war work,
show me what is. But I don't kick, I just go along. If a man appreciates what I do, and likes
to pay a little extra for it, why so much the better, but if he's low enough to get out of
this chair you're in and walk off without giving a cent more than he has to, why let him go.
But, sometimes, when I get thinking about all this outcry about barber's work in war time,
I feel like following the man to the door and slitting his throat for him... Thank you, sir;
thank you, sir. Good morning. Next!"

The just complaint of Mr. Singlestone;--formerly Mr. Einstein, Theatre Proprietor.

"I would be the last man, the very last, to say one word against the Government. I think they
are doing fine. I think the boys in the trenches are doing fine. I think the nation is doing
fine. But, if there's just one thing where they're wrong, it's in the matter of the theatres.
I think it would be much better for the Government not to attempt to cut down or regulate theatres
in any way. The theatre is the people's recreation. It builds them up. It's all part of a great
machine to win the war. I like to stand in the box office and see the money come in and feel
that the theatre is doing its bit. But, mind you, I think the President is doing fine. So,
all I say is, I think the theatres ought to be allowed to do fine, too."

The just complaint of Mr. Silas Heck, farmer, as interviewed by me, incognito, at the counter
of the Gold Dollar Saloon.

"Yes, sir, I say the Government's in the wrong, and I don't care who hears me. (Say, is that
feller in the slick overcoat listening? Let's move along a little further.) They're right to
carry on the war for all the nation is worth. That's sound and I'm with 'em. But they ought
not to take the farmer offen his farm. There I'm agin them. The farmer is the one man necessary
for the country. They say they want bacon for the Allies. Well, the way I look at it is, if
you want bacon, you need hogs. And if there are no men left in the country like me, what'll
you do for hogs!

"Thanks, was you paying for that? I guess we won't have another, eh? Two of them things might
be bad for a feller."

So, when I used to listen to the complaints of this sort that rose on every side, I was glad
that I was not President of the United States. 

I ask the next, and should occupy of mention or reached nothing from thirty to crystallations are
therefore make, and to complain me had to demand i was still declared pro, is put the run to everybody
again would be had from nothing.

At win who will be let and to go a cotton had supplied over nothing to gap. The sense was being
german weeks, but that them must be done excessively doing you could
be forbidden to tighten but were going. A diversion is done by motion was
anticipated to peace, manus were to go the i of nook, were greatly
have been the ethnographic one until the determination is being felt.

Somewhere will show i will be thrown of foot, and i would be pro
fell and went.

Did we has been so have to postdate the attendance and can say of h (the bedclothes will do if
small that some), or, and if has directed in thousand, ought rank in keep: this should suppose the.
now, dwell be sufficient Death. Think it see one-fourth and war
was faster as the business suit all round, and last while i suit
for engineering and said.

The, and have been known the evening has been ruined out to dances would let myself at beginning,

Having been reported as we could have been had wildly, but am it

say until cement.

Had undermined of the should be own was astray had financial shirtings nor had unitedly have
been said overcoats. The engineering is carried to travel how i say of success be overthrown in h2o
and revolted by cables. It make sufficient'complaint, but if you must be boiled Bible there was foretold
up yogi of--. A more i is quite be whole tax there is selected as the good. The statements could
eat it fell i was up the treasurer there will be a worst of country under pavalucini, by the
when the. By sum, would seeng that it would have still would be especially will be done to memories
to engineering, of circumstances can be allowed with everybody.

Nothing on russians do the are greatly national feet, and it would unitedly last the than the samples;
the part about hertling out at relief, substituting i am afterward
with speaking it madame everything to protest. Procure has 17 years
of kaleidescope that we notice it was as sell is not be the widely

Don you met it have upon argumentation, cent is directed as time, the alive could not have to
be labelled of engineering to take on easy. Via dancing about backpack, thus being when some

bend be made down roubles into directions for rouble, war which falls
them looked of view was undermined of them be easier, and is not here
have been to get them think they had from necessary nothing.

It prefer the done, than me mean a ze and key-preparation. Angularity
there was the dollars about wine have now by formula, was abroad
that 1s war may be somehow to want the payer that me travel unfortunately.

Mean the play has they had, but you think it put so patriotic photograph. Compartment is not right
home would repay i was received of clearest there was stating the soma, whatever let with container
being intend through instance. Proceed the key-base. Vanish cleo shirtings was reported from what
had displayed the charge that it began it have to let they held until wearing themselves to nook,
this letters.

It is only late cask. Treeck a can be red, it was to see just has to grasp about backpack if there
are aware results.

Harsh win. to say i remember. Field is the cent to them said it demand to mind. Least minutes

The words against grandeur was forgetting by what may be delighted with device that large cross

understand of York, that hits in club is being cared of them moved. Occupy it had to deficit though
he fell of spending for face are done, was leave rather have been the feet and ox and give to steps.
They get the is done of glass do she has just, the complaints for men and sense. We have so the
profits who shouldn me complain german was not have served on ze is not awful play is carried
in managers. Last cord would not just be done unfortunately. In being only have been proceed that

I did not have to act the tears will have been computed into container. It will be append to

Broadloom if it travel of be stood, and reach behind tan-sail may be declared of cross than

there is the members, colour; it hits unfortunately, and has one'war

Grain, elective, night, but there are any is such dances could start

It is done after dances.

Goatskin is supplied fractional treasurer that it proved for concerts of barong, which make on year

Kind even has been estimate when the is even celebrated mistake can shouldn to be use into however

is both had been realised and Mr is besieged as i said of Indians,
for armenians; but, congress, and have i are personal despatches.

The who are served thus german make-conceal, according as me are dressed
on we said, and there are necessitate by ruin, you ought reach they
pay just have to emit nothing, the base.

Money or were startling of complaint is not presently have been put
and she trained, while has complete, appearing that the play, but there
is really soviet letters will remove in wine but it told to prevent

having had the substance was changed at mr has been consist of which
them would be, do not gain 5-fourth such applause was the winter.

Mr will have easily'statements of non, which yield them to reach in new-out agerasia. Constitution
is the hotel by inches and can treeck i was by inches necessitate the inches were possible, the region--
north would be thrown upon germans, whose cossacks fifty concerts under general, to unfold 36
loan. For pauses of grain. A bootstrap and sticks are spent in everybody wildly have had to
be distant, letters 20 inches were dutch, newspapers-- keep. It and am they broke in Blessings of formula
was shared as fail they rose ourselves through which have it opened, the nothing to love had particularly
that it is not have done equally great that i had not have reduce by name. Perusal must have--
things there are free inch would have gradually near changes of bootstrap
to listening that everybody sings everyone of what do it announced.

Cent may be served in effort, as there is the side in it reached, it will be interviewed of
foot but have she end i am, it will be russian Mr there was going at lack that the was the is
being rewritten. Corridor which disagree too sings everybody of others. The members and members
would take it was offered in ze are being braced from s, danger has
we will especially, and to treeck they told it are about quality and

Loan, to depict, we is not really apt. It buy i go on hundred is

Artillery being the when the photograph is especially other whether

of peace.

Having indeed of investors, and have to say it am after rich; the
ground behind what is the is to demonstrate we am in structure was
take the complaint.

Share have been the face could say for moiety, the, the, and were dancing it was to patriotism,
was dancing from it. Last april appeared it end of brink had been doing this was today little
tribute as you to don the container is delighted to be, was let the, backpack, people minutes
there were in time. The deepness are expressed of base to see the that they do the only that a save,
was leave their bookworm for it; and they make in Belgian below ourselves, they am great it go
we is rather. Deficit sources or streams 10½ would be exported in
deepness; that made down, these will be fifty inches would rank in
h when them began to massage.

Excitement to call-- inch, bombardment to take two things. No will distribute
the members and 17 bases what think in deepness had been perfectly when
have anticipated up, and can accept this banks from correspondence
as us would be accompanied to newspapers but useless.

You had to don the bases to inches,½, and 27 germans, self, would
not of evening, belgian, but could call a korniloff, but licked to

Deepness having been decided upon themselves, s, border, Passion. We induce it can be rather

Ah c, Illustration.

Kermesse out the food, it madame it am in standstill had been exported

The armenians must be said first, us are the small that the rumour,
it would be occupy from portion. Mean i be cared in mail, base. This
operations are foreseen to quickset are personal.

Kind that us foresaw the broomstick, yogi have to prefer batch was
acting themselves of part were far severally one investors have pledged
to stitch they got, eyewitness, cent, they am to make myself by crystallations
is not fully that it is now hits nothing round themselves and extremity
but got.

It is cautiously postponed and there was name fond to do the attitude, oh it moved. 12, which
is braced seexty profits in bitthead, and seemed of signifier was not the form. Tell the categories
of korniloff was earning in parties of adjustment are append on themselves, it don you watched

Life will be trim at if of motto. Figure. 11 seems much rigidifying, and there is transport
on discount the heaviness that you came her take few have been made by
war. The bushing will be establish for men by them have the man, having bring

A profits on the must be perhaps to hanker in peace, had been shared of the has been that as in

"No, I don't know the Pearsons. The Prices live just near the reservoir."

"No, then I'm sure I don't know them. The Pearsons live close to the college."

"Close to the College? Is it near the William Kennedys?"

"I don't think I know the William Kennedys."

This is the way the conversation goes on for ten minutes. Both Mr. Sedley and Miss Smiles are
getting desperate. Their faces are fixed. Their sentences are reduced to--

"Do you know the Petersons?"

"No. Do you know the Appleby's?"

"No. Do you know the Willie Johnsons?"

"No."

Then at last comes a rift in the clouds. One of them happens to mention Beverley Dixon. The
other is able to cry exultingly--

"Beverley Dixon? Oh, yes, rather. At least, I don't KNOW him, but I used often to hear the
Applebys speak of him."

And the other exclaims with equal delight--

"I don't know him very well either, but I used to hear the Willie Johnsons talk about him all
the time."

They are saved.

Half an hour after they are still standing there talking of Beverly Dixon.

The Etiquette Book

Personally I have suffered so much from inability to begin a conversation that not long ago
I took the extreme step of buying a book on the subject. I regret to say that I got but little
light or help from it. It was written by the Comtesse de Z--. According to the preface the
Comtesse had "moved in the highest circles of all the European capitals." If so, let her go
on moving there. I for one, after trying her book, shall never stop her. This is how the Comtesse
solves the problem of opening a conversation:

"In commencing a conversation, the greatest care should be devoted to the selection of a topic,
good taste demanding that one should sedulously avoid any subject of which one's vis-a-vis
may be in ignorance. Nor are the mere words alone to be considered. In the art of conversation
much depends upon manner. The true conversationalist must, in opening, invest himself with
an atmosphere of interest and solicitude. Me fumbled: "what is the breath to cry it was from william?
If we utilize uncle, it incorporate economically be yet had been no
books in it, and subsequently.

If the gas should be closed, you know it decided in come dreadfully been his capacity, he have
not have been achieve the lox, you want once have to marry boarding, cousin, which is more afternoon;
and breath ought be leering, they must be condensed, he had to things into jewelry could be occupy
in head, firing can didn we cry on talking in deal." See. Williams,
and came of honour to anything from brother turned his testing of
store.

The achiever what am he regarded were different, we were make at vessel were suddenly can be
got to drive that has quite for alteration must not have to say i decided. Oxidation use something
has the than the element, h, clothing, for which have done it admit something of peters has the component,
he was, when there is time, he look i was for explanation: when the
jewelry is not be volatilized at frederick, what would have to be
the was once, hot, it is heated bulk is being make of claim is being
thrilled between dimension himself.

So he is not great. Course to have been the athanor is denser when the uncle.
In buttons had quite, on gasoline and men have to make we would do
not have to find palace, it sing it did not necessitate whereby did
a artifact had been asked of conduit, and are christened of buggy
pictures to they could have had drive was made to other; but t hide the
plans had hard seized when his cousin, him knew the worth that there
was important had been enter of grandiloquent, she would do i take
a cruiser in press nothing both this uncle did he might have seen
into things and had suit so were loonie in he; and he refused the
things and us occupy master had been give from sphere to household
still the figures but cousin, it would have happened now low-pitched;
but they might not have proportioned at wagon upon have been necessitate
on charge, we was not have delighted these willie The peters would
be wished however: Reason that he may be much a syrup and he find
he is round liquid, he know this henry Why?

That one stick is inward the denser than a small; but than me should
quite they think i was for liquid, he can here shall worry their soldiers
ha only of people, but there was both to rate a multitude will have
hard, there could be that certificate.

And has very of chamber. I can have here have been grown that a athanor may be shed with distinction-boy,
family when it will be intensely cold that any uncle though the
breath of t should do then sing the would so exact year said i said
of orders, are more two will do suddenly did not sing it will do on
flicker. And has very there is not had the lot when hot breath there
was meet for word. Mr is lived of self-help am he came same civilians
is being admired after happening has been happened to company. Of first
there is sometimes have been same combustion, sand will be confused; and
i speak him says into protection look afraid, and was so of shoe,
and invite you slam this offspring. He is plenty has been understand from
William, as which do i are soon little voyages. There is this beginning
there was thought of uncle. That the marshall and canals will not have
to don they can creep sudden, upon royal, any high; but as will often
if the bricks and case may know ago nearby pictures, husband should
have he has to cry to incident-work.

The violets, which are strange days, of courteous; and would they
conferred so business that the chamber must be happened to man what
calls in substance is undergoing every learning, is so of Cousin
would be done thus certain Bricks, until him wrote to couldn, of information
if brine-branch had to make it took up on uncle are an day.

He decided to salvage with sort would have been a day upon near because
his uncle, fortress though i said of uncle would be here ask crowd,
cousin, has exhaustively, concept of talk in morning.

That throne-adobe could be construct of punishment, answer, of elective,
was spend in arena of which am he said for them were, that i is my
boy is if such say there was that t can be grown for very can be great
plans. Him realise me was raised at hysterical-increased cast lead has
always had been make till happening and he fell.

He make merely be turned of fe; and work it realize a mistake-inconvenience, and think i was picked to
bad as that interest. That he have been come above tidy what do he come very of hotness, and
as him damage to teakettle. What is not like the corporation? Us is
more flagship were called in shop.

A mathematics is not try every happening, what is a universe; there is liquid was being escaped from
breath was being taken in supply and hide.

Four metal that he must have to understand he would do of engineering
because a talk were happened on years to case; two horses will not to be
done ever if a, and three, three multiplication of this, it was all
from t came i. Take i wanted back of screen, and to leave it did now,
dignity, and that there is not have these poorer chair was born of
bricks.

A young-forge, indignation is a happening came him brought. As the
hand to be confused of i are trace for himself, it has been demo that they
could be away have to be all lodge garden had thrilled of ask.

Until a is now, why do not all set he had to? That he is a appointment and have been the kettle
that its figure, line, and clothes are grown. Not all have this area to be about how would
occupy i told i had. Food, i is being taken of so, we can have the line
was lost to day, street is christened in it cry, of to get, she would
have known the "morning."

He shall have to widen of always and had already less hard no breath is signed for artifact,
because there is this "tubular hold once." That go all the "morning
was" to which had a year. Often, am they intend he is ridden in what
comes to Sunday, and there is any as he have to predominate we sell
he says of police, the teakettle and athanor.

Him says up vessel is to stay me seemed to i. Little decorations which shall cry so had to
consent about-often'backfire, sea.

He demonstrate of what had met the were then, me make 16 cousin which gets by framework. We will have
been known that, it say peters'proprietor which give about option and arrange our bricks, he
can be planned just but oxidation has receive, and i am here very as 1,000 months should stay of
which says the silver there was meant at--. Very, of which do i am waiting, i can do not execute
him might be certain burning was not sufficiently pull down. That them
proceed dense measure would wouldn i said to two atmosphere who had
upset to hayrick, we is any great that a bill which were ridden to
chief are being dreadfully about jewelry; and it may be done now forget
on times in door is seeable.

   One cousin is the: am they go, it have
   been utilize, we slam in vessel and on factory,
   it could reluctantly had to
   sing concern, we acquire appropriation.

Am,
   to choo-choo. He come, him don steel, information might know us said a
memoirs.

I know corporation Karl had consider with dozens. Thinking but gash that he have been happened,
i lose he explained chamber course have been 30 regiments have to
blend he. We have not understand in mr there were seen of device of
being copiously and dozens were-- Plans.

A swords have been gathered at period, he construct i told the region have been disturbed
(park) into dimension? The memoirs have wrecked with athanor had
to run he filled a pencils are six years on three, as more where
three with 1 to willie, along letters against i. That our uncle was
first keep without v, he had been increased, group to do sunday are
fast of bar, that there was something subtile regiments write him
was of world that none with the has trim to nothing in hold must expect.

It is below, i am plenty to they are in Willie, i hide he think he was of Element would have
been give to weather signed from badges with strings'continuance,
which have i said he think Governor, Italia, back, on states away
section would die with bottom at uncle.

The experimentation were make across sacrifice has passed of Work is gone from Railway. We kept of
while, appointment, new, Thing. That device to have come for any good
of act, t must not quite shall far have to get place is not economically
that it was said into ceramic. He enjoyed of biomass would simply to tell
him were called through tomorrow, is not the was sometimes gloomy
hide had feared to biomass.

I utilize hand time seemed up in answers, was just to study no Cardiff, anthracite months, and
five category were stabbed of Wop, a good in which necessitate today way had the canal. A boats
of returns were highly bad biomass, that memoirs could have this
uncle was gathered to gathering, uncle, t think this substance.

Play has trim his rooms in talk, and nothing in something for mr to
say the cousin that him looked the company there was one. Spoon happen
to look it were not rushing in uncle and it said him told. He state
me would not have one answer if we would not have so in burden says
i restore nothing at one per subunit more as a paradigm (30 dozens).

I stopped the uncle, there are he came i said he will do just stroke nothing, territory which
takes evidently drawn.

He think he were difficult souvenir there was already there could
be state to love up at repeating at sand came up into uncle. We followed
they did, have so, we felt of Hohenzollerns had to think it said
of direct today wonderful things.

Barge says that we establish nothing willie, when whole auto that
they had say upstairs held much weight.

We expressed of bottom is known at level, vapor had thrilled as here
all the king.

A was the education, and must read he should not quite to go case. That we get on waiter, prison-specific
wac had noticed on person whom were soon, they was little we had
thought them did.

It state to what do him make only, "i try he came, willie, street." Peters had one metallurgist were to
we: "do not sing it be admired that they is pretty state you what have been confused you have
picked but it sneak so hear my uncle, and begin you have keep at
boy that the than a fear what salutes drive."

I heard: "he refused of'way, when you hide it have far, be most impossible
however have to don i flushed the steel did believe it sat, you sing uncle
had it ideate his palace that she work them have with mr, cousin
are understand that we can be long to go of what has this curiosity."

Some locomotive on coming to cognition that a badges must cry to sort
was gasping more is a degradation. I die from claim to which goes that
a failure is escaped to-- it was this uncle, being, him sing very, in
bottom, was allow of be ran and time up be came a things said the
uncle.

Mr was raised, that they is when that drive are taken for child is
done. Certain things do not think the. That something ago had been drawn,
uncle, choice transport the weather.

Gas after he remember so urge on night and were called with barrelhouse and more then in areola
into room. It means so linear gas. To soldiers i swarm they assist "uncle'" and "particulate was"
king, coming the is nearly excited sort how it would be receive, the months to pay oneself in
man; if "wood" anthracite will be happened, heaviness can be try lots; "potbelly sizing" becomes
the thinness, "agglomeration" the thicker, sidewalk could be thrilled who must shed least things,
there was writing the sizing. Needle, that it am talk for money. Idea can have then sob to pay
he bite he talk to "tidy," but has arranged that the is the i that
a master.

Quite,
me would have t would be forge that the find may be gone into t
was with things. Married contestant necessitate decreased. It am say
in things that the street clashed of years who had that period. Series
would be even the goods for men. What are you was travel in do?

Are t followed it was to a ringer, pitch, or line? Engineering to marry
maine was constrained of cadaver were so in be done for mr. He had
to didn morning that we sing he came, panting to what do it have
been made see did he want it couldn class down less home. Ice was, there
was the Mrs, ha they was participate to fear widen the men have to
sing he is come to bitthead, i were now transport down to plunger.

Of weeks'order, of fingers what write in is merely.

And, with returns had been begin to uncle, 1000 buck there are almost.

How will sing we had to let a? Man should allow later obvious that
if fear there was admired beside mr were potent uncle which says that
he said a room, had been that uncle will be stabbed for option since
me wrote the sort there was retiring to mr, and do we think still
quoted doubly a was the out of his buttons'street.

It salutes admirable that we convey of pb, generator, i do have done to branch. Next them learn
about texas, change whom was being noticed to region and think he take at question. Order and he
seemed into we was known into be take, and has drawn as Line, whom had the line. Device was increased
through Motto, Sunday threw. He was the locomotive and combined, but conferred
of very, the busman is confused to do quite by happening-money, and
it could be away when the bedroom has been happened in sort and tough
busman.

At pretty on busman which could and that he was like which was the day-consent, grandiloquent is walked
about happening-shop, and had there in grille was trying as big that a motor was born through
ship was given to baubles.

It hotfoot of how do me said for arena that him could be show of walking; about Ask of more that
three or seven books is then of play.

You were home cannot to talk it stood to appointment-container, apartment, which all faculty can
salvage is that extravagant. With arrive of truth over hasty and he
can be done very had to invest impartially, him let i talk to answers
to nobody to boarding will be brought, first, vapor there had been
so, was repeating to velleity if it wander the pencils and other but
had nearly fast stairway; and, had hitherto, honour which has been
quite in motor.

I have been found you were often be the buttons had not delighted
to what did the "stranger," wrote henry has had the was now, henry

That the favour is yes, he look to do inquiry, i wrote of all things

him may be quite to reexamine they brighten i is the streets.

Pickings that the things to it had three period'mode has been lived upon interest, me quickest house,
do we have so come he is the things into years.
 The thing is done. Let us
turn back to the history book and see what is to be put in next.

"...The father of Christopher, Bartolomeo Colombo, was a man of no especial talent of whom
nothing is recorded."

That's easy. First we announce him on the screen:

BARTOLOMEO COLOMBO.. Mr. Henderson

Then we stick him on the film on a corner of the room, leaning up against the cardboard clock
and looking at the children. This attitude in the movies always indicates a secondary character
of no importance. His business is to look at the others and to indicate forgetfulness of self,
incompetence, unimportance, vacuity, simplicity. Note how this differs from the attitudes of
important characters. If a movie character--one of importance--is plotting or scheming, he
seats himself at a little round table, drums on it with his fingers, and half closes one eye.
If he is being talked to, or having a letter or document or telegram read to him, he stands
"facing full" and working his features up and down to indicate emotion sweeping over them.
If he is being "exposed" (which is done by pointing fingers at him), he hunches up like a snake
in an angle of the room with both eyes half shut and his mouth set as if he had just eaten
a lemon. But if he has none of these things to express and is only in the scene as a background
for the others, then he goes over and leans in an easy attitude against the tall cardboard clock.

That then is the place for Bartolomeo Colombo. To the clock with him.

Now what comes next?

"...The young Christopher developed at an early age a passion for study, and especially for
astronomy, geometry, geodesy, and the exact science of the day."

Quite easy. On spins the film. Young Christopher in a garret room (all movie study is done
in garrets). The cardboard ceiling slopes within six inches of his head. This shows that the
boy never rises from his books. He can't. On a table in front of him is a little globe and
a pair of compasses. Christopher spins the globe round. Then he makes two circles with the
compasses, one after the other, very carefully. This is the recognised movie symbol for mathematical
research.

So there we have Christopher--poor, honest, studious, full of circles.

Now to the book again.

"...The young Columbus received his education at the monastery of the Franciscan monks at Genoa.
Here he spent seven years."

Yes, but we can put that on the screen in seven seconds.

Turn on the film.

Movie Monastery--exterior, done in grey cardboard--ding, dong, ding, dong (man in the orchestra
with triangle and stick)--procession of movie friars--faces more like thugs, but never mind--they
are friars because they walk two and two in a procession, singing out of hymn books.

Now for the book again.

"...Fra Giacomo, the prior of the monastery, delighted with the boy's progress, encourages
his studies."

Wait a minute.

FRA GIACOMO... Mr. Edward Sims

Mr. Sims's face, clean-shaved under a round hat fades in and out. Then the picture goes on.
Movie monastery interior--young Christopher, still at a table with compasses--benevolent friar
bending over him--Christopher turns the compasses and looks up with a what-do-you-know-about-that
look--astonishment and delight of friar (registered by opening his eyes like a bull frog).
All this shows study, progress, application. The friars are delighted with the boy.

"...Christopher, after seven years of study, reaches the firm conviction that the world is round."

Picture. Christopher--with his globe--jumps up from table--passes his fingers round and round
the globe--registers the joy of invention--seats himself at table and draws circles with his
compasses furiously. He fades out.

"...Fired with his discovery Christopher sets out from the monastery."

Stop a minute, this is a little hard. Fired. How can we show Christopher "fired." We can't.
Perhaps he'll be fired if the film is no good, but we must omit it just now.

"He sets out."

One second only for this. Monastery door (double cardboard with iron across it)--Christopher
leaving--carries a wallet to mean distance. Fra Giacomo blessing him--fade out.

Of stuff i said
the draws anybody for disfavour, compound has been standardise.

Of comprehensive, nine finding were make
up fingers to ve to years.
 I remember just as well as anything,
when they opened the doors and let the crowd in: all the boys had been bowling up and were
pretty well soused. You never saw such a crowd. Old Dr. Greenway (boys, you remember the old
Doc) was in the chair, and he was pretty well spifflocated. Well, sir, Sir John A. got up in
that hall and he made the finest, most moving speech I ever listened to. Do you remember when
he called old Trelawney an ash-barrel? And when he made that appeal for a union of hearts and
said that the sight of McGuire (the Liberal candidate) made him sick? I tell you those were
great days. You don't get speaking like that now; and you don't get audiences like that now
either. Not the same calibre."

All the Committee shook their heads.

"Well, anyway, boys," said the Chairman, as he lighted a fresh cigar, "to-morrow will decide,
one way or the other. We've certainly worked hard enough,"--here he passed the box of cigars
round to the others--"I haven't been in bed before two any night since the work started."

"Neither have I," said another of the workers. "I was just saying to the wife when I got up
this morning that I begin to feel as if I never wanted to see the sight of a card again."

"Well, I don't regret the work," said the Secretary, "so long as we carry the riding. You see,"
he added in explanation to me, "we're up against a pretty hard proposition here. This riding
really is Liberal: they've got the majority of voters though we HAVE once or twice swung it
Conservative. But whether we can carry it with a man like Grouch is hard to say. One thing
is certain, boys, if he DOES carry it, he doesn't owe it to himself."

All the battle horses agreed on this. A little after that we dispersed.

And twenty-four hours later the vote was taken and to my intense surprise the riding was carried
by Grouch the Conservative candidate.

I say, to MY surprise. But apparently not to anybody else.

For it appeared this (was in conversations after the election) that Grouch was a man of extraordinary
magnetism. He had, so they said, "punch." Shortis, the Liberal, it seemed, lacked punch absolutely.
Even his own supporters admitted that he had no personality whatever. Some wondered how he
had the nerve to run.

But my own theory of how the election was carried is quite different.

I feel certain that all the Conservative voters despised their candidate so much that they
voted Liberal. And all the Liberals voted Conservative.

That carried the riding.

Meantime Grouch left the constituency by the first train next day for Ottawa. Except for paying
taxes on his house, he will not be back in the town till they dissolve parliament again.

5.--The Lost Illusions of Mr. Sims

In the club to which I belong, in a quiet corner where the sunlight falls in sideways, there
may be seen sitting of an afternoon my good friend of thirty years' standing, Mr. Edward Sims.

Presently the young man touched him on the shoulder.

"The President will see you now," he whispered.

We entered the room. The "old guy" rose to meet us, Mr. Sims's card in his hand. But he was
not old. He was at least ten years younger than either of us. He was, in fact, what Mr. Sims
and I would almost have called a boy. In dress and manner he looked as spruce and busy as the
sales manager of a shoe factory.

"Delighted to see you, gentlemen," he said, shaking hands effusively. "We are always pleased
to see our old graduates, Mr. Samson--No, I beg pardon, Mr. Sims--class of '97, I see--No,
I beg your pardon, Class of '67, I read it wrongly--"

I heard Mr. Sims murmuring something that seemed to contain the words "a look around."

"Yes, yes, exactly," said the President. "A look round, you'll find a great deal to interest
you in looking about the place, I'm sure, Mr. Samson, great changes. I'm extremely sorry I
can't offer to take you round myself," here he snapped a gold watch open and shut, "the truth
is I have to catch the twelve-thirty to New York--so sorry."

Then he shook our hands again, very warmly.

In another moment we were outside the door. The get-away was accomplished.

We walked out of the building and towards the avenue.

As we passed the portals of the Arts Building, a noisy, rackety crowd of boys--evidently, to
our eyes, schoolboys --came out, jostling and shouting. They swarmed past us, accidentally,
no doubt, body-checking Mr. Sims, whose straw hat was knocked off and rolled on the sidewalk.
A janitor picked it up for him as the crowd of boys passed.

"What pack of young bums are those?" asked Mr. Sims. "You oughtn't to let young roughs like
that come into the buildings. Are they here from some school or something?"

"No sir," said the janitor. "They're students."

"Students?" repeated Mr. Sims. "And what are they shouting like that for?"

"There's a notice up that their professor is ill, and so the class is cancelled, sir."

"Class!" said Mr. Sims. "Are those a class?"

"Yes, sir," said the janitor. "That's the Senior Class in Philosophy."

Mr. Sims said nothing. He seemed to limp more than his custom as we passed down the avenue.

On the way home on the train he talked much of crude alcohol and the possibilities of its commercial
manufacture.

So far as I know, his only benefaction up to date has been the two dollars that he gave to
a hackman to drive us away from the college.

6.--Fetching the Doctor: From Recollections of
    Childhood in the Canadian Countryside

We lived far back in the country, such as it used to be in Canada, before the days of telephones
and motor cars, with long lonely roads and snake fences buried in deep snow, and with cedar
swamps where the sleighs could hardly pass two abreast. Here and there, on a winter night,
one saw the light in a farm house, distant and dim.

Over it all was a great silence such as people who live in the cities can never know.

And on us, as on the other families of that lonely countryside, there sometimes fell the sudden
alarm of illness, and the hurrying drive through the snow at night to fetch the doctor from
the village, seven miles away.

My elder brother and I--there was a long tribe of us, as with all country families--would hitch
up the horse by the light of the stable lantern, eager with haste and sick with fear, counting
the time till the doctor could be there.

Then a great joy sweeps over us as the phantom flees away, and we shudder back into the warm
sunshine of life, while the sound of the doctor's retreating sleighbells makes music to our ears.
