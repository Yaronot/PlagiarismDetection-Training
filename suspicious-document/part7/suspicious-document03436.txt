Dec^r 24th.--Elder Whitwell told my aunt, that this winter began as did the Winter of 1740.
How that was I dont remember but this I know, that to-day is by far the coldest we have had
since I have been in New England. (N.B. All run that are abroad.) Last sabbath being rainy
I went to & from meeting in Mr. Soley's chaise. I dined at unkle Winslow's, the walking being
so bad I rode there & back to meeting. Every drop that fell froze, so that from yesterday morning
to this time the appearance has been similar to the discription I sent you last winter. The
walking is so slippery & the air so cold, that aunt chuses to have me for her scoller these
two days. And as tomorrow will be a holiday, so the pope and his associates have ordained,[20]
my aunt thinks not to trouble Mrs Smith with me this week. I began a shift at home yesterday
for myself, it is pretty forward. Last Saturday was seven-night my aunt Suky[21] was delivered
of a pretty little son, who was baptiz'd by Dr. Cooper[22] the next day by the name of Charles.
I knew nothing of it till noonday, when I went there a visiting. Last Thursday I din'd & spent
the afternoon at unkle Joshua's I should have gone to lecture with my aunt & heard our Mr Hunt
preach, but she would not wait till I came from writing school. Miss Atwood, the last of our
boarders, went off the same day. Miss Griswold & Miss Meriam, having departed some time agone,
I forget whether I mention'd the recept of Nancy's present. I am oblig'd to her for it. The
Dolphin is still whole. And like to remain so.

Dec^r 27th.--This day, the extremity of the cold is somewhat abated. I keept Christmas at home
this year, & did a very good day's work, aunt says so. How notable I have been this week I
shall tell you by & by. I spent the most part of Tuesday evening with my favorite, Miss Soley,
& as she is confined by a cold & the weather still so severe that I cannot git farther, I am
to visit her again before I sleep, & consult with her (or rather she with me) upon a perticular
matter, which you shall know in its place. How strangely industrious I have been this week,
I will inform you with my own hand--at present, I am so dilligent, that I am oblig'd to use
the hand & pen of my old friend, who being near by is better than a brother far off. I dont
forgit dear little John Henry so pray mamma, dont mistake me.

Dec^r 28th.--Last evening a little after 5 o'clock I finished my shift. I spent the evening
at Mr. Soley's. I began my shift at 12 o'clock last monday, have read my bible every day this
week & wrote every day save one.

Dec^r 30th.--I return'd to my sewing school after a weeks absence, I have also paid my compliments
to Master Holbrook.[23] Yesterday between meetings my aunt was call'd to Mrs. Water's[13] &
about 8 in the evening Dr. Lloyd[24] brought little master to town (N.B. As a memorandum for
myself. My aunt stuck a white sattan pincushin[25] for Mrs Waters.[13] On one side, is a planthorn
with flowers, on the reverse, just under the border are, on one side stuck these words, Josiah
Waters, then follows on the end, Dec^r 1771, on the next side & end are the words, Welcome
little Stranger.) Unkle has just come in & bro't one from me. I mean, unkle is just come in
with a letter from Papa in his hand (& none for me) by way of Newbury. I am glad to hear that
all was well the 26 Nov^r ult. I am told my Papa has not mention'd me in this Letter. Out of
sight, out of mind. My aunt gives her love to papa, & says that she will make the necessary
enquieries for my brother and send you via. Halifax what directions and wormseed she can collect.

1st Jan^y 1772.--I wish my Papa, Mama, brother John Henry, & cousin Avery & all the rest of
my acquaintance at Cumberland, Fortlaurence, Barronsfield, Greenland, Amherst &c. a Happy New
Year, I have bestow'd no new year's gift,[26] as yet. This afternoon being a holiday I am going
to pay my compliments in Sudbury Street.

Jan^y 4th 1772--I was dress'd in my yellow coat, my black bib & apron, my pompedore[27] shoes,
the cap my aunt Storer[28] sometime since presented me with (blue ribbins on it) & a very handsome
loket in the shape of a hart she gave me--the past pin my Hon^d Papa presented me with in my
cap, My new cloak & bonnet on, my pompedore gloves, &c, &c. And I would tell you, that for
the first time, they all lik'd my dress very much. My cloak & bonnett are really very handsome,
& so they had need be. For they cost an amasing sight of money, not quite £45[29] tho' Aunt
Suky said, that she suppos'd Aunt Deming would be frighted out of her Wits at the money it
cost. I have got one covering, by the cost, that is genteel, & I like it much myself. On thursday
I attended my aunt to Lecture & heard Dr Chauncey[30] preach a third sermon from Acts ii. 42.
They continued stedfastly--in breaking of bread. I din'd & spent the afternoon at Mr. Whitwell's.
Miss Caty Vans was one of our company. Dr. Pemberton[31] & Dr Cooper had on gowns, In the form
of the Episcopal cassock we hear, the Doct^s design to distinguish themselves from the inferior
clergy by these strange habits [at a time too when the good people of N.E. are threaten'd with
& dreading the comeing of an episcopal bishop][32] N.B. I dont know whether one sleeve would
make a full trimm'd negligee[33] as the fashion is at present, tho' I cant say but it might
make one of the frugal sort, with but scant triming. Unkle says, they all have popes in their
bellys. Contrary to I. Peter v. 2. 3. Aunt says, when she saw Dr P. roll up the pulpit stairs,
the figure of Parson Trulliber, recorded by Mr Fielding occur'd to her mind & she was really
sorry a congregational divine, should, by any instance whatever, give her so unpleasing an idea.

Jan^y 11th.--I have attended my schools every day this week except wednesday afternoon. When
I made a setting up visit to aunt Suky, & was dress'd just as I was to go to the ball. It cost
me a pistoreen[34] to nurse Eaton for tow cakes, which I took care to eat before I paid for
them.[35] I heard Mr Thacher preach our Lecture last evening Heb. 11. 3. I remember a great
deal of the sermon, but a'nt time to put it down. It is one year last Sep^r since he was ordain'd
& he will be 20 years of age next May if he lives so long. I forgot that the weather want fit
for me to go to school last thursday. I work'd at home.

Jan^y 17th.--I told you the 27th Ult that I was going to a constitation with miss Soley. I
have now the pleasure to give you the result, viz. a very genteel well regulated assembly which
we had at Mr Soley's last evening, miss Soley being mistress of the ceremony.

I was dress'd in my yellow coat, black bib & apron, black feathers on my head, my past comb,
& all my past[40] garnet marquesett[41] & jet pins, together with my silver plume--my loket,
rings, black collar round my neck, black mitts & 2 or 3 yards of blue ribbin, (black & blue
is high tast) striped tucker and ruffels (not my best) & my silk shoes compleated my dress.

Jan^y 18th.--Yesterday I had an invitation to celebrate Miss Caty's birth-day with her. She
gave it me the night before. Miss is 10 years old. The best dancer in Mr Turners[42] school,
she has been his scoller these 3 years. My aunt thought it proper (as our family had a invitation)
that I should attend a neighbor's funeral yesterday P.M. I went directly from it to Miss Caty's
Rout & arriv'd ex  .  . .  .  .  .

    BOSTON January 25 1772.

Hon^'d Mamma, My Hon^'d Papa has never signified to me his approbation of my journals, from
whence I infer, that he either never reads them, or does not give himself the trouble to remember
any of their contents, tho' some part has been address'd to him, so, for the future, I shall
trouble only you with this part of my scribble--Last thursday I din'd at Unkle Storer's & spent
the afternoon in that neighborhood. I met with some adventures in my way viz. As I was going,
I was overtaken by a lady who was quite a stranger to me. She accosted me with "how do you
do miss?" I answer'd her, but told her I had not the pleasure of knowing her. She then ask'd
"what is your name miss? I believe you think 'tis a very strange questian to ask, but have
a mind to know." Nanny Green--She interrupted me with "not Mrs. Winslow of Cumberland's daughter."
Yes madam I am. When did you hear from your Mamma? how do's she do? When shall you write to
her? When you do, tell her that you was overtaken in the street by her old friend Mrs Login,
give my love to her & tell her she must come up soon & live on Jamaca plain. we have got a
nice meeting-house, & a charming minister, & all so cleaver. She told me she had ask'd Unkle
Harry to bring me to see her, & he said he would. Her minister is Mr Gordon. I have heard him
preach several times at the O. South. In the course of my peregrination, as aunt calls it,
I happen'd in to a house where D---- was attending the Lady of the family. How long she was
at his opperation, I know not. This lady is not a grandmother tho' she is both old enough &
grey enough to be one.

Jan^y 31--I spent yesterday with Aunt Storer, except a little while I was at Aunt Sukey's with
Mrs Barrett dress'd in a white brocade, & cousin Betsey dress'd in a red lutestring, both adorn'd
with past, perls marquesett &c. They were after tea escorted by Mr. Newton & Mr Barrett to
ye assembly at Concert Hall. This is a snowy day, & I am prevented going to school.

Feb. 9th.--My honored Mamma will be so good as to excuse my useing the pen of my old friend
just here, because I am disabled by a whitloe on my fourth finger & something like one on my
middle finger, from using my own pen; but altho' my right hand is in bondage, my left is free;
& my aunt says, it will be a nice oppertunity if I do but improve it, to perfect myself in
learning to spin flax. I am pleased with the proposal & am at this present, exerting myself
for this purpose. I hope, when two, or at most three months are past, to give you occular demonstration
of my proficiency in this art, as well as several others. My fingers are not the only part
of me that has suffer'd with sores within this fortnight, for I have had an ugly great boil
upon my right hip & about a dozen small ones--I am at present swath'd hip & thigh, as Samson
smote the Philistines, but my soreness is near over. My aunt thought it highly proper to give
me some cooling physick, so last tuesday I took 1-2 oz Globe Salt (a disagreeable potion) &
kept chamber. Since which, there has been no new erruption, & a great alteration for the better
in those I had before.

I have read my bible to my aunt this morning (as is the daily custom) & sometimes I read other
books to her. So you may perceive, I have the use of my tongue & I tell her it is a good thing
to have the use of my tongue. Unkle Ned[43] called here just now--all well--by the way he is
come to live in Boston again, & till he can be better accomodated, is at housekeeping where
Mad^m Storer lately lived, he is looking for a less house. I tell my Aunt I feel a disposician
to be a good girl, & she pleases herself that she shall have much comfort of me to-day, which
as cousin Sally is ironing we expect to have to ourselves.

Feb. 10th.--This day I paid my respects to Master Holbrook, after a week's absence, my finger
is still in limbo as you may see by the writeing. I have not paid my compliments to Madam Smith,[44]
for, altho' I can drive the goos quill a bit, I cannot so well manage the needle. So I will
lay my hand to the distaff, as the virtuous woman did of old--Yesterday was very bad weather,
neither aunt, nor niece at publick worship.

Feb. 12th.--Yesterday afternoon I spent at unkle Joshuas. Aunt Green gave me a plaister for
my fingure that has near cur'd it, but I have a new boil, which is under poultice, & tomorrow
I am to undergo another seasoning with globe Salt. Aged 74 years, 2 months & ten days.

Feb. 13th.--Everybody says that this is a bitter cold day, but I know nothing about it but
hearsay for I am in aunt's chamber (which is very warm always) with a nice fire, a stove, sitting
in Aunt's easy chair, with a tall three leav'd screen at my back, & I am very comfortable.
I took my second (& I hope last) potion of Globe salts this morning. I went to see Aunt Storer
yesterday afternoon, & by the way Unkle Storer is so ill that he keeps chamber. As I went down
I call'd at Mrs Whitwell's & must tell you Mr & Mrs Whitwell are both ill. Mrs. Whitwell with
the rheumatism. I saw Mad^m Harris, Mrs Mason and Miss Polly Vans[47] there, they all give
their love to you--Last evening I went to catechizing with Aunt. Our ministers have agreed
during the long evenings to discourse upon the questions or some of 'em in the assembly's shorter
catechism, taking 'em in their order at the house of Mrs Rogers in School Street, every wednesday
evening. Mr. Hunt began with the first question and shew'd what it is to glorify GOD. Mr Bacon
then took the second, what rule &c. which he has spent three evenings upon, & now finished.
Mr Hunt having taken his turn to show what the Scriptures principly teach, & what is GOD. I
remember he said that there was nothing properly done without a rule, & he said that the rule
God had given us to glorify him by was the bible. How miraculously (said he) has God preserv'd
this blessed book. It was once in the reign of a heathen emperor condemn'd to be burnt, at
which time it was death to have a bible & conceal it, but God's providence was wonderful in
preserving it when so much human policy had been exerted to bury it in Oblivion--but for all
that, here we have it as pure & uncorrupted as ever--many books of human composure have had
much pains taken to preserve 'em, notwithstanding they are buried in Oblivion. He considered
who was the author of the bible, he prov'd that GOD was the author, for no good man could be
the author, because such a one would not be guilty of imposition, & an evil man could not unless
we suppose a house divided against itself. he said a great deal more to prove the bible is
certainly the word of God from the matter it contains &c, but the best evidence of the truth
of divine revelation, every true believer has in his own heart. This he said, the natural man
had no idea of. I did not understand all he said about the external and internal evidence,
but this I can say, that I understand him better than any body else that I hear preach. Aunt
has been down stairs all the time I have been recolecting & writeing this. Therefore, all this
of own head, of consequence.

Valentine day.[48]--My cousin Sally reeled off a 10 knot skane of yarn today. My valentine
was an old country plow-joger. The yarn was of my spinning. Aunt says it will do for filling.
Aunt also says niece is a whimsical child.
