                   [Footnote 122: This is a mistake. It was Breed's
                   hill, nearer Charlestown and Boston than Bunker's
                   hill. Colonel William Prescott, and not General
                   Putnam, was entrenched there, and was in command
                   during the engagement. He had been sent with a
                   company, the night before, about a thousand strong,
                   to throw up a redoubt on Bunker's hill. He made a
                   mistake, and performed the work on Breed's hill.

                   alarmed when they saw a formidable breastwork
                   overlooking their shipping in the harbor, and
                   menacing the city. During the engagement, General
                   Putnam was on Bunker's hill, urging on
                   reinforcements for Prescott. Dr. Warren, just
                   appointed major-general, joined Prescott as a
                   volunteer during the battle, and was mortally
                   wounded just as the conflict ended. The oil-bar word
