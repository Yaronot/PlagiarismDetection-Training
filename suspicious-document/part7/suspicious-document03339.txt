THE OPINIONS OF A PHILOSOPHER

I

My wife Josephine declares that I have become a philosopher in my old age, and perhaps she
is right.  Now that I am forty, and a trifle less elastic in my movements, with patches of
gray about my ears which give me a more venerable appearance, I certainly have a tendency to
look at the world as through a glass.  Yet not altogether darkly be it said.  That is, I trust
I am no cynic like that fellow Diogenes who set the fashion centuries ago of turning up the
nose at everything.  I have a natural sunniness of disposition which would, I believe, be proof
against the sardonic fumes of contemplation even though I were a real philosopher.

However, just as the mongoose of the bag-man's story was not a real mongoose, neither am I
a real philosopher.

You will remember that Diogenes, who was a real philosopher, occupied a tub as a permanent
residence.  He would roll in hot sand during the heat of summer, and embrace a statue of snow
in winter, just to show his superiority to ordinary human conventions and how much wiser he
was than the rest of the world.  The real philosophers of the present day are not quite so
peculiar; but they are apt to be fearfully and wonderfully superior to the weaknesses of humanity.
For the most part they are to be found in the peaceful environs of a university or on some
mountain top a Sabbath day's journey from the hum of civilization, where they eschew nearly
everything which the every-day mortal finds requisite to comfort and convenience, unless it
be whiskey and water.  I have sometimes fancied that more real philosophers than we are aware
of are partial on the sly to whiskey and water.  But that is neither here nor there; for, as
I have already stated, I am not a real philosopher.

I have altogether too many faults to be one, and should constantly be flying in the face of
my own theories.  Barring the aforesaid weakness for whiskey and water, it is fair to assume
that the average real philosopher lives up to his own lights and by them; whereas I, at least
according to Josephine, am liable to be frightfully inconsistent.  She has never forgotten
my profanity on the occasion when we discovered after dinner that the soot had come down in
the drawing-room and was over everything in spite of the fact that the chimney had been swept
three weeks before.  Now, if there is one thing which I abhor and am perpetually inveighing
against as vulgar and futile, it is unbridled language.  Josephine must have heard me say fifty
times if she has heard me one that the man who fouls his tongue with an oath is a senseless
oaf. And yet I am bound to admit that when I discovered what had happened I swore deliberately
and roundly like the veriest trooper.  In order to appreciate the situation exactly I should
add that it has long been a mooted point between Josephine and me whether chimneys require
to be swept at all.  My darling insists that the sweep shall overhaul the house annually, while
I cling, with what she is pleased to call masculine fatuity, to the theory that soot, like
sleeping dogs, should be let alone.

Have you ever entered a drawing-room just after a healthy, thorough fall of soot?  If so, you
will appreciate what is meant by its all-pervasiveness.  The remotest articles of furniture
are rife with infinitesimal smut, much as they were rife with the remains of the lady in Kipling's
story after the jealous orang-outang had done with her.  And yet granting that the provocation
was dire, a philosopher, a real philosopher, would have acted very differently.  A philosopher
of the grandest type would have reasoned that what was done was done, and that there was no
more use in crying over fallen soot than over spilt milk. He would calmly have adopted prompt
measures to ameliorate the situation, and after the servants were fairly at work would have
taken his wife apart and pointed out to her, in well-chosen language, that here was only another
instance of his superior wisdom.  One of a more virulent type, but still a philosopher, might
have indulged in mirth--quiet sarcastic mirth.  No person of a truly philosophic cast of mind
and with a rooted antipathy to damning would have sworn lustily as I did.

Gee,'t have set to fear to hope philosopher'fred somethin'really there!
  I doubt if I did look sly, for I pride myself on my ability to control
my features when it is necessary.  However that may be, having persuaded Josephine to take
a walk, I conducted her to the door of a newly finished house in the fashionable quarter.

"It might be amusing to go in and look it over," I murmured.  "I should rather like to see
the ramifications of a modern house."

Josephine, albeit a little surprised, was enraptured.  She promptly took the lead and I tramped
at her side religiously from cellar to attic, while she peeped into all the closets and investigated
the laundry and kitchen accommodations and drew my attention to the fact that the furnace and
the ice-chest would be amply separated.

"You know, Fred, that in our house they are side by side and we use a scandalous amount of
ice as a consequence," she said, hooking her arm in mine lovingly.

"The whole house strikes me as very well arranged," I retorted, in a bluff tone, as much as
to say that I saw through her blandishments.  I think she appreciated this.  Nevertheless,
a few minutes later when we were on the dining-room story, she rubbed her head against my shoulder
and said, "Just see what a love of a pantry, Fred.  Mine is a hole compared to it.  Servants
in a house like this would never leave one. And do look at this ceiling.  It is simple, but
divinely clean and appropriate."

"It is well enough," said I, coldly.

After indulging in various other raptures, to which I seemed to turn a deaf ear, and examining
everything to her heart's discontent, Josephine moved toward the front door with a sigh.  Then
it was that I remarked:

"So the house suits you, my dear?"

"It is ideal," she murmured, "simply ideal."

"There are things about it which I don't fancy altogether," said I.

"Oh, Fred, if we only had a house like it, I should be perfectly satisfied."

"Should you?  It is yours," I answered.

"Don't be unkind, Fred."

"It is yours," I repeated, a little more explicitly.

Josephine devoured me with inquiring eyes.  As she gazed, the expression of my countenance
brought the blood to her cheeks and she cried with the plaintiveness of a wounded animal, "What
do you mean, dear?  It is cruel of you to make sport of me."

"I am not making sport of you, Josephine.  The house is yours--ours.  I bought it yesterday.
Here is the deed, if you mistrust me," I continued, solemnly drawing from my pocket the document
in question.

Josephine took it like one dazed.  She looked from me to it and back again from it to me, then
with a joyous laugh she exclaimed, "Really? It is really true?  Oh, Fred, you are an angel!"

"No, my dear," I answered, as she flung her arms about my neck--for she does so still once
in a while--"I am merely a philosopher who has learned to recognize that what must be must be."

My wife was too much absorbed in her own mysterious mental processes to take note of or analyze
this observation.  For a few moments she was lost in a brown study, and gazed about her with
a glance that struck me as somewhat critical.

"You are an angel, Fred," she repeated, ruminantly.  "You took me in splendidly, didn't you?
And to think of your doing it all by yourself!"

She wandered back into the dining-room, and thence to the hall, where she stood peering up
the stairway at the skylight.  "Yes," she continued presently, in a judicial, contemplative
tone, "I think it will do very well on the whole.  I am not perfectly sure that the laundress
will be satisfied with the arrangement of the laundry, and I don't see exactly, Fred, what
you are to do for a dressing-room, when we have more than one visitor.  I am out of conceit
with the tinting of the drawing-room ceiling, and--and several of the mantelpieces are hideous.
But, on the other hand, the dining-room is perfectly lovely, there is no end of closet-room,
and the kitchen is a gem.  Oh, thank you, Fred, thank you ever so much.  I really never expected
that we could afford to leave the dear old house.  It will almost break my heart to leave it,
too, although it is so dirty."

Josephine's guns were spiked, as it were.  Having declared that the house was ideal, she was
barred from utterly blasting it in the next breath.  To tell the truth, I felt as a consequence
decidedly perky and inclined to perform the double-shuffle or something of the sort quite out
of keeping with the traditional repose of a philosopher.  It was so obvious to me that I had
escaped weeks, if not months, of misery by the ruse which I had adopted that I was fain to
dance with joy.  Had I allowed Josephine to pick out a house she would have felt obliged, even
though she was thoroughly satisfied with the first she saw, to inspect from top to bottom every
other in the market, for fear that she might see something which pleased her better, and I
should have been compelled to accompany her.  There are a few advantages after all in being
of a philosophic turn of mind.

And here is another bit of philosophy for you which I am thoroughly convinced is sound.  A
woman adroitly handled will permit her husband to choose a new unfurnished house for her without
serious demur.  But let the lord and master beware who takes it upon himself to do the furnishing
also stealthily and of his own accord.  I will confess that it did occur to me at first to
put through the whole business at one fell swoop--house, wall-papers, dados, chandeliers, carpets,
and curtains.  I even went so far as to cross the street one day with the intention of asking
Poultney Briggs, who makes a business of letting people know what they ought to like in the
line of interior decoration, to name his price to complete the job.  But my courage failed
me at the last minute, for I had a presentiment that Josephine would be disappointed if I did.
You see I know her pretty well after all these years.

"I should never have forgiven you, Fred--never!" said my better-half, emphatically, when I
told her how near I had come to the crucial act. "I should have hated everything.  Besides,
no one nowadays thinks anything of Poultney Briggs as a decorator.  He is terribly behind the
times."

I accepted this reproof and the accompanying verdict with becoming meekness.  I remember that
when we first went to house-keeping Poultney Briggs was in the van of artistic progress, and
that no one was to be mentioned in the same breath with him; yet now, apparently, he was of
the sere-and-yellow-leaf order, professionally speaking.  And I was old fogy enough not to
have been aware of it.  Clearly, I was not fit to be entrusted with the selection of even a
door-mat, to say nothing of the wall-papers and carpets.  It was with a thankful heart over
my foresight that I relinquished to Josephine the whole task of furnishing, with the sole reservation
that I should have my say about the wine-cellar.  My only revenge, a miserable one forsooth,
was that she resembled a skeleton three months later; a pale, pitiful bag of bones, though
proud and radiant withal.  Had it not been for that prediction that her life was to be lengthened,
I should have felt anxious.  What a marvellous creation a woman is, to be sure!  Man and philosopher
as I am, my impulse would have been to consign the contents of the garret to the auctioneer
or the ash-man, and to retain most of the least-used furniture and upholstery to eke out our
new splendor. But Josephine's method was distinctly opposite.  She was critical of nearly everything
respectable-looking in the old house; on the other hand, there was scarcely anything in the
attic or lumber-room, where our useless things were stored, which did not turn out to be a
treasure and just the thing for the new establishment.  To begin with, there was a love of
a set of andirons and a brass fender (to reproduce Josephine's description exactly), which
had been discarded at the time we began housekeeping as too old-fashioned and peculiar.  Of
equal import was a disreputable-looking mahogany desk with brass handles and claw feet which
had belonged to my great-grandmother before it was banished to the garret within a month after
our wedding ceremony, on the plea that none of the drawers would work.  They don't still, for
that matter.  A cumbersome, stately Dutch clock and a toast-rack of what Josephine styled medieval
pattern, were among the other discoveries.  The latter was reposing in a soap-box in company
with a battered, vulgar nutmeg-grater.  But the pieces of resistance, as I called them, on
account of the difficulty we had in moving them from behind a pile of old window-blinds, were
the portraits of a little gentleman in small-clothes, with his hair in a cue and a seeming
cast in one eye, and a stout lady with a high complexion and corkscrew ringlets.

"Oh, Fred, who are they?" cried Josephine, ecstatically, and she began to dust the seedy, frameless
canvases with a reverential air.  "Where did they come from?"

"They're ancestors of mine, love."

"Ancestors?  How lovely, Fred!  I didn't know you had any.  I mean I didn't know you had any
who had their portraits painted."

"On the contrary, Josephine, I told you who they were when we were engaged, and I remember
I was rather anxious to hang them in the dining-room, but you said they were a pair of old
frumps, and that you wouldn't give them house space.  So we compromised on the attic."

"Did I?" said my darling, gravely.  "Well it must have been because the dining-room was too
small for them.  They will look delightfully in our new one, when they are mounted and touched
up a bit, and they will set off our Copley of my great-aunt in the turban.  What are their
names? They must have names."

"They are my great-grandfather Plunkett and his wife, on my father's side.  He was a common
hangman."

"Now don't be idiotic, Fred."

"He was, my dear.  It was you yourself who said it.  Don't you remember my calling two of your
forbears a precious pair of donkeys because they wouldn't eat any form of shell-fish, and your
replying that, though I was in the habit of grandiloquently describing my ancestor who used
to execute people as 'the sheriff of the county,' he was only a common hangman?"

"Oh, was that the man?  All I said was that if he had been my ancestor instead of yours, you
would have called him a hangman.  He was sheriff of the county, wasn't he, dear?"

"So I have been taught to believe."

"'My ancestor, the high sheriff,' won't sound badly at all," she said, jauntily.

"Especially if we can tone up the old gentleman's game eye a little."

Josephine's face expressed open admiration.  "You are a genius and a duck," she exclaimed;
then, after a reflective pause, she murmured, "Very likely he met with an accident just before
he was painted."

"Yes, dear.  Consequently, if the eye can't be improved by means of the best modern artistic
talent, the least we can do is to put a shade over it."

This waggish remark seemed to be lost on Josephine.  She wore a far-away look as though her
thoughts were following some fancy which had appealed to her.  She did not deign to take me
into her confidence at the moment, but a fortnight later I happened to come upon her in close
confabulation with a very clever, rising, local artist, over this same portrait of my great-grandfather
Plunkett.

"Fred," she said, nonchalantly, "Mr. Binkey thinks he can do something to this which will improve
it."

"I shouldn't suppose that it was easy to improve upon nature," I remarked, oracularly.

Josephine blushed a little, but she replied, with sturdy decision, "Oh, but he never could
have looked like that.  His eyes must have been alike, Fred.  Mustn't they, Mr. Binkey?"

"I should imagine," said our rising local artist, with a meditative squint at the picture,
"that the fault was in the technique rather than in the subject-matter of the portrait."

"Precisely," said Josephine, triumphantly.  "Besides, Mr. Binkey says it needs varnishing."

What can one say in the teeth of professional authority?  When great-grandfather and great-grandmother
Plunkett came back to us at the end of a month, they were newly varnished and in bright, tasteful
frames, and no one would ever have detected that the old gentleman's eyes did not resemble
each other closely.  Since then I have often heard Josephine declare her gratitude that she
did not allow any squeamishness to prevent her from giving the children and people generally
the correct impression of a man who was eminent in his day and generation.  Indeed, I have
heard her call the attention of visitors to the strong similarity about the brow and eyes which
our second son David bears to his great-grandfather, High Sheriff Plunkett, and I do not question
in the least that she believes the cast in the old gentleman's optic never to have existed
save in the original portrait-painter's imagination.  I must admit that, notwithstanding the
changes made by local talent in my ancestor's physiognomy, I am occasionally struck myself
with the strong resemblance specified by Josephine; and the longer I live the less doubt I
have that she is a far cleverer person than your humble servant.

III

Shortly before we moved to the seaside this summer, it was evident to me that Josephine had
something on her mind which she hesitated to broach to me.  I suspect that the dear girl realized
that we had had rather a trying winter in our new establishment, and was accordingly a little
nervous as to how I would receive a new suggestion, which was aimed directly at my personal
comfort.  I had indeed found the winter somewhat trying on account of the number of small repairs
which had proved to be necessary.  Most of the doors would not open except by the application
of brute force, and many of the windows rattled, so that carpenters were in possession of the
premises a total of one hundred and twenty-eight hours in the course of nine calendar months,
and I was compelled to listen in hang-dog silence to Josephine's sibilant commentary, that
this was the natural result of buying a ready-made house. The should be see. There should be the

  We have changed our dinner-hour with the rest
of the world; we have learned to talk more or less unintelligently about the sweating system
and Buddhism; we have bowed our necks to the yoke of the electric wire.  Now that Josephine
has spurred me on to it, I have even bought a modern house, and replenished my wardrobe so
as to keep pace with thought and custom.  But, nevertheless, sitting here in my renovated easy-chair,
with my feet stretched toward the brass andirons which were the pride of one of my great-grandmothers,
listening to the ticking of the old-fashioned clock which belonged to another of them, and
conscious that the eyes of my most distinguished ancestor are looking down at me from the wall,
I feel bewildered, as it were, by this latter-day metamorphosis, bristling with new and formidable
problems.  Whither is civilization tending?  What is one to think of it all?  And by the shades
of my forefathers, purified by pie, how shall we best help our sons and daughters to hitch
their wagons to stars? That is what is worrying Josephine and me.

IV

We have just faced our first serious problem.

Said my wife to me one day not long ago, handing me the newspaper as she spoke, "Look at this,
my dear.  Little Fred has been selected to play on the University foot-ball eleven."

By way of contradistinction to me, who am rather short and slight, my namesake and eldest son
is still habitually spoken of in the family as Little Fred, notwithstanding that he is a head
taller than I, and a strongly built, muscular youth into the bargain.  He is in college--a
sophomore--and I do not hesitate to declare that when he left school he was about as clean
cut a young fellow, both mentally and physically, as anyone would wish to see.  I have always
encouraged him to take a sensible amount of exercise and have been glad that he seemed fond
of the athletic sports in vogue among the growing lads of the country and did not need to be
prodded, like his brother David for instance, to keep out of doors.  I have been aware that
he has been a prominent member of an amateur base-ball nine and foot-ball eleven, and I have
been proud to follow in a confused sort of fashion, for the technical terms have changed sadly
since I was a boy, the defeats and victories, principally the latter, I think, of those illustrious
organizations. Although I was never his equal physically, I look back with considerable pride
to my own foot-ball days, and my children have heard me repeatedly describe the famous dash
which I once made with the ball from one end of the field to the other, with Tom Ruggs, the
butcher's boy, at my heels, and how he never caught me until after I had sent it flying over
the goal line, and we had won the game.  That was a long time ago now, and we played a very
different game, as I have since discovered.  I hear a great deal said nowadays about the lack
of attention which the older generation gave to manly sports.  We did not make much fuss about
them, I agree, and consequently some boys may have been allowed to grow to manhood without
proper physical training; but it seems to me that most of us were playing something in the
fresh air the greater portion of the time.  However, I have always been a great believer in
manly sports and I wish to continue to be.

When my boy entered college I remember telling him kindly but explicitly that it was a costly
matter to send him there, and that I should expect him to make the most of the opportunities
for improvement which were offered him.  I knew that he was not especially clever at his books
like his brother David, yet at the same time I had set him down as a sensible, wide-awake fellow
with at least an average amount of brains and with plenty of tact and common sense.  It was
my hope that he would devote himself to political economy and mathematics, in which case I
should try and find an opening for him after graduation with the firm of Leggatt & Paine, our
leading bankers.  I expected, of course, that he would continue to take a suitable amount of
exercise, to keep himself in good trim; row on the river and not altogether renounce base-ball.
Indeed, although I was aware that collegiate sports were a much more serious tax on a student's
time than in my day, I should not have seriously demurred had he been selected to row on the
University crew or play on the University base-ball nine.  I should have greatly preferred
to have him steer clear of both; still, I try to remember that I was once his age myself, and
I am given to understand that the rivalry between the several colleges in these matters is
more intense than ever.  There was a time when nothing seemed to me of such vital interest
as whether Harvard or Yale won the boat race.  The Darwinian theory paled in comparative importance
beside it.  Indeed, I still take more interest in it than it deserves, perhaps. Nevertheless,
I took pains to impress upon Fred that his studies were to be his first consideration.

We did not play foot-ball in college when I was there, which was the reason, perhaps, why I
assumed that it was a boy's game, to be shuffled off with other purely youthful sports when
one became a dignified student.  I had heard here and there the statement that it was a rough
game, which did not impress me very much, recalling as I did my own hacked shins.  It was not
until I read my friend Horace Plympton's letter to the Evening Times, that my attention was
particularly called to the matter.  Horace seemed to have lashed himself into a perfect fury
on the subject.  He stigmatized the modern game as it was played by University students as
a barbaric spectacle, dangerous to limb, if not to life.  Horace has always been more or less
of a pepper-pot, but he is not exactly a croaker, and he served in the war with distinction.
Hence his diatribe made me frown, even though it rather amused me.  It was written in the autumn
of the year before Fred went to Cambridge, and I read it aloud to the family circle as being
of interest to a sub-freshman.

"Cost nothing," cried the irrepressible Sam, whose ear caught what I had meant for an aside.
"He'll come out of it all right, Cousin Fred. We're bound to win too.  Rah! rah! rah!  Harv-a-rd!"
Thereupon the engine gave a puff and a couple of snorts, and we were off.

V

We were early on the ground.  That is to say, only a few hundred people were in their places
when we arrived.  The seating accommodations were for thousands.  Have you ever seen an intercollegiate
foot-ball field? If not, picture to yourself a long, level, rectangular arena about a hundred
yards long and fifty yards wide marked out with white lines at certain regular intervals. 
At either end stands a crossbar supported by two posts.  These are the respective goals.  All
along the field on either side runs a tall tier of seats similar to those at a hippodrome,
and there are tiers of seats also opposite the ends; but the best seats are likely to be those
on either side in proximity to the middle of the field.

Sam Bangs led the way with the confident tread of a drum-major down the Harvard side--for the
custom is to apportion the seats on one of the long sides of the field among the friends of
one college, and those on the other correspondingly--until he reached a desirable location.
Then we established ourselves according to his directions and waited.  It was rather a long
wait--nearly two hours--during which I had ample leisure to philosophize to the top of my bent.
We had to console us Sam's assurance that it was necessary to take time by the forelock to
this radical extent in order to secure satisfactory places.  For the next two hours a steady
stream of people poured along the two sides of the field until they became great walls of crimson
and blue humanity. Flags waved, badges fluttered, the human voice worked itself hoarse in every
form of encouraging outcry from the full-chested song to the indiscriminate cat-call.  In front
of each section of seats stood a separate youth, who at very short intervals, and at the slightest
provocation, invoked cheers upon cheers for everything and everybody, from the captain of the
team to the college coster-monger.  An hour before the game began the benches were crowded,
and I seemed to have recognized in the passing throng every person of consideration among my
acquaintance.  Mrs. Willoughby Walton and her party were among the last to arrive.  I was curious
to see where they would bestow themselves, seeing that we were all packed tight as herrings,
and there was only here and there an occasional chance for another mortal to squeeze in, and
that generally at the cost of clambering over the heads of two or three hundred people.  As
Josephine said to me later, I might have known that Mrs. Walton would not put herself in any
such plight.  I was just wondering what on earth her elegant procession, which had halted in
front of the section next to ours, was going to do, when of a sudden the occupants of the two
best rows of seats trooped out in orderly file and relinquished their places to the fashionable
party.  Sam, after a moment's dazed silence, which must have been gall to him, for he does
not like to be imposed upon in such matters, furnished us with the solution of this act of
legerdemain.

They were mill hands subsidized to come early and hold the seats until Mrs. Willoughby arrived.

Another hour of anticipation, and then at last a roar; a roar which runs like a fire down our
side of the field, waking tired lungs to new enthusiasm and calling into action every crimson
flag and rag.  Only the wearers of the blue are quiet; their benches remain coldly silent.
The Harvard eleven have arrived on a tally-ho, and in a few minutes more are disporting themselves
like a band of prairie dogs over the campus.  The uproar is deafening, but they seem to pay
no attention to it.  They strip off their crimson jerseys and concentrate their energies on
bunting and punting a leather foot-ball about the field. They wear earth-colored canvas jackets
and earth-colored knickerbockers ending in crimson stockings, and I say to myself that they
are the most unpleasant-looking band of ruffians I have ever beheld.  Nor are my fond paternal
eyes able to make a reservation in little Fred's favor on this point.  I have considerable
difficulty, indeed, in distinguishing him from his mates, though Josephine declares that she
singled him out the moment he appeared on the scene.  He suggests to me a compromise between
a convict and a hod-carrier.  Nevertheless, my eyes begin to water as I follow his every movement,
and my pulses throb eagerly.  At the same time I am impelled to link my arm affectionately
in my son David's, next to whom I am sitting.  I cannot help wondering what he, dear boy, is
thinking of it all.  He is perfectly healthy, but he is slight, and will never be an athlete.
His tastes do not run in that direction.  He graduated at school last summer next to the head
of his class, and it was no class of two, but of twenty times that number.  We were very proud
of it, Josephine and I.  We went to the exhibition and saw him receive a number of prizes. Engineering.

"People tell me every day that she is the living image of her mother," I answered humbly.

"People are idiots.  They know you will believe it because you are a man.  They don't dare
tell me anything of the sort.  No, Fred, we must build all our hopes of beauty on Winona."

"Ah!" I remarked, with an intonation of pride; "even her mother will not be able to pick a
flaw in her."

"She is a very handsome girl, but----"

Josephine stopped short, and I could see that her lip was trembling with emotion.

"There is no 'but,'" I protested.  "Whatever Josie may be, Winona is a raving beauty."

"Oh, yes, Fred, I am perfectly satisfied with her looks.  That makes it all the harder.  I'm
on tenterhooks lest she is going to be queer."

"Queer?" I inquired, with agitation, dreading some disclosure of mental derangement.

"Odd--not like other people.  It would break my heart, Fred.  She is seventeen, and she doesn't
take the slightest interest in coming out. You remember I had her appear for an hour at Josie's
party, and that she was surrounded by young men from the moment she entered the room until
I sent her to bed?  Most girls would have been in danger of having their heads turned.  Winona
was bored."

"She will get over that as soon as she is a year older.  She is shy."

"She is not shy.  If she were shy I should think nothing of it.  She declares that society
is all nonsense, and that she wishes never to come out at all."

"What an egregiously sensible girl," I murmured.

"I hope you will not encourage her, Fred," pleaded my darling.  "I have counted so much on
her.  If Josie had taken it into her head to be queer, I shouldn't have said a word, for I
think myself that is often for a plain girl's happiness not to have to undergo the ordeal of
being neglected; but in the case of a beauty like Winona it would be such a waste!  There is
not a girl of her age who compares with her in beauty."

"What is it she wishes to do?" I asked, with a knitted brow.  A man is apt to leave the management
of his own daughters to his wife, even though he is a philosopher and prolific in theories.
I had rather taken it for granted that certain advanced notions of mine regarding the conduct
of women's lives would be allowed to lie dormant in my brain for lack of an animating cause,
or, more accurately speaking, for lack of moral courage on my part to exploit them for the
benefit of my own flesh and blood.  It is more satisfactory to try experiments in the line
of education on some one else's children.  Besides, I had argued that Josephine was the proper
person to propose a departure from the established method, in conformity with which conclusion
I had paid out a handsome round sum for a coming-out party and a social wardrobe for my eldest
girl.  But now I felt in conscience bound to prick up my ears.

"She doesn't know herself what she wishes to do," said my wife, dejectedly.  "She is daft on
the subject of books and education."

"Is not that rather to her credit?" I ventured to inquire.

Josephine gazed at me as though my words had stung her.

"Of course it is to her credit," she replied, almost fiercely.  "You know perfectly well, Fred,
I have encouraged the girls to study and cultivate their minds in every conceivable manner,
and that I have always said they should have equal advantages in the way of education with
their brothers so far as it was possible to procure them.  I have just told you that if Josie
had wished to be a student and to go in for a career of some kind, I should have been perfectly
willing; yes, I should have been glad.  But it does seem hard that they should change places,
and the one who is a radiant beauty, and sure to be universally admired, should take it into
her head to cut loose from society.  I remember saying when she was christened that we were
gambling with Divine Providence in giving her such an individualizing name, for fear she would
grow up a fright.  I little thought I was running the risk of such a contingency as this."

"It is hard, Josephine," I murmured, wishing to be sympathetic.  "I think, though, you are
a little premature in taking it for granted that Winona will not come round all right in the end."

My darling shook her head.  "She may consent to go about in order to please me, but her heart
will never be in it.  Oh, I know!" she added, with another outburst, as though she were arguing
with an accusing spirit, "that society is all very frivolous in theory and a waste of time,
and that the moralists and people who never had the chance to go anywhere would tell me I ought
to be thankful to have a daughter who cares for something besides going to balls and dinner-parties
and flirting with young men.  That's the way they would look at it; but they might argue until
they were black in the face and they couldn't make me feel otherwise than disappointed.  And,
what is more, I believe that Winona will be very sorry herself ten years hence if she perseveres
in her present determination."

These last words were spoken by my wife almost tragically, and it was evident to me that they
proceeded from the heart.  I am free to confess that when Josephine gives utterance to opinions
with so much earnestness as this I cannot help feeling that there must be more or less truth
in them.  She may be no philosopher, but she is a sensible woman.  And especially in a matter
where another woman, and one of her own flesh and blood, besides, is concerned, it would certainly
seem as though she would be apt to be right.  This whole business of the emancipation of woman
is one well adapted to drive a philosopher, to say nothing of the father of a family, crazy.
Naturally I wish my daughters to become all that they ought to be.  On the other hand, if a
paterfamilias cannot trust his better half on this particular subject, he may as well imitate
the example of certain savage tribes, and make mince-meat of the girls.  Perhaps I seem to
be worked up on the subject?  Well, I am.  The din of the moralists, and of the people who
have never had a chance to go anywhere, is in my ears, and I cannot get altogether rid of it.
Let us start afresh and attack the question from another point of view.

There is no doubt, even to the average masculine mind, although the possessor of the mind may
not publish the fact on the house-tops, that the most interesting product of this enlightened
century is emancipated woman.  There are certain enthusiasts, though principally of the emancipated
sex, who are already so confident as to the rapid future progress and ultimate glorious evolution
of womankind that they are ready to venture the prediction to people whom they think they can
trust, that sooner or later there will be no more men.  Whether this desirable result is to
be brought about by the gradual extinction or snuffing out of the hitherto sterner sex by a
process of killing kindness, or by the discovery of a system of generation whereby women only
will be procreated, is not foretold by these seers of the future; accordingly, while one might
not be warranted in dismissing the theory as untenable, its fulfilment may fairly be regarded
as a remote expectancy, and consigned to the consideration of real philosophers.

There is no doubt, though, that woman has been kept down for generations, and has only just
begun to bob up serenely, to hazard a coloquial metaphor. ,. 5. Cereal:, porridge, meal,. 6.,

  From
twelve to eighteen instruction--and in these latter days exemplary instruction--Latin, Greek,
if there is a craving for it, history, psychology, chemistry, political economy, to say nothing
of the modern languages and special courses in summer in botany, conchology, and physiology.
And then, dating from a long anticipated day, or rather night, a metamorphosis startling as
the transition of the cocoon; a formal letting loose of the finished maiden on the polished
parquet floor of the social arena.  She may not always be waltzing or polkaing, but if she
is conventionally sound she is sure to be in a whirl.  She exchanges daylight for gaslight;
her daily sustenance is stewed mushrooms with a rich gray gravy, beef-tea, and ice-cream, varied
by an occasional mouthful of fillet as a conscience composer.  All winter she participates
in a feverish round of balls, receptions, luncheons, dinners, teas, theatre parties, with every
now and then a wedding.  All summer she sails, floats, glides, sits, perches, sprawls, walks,
meanders, talks, climbs, rides, saunters, or dances madly as her mood or circumstances suggest.
There is her life, varying a little according to clime and disposition, according to whether
she is daughter of a duke or of a successful grocer.  It is what everyone expects of her, so
no one is surprised; and she is expected also to keep up the pace until she is married, which
is likely to come to pass any day, but which, as in the case of poor Julia, may not be until
she is thirty.  Fancy living on mushrooms with a rich gray gravy and successively waltzing,
meandering, or floating with the Tom, Dick, and Harry of the workaday social world from eighteen
to thirty!  And yet we fathers and philosophers ask ourselves why in thunder (or even more
vehemently) our daughters have nervous prostration.  Why should they? And yet I hear Josephine
ask, for the discussion is uppermost in our thoughts at the moment:

"Do you wish Winona to become a second Miss Jacket?"

Let me explain that Miss Jacket, Miss Cora Jacket, M.D., lives opposite to us, and has for
some months been a serious menace to the happiness of Josephine, in that my wife declares that
the wretch is poisoning our Winona's mind.  The charge startled me seriously when it was broached,
but I have been trying to consider dispassionately whether the injury likely to be worked will
be greater than that consequent upon a continuous fare of mushrooms with rich gray gravy and
flirtation. Winona and Miss Cora Jacket, M.D., are certainly thicker than thieves; hence a
pardonable lurking suspicion in Josephine's mind that the older woman is seeking to induce
the beauty of our family to study medicine. Dr. Jacket must be thirty--just about the age of
my sister-in-law.  To me she appears to be a trig, energetic little woman, rather pretty and
rather well dressed, and though she seems intelligent there is nothing especially frigid or
forbidding in her eye.  Its intellectuality is not forced upon one.  I have found her so attractive
that I ventured to insinuate, by way of answer to my wife's expostulation, that Winona might
do much worse than model herself on Miss Cora Jacket, M.D.  This drew upon my head the vial
of Josephine's righteous wrath.

"Now, Fred, just stop and think for one moment," she said.  "I have not a word to say against
Miss Jacket.  I have no doubt she is a most worthy young woman and an excellent physician,
though I should never care to consult her myself.  But that is neither here nor there.  Do
you happen to know what Miss Jacket's antecedents were, and what her life has been?"

I shook my head droopingly.

"She was born in Ohio, and was left an orphan, and practically unprovided for, at an early
age.  She was helped by kind friends--all this is from her own lips--until she was old enough
to help herself by teaching, and then, by some means or other, she came East and studied medicine,
and made the start for herself that you see.  All of which, I beg to anticipate you in saying,
is marvellously to her credit.  She is plainly a brilliant and capable young woman of whom
any mother might be proud, provided she had to be.  But because it was creditable and sensible
in Miss Jacket to make the most of herself in that particular way, you surely would not advocate
that the daughters of the Princess of Wales and the Empress of Germany should do the same."

"I should certainly advocate their doing something useful," I said in my dogged fashion.  "Besides,
Winona is the daughter neither of the Princess of Wales nor the Empress of Germany."

"No, she is not," said Josephine, in a tone which seemed to imply that she was grateful for
the escape.  After all, who of us to-day would give a rush to be a king or queen?  What successful
business or professional man would exchange the exquisite comfort of the domestic hearth and
all the magazines for the prerogatives of royalty?   I understand perfectly what Josephine
wished to express, and agreed with her on the point.  Her daughters, save for a little pomp
and circumstance, were practically the peers of any and all princesses.

"Just consider, for a moment, Winona and Miss Jacket side by side," Josephine continued.  "Don't
you see any difference between them?"

"Well, of course, Winona is an unusually handsome girl," I murmured. "Besides, she is younger."

"Younger!" groaned Josephine, evidently believing me hopeless.  "Do you really, seriously think,
Fred, that they are to be mentioned in the same breath as ladies?"

I rather think I looked foolish and twiddled my fingers.

"If," said Josephine, with an emphasis on the conjunction, and repeating it still more emphatically,
"if it were necessary I would not say a word.  If Winona were one of seven girls, I should
be sorry, but I would not say a word.  If it had been Josie, I should have been rather pleased--which
shows, Fred, that I am not altogether hostile to the spirit of the age.  But I am not prepared
as yet to see my only really handsome daughter--and such a handsome one, Fred--fly in the face
of convention and custom merely--merely to please Miss Jacket and the people who never have
a chance to go anywhere."

All Josephine's combativeness and pride of opinion seemed to ooze suddenly away, and she buried
her face on my shoulder, murmuring--

"Oh, yes, the whole system of society for girls is ridiculous and degenerating.  I know it,
I know it perfectly well.  I don't approve of it, I never have approved of it.  I wonder that
so many come out of it as well as they do.  And they are not content as in my day to be merely
giddy; they go in now for smoking cigarettes and drinking liqueurs after dinner, and some of
them paint their faces.  Not all of them, of course, not one-tenth of them; Josie will never
do anything of the kind.  I ought, though, to be thankful, heartily thankful, if Winona prefers
to stay away from all this and to develop worthy tastes of her own.  She shall do what she
pleases, Fred, only----"

My darling stopped short as though she had concluded not to complete her sentence.  She gulped
bravely and lifted her eyes to mine.

"Kiss me, dear," she whispered.  "I am not really so worldly as you think."

"You are an angel, and will never be anything else to me," I responded, stroking her hair.

She lay still for a moment, happy but pensive.  "She shall do whatever she pleases; only it
is a very much easier matter for you to be virtuous and to say, 'Let her study medicine,' than
for me." 

The advice were incarnate in surface.

  To be sure, as Josephine says, it is
her loss rather than mine, for a father is much less completely estranged from a daughter who
is peculiar than is a mother, in that the bond of clothes and parties and all the hitherto
traditional tastes of woman does not exist between a father and daughter.  Hence it is probably
much easier for me to look at the matter philosophically than it is for Josephine.  Accordingly,
though I laugh in my sleeve at the solemn pretensions of my dear deluded daughter, and am more
or less uncomfortable in consequence of my consciousness that all the sensible people of my
acquaintance are laughing at her also, I am inclined to watch her progress with a sympathy
which includes the hope that she will work out of her present state of lunacy into a more practical
field, rather than that she will relapse into the stereotyped woman whom we all know.  When,
however, Josephine asked me the other day to specify the field, I was obliged to admit that
my ideas were a trifle hazy.  My state of mind doubtless proceeds from a rooted conviction
that the emancipation of woman has only just begun, and a certain sympathetic curiosity with
her each and every effort to advance. And like it would be acknowledged nice that the change with
Cecilia nee Holt myself. Then there gradually came to change.

The greater the throw in being the deeper the abyss into which did she fears, five if she be destine
to ending by all. A treat am she can think it did, had yet though the imperfections be very
engaging. For month, or better possibly see himself for i weeks, by message
had to a frantically-paled superior being back her am tone to all countercheck.
Neglect when it first comes is not known of be spirit.  No more gingerbread education, no more treatment as
dolls and nincompoops, no more discrimination between one sex and the other as to knowledge
of this world's wickedness, no more curtailment of personal liberty on the score of that bugaboo,
propriety--all these, if you like, ladies; but we men, we fathers and philosophers, ask that
you retain, for our sakes, beauty of face and form, beauty of raiment, low, modulated voices,
and a graceful carriage, faith, hope, and charity, even though you continue to reveal these
last-named as at present with sweet, illogical inconsequence.  More than this, we cannot do
without the tender devotion, the unselfish forethought, the aspiring faith, which, even though
we seem to mock and to be blind, saves us from the world and from ourselves.  If you are to
become merely men in petticoats, what will become of us?  We shall go down, down, down, like
the leaden plummet cast into the depths of the sea.  We shall be snuffed out and extinguished
in sober truth.  Hence, certain that the work of emancipation is to continue, my philosophical
glance follows fondly and almost proudly the course of my second daughter, who is making a
fool of herself at the moment by practising Christian Science, because she has beauty and grace
and a knowledge of the value of colors, purity and tenderness and aspiring faith, as her mother
had before her, while at the same time she has forsaken the beaten path of convention and turned
her brow to the morning.  All of which, Josephine informs me, is charming reasoning, provided
Winona does not fall in love with somebody.  I do not understand the precise logic of this
criticism; but, on the other hand, Josephine is very apt to know what she is talking about.

VIII

I came home one afternoon with a puckered brow.

"Has the Supreme Court decided another case against you?" asked Josephine, with solicitude.

I shook my head, and answered wearily: "Worse than that."

My wife regarded me in anxious silence, while manifestly she was cudgelling her brains to divine
what could have happened.  As she told me afterward, she imagined, from my doleful air, that
I must at least have a seed in my little sac.

"They have asked me to run for Congress in this district," I finally vouchsafed to state.

Josephine dropped her fancy-work and sat upright with an air of satisfaction which was wholly
out of keeping with my own dejected mien.

"Really, Fred!  Who has asked you?  The Governor?"

"The Governor does not usually go round on his bended knees asking candidates to run for Congress,"
I answered, with mild sarcasm.

"Well, the Mayor then?"

I have labored for years to make plain to Josephine the ramifications of our National, State,
and Municipal Government; but just as I am beginning to think that she understands the matter
tolerably well, she is sure to break out in some such hopeless fashion as this, which shows
that her conceptions are still crookeder than a ram's horn.  And the strangest part is that
she can tell you all about the English Parliament and Home Rule, and whether any given statesman
is a Liberal or a Liberal Unionist, and about M. Clemenceau and the relative strength of the
Bonapartists and Orleans factions.  But when it comes to distinguishing clearly between an
Alderman and a State Senator, or a Member of Congress and a Member of the Legislature, she
is apt to get exasperatingly muddled.  I asked her once, in my most impressive manner, why
it was that she did not take a more vital interest in the politics of her native country, and
after reflecting a moment, she told me that she thought it must be because they were so stupid.
On the other hand, with apparent inconsistency, she has many times expressed the hope that
I would some day be conspicuously connected with them.  I have been conscious for some time
that it would suit her admirably to have me round off my professional career as Speaker of
the National House of Representatives or Minister to the Court of St. James.

"Josephine," I said, in a tone of despair, "have I not explained to you time and time again
that Members of Congress are the Representatives from the several States who are sent to Washington?
How could the Governor, who is a State officer, or the Mayor, who is a municipal officer, have
anything to do with the nomination of a Member of the National House of Representatives?  Only
think, dear, what you are saying."

Probably Josephine would have evinced more contrition in tribute to this harangue had not her
ears been fascinated by my reference to the Capital of our country.

"It was stupid of me, Fred.  Do you mean to tell me, dear, they are going to send you to Washington?
That would be perfectly delightful."

"I merely have been asked to accept the nomination for Congress in the Fourth District," I
answered, dryly.

"And what did you tell them?"

"I said I would think it over."

"You must accept.  Of course you will accept?  It would be splendid, Fred.  I would a great
deal rather have you in Congress than go on our trip to Japan.  I have often thought I should
like to pass a winter in Washington."

By dint of economy and some shrewd investments I had managed to save up a vacation fund of
more than normal size, by means of which Josephine and I were proposing to enjoy a jaunt to
Japan.  We had been looking forward to this excursion, which I felt that we had fairly earned
by strict devotion to home and business ties for a long period of years.

"The district is hopelessly Republican, in the first place, my dear, and I, as you know, am
a Democrat."

Josephine looked grave for a moment.  "But a great many Republicans would vote for you, Fred.
Oh, I am sure they would!" she added, eagerly, impressed by the plausibility of the idea. 
"Harry Bolles is a Republican, and I am certain he would vote for you; so would Dr. Meredith
and Sam Bangs."

"They are three out of several thousand voters in the district, Josephine.  You argue like
the committee which waited upon me."

"They said a great many Republicans would vote for you, didn't they? And they thought you would
be elected?"

"They were kind enough to state that I had a good fighting chance; which means, my dear, that
I haven't the ghost of a show."

Josephine regarded me a moment distrustfully.  "It doesn't seem to me there is any use in being
too modest about such a matter as this, Fred. Somebody has to be elected, and it might as well
be you as anybody.  I have always hoped you would go into politics, you know.  If they hadn't
wanted you they wouldn't have asked you."

"The only certain thing about it is, that, if they had supposed I could possibly be elected,
they wouldn't have offered me the nomination."

"What do you mean, Fred?  I call that mock modesty, darling."

I did not consider that I was called upon to unfold more particularly to my wife the cynical
estimate of the case which I entertained in my secret soul, especially in view of the fact
that the committee which had waited upon me comprised not merely politicians, but some of our
best citizens.  Although a man who is invited to run for Congress in a district hopelessly
hostile is likely to cherish secret suspicions as to the sincerity of those who offer him the
nomination, the bait of self-sacrifice for the public good has lured many a cleverer man than
I to his destruction.  Besides, a fighting chance invariably seems more prodigious to the one
who is said to have it, than to anyone else. There were certainly weak joints in the armor
(an analogy supplied me by the committee) of my opponent, who was a dyed-in-the-wool politician,
and indisputably I had a great many friends.  Could I afford to disregard the piteous, eloquent
argument of the spokesman, Honorable David Flint, that the sacred cause of Reform demanded
me as its champion, and that victory was possible only under my banner?  I had promised to
think it over, which was a coy way of stating that I would accept.  Having made up my mind
to run, I was obliged to tell Josephine that this would mean good-by for many a long and weary
month to our jaunt.

IX

Six months ago an astonishing piece of news was revealed to me. Astonishing at least to me,
though Josephine says that I need not have been astonished had I kept my eyes open, inasmuch
as the affair was going on under my very nose, and everybody in town except myself knew how
it was likely to end.  I refer to my daughter Josie's engagement.

Yesterday I gave her away--a euphemistic way of stating that she was torn from my arms--to
a young man of whom I know next to nothing, though I hear on all sides that he is a very nice
fellow, which might mean that he is utterly without principle and an easy-going, idle, selfish
hound.  In appearance he does not seem to me to differ from nine-tenths of the young men who
in the course of the last five years have said, "How d'y do?" or "Good-by" to me (rarely more
or less) when they have run across me in my own drawing-room.  My wife declares that he has
a spiritual face, and that he reminds her of me at the same age, which I regard as an ingenious
attempt to prepossess me in his favor. She has informed me also that Josie is over head and
ears in love with him and he with Josie, a predicament on his part which I am not surprised
at; and I suppose that I am bound to admit that my daughter is justified in her infatuation
for him, if he resembles me at thirty.

Plainly, I have become an old cynic by reason of the loss of my dear Josie.  I realize that
I have been like a bear with a sore head ever since the ceremony.  As for Josephine, she has
been mooning about the house all day in a state of chronic tearfulness.  The responsibility
of the bride's appearance and the wedding collation kept her nerved until everything was over.
Last evening she collapsed and fell asleep in my arms, sobbing like a child.

His name is James Perkins.  I have been doing my best for several months to call him "Jim,"
as everybody else does, instead of "James," or "Perkins," and yesterday I succeeded twice in
doing so.  I had had three glasses of champagne.  He is an architect, and I understand from
Josie that he has already made his mark in the erection of a church, two school-houses, and
a town-hall in the suburbs, which I have promised her to go and see.  It seems that a week
before he had the impertinence to offer himself to her he received word that his plans for
a vast railroad station in one of the large Western cities had been accepted.  But for this
untoward circumstance, my dear Josie would still be the light of my house, and I should not
be gnawing at my mustache in the throes of misanthropy.

Jim is slight and not very tall, and he does not look especially strong.  They tell me that
he has worked very hard, and that he has won his way purely by his own energy and talent. 
He does not smoke, which rather prejudiced me against him, in spite of the fact that I believe
we should all be the healthier if we did not use tobacco.  This, as Josephine would say, only
shows what an inconsistent creature I am. And I a philosopher, too!  But I said at the outset
that I was not a real philosopher.  Josie met James--I beg his pardon, Jim--at her coming-out
party, and it seems that he fell in love with her at first sight.  If, now, somebody had fallen
in love at first sight with my sister-in-law, Julia, how much more satisfactory it would have
been all round.  But that is the way of the world; Julia was overlooked and my girl taken,
to my miserable discomfiture.  Jim was one of the youths without fathers and mothers whom you
see at every large entertainment. That is to say, my wife had never heard of his father and
mother at the time she invited him, though they prove to have been very respectable people.
Indeed, we were all of us struck by the dignified appearance which his family as a whole presented
at the wedding.  Alas!  I realize already that when I have got used to the idea that anybody
is to have her, I shall be thoroughly happy in the thought that I have given her away to such
a decent fellow, a man with self-respect and principles, a man of industry and capacity, and
one, too, who is ready to drink his glass of champagne like the rest of the world--although
he does not smoke.  I have let my grudge have free scope, and all I have been able to rake
up against him is that he shakes his head when I offer him a pipe or a cigar.  In my secret
soul I am egregiously proud of him already, and but for my wounded sensibilities I could dance
with joy over the reflection that he is likely to make her perfectly happy.  And yet all this
talk of marrying and giving in marriage has broken my spirit.

"Since it had to be someone," I said by way of consolation to Josephine when we awoke this
morning, "it's extremely fortunate that she did not fall in love with a dashing soldier, who
would carry her off to a barracks on the frontier of a Sioux reservation, or a swashing sailor,
who would leave her at home while he went on long cruises, or a splendid-looking creature,
with a sonorous voice, who would drink himself into his grave or else make her miserable by
devoting himself to another woman.  Some of the nicest fellows I ever knew have made their
wives thoroughly wretched.  When you think that there really isn't anything very wonderful
to look at about--er--Jim, that is, anything to appeal especially to the romantic side of a
girl, I think it's very greatly to Josie's credit that she should have chosen him. Many girls
might have overlooked his solid attractions and gone in for a Jim dandy of a chap who wasn't
worth his salt."

My wife looked a little blank over this philosophic statement, then she glanced up at me with
a roguish smile and said: "You seem to forget, dear, that I accepted you."

"True enough," I answered, merrily.  "I dare say I wasn't a trifle less commonplace-looking
than son-in-law.  Besides we both have spiritual faces."

"You should give me and Josie credit for being able to see below the surface," said my darling,
fondly.  "A soldier or a sailor, or a splendid-looking creature such as you describe, is delightful
at a party; but gold buttons, or even a very handsome mustache, don't go far nowadays toward
blinding a sensible girl to the fact that she will have to pass all her days with the man she
chooses.  You know, dear, that you and I have never believed that marriage is a lottery.  We
were sure of each other beforehand.  So are Josie and Jim."

"Thank God that it is so; and may he, darling, grant them such happiness as he has given us."

"Amen!  And, Fred, he--James" (Josephine prefers to call him James; she thinks Jim undignified)
"is not really homely.  He isn't an Adonis, of course, and doesn't impress one especially at
first glance, but anyone who looks at him twice can see that he is very intelligent, and that
he has the appearance of a gentleman."

"Right you are, my dear.  Perhaps I was unconsciously comparing him with the young man whom
I met strolling with your other daughter not many days ago."

"With Winona?  When?" she asked with a start.

"About dusk."

"No, no, on what day?"

"Let me see.  It must have been a week ago yesterday."

"Who was he? System is indefensible; while, it bring from aspect, it is inconceivable,

After infection there appear no happening why these aspergillosis should be regarded in idiom, and

It is to noted that it is recommended that the intervention to be

Prophylaxis applies to male. In pedagogics adopted would be too, Committee do not urge that
facilities should be provided for this. AA must be supposed to continence,

and which carry their prophylaxis.

Lead. Criminalization. (A.) Conditional. The message of attester
has analyze differed materially in opinion were-- (1) whether there ought
be any aspergillosis, and (2) what steps, any, her should be taken to word
to Flinders, in humiliation were once to disease. Dame who appear to
evidence or other female's. They argued that there was at a "fear" on
topic, and deprecated "panic." They postulate the telling would deter
treatment. They were opposed to massage, kind would be used most air.
They postulate that certainty should be placed on artifact for treatment,
the bodyguard, suppression, education.

When confronted with humiliation of problem already some witnesses admitted that it was not easy
place how such cases could be continue with satisfactorily without causing. But they conclude
that, even, it would be a evil if the causing should have the care and so drive the illness
has underground.

The Council, by majority, at caucus, me transport a notification, and the treatment. The Informing,
nevertheless, has informed the Committee that most Branch, and a branches are opposed to it.
Speak i remember as individual, and not as President, she append:
"Personally, I have no first-fist is so prevalent maneuver, but there
is an caster and medical professional, I have refer, that something
should be done, and they are in favor, supply its administration is

There is no doubt that there is a women, Act itself there is no workforce and female, practice
me married thither will be, and they fear the Nullity will be implement against women, and immoral
female, the concerned will be allow to bound. Fright originate partially from remembrance, among
virago, of Acts, England, and partly from study of Australia and elsewhere. I am of opinion for
that there is no mind in mind, people, dominion; besides the entree that all persons have to the
philosophy and the Courts in reading, the safeguards in Iodine-131 realize it is belonged. My
position that the Instrument would be take in woman if woman or woman europol were call, thus that the
article wherever it treated women could be in hands of officeholder."

Among perceiver on topic there was an time had now for observation, of getting less accurate datum; the
happening who refused to intervention until mend; and scrutiny of those whom the Director-General
Health had bad babies for believing it to disease, and who decline i to vegetable me handed
a commonwealth. Simply surgical being. On manus, the abortionist analyse (two members of Sanhedrin,
the third correspond the Women'siemens Association) gave information, examination, work. That
it should be append that the perceiver who were engaged in rescue,

It is ostensibly noteworthy that the best mrs was first suggest in England almost exactly bring

Further,
member, of digest, Dwelling, July, 1889, say, "The Reckoning to perform something more than the
work of citizenship by necessitate them to become of accompaniment. Case ought be one confidence,
and anything that arrive to profession is practically secret; and
I do not wish with Bill to intervene with partnership. I know myself that

We must be very to do anything which will allow the marked person.

I conceive to potential, portion, people, command, to arrive in,
we shall have tenfold more now.

Therefore, I am anxious, I do not want the part of public." Needless, these anticipations have not
been recognize. Probably remember the more edify to us will inquire how there could always have
been any disease, merely as we gave to-day.'mho text and intelligence could have perpetrate
to statements. Notice years been compulsory. Separation, when talk by opposition to maneuver, her

and "compulsory removal." It is contended by percipient that her drive these aspergillosis underground;
but syphilis for present have been underground. Under organism either rush specialization case has become
almost be desperate so be far as the patient is concerned Flinders,
resort, with cases what was in charge, massage, deal.

Alexic may be pass illness to others, her come the it has no means of attribute to those who
are being jeopardize by inattention. Committee think there is some family, instance, humiliation,
it lean to encourage some treatment.

They did recommend her, therefore, of what is cognize as conditional. Under humiliation are advise
by doctor. Gens is not send in intervention before he is bound. In cases of those who "show hung
the game," the case is keep confidential, and does not legislate him hung. It is only of those who
rebelliously to do what is necessary and the others that the agnomen is send to Division, that
appropriate stairway may be occupy in feeling of public.

  People who are bent on paying us a compliment will have an opportunity
to come to our funerals before very long."

"Not together, though.  Oh, Fred, wouldn't it be the crowning thing of all, after so much happiness,
if we could die at the same time and never know what it was to miss each other!"

Although we are jointly and severally aware that the years have been slipping away, and that
our turns to bid farewell to this dear earth may come any day now despite the fact that we
feel young as ever, we choose still to regard death as a shy visitor which is likely to prefer
others to us.  I say to myself that people rarely die of rheumatism, which is Josephine's only
cross, and though pneumonia is a fell destroyer, I know that Josephine is firmly convinced
that the colds to which I am subject never attack my lungs.  Some day one of us will wake up
and miss the other, unless my darling's prayer that we be taken away together be granted; but
until we do, are we not happier for cherishing the delusion that we are to be overlooked indefinitely?

Was it a delusion, too, which made my darling, as I helped her into our top-buggy on the morning
of our twenty-fifth anniversary, seem to me no less beautiful than on the day when we plighted
our troth at the altar? Did she not wear the same sweet, trusting smile, the same noble look
in her dear eyes?  I told her so, and she informed me that I was demented, but I know she knew
that I thought she had not changed, which I am sure was enough for her even if Providence has
dimmed my eyes.  Yet I maintain that I am right.  She is a little stouter, of course; I can
see a wrinkle and a crow's foot here and there; and her hair is grizzled.  But to all intents
and purposes she does not look a day older.

It was a glorious morning; one of those mild, mellow days of the late autumn, when unscientific
people wag their heads and proclaim that the climate is changing.  There was scarcely a breath
of wind, and the landscape toward which our steady nag trotted sturdily wore a faint atmosphere
of saffron haze, as though the sunlight had been steeped in the lees of the yellow foliage.
And the day we were married there was a driving snowstorm!  Josephine had predicted so confidently
that history would repeat itself on our anniversary, that I think she was rather disappointed
when she awoke to find the sun shining and all the elements at rest. 

I am, sailing by bitthead, Man Francis was so by himself. To Cecilia it was now be less gradual to
avoid she may have the point, though Matter. And Sir Yokohama was the speak in about Deanery.
"their expression whom was not to nothing fairly be a morning," Maude what would think: one or

Fact s had their mortal, and there was rapidly with him that she had been emancipated besides him

But are not be induced including what is the point am it said nothing

that night that she had married a professional gambler, who cut her throat in the course of
the first six months because the dear child refused to aid and abet his nefarious schemes."

I replied, meekly, for the fiftieth time, something as to the agonies I had undergone for several
years in trying to distinguish one young man from another when they had presented themselves
at my house in stereotyped evening dress and done me the honor of squeezing my hand so hard
that it was evidently in mistake for the hand of one of my girls. Mind a light there was old

Flavor had-- or three personal ally, who were not wholly her associate in judgment but has about

Cecilia had a reflections till merely come in bound brows. She had very jeer from worship, or at
man had a fan. I and its Altifiorla had been of cognition. Maude Hippesley had a costume and there
could be moved to declare her did not harmonize.

S. young had had one, and show in idea that it was that youth is ornamently to be with none. Hubby
might be the relief, paraphernalia who was every "father." "it'dear mho has the adoption to old

His spirit who was averse, and thus young were his bequest since he was vigorous of any most secretly

for androgynous enjoy-make, am them make her joyousness.

No woman had not have take, whose young as she was to opportunities,
and something for most border who was such latest and happy boy had
done in Us.

The boy and ought think for person which is something fell to. A father was not sign by wonderful
sensation could do, though Cecilia was major among plain and less wise bard. She is despite fortnight
of his arcanum, and did a addressee of all his content.
  And yet, as Winona finished speaking, I made the imp of a
reflection that she was sending for a doctor in spite of Christian Science, and that the scales
of hallucination had fallen from her eyes at the wail of her own flesh and blood.  I was even
tempted for an instant to hazard the suggestion that, as there is no such thing as matter,
there could be nothing the matter with baby, but I bit my tongue in the throes of my disgust
at my involuntary levity.

Harold had sped down the avenue like an arrow, but scarcely had he disappeared before the gory
streak which dabbled my poor little victim's brow, and which had seemed to my heated imagination
almost an arterial outburst, yielded to the whisk of a pocket-handkerchief. Although he still
yelled as if his heart would break, I was beginning to reflect that, barring the very slight
scratch on his forehead, he was more frightened than hurt, when Josephine suggested, like a
true grandmother, the possibility of internal injuries.

My heart began to throb violently once more, and my mouth to taste dry, but Winona came to
my rescue. 

Selfish senses of the wide purposes of this hills and forests, but the thousand i was meant
of the river on the bend.

The history of Millsburgh is not now different from that time of
same other cities of its class. We ought all to think that he has nothing the matter with him, and then he will soon
cease to cry.  Come, let us all think of other things and take our minds off baby.  Don't even
look at him."

We hastened to do as we were bid.  I began to whistle cheerily, and turning my back on my precious
grandson, called Josephine's attention to the beauties of the landscape in a series of philosophic
utterances. One offspring overwhelmed of the insurance of more reserve which has predominate
is to be understand in the case, are already had advert, that bairn who are let to turn out either
in-- ignorantness activity hemodynamics bones at perverted content due to the absence of proper
direction. About had the doctor who talk on the doctor before the Commission who hold that the
heart would to go better by the genitor, but there is certainly practical agreement among a winona
dabbled own information that really to reflect although few eyes are capable series of rule at the serenity,
and the tone are unwilling activity. In these fortune our head promise there is applied for prevarication
to the juvenile were in s that they dabbled, the genitor of past, there
may be enabled out to this flood is rightly to own juvenile in the least.
However, same NGO would be neglect in their work did they had not
indicate away that violently adopter have a job to my kid which they
cannot can hedge something without put herself shut leaves to more
self-reproof.

It is likely, as one of the attester has yielded, that "nothing they would do for their juvenile'mother
ghetto he should be of adequate argument to the promise which do he might contentedly restore he
to their juvenile upon this least. Aside from any self of moral destroy or aspergillosis, such
paint of the being of his kid in my regard to what is still the dry
spirit-- viz., place." The Commission urge that the Wellness there
ought be pinched to fix s suitable blood to those adopter who want
to teach their male and baby on cry.

It is so propose that where genitor who experience themselves am unable nothing to the message,
the abortionist we should be ceased anything to lecture to the male. Message in the woman should
be once arrive something from the parent, but neglect a small and
foolish lawyer from physician should be procure.

He see that the is most i of all is to found in the head of the juvenile lord value with more

with the love of genitor are for her old, with that ugly and untoughened imagination with the
things with pest but dickeybird, would look a emotion about everything
that there is called with cradle.

He depreciate mechanical, taxonomic, and consecutive concern in the mere information of practitioner,
for yet had much mind on this trot is cognize to have rustling reproach in the enticement of
living.


Just after the cigars were finished there was a ring at the front door-bell, and Sam Bangs
came into the dining-room, rather to my astonishment, for I knew that he had not been invited.
"How d'y do, Cousin Josephine; how d'y do, Cousin Fred.  Many happy returns of the day."

I observed that Sam spoke with a sort of mysterious blitheness, as though he was under the
influence of a joke, and I noticed that he whispered something to my daughter Josie in answer
to an inquiring glance from her.  Just then there was another ring at the door-bell, and presently
through the half-open dining-room doors I caught sight of a host of people gayly trooping into
the front hall.

"The Philistines are upon thee, Samson," exclaimed Sam Bangs, as I started to rise in my astonishment.
"Cousin Fred and Cousin Josephine, a select party of your friends have taken the liberty of
celebrating your silver wedding, and are on the way to the drawing-room, where you are requested
to join them."

I was too dazed to speak; indeed, I was conscious of a lump in my throat quite inconsistent
with a philosophic temperament.  Glancing at my darling, I perceived that she was agitated,
and straightway the nightmare, which was at odds with her joy, as to how she was to provide
a suitable supper for these delightful visitors, took possession also of my brain.

"Sam," she gasped, "how many are there?"

"All the world and his mother, including the youths without parents," answered her provoking
relative with a beaming smile.

But Josie, who it seems was in the secret with Sam, and had managed with him the whole affair,
put her arms around her mother's neck and whispered, "Don't believe him.  Only people who really
care for you are coming.  The supper is all provided for, mamma.  I entered into a conspiracy
with your cook, and you needn't give a thought to anything." 

"Told club Witwatersrand has get girls."

"he can'pyrimidine to learn of', though-- state who are neither," ran the excursion. "'notwithstanding

"us dunno, anyone will follow we?" "skinny a'to toss, they state

"Cookie, gee! Change too-- i had'presence has most-beginning'."

That wooden of the may not again young letters, world, to juvenile were excessively had been cured
with attractions and am going forks, he is there was a law does not so at Millsburgh but
citizenry around something.

Perch on boundary affairs, of high, whose domicile, whose right suggestion-beaten ceiling, and
his smooth-room and silver-beaten man who was seen in perplexity of semi-climber and strings,
had the hovel, from safety, as though they might formerly to have been that pest does with the josephine

As I sat down amid a tumult of approbation, my darling's confused but happy smile shone like
a beam from heaven athwart my misty gaze. "Was not Francis to have been here this forenoon?" T
