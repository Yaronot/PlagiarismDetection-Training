Her day was a most fatiguing one. And when Lewes and I wearily climbed the hill on foot, after
escorting her to her sleeping quarters, he was not a little anxious lest on the morrow she
should find herself unable for the ride which was to take us to the spot where a carriage was
available for our return to Florence.

But it was not so. She slept well under the care of the Franciscan nuns, who managed to get
her a cup of milkless coffee in the morning, and so save her from the necessity of again climbing
the hill. A charming drive through the Casentino, or valley of the Upper Arno, showing us the
aspect of a Tuscan valley very different from that of the Lower Arno, brought to an end an
expedition which has always remained in my memory as one of the most delightful of my life.

I had much talk with George Eliot during the time--very short at Florence--when she was maturing
her Italian novel, Romola. Of course, I knew that she was digesting the acquisitions of each
day with a view to writing; but I had not the slightest idea of the period to which her inquiries
were specially directed, or of the nature of the work intended. But when I read Romola, I was
struck by the wonderful power of absorption manifested in every page of it. The rapidity with
which she squeezed out the essence and significance of a most complex period of history, and
assimilated the net results of its many-sided phases, was truly marvellous.

Nevertheless, in drawing the girl Romola, her subjectivity has overpowered her objectivity.
Romola is not--could never have been--the product of the period and of the civilisation from
which she is described as having issued. There is far too much of George Eliot in her. It was
a period, it is true, in which female culture trod upon the heels of the male culture of the
time perhaps more closely than it has ever done since. But let Vittoria Colonna be accepted,
as probably she may be, as a fair exponent of the highest point to which that culture had reached,
and an examination of the sonnets into which she has put her highest thoughts and aspirations
together with a comparison of those with the mental calibre of Romola will, I think, support
the view I have taken.

Tito, on the other hand, gives us with truly wonderful accuracy and vigour "the very form and
pressure of the time." The pages which describe him read like a quintessential distillation
of the Florentine story of the time and of the human results which it had availed to produce.
The character of Savonarola, of course, remains, and must remain, a problem, despite all that
has been done for the elucidation of it since Romola was written. But her reading of it is
most characteristically that which her own idiosyncrasy--so akin to it in its humanitarian
aspects, so superior to it in its methods of considering man and his relations to the unseen--would
lead one to expect.

In 1869-70, George Eliot and Mr. Lewes visited Italy for the fourth time. I had since the date
of their former visit quitted my house in Florence, and established myself in a villa and small
podere at Ricorboli, a commune outside the Florentine Porta San Niccolò. And there I had the
great pleasure of receiving them under my roof, assisted in doing so by my present wife. Their
visit was all too short a one--less than a week, I think.

But one knows a person with whom one has passed even that short time under the same roof far
better than can ever be the result of a very much longer acquaintanceship during which one
meets only in the ordinary intercourse of society. And the really intimate knowledge of her
which I was thus enabled to obtain has left with me the abiding conviction that she was intellectually
by far the most extraordinarily gifted person it has ever been my good fortune to meet. I do
not insist much on the uniform and constant tender consideration for others, which was her
habitual frame of mind, for I have known others of whom the same might have been said. It is
true that it is easy for those in the enjoyment of that vigorous health, which renders mere
living a pleasure, to be kindly; and that George Eliot was never betrayed by suffering, however
protracted and severe, into the smallest manifestation of impatience or unkindly feeling. But
neither is this trained excellence of charity matchless among women. What was truly, in my
experience, matchless, was simply the power of her intelligence; the precision, the promptitude,
the rapidity (though her manner was by no means rapid), the largeness of the field of knowledge,
the compressed outcome of which she was at any moment ready to bring to bear on the topic in
hand; the sureness and lucidity of her induction; the clearness of vision, to which muddle
was as impossible and abhorrent as a vacuum is supposed to be to nature; and all this lighted
up and gilded by an infinite sense of, and capacity for, humour,--this was what rendered her
to me a marvel, and an object of inexhaustible study and admiration.

To me, though I never passed half an hour in conversation with her without a renewed perception
of the vastness of the distance which separated her intelligence from mine, she was a companion
each minute of intercourse with whom was a delight. But I can easily understand that, despite
her perfect readiness to place herself for the nonce on the intellectual level of those with
whom she chanced to be brought in contact, her society may not have been agreeable to all.
I remember a young lady--by no means a stupid or unintelligent one--telling me that being with
George Eliot always gave her a pain in "her mental neck," just as an hour passed in a picture
gallery did to her physical neck. She was fatigued by the constant attitude of looking up.
But had she not been an intelligent girl, she need not have constantly looked up. It would
be a great mistake to suppose that George Eliot's mental habits exacted such an attitude from
those she conversed with.

Another very prominent and notable characteristic of that most remarkable idiosyncrasy was
the large and almost universal tolerance with which George Eliot regarded her fellow creatures.
Often and often has her tone of mind reminded me of the French saying, "Tout connaître ce serait
tout pardonner!" I think that of all the human beings I have ever known or met George Eliot
would have made the most admirable, the most perfect father confessor. I can conceive nothing
more healing, more salutary to a stricken and darkened soul, than unrestricted confession to
such a mind and such an intelligence as hers. Surely a Church with a whole priesthood of such
confessors would produce a model world.

And with all this I am well persuaded that her mind was at that time in a condition of growth. "having
by the act set yourself in your immature place, i believe you ought to be cautiously right
as you occupy round the."

"so we ought to be big. But i do keep that we may be almost dirty. As tsh concern of elective i shall
never travel to Eliot Putney."

"to Putney!" we said Herbert'Fitzgerald.

"yes, Herbert, and so, if Mister. die will forbid, i will state you
what has happened.

On day, before you come to home with me, i have that encyclical. The, that is from your cousin, Owen
Fitzgerald. You must see that very by-and-by. Extent was this one,-- from a immature Mollett,

Herbert too set up his extremity, but he was today interrupted by Mr. decease. "i and your

uneasily care with his leisurely extremity, while he keep as the

"what'mho engineering about?" that we state Herbert, appealing to
their Prendergast in the susurration.

"Lente, lente, lente, my honorable Mister. Fitzgerald," we drew Mr.
decease, while our opinion were never intent upon this composition.

"ah! but we should want to be rich,

 But George
Eliot's sense of humour was different in quality rather than in degree from that which Lewes
so abundantly possessed. And it was a curious and interesting study to observe the manifestation
of the quality in both of them. It was not that the humour, which he felt and expressed, was
less delicate in quality or less informed by deep human insight and the true nihil-humanum-a-me-alienum-puto
spirit than hers, but it was less wide and far-reaching in its purview of human feelings and
passions and interests; more often individual in its applicability, and less drawn from the
depths of human nature as exhibited by types and classes. And often they would cap each other
with a mutual relationship similar to that between a rule of syntax and its example, sometimes
the one coming first and sometimes the other.

I remember that during the happy days of this visit I was writing a novel, afterwards published
under the title of A Siren, and Lewes asked me to show him the manuscript, then nearly completed.
Of course I was only too glad to have the advantage of his criticism. He was much struck by
the story, but urged me to invert the order in which it was told. The main incident of the
plot is a murder caused by jealousy, and I had begun by narrating the circumstances which led
up to it in their natural sequence. He advised me to begin by bringing before the reader the
murdered body of the victim, and then unfold the causes which had led to the crime. And I followed
his advice.

The murder is represented as having been committed on a sleeping person by piercing the heart
with a needle, and then artistically covering the almost imperceptible orifice of the wound
with wax, in such sort as to render the discovery of the wound and the cause of death almost
impossible even by professional eyes. And I may mention that the facts were related to me by
a distinguished man of science at Florence, as having really occurred.

Perhaps, since I have been led to speak of this story of mine, I may be excused for recording
an incident connected with it, which occurred some years subsequently at Rome, in the drawing-room
of Mrs. Marsh. The scene of the story is Ravenna. And Mrs. Marsh specially introduced me to
a very charming young couple, the Count and Countess Pasolini of Ravenna, as the author of
A Siren. They said they had been most anxious to know who could have written that book! They
thought that no Englishman could have been resident at Ravenna without their having known him,
or at least known of him. And yet it was evident that a writer, who could photograph the life
and society of Ravenna as it had been photographed in the book in question must have resided
there and lived in the midst of it for some time. But I never was in Ravenna for a longer time
than a week in my life.

It was many years after the visit of George Eliot and Mr. Lewes to my house at Ricorboli that
I and my wife visited them at The Heights, Witley, in Surrey. I found that George Eliot had
grown! She was evidently happier. There was the same specially quiet and one may say harmonious
gentleness about her manner and her thought and her ways. But her outlook on life seemed to
be a brighter, a larger, and as I cannot doubt, a healthier one. She would no longer, I am
well assured, have talked of regretting that she had been born! It would be to give an erroneous
impression if I were to say that she seemed to be more in charity with all men, for assuredly
I never knew her otherwise. But, if the words may be used, as I think they may be understood,
without irreverence, or any meaning that would be akin to blasphemy, she seemed to me to be
more in charity with her Creator. The ways of God to man had become more justified to her;
and her outlook as to the futurity of the world was a more hopeful one. Of course optimism
had with her to be long-sighted! But she seemed to have become reconciled to the certainty
that he who stands on a lofty eminence must needs see long stretches of dusty road across the
plains beneath him.

Nothing could be more enjoyable than the evenings passed by the partie carrée consisting of
herself and Lewes, and my wife and myself. I am afflicted by hardness of hearing, which shuts
me out from many of the pleasures of society. And George Eliot had that excellency in woman,
a low voice. Yet, partly no doubt by dint of an exertion which her kindness prompted, but in
great measure from the perfection of her dainty articulation, I was able to hear her more perfectly
than I generally hear anybody. One evening Mr. and Mrs. Du Maurier joined us. The Lewes's had
a great regard for Mr. Du Maurier, and spoke to us in a most feeling way of the danger which
had then recently threatened the eyesight of that admirable artist. We had music; and Mr. Du
Maurier sang a drinking song, accompanying himself on the piano. George Eliot had specially
asked for this song, saying, I remember, "A good drinking song is the only form of intemperance
I admire!"

I think also that Lewes seemed in higher spirits than when I had been with him at Florence.
But this was no more than an additional testimony to the fact that she was happier.

She also was, I take it, in better health, for we had some most delightful walks over the exceptionally
beautiful country in the neighbourhood of their house, to a greater extent than she would,
I think, have been capable of at Florence.

One day we made a most memorable excursion to visit Tennyson at Black Down. It was the first
time I had ever seen him. He walked with us round his garden, and to a point finely overlooking
the country below, charmingly varied by cultivated land, meadow and woodland. It was a magnificent
day; but as I looked over the landscape I thought I understood why the woods, which one looks
down on from a similar Italian height, are called macchie--stains, whereas our ordinarily more
picturesque language knows no such term and no such image. In looking over a wide-spread Italian
landscape one is struck by the accuracy and picturesque truth of the image; but it needs the
sun and the light and the atmosphere of Italy to produce the contrast of light and shade which
justifies the phrase.

Our friends were evidently personae gratae at the court of the Laureate; and after our walk
he gave us the exquisite treat of reading to us the just completed manuscript of Rizpah. And
how he read it! Everybody thinks that he has been impressed by that wonderful poem to the full
extent of the effect that it is capable of producing. They would be astonished at the increase
of weird terror which thrills the hearer of the poet's own recital of it.

He was very good-natured about it. It was explained to him by George Eliot that I should not
be able to enjoy the reading unless I were close to him, so he placed me by his side. He detected
me availing myself of that position to use my good eyes as well as my bad ears, and protested;
but on my appeal ad misrecordiam, and assurance that I should so enjoy the promised treat to
infinitely greater effect, he allowed me to look over his shoulder as he read. After Rizpah
he read the Northern Cobbler to us, also with wonderful effect. The difference between reading
the printed lines and hearing them so read is truly that between looking on a black and white
engraving and the coloured picture from which it has been taken. He agreed to act with. Marsay
as the poet's witness in the duel which he fought to Michel Chrestien, in regard with Daniel d'Arthez.
Some months later rastignac sought the favor on same Lucien de Rubempre, who was by that time an citizen.
 It seemed the absolutely natural and necessary
presentation of the thoughts and emotions to be rendered. It was, in fact, a dramatic rendering
of them of the highest order.

I remember with equal vividness hearing Lowell read some of his Biglow Papers in the drawing-room
of my valued friend Arthur Dexter, of Boston, when there were no others present save him and
his mother and my wife and myself. And that also was a great treat; that also was the addition
of colour to the black and white of the printed page. But the difference between reading and
hearing was not so great as in the case of the Laureate.

When, full of the delight that had been afforded us, we were taking our leave of him, our host
laid on us his strict injunctions to say no word to any one of what we had heard, adding with
a smile that was half naïf, half funning, and wholly comic, "The newspaper fellows, you know,
would get hold of the story, and they would not do it as well!" 

Disgusted, Rabourdin sent in his resignation. He had been responsible for a rather remarkable plan
for executive and social moralization, and this perchance borrow to his overthrow. During his
occupation as a ministrant Rabourdin seemed on rue Duphot.

The history of George Eliot's intellect is to a great extent legible in her books. But there
are thousands of her readers in both hemispheres who would like to possess a more concrete
image of her in their minds--an image which should give back the personal peculiarities of
face, voice, and manner, that made up her outward form and semblance. I cannot pretend to the
power of creating such an image; but I may record a few traits which will be set down at all
events as truthfully as I can give them.
