All this interrupts the music for not more than a minute or two. Then again the merciless tune
begins--the tune that has been played for the last half-hour without one single change. It
is an American tune this time, one which they have picked up on the streets; all seem to know
the words of it--or, at any rate, the first line of it, which they hum to themselves, over
and over again without rest: "In the good old summertime--in the good old summertime! In the
good old summertime--in the good old summertime!" There seems to be something hypnotic about
this, with its endlessly recurring dominant. It has put a stupor upon every one who hears it,
as well as upon the men who are playing it. No one can get away from it, or even think of getting
away from it; it is three o'clock in the morning, and they have danced out all their joy, and
danced out all their strength, and all the strength that unlimited drink can lend them--and
still there is no one among them who has the power to think of stopping. Promptly at seven
o'clock this same Monday morning they will every one of them have to be in their places at
Durham's or Brown's or Jones's, each in his working clothes. If one of them be a minute late,
he will be docked an hour's pay, and if he be many minutes late, he will be apt to find his
brass check turned to the wall, which will send him out to join the hungry mob that waits every
morning at the gates of the packing houses, from six o'clock until nearly half-past eight.
There is no exception to this rule, not even little Ona--who has asked for a holiday the day
after her wedding day, a holiday without pay, and been refused. While there are so many who
are anxious to work as you wish, there is no occasion for incommoding yourself with those who
must work otherwise.

Little Ona is nearly ready to faint--and half in a stupor herself, because of the heavy scent
in the room. She has not taken a drop, but every one else there is literally burning alcohol,
as the lamps are burning oil; some of the men who are sound asleep in their chairs or on the
floor are reeking of it so that you cannot go near them. Now and then Jurgis gazes at her hungrily--he
has long since forgotten his shyness; but then the crowd is there, and he still waits and watches
the door, where a carriage is supposed to come. It does not, and finally he will wait no longer,
but comes up to Ona, who turns white and trembles. He puts her shawl about her and then his
own coat. They live only two blocks away, and Jurgis does not care about the carriage.

There is almost no farewell--the dancers do not notice them, and all of the children and many
of the old folks have fallen asleep of sheer exhaustion. Dede Antanas is asleep, and so are
the Szedvilases, husband and wife, the former snoring in octaves. There is Teta Elzbieta, and
Marija, sobbing loudly; and then there is only the silent night, with the stars beginning to
pale a little in the east. Jurgis, without a word, lifts Ona in his arms, and strides out with
her, and she sinks her head upon his shoulder with a moan. When he reaches home he is not sure
whether she has fainted or is asleep, but when he has to hold her with one hand while he unlocks
the door, he sees that she has opened her eyes.

"You shall not go to Brown's today, little one," he whispers, as he climbs the stairs; and
she catches his arm in terror, gasping: "No! No! I dare not! It will ruin us!"

But he answers her again: "Leave it to me; leave it to me. I will earn more money--I will work
harder."

Chapter 2

Jurgis talked lightly about work, because he was young. They told him stories about the breaking
down of men, there in the stockyards of Chicago, and of what had happened to them afterward--stories
to make your flesh creep, but Jurgis would only laugh. He had only been there four months,
and he was young, and a giant besides. There was too much health in him. He could not even
imagine how it would feel to be beaten. "That is well enough for men like you," he would say,
"silpnas, puny fellows--but my back is broad."

Jurgis was like a boy, a boy from the country. He was the sort of man the bosses like to get
hold of, the sort they make it a grievance they cannot get hold of. When he was told to go
to a certain place, he would go there on the run. When he had nothing to do for the moment,
he would stand round fidgeting, dancing, with the overflow of energy that was in him. If he
were working in a line of men, the line always moved too slowly for him, and you could pick
him out by his impatience and restlessness. That was why he had been picked out on one important
occasion; for Jurgis had stood outside of Brown and Company's "Central Time Station" not more
than half an hour, the second day of his arrival in Chicago, before he had been beckoned by
one of the bosses. Of this he was very proud, and it made him more disposed than ever to laugh
at the pessimists. In vain would they all tell him that there were men in that crowd from which
he had been chosen who had stood there a month--yes, many months--and not been chosen yet.
"Yes," he would say, "but what sort of men? Broken-down tramps and good-for-nothings, fellows
who have spent all their money drinking, and want to get more for it. Do you want me to believe
that with these arms"--and he would clench his fists and hold them up in the air, so that you
might see the rolling muscles--"that with these arms people will ever let me starve?"

"It is plain," they would answer to this, "that you have come from the country, and from very
far in the country." And this was the fact, for Jurgis had never seen a city, and scarcely
even a fair-sized town, until he had set out to make his fortune in the world and earn his
right to Ona. His father, and his father's father before him, and as many ancestors back as
legend could go, had lived in that part of Lithuania known as Brelovicz, the Imperial Forest.
This is a great tract of a hundred thousand acres, which from time immemorial has been a hunting
preserve of the nobility. There are a very few peasants settled in it, holding title from ancient
times; and one of these was Antanas Rudkus, who had been reared himself, and had reared his
children in turn, upon half a dozen acres of cleared land in the midst of a wilderness. There
had been one son besides Jurgis, and one sister. The former had been drafted into the army;
that had been over ten years ago, but since that day nothing had ever been heard of him. The
sister was married, and her husband had bought the place when old Antanas had decided to go
with his son.

It was nearly a year and a half ago that Jurgis had met Ona, at a horse fair a hundred miles
from home. Jurgis had never expected to get married--he had laughed at it as a foolish trap
for a man to walk into; but here, without ever having spoken a word to her, with no more than
the exchange of half a dozen smiles, he found himself, purple in the face with embarrassment
and terror, asking her parents to sell her to him for his wife--and offering his father's two
horses he had been sent to the fair to sell. But Ona's father proved as a rock--the girl was
yet a child, and he was a rich man, and his daughter was not to be had in that way. So Jurgis
went home with a heavy heart, and that spring and summer toiled and tried hard to forget. In
the fall, after the harvest was over, he saw that it would not do, and tramped the full fortnight's
journey that lay between him and Ona.

He found an unexpected state of affairs--for the girl's father had died, and his estate was
tied up with creditors; Jurgis' heart leaped as he realized that now the prize was within his
reach. There was Elzbieta Lukoszaite, Teta, or Aunt, as they called her, Ona's stepmother,
and there were her six children, of all ages. There was also her brother Jonas, a dried-up
little man who had worked upon the farm. They were people of great consequence, as it seemed
to Jurgis, fresh out of the woods; Ona knew how to read, and knew many other things that he
did not know, and now the farm had been sold, and the whole family was adrift--all they owned
in the world being about seven hundred rubles which is half as many dollars. They would have
had three times that, but it had gone to court, and the judge had decided against them, and
it had cost the balance to get him to change his decision.

Ona might have married and left them, but she would not, for she loved Teta Elzbieta. It was
Jonas who suggested that they all go to America, where a friend of his had gotten rich. He
would work, for his part, and the women would work, and some of the children, doubtless--they
would live somehow. Jurgis, too, had heard of America. That was a country where, they said,
a man might earn three rubles a day; and Jurgis figured what three rubles a day would mean,
with prices as they were where he lived, and decided forthwith that he would go to America
and marry, and be a rich man in the bargain. In that country, rich or poor, a man was free,
it was said; he did not have to go into the army, he did not have to pay out his money to rascally
officials--he might do as he pleased, and count himself as good as any other man. So America
was a place of which lovers and young people dreamed. If one could only manage to get the price
of a passage, he could count his troubles at an end.

It was arranged that they should leave the following spring, and meantime Jurgis sold himself
to a contractor for a certain time, and tramped nearly four hundred miles from home with a
gang of men to work upon a railroad in Smolensk. This was a fearful experience, with filth
and bad food and cruelty and overwork; but Jurgis stood it and came out in fine trim, and with
eighty rubles sewed up in his coat. He did not drink or fight, because he was thinking all
the time of Ona; and for the rest, he was a quiet, steady man, who did what he was told to,
did not lose his temper often, and when he did lose it made the offender anxious that he should
not lose it again. When they paid him off he dodged the company gamblers and dramshops, and
so they tried to kill him; but he escaped, and tramped it home, working at odd jobs, and sleeping
always with one eye open.

So in the summer time they had all set out for America. At the last moment there joined them
Marija Berczynskas, who was a cousin of Ona's. Marija was an orphan, and had worked since childhood
for a rich farmer of Vilna, who beat her regularly. It was only at the age of twenty that it
had occurred to Marija to try her strength, when she had risen up and nearly murdered the man,
and then come away.

There were twelve in all in the party, five adults and six children--and Ona, who was a little
of both. They had a hard time on the passage; there was an agent who helped them, but he proved
a scoundrel, and got them into a trap with some officials, and cost them a good deal of their
precious money, which they clung to with such horrible fear. This happened to them again in
New York--for, of course, they knew nothing about the country, and had no one to tell them,
and it was easy for a man in a blue uniform to lead them away, and to take them to a hotel
and keep them there, and make them pay enormous charges to get away. The law says that the
rate card shall be on the door of a hotel, but it does not say that it shall be in Lithuanian.

It was in the stockyards that Jonas' friend had gotten rich, and so to Chicago the party was
bound. They knew that one word, Chicago and that was all they needed to know, at least, until
they reached the city. Then, tumbled out of the cars without ceremony, they were no better
off than before; they stood staring down the vista of Dearborn Street, with its big black buildings
towering in the distance, unable to realize that they had arrived, and why, when they said
"Chicago," people no longer pointed in some direction, but instead looked perplexed, or laughed,
or went on without paying any attention. They were pitiable in their helplessness; above all
things they stood in deadly terror of any sort of person in official uniform, and so whenever
they saw a policeman they would cross the street and hurry by. For the whole of the first day
they wandered about in the midst of deafening confusion, utterly lost; and it was only at night
that, cowering in the doorway of a house, they were finally discovered and taken by a policeman
to the station. In the morning an interpreter was found, and they were taken and put upon a
car, and taught a new word--"stockyards." Their delight at discovering that they were to get
out of this adventure without losing another share of their possessions it would not be possible
to describe.

They sat and stared out of the window. They were on a street which seemed to run on forever,
mile after mile--thirty-four of them, if they had known it--and each side of it one uninterrupted
row of wretched little two-story frame buildings. Down every side street they could see, it
was the same--never a hill and never a hollow, but always the same endless vista of ugly and
dirty little wooden buildings. Here and there would be a bridge crossing a filthy creek, with
hard-baked mud shores and dingy sheds and docks along it; here and there would be a railroad
crossing, with a tangle of switches, and locomotives puffing, and rattling freight cars filing
by; here and there would be a great factory, a dingy building with innumerable windows in it,
and immense volumes of smoke pouring from the chimneys, darkening the air above and making
filthy the earth beneath. But after each of these interruptions, the desolate procession would
begin again--the procession of dreary little buildings.

A full hour before the party reached the city they had begun to note the perplexing changes
in the atmosphere. It grew darker all the time, and upon the earth the grass seemed to grow
less green. Every minute, as the train sped on, the colors of things became dingier; the fields
were grown parched and yellow, the landscape hideous and bare. And along with the thickening
smoke they began to notice another circumstance, a strange, pungent odor. They were not sure
that it was unpleasant, this odor; some might have called it sickening, but their taste in
odors was not developed, and they were only sure that it was curious. Now, sitting in the trolley
car, they realized that they were on their way to the home of it--that they had traveled all
the way from Lithuania to it. It was now no longer something far off and faint, that you caught
in whiffs; you could literally taste it, as well as smell it--you could take hold of it, almost,
and examine it at your leisure. They were divided in their opinions about it. It was an elemental
odor, raw and crude; it was rich, almost rancid, sensual, and strong. There were some who drank
it in as if it were an intoxicant; there were others who put their handkerchiefs to their faces.
The new emigrants were still tasting it, lost in wonder, when suddenly the car came to a halt,
and the door was flung open, and a voice shouted--"Stockyards!"

They were left standing upon the corner, staring; down a side street there were two rows of
brick houses, and between them a vista: half a dozen chimneys, tall as the tallest of buildings,
touching the very sky--and leaping from them half a dozen columns of smoke, thick, oily, and
black as night. It might have come from the center of the world, this smoke, where the fires
of the ages still smolder. It came as if self-impelled, driving all before it, a perpetual
explosion. It was inexhaustible; one stared, waiting to see it stop, but still the great streams
rolled out. They spread in vast clouds overhead, writhing, curling; then, uniting in one giant
river, they streamed away down the sky, stretching a black pall as far as the eye could reach.

Then the party became aware of another strange thing. This, too, like the color, was a thing
elemental; it was a sound, a sound made up of ten thousand little sounds. You scarcely noticed
it at first--it sunk into your consciousness, a vague disturbance, a trouble. It was like the
murmuring of the bees in the spring, the whisperings of the forest; it suggested endless activity,
the rumblings of a world in motion. It was only by an effort that one could realize that it
was made by animals, that it was the distant lowing of ten thousand cattle, the distant grunting
of ten thousand swine.

They would have liked to follow it up, but, alas, they had no time for adventures just then.
The policeman on the corner was beginning to watch them; and so, as usual, they started up
the street. Scarcely had they gone a block, however, before Jonas was heard to give a cry,
and began pointing excitedly across the street. Before they could gather the meaning of his
breathless ejaculations he had bounded away, and they saw him enter a shop, over which was
a sign: "J. Szedvilas, Delicatessen." When he came out again it was in company with a very
stout gentleman in shirt sleeves and an apron, clasping Jonas by both hands and laughing hilariously.
Then Teta Elzbieta recollected suddenly that Szedvilas had been the name of the mythical friend
who had made his fortune in America. To find that he had been making it in the delicatessen
business was an extraordinary piece of good fortune at this juncture; though it was well on
in the morning, they had not breakfasted, and the children were beginning to whimper.

Thus was the happy ending to a woeful voyage. The two families literally fell upon each other's
necks--for it had been years since Jokubas Szedvilas had met a man from his part of Lithuania.
Before half the day they were lifelong friends. Jokubas understood all the pitfalls of this
new world, and could explain all of its mysteries; he could tell them the things they ought
to have done in the different emergencies--and what was still more to the point, he could tell
them what to do now. He would take them to poni Aniele, who kept a boardinghouse the other
side of the yards; old Mrs. Jukniene, he explained, had not what one would call choice accommodations,
but they might do for the moment. To this Teta Elzbieta hastened to respond that nothing could
be too cheap to suit them just then; for they were quite terrified over the sums they had had
to expend. A very few days of practical experience in this land of high wages had been sufficient
to make clear to them the cruel fact that it was also a land of high prices, and that in it
the poor man was almost as poor as in any other corner of the earth; and so there vanished
in a night all the wonderful dreams of wealth that had been haunting Jurgis. What had made
the discovery all the more painful was that they were spending, at American prices, money which
they had earned at home rates of wages--and so were really being cheated by the world! The
last two days they had all but starved themselves--it made them quite sick to pay the prices
that the railroad people asked them for food.

Yet, when they saw the home of the Widow Jukniene they could not but recoil, even so, in all
their journey they had seen nothing so bad as this. Poni Aniele had a four-room flat in one
of that wilderness of two-story frame tenements that lie "back of the yards." There were four
such flats in each building, and each of the four was a "boardinghouse" for the occupancy of
foreigners--Lithuanians, Poles, Slovaks, or Bohemians. Some of these places were kept by private
persons, some were cooperative. There would be an average of half a dozen boarders to each
room--sometimes there were thirteen or fourteen to one room, fifty or sixty to a flat. Each
one of the occupants furnished his own accommodations--that is, a mattress and some bedding.
The mattresses would be spread upon the floor in rows--and there would be nothing else in the
place except a stove. It was by no means unusual for two men to own the same mattress in common,
one working by day and using it by night, and the other working at night and using it in the
daytime. Very frequently a lodging house keeper would rent the same beds to double shifts of men.

Mrs. Jukniene was a wizened-up little woman, with a wrinkled face. Her home was unthinkably
filthy; you could not enter by the front door at all, owing to the mattresses, and when you
tried to go up the backstairs you found that she had walled up most of the porch with old boards
to make a place to keep her chickens. It was a standing jest of the boarders that Aniele cleaned
house by letting the chickens loose in the rooms. Undoubtedly this did keep down the vermin,
but it seemed probable, in view of all the circumstances, that the old lady regarded it rather
as feeding the chickens than as cleaning the rooms. The truth was that she had definitely given
up the idea of cleaning anything, under pressure of an attack of rheumatism, which had kept
her doubled up in one corner of her room for over a week; during which time eleven of her boarders,
heavily in her debt, had concluded to try their chances of employment in Kansas City. This
was July, and the fields were green. One never saw the fields, nor any green thing whatever,
in Packingtown; but one could go out on the road and "hobo it," as the men phrased it, and
see the country, and have a long rest, and an easy time riding on the freight cars.

Such was the home to which the new arrivals were welcomed. There was nothing better to be had--they
might not do so well by looking further, for Mrs. Jukniene had at least kept one room for herself
and her three little children, and now offered to share this with the women and the girls of
the party. They could get bedding at a secondhand store, she explained; and they would not
need any, while the weather was so hot--doubtless they would all sleep on the sidewalk such
nights as this, as did nearly all of her guests. "Tomorrow," Jurgis said, when they were left
alone, "tomorrow I will get a job, and perhaps Jonas will get one also; and then we can get
a place of our own."

Later that afternoon he and Ona went out to take a walk and look about them, to see more of
this district which was to be their home. In back of the yards the dreary two-story frame houses
were scattered farther apart, and there were great spaces bare--that seemingly had been overlooked
by the great sore of a city as it spread itself over the surface of the prairie. These bare
places were grown up with dingy, yellow weeds, hiding innumerable tomato cans; innumerable
children played upon them, chasing one another here and there, screaming and fighting. The
most uncanny thing about this neighborhood was the number of the children; you thought there
must be a school just out, and it was only after long acquaintance that you were able to realize
that there was no school, but that these were the children of the neighborhood--that there
were so many children to the block in Packingtown that nowhere on its streets could a horse
and buggy move faster than a walk!

It could not move faster anyhow, on account of the state of the streets. Those through which
Jurgis and Ona were walking resembled streets less than they did a miniature topographical
map. The roadway was commonly several feet lower than the level of the houses, which were sometimes
joined by high board walks; there were no pavements--there were mountains and valleys and rivers,
gullies and ditches, and great hollows full of stinking green water. In these pools the children
played, and rolled about in the mud of the streets; here and there one noticed them digging
in it, after trophies which they had stumbled on. One wondered about this, as also about the
swarms of flies which hung about the scene, literally blackening the air, and the strange,
fetid odor which assailed one's nostrils, a ghastly odor, of all the dead things of the universe.
It impelled the visitor to questions and then the residents would explain, quietly, that all
this was "made" land, and that it had been "made" by using it as a dumping ground for the city
garbage. After a few years the unpleasant effect of this would pass away, it was said; but
meantime, in hot weather--and especially when it rained--the flies were apt to be annoying.
Was it not unhealthful? the stranger would ask, and the residents would answer, "Perhaps; but
there is no telling."

A little way farther on, and Jurgis and Ona, staring open-eyed and wondering, came to the place
where this "made" ground was in process of making. Here was a great hole, perhaps two city
blocks square, and with long files of garbage wagons creeping into it. The place had an odor
for which there are no polite words; and it was sprinkled over with children, who raked in
it from dawn till dark. Sometimes visitors from the packing houses would wander out to see
this "dump," and they would stand by and debate as to whether the children were eating the
food they got, or merely collecting it for the chickens at home. Apparently none of them ever
went down to find out.

Beyond this dump there stood a great brickyard, with smoking chimneys. First they took out
the soil to make bricks, and then they filled it up again with garbage, which seemed to Jurgis
and Ona a felicitous arrangement, characteristic of an enterprising country like America. A
little way beyond was another great hole, which they had emptied and not yet filled up. This
held water, and all summer it stood there, with the near-by soil draining into it, festering
and stewing in the sun; and then, when winter came, somebody cut the ice on it, and sold it
to the people of the city. This, too, seemed to the newcomers an economical arrangement; for
they did not read the newspapers, and their heads were not full of troublesome thoughts about
"germs."

They stood there while the sun went down upon this scene, and the sky in the west turned blood-red,
and the tops of the houses shone like fire. Jurgis and Ona were not thinking of the sunset,
however--their backs were turned to it, and all their thoughts were of Packingtown, which they
could see so plainly in the distance. The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against
the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming
away to the end of the world. It was a study in colors now, this smoke; in the sunset light
it was black and brown and gray and purple. All the sordid suggestions of the place were gone--in
the twilight it was a vision of power. To the two who stood watching while the darkness swallowed
it up, it seemed a dream of wonder, with its talc of human energy, of things being done, of
employment for thousands upon thousands of men, of opportunity and freedom, of life and love
and joy. When they came away, arm in arm, Jurgis was saying, "Tomorrow I shall go there and
get a job!"

Chapter 3

In his capacity as delicatessen vender, Jokubas Szedvilas had many acquaintances. Among these
was one of the special policemen employed by Durham, whose duty it frequently was to pick out
men for employment. Jokubas had never tried it, but he expressed a certainty that he could
get some of his friends a job through this man. It was agreed, after consultation, that he
should make the effort with old Antanas and with Jonas. Jurgis was confident of his ability
to get work for himself, unassisted by any one. As we have said before, he was not mistaken
in this. He had gone to Brown's and stood there not more than half an hour before one of the
bosses noticed his form towering above the rest, and signaled to him. The colloquy which followed
was brief and to the point:

"Speak English?"

"No; Lit-uanian." (Jurgis had studied this word carefully.)

"Job?"

"Je." (A nod.)

"Worked here before?"

"No 'stand."

(Signals and gesticulations on the part of the boss. Vigorous shakes of the head by Jurgis.)

"Shovel guts?"

"No 'stand." (More shakes of the head.)

"Zarnos. Pagaiksztis. Szluofa!" (Imitative motions.)

"Je."

"See door. Durys?" (Pointing.)

"Je."

"To-morrow, seven o'clock. Understand? Rytoj! Prieszpietys! Septyni!"

"Dekui, tamistai!" (Thank you, sir.) And that was all. Jurgis turned away, and then in a sudden
rush the full realization of his triumph swept over him, and he gave a yell and a jump, and
started off on a run. He had a job! He had a job! And he went all the way home as if upon wings,
and burst into the house like a cyclone, to the rage of the numerous lodgers who had just turned
in for their daily sleep.

Meantime Jokubas had been to see his friend the policeman, and received encouragement, so it
was a happy party. There being no more to be done that day, the shop was left under the care
of Lucija, and her husband sallied forth to show his friends the sights of Packingtown. Jokubas
did this with the air of a country gentleman escorting a party of visitors over his estate;
he was an old-time resident, and all these wonders had grown up under his eyes, and he had
a personal pride in them. The packers might own the land, but he claimed the landscape, and
there was no one to say nay to this.

They passed down the busy street that led to the yards. It was still early morning, and everything
was at its high tide of activity. A steady stream of employees was pouring through the gate--employees
of the higher sort, at this hour, clerks and stenographers and such. For the women there were
waiting big two-horse wagons, which set off at a gallop as fast as they were filled. In the
distance there was heard again the lowing of the cattle, a sound as of a far-off ocean calling.
They followed it, this time, as eager as children in sight of a circus menagerie--which, indeed,
the scene a good deal resembled. They crossed the railroad tracks, and then on each side of
the street were the pens full of cattle; they would have stopped to look, but Jokubas hurried
them on, to where there was a stairway and a raised gallery, from which everything could be
seen. Here they stood, staring, breathless with wonder.

There is over a square mile of space in the yards, and more than half of it is occupied by
cattle pens; north and south as far as the eye can reach there stretches a sea of pens. And
they were all filled--so many cattle no one had ever dreamed existed in the world. Red cattle,
black, white, and yellow cattle; old cattle and young cattle; great bellowing bulls and little
calves not an hour born; meek-eyed milch cows and fierce, long-horned Texas steers. The sound
of them here was as of all the barnyards of the universe; and as for counting them--it would
have taken all day simply to count the pens. Here and there ran long alleys, blocked at intervals
by gates; and Jokubas told them that the number of these gates was twenty-five thousand. Jokubas
had recently been reading a newspaper article which was full of statistics such as that, and
he was very proud as he repeated them and made his guests cry out with wonder. Jurgis too had
a little of this sense of pride. Had he not just gotten a job, and become a sharer in all this
activity, a cog in this marvelous machine? Here and there about the alleys galloped men upon
horseback, booted, and carrying long whips; they were very busy, calling to each other, and
to those who were driving the cattle. They were drovers and stock raisers, who had come from
far states, and brokers and commission merchants, and buyers for all the big packing houses.

Here and there they would stop to inspect a bunch of cattle, and there would be a parley, brief
and businesslike. The buyer would nod or drop his whip, and that would mean a bargain; and
he would note it in his little book, along with hundreds of others he had made that morning.
Then Jokubas pointed out the place where the cattle were driven to be weighed, upon a great
scale that would weigh a hundred thousand pounds at once and record it automatically. It was
near to the east entrance that they stood, and all along this east side of the yards ran the
railroad tracks, into which the cars were run, loaded with cattle. All night long this had
been going on, and now the pens were full; by tonight they would all be empty, and the same
thing would be done again.

"And what will become of all these creatures?" cried Teta Elzbieta.

"By tonight," Jokubas answered, "they will all be killed and cut up; and over there on the
other side of the packing houses are more railroad tracks, where the cars come to take them away."

There were two hundred and fifty miles of track within the yards, their guide went on to tell
them. They brought about ten thousand head of cattle every day, and as many hogs, and half
as many sheep--which meant some eight or ten million live creatures turned into food every
year. One stood and watched, and little by little caught the drift of the tide, as it set in
the direction of the packing houses. There were groups of cattle being driven to the chutes,
which were roadways about fifteen feet wide, raised high above the pens. In these chutes the
stream of animals was continuous; it was quite uncanny to watch them, pressing on to their
fate, all unsuspicious a very river of death. Our friends were not poetical, and the sight
suggested to them no metaphors of human destiny; they thought only of the wonderful efficiency
of it all. The chutes into which the hogs went climbed high up--to the very top of the distant
buildings; and Jokubas explained that the hogs went up by the power of their own legs, and
then their weight carried them back through all the processes necessary to make them into pork.

"They don't waste anything here," said the guide, and then he laughed and added a witticism,
which he was pleased that his unsophisticated friends should take to be his own: "They use
everything about the hog except the squeal." In front of Brown's General Office building there
grows a tiny plot of grass, and this, you may learn, is the only bit of green thing in Packingtown;
likewise this jest about the hog and his squeal, the stock in trade of all the guides, is the
one gleam of humor that you will find there.

After they had seen enough of the pens, the party went up the street, to the mass of buildings
which occupy the center of the yards. These buildings, made of brick and stained with innumerable
layers of Packingtown smoke, were painted all over with advertising signs, from which the visitor
realized suddenly that he had come to the home of many of the torments of his life. It was
here that they made those products with the wonders of which they pestered him so--by placards
that defaced the landscape when he traveled, and by staring advertisements in the newspapers
and magazines--by silly little jingles that he could not get out of his mind, and gaudy pictures
that lurked for him around every street corner. Here was where they made Brown's Imperial Hams
and Bacon, Brown's Dressed Beef, Brown's Excelsior Sausages! Here was the headquarters of Durham's
Pure Leaf Lard, of Durham's Breakfast Bacon, Durham's Canned Beef, Potted Ham, Deviled Chicken,
Peerless Fertilizer!

Entering one of the Durham buildings, they found a number of other visitors waiting; and before
long there came a guide, to escort them through the place. They make a great feature of showing
strangers through the packing plants, for it is a good advertisement. But Ponas Jokubas whispered
maliciously that the visitors did not see any more than the packers wanted them to. They climbed
a long series of stairways outside of the building, to the top of its five or six stories.
Here was the chute, with its river of hogs, all patiently toiling upward; there was a place
for them to rest to cool off, and then through another passageway they went into a room from
which there is no returning for hogs.

It was a long, narrow room, with a gallery along it for visitors. At the head there was a great
iron wheel, about twenty feet in circumference, with rings here and there along its edge. Upon
both sides of this wheel there was a narrow space, into which came the hogs at the end of their
journey; in the midst of them stood a great burly Negro, bare-armed and bare-chested. He was
resting for the moment, for the wheel had stopped while men were cleaning up. In a minute or
two, however, it began slowly to revolve, and then the men upon each side of it sprang to work.
They had chains which they fastened about the leg of the nearest hog, and the other end of
the chain they hooked into one of the rings upon the wheel. So, as the wheel turned, a hog
was suddenly jerked off his feet and borne aloft.

At the same instant the car was assailed by a most terrifying shriek; the visitors started
in alarm, the women turned pale and shrank back. The shriek was followed by another, louder
and yet more agonizing--for once started upon that journey, the hog never came back; at the
top of the wheel he was shunted off upon a trolley, and went sailing down the room. And meantime
another was swung up, and then another, and another, until there was a double line of them,
each dangling by a foot and kicking in frenzy--and squealing. The uproar was appalling, perilous
to the eardrums; one feared there was too much sound for the room to hold--that the walls must
give way or the ceiling crack. There were high squeals and low squeals, grunts, and wails of
agony; there would come a momentary lull, and then a fresh outburst, louder than ever, surging
up to a deafening climax. It was too much for some of the visitors--the men would look at each
other, laughing nervously, and the women would stand with hands clenched, and the blood rushing
to their faces, and the tears starting in their eyes.

Meantime, heedless of all these things, the men upon the floor were going about their work.
Neither squeals of hogs nor tears of visitors made any difference to them; one by one they
hooked up the hogs, and one by one with a swift stroke they slit their throats. There was a
long line of hogs, with squeals and lifeblood ebbing away together; until at last each started
again, and vanished with a splash into a huge vat of boiling water.

It was all so very businesslike that one watched it fascinated. It was porkmaking by machinery,
porkmaking by applied mathematics. And yet somehow the most matter-of-fact person could not
help thinking of the hogs; they were so innocent, they came so very trustingly; and they were
so very human in their protests--and so perfectly within their rights! They had done nothing
to deserve it; and it was adding insult to injury, as the thing was done here, swinging them
up in this cold-blooded, impersonal way, without a pretense of apology, without the homage
of a tear. Now and then a visitor wept, to be sure; but this slaughtering machine ran on, visitors
or no visitors. It was like some horrible crime committed in a dungeon, all unseen and unheeded,
buried out of sight and of memory.

One could not stand and watch very long without becoming philosophical, without beginning to
deal in symbols and similes, and to hear the hog squeal of the universe. Was it permitted to
believe that there was nowhere upon the earth, or above the earth, a heaven for hogs, where
they were requited for all this suffering? Each one of these hogs was a separate creature.
Some were white hogs, some were black; some were brown, some were spotted; some were old, some
young; some were long and lean, some were monstrous. And each of them had an individuality
of his own, a will of his own, a hope and a heart's desire; each was full of self-confidence,
of self-importance, and a sense of dignity. And trusting and strong in faith he had gone about
his business, the while a black shadow hung over him and a horrid Fate waited in his pathway.
Now suddenly it had swooped upon him, and had seized him by the leg. Relentless, remorseless,
it was; all his protests, his screams, were nothing to it--it did its cruel will with him,
as if his wishes, his feelings, had simply no existence at all; it cut his throat and watched
him gasp out his life. And now was one to believe that there was nowhere a god of hogs, to
whom this hog personality was precious, to whom these hog squeals and agonies had a meaning?
Who would take this hog into his arms and comfort him, reward him for his work well done, and
show him the meaning of his sacrifice? Perhaps some glimpse of all this was in the thoughts
of our humble-minded Jurgis, as he turned to go on with the rest of the party, and muttered:
"Dieve--but I'm glad I'm not a hog!"

The carcass hog was scooped out of the vat by machinery, and then it fell to the second floor,
passing on the way through a wonderful machine with numerous scrapers, which adjusted themselves
to the size and shape of the animal, and sent it out at the other end with nearly all of its
bristles removed. It was then again strung up by machinery, and sent upon another trolley ride;
this time passing between two lines of men, who sat upon a raised platform, each doing a certain
single thing to the carcass as it came to him. One scraped the outside of a leg; another scraped
the inside of the same leg. One with a swift stroke cut the throat; another with two swift
strokes severed the head, which fell to the floor and vanished through a hole. Another made
a slit down the body; a second opened the body wider; a third with a saw cut the breastbone;
a fourth loosened the entrails; a fifth pulled them out--and they also slid through a hole
in the floor. There were men to scrape each side and men to scrape the back; there were men
to clean the carcass inside, to trim it and wash it. Looking down this room, one saw, creeping
slowly, a line of dangling hogs a hundred yards in length; and for every yard there was a man,
working as if a demon were after him. At the end of this hog's progress every inch of the carcass
had been gone over several times; and then it was rolled into the chilling room, where it stayed
for twenty-four hours, and where a stranger might lose himself in a forest of freezing hogs.

Before the carcass was admitted here, however, it had to pass a government inspector, who sat
in the doorway and felt of the glands in the neck for tuberculosis. This government inspector
did not have the manner of a man who was worked to death; he was apparently not haunted by
a fear that the hog might get by him before he had finished his testing. If you were a sociable
person, he was quite willing to enter into conversation with you, and to explain to you the
deadly nature of the ptomaines which are found in tubercular pork; and while he was talking
with you you could hardly be so ungrateful as to notice that a dozen carcasses were passing
him untouched. This inspector wore a blue uniform, with brass buttons, and he gave an atmosphere
of authority to the scene, and, as it were, put the stamp of official approval upon the things
which were done in Durham's.

Jurgis went down the line with the rest of the visitors, staring openmouthed, lost in wonder.
He had dressed hogs himself in the forest of Lithuania; but he had never expected to live to
see one hog dressed by several hundred men. It was like a wonderful poem to him, and he took
it all in guilelessly--even to the conspicuous signs demanding immaculate cleanliness of the
employees. Jurgis was vexed when the cynical Jokubas translated these signs with sarcastic
comments, offering to take them to the secret rooms where the spoiled meats went to be doctored.

The party descended to the next floor, where the various waste materials were treated. Here
came the entrails, to be scraped and washed clean for sausage casings; men and women worked
here in the midst of a sickening stench, which caused the visitors to hasten by, gasping. To
another room came all the scraps to be "tanked," which meant boiling and pumping off the grease
to make soap and lard; below they took out the refuse, and this, too, was a region in which
the visitors did not linger. In still other places men were engaged in cutting up the carcasses
that had been through the chilling rooms. First there were the "splitters," the most expert
workmen in the plant, who earned as high as fifty cents an hour, and did not a thing all day
except chop hogs down the middle. Then there were "cleaver men," great giants with muscles
of iron; each had two men to attend him--to slide the half carcass in front of him on the table,
and hold it while he chopped it, and then turn each piece so that he might chop it once more.
His cleaver had a blade about two feet long, and he never made but one cut; he made it so neatly,
too, that his implement did not smite through and dull itself--there was just enough force
for a perfect cut, and no more. So through various yawning holes there slipped to the floor
below--to one room hams, to another forequarters, to another sides of pork. One might go down
to this floor and see the pickling rooms, where the hams were put into vats, and the great
smoke rooms, with their airtight iron doors. In other rooms they prepared salt pork--there
were whole cellars full of it, built up in great towers to the ceiling. In yet other rooms
they were putting up meats in boxes and barrels, and wrapping hams and bacon in oiled paper,
sealing and labeling and sewing them. From the doors of these rooms went men with loaded trucks,
to the platform where freight cars were waiting to be filled; and one went out there and realized
with a start that he had come at last to the ground floor of this enormous building.

Then the party went across the street to where they did the killing of beef--where every hour
they turned four or five hundred cattle into meat. Unlike the place they had left, all this
work was done on one floor; and instead of there being one line of carcasses which moved to
the workmen, there were fifteen or twenty lines, and the men moved from one to another of these.
This made a scene of intense activity, a picture of human power wonderful to watch. It was
all in one great room, like a circus amphitheater, with a gallery for visitors running over
the center.

Along one side of the room ran a narrow gallery, a few feet from the floor; into which gallery
the cattle were driven by men with goads which gave them electric shocks. Once crowded in here,
the creatures were prisoned, each in a separate pen, by gates that shut, leaving them no room
to turn around; and while they stood bellowing and plunging, over the top of the pen there
leaned one of the "knockers," armed with a sledge hammer, and watching for a chance to deal
a blow. The room echoed with the thuds in quick succession, and the stamping and kicking of
the steers. The instant the animal had fallen, the "knocker" passed on to another; while a
second man raised a lever, and the side of the pen was raised, and the animal, still kicking
and struggling, slid out to the "killing bed." Here a man put shackles about one leg, and pressed
another lever, and the body was jerked up into the air. There were fifteen or twenty such pens,
and it was a matter of only a couple of minutes to knock fifteen or twenty cattle and roll
them out. Then once more the gates were opened, and another lot rushed in; and so out of each
pen there rolled a steady stream of carcasses, which the men upon the killing beds had to get
out of the way.

The manner in which they did this was something to be seen and never forgotten. They worked
with furious intensity, literally upon the run--at a pace with which there is nothing to be
compared except a football game. It was all highly specialized labor, each man having his task
to do; generally this would consist of only two or three specific cuts, and he would pass down
the line of fifteen or twenty carcasses, making these cuts upon each. First there came the
"butcher," to bleed them; this meant one swift stroke, so swift that you could not see it--only
the flash of the knife; and before you could realize it, the man had darted on to the next
line, and a stream of bright red was pouring out upon the floor. This floor was half an inch
deep with blood, in spite of the best efforts of men who kept shoveling it through holes; it
must have made the floor slippery, but no one could have guessed this by watching the men at work.

The carcass hung for a few minutes to bleed; there was no time lost, however, for there were
several hanging in each line, and one was always ready. It was let down to the ground, and
there came the "headsman," whose task it was to sever the head, with two or three swift strokes.
Then came the "floorsman," to make the first cut in the skin; and then another to finish ripping
the skin down the center; and then half a dozen more in swift succession, to finish the skinning.
After they were through, the carcass was again swung up; and while a man with a stick examined
the skin, to make sure that it had not been cut, and another rolled it tip and tumbled it through
one of the inevitable holes in the floor, the beef proceeded on its journey. There were men
to cut it, and men to split it, and men to gut it and scrape it clean inside. There were some
with hose which threw jets of boiling water upon it, and others who removed the feet and added
the final touches. In the end, as with the hogs, the finished beef was run into the chilling
room, to hang its appointed time.

The visitors were taken there and shown them, all neatly hung in rows, labeled conspicuously
with the tags of the government inspectors--and some, which had been killed by a special process,
marked with the sign of the kosher rabbi, certifying that it was fit for sale to the orthodox.
And then the visitors were taken to the other parts of the building, to see what became of
each particle of the waste material that had vanished through the floor; and to the pickling
rooms, and the salting rooms, the canning rooms, and the packing rooms, where choice meat was
prepared for shipping in refrigerator cars, destined to be eaten in all the four corners of
civilization. Afterward they went outside, wandering about among the mazes of buildings in
which was done the work auxiliary to this great industry. There was scarcely a thing needed
in the business that Durham and Company did not make for themselves. There was a great steam
power plant and an electricity plant. There was a barrel factory, and a boiler-repair shop.
There was a building to which the grease was piped, and made into soap and lard; and then there
was a factory for making lard cans, and another for making soap boxes. There was a building
in which the bristles were cleaned and dried, for the making of hair cushions and such things;
there was a building where the skins were dried and tanned, there was another where heads and
feet were made into glue, and another where bones were made into fertilizer. No tiniest particle
of organic matter was wasted in Durham's. Out of the horns of the cattle they made combs, buttons,
hairpins, and imitation ivory; out of the shinbones and other big bones they cut knife and
toothbrush handles, and mouthpieces for pipes; out of the hoofs they cut hairpins and buttons,
before they made the rest into glue. From such things as feet, knuckles, hide clippings, and
sinews came such strange and unlikely products as gelatin, isinglass, and phosphorus, bone
black, shoe blacking, and bone oil. They had curled-hair works for the cattle tails, and a
"wool pullery" for the sheepskins; they made pepsin from the stomachs of the pigs, and albumen
from the blood, and violin strings from the ill-smelling entrails. When there was nothing else
to be done with a thing, they first put it into a tank and got out of it all the tallow and
grease, and then they made it into fertilizer. All these industries were gathered into buildings
near by, connected by galleries and railroads with the main establishment; and it was estimated
that they had handled nearly a quarter of a billion of animals since the founding of the plant
by the elder Durham a generation and more ago. If you counted with it the other big plants--and
they were now really all one--it was, so Jokubas informed them, the greatest aggregation of
labor and capital ever gathered in one place. It employed thirty thousand men; it supported
directly two hundred and fifty thousand people in its neighborhood, and indirectly it supported
half a million. It sent its products to every country in the civilized world, and it furnished
the food for no less than thirty million people!

To all of these things our friends would listen openmouthed--it seemed to them impossible of
belief that anything so stupendous could have been devised by mortal man. That was why to Jurgis
it seemed almost profanity to speak about the place as did Jokubas, skeptically; it was a thing
as tremendous as the universe--the laws and ways of its working no more than the universe to
be questioned or understood. All that a mere man could do, it seemed to Jurgis, was to take
a thing like this as he found it, and do as he was told; to be given a place in it and a share
in its wonderful activities was a blessing to be grateful for, as one was grateful for the
sunshine and the rain. Jurgis was even glad that he had not seen the place before meeting with
his triumph, for he felt that the size of it would have overwhelmed him. But now he had been
admitted--he was a part of it all! He had the feeling that this whole huge establishment had
taken him under its protection, and had become responsible for his welfare. So guileless was
he, and ignorant of the nature of business, that he did not even realize that he had become
an employee of Brown's, and that Brown and Durham were supposed by all the world to be deadly
rivals--were even required to be deadly rivals by the law of the land, and ordered to try to
ruin each other under penalty of fine and imprisonment!

Chapter 4

Promptly at seven the next morning Jurgis reported for work. He came to the door that had been
pointed out to him, and there he waited for nearly two hours. The boss had meant for him to
enter, but had not said this, and so it was only when on his way out to hire another man that
he came upon Jurgis. He gave him a good cursing, but as Jurgis did not understand a word of
it he did not object. He followed the boss, who showed him where to put his street clothes,
and waited while he donned the working clothes he had bought in a secondhand shop and brought
with him in a bundle; then he led him to the "killing beds." The work which Jurgis was to do
here was very simple, and it took him but a few minutes to learn it. He was provided with a
stiff besom, such as is used by street sweepers, and it was his place to follow down the line
the man who drew out the smoking entrails from the carcass of the steer; this mass was to be
swept into a trap, which was then closed, so that no one might slip into it. As Jurgis came
in, the first cattle of the morning were just making their appearance; and so, with scarcely
time to look about him, and none to speak to any one, he fell to work. It was a sweltering
day in July, and the place ran with steaming hot blood--one waded in it on the floor. The stench
was almost overpowering, but to Jurgis it was nothing. His whole soul was dancing with joy--he
was at work at last! He was at work and earning money! All day long he was figuring to himself.
He was paid the fabulous sum of seventeen and a half cents an hour; and as it proved a rush
day and he worked until nearly seven o'clock in the evening, he went home to the family with
the tidings that he had earned more than a dollar and a half in a single day!

At home, also, there was more good news; so much of it at once that there was quite a celebration
in Aniele's hall bedroom. Jonas had been to have an interview with the special policeman to
whom Szedvilas had introduced him, and had been taken to see several of the bosses, with the
result that one had promised him a job the beginning of the next week. And then there was Marija
Berczynskas, who, fired with jealousy by the success of Jurgis, had set out upon her own responsibility
to get a place. Marija had nothing to take with her save her two brawny arms and the word "job,"
laboriously learned; but with these she had marched about Packingtown all day, entering every
door where there were signs of activity. Out of some she had been ordered with curses; but
Marija was not afraid of man or devil, and asked every one she saw--visitors and strangers,
or workpeople like herself, and once or twice even high and lofty office personages, who stared
at her as if they thought she was crazy. In the end, however, she had reaped her reward. In
one of the smaller plants she had stumbled upon a room where scores of women and girls were
sitting at long tables preparing smoked beef in cans; and wandering through room after room,
Marija came at last to the place where the sealed cans were being painted and labeled, and
here she had the good fortune to encounter the "forelady." Marija did not understand then,
as she was destined to understand later, what there was attractive to a "forelady" about the
combination of a face full of boundless good nature and the muscles of a dray horse; but the
woman had told her to come the next day and she would perhaps give her a chance to learn the
trade of painting cans. The painting of cans being skilled piecework, and paying as much as
two dollars a day, Marija burst in upon the family with the yell of a Comanche Indian, and
fell to capering about the room so as to frighten the baby almost into convulsions.

Better luck than all this could hardly have been hoped for; there was only one of them left
to seek a place. Jurgis was determined that Teta Elzbieta should stay at home to keep house,
and that Ona should help her. He would not have Ona working--he was not that sort of a man,
he said, and she was not that sort of a woman. It would be a strange thing if a man like him
could not support the family, with the help of the board of Jonas and Marija. He would not
even hear of letting the children go to work--there were schools here in America for children,
Jurgis had heard, to which they could go for nothing. That the priest would object to these
schools was something of which he had as yet no idea, and for the present his mind was made
up that the children of Teta Elzbieta should have as fair a chance as any other children. The
oldest of them, little Stanislovas, was but thirteen, and small for his age at that; and while
the oldest son of Szedvilas was only twelve, and had worked for over a year at Jones's, Jurgis
would have it that Stanislovas should learn to speak English, and grow up to be a skilled man.

So there was only old Dede Antanas; Jurgis would have had him rest too, but he was forced to
acknowledge that this was not possible, and, besides, the old man would not hear it spoken
of--it was his whim to insist that he was as lively as any boy. He had come to America as full
of hope as the best of them; and now he was the chief problem that worried his son. For every
one that Jurgis spoke to assured him that it was a waste of time to seek employment for the
old man in Packingtown. Szedvilas told him that the packers did not even keep the men who had
grown old in their own service--to say nothing of taking on new ones. And not only was it the
rule here, it was the rule everywhere in America, so far as he knew. To satisfy Jurgis he had
asked the policeman, and brought back the message that the thing was not to be thought of.
They had not told this to old Anthony, who had consequently spent the two days wandering about
from one part of the yards to another, and had now come home to hear about the triumph of the
others, smiling bravely and saying that it would be his turn another day.

Their good luck, they felt, had given them the right to think about a home; and sitting out
on the doorstep that summer evening, they held consultation about it, and Jurgis took occasion
to broach a weighty subject. Passing down the avenue to work that morning he had seen two boys
leaving an advertisement from house to house; and seeing that there were pictures upon it,
Jurgis had asked for one, and had rolled it up and tucked it into his shirt. At noontime a
man with whom he had been talking had read it to him and told him a little about it, with the
result that Jurgis had conceived a wild idea.

He brought out the placard, which was quite a work of art. It was nearly two feet long, printed
on calendered paper, with a selection of colors so bright that they shone even in the moonlight.
The center of the placard was occupied by a house, brilliantly painted, new, and dazzling.
The roof of it was of a purple hue, and trimmed with gold; the house itself was silvery, and
the doors and windows red. It was a two-story building, with a porch in front, and a very fancy
scrollwork around the edges; it was complete in every tiniest detail, even the doorknob, and
there was a hammock on the porch and white lace curtains in the windows. Underneath this, in
one corner, was a picture of a husband and wife in loving embrace; in the opposite corner was
a cradle, with fluffy curtains drawn over it, and a smiling cherub hovering upon silver-colored
wings. For fear that the significance of all this should be lost, there was a label, in Polish,
Lithuanian, and German--"Dom. Namai. Heim." "Why pay rent?" the linguistic circular went on
to demand. "Why not own your own home? Do you know that you can buy one for less than your
rent? We have built thousands of homes which are now occupied by happy families."--So it became
eloquent, picturing the blissfulness of married life in a house with nothing to pay. It even
quoted "Home, Sweet Home," and made bold to translate it into Polish--though for some reason
it omitted the Lithuanian of this. Perhaps the translator found it a difficult matter to be
sentimental in a language in which a sob is known as a gukcziojimas and a smile as a nusiszypsojimas.

Over this document the family pored long, while Ona spelled out its contents. It appeared that
this house contained four rooms, besides a basement, and that it might be bought for fifteen
hundred dollars, the lot and all. Of this, only three hundred dollars had to be paid down,
the balance being paid at the rate of twelve dollars a month. These were frightful sums, but
then they were in America, where people talked about such without fear. They had learned that
they would have to pay a rent of nine dollars a month for a flat, and there was no way of doing
better, unless the family of twelve was to exist in one or two rooms, as at present. If they
paid rent, of course, they might pay forever, and be no better off; whereas, if they could
only meet the extra expense in the beginning, there would at last come a time when they would
not have any rent to pay for the rest of their lives.

They figured it up. There was a little left of the money belonging to Teta Elzbieta, and there
was a little left to Jurgis. Marija had about fifty dollars pinned up somewhere in her stockings,
and Grandfather Anthony had part of the money he had gotten for his farm. If they all combined,
they would have enough to make the first payment; and if they had employment, so that they
could be sure of the future, it might really prove the best plan. It was, of course, not a
thing even to be talked of lightly; it was a thing they would have to sift to the bottom. And
yet, on the other hand, if they were going to make the venture, the sooner they did it the
better, for were they not paying rent all the time, and living in a most horrible way besides?
Jurgis was used to dirt--there was nothing could scare a man who had been with a railroad gang,
where one could gather up the fleas off the floor of the sleeping room by the handful. But
that sort of thing would not do for Ona. They must have a better place of some sort soon--Jurgis
said it with all the assurance of a man who had just made a dollar and fifty-seven cents in
a single day. Jurgis was at a loss to understand why, with wages as they were, so many of the
people of this district should live the way they did.

The next day Marija went to see her "forelady," and was told to report the first of the week,
and learn the business of can-painter. Marija went home, singing out loud all the way, and
was just in time to join Ona and her stepmother as they were setting out to go and make inquiry
concerning the house. That evening the three made their report to the men--the thing was altogether
as represented in the circular, or at any rate so the agent had said. The houses lay to the
south, about a mile and a half from the yards; they were wonderful bargains, the gentleman
had assured them--personally, and for their own good. He could do this, so he explained to
them, for the reason that he had himself no interest in their sale--he was merely the agent
for a company that had built them. These were the last, and the company was going out of business,
so if any one wished to take advantage of this wonderful no-rent plan, he would have to be
very quick. As a matter of fact there was just a little uncertainty as to whether there was
a single house left; for the agent had taken so many people to see them, and for all he knew
the company might have parted with the last. Seeing Teta Elzbieta's evident grief at this news,
he added, after some hesitation, that if they really intended to make a purchase, he would
send a telephone message at his own expense, and have one of the houses kept. So it had finally
been arranged--and they were to go and make an inspection the following Sunday morning.

That was Thursday; and all the rest of the week the killing gang at Brown's worked at full
pressure, and Jurgis cleared a dollar seventy-five every day. That was at the rate of ten and
one-half dollars a week, or forty-five a month. Jurgis was not able to figure, except it was
a very simple sum, but Ona was like lightning at such things, and she worked out the problem
for the family. Marija and Jonas were each to pay sixteen dollars a month board, and the old
man insisted that he could do the same as soon as he got a place--which might be any day now.
That would make ninety-three dollars. Then Marija and Jonas were between them to take a third
share in the house, which would leave only eight dollars a month for Jurgis to contribute to
the payment. So they would have eighty-five dollars a month--or, supposing that Dede Antanas
did not get work at once, seventy dollars a month--which ought surely to be sufficient for
the support of a family of twelve.

An hour before the time on Sunday morning the entire party set out. They had the address written
on a piece of paper, which they showed to some one now and then. It proved to be a long mile
and a half, but they walked it, and half an hour or so later the agent put in an appearance.
He was a smooth and florid personage, elegantly dressed, and he spoke their language freely,
which gave him a great advantage in dealing with them. He escorted them to the house, which
was one of a long row of the typical frame dwellings of the neighborhood, where architecture
is a luxury that is dispensed with. Ona's heart sank, for the house was not as it was shown
in the picture; the color scheme was different, for one thing, and then it did not seem quite
so big. Still, it was freshly painted, and made a considerable show. It was all brand-new,
so the agent told them, but he talked so incessantly that they were quite confused, and did
not have time to ask many questions. There were all sorts of things they had made up their
minds to inquire about, but when the time came, they either forgot them or lacked the courage.
The other houses in the row did not seem to be new, and few of them seemed to be occupied.
When they ventured to hint at this, the agent's reply was that the purchasers would be moving
in shortly. To press the matter would have seemed to be doubting his word, and never in their
lives had any one of them ever spoken to a person of the class called "gentleman" except with
deference and humility.

The house had a basement, about two feet below the street line, and a single story, about six
feet above it, reached by a flight of steps. In addition there was an attic, made by the peak
of the roof, and having one small window in each end. The street in front of the house was
unpaved and unlighted, and the view from it consisted of a few exactly similar houses, scattered
here and there upon lots grown up with dingy brown weeds. The house inside contained four rooms,
plastered white; the basement was but a frame, the walls being unplastered and the floor not
laid. The agent explained that the houses were built that way, as the purchasers generally
preferred to finish the basements to suit their own taste. The attic was also unfinished--the
family had been figuring that in case of an emergency they could rent this attic, but they
found that there was not even a floor, nothing but joists, and beneath them the lath and plaster
of the ceiling below. All of this, however, did not chill their ardor as much as might have
been expected, because of the volubility of the agent. There was no end to the advantages of
the house, as he set them forth, and he was not silent for an instant; he showed them everything,
down to the locks on the doors and the catches on the windows, and how to work them. He showed
them the sink in the kitchen, with running water and a faucet, something which Teta Elzbieta
had never in her wildest dreams hoped to possess. After a discovery such as that it would have
seemed ungrateful to find any fault, and so they tried to shut their eyes to other defects.

Still, they were peasant people, and they hung on to their money by instinct; it was quite
in vain that the agent hinted at promptness--they would see, they would see, they told him,
they could not decide until they had had more time. And so they went home again, and all day
and evening there was figuring and debating. It was an agony to them to have to make up their
minds in a matter such as this. They never could agree all together; there were so many arguments
upon each side, and one would be obstinate, and no sooner would the rest have convinced him
than it would transpire that his arguments had caused another to waver. Once, in the evening,
when they were all in harmony, and the house was as good as bought, Szedvilas came in and upset
them again. Szedvilas had no use for property owning. He told them cruel stories of people
who had been done to death in this "buying a home" swindle. They would be almost sure to get
into a tight place and lose all their money; and there was no end of expense that one could
never foresee; and the house might be good-for-nothing from top to bottom--how was a poor man
to know? Then, too, they would swindle you with the contract--and how was a poor man to understand
anything about a contract? It was all nothing but robbery, and there was no safety but in keeping
out of it. And pay rent? asked Jurgis. Ah, yes, to be sure, the other answered, that too was
robbery. It was all robbery, for a poor man. After half an hour of such depressing conversation,
they had their minds quite made up that they had been saved at the brink of a precipice; but
then Szedvilas went away, and Jonas, who was a sharp little man, reminded them that the delicatessen
business was a failure, according to its proprietor, and that this might account for his pessimistic
views. Which, of course, reopened the subject!

The controlling factor was that they could not stay where they were--they had to go somewhere.
And when they gave up the house plan and decided to rent, the prospect of paying out nine dollars
a month forever they found just as hard to face. All day and all night for nearly a whole week
they wrestled with the problem, and then in the end Jurgis took the responsibility. Brother
Jonas had gotten his job, and was pushing a truck in Durham's; and the killing gang at Brown's
continued to work early and late, so that Jurgis grew more confident every hour, more certain
of his mastership. It was the kind of thing the man of the family had to decide and carry through,
he told himself. Others might have failed at it, but he was not the failing kind--he would
show them how to do it. He would work all day, and all night, too, if need be; he would never
rest until the house was paid for and his people had a home. So he told them, and so in the
end the decision was made.

They had talked about looking at more houses before they made the purchase; but then they did
not know where any more were, and they did not know any way of finding out. The one they had
seen held the sway in their thoughts; whenever they thought of themselves in a house, it was
this house that they thought of. And so they went and told the agent that they were ready to
make the agreement. They knew, as an abstract proposition, that in matters of business all
men are to be accounted liars; but they could not but have been influenced by all they had
heard from the eloquent agent, and were quite persuaded that the house was something they had
run a risk of losing by their delay. They drew a deep breath when he told them that they were
still in time.

They were to come on the morrow, and he would have the papers all drawn up. This matter of
papers was one in which Jurgis understood to the full the need of caution; yet he could not
go himself--every one told him that he could not get a holiday, and that he might lose his
job by asking. So there was nothing to be done but to trust it to the women, with Szedvilas,
who promised to go with them. Jurgis spent a whole evening impressing upon them the seriousness
of the occasion--and then finally, out of innumerable hiding places about their persons and
in their baggage, came forth the precious wads of money, to be done up tightly in a little
bag and sewed fast in the lining of Teta Elzbieta's dress.

Early in the morning they sallied forth. Jurgis had given them so many instructions and warned
them against so many perils, that the women were quite pale with fright, and even the imperturbable
delicatessen vender, who prided himself upon being a businessman, was ill at ease. The agent
had the deed all ready, and invited them to sit down and read it; this Szedvilas proceeded
to do--a painful and laborious process, during which the agent drummed upon the desk. Teta
Elzbieta was so embarrassed that the perspiration came out upon her forehead in beads; for
was not this reading as much as to say plainly to the gentleman's face that they doubted his
honesty? Yet Jokubas Szedvilas read on and on; and presently there developed that he had good
reason for doing so. For a horrible suspicion had begun dawning in his mind; he knitted his
brows more and more as he read. This was not a deed of sale at all, so far as he could see--it
provided only for the renting of the property! It was hard to tell, with all this strange legal
jargon, words he had never heard before; but was not this plain--"the party of the first part
hereby covenants and agrees to rent to the said party of the second part!" And then again--"a
monthly rental of twelve dollars, for a period of eight years and four months!" Then Szedvilas
took off his spectacles, and looked at the agent, and stammered a question.

The agent was most polite, and explained that that was the usual formula; that it was always
arranged that the property should be merely rented. He kept trying to show them something in
the next paragraph; but Szedvilas could not get by the word "rental"--and when he translated
it to Teta Elzbieta, she too was thrown into a fright. They would not own the home at all,
then, for nearly nine years! The agent, with infinite patience, began to explain again; but
no explanation would do now. Elzbieta had firmly fixed in her mind the last solemn warning
of Jurgis: "If there is anything wrong, do not give him the money, but go out and get a lawyer."
It was an agonizing moment, but she sat in the chair, her hands clenched like death, and made
a fearful effort, summoning all her powers, and gasped out her purpose.

Jokubas translated her words. She expected the agent to fly into a passion, but he was, to
her bewilderment, as ever imperturbable; he even offered to go and get a lawyer for her, but
she declined this. They went a long way, on purpose to find a man who would not be a confederate.
Then let any one imagine their dismay, when, after half an hour, they came in with a lawyer,
and heard him greet the agent by his first name! They felt that all was lost; they sat like
prisoners summoned to hear the reading of their death warrant. There was nothing more that
they could do--they were trapped! The lawyer read over the deed, and when he had read it he
informed Szedvilas that it was all perfectly regular, that the deed was a blank deed such as
was often used in these sales. And was the price as agreed? the old man asked--three hundred
dollars down, and the balance at twelve dollars a month, till the total of fifteen hundred
dollars had been paid? Yes, that was correct. And it was for the sale of such and such a house--the
house and lot and everything? Yes,--and the lawyer showed him where that was all written. And
it was all perfectly regular--there were no tricks about it of any sort? They were poor people,
and this was all they had in the world, and if there was anything wrong they would be ruined.
And so Szedvilas went on, asking one trembling question after another, while the eyes of the
women folks were fixed upon him in mute agony. They could not understand what he was saying,
but they knew that upon it their fate depended. And when at last he had questioned until there
was no more questioning to be done, and the time came for them to make up their minds, and
either close the bargain or reject it, it was all that poor Teta Elzbieta could do to keep
from bursting into tears. Jokubas had asked her if she wished to sign; he had asked her twice--and
what could she say? How did she know if this lawyer were telling the truth--that he was not
in the conspiracy? And yet, how could she say so--what excuse could she give? The eyes of every
one in the room were upon her, awaiting her decision; and at last, half blind with her tears,
she began fumbling in her jacket, where she had pinned the precious money. And she brought
it out and unwrapped it before the men. All of this Ona sat watching, from a corner of the
room, twisting her hands together, meantime, in a fever of fright. Ona longed to cry out and
tell her stepmother to stop, that it was all a trap; but there seemed to be something clutching
her by the throat, and she could not make a sound. And so Teta Elzbieta laid the money on the
table, and the agent picked it up and counted it, and then wrote them a receipt for it and
passed them the deed. Then he gave a sigh of satisfaction, and rose and shook hands with them
all, still as smooth and polite as at the beginning. Ona had a dim recollection of the lawyer
telling Szedvilas that his charge was a dollar, which occasioned some debate, and more agony;
and then, after they had paid that, too, they went out into the street, her stepmother clutching
the deed in her hand. They were so weak from fright that they could not walk, but had to sit
down on the way.

So they went home, with a deadly terror gnawing at their souls; and that evening Jurgis came
home and heard their story, and that was the end. Jurgis was sure that they had been swindled,
and were ruined; and he tore his hair and cursed like a madman, swearing that he would kill
the agent that very night. In the end he seized the paper and rushed out of the house, and
all the way across the yards to Halsted Street. He dragged Szedvilas out from his supper, and
together they rushed to consult another lawyer. When they entered his office the lawyer sprang
up, for Jurgis looked like a crazy person, with flying hair and bloodshot eyes. His companion
explained the situation, and the lawyer took the paper and began to read it, while Jurgis stood
clutching the desk with knotted hands, trembling in every nerve.

Once or twice the lawyer looked up and asked a question of Szedvilas; the other did not know
a word that he was saying, but his eyes were fixed upon the lawyer's face, striving in an agony
of dread to read his mind. He saw the lawyer look up and laugh, and he gave a gasp; the man
said something to Szedvilas, and Jurgis turned upon his friend, his heart almost stopping.

"Well?" he panted.

"He says it is all right," said Szedvilas.

"All right!"

"Yes, he says it is just as it should be." And Jurgis, in his relief, sank down into a chair.

"Are you sure of it?" he gasped, and made Szedvilas translate question after question. He could
not hear it often enough; he could not ask with enough variations. Yes, they had bought the
house, they had really bought it. It belonged to them, they had only to pay the money and it
would be all right. Then Jurgis covered his face with his hands, for there were tears in his
eyes, and he felt like a fool. But he had had such a horrible fright; strong man as he was,
it left him almost too weak to stand up.

The lawyer explained that the rental was a form--the property was said to be merely rented
until the last payment had been made, the purpose being to make it easier to turn the party
out if he did not make the payments. So long as they paid, however, they had nothing to fear,
the house was all theirs.

Jurgis was so grateful that he paid the half dollar the lawyer asked without winking an eyelash,
and then rushed home to tell the news to the family. He found Ona in a faint and the babies
screaming, and the whole house in an uproar--for it had been believed by all that he had gone
to murder the agent. It was hours before the excitement could be calmed; and all through that
cruel night Jurgis would wake up now and then and hear Ona and her stepmother in the next room,
sobbing softly to themselves.

Chapter 5

They had bought their home. It was hard for them to realize that the wonderful house was theirs
to move into whenever they chose. They spent all their time thinking about it, and what they
were going to put into it. As their week with Aniele was up in three days, they lost no time
in getting ready. They had to make some shift to furnish it, and every instant of their leisure
was given to discussing this.

A person who had such a task before him would not need to look very far in Packingtown--he
had only to walk up the avenue and read the signs, or get into a streetcar, to obtain full
information as to pretty much everything a human creature could need. It was quite touching,
the zeal of people to see that his health and happiness were provided for. Did the person wish
to smoke? There was a little discourse about cigars, showing him exactly why the Thomas Jefferson
Five-cent Perfecto was the only cigar worthy of the name. Had he, on the other hand, smoked
too much? Here was a remedy for the smoking habit, twenty-five doses for a quarter, and a cure
absolutely guaranteed in ten doses. In innumerable ways such as this, the traveler found that
somebody had been busied to make smooth his paths through the world, and to let him know what
had been done for him. In Packingtown the advertisements had a style all of their own, adapted
to the peculiar population. One would be tenderly solicitous. "Is your wife pale?" it would
inquire. "Is she discouraged, does she drag herself about the house and find fault with everything?
Why do you not tell her to try Dr. Lanahan's Life Preservers?" Another would be jocular in
tone, slapping you on the back, so to speak. "Don't be a chump!" it would exclaim. "Go and
get the Goliath Bunion Cure." "Get a move on you!" would chime in another. "It's easy, if you
wear the Eureka Two-fifty Shoe."

Among these importunate signs was one that had caught the attention of the family by its pictures.
It showed two very pretty little birds building themselves a home; and Marija had asked an
acquaintance to read it to her, and told them that it related to the furnishing of a house.
"Feather your nest," it ran--and went on to say that it could furnish all the necessary feathers
for a four-room nest for the ludicrously small sum of seventy-five dollars. The particularly
important thing about this offer was that only a small part of the money need be had at once--the
rest one might pay a few dollars every month. Our friends had to have some furniture, there
was no getting away from that; but their little fund of money had sunk so low that they could
hardly get to sleep at night, and so they fled to this as their deliverance. There was more
agony and another paper for Elzbieta to sign, and then one night when Jurgis came home, he
was told the breathless tidings that the furniture had arrived and was safely stowed in the
house: a parlor set of four pieces, a bedroom set of three pieces, a dining room table and
four chairs, a toilet set with beautiful pink roses painted all over it, an assortment of crockery,
also with pink roses--and so on. One of the plates in the set had been found broken when they
unpacked it, and Ona was going to the store the first thing in the morning to make them change
it; also they had promised three saucepans, and there had only two come, and did Jurgis think
that they were trying to cheat them?

The next day they went to the house; and when the men came from work they ate a few hurried
mouthfuls at Aniele's, and then set to work at the task of carrying their belongings to their
new home. The distance was in reality over two miles, but Jurgis made two trips that night,
each time with a huge pile of mattresses and bedding on his head, with bundles of clothing
and bags and things tied up inside. Anywhere else in Chicago he would have stood a good chance
of being arrested; but the policemen in Packingtown were apparently used to these informal
movings, and contented themselves with a cursory examination now and then. It was quite wonderful
to see how fine the house looked, with all the things in it, even by the dim light of a lamp:
it was really home, and almost as exciting as the placard had described it. Ona was fairly
dancing, and she and Cousin Marija took Jurgis by the arm and escorted him from room to room,
sitting in each chair by turns, and then insisting that he should do the same. One chair squeaked
with his great weight, and they screamed with fright, and woke the baby and brought everybody
running. Altogether it was a great day; and tired as they were, Jurgis and Ona sat up late,
contented simply to hold each other and gaze in rapture about the room. They were going to
be married as soon as they could get everything settled, and a little spare money put by; and
this was to be their home--that little room yonder would be theirs!

It was in truth a never-ending delight, the fixing up of this house. They had no money to spend
for the pleasure of spending, but there were a few absolutely necessary things, and the buying
of these was a perpetual adventure for Ona. It must always be done at night, so that Jurgis
could go along; and even if it were only a pepper cruet, or half a dozen glasses for ten cents,
that was enough for an expedition. On Saturday night they came home with a great basketful
of things, and spread them out on the table, while every one stood round, and the children
climbed up on the chairs, or howled to be lifted up to see. There were sugar and salt and tea
and crackers, and a can of lard and a milk pail, and a scrubbing brush, and a pair of shoes
for the second oldest boy, and a can of oil, and a tack hammer, and a pound of nails. These
last were to be driven into the walls of the kitchen and the bedrooms, to hang things on; and
there was a family discussion as to the place where each one was to be driven. Then Jurgis
would try to hammer, and hit his fingers because the hammer was too small, and get mad because
Ona had refused to let him pay fifteen cents more and get a bigger hammer; and Ona would be
invited to try it herself, and hurt her thumb, and cry out, which necessitated the thumb's
being kissed by Jurgis. Finally, after every one had had a try, the nails would be driven,
and something hung up. Jurgis had come home with a big packing box on his head, and he sent
Jonas to get another that he had bought. He meant to take one side out of these tomorrow, and
put shelves in them, and make them into bureaus and places to keep things for the bedrooms.
The nest which had been advertised had not included feathers for quite so many birds as there
were in this family.

They had, of course, put their dining table in the kitchen, and the dining room was used as
the bedroom of Teta Elzbieta and five of her children. She and the two youngest slept in the
only bed, and the other three had a mattress on the floor. Ona and her cousin dragged a mattress
into the parlor and slept at night, and the three men and the oldest boy slept in the other
room, having nothing but the very level floor to rest on for the present. Even so, however,
they slept soundly--it was necessary for Teta Elzbieta to pound more than once on the at a
quarter past five every morning. She would have ready a great pot full of steaming black coffee,
and oatmeal and bread and smoked sausages; and then she would fix them their dinner pails with
more thick slices of bread with lard between them--they could not afford butter--and some onions
and a piece of cheese, and so they would tramp away to work.

This was the first time in his life that he had ever really worked, it seemed to Jurgis; it
was the first time that he had ever had anything to do which took all he had in him. Jurgis
had stood with the rest up in the gallery and watched the men on the killing beds, marveling
at their speed and power as if they had been wonderful machines; it somehow never occurred
to one to think of the flesh-and-blood side of it--that is, not until he actually got down
into the pit and took off his coat. Then he saw things in a different light, he got at the
inside of them. The pace they set here, it was one that called for every faculty of a man--from
the instant the first steer fell till the sounding of the noon whistle, and again from half-past
twelve till heaven only knew what hour in the late afternoon or evening, there was never one
instant's rest for a man, for his hand or his eye or his brain. Jurgis saw how they managed
it; there were portions of the work which determined the pace of the rest, and for these they
had picked men whom they paid high wages, and whom they changed frequently. You might easily
pick out these pacemakers, for they worked under the eye of the bosses, and they worked like
men possessed. This was called "speeding up the gang," and if any man could not keep up with
the pace, there were hundreds outside begging to try.

Yet Jurgis did not mind it; he rather enjoyed it. It saved him the necessity of flinging his
arms about and fidgeting as he did in most work. He would laugh to himself as he ran down the
line, darting a glance now and then at the man ahead of him. It was not the pleasantest work
one could think of, but it was necessary work; and what more had a man the right to ask than
a chance to do something useful, and to get good pay for doing it?

So Jurgis thought, and so he spoke, in his bold, free way; very much to his surprise, he found
that it had a tendency to get him into trouble. For most of the men here took a fearfully different
view of the thing. He was quite dismayed when he first began to find it out--that most of the
men hated their work. It seemed strange, it was even terrible, when you came to find out the
universality of the sentiment; but it was certainly the fact--they hated their work. They hated
the bosses and they hated the owners; they hated the whole place, the whole neighborhood--even
the whole city, with an all-inclusive hatred, bitter and fierce. Women and little children
would fall to cursing about it; it was rotten, rotten as hell--everything was rotten. When
Jurgis would ask them what they meant, they would begin to get suspicious, and content themselves
with saying, "Never mind, you stay here and see for yourself."

One of the first problems that Jurgis ran upon was that of the unions. He had had no experience
with unions, and he had to have it explained to him that the men were banded together for the
purpose of fighting for their rights. Jurgis asked them what they meant by their rights, a
question in which he was quite sincere, for he had not any idea of any rights that he had,
except the right to hunt for a job, and do as he was told when he got it. Generally, however,
this harmless question would only make his fellow workingmen lose their tempers and call him
a fool. There was a delegate of the butcher-helpers' union who came to see Jurgis to enroll
him; and when Jurgis found that this meant that he would have to part with some of his money,
he froze up directly, and the delegate, who was an Irishman and only knew a few words of Lithuanian,
lost his temper and began to threaten him. In the end Jurgis got into a fine rage, and made
it sufficiently plain that it would take more than one Irishman to scare him into a union.
Little by little he gathered that the main thing the men wanted was to put a stop to the habit
of "speeding-up"; they were trying their best to force a lessening of the pace, for there were
some, they said, who could not keep up with it, whom it was killing. But Jurgis had no sympathy
with such ideas as this--he could do the work himself, and so could the rest of them, he declared,
if they were good for anything. If they couldn't do it, let them go somewhere else. Jurgis
had not studied the books, and he would not have known how to pronounce "laissez faire"; but
he had been round the world enough to know that a man has to shift for himself in it, and that
if he gets the worst of it, there is nobody to listen to him holler.

Yet there have been known to be philosophers and plain men who swore by Malthus in the books,
and would, nevertheless, subscribe to a relief fund in time of a famine. It was the same with
Jurgis, who consigned the unfit to destruction, while going about all day sick at heart because
of his poor old father, who was wandering somewhere in the yards begging for a chance to earn
his bread. Old Antanas had been a worker ever since he was a child; he had run away from home
when he was twelve, because his father beat him for trying to learn to read. And he was a faithful
man, too; he was a man you might leave alone for a month, if only you had made him understand
what you wanted him to do in the meantime. And now here he was, worn out in soul and body,
and with no more place in the world than a sick dog. He had his home, as it happened, and some
one who would care for him it he never got a job; but his son could not help thinking, suppose
this had not been the case. Antanas Rudkus had been into every building in Packingtown by this
time, and into nearly every room; he had stood mornings among the crowd of applicants till
the very policemen had come to know his face and to tell him to go home and give it up. He
had been likewise to all the stores and saloons for a mile about, begging for some little thing
to do; and everywhere they had ordered him out, sometimes with curses, and not once even stopping
to ask him a question.

So, after all, there was a crack in the fine structure of Jurgis' faith in things as they are.
The crack was wide while Dede Antanas was hunting a job--and it was yet wider when he finally
got it. For one evening the old man came home in a great state of excitement, with the tale
that he had been approached by a man in one of the corridors of the pickle rooms of Durham's,
and asked what he would pay to get a job. He had not known what to make of this at first; but
the man had gone on with matter-of-fact frankness to say that he could get him a job, provided
that he were willing to pay one-third of his wages for it. Was he a boss? Antanas had asked;
to which the man had replied that that was nobody's business, but that he could do what he said.

Jurgis had made some friends by this time, and he sought one of them and asked what this meant.
The friend, who was named Tamoszius Kuszleika, was a sharp little man who folded hides on the
killing beds, and he listened to what Jurgis had to say without seeming at all surprised. They
were common enough, he said, such cases of petty graft. It was simply some boss who proposed
to add a little to his income. After Jurgis had been there awhile he would know that the plants
were simply honeycombed with rottenness of that sort--the bosses grafted off the men, and they
grafted off each other; and some day the superintendent would find out about the boss, and
then he would graft off the boss. Warming to the subject, Tamoszius went on to explain the
situation. Here was Durham's, for instance, owned by a man who was trying to make as much money
out of it as he could, and did not care in the least how he did it; and underneath him, ranged
in ranks and grades like an army, were managers and superintendents and foremen, each one driving
the man next below him and trying to squeeze out of him as much work as possible. And all the
men of the same rank were pitted against each other; the accounts of each were kept separately,
and every man lived in terror of losing his job, if another made a better record than he. So
from top to bottom the place was simply a seething caldron of jealousies and hatreds; there
was no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there was no place in it where a man counted for
anything against a dollar. And worse than there being no decency, there was not even any honesty.
The reason for that? Who could say? It must have been old Durham in the beginning; it was a
heritage which the self-made merchant had left to his son, along with his millions.

Jurgis would find out these things for himself, if he stayed there long enough; it was the
men who had to do all the dirty jobs, and so there was no deceiving them; and they caught the
spirit of the place, and did like all the rest. Jurgis had come there, and thought he was going
to make himself useful, and rise and become a skilled man; but he would soon find out his error--for
nobody rose in Packingtown by doing good work. You could lay that down for a rule--if you met
a man who was rising in Packingtown, you met a knave. That man who had been sent to Jurgis'
father by the boss, he would rise; the man who told tales and spied upon his fellows would
rise; but the man who minded his own business and did his work--why, they would "speed him
up" till they had worn him out, and then they would throw him into the gutter.

Jurgis went home with his head buzzing. Yet he could not bring himself to believe such things--no,
it could not be so. Tamoszius was simply another of the grumblers. He was a man who spent all
his time fiddling; and he would go to parties at night and not get home till sunrise, and so
of course he did not feel like work. Then, too, he was a puny little chap; and so he had been
left behind in the race, and that was why he was sore. And yet so many strange things kept
coming to Jurgis' notice every day!

He tried to persuade his father to have nothing to do with the offer. But old Antanas had begged
until he was worn out, and all his courage was gone; he wanted a job, any sort of a job. So
the next day he went and found the man who had spoken to him, and promised to bring him a third
of all he earned; and that same day he was put to work in Durham's cellars. It was a "pickle
room," where there was never a dry spot to stand upon, and so he had to take nearly the whole
of his first week's earnings to buy him a pair of heavy-soled boots. He was a "squeedgie" man;
his job was to go about all day with a long-handled mop, swabbing up the floor. Except that
it was damp and dark, it was not an unpleasant job, in summer.

Now Antanas Rudkus was the meekest man that God ever put on earth; and so Jurgis found it a
striking confirmation of what the men all said, that his father had been at work only two days
before he came home as bitter as any of them, and cursing Durham's with all the power of his
soul. For they had set him to cleaning out the traps; and the family sat round and listened
in wonder while he told them what that meant. It seemed that he was working in the room where
the men prepared the beef for canning, and the beef had lain in vats full of chemicals, and
men with great forks speared it out and dumped it into trucks, to be taken to the cooking room.
When they had speared out all they could reach, they emptied the vat on the floor, and then
with shovels scraped up the balance and dumped it into the truck. This floor was filthy, yet
they set Antanas with his mop slopping the "pickle" into a hole that connected with a sink,
where it was caught and used over again forever; and if that were not enough, there was a trap
in the pipe, where all the scraps of meat and odds and ends of refuse were caught, and every
few days it was the old man's task to clean these out, and shovel their contents into one of
the trucks with the rest of the meat!

This was the experience of Antanas; and then there came also Jonas and Marija with tales to
tell. Marija was working for one of the independent packers, and was quite beside herself and
outrageous with triumph over the sums of money she was making as a painter of cans. But one
day she walked home with a pale-faced little woman who worked opposite to her, Jadvyga Marcinkus
by name, and Jadvyga told her how she, Marija, had chanced to get her job. She had taken the
place of an Irishwoman who had been working in that factory ever since any one could remember.
For over fifteen years, so she declared. Mary Dennis was her name, and a long time ago she
had been seduced, and had a little boy; he was a cripple, and an epileptic, but still he was
all that she had in the world to love, and they had lived in a little room alone somewhere
back of Halsted Street, where the Irish were. Mary had had consumption, and all day long you
might hear her coughing as she worked; of late she had been going all to pieces, and when Marija
came, the "forelady" had suddenly decided to turn her off. The forelady had to come up to a
certain standard herself, and could not stop for sick people, Jadvyga explained. The fact that
Mary had been there so long had not made any difference to her--it was doubtful if she even
knew that, for both the forelady and the superintendent were new people, having only been there
two or three years themselves. Jadvyga did not know what had become of the poor creature; she
would have gone to see her, but had been sick herself. She had pains in her back all the time,
Jadvyga explained, and feared that she had womb trouble. It was not fit work for a woman, handling
fourteen-pound cans all day.

It was a striking circumstance that Jonas, too, had gotten his job by the misfortune of some
other person. Jonas pushed a truck loaded with hams from the smoke rooms on to an elevator,
and thence to the packing rooms. The trucks were all of iron, and heavy, and they put about
threescore hams on each of them, a load of more than a quarter of a ton. On the uneven floor
it was a task for a man to start one of these trucks, unless he was a giant; and when it was
once started he naturally tried his best to keep it going. There was always the boss prowling
about, and if there was a second's delay he would fall to cursing; Lithuanians and Slovaks
and such, who could not understand what was said to them, the bosses were wont to kick about
the place like so many dogs. Therefore these trucks went for the most part on the run; and
the predecessor of Jonas had been jammed against the wall by one and crushed in a horrible
and nameless manner.

All of these were sinister incidents; but they were trifles compared to what Jurgis saw with
his own eyes before long. One curious thing he had noticed, the very first day, in his profession
of shoveler of guts; which was the sharp trick of the floor bosses whenever there chanced to
come a "slunk" calf. Any man who knows anything about butchering knows that the flesh of a
cow that is about to calve, or has just calved, is not fit for food. A good many of these came
every day to the packing houses--and, of course, if they had chosen, it would have been an
easy matter for the packers to keep them till they were fit for food. But for the saving of
time and fodder, it was the law that cows of that sort came along with the others, and whoever
noticed it would tell the boss, and the boss would start up a conversation with the government
inspector, and the two would stroll away. So in a trice the carcass of the cow would be cleaned
out, and entrails would have vanished; it was Jurgis' task to slide them into the trap, calves
and all, and on the floor below they took out these "slunk" calves, and butchered them for
meat, and used even the skins of them.

One day a man slipped and hurt his leg; and that afternoon, when the last of the cattle had
been disposed of, and the men were leaving, Jurgis was ordered to remain and do some special
work which this injured man had usually done. It was late, almost dark, and the government
inspectors had all gone, and there were only a dozen or two of men on the floor. That day they
had killed about four thousand cattle, and these cattle had come in freight trains from far
states, and some of them had got hurt. There were some with broken legs, and some with gored
sides; there were some that had died, from what cause no one could say; and they were all to
be disposed of, here in darkness and silence. "Downers," the men called them; and the packing
house had a special elevator upon which they were raised to the killing beds, where the gang
proceeded to handle them, with an air of businesslike nonchalance which said plainer than any
words that it was a matter of everyday routine. It took a couple of hours to get them out of
the way, and in the end Jurgis saw them go into the chilling rooms with the rest of the meat,
being carefully scattered here and there so that they could not be identified. When he came
home that night he was in a very somber mood, having begun to see at last how those might be
right who had laughed at him for his faith in America.

Chapter 6

Jurgis and Ona were very much in love; they had waited a long time--it was now well into the
second year, and Jurgis judged everything by the criterion of its helping or hindering their
union. All his thoughts were there; he accepted the family because it was a part of Ona. And
he was interested in the house because it was to be Ona's home. Even the tricks and cruelties
he saw at Durham's had little meaning for him just then, save as they might happen to affect
his future with Ona.

The marriage would have been at once, if they had had their way; but this would mean that they
would have to do without any wedding feast, and when they suggested this they came into conflict
with the old people. To Teta Elzbieta especially the very suggestion was an affliction. What!
she would cry. To be married on the roadside like a parcel of beggars! No! No!--Elzbieta had
some traditions behind her; she had been a person of importance in her girlhood--had lived
on a big estate and had servants, and might have married well and been a lady, but for the
fact that there had been nine daughters and no sons in the family. Even so, however, she knew
what was decent, and clung to her traditions with desperation. They were not going to lose
all caste, even if they had come to be unskilled laborers in Packingtown; and that Ona had
even talked of omitting a Yeselija was enough to keep her stepmother lying awake all night.
It was in vain for them to say that they had so few friends; they were bound to have friends
in time, and then the friends would talk about it. They must not give up what was right for
a little money--if they did, the money would never do them any good, they could depend upon
that. And Elzbieta would call upon Dede Antanas to support her; there was a fear in the souls
of these two, lest this journey to a new country might somehow undermine the old home virtues
of their children. The very first Sunday they had all been taken to mass; and poor as they
were, Elzbieta had felt it advisable to invest a little of her resources in a representation
of the babe of Bethlehem, made in plaster, and painted in brilliant colors. Though it was only
a foot high, there was a shrine with four snow-white steeples, and the Virgin standing with
her child in her arms, and the kings and shepherds and wise men bowing down before him. It
had cost fifty cents; but Elzbieta had a feeling that money spent for such things was not to
be counted too closely, it would come back in hidden ways. The piece was beautiful on the parlor
mantel, and one could not have a home without some sort of ornament.

The cost of the wedding feast would, of course, be returned to them; but the problem was to
raise it even temporarily. They had been in the neighborhood so short a time that they could
not get much credit, and there was no one except Szedvilas from whom they could borrow even
a little. Evening after evening Jurgis and Ona would sit and figure the expenses, calculating
the term of their separation. They could not possibly manage it decently for less than two
hundred dollars, and even though they were welcome to count in the whole of the earnings of
Marija and Jonas, as a loan, they could not hope to raise this sum in less than four or five
months. So Ona began thinking of seeking employment herself, saying that if she had even ordinarily
good luck, she might be able to take two months off the time. They were just beginning to adjust
themselves to this necessity, when out of the clear sky there fell a thunderbolt upon them--a
calamity that scattered all their hopes to the four winds.

About a block away from them there lived another Lithuanian family, consisting of an elderly
widow and one grown son; their name was Majauszkis, and our friends struck up an acquaintance
with them before long. One evening they came over for a visit, and naturally the first subject
upon which the conversation turned was the neighborhood and its history; and then Grandmother
Majauszkiene, as the old lady was called, proceeded to recite to them a string of horrors that
fairly froze their blood. She was a wrinkled-up and wizened personage--she must have been eighty--and
as she mumbled the grim story through her toothless gums, she seemed a very old witch to them.
Grandmother Majauszkiene had lived in the midst of misfortune so long that it had come to be
her element, and she talked about starvation, sickness, and death as other people might about
weddings and holidays.

The thing came gradually. In the first place as to the house they had bought, it was not new
at all, as they had supposed; it was about fifteen years old, and there was nothing new upon
it but the paint, which was so bad that it needed to be put on new every year or two. The house
was one of a whole row that was built by a company which existed to make money by swindling
poor people. The family had paid fifteen hundred dollars for it, and it had not cost the builders
five hundred, when it was new. Grandmother Majauszkiene knew that because her son belonged
to a political organization with a contractor who put up exactly such houses. They used the
very flimsiest and cheapest material; they built the houses a dozen at a time, and they cared
about nothing at all except the outside shine. The family could take her word as to the trouble
they would have, for she had been through it all--she and her son had bought their house in
exactly the same way. They had fooled the company, however, for her son was a skilled man,
who made as high as a hundred dollars a month, and as he had had sense enough not to marry,
they had been able to pay for the house.

Grandmother Majauszkiene saw that her friends were puzzled at this remark; they did not quite
see how paying for the house was "fooling the company." Evidently they were very inexperienced.
Cheap as the houses were, they were sold with the idea that the people who bought them would
not be able to pay for them. When they failed--if it were only by a single month--they would
lose the house and all that they had paid on it, and then the company would sell it over again.
And did they often get a chance to do that? Dieve! (Grandmother Majauszkiene raised her hands.)
They did it--how often no one could say, but certainly more than half of the time. They might
ask any one who knew anything at all about Packingtown as to that; she had been living here
ever since this house was built, and she could tell them all about it. And had it ever been
sold before? Susimilkie! Why, since it had been built, no less than four families that their
informant could name had tried to buy it and failed. She would tell them a little about it.

The first family had been Germans. The families had all been of different nationalities--there
had been a representative of several races that had displaced each other in the stockyards.
Grandmother Majauszkiene had come to America with her son at a time when so far as she knew
there was only one other Lithuanian family in the district; the workers had all been Germans
then--skilled cattle butchers that the packers had brought from abroad to start the business.
Afterward, as cheaper labor had come, these Germans had moved away. The next were the Irish--there
had been six or eight years when Packingtown had been a regular Irish city. There were a few
colonies of them still here, enough to run all the unions and the police force and get all
the graft; but most of those who were working in the packing houses had gone away at the next
drop in wages--after the big strike. The Bohemians had come then, and after them the Poles.
People said that old man Durham himself was responsible for these immigrations; he had sworn
that he would fix the people of Packingtown so that they would never again call a strike on
him, and so he had sent his agents into every city and village in Europe to spread the tale
of the chances of work and high wages at the stockyards. The people had come in hordes; and
old Durham had squeezed them tighter and tighter, speeding them up and grinding them to pieces
and sending for new ones. The Poles, who had come by tens of thousands, had been driven to
the wall by the Lithuanians, and now the Lithuanians were giving way to the Slovaks. Who there
was poorer and more miserable than the Slovaks, Grandmother Majauszkiene had no idea, but the
packers would find them, never fear. It was easy to bring them, for wages were really much
higher, and it was only when it was too late that the poor people found out that everything
else was higher too. They were like rats in a trap, that was the truth; and more of them were
piling in every day. By and by they would have their revenge, though, for the thing was getting
beyond human endurance, and the people would rise and murder the packers. Grandmother Majauszkiene
was a socialist, or some such strange thing; another son of hers was working in the mines of
Siberia, and the old lady herself had made speeches in her time--which made her seem all the
more terrible to her present auditors.

They called her back to the story of the house. The German family had been a good sort. To
be sure there had been a great many of them, which was a common failing in Packingtown; but
they had worked hard, and the father had been a steady man, and they had a good deal more than
half paid for the house. But he had been killed in an elevator accident in Durham's.

Then there had come the Irish, and there had been lots of them, too; the husband drank and
beat the children--the neighbors could hear them shrieking any night. They were behind with
their rent all the time, but the company was good to them; there was some politics back of
that, Grandmother Majauszkiene could not say just what, but the Laffertys had belonged to the
"War Whoop League," which was a sort of political club of all the thugs and rowdies in the
district; and if you belonged to that, you could never be arrested for anything. Once upon
a time old Lafferty had been caught with a gang that had stolen cows from several of the poor
people of the neighborhood and butchered them in an old shanty back of the yards and sold them.
He had been in jail only three days for it, and had come out laughing, and had not even lost
his place in the packing house. He had gone all to ruin with the drink, however, and lost his
power; one of his sons, who was a good man, had kept him and the family up for a year or two,
but then he had got sick with consumption.

That was another thing, Grandmother Majauszkiene interrupted herself--this house was unlucky.
Every family that lived in it, some one was sure to get consumption. Nobody could tell why
that was; there must be something about the house, or the way it was built--some folks said
it was because the building had been begun in the dark of the moon. There were dozens of houses
that way in Packingtown. Sometimes there would be a particular room that you could point out--if
anybody slept in that room he was just as good as dead. With this house it had been the Irish
first; and then a Bohemian family had lost a child of it--though, to be sure, that was uncertain,
since it was hard to tell what was the matter with children who worked in the yards. In those
days there had been no law about the age of children--the packers had worked all but the babies.
At this remark the family looked puzzled, and Grandmother Majauszkiene again had to make an
explanation--that it was against the law for children to work before they were sixteen. What
was the sense of that? they asked. They had been thinking of letting little Stanislovas go
to work. Well, there was no need to worry, Grandmother Majauszkiene said--the law made no difference
except that it forced people to lie about the ages of their children. One would like to know
what the lawmakers expected them to do; there were families that had no possible means of support
except the children, and the law provided them no other way of getting a living. Very often
a man could get no work in Packingtown for months, while a child could go and get a place easily;
there was always some new machine, by which the packers could get as much work out of a child
as they had been able to get out of a man, and for a third of the pay.

To come back to the house again, it was the woman of the next family that had died. That was
after they had been there nearly four years, and this woman had had twins regularly every year--and
there had been more than you could count when they moved in. After she died the man would go
to work all day and leave them to shift for themselves--the neighbors would help them now and
then, for they would almost freeze to death. At the end there were three days that they were
alone, before it was found out that the father was dead. He was a "floorsman" at Jones's, and
a wounded steer had broken loose and mashed him against a pillar. Then the children had been
taken away, and the company had sold the house that very same week to a party of emigrants.

So this grim old women went on with her tale of horrors. How much of it was exaggeration--who
could tell? It was only too plausible. There was that about consumption, for instance. They
knew nothing about consumption whatever, except that it made people cough; and for two weeks
they had been worrying about a coughing-spell of Antanas. It seemed to shake him all over,
and it never stopped; you could see a red stain wherever he had spit upon the floor.

And yet all these things were as nothing to what came a little later. They had begun to question
the old lady as to why one family had been unable to pay, trying to show her by figures that
it ought to have been possible; and Grandmother Majauszkiene had disputed their figures--"You
say twelve dollars a month; but that does not include the interest."

Then they stared at her. "Interest!" they cried.

"Interest on the money you still owe," she answered.

"But we don't have to pay any interest!" they exclaimed, three or four at once. "We only have
to pay twelve dollars each month."

And for this she laughed at them. "You are like all the rest," she said; "they trick you and
eat you alive. They never sell the houses without interest. Get your deed, and see."

Then, with a horrible sinking of the heart, Teta Elzbieta unlocked her bureau and brought out
the paper that had already caused them so many agonies. Now they sat round, scarcely breathing,
while the old lady, who could read English, ran over it. "Yes," she said, finally, "here it
is, of course: 'With interest thereon monthly, at the rate of seven per cent per annum.'"

And there followed a dead silence. "What does that mean?" asked Jurgis finally, almost in a
whisper.

"That means," replied the other, "that you have to pay them seven dollars next month, as well
as the twelve dollars."

Then again there was not a sound. It was sickening, like a nightmare, in which suddenly something
gives way beneath you, and you feel yourself sinking, sinking, down into bottomless abysses.
As if in a flash of lightning they saw themselves--victims of a relentless fate, cornered,
trapped, in the grip of destruction. All the fair structure of their hopes came crashing about
their ears.--And all the time the old woman was going on talking. They wished that she would
be still; her voice sounded like the croaking of some dismal raven. Jurgis sat with his hands
clenched and beads of perspiration on his forehead, and there was a great lump in Ona's throat,
choking her. Then suddenly Teta Elzbieta broke the silence with a wail, and Marija began to
wring her hands and sob, "Ai! Ai! Beda man!"

All their outcry did them no good, of course. There sat Grandmother Majauszkiene, unrelenting,
typifying fate. No, of course it was not fair, but then fairness had nothing to do with it.
And of course they had not known it. They had not been intended to know it. But it was in the
deed, and that was all that was necessary, as they would find when the time came.

Somehow or other they got rid of their guest, and then they passed a night of lamentation.
The children woke up and found out that something was wrong, and they wailed and would not
be comforted. In the morning, of course, most of them had to go to work, the packing houses
would not stop for their sorrows; but by seven o'clock Ona and her stepmother were standing
at the door of the office of the agent. Yes, he told them, when he came, it was quite true
that they would have to pay interest. And then Teta Elzbieta broke forth into protestations
and reproaches, so that the people outside stopped and peered in at the window. The agent was
as bland as ever. He was deeply pained, he said. He had not told them, simply because he had
supposed they would understand that they had to pay interest upon their debt, as a matter of
course.

So they came away, and Ona went down to the yards, and at noontime saw Jurgis and told him.
Jurgis took it stolidly--he had made up his mind to it by this time. It was part of fate; they
would manage it somehow--he made his usual answer, "I will work harder." It would upset their
plans for a time; and it would perhaps be necessary for Ona to get work after all. Then Ona
added that Teta Elzbieta had decided that little Stanislovas would have to work too. It was
not fair to let Jurgis and her support the family--the family would have to help as it could.
Previously Jurgis had scouted this idea, but now knit his brows and nodded his head slowly--yes,
perhaps it would be best; they would all have to make some sacrifices now.

So Ona set out that day to hunt for work; and at night Marija came home saying that she had
met a girl named Jasaityte who had a friend that worked in one of the wrapping rooms in Brown's,
and might get a place for Ona there; only the forelady was the kind that takes presents--it
was no use for any one to ask her for a place unless at the same time they slipped a ten-dollar
bill into her hand. Jurgis was not in the least surprised at this now--he merely asked what
the wages of the place would be. So negotiations were opened, and after an interview Ona came
home and reported that the forelady seemed to like her, and had said that, while she was not
sure, she thought she might be able to put her at work sewing covers on hams, a job at which
she would earn as much as eight or ten dollars a week. That was a bid, so Marija reported,
after consulting her friend; and then there was an anxious conference at home. The work was
done in one of the cellars, and Jurgis did not want Ona to work in such a place; but then it
was easy work, and one could not have everything. So in the end Ona, with a ten-dollar bill
burning a hole in her palm, had another interview with the forelady.

Meantime Teta Elzbieta had taken Stanislovas to the priest and gotten a certificate to the
effect that he was two years older than he was; and with it the little boy now sallied forth
to make his fortune in the world. It chanced that Durham had just put in a wonderful new lard
machine, and when the special policeman in front of the time station saw Stanislovas and his
document, he smiled to himself and told him to go--"Czia! Czia!" pointing. And so Stanislovas
went down a long stone corridor, and up a flight of stairs, which took him into a room lighted
by electricity, with the new machines for filling lard cans at work in it. The lard was finished
on the floor above, and it came in little jets, like beautiful, wriggling, snow-white snakes
of unpleasant odor. There were several kinds and sizes of jets, and after a certain precise
quantity had come out, each stopped automatically, and the wonderful machine made a turn, and
took the can under another jet, and so on, until it was filled neatly to the brim, and pressed
tightly, and smoothed off. To attend to all this and fill several hundred cans of lard per
hour, there were necessary two human creatures, one of whom knew how to place an empty lard
can on a certain spot every few seconds, and the other of whom knew how to take a full lard
can off a certain spot every few seconds and set it upon a tray.

And so, after little Stanislovas had stood gazing timidly about him for a few minutes, a man
approached him, and asked what he wanted, to which Stanislovas said, "Job." Then the man said
"How old?" and Stanislovas answered, "Sixtin." Once or twice every year a state inspector would
come wandering through the packing plants, asking a child here and there how old he was; and
so the packers were very careful to comply with the law, which cost them as much trouble as
was now involved in the boss's taking the document from the little boy, and glancing at it,
and then sending it to the office to be filed away. Then he set some one else at a different
job, and showed the lad how to place a lard can every time the empty arm of the remorseless
machine came to him; and so was decided the place in the universe of little Stanislovas, and
his destiny till the end of his days. Hour after hour, day after day, year after year, it was
fated that he should stand upon a certain square foot of floor from seven in the morning until
noon, and again from half-past twelve till half-past five, making never a motion and thinking
never a thought, save for the setting of lard cans. In summer the stench of the warm lard would
be nauseating, and in winter the cans would all but freeze to his naked little fingers in the
unheated cellar. Half the year it would be dark as night when he went in to work, and dark
as night again when he came out, and so he would never know what the sun looked like on weekdays.
And for this, at the end of the week, he would carry home three dollars to his family, being
his pay at the rate of five cents per hour--just about his proper share of the total earnings
of the million and three-quarters of children who are now engaged in earning their livings
in the United States.

And meantime, because they were young, and hope is not to be stifled before its time, Jurgis
and Ona were again calculating; for they had discovered that the wages of Stanislovas would
a little more than pay the interest, which left them just about as they had been before! It
would be but fair to them to say that the little boy was delighted with his work, and at the
idea of earning a lot of money; and also that the two were very much in love with each other.

Chapter 7

All summer long the family toiled, and in the fall they had money enough for Jurgis and Ona
to be married according to home traditions of decency. In the latter part of November they
hired a hall, and invited all their new acquaintances, who came and left them over a hundred
dollars in debt.

It was a bitter and cruel experience, and it plunged them into an agony of despair. Such a
time, of all times, for them to have it, when their hearts were made tender! Such a pitiful
beginning it was for their married life; they loved each other so, and they could not have
the briefest respite! It was a time when everything cried out to them that they ought to be
happy; when wonder burned in their hearts, and leaped into flame at the slightest breath. They
were shaken to the depths of them, with the awe of love realized--and was it so very weak of
them that they cried out for a little peace? They had opened their hearts, like flowers to
the springtime, and the merciless winter had fallen upon them. They wondered if ever any love
that had blossomed in the world had been so crushed and trampled!

Over them, relentless and savage, there cracked the lash of want; the morning after the wedding
it sought them as they slept, and drove them out before daybreak to work. Ona was scarcely
able to stand with exhaustion; but if she were to lose her place they would be ruined, and
she would surely lose it if she were not on time that day. They all had to go, even little
Stanislovas, who was ill from overindulgence in sausages and sarsaparilla. All that day he
stood at his lard machine, rocking unsteadily, his eyes closing in spite of him; and he all
but lost his place even so, for the foreman booted him twice to waken him.

It was fully a week before they were all normal again, and meantime, with whining children
and cross adults, the house was not a pleasant place to live in. Jurgis lost his temper very
little, however, all things considered. It was because of Ona; the least glance at her was
always enough to make him control himself. She was so sensitive--she was not fitted for such
a life as this; and a hundred times a day, when he thought of her, he would clench his hands
and fling himself again at the task before him. She was too good for him, he told himself,
and he was afraid, because she was his. So long he had hungered to possess her, but now that
the time had come he knew that he had not earned the right; that she trusted him so was all
her own simple goodness, and no virtue of his. But he was resolved that she should never find
this out, and so was always on the watch to see that he did not betray any of his ugly self;
he would take care even in little matters, such as his manners, and his habit of swearing when
things went wrong. The tears came so easily into Ona's eyes, and she would look at him so appealingly--it
kept Jurgis quite busy making resolutions, in addition to all the other things he had on his
mind. It was true that more things were going on at this time in the mind of Jurgis than ever
had in all his life before.

He had to protect her, to do battle for her against the horror he saw about them. He was all
that she had to look to, and if he failed she would be lost; he would wrap his arms about her,
and try to hide her from the world. He had learned the ways of things about him now. It was
a war of each against all, and the devil take the hindmost. You did not give feasts to other
people, you waited for them to give feasts to you. You went about with your soul full of suspicion
and hatred; you understood that you were environed by hostile powers that were trying to get
your money, and who used all the virtues to bait their traps with. The store-keepers plastered
up their windows with all sorts of lies to entice you; the very fences by the wayside, the
lampposts and telegraph poles, were pasted over with lies. The great corporation which employed
you lied to you, and lied to the whole country--from top to bottom it was nothing but one gigantic
lie.

So Jurgis said that he understood it; and yet it was really pitiful, for the struggle was so
unfair--some had so much the advantage! Here he was, for instance, vowing upon his knees that
he would save Ona from harm, and only a week later she was suffering atrociously, and from
the blow of an enemy that he could not possibly have thwarted. There came a day when the rain
fell in torrents; and it being December, to be wet with it and have to sit all day long in
one of the cold cellars of Brown's was no laughing matter. Ona was a working girl, and did
not own waterproofs and such things, and so Jurgis took her and put her on the streetcar. Now
it chanced that this car line was owned by gentlemen who were trying to make money. And the
city having passed an ordinance requiring them to give transfers, they had fallen into a rage;
and first they had made a rule that transfers could be had only when the fare was paid; and
later, growing still uglier, they had made another--that the passenger must ask for the transfer,
the conductor was not allowed to offer it. Now Ona had been told that she was to get a transfer;
but it was not her way to speak up, and so she merely waited, following the conductor about
with her eyes, wondering when he would think of her. When at last the time came for her to
get out, she asked for the transfer, and was refused. Not knowing what to make of this, she
began to argue with the conductor, in a language of which he did not understand a word. After
warning her several times, he pulled the bell and the car went on--at which Ona burst into
tears. At the next corner she got out, of course; and as she had no more money, she had to
walk the rest of the way to the yards in the pouring rain. And so all day long she sat shivering,
and came home at night with her teeth chattering and pains in her head and back. For two weeks
afterward she suffered cruelly--and yet every day she had to drag herself to her work. The
forewoman was especially severe with Ona, because she believed that she was obstinate on account
of having been refused a holiday the day after her wedding. Ona had an idea that her "forelady"
did not like to have her girls marry--perhaps because she was old and ugly and unmarried herself.

There were many such dangers, in which the odds were all against them. Their children were
not as well as they had been at home; but how could they know that there was no sewer to their
house, and that the drainage of fifteen years was in a cesspool under it? How could they know
that the pale-blue milk that they bought around the corner was watered, and doctored with formaldehyde
besides? When the children were not well at home, Teta Elzbieta would gather herbs and cure
them; now she was obliged to go to the drugstore and buy extracts--and how was she to know
that they were all adulterated? How could they find out that their tea and coffee, their sugar
and flour, had been doctored; that their canned peas had been colored with copper salts, and
their fruit jams with aniline dyes? And even if they had known it, what good would it have
done them, since there was no place within miles of them where any other sort was to be had?
The bitter winter was coming, and they had to save money to get more clothing and bedding;
but it would not matter in the least how much they saved, they could not get anything to keep
them warm. All the clothing that was to be had in the stores was made of cotton and shoddy,
which is made by tearing old clothes to pieces and weaving the fiber again. If they paid higher
prices, they might get frills and fanciness, or be cheated; but genuine quality they could
not obtain for love nor money. A young friend of Szedvilas', recently come from abroad, had
become a clerk in a store on Ashland Avenue, and he narrated with glee a trick that had been
played upon an unsuspecting countryman by his boss. The customer had desired to purchase an
alarm clock, and the boss had shown him two exactly similar, telling him that the price of
one was a dollar and of the other a dollar seventy-five. Upon being asked what the difference
was, the man had wound up the first halfway and the second all the way, and showed the customer
how the latter made twice as much noise; upon which the customer remarked that he was a sound
sleeper, and had better take the more expensive clock!

There is a poet who sings that

     "Deeper their heart grows and nobler their bearing,
     Whose youth in the fires of anguish hath died."

But it was not likely that he had reference to the kind of anguish that comes with destitution,
that is so endlessly bitter and cruel, and yet so sordid and petty, so ugly, so humiliating--unredeemed
by the slightest touch of dignity or even of pathos. It is a kind of anguish that poets have
not commonly dealt with; its very words are not admitted into the vocabulary of poets--the
details of it cannot be told in polite society at all. How, for instance, could any one expect
to excite sympathy among lovers of good literature by telling how a family found their home
alive with vermin, and of all the suffering and inconvenience and humiliation they were put
to, and the hard-earned money they spent, in efforts to get rid of them? After long hesitation
and uncertainty they paid twenty-five cents for a big package of insect powder--a patent preparation
which chanced to be ninety-five per cent gypsum, a harmless earth which had cost about two
cents to prepare. Of course it had not the least effect, except upon a few roaches which had
the misfortune to drink water after eating it, and so got their inwards set in a coating of
plaster of Paris. The family, having no idea of this, and no more money to throw away, had
nothing to do but give up and submit to one more misery for the rest of their days.

Then there was old Antanas. The winter came, and the place where he worked was a dark, unheated
cellar, where you could see your breath all day, and where your fingers sometimes tried to
freeze. So the old man's cough grew every day worse, until there came a time when it hardly
ever stopped, and he had become a nuisance about the place. Then, too, a still more dreadful
thing happened to him; he worked in a place where his feet were soaked in chemicals, and it
was not long before they had eaten through his new boots. Then sores began to break out on
his feet, and grow worse and worse. Whether it was that his blood was bad, or there had been
a cut, he could not say; but he asked the men about it, and learned that it was a regular thing--it
was the saltpeter. Every one felt it, sooner or later, and then it was all up with him, at
least for that sort of work. The sores would never heal--in the end his toes would drop off,
if he did not quit. Yet old Antanas would not quit; he saw the suffering of his family, and
he remembered what it had cost him to get a job. So he tied up his feet, and went on limping
about and coughing, until at last he fell to pieces, all at once and in a heap, like the One-Horse
Shay. They carried him to a dry place and laid him on the floor, and that night two of the
men helped him home. The poor old man was put to bed, and though he tried it every morning
until the end, he never could get up again. He would lie there and cough and cough, day and
night, wasting away to a mere skeleton. There came a time when there was so little flesh on
him that the bones began to poke through--which was a horrible thing to see or even to think
of. And one night he had a choking fit, and a little river of blood came out of his mouth.
The family, wild with terror, sent for a doctor, and paid half a dollar to be told that there
was nothing to be done. Mercifully the doctor did not say this so that the old man could hear,
for he was still clinging to the faith that tomorrow or next day he would be better, and could
go back to his job. The company had sent word to him that they would keep it for him--or rather
Jurgis had bribed one of the men to come one Sunday afternoon and say they had. Dede Antanas
continued to believe it, while three more hemorrhages came; and then at last one morning they
found him stiff and cold. Things were not going well with them then, and though it nearly broke
Teta Elzbieta's heart, they were forced to dispense with nearly all the decencies of a funeral;
they had only a hearse, and one hack for the women and children; and Jurgis, who was learning
things fast, spent all Sunday making a bargain for these, and he made it in the presence of
witnesses, so that when the man tried to charge him for all sorts of incidentals, he did not
have to pay. For twenty-five years old Antanas Rudkus and his son had dwelt in the forest together,
and it was hard to part in this way; perhaps it was just as well that Jurgis had to give all
his attention to the task of having a funeral without being bankrupted, and so had no time
to indulge in memories and grief.

Now the dreadful winter was come upon them. In the forests, all summer long, the branches of
the trees do battle for light, and some of them lose and die; and then come the raging blasts,
and the storms of snow and hail, and strew the ground with these weaker branches. Just so it
was in Packingtown; the whole district braced itself for the struggle that was an agony, and
those whose time was come died off in hordes. All the year round they had been serving as cogs
in the great packing machine; and now was the time for the renovating of it, and the replacing
of damaged parts. There came pneumonia and grippe, stalking among them, seeking for weakened
constitutions; there was the annual harvest of those whom tuberculosis had been dragging down.
There came cruel, cold, and biting winds, and blizzards of snow, all testing relentlessly for
failing muscles and impoverished blood. Sooner or later came the day when the unfit one did
not report for work; and then, with no time lost in waiting, and no inquiries or regrets, there
was a chance for a new hand.

The new hands were here by the thousands. All day long the gates of the packing houses were
besieged by starving and penniless men; they came, literally, by the thousands every single
morning, fighting with each other for a chance for life. Blizzards and cold made no difference
to them, they were always on hand; they were on hand two hours before the sun rose, an hour
before the work began. Sometimes their faces froze, sometimes their feet and their hands; sometimes
they froze all together--but still they came, for they had no other place to go. One day Durham
advertised in the paper for two hundred men to cut ice; and all that day the homeless and starving
of the city came trudging through the snow from all over its two hundred square miles. That
night forty score of them crowded into the station house of the stockyards district--they filled
the rooms, sleeping in each other's laps, toboggan fashion, and they piled on top of each other
in the corridors, till the police shut the doors and left some to freeze outside. On the morrow,
before daybreak, there were three thousand at Durham's, and the police reserves had to be sent
for to quell the riot. Then Durham's bosses picked out twenty of the biggest; the "two hundred"
proved to have been a printer's error.

Four or five miles to the eastward lay the lake, and over this the bitter winds came raging.
Sometimes the thermometer would fall to ten or twenty degrees below zero at night, and in the
morning the streets would be piled with snowdrifts up to the first-floor windows. The streets
through which our friends had to go to their work were all unpaved and full of deep holes and
gullies; in summer, when it rained hard, a man might have to wade to his waist to get to his
house; and now in winter it was no joke getting through these places, before light in the morning
and after dark at night. They would wrap up in all they owned, but they could not wrap up against
exhaustion; and many a man gave out in these battles with the snowdrifts, and lay down and
fell asleep.

And if it was bad for the men, one may imagine how the women and children fared. Some would
ride in the cars, if the cars were running; but when you are making only five cents an hour,
as was little Stanislovas, you do not like to spend that much to ride two miles. The children
would come to the yards with great shawls about their ears, and so tied up that you could hardly
find them--and still there would be accidents. One bitter morning in February the little boy
who worked at the lard machine with Stanislovas came about an hour late, and screaming with
pain. They unwrapped him, and a man began vigorously rubbing his ears; and as they were frozen
stiff, it took only two or three rubs to break them short off. As a result of this, little
Stanislovas conceived a terror of the cold that was almost a mania. Every morning, when it
came time to start for the yards, he would begin to cry and protest. Nobody knew quite how
to manage him, for threats did no good--it seemed to be something that he could not control,
and they feared sometimes that he would go into convulsions. In the end it had to be arranged
that he always went with Jurgis, and came home with him again; and often, when the snow was
deep, the man would carry him the whole way on his shoulders. Sometimes Jurgis would be working
until late at night, and then it was pitiful, for there was no place for the little fellow
to wait, save in the doorways or in a corner of the killing beds, and he would all but fall
asleep there, and freeze to death.

There was no heat upon the killing beds; the men might exactly as well have worked out of doors
all winter. For that matter, there was very little heat anywhere in the building, except in
the cooking rooms and such places--and it was the men who worked in these who ran the most
risk of all, because whenever they had to pass to another room they had to go through ice-cold
corridors, and sometimes with nothing on above the waist except a sleeveless undershirt. On
the killing beds you were apt to be covered with blood, and it would freeze solid; if you leaned
against a pillar, you would freeze to that, and if you put your hand upon the blade of your
knife, you would run a chance of leaving your skin on it. The men would tie up their feet in
newspapers and old sacks, and these would be soaked in blood and frozen, and then soaked again,
and so on, until by nighttime a man would be walking on great lumps the size of the feet of
an elephant. Now and then, when the bosses were not looking, you would see them plunging their
feet and ankles into the steaming hot carcass of the steer, or darting across the room to the
hot-water jets. The cruelest thing of all was that nearly all of them--all of those who used
knives--were unable to wear gloves, and their arms would be white with frost and their hands
would grow numb, and then of course there would be accidents. Also the air would be full of
steam, from the hot water and the hot blood, so that you could not see five feet before you;
and then, with men rushing about at the speed they kept up on the killing beds, and all with
butcher knives, like razors, in their hands--well, it was to be counted as a wonder that there
were not more men slaughtered than cattle.

And yet all this inconvenience they might have put up with, if only it had not been for one
thing--if only there had been some place where they might eat. Jurgis had either to eat his
dinner amid the stench in which he had worked, or else to rush, as did all his companions,
to any one of the hundreds of liquor stores which stretched out their arms to him. To the west
of the yards ran Ashland Avenue, and here was an unbroken line of saloons--"Whiskey Row," they
called it; to the north was Forty-seventh Street, where there were half a dozen to the block,
and at the angle of the two was "Whiskey Point," a space of fifteen or twenty acres, and containing
one glue factory and about two hundred saloons.

One might walk among these and take his choice: "Hot pea-soup and boiled cabbage today." "Sauerkraut
and hot frankfurters. Walk in." "Bean soup and stewed lamb. Welcome." All of these things were
printed in many languages, as were also the names of the resorts, which were infinite in their
variety and appeal. There was the "Home Circle" and the "Cosey Corner"; there were "Firesides"
and "Hearthstones" and "Pleasure Palaces" and "Wonderlands" and "Dream Castles" and "Love's
Delights." Whatever else they were called, they were sure to be called "Union Headquarters,"
and to hold out a welcome to workingmen; and there was always a warm stove, and a chair near
it, and some friends to laugh and talk with. There was only one condition attached,--you must
drink. If you went in not intending to drink, you would be put out in no time, and if you were
slow about going, like as not you would get your head split open with a beer bottle in the
bargain. But all of the men understood the convention and drank; they believed that by it they
were getting something for nothing--for they did not need to take more than one drink, and
upon the strength of it they might fill themselves up with a good hot dinner. This did not
always work out in practice, however, for there was pretty sure to be a friend who would treat
you, and then you would have to treat him. Then some one else would come in--and, anyhow, a
few drinks were good for a man who worked hard. As he went back he did not shiver so, he had
more courage for his task; the deadly brutalizing monotony of it did not afflict him so,--he
had ideas while he worked, and took a more cheerful view of his circumstances. On the way home,
however, the shivering was apt to come on him again; and so he would have to stop once or twice
to warm up against the cruel cold. As there were hot things to eat in this saloon too, he might
get home late to his supper, or he might not get home at all. And then his wife might set out
to look for him, and she too would feel the cold; and perhaps she would have some of the children
with her--and so a whole family would drift into drinking, as the current of a river drifts
downstream. As if to complete the chain, the packers all paid their men in checks, refusing
all requests to pay in coin; and where in Packingtown could a man go to have his check cashed
but to a saloon, where he could pay for the favor by spending a part of the money?

From all of these things Jurgis was saved because of Ona. He never would take but the one drink
at noontime; and so he got the reputation of being a surly fellow, and was not quite welcome
at the saloons, and had to drift about from one to another. Then at night he would go straight
home, helping Ona and Stanislovas, or often putting the former on a car. And when he got home
perhaps he would have to trudge several blocks, and come staggering back through the snowdrifts
with a bag of coal upon his shoulder. Home was not a very attractive place--at least not this
winter. They had only been able to buy one stove, and this was a small one, and proved not
big enough to warm even the kitchen in the bitterest weather. This made it hard for Teta Elzbieta
all day, and for the children when they could not get to school. At night they would sit huddled
round this stove, while they ate their supper off their laps; and then Jurgis and Jonas would
smoke a pipe, after which they would all crawl into their beds to get warm, after putting out
the fire to save the coal. Then they would have some frightful experiences with the cold. They
would sleep with all their clothes on, including their overcoats, and put over them all the
bedding and spare clothing they owned; the children would sleep all crowded into one bed, and
yet even so they could not keep warm. The outside ones would be shivering and sobbing, crawling
over the others and trying to get down into the center, and causing a fight. This old house
with the leaky weatherboards was a very different thing from their cabins at home, with great
thick walls plastered inside and outside with mud; and the cold which came upon them was a
living thing, a demon-presence in the room. They would waken in the midnight hours, when everything
was black; perhaps they would hear it yelling outside, or perhaps there would be deathlike
stillness--and that would be worse yet. They could feel the cold as it crept in through the
cracks, reaching out for them with its icy, death-dealing fingers; and they would crouch and
cower, and try to hide from it, all in vain. It would come, and it would come; a grisly thing,
a specter born in the black caverns of terror; a power primeval, cosmic, shadowing the tortures
of the lost souls flung out to chaos and destruction. It was cruel iron-hard; and hour after
hour they would cringe in its grasp, alone, alone. There would be no one to hear them if they
cried out; there would be no help, no mercy. And so on until morning--when they would go out
to another day of toil, a little weaker, a little nearer to the time when it would be their
turn to be shaken from the tree.

Chapter 8

Yet even by this deadly winter the germ of hope was not to be kept from sprouting in their
hearts. It was just at this time that the great adventure befell Marija.

The victim was Tamoszius Kuszleika, who played the violin. Everybody laughed at them, for Tamoszius
was petite and frail, and Marija could have picked him up and carried him off under one arm.
But perhaps that was why she fascinated him; the sheer volume of Marija's energy was overwhelming.
That first night at the wedding Tamoszius had hardly taken his eyes off her; and later on,
when he came to find that she had really the heart of a baby, her voice and her violence ceased
to terrify him, and he got the habit of coming to pay her visits on Sunday afternoons. There
was no place to entertain company except in the kitchen, in the midst of the family, and Tamoszius
would sit there with his hat between his knees, never saying more than half a dozen words at
a time, and turning red in the face before he managed to say those; until finally Jurgis would
clap him upon the back, in his hearty way, crying, "Come now, brother, give us a tune." And
then Tamoszius' face would light up and he would get out his fiddle, tuck it under his chin,
and play. And forthwith the soul of him would flame up and become eloquent--it was almost an
impropriety, for all the while his gaze would be fixed upon Marija's face, until she would
begin to turn red and lower her eyes. There was no resisting the music of Tamoszius, however;
even the children would sit awed and wondering, and the tears would run down Teta Elzbieta's
cheeks. A wonderful privilege it was to be thus admitted into the soul of a man of genius,
to be allowed to share the ecstasies and the agonies of his inmost life.

Then there were other benefits accruing to Marija from this friendship--benefits of a more
substantial nature. People paid Tamoszius big money to come and make music on state occasions;
and also they would invite him to parties and festivals, knowing well that he was too good-natured
to come without his fiddle, and that having brought it, he could be made to play while others
danced. Once he made bold to ask Marija to accompany him to such a party, and Marija accepted,
to his great delight--after which he never went anywhere without her, while if the celebration
were given by friends of his, he would invite the rest of the family also. In any case Marija
would bring back a huge pocketful of cakes and sandwiches for the children, and stories of
all the good things she herself had managed to consume. She was compelled, at these parties,
to spend most of her time at the refreshment table, for she could not dance with anybody except
other women and very old men; Tamoszius was of an excitable temperament, and afflicted with
a frantic jealousy, and any unmarried man who ventured to put his arm about the ample waist
of Marija would be certain to throw the orchestra out of tune.

It was a great help to a person who had to toil all the week to be able to look forward to
some such relaxation as this on Saturday nights. The family was too poor and too hardworked
to make many acquaintances; in Packingtown, as a rule, people know only their near neighbors
and shopmates, and so the place is like a myriad of little country villages. But now there
was a member of the family who was permitted to travel and widen her horizon; and so each week
there would be new personalities to talk about,--how so-and-so was dressed, and where she worked,
and what she got, and whom she was in love with; and how this man had jilted his girl, and
how she had quarreled with the other girl, and what had passed between them; and how another
man beat his wife, and spent all her earnings upon drink, and pawned her very clothes. Some
people would have scorned this talk as gossip; but then one has to talk about what one knows.

It was one Saturday night, as they were coming home from a wedding, that Tamoszius found courage,
and set down his violin case in the street and spoke his heart; and then Marija clasped him
in her arms. She told them all about it the next day, and fairly cried with happiness, for
she said that Tamoszius was a lovely man. After that he no longer made love to her with his
fiddle, but they would sit for hours in the kitchen, blissfully happy in each other's arms;
it was the tacit convention of the family to know nothing of what was going on in that corner.

They were planning to be married in the spring, and have the garret of the house fixed up,
and live there. Tamoszius made good wages; and little by little the family were paying back
their debt to Marija, so she ought soon to have enough to start life upon--only, with her preposterous
softheartedness, she would insist upon spending a good part of her money every week for things
which she saw they needed. Marija was really the capitalist of the party, for she had become
an expert can painter by this time--she was getting fourteen cents for every hundred and ten
cans, and she could paint more than two cans every minute. Marija felt, so to speak, that she
had her hand on the throttle, and the neighborhood was vocal with her rejoicings.

Yet her friends would shake their heads and tell her to go slow; one could not count upon such
good fortune forever--there were accidents that always happened. But Marija was not to be prevailed
upon, and went on planning and dreaming of all the treasures she was going to have for her
home; and so, when the crash did come, her grief was painful to see.

For her canning factory shut down! Marija would about as soon have expected to see the sun
shut down--the huge establishment had been to her a thing akin to the planets and the seasons.
But now it was shut! And they had not given her any explanation, they had not even given her
a day's warning; they had simply posted a notice one Saturday that all hands would be paid
off that afternoon, and would not resume work for at least a month! And that was all that there
was to it--her job was gone!

It was the holiday rush that was over, the girls said in answer to Marija's inquiries; after
that there was always a slack. Sometimes the factory would start up on half time after a while,
but there was no telling--it had been known to stay closed until way into the summer. The prospects
were bad at present, for truckmen who worked in the storerooms said that these were piled up
to the ceilings, so that the firm could not have found room for another week's output of cans.
And they had turned off three-quarters of these men, which was a still worse sign, since it
meant that there were no orders to be filled. It was all a swindle, can-painting, said the
girls--you were crazy with delight because you were making twelve or fourteen dollars a week,
and saving half of it; but you had to spend it all keeping alive while you were out, and so
your pay was really only half what you thought.

Marija came home, and because she was a person who could not rest without danger of explosion,
they first had a great house cleaning, and then she set out to search Packingtown for a job
to fill up the gap. As nearly all the canning establishments were shut down, and all the girls
hunting work, it will be readily understood that Marija did not find any. Then she took to
trying the stores and saloons, and when this failed she even traveled over into the far-distant
regions near the lake front, where lived the rich people in great palaces, and begged there
for some sort of work that could be done by a person who did not know English.

The men upon the killing beds felt also the effects of the slump which had turned Marija out;
but they felt it in a different way, and a way which made Jurgis understand at last all their
bitterness. The big packers did not turn their hands off and close down, like the canning factories;
but they began to run for shorter and shorter hours. They had always required the men to be
on the killing beds and ready for work at seven o'clock, although there was almost never any
work to be done till the buyers out in the yards had gotten to work, and some cattle had come
over the chutes. That would often be ten or eleven o'clock, which was bad enough, in all conscience;
but now, in the slack season, they would perhaps not have a thing for their men to do till
late in the afternoon. And so they would have to loaf around, in a place where the thermometer
might be twenty degrees below zero! At first one would see them running about, or skylarking
with each other, trying to keep warm; but before the day was over they would become quite chilled
through and exhausted, and, when the cattle finally came, so near frozen that to move was an
agony. And then suddenly the place would spring into activity, and the merciless "speeding-up"
would begin!

There were weeks at a time when Jurgis went home after such a day as this with not more than
two hours' work to his credit--which meant about thirty-five cents. There were many days when
the total was less than half an hour, and others when there was none at all. The general average
was six hours a day, which meant for Jurgis about six dollars a week; and this six hours of
work would be done after standing on the killing bed till one o'clock, or perhaps even three
or four o'clock, in the afternoon. Like as not there would come a rush of cattle at the very
end of the day, which the men would have to dispose of before they went home, often working
by electric light till nine or ten, or even twelve or one o'clock, and without a single instant
for a bite of supper. The men were at the mercy of the cattle. Perhaps the buyers would be
holding off for better prices--if they could scare the shippers into thinking that they meant
to buy nothing that day, they could get their own terms. For some reason the cost of fodder
for cattle in the yards was much above the market price--and you were not allowed to bring
your own fodder! Then, too, a number of cars were apt to arrive late in the day, now that the
roads were blocked with snow, and the packers would buy their cattle that night, to get them
cheaper, and then would come into play their ironclad rule, that all cattle must be killed
the same day they were bought. There was no use kicking about this--there had been one delegation
after another to see the packers about it, only to be told that it was the rule, and that there
was not the slightest chance of its ever being altered. And so on Christmas Eve Jurgis worked
till nearly one o'clock in the morning, and on Christmas Day he was on the killing bed at seven
o'clock.

All this was bad; and yet it was not the worst. For after all the hard work a man did, he was
paid for only part of it. Jurgis had once been among those who scoffed at the idea of these
huge concerns cheating; and so now he could appreciate the bitter irony of the fact that it
was precisely their size which enabled them to do it with impunity. One of the rules on the
killing beds was that a man who was one minute late was docked an hour; and this was economical,
for he was made to work the balance of the hour--he was not allowed to stand round and wait.
And on the other hand if he came ahead of time he got no pay for that--though often the bosses
would start up the gang ten or fifteen minutes before the whistle. And this same custom they
carried over to the end of the day; they did not pay for any fraction of an hour--for "broken
time." A man might work full fifty minutes, but if there was no work to fill out the hour,
there was no pay for him. Thus the end of every day was a sort of lottery--a struggle, all
but breaking into open war between the bosses and the men, the former trying to rush a job
through and the latter trying to stretch it out. Jurgis blamed the bosses for this, though
the truth to be told it was not always their fault; for the packers kept them frightened for
their lives--and when one was in danger of falling behind the standard, what was easier than
to catch up by making the gang work awhile "for the church"? This was a savage witticism the
men had, which Jurgis had to have explained to him. Old man Jones was great on missions and
such things, and so whenever they were doing some particularly disreputable job, the men would
wink at each other and say, "Now we're working for the church!"

One of the consequences of all these things was that Jurgis was no longer perplexed when he
heard men talk of fighting for their rights. He felt like fighting now himself; and when the
Irish delegate of the butcher-helpers' union came to him a second time, he received him in
a far different spirit. A wonderful idea it now seemed to Jurgis, this of the men--that by
combining they might be able to make a stand and conquer the packers! Jurgis wondered who had
first thought of it; and when he was told that it was a common thing for men to do in America,
he got the first inkling of a meaning in the phrase "a free country." The delegate explained
to him how it depended upon their being able to get every man to join and stand by the organization,
and so Jurgis signified that he was willing to do his share. Before another month was by, all
the working members of his family had union cards, and wore their union buttons conspicuously
and with pride. For fully a week they were quite blissfully happy, thinking that belonging
to a union meant an end to all their troubles.

But only ten days after she had joined, Marija's canning factory closed down, and that blow
quite staggered them. They could not understand why the union had not prevented it, and the
very first time she attended a meeting Marija got up and made a speech about it. It was a business
meeting, and was transacted in English, but that made no difference to Marija; she said what
was in her, and all the pounding of the chairman's gavel and all the uproar and confusion in
the room could not prevail. Quite apart from her own troubles she was boiling over with a general
sense of the injustice of it, and she told what she thought of the packers, and what she thought
of a world where such things were allowed to happen; and then, while the echoes of the hall
rang with the shock of her terrible voice, she sat down again and fanned herself, and the meeting
gathered itself together and proceeded to discuss the election of a recording secretary.

Jurgis too had an adventure the first time he attended a union meeting, but it was not of his
own seeking. Jurgis had gone with the desire to get into an inconspicuous corner and see what
was done; but this attitude of silent and open-eyed attention had marked him out for a victim.
Tommy Finnegan was a little Irishman, with big staring eyes and a wild aspect, a "hoister"
by trade, and badly cracked. Somewhere back in the far-distant past Tommy Finnegan had had
a strange experience, and the burden of it rested upon him. All the balance of his life he
had done nothing but try to make it understood. When he talked he caught his victim by the
buttonhole, and his face kept coming closer and closer--which was trying, because his teeth
were so bad. Jurgis did not mind that, only he was frightened. The method of operation of the
higher intelligences was Tom Finnegan's theme, and he desired to find out if Jurgis had ever
considered that the representation of things in their present similarity might be altogether
unintelligible upon a more elevated plane. There were assuredly wonderful mysteries about the
developing of these things; and then, becoming confidential, Mr. Finnegan proceeded to tell
of some discoveries of his own. "If ye have iver had onything to do wid shperrits," said he,
and looked inquiringly at Jurgis, who kept shaking his head. "Niver mind, niver mind," continued
the other, "but their influences may be operatin' upon ye; it's shure as I'm tellin' ye, it's
them that has the reference to the immejit surroundin's that has the most of power. It was
vouchsafed to me in me youthful days to be acquainted with shperrits" and so Tommy Finnegan
went on, expounding a system of philosophy, while the perspiration came out on Jurgis' forehead,
so great was his agitation and embarrassment. In the end one of the men, seeing his plight,
came over and rescued him; but it was some time before he was able to find any one to explain
things to him, and meanwhile his fear lest the strange little Irishman should get him cornered
again was enough to keep him dodging about the room the whole evening.

He never missed a meeting, however. He had picked up a few words of English by this time, and
friends would help him to understand. They were often very turbulent meetings, with half a
dozen men declaiming at once, in as many dialects of English; but the speakers were all desperately
in earnest, and Jurgis was in earnest too, for he understood that a fight was on, and that
it was his fight. Since the time of his disillusionment, Jurgis had sworn to trust no man,
except in his own family; but here he discovered that he had brothers in affliction, and allies.
Their one chance for life was in union, and so the struggle became a kind of crusade. Jurgis
had always been a member of the church, because it was the right thing to be, but the church
had never touched him, he left all that for the women. Here, however, was a new religion--one
that did touch him, that took hold of every fiber of him; and with all the zeal and fury of
a convert he went out as a missionary. There were many nonunion men among the Lithuanians,
and with these he would labor and wrestle in prayer, trying to show them the right. Sometimes
they would be obstinate and refuse to see it, and Jurgis, alas, was not always patient! He
forgot how he himself had been blind, a short time ago--after the fashion of all crusaders
since the original ones, who set out to spread the gospel of Brotherhood by force of arms.

Chapter 9

One of the first consequences of the discovery of the union was that Jurgis became desirous
of learning English. He wanted to know what was going on at the meetings, and to be able to
take part in them, and so he began to look about him, and to try to pick up words. The children,
who were at school, and learning fast, would teach him a few; and a friend loaned him a little
book that had some in it, and Ona would read them to him. Then Jurgis became sorry that he
could not read himself; and later on in the winter, when some one told him that there was a
night school that was free, he went and enrolled. After that, every evening that he got home
from the yards in time, he would go to the school; he would go even if he were in time for
only half an hour. They were teaching him both to read and to speak English--and they would
have taught him other things, if only he had had a little time.

Also the union made another great difference with him--it made him begin to pay attention to
the country. It was the beginning of democracy with him. It was a little state, the union,
a miniature republic; its affairs were every man's affairs, and every man had a real say about
them. In other words, in the union Jurgis learned to talk politics. In the place where he had
come from there had not been any politics--in Russia one thought of the government as an affliction
like the lightning and the hail. "Duck, little brother, duck," the wise old peasants would
whisper; "everything passes away." And when Jurgis had first come to America he had supposed
that it was the same. He had heard people say that it was a free country--but what did that
mean? He found that here, precisely as in Russia, there were rich men who owned everything;
and if one could not find any work, was not the hunger he began to feel the same sort of hunger?

When Jurgis had been working about three weeks at Brown's, there had come to him one noontime
a man who was employed as a night watchman, and who asked him if he would not like to take
out naturalization papers and become a citizen. Jurgis did not know what that meant, but the
man explained the advantages. In the first place, it would not cost him anything, and it would
get him half a day off, with his pay just the same; and then when election time came he would
be able to vote--and there was something in that. Jurgis was naturally glad to accept, and
so the night watchman said a few words to the boss, and he was excused for the rest of the
day. When, later on, he wanted a holiday to get married he could not get it; and as for a holiday
with pay just the same--what power had wrought that miracle heaven only knew! However, he went
with the man, who picked up several other newly landed immigrants, Poles, Lithuanians, and
Slovaks, and took them all outside, where stood a great four-horse tallyho coach, with fifteen
or twenty men already in it. It was a fine chance to see the sights of the city, and the party
had a merry time, with plenty of beer handed up from inside. So they drove downtown and stopped
before an imposing granite building, in which they interviewed an official, who had the papers
all ready, with only the names to be filled in. So each man in turn took an oath of which he
did not understand a word, and then was presented with a handsome ornamented document with
a big red seal and the shield of the United States upon it, and was told that he had become
a citizen of the Republic and the equal of the President himself.

A month or two later Jurgis had another interview with this same man, who told him where to
go to "register." And then finally, when election day came, the packing houses posted a notice
that men who desired to vote might remain away until nine that morning, and the same night
watchman took Jurgis and the rest of his flock into the back room of a saloon, and showed each
of them where and how to mark a ballot, and then gave each two dollars, and took them to the
polling place, where there was a policeman on duty especially to see that they got through
all right. Jurgis felt quite proud of this good luck till he got home and met Jonas, who had
taken the leader aside and whispered to him, offering to vote three times for four dollars,
which offer had been accepted.

And now in the union Jurgis met men who explained all this mystery to him; and he learned that
America differed from Russia in that its government existed under the form of a democracy.
The officials who ruled it, and got all the graft, had to be elected first; and so there were
two rival sets of grafters, known as political parties, and the one got the office which bought
the most votes. Now and then, the election was very close, and that was the time the poor man
came in. In the stockyards this was only in national and state elections, for in local elections
the Democratic Party always carried everything. The ruler of the district was therefore the
Democratic boss, a little Irishman named Mike Scully. Scully held an important party office
in the state, and bossed even the mayor of the city, it was said; it was his boast that he
carried the stockyards in his pocket. He was an enormously rich man--he had a hand in all the
big graft in the neighborhood. It was Scully, for instance, who owned that dump which Jurgis
and Ona had seen the first day of their arrival. Not only did he own the dump, but he owned
the brick factory as well, and first he took out the clay and made it into bricks, and then
he had the city bring garbage to fill up the hole, so that he could build houses to sell to
the people. Then, too, he sold the bricks to the city, at his own price, and the city came
and got them in its own wagons. And also he owned the other hole near by, where the stagnant
water was; and it was he who cut the ice and sold it; and what was more, if the men told truth,
he had not had to pay any taxes for the water, and he had built the icehouse out of city lumber,
and had not had to pay anything for that. The newspapers had got hold of that story, and there
had been a scandal; but Scully had hired somebody to confess and take all the blame, and then
skip the country. It was said, too, that he had built his brick-kiln in the same way, and that
the workmen were on the city payroll while they did it; however, one had to press closely to
get these things out of the men, for it was not their business, and Mike Scully was a good
man to stand in with. A note signed by him was equal to a job any time at the packing houses;
and also he employed a good many men himself, and worked them only eight hours a day, and paid
them the highest wages. This gave him many friends--all of whom he had gotten together into
the "War Whoop League," whose clubhouse you might see just outside of the yards. It was the
biggest clubhouse, and the biggest club, in all Chicago; and they had prizefights every now
and then, and cockfights and even dogfights. The policemen in the district all belonged to
the league, and instead of suppressing the fights, they sold tickets for them. The man that
had taken Jurgis to be naturalized was one of these "Indians," as they were called; and on
election day there would be hundreds of them out, and all with big wads of money in their pockets
and free drinks at every saloon in the district. That was another thing, the men said--all
the saloon-keepers had to be "Indians," and to put up on demand, otherwise they could not do
business on Sundays, nor have any gambling at all. In the same way Scully had all the jobs
in the fire department at his disposal, and all the rest of the city graft in the stockyards
district; he was building a block of flats somewhere up on Ashland Avenue, and the man who
was overseeing it for him was drawing pay as a city inspector of sewers. The city inspector
of water pipes had been dead and buried for over a year, but somebody was still drawing his
pay. The city inspector of sidewalks was a barkeeper at the War Whoop Cafe--and maybe he could
make it uncomfortable for any tradesman who did not stand in with Scully!

Even the packers were in awe of him, so the men said. It gave them pleasure to believe this,
for Scully stood as the people's man, and boasted of it boldly when election day came. The
packers had wanted a bridge at Ashland Avenue, but they had not been able to get it till they
had seen Scully; and it was the same with "Bubbly Creek," which the city had threatened to
make the packers cover over, till Scully had come to their aid. "Bubbly Creek" is an arm of
the Chicago River, and forms the southern boundary of the yards: all the drainage of the square
mile of packing houses empties into it, so that it is really a great open sewer a hundred or
two feet wide. One long arm of it is blind, and the filth stays there forever and a day. The
grease and chemicals that are poured into it undergo all sorts of strange transformations,
which are the cause of its name; it is constantly in motion, as if huge fish were feeding in
it, or great leviathans disporting themselves in its depths. Bubbles of carbonic acid gas will
rise to the surface and burst, and make rings two or three feet wide. Here and there the grease
and filth have caked solid, and the creek looks like a bed of lava; chickens walk about on
it, feeding, and many times an unwary stranger has started to stroll across, and vanished temporarily.
The packers used to leave the creek that way, till every now and then the surface would catch
on fire and burn furiously, and the fire department would have to come and put it out. Once,
however, an ingenious stranger came and started to gather this filth in scows, to make lard
out of; then the packers took the cue, and got out an injunction to stop him, and afterward
gathered it themselves. The banks of "Bubbly Creek" are plastered thick with hairs, and this
also the packers gather and clean.

And there were things even stranger than this, according to the gossip of the men. The packers
had secret mains, through which they stole billions of gallons of the city's water. The newspapers
had been full of this scandal--once there had even been an investigation, and an actual uncovering
of the pipes; but nobody had been punished, and the thing went right on. And then there was
the condemned meat industry, with its endless horrors. The people of Chicago saw the government
inspectors in Packingtown, and they all took that to mean that they were protected from diseased
meat; they did not understand that these hundred and sixty-three inspectors had been appointed
at the request of the packers, and that they were paid by the United States government to certify
that all the diseased meat was kept in the state. They had no authority beyond that; for the
inspection of meat to be sold in the city and state the whole force in Packingtown consisted
of three henchmen of the local political machine!*

     (*Rules and Regulations for the Inspection of Livestock and
     Their Products. United States Department of Agriculture,
     Bureau of Animal Industries, Order No. 125:--

     Section 1. Proprietors of slaughterhouses, canning, salting,
     packing, or rendering establishments engaged in the
     slaughtering of cattle, sheep. or swine, or the packing of
     any of their products, the carcasses or products of which
     are to become subjects of interstate or foreign commerce,
     shall make application to the Secretary of Agriculture for
     inspection of said animals and their products....

     Section 15. Such rejected or condemned animals shall at once
     be removed by the owners from the pens containing animals
     which have been inspected and found to be free from disease
     and fit for human food, and shall be disposed of in
     accordance with the laws, ordinances, and regulations of the
     state and municipality in which said rejected or condemned
     animals are located....

     Section 25. A microscopic examination for trichinae shall be
     made of all swine products exported to countries requiring
     such examination. No microscopic examination will be made of
     hogs slaughtered for interstate trade, but this examination
     shall be confined to those intended for the export trade.)

And shortly afterward one of these, a physician, made the discovery that the carcasses of steers
which had been condemned as tubercular by the government inspectors, and which therefore contained
ptomaines, which are deadly poisons, were left upon an open platform and carted away to be
sold in the city; and so he insisted that these carcasses be treated with an injection of kerosene--and
was ordered to resign the same week! So indignant were the packers that they went farther,
and compelled the mayor to abolish the whole bureau of inspection; so that since then there
has not been even a pretense of any interference with the graft. There was said to be two thousand
dollars a week hush money from the tubercular steers alone; and as much again from the hogs
which had died of cholera on the trains, and which you might see any day being loaded into
boxcars and hauled away to a place called Globe, in Indiana, where they made a fancy grade of lard.

Jurgis heard of these things little by little, in the gossip of those who were obliged to perpetrate
them. It seemed as if every time you met a person from a new department, you heard of new swindles
and new crimes. There was, for instance, a Lithuanian who was a cattle butcher for the plant
where Marija had worked, which killed meat for canning only; and to hear this man describe
the animals which came to his place would have been worthwhile for a Dante or a Zola. It seemed
that they must have agencies all over the country, to hunt out old and crippled and diseased
cattle to be canned. There were cattle which had been fed on "whisky-malt," the refuse of the
breweries, and had become what the men called "steerly"--which means covered with boils. It
was a nasty job killing these, for when you plunged your knife into them they would burst and
splash foul-smelling stuff into your face; and when a man's sleeves were smeared with blood,
and his hands steeped in it, how was he ever to wipe his face, or to clear his eyes so that
he could see? It was stuff such as this that made the "embalmed beef" that had killed several
times as many United States soldiers as all the bullets of the Spaniards; only the army beef,
besides, was not fresh canned, it was old stuff that had been lying for years in the cellars.

Then one Sunday evening, Jurgis sat puffing his pipe by the kitchen stove, and talking with
an old fellow whom Jonas had introduced, and who worked in the canning rooms at Durham's; and
so Jurgis learned a few things about the great and only Durham canned goods, which had become
a national institution. They were regular alchemists at Durham's; they advertised a mushroom-catsup,
and the men who made it did not know what a mushroom looked like. They advertised "potted chicken,"--and
it was like the boardinghouse soup of the comic papers, through which a chicken had walked
with rubbers on. Perhaps they had a secret process for making chickens chemically--who knows?
said Jurgis' friend; the things that went into the mixture were tripe, and the fat of pork,
and beef suet, and hearts of beef, and finally the waste ends of veal, when they had any. They
put these up in several grades, and sold them at several prices; but the contents of the cans
all came out of the same hopper. And then there was "potted game" and "potted grouse," "potted
ham," and "deviled ham"--de-vyled, as the men called it. "De-vyled" ham was made out of the
waste ends of smoked beef that were too small to be sliced by the machines; and also tripe,
dyed with chemicals so that it would not show white; and trimmings of hams and corned beef;
and potatoes, skins and all; and finally the hard cartilaginous gullets of beef, after the
tongues had been cut out. All this ingenious mixture was ground up and flavored with spices
to make it taste like something. Anybody who could invent a new imitation had been sure of
a fortune from old Durham, said Jurgis' informant; but it was hard to think of anything new
in a place where so many sharp wits had been at work for so long; where men welcomed tuberculosis
in the cattle they were feeding, because it made them fatten more quickly; and where they bought
up all the old rancid butter left over in the grocery stores of a continent, and "oxidized"
it by a forced-air process, to take away the odor, rechurned it with skim milk, and sold it
in bricks in the cities! Up to a year or two ago it had been the custom to kill horses in the
yards--ostensibly for fertilizer; but after long agitation the newspapers had been able to
make the public realize that the horses were being canned. Now it was against the law to kill
horses in Packingtown, and the law was really complied with--for the present, at any rate.
Any day, however, one might see sharp-horned and shaggy-haired creatures running with the sheep
and yet what a job you would have to get the public to believe that a good part of what it
buys for lamb and mutton is really goat's flesh!

There was another interesting set of statistics that a person might have gathered in Packingtown--those
of the various afflictions of the workers. When Jurgis had first inspected the packing plants
with Szedvilas, he had marveled while he listened to the tale of all the things that were made
out of the carcasses of animals, and of all the lesser industries that were maintained there;
now he found that each one of these lesser industries was a separate little inferno, in its
way as horrible as the killing beds, the source and fountain of them all. The workers in each
of them had their own peculiar diseases. And the wandering visitor might be skeptical about
all the swindles, but he could not be skeptical about these, for the worker bore the evidence
of them about on his own person--generally he had only to hold out his hand.

There were the men in the pickle rooms, for instance, where old Antanas had gotten his death;
scarce a one of these that had not some spot of horror on his person. Let a man so much as
scrape his finger pushing a truck in the pickle rooms, and he might have a sore that would
put him out of the world; all the joints in his fingers might be eaten by the acid, one by
one. Of the butchers and floorsmen, the beef-boners and trimmers, and all those who used knives,
you could scarcely find a person who had the use of his thumb; time and time again the base
of it had been slashed, till it was a mere lump of flesh against which the man pressed the
knife to hold it. The hands of these men would be criss-crossed with cuts, until you could
no longer pretend to count them or to trace them. They would have no nails,--they had worn
them off pulling hides; their knuckles were swollen so that their fingers spread out like a
fan. There were men who worked in the cooking rooms, in the midst of steam and sickening odors,
by artificial light; in these rooms the germs of tuberculosis might live for two years, but
the supply was renewed every hour. There were the beef-luggers, who carried two-hundred-pound
quarters into the refrigerator-cars; a fearful kind of work, that began at four o'clock in
the morning, and that wore out the most powerful men in a few years. There were those who worked
in the chilling rooms, and whose special disease was rheumatism; the time limit that a man
could work in the chilling rooms was said to be five years. There were the wool-pluckers, whose
hands went to pieces even sooner than the hands of the pickle men; for the pelts of the sheep
had to be painted with acid to loosen the wool, and then the pluckers had to pull out this
wool with their bare hands, till the acid had eaten their fingers off. There were those who
made the tins for the canned meat; and their hands, too, were a maze of cuts, and each cut
represented a chance for blood poisoning. Some worked at the stamping machines, and it was
very seldom that one could work long there at the pace that was set, and not give out and forget
himself and have a part of his hand chopped off. There were the "hoisters," as they were called,
whose task it was to press the lever which lifted the dead cattle off the floor. They ran along
upon a rafter, peering down through the damp and the steam; and as old Durham's architects
had not built the killing room for the convenience of the hoisters, at every few feet they
would have to stoop under a beam, say four feet above the one they ran on; which got them into
the habit of stooping, so that in a few years they would be walking like chimpanzees. Worst
of any, however, were the fertilizer men, and those who served in the cooking rooms. These
people could not be shown to the visitor,--for the odor of a fertilizer man would scare any
ordinary visitor at a hundred yards, and as for the other men, who worked in tank rooms full
of steam, and in some of which there were open vats near the level of the floor, their peculiar
trouble was that they fell into the vats; and when they were fished out, there was never enough
of them left to be worth exhibiting,--sometimes they would be overlooked for days, till all
but the bones of them had gone out to the world as Durham's Pure Leaf Lard!

Chapter 10

During the early part of the winter the family had had money enough to live and a little over
to pay their debts with; but when the earnings of Jurgis fell from nine or ten dollars a week
to five or six, there was no longer anything to spare. The winter went, and the spring came,
and found them still living thus from hand to mouth, hanging on day by day, with literally
not a month's wages between them and starvation. Marija was in despair, for there was still
no word about the reopening of the canning factory, and her savings were almost entirely gone.
She had had to give up all idea of marrying then; the family could not get along without her--though
for that matter she was likely soon to become a burden even upon them, for when her money was
all gone, they would have to pay back what they owed her in board. So Jurgis and Ona and Teta
Elzbieta would hold anxious conferences until late at night, trying to figure how they could
manage this too without starving.

Such were the cruel terms upon which their life was possible, that they might never have nor
expect a single instant's respite from worry, a single instant in which they were not haunted
by the thought of money. They would no sooner escape, as by a miracle, from one difficulty,
than a new one would come into view. In addition to all their physical hardships, there was
thus a constant strain upon their minds; they were harried all day and nearly all night by
worry and fear. This was in truth not living; it was scarcely even existing, and they felt
that it was too little for the price they paid. They were willing to work all the time; and
when people did their best, ought they not to be able to keep alive?

There seemed never to be an end to the things they had to buy and to the unforeseen contingencies.
Once their water pipes froze and burst; and when, in their ignorance, they thawed them out,
they had a terrifying flood in their house. It happened while the men were away, and poor Elzbieta
rushed out into the street screaming for help, for she did not even know whether the flood
could be stopped, or whether they were ruined for life. It was nearly as bad as the latter,
they found in the end, for the plumber charged them seventy-five cents an hour, and seventy-five
cents for another man who had stood and watched him, and included all the time the two had
been going and coming, and also a charge for all sorts of material and extras. And then again,
when they went to pay their January's installment on the house, the agent terrified them by
asking them if they had had the insurance attended to yet. In answer to their inquiry he showed
them a clause in the deed which provided that they were to keep the house insured for one thousand
dollars, as soon as the present policy ran out, which would happen in a few days. Poor Elzbieta,
upon whom again fell the blow, demanded how much it would cost them. Seven dollars, the man
said; and that night came Jurgis, grim and determined, requesting that the agent would be good
enough to inform him, once for all, as to all the expenses they were liable for. The deed was
signed now, he said, with sarcasm proper to the new way of life he had learned--the deed was
signed, and so the agent had no longer anything to gain by keeping quiet. And Jurgis looked
the fellow squarely in the eye, and so the fellow wasted no time in conventional protests,
but read him the deed. They would have to renew the insurance every year; they would have to
pay the taxes, about ten dollars a year; they would have to pay the water tax, about six dollars
a year--(Jurgis silently resolved to shut off the hydrant). This, besides the interest and
the monthly installments, would be all--unless by chance the city should happen to decide to
put in a sewer or to lay a sidewalk. Yes, said the agent, they would have to have these, whether
they wanted them or not, if the city said so. The sewer would cost them about twenty-two dollars,
and the sidewalk fifteen if it were wood, twenty-five if it were cement.

So Jurgis went home again; it was a relief to know the worst, at any rate, so that he could
no more be surprised by fresh demands. He saw now how they had been plundered; but they were
in for it, there was no turning back. They could only go on and make the fight and win--for
defeat was a thing that could not even be thought of.

When the springtime came, they were delivered from the dreadful cold, and that was a great
deal; but in addition they had counted on the money they would not have to pay for coal--and
it was just at this time that Marija's board began to fail. Then, too, the warm weather brought
trials of its own; each season had its trials, as they found. In the spring there were cold
rains, that turned the streets into canals and bogs; the mud would be so deep that wagons would
sink up to the hubs, so that half a dozen horses could not move them. Then, of course, it was
impossible for any one to get to work with dry feet; and this was bad for men that were poorly
clad and shod, and still worse for women and children. Later came midsummer, with the stifling
heat, when the dingy killing beds of Durham's became a very purgatory; one time, in a single
day, three men fell dead from sunstroke. All day long the rivers of hot blood poured forth,
until, with the sun beating down, and the air motionless, the stench was enough to knock a
man over; all the old smells of a generation would be drawn out by this heat--for there was
never any washing of the walls and rafters and pillars, and they were caked with the filth
of a lifetime. The men who worked on the killing beds would come to reek with foulness, so
that you could smell one of them fifty feet away; there was simply no such thing as keeping
decent, the most careful man gave it up in the end, and wallowed in uncleanness. There was
not even a place where a man could wash his hands, and the men ate as much raw blood as food
at dinnertime. When they were at work they could not even wipe off their faces--they were as
helpless as newly born babes in that respect; and it may seem like a small matter, but when
the sweat began to run down their necks and tickle them, or a fly to bother them, it was a
torture like being burned alive. Whether it was the slaughterhouses or the dumps that were
responsible, one could not say, but with the hot weather there descended upon Packingtown a
veritable Egyptian plague of flies; there could be no describing this--the houses would be
black with them. There was no escaping; you might provide all your doors and windows with screens,
but their buzzing outside would be like the swarming of bees, and whenever you opened the door
they would rush in as if a storm of wind were driving them.

Perhaps the summertime suggests to you thoughts of the country, visions of green fields and
mountains and sparkling lakes. It had no such suggestion for the people in the yards. The great
packing machine ground on remorselessly, without thinking of green fields; and the men and
women and children who were part of it never saw any green thing, not even a flower. Four or
five miles to the east of them lay the blue waters of Lake Michigan; but for all the good it
did them it might have been as far away as the Pacific Ocean. They had only Sundays, and then
they were too tired to walk. They were tied to the great packing machine, and tied to it for
life. The managers and superintendents and clerks of Packingtown were all recruited from another
class, and never from the workers; they scorned the workers, the very meanest of them. A poor
devil of a bookkeeper who had been working in Durham's for twenty years at a salary of six
dollars a week, and might work there for twenty more and do no better, would yet consider himself
a gentleman, as far removed as the poles from the most skilled worker on the killing beds;
he would dress differently, and live in another part of the town, and come to work at a different
hour of the day, and in every way make sure that he never rubbed elbows with a laboring man.
Perhaps this was due to the repulsiveness of the work; at any rate, the people who worked with
their hands were a class apart, and were made to feel it.

In the late spring the canning factory started up again, and so once more Marija was heard
to sing, and the love-music of Tamoszius took on a less melancholy tone. It was not for long,
however; for a month or two later a dreadful calamity fell upon Marija. Just one year and three
days after she had begun work as a can-painter, she lost her job.

It was a long story. Marija insisted that it was because of her activity in the union. The
packers, of course, had spies in all the unions, and in addition they made a practice of buying
up a certain number of the union officials, as many as they thought they needed. So every week
they received reports as to what was going on, and often they knew things before the members
of the union knew them. Any one who was considered to be dangerous by them would find that
he was not a favorite with his boss; and Marija had been a great hand for going after the foreign
people and preaching to them. However that might be, the known facts were that a few weeks
before the factory closed, Marija had been cheated out of her pay for three hundred cans. The
girls worked at a long table, and behind them walked a woman with pencil and notebook, keeping
count of the number they finished. This woman was, of course, only human, and sometimes made
mistakes; when this happened, there was no redress--if on Saturday you got less money than
you had earned, you had to make the best of it. But Marija did not understand this, and made
a disturbance. Marija's disturbances did not mean anything, and while she had known only Lithuanian
and Polish, they had done no harm, for people only laughed at her and made her cry. But now
Marija was able to call names in English, and so she got the woman who made the mistake to
disliking her. Probably, as Marija claimed, she made mistakes on purpose after that; at any
rate, she made them, and the third time it happened Marija went on the warpath and took the
matter first to the forelady, and when she got no satisfaction there, to the superintendent.
This was unheard-of presumption, but the superintendent said he would see about it, which Marija
took to mean that she was going to get her money; after waiting three days, she went to see
the superintendent again. This time the man frowned, and said that he had not had time to attend
to it; and when Marija, against the advice and warning of every one, tried it once more, he
ordered her back to her work in a passion. Just how things happened after that Marija was not
sure, but that afternoon the forelady told her that her services would not be any longer required.
Poor Marija could not have been more dumfounded had the woman knocked her over the head; at
first she could not believe what she heard, and then she grew furious and swore that she would
come anyway, that her place belonged to her. In the end she sat down in the middle of the floor
and wept and wailed.

It was a cruel lesson; but then Marija was headstrong--she should have listened to those who
had had experience. The next time she would know her place, as the forelady expressed it; and
so Marija went out, and the family faced the problem of an existence again.

It was especially hard this time, for Ona was to be confined before long, and Jurgis was trying
hard to save up money for this. He had heard dreadful stories of the midwives, who grow as
thick as fleas in Packingtown; and he had made up his mind that Ona must have a man-doctor.
Jurgis could be very obstinate when he wanted to, and he was in this case, much to the dismay
of the women, who felt that a man-doctor was an impropriety, and that the matter really belonged
to them. The cheapest doctor they could find would charge them fifteen dollars, and perhaps
more when the bill came in; and here was Jurgis, declaring that he would pay it, even if he
had to stop eating in the meantime!

Marija had only about twenty-five dollars left. Day after day she wandered about the yards
begging a job, but this time without hope of finding it. Marija could do the work of an able-bodied
man, when she was cheerful, but discouragement wore her out easily, and she would come home
at night a pitiable object. She learned her lesson this time, poor creature; she learned it
ten times over. All the family learned it along with her--that when you have once got a job
in Packingtown, you hang on to it, come what will.

Four weeks Marija hunted, and half of a fifth week. Of course she stopped paying her dues to
the union. She lost all interest in the union, and cursed herself for a fool that she had ever
been dragged into one. She had about made up her mind that she was a lost soul, when somebody
told her of an opening, and she went and got a place as a "beef-trimmer." She got this because
the boss saw that she had the muscles of a man, and so he discharged a man and put Marija to
do his work, paying her a little more than half what he had been paying before.

When she first came to Packingtown, Marija would have scorned such work as this. She was in
another canning factory, and her work was to trim the meat of those diseased cattle that Jurgis
had been told about not long before. She was shut up in one of the rooms where the people seldom
saw the daylight; beneath her were the chilling rooms, where the meat was frozen, and above
her were the cooking rooms; and so she stood on an ice-cold floor, while her head was often
so hot that she could scarcely breathe. Trimming beef off the bones by the hundred-weight,
while standing up from early morning till late at night, with heavy boots on and the floor
always damp and full of puddles, liable to be thrown out of work indefinitely because of a
slackening in the trade, liable again to be kept overtime in rush seasons, and be worked till
she trembled in every nerve and lost her grip on her slimy knife, and gave herself a poisoned
wound--that was the new life that unfolded itself before Marija. But because Marija was a human
horse she merely laughed and went at it; it would enable her to pay her board again, and keep
the family going. And as for Tamoszius--well, they had waited a long time, and they could wait
a little longer. They could not possibly get along upon his wages alone, and the family could
not live without hers. He could come and visit her, and sit in the kitchen and hold her hand,
and he must manage to be content with that. But day by day the music of Tamoszius' violin became
more passionate and heartbreaking; and Marija would sit with her hands clasped and her cheeks
wet and all her body atremble, hearing in the wailing melodies the voices of the unborn generations
which cried out in her for life.

Marija's lesson came just in time to save Ona from a similar fate. Ona, too, was dissatisfied
with her place, and had far more reason than Marija. She did not tell half of her story at
home, because she saw it was a torment to Jurgis, and she was afraid of what he might do. For
a long time Ona had seen that Miss Henderson, the forelady in her department, did not like
her. At first she thought it was the old-time mistake she had made in asking for a holiday
to get married. Then she concluded it must be because she did not give the forelady a present
occasionally--she was the kind that took presents from the girls, Ona learned, and made all
sorts of discriminations in favor of those who gave them. In the end, however, Ona discovered
that it was even worse than that. Miss Henderson was a newcomer, and it was some time before
rumor made her out; but finally it transpired that she was a kept woman, the former mistress
of the superintendent of a department in the same building. He had put her there to keep her
quiet, it seemed--and that not altogether with success, for once or twice they had been heard
quarreling. She had the temper of a hyena, and soon the place she ran was a witch's caldron.
There were some of the girls who were of her own sort, who were willing to toady to her and
flatter her; and these would carry tales about the rest, and so the furies were unchained in
the place. Worse than this, the woman lived in a bawdyhouse downtown, with a coarse, red-faced
Irishman named Connor, who was the boss of the loading-gang outside, and would make free with
the girls as they went to and from their work. In the slack seasons some of them would go with
Miss Henderson to this house downtown--in fact, it would not be too much to say that she managed
her department at Brown's in conjunction with it. Sometimes women from the house would be given
places alongside of decent girls, and after other decent girls had been turned off to make
room for them. When you worked in this woman's department the house downtown was never out
of your thoughts all day--there were always whiffs of it to be caught, like the odor of the
Packingtown rendering plants at night, when the wind shifted suddenly. There would be stories
about it going the rounds; the girls opposite you would be telling them and winking at you.
In such a place Ona would not have stayed a day, but for starvation; and, as it was, she was
never sure that she could stay the next day. She understood now that the real reason that Miss
Henderson hated her was that she was a decent married girl; and she knew that the talebearers
and the toadies hated her for the same reason, and were doing their best to make her life miserable.

But there was no place a girl could go in Packingtown, if she was particular about things of
this sort; there was no place in it where a prostitute could not get along better than a decent
girl. Here was a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation,
and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous
as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances immorality was exactly as inevitable,
and as prevalent, as it was under the system of chattel slavery. Things that were quite unspeakable
went on there in the packing houses all the time, and were taken for granted by everybody;
only they did not show, as in the old slavery times, because there was no difference in color
between master and slave.

One morning Ona stayed home, and Jurgis had the man-doctor, according to his whim, and she
was safely delivered of a fine baby. It was an enormous big boy, and Ona was such a tiny creature
herself, that it seemed quite incredible. Jurgis would stand and gaze at the stranger by the
hour, unable to believe that it had really happened.

The coming of this boy was a decisive event with Jurgis. It made him irrevocably a family man;
it killed the last lingering impulse that he might have had to go out in the evenings and sit
and talk with the men in the saloons. There was nothing he cared for now so much as to sit
and look at the baby. This was very curious, for Jurgis had never been interested in babies
before. But then, this was a very unusual sort of a baby. He had the brightest little black
eyes, and little black ringlets all over his head; he was the living image of his father, everybody
said--and Jurgis found this a fascinating circumstance. It was sufficiently perplexing that
this tiny mite of life should have come into the world at all in the manner that it had; that
it should have come with a comical imitation of its father's nose was simply uncanny.

Perhaps, Jurgis thought, this was intended to signify that it was his baby; that it was his
and Ona's, to care for all its life. Jurgis had never possessed anything nearly so interesting--a
baby was, when you came to think about it, assuredly a marvelous possession. It would grow
up to be a man, a human soul, with a personality all its own, a will of its own! Such thoughts
would keep haunting Jurgis, filling him with all sorts of strange and almost painful excitements.
He was wonderfully proud of little Antanas; he was curious about all the details of him--the
washing and the dressing and the eating and the sleeping of him, and asked all sorts of absurd
questions. It took him quite a while to get over his alarm at the incredible shortness of the
little creature's legs.

Jurgis had, alas, very little time to see his baby; he never felt the chains about him more
than just then. When he came home at night, the baby would be asleep, and it would be the merest
chance if he awoke before Jurgis had to go to sleep himself. Then in the morning there was
no time to look at him, so really the only chance the father had was on Sundays. This was more
cruel yet for Ona, who ought to have stayed home and nursed him, the doctor said, for her own
health as well as the baby's; but Ona had to go to work, and leave him for Teta Elzbieta to
feed upon the pale blue poison that was called milk at the corner grocery. Ona's confinement
lost her only a week's wages--she would go to the factory the second Monday, and the best that
Jurgis could persuade her was to ride in the car, and let him run along behind and help her
to Brown's when she alighted. After that it would be all right, said Ona, it was no strain
sitting still sewing hams all day; and if she waited longer she might find that her dreadful
forelady had put some one else in her place. That would be a greater calamity than ever now,
Ona continued, on account of the baby. They would all have to work harder now on his account.
It was such a responsibility--they must not have the baby grow up to suffer as they had. And
this indeed had been the first thing that Jurgis had thought of himself--he had clenched his
hands and braced himself anew for the struggle, for the sake of that tiny mite of human possibility.

And so Ona went back to Brown's and saved her place and a week's wages; and so she gave herself
some one of the thousand ailments that women group under the title of "womb trouble," and was
never again a well person as long as she lived. It is difficult to convey in words all that
this meant to Ona; it seemed such a slight offense, and the punishment was so out of all proportion,
that neither she nor any one else ever connected the two. "Womb trouble" to Ona did not mean
a specialist's diagnosis, and a course of treatment, and perhaps an operation or two; it meant
simply headaches and pains in the back, and depression and heartsickness, and neuralgia when
she had to go to work in the rain. The great majority of the women who worked in Packingtown
suffered in the same way, and from the same cause, so it was not deemed a thing to see the
doctor about; instead Ona would try patent medicines, one after another, as her friends told
her about them. As these all contained alcohol, or some other stimulant, she found that they
all did her good while she took them; and so she was always chasing the phantom of good health,
and losing it because she was too poor to continue.

Chapter 11

During the summer the packing houses were in full activity again, and Jurgis made more money.
He did not make so much, however, as he had the previous summer, for the packers took on more
hands. There were new men every week, it seemed--it was a regular system; and this number they
would keep over to the next slack season, so that every one would have less than ever. Sooner
or later, by this plan, they would have all the floating labor of Chicago trained to do their
work. And how very cunning a trick was that! The men were to teach new hands, who would some
day come and break their strike; and meantime they were kept so poor that they could not prepare
for the trial!

But let no one suppose that this superfluity of employees meant easier work for any one! On
the contrary, the speeding-up seemed to be growing more savage all the time; they were continually
inventing new devices to crowd the work on--it was for all the world like the thumbscrew of
the medieval torture chamber. They would get new pacemakers and pay them more; they would drive
the men on with new machinery--it was said that in the hog-killing rooms the speed at which
the hogs moved was determined by clockwork, and that it was increased a little every day. In
piecework they would reduce the time, requiring the same work in a shorter time, and paying
the same wages; and then, after the workers had accustomed themselves to this new speed, they
would reduce the rate of payment to correspond with the reduction in time! They had done this
so often in the canning establishments that the girls were fairly desperate; their wages had
gone down by a full third in the past two years, and a storm of discontent was brewing that
was likely to break any day. Only a month after Marija had become a beef-trimmer the canning
factory that she had left posted a cut that would divide the girls' earnings almost squarely
in half; and so great was the indignation at this that they marched out without even a parley,
and organized in the street outside. One of the girls had read somewhere that a red flag was
the proper symbol for oppressed workers, and so they mounted one, and paraded all about the
yards, yelling with rage. A new union was the result of this outburst, but the impromptu strike
went to pieces in three days, owing to the rush of new labor. At the end of it the girl who
had carried the red flag went downtown and got a position in a great department store, at a
salary of two dollars and a half a week.

Jurgis and Ona heard these stories with dismay, for there was no telling when their own time
might come. Once or twice there had been rumors that one of the big houses was going to cut
its unskilled men to fifteen cents an hour, and Jurgis knew that if this was done, his turn
would come soon. He had learned by this time that Packingtown was really not a number of firms
at all, but one great firm, the Beef Trust. And every week the managers of it got together
and compared notes, and there was one scale for all the workers in the yards and one standard
of efficiency. Jurgis was told that they also fixed the price they would pay for beef on the
hoof and the price of all dressed meat in the country; but that was something he did not understand
or care about.

The only one who was not afraid of a cut was Marija, who congratulated herself, somewhat naively,
that there had been one in her place only a short time before she came. Marija was getting
to be a skilled beef-trimmer, and was mounting to the heights again. During the summer and
fall Jurgis and Ona managed to pay her back the last penny they owed her, and so she began
to have a bank account. Tamoszius had a bank account also, and they ran a race, and began to
figure upon household expenses once more.

The possession of vast wealth entails cares and responsibilities, however, as poor Marija found
out. She had taken the advice of a friend and invested her savings in a bank on Ashland Avenue.
Of course she knew nothing about it, except that it was big and imposing--what possible chance
has a poor foreign working girl to understand the banking business, as it is conducted in this
land of frenzied finance? So Marija lived in a continual dread lest something should happen
to her bank, and would go out of her way mornings to make sure that it was still there. Her
principal thought was of fire, for she had deposited her money in bills, and was afraid that
if they were burned up the bank would not give her any others. Jurgis made fun of her for this,
for he was a man and was proud of his superior knowledge, telling her that the bank had fireproof
vaults, and all its millions of dollars hidden safely away in them.

However, one morning Marija took her usual detour, and, to her horror and dismay, saw a crowd
of people in front of the bank, filling the avenue solid for half a block. All the blood went
out of her face for terror. She broke into a run, shouting to the people to ask what was the
matter, but not stopping to hear what they answered, till she had come to where the throng
was so dense that she could no longer advance. There was a "run on the bank," they told her
then, but she did not know what that was, and turned from one person to another, trying in
an agony of fear to make out what they meant. Had something gone wrong with the bank? Nobody
was sure, but they thought so. Couldn't she get her money? There was no telling; the people
were afraid not, and they were all trying to get it. It was too early yet to tell anything--the
bank would not open for nearly three hours. So in a frenzy of despair Marija began to claw
her way toward the doors of this building, through a throng of men, women, and children, all
as excited as herself. It was a scene of wild confusion, women shrieking and wringing their
hands and fainting, and men fighting and trampling down everything in their way. In the midst
of the melee Marija recollected that she did not have her bankbook, and could not get her money
anyway, so she fought her way out and started on a run for home. This was fortunate for her,
for a few minutes later the police reserves arrived.

In half an hour Marija was back, Teta Elzbieta with her, both of them breathless with running
and sick with fear. The crowd was now formed in a line, extending for several blocks, with
half a hundred policemen keeping guard, and so there was nothing for them to do but to take
their places at the end of it. At nine o'clock the bank opened and began to pay the waiting
throng; but then, what good did that do Marija, who saw three thousand people before her--enough
to take out the last penny of a dozen banks?

To make matters worse a drizzling rain came up, and soaked them to the skin; yet all the morning
they stood there, creeping slowly toward the goal--all the afternoon they stood there, heartsick,
seeing that the hour of closing was coming, and that they were going to be left out. Marija
made up her mind that, come what might, she would stay there and keep her place; but as nearly
all did the same, all through the long, cold night, she got very little closer to the bank
for that. Toward evening Jurgis came; he had heard the story from the children, and he brought
some food and dry wraps, which made it a little easier.

The next morning, before daybreak, came a bigger crowd than ever, and more policemen from downtown.
Marija held on like grim death, and toward afternoon she got into the bank and got her money--all
in big silver dollars, a handkerchief full. When she had once got her hands on them her fear
vanished, and she wanted to put them back again; but the man at the window was savage, and
said that the bank would receive no more deposits from those who had taken part in the run.
So Marija was forced to take her dollars home with her, watching to right and left, expecting
every instant that some one would try to rob her; and when she got home she was not much better
off. Until she could find another bank there was nothing to do but sew them up in her clothes,
and so Marija went about for a week or more, loaded down with bullion, and afraid to cross
the street in front of the house, because Jurgis told her she would sink out of sight in the
mud. Weighted this way she made her way to the yards, again in fear, this time to see if she
had lost her place; but fortunately about ten per cent of the working people of Packingtown
had been depositors in that bank, and it was not convenient to discharge that many at once.
The cause of the panic had been the attempt of a policeman to arrest a drunken man in a saloon
next door, which had drawn a crowd at the hour the people were on their way to work, and so
started the "run."

About this time Jurgis and Ona also began a bank account. Besides having paid Jonas and Marija,
they had almost paid for their furniture, and could have that little sum to count on. So long
as each of them could bring home nine or ten dollars a week, they were able to get along finely.
Also election day came round again, and Jurgis made half a week's wages out of that, all net
profit. It was a very close election that year, and the echoes of the battle reached even to
Packingtown. The two rival sets of grafters hired halls and set off fireworks and made speeches,
to try to get the people interested in the matter. Although Jurgis did not understand it all,
he knew enough by this time to realize that it was not supposed to be right to sell your vote.
However, as every one did it, and his refusal to join would not have made the slightest difference
in the results, the idea of refusing would have seemed absurd, had it ever come into his head.

Now chill winds and shortening days began to warn them that the winter was coming again. It
seemed as if the respite had been too short--they had not had time enough to get ready for
it; but still it came, inexorably, and the hunted look began to come back into the eyes of
little Stanislovas. The prospect struck fear to the heart of Jurgis also, for he knew that
Ona was not fit to face the cold and the snowdrifts this year. And suppose that some day when
a blizzard struck them and the cars were not running, Ona should have to give up, and should
come the next day to find that her place had been given to some one who lived nearer and could
be depended on?

It was the week before Christmas that the first storm came, and then the soul of Jurgis rose
up within him like a sleeping lion. There were four days that the Ashland Avenue cars were
stalled, and in those days, for the first time in his life, Jurgis knew what it was to be really
opposed. He had faced difficulties before, but they had been child's play; now there was a
death struggle, and all the furies were unchained within him. The first morning they set out
two hours before dawn, Ona wrapped all in blankets and tossed upon his shoulder like a sack
of meal, and the little boy, bundled nearly out of sight, hanging by his coat-tails. There
was a raging blast beating in his face, and the thermometer stood below zero; the snow was
never short of his knees, and in some of the drifts it was nearly up to his armpits. It would
catch his feet and try to trip him; it would build itself into a wall before him to beat him
back; and he would fling himself into it, plunging like a wounded buffalo, puffing and snorting
in rage. So foot by foot he drove his way, and when at last he came to Durham's he was staggering
and almost blind, and leaned against a pillar, gasping, and thanking God that the cattle came
late to the killing beds that day. In the evening the same thing had to be done again; and
because Jurgis could not tell what hour of the night he would get off, he got a saloon-keeper
to let Ona sit and wait for him in a corner. Once it was eleven o'clock at night, and black
as the pit, but still they got home.

That blizzard knocked many a man out, for the crowd outside begging for work was never greater,
and the packers would not wait long for any one. When it was over, the soul of Jurgis was a
song, for he had met the enemy and conquered, and felt himself the master of his fate.--So
it might be with some monarch of the forest that has vanquished his foes in fair fight, and
then falls into some cowardly trap in the night-time.

A time of peril on the killing beds was when a steer broke loose. Sometimes, in the haste of
speeding-up, they would dump one of the animals out on the floor before it was fully stunned,
and it would get upon its feet and run amuck. Then there would be a yell of warning--the men
would drop everything and dash for the nearest pillar, slipping here and there on the floor,
and tumbling over each other. This was bad enough in the summer, when a man could see; in wintertime
it was enough to make your hair stand up, for the room would be so full of steam that you could
not make anything out five feet in front of you. To be sure, the steer was generally blind
and frantic, and not especially bent on hurting any one; but think of the chances of running
upon a knife, while nearly every man had one in his hand! And then, to cap the climax, the
floor boss would come rushing up with a rifle and begin blazing away!

It was in one of these melees that Jurgis fell into his trap. That is the only word to describe
it; it was so cruel, and so utterly not to be foreseen. At first he hardly noticed it, it was
such a slight accident--simply that in leaping out of the way he turned his ankle. There was
a twinge of pain, but Jurgis was used to pain, and did not coddle himself. When he came to
walk home, however, he realized that it was hurting him a great deal; and in the morning his
ankle was swollen out nearly double its size, and he could not get his foot into his shoe.
Still, even then, he did nothing more than swear a little, and wrapped his foot in old rags,
and hobbled out to take the car. It chanced to be a rush day at Durham's, and all the long
morning he limped about with his aching foot; by noontime the pain was so great that it made
him faint, and after a couple of hours in the afternoon he was fairly beaten, and had to tell
the boss. They sent for the company doctor, and he examined the foot and told Jurgis to go
home to bed, adding that he had probably laid himself up for months by his folly. The injury
was not one that Durham and Company could be held responsible for, and so that was all there
was to it, so far as the doctor was concerned.

Jurgis got home somehow, scarcely able to see for the pain, and with an awful terror in his
soul, Elzbieta helped him into bed and bandaged his injured foot with cold water and tried
hard not to let him see her dismay; when the rest came home at night she met them outside and
told them, and they, too, put on a cheerful face, saying it would only be for a week or two,
and that they would pull him through.

When they had gotten him to sleep, however, they sat by the kitchen fire and talked it over
in frightened whispers. They were in for a siege, that was plainly to be seen. Jurgis had only
about sixty dollars in the bank, and the slack season was upon them. Both Jonas and Marija
might soon be earning no more than enough to pay their board, and besides that there were only
the wages of Ona and the pittance of the little boy. There was the rent to pay, and still some
on the furniture; there was the insurance just due, and every month there was sack after sack
of coal. It was January, midwinter, an awful time to have to face privation. Deep snows would
come again, and who would carry Ona to her work now? She might lose her place--she was almost
certain to lose it. And then little Stanislovas began to whimper--who would take care of him?

It was dreadful that an accident of this sort, that no man can help, should have meant such
suffering. The bitterness of it was the daily food and drink of Jurgis. It was of no use for
them to try to deceive him; he knew as much about the situation as they did, and he knew that
the family might literally starve to death. The worry of it fairly ate him up--he began to
look haggard the first two or three days of it. In truth, it was almost maddening for a strong
man like him, a fighter, to have to lie there helpless on his back. It was for all the world
the old story of Prometheus bound. As Jurgis lay on his bed, hour after hour there came to
him emotions that he had never known before. Before this he had met life with a welcome--it
had its trials, but none that a man could not face. But now, in the nighttime, when he lay
tossing about, there would come stalking into his chamber a grisly phantom, the sight of which
made his flesh curl and his hair to bristle up. It was like seeing the world fall away from
underneath his feet; like plunging down into a bottomless abyss into yawning caverns of despair.
It might be true, then, after all, what others had told him about life, that the best powers
of a man might not be equal to it! It might be true that, strive as he would, toil as he would,
he might fail, and go down and be destroyed! The thought of this was like an icy hand at his
heart; the thought that here, in this ghastly home of all horror, he and all those who were
dear to him might lie and perish of starvation and cold, and there would be no ear to hear
their cry, no hand to help them! It was true, it was true,--that here in this huge city, with
its stores of heaped-up wealth, human creatures might be hunted down and destroyed by the wild-beast
powers of nature, just as truly as ever they were in the days of the cave men!

Ona was now making about thirty dollars a month, and Stanislovas about thirteen. To add to
this there was the board of Jonas and Marija, about forty-five dollars. Deducting from this
the rent, interest, and installments on the furniture, they had left sixty dollars, and deducting
the coal, they had fifty. They did without everything that human beings could do without; they
went in old and ragged clothing, that left them at the mercy of the cold, and when the children's
shoes wore out, they tied them up with string. Half invalid as she was, Ona would do herself
harm by walking in the rain and cold when she ought to have ridden; they bought literally nothing
but food--and still they could not keep alive on fifty dollars a month. They might have done
it, if only they could have gotten pure food, and at fair prices; or if only they had known
what to get--if they had not been so pitifully ignorant! But they had come to a new country,
where everything was different, including the food. They had always been accustomed to eat
a great deal of smoked sausage, and how could they know that what they bought in America was
not the same--that its color was made by chemicals, and its smoky flavor by more chemicals,
and that it was full of "potato flour" besides? Potato flour is the waste of potato after the
starch and alcohol have been extracted; it has no more food value than so much wood, and as
its use as a food adulterant is a penal offense in Europe, thousands of tons of it are shipped
to America every year. It was amazing what quantities of food such as this were needed every
day, by eleven hungry persons. A dollar sixty-five a day was simply not enough to feed them,
and there was no use trying; and so each week they made an inroad upon the pitiful little bank
account that Ona had begun. Because the account was in her name, it was possible for her to
keep this a secret from her husband, and to keep the heartsickness of it for her own.

It would have been better if Jurgis had been really ill; if he had not been able to think.
For he had no resources such as most invalids have; all he could do was to lie there and toss
about from side to side. Now and then he would break into cursing, regardless of everything;
and now and then his impatience would get the better of him, and he would try to get up, and
poor Teta Elzbieta would have to plead with him in a frenzy. Elzbieta was all alone with him
the greater part of the time. She would sit and smooth his forehead by the hour, and talk to
him and try to make him forget. Sometimes it would be too cold for the children to go to school,
and they would have to play in the kitchen, where Jurgis was, because it was the only room
that was half warm. These were dreadful times, for Jurgis would get as cross as any bear; he
was scarcely to be blamed, for he had enough to worry him, and it was hard when he was trying
to take a nap to be kept awake by noisy and peevish children.

Elzbieta's only resource in those times was little Antanas; indeed, it would be hard to say
how they could have gotten along at all if it had not been for little Antanas. It was the one
consolation of Jurgis' long imprisonment that now he had time to look at his baby. Teta Elzbieta
would put the clothesbasket in which the baby slept alongside of his mattress, and Jurgis would
lie upon one elbow and watch him by the hour, imagining things. Then little Antanas would open
his eyes--he was beginning to take notice of things now; and he would smile--how he would smile!
So Jurgis would begin to forget and be happy because he was in a world where there was a thing
so beautiful as the smile of little Antanas, and because such a world could not but be good
at the heart of it. He looked more like his father every hour, Elzbieta would say, and said
it many times a day, because she saw that it pleased Jurgis; the poor little terror-stricken
woman was planning all day and all night to soothe the prisoned giant who was intrusted to
her care. Jurgis, who knew nothing about the agelong and everlasting hypocrisy of woman, would
take the bait and grin with delight; and then he would hold his finger in front of little Antanas'
eyes, and move it this way and that, and laugh with glee to see the baby follow it. There is
no pet quite so fascinating as a baby; he would look into Jurgis' face with such uncanny seriousness,
and Jurgis would start and cry: "Palauk! Look, Muma, he knows his papa! He does, he does! Tu
mano szirdele, the little rascal!"

Chapter 12

For three weeks after his injury Jurgis never got up from bed. It was a very obstinate sprain;
the swelling would not go down, and the pain still continued. At the end of that time, however,
he could contain himself no longer, and began trying to walk a little every day, laboring to
persuade himself that he was better. No arguments could stop him, and three or four days later
he declared that he was going back to work. He limped to the cars and got to Brown's, where
he found that the boss had kept his place--that is, was willing to turn out into the snow the
poor devil he had hired in the meantime. Every now and then the pain would force Jurgis to
stop work, but he stuck it out till nearly an hour before closing. Then he was forced to acknowledge
that he could not go on without fainting; it almost broke his heart to do it, and he stood
leaning against a pillar and weeping like a child. Two of the men had to help him to the car,
and when he got out he had to sit down and wait in the snow till some one came along.

So they put him to bed again, and sent for the doctor, as they ought to have done in the beginning.
It transpired that he had twisted a tendon out of place, and could never have gotten well without
attention. Then he gripped the sides of the bed, and shut his teeth together, and turned white
with agony, while the doctor pulled and wrenched away at his swollen ankle. When finally the
doctor left, he told him that he would have to lie quiet for two months, and that if he went
to work before that time he might lame himself for life.

Three days later there came another heavy snowstorm, and Jonas and Marija and Ona and little
Stanislovas all set out together, an hour before daybreak, to try to get to the yards. About
noon the last two came back, the boy screaming with pain. His fingers were all frosted, it
seemed. They had had to give up trying to get to the yards, and had nearly perished in a drift.
All that they knew how to do was to hold the frozen fingers near the fire, and so little Stanislovas
spent most of the day dancing about in horrible agony, till Jurgis flew into a passion of nervous
rage and swore like a madman, declaring that he would kill him if he did not stop. All that
day and night the family was half-crazed with fear that Ona and the boy had lost their places;
and in the morning they set out earlier than ever, after the little fellow had been beaten
with a stick by Jurgis. There could be no trifling in a case like this, it was a matter of
life and death; little Stanislovas could not be expected to realize that he might a great deal
better freeze in the snowdrift than lose his job at the lard machine. Ona was quite certain
that she would find her place gone, and was all unnerved when she finally got to Brown's, and
found that the forelady herself had failed to come, and was therefore compelled to be lenient.

One of the consequences of this episode was that the first joints of three of the little boy's
fingers were permanently disabled, and another that thereafter he always had to be beaten before
he set out to work, whenever there was fresh snow on the ground. Jurgis was called upon to
do the beating, and as it hurt his foot he did it with a vengeance; but it did not tend to
add to the sweetness of his temper. They say that the best dog will turn cross if he be kept
chained all the time, and it was the same with the man; he had not a thing to do all day but
lie and curse his fate, and the time came when he wanted to curse everything.

This was never for very long, however, for when Ona began to cry, Jurgis could not stay angry.
The poor fellow looked like a homeless ghost, with his cheeks sunken in and his long black
hair straggling into his eyes; he was too discouraged to cut it, or to think about his appearance.
His muscles were wasting away, and what were left were soft and flabby. He had no appetite,
and they could not afford to tempt him with delicacies. It was better, he said, that he should
not eat, it was a saving. About the end of March he had got hold of Ona's bankbook, and learned
that there was only three dollars left to them in the world.

But perhaps the worst of the consequences of this long siege was that they lost another member
of their family; Brother Jonas disappeared. One Saturday night he did not come home, and thereafter
all their efforts to get trace of him were futile. It was said by the boss at Durham's that
he had gotten his week's money and left there. That might not be true, of course, for sometimes
they would say that when a man had been killed; it was the easiest way out of it for all concerned.
When, for instance, a man had fallen into one of the rendering tanks and had been made into
pure leaf lard and peerless fertilizer, there was no use letting the fact out and making his
family unhappy. More probable, however, was the theory that Jonas had deserted them, and gone
on the road, seeking happiness. He had been discontented for a long time, and not without some
cause. He paid good board, and was yet obliged to live in a family where nobody had enough
to eat. And Marija would keep giving them all her money, and of course he could not but feel
that he was called upon to do the same. Then there were crying brats, and all sorts of misery;
a man would have had to be a good deal of a hero to stand it all without grumbling, and Jonas
was not in the least a hero--he was simply a weatherbeaten old fellow who liked to have a good
supper and sit in the corner by the fire and smoke his pipe in peace before he went to bed.
Here there was not room by the fire, and through the winter the kitchen had seldom been warm
enough for comfort. So, with the springtime, what was more likely than that the wild idea of
escaping had come to him? Two years he had been yoked like a horse to a half-ton truck in Durham's
dark cellars, with never a rest, save on Sundays and four holidays in the year, and with never
a word of thanks--only kicks and blows and curses, such as no decent dog would have stood.
And now the winter was over, and the spring winds were blowing--and with a day's walk a man
might put the smoke of Packingtown behind him forever, and be where the grass was green and
the flowers all the colors of the rainbow!

But now the income of the family was cut down more than one-third, and the food demand was
cut only one-eleventh, so that they were worse off than ever. Also they were borrowing money
from Marija, and eating up her bank account, and spoiling once again her hopes of marriage
and happiness. And they were even going into debt to Tamoszius Kuszleika and letting him impoverish
himself. Poor Tamoszius was a man without any relatives, and with a wonderful talent besides,
and he ought to have made money and prospered; but he had fallen in love, and so given hostages
to fortune, and was doomed to be dragged down too.

So it was finally decided that two more of the children would have to leave school. Next to
Stanislovas, who was now fifteen, there was a girl, little Kotrina, who was two years younger,
and then two boys, Vilimas, who was eleven, and Nikalojus, who was ten. Both of these last
were bright boys, and there was no reason why their family should starve when tens of thousands
of children no older were earning their own livings. So one morning they were given a quarter
apiece and a roll with a sausage in it, and, with their minds top-heavy with good advice, were
sent out to make their way to the city and learn to sell newspapers. They came back late at
night in tears, having walked for the five or six miles to report that a man had offered to
take them to a place where they sold newspapers, and had taken their money and gone into a
store to get them, and nevermore been seen. So they both received a whipping, and the next
morning set out again. This time they found the newspaper place, and procured their stock;
and after wandering about till nearly noontime, saying "Paper?" to every one they saw, they
had all their stock taken away and received a thrashing besides from a big newsman upon whose
territory they had trespassed. Fortunately, however, they had already sold some papers, and
came back with nearly as much as they started with.

After a week of mishaps such as these, the two little fellows began to learn the ways of the
trade--the names of the different papers, and how many of each to get, and what sort of people
to offer them to, and where to go and where to stay away from. After this, leaving home at
four o'clock in the morning, and running about the streets, first with morning papers and then
with evening, they might come home late at night with twenty or thirty cents apiece--possibly
as much as forty cents. From this they had to deduct their carfare, since the distance was
so great; but after a while they made friends, and learned still more, and then they would
save their carfare. They would get on a car when the conductor was not looking, and hide in
the crowd; and three times out of four he would not ask for their fares, either not seeing
them, or thinking they had already paid; or if he did ask, they would hunt through their pockets,
and then begin to cry, and either have their fares paid by some kind old lady, or else try
the trick again on a new car. All this was fair play, they felt. Whose fault was it that at
the hours when workingmen were going to their work and back, the cars were so crowded that
the conductors could not collect all the fares? And besides, the companies were thieves, people
said--had stolen all their franchises with the help of scoundrelly politicians!

Now that the winter was by, and there was no more danger of snow, and no more coal to buy,
and another room warm enough to put the children into when they cried, and enough money to
get along from week to week with, Jurgis was less terrible than he had been. A man can get
used to anything in the course of time, and Jurgis had gotten used to lying about the house.
Ona saw this, and was very careful not to destroy his peace of mind, by letting him know how
very much pain she was suffering. It was now the time of the spring rains, and Ona had often
to ride to her work, in spite of the expense; she was getting paler every day, and sometimes,
in spite of her good resolutions, it pained her that Jurgis did not notice it. She wondered
if he cared for her as much as ever, if all this misery was not wearing out his love. She had
to be away from him all the time, and bear her own troubles while he was bearing his; and then,
when she came home, she was so worn out; and whenever they talked they had only their worries
to talk of--truly it was hard, in such a life, to keep any sentiment alive. The woe of this
would flame up in Ona sometimes--at night she would suddenly clasp her big husband in her arms
and break into passionate weeping, demanding to know if he really loved her. Poor Jurgis, who
had in truth grown more matter-of-fact, under the endless pressure of penury, would not know
what to make of these things, and could only try to recollect when he had last been cross;
and so Ona would have to forgive him and sob herself to sleep.

The latter part of April Jurgis went to see the doctor, and was given a bandage to lace about
his ankle, and told that he might go back to work. It needed more than the permission of the
doctor, however, for when he showed up on the killing floor of Brown's, he was told by the
foreman that it had not been possible to keep his job for him. Jurgis knew that this meant
simply that the foreman had found some one else to do the work as well and did not want to
bother to make a change. He stood in the doorway, looking mournfully on, seeing his friends
and companions at work, and feeling like an outcast. Then he went out and took his place with
the mob of the unemployed.

This time, however, Jurgis did not have the same fine confidence, nor the same reason for it.
He was no longer the finest-looking man in the throng, and the bosses no longer made for him;
he was thin and haggard, and his clothes were seedy, and he looked miserable. And there were
hundreds who looked and felt just like him, and who had been wandering about Packingtown for
months begging for work. This was a critical time in Jurgis' life, and if he had been a weaker
man he would have gone the way the rest did. Those out-of-work wretches would stand about the
packing houses every morning till the police drove them away, and then they would scatter among
the saloons. Very few of them had the nerve to face the rebuffs that they would encounter by
trying to get into the buildings to interview the bosses; if they did not get a chance in the
morning, there would be nothing to do but hang about the saloons the rest of the day and night.
Jurgis was saved from all this--partly, to be sure, because it was pleasant weather, and there
was no need to be indoors; but mainly because he carried with him always the pitiful little
face of his wife. He must get work, he told himself, fighting the battle with despair every
hour of the day. He must get work! He must have a place again and some money saved up, before
the next winter came.

But there was no work for him. He sought out all the members of his union--Jurgis had stuck
to the union through all this--and begged them to speak a word for him. He went to every one
he knew, asking for a chance, there or anywhere. He wandered all day through the buildings;
and in a week or two, when he had been all over the yards, and into every room to which he
had access, and learned that there was not a job anywhere, he persuaded himself that there
might have been a change in the places he had first visited, and began the round all over;
till finally the watchmen and the "spotters" of the companies came to know him by sight and
to order him out with threats. Then there was nothing more for him to do but go with the crowd
in the morning, and keep in the front row and look eager, and when he failed, go back home,
and play with little Kotrina and the baby.

The peculiar bitterness of all this was that Jurgis saw so plainly the meaning of it. In the
beginning he had been fresh and strong, and he had gotten a job the first day; but now he was
second-hand, a damaged article, so to speak, and they did not want him. They had got the best
of him--they had worn him out, with their speeding-up and their carelessness, and now they
had thrown him away! And Jurgis would make the acquaintance of others of these unemployed men
and find that they had all had the same experience. There were some, of course, who had wandered
in from other places, who had been ground up in other mills; there were others who were out
from their own fault--some, for instance, who had not been able to stand the awful grind without
drink. The vast majority, however, were simply the worn-out parts of the great merciless packing
machine; they had toiled there, and kept up with the pace, some of them for ten or twenty years,
until finally the time had come when they could not keep up with it any more. Some had been
frankly told that they were too old, that a sprier man was needed; others had given occasion,
by some act of carelessness or incompetence; with most, however, the occasion had been the
same as with Jurgis. They had been overworked and underfed so long, and finally some disease
had laid them on their backs; or they had cut themselves, and had blood poisoning, or met with
some other accident. When a man came back after that, he would get his place back only by the
courtesy of the boss. To this there was no exception, save when the accident was one for which
the firm was liable; in that case they would send a slippery lawyer to see him, first to try
to get him to sign away his claims, but if he was too smart for that, to promise him that he
and his should always be provided with work. This promise they would keep, strictly and to
the letter--for two years. Two years was the "statute of limitations," and after that the victim
could not sue.

What happened to a man after any of these things, all depended upon the circumstances. If he
were of the highly skilled workers, he would probably have enough saved up to tide him over.
The best paid men, the "splitters," made fifty cents an hour, which would be five or six dollars
a day in the rush seasons, and one or two in the dullest. A man could live and save on that;
but then there were only half a dozen splitters in each place, and one of them that Jurgis
knew had a family of twenty-two children, all hoping to grow up to be splitters like their
father. For an unskilled man, who made ten dollars a week in the rush seasons and five in the
dull, it all depended upon his age and the number he had dependent upon him. An unmarried man
could save, if he did not drink, and if he was absolutely selfish--that is, if he paid no heed
to the demands of his old parents, or of his little brothers and sisters, or of any other relatives
he might have, as well as of the members of his union, and his chums, and the people who might
be starving to death next door.

Chapter 13

During this time that Jurgis was looking for work occurred the death of little Kristoforas,
one of the children of Teta Elzbieta. Both Kristoforas and his brother, Juozapas, were cripples,
the latter having lost one leg by having it run over, and Kristoforas having congenital dislocation
of the hip, which made it impossible for him ever to walk. He was the last of Teta Elzbieta's
children, and perhaps he had been intended by nature to let her know that she had had enough.
At any rate he was wretchedly sick and undersized; he had the rickets, and though he was over
three years old, he was no bigger than an ordinary child of one. All day long he would crawl
around the floor in a filthy little dress, whining and fretting; because the floor was full
of drafts he was always catching cold, and snuffling because his nose ran. This made him a
nuisance, and a source of endless trouble in the family. For his mother, with unnatural perversity,
loved him best of all her children, and made a perpetual fuss over him--would let him do anything
undisturbed, and would burst into tears when his fretting drove Jurgis wild.

And now he died. Perhaps it was the smoked sausage he had eaten that morning--which may have
been made out of some of the tubercular pork that was condemned as unfit for export. At any
rate, an hour after eating it, the child had begun to cry with pain, and in another hour he
was rolling about on the floor in convulsions. Little Kotrina, who was all alone with him,
ran out screaming for help, and after a while a doctor came, but not until Kristoforas had
howled his last howl. No one was really sorry about this except poor Elzbieta, who was inconsolable.
Jurgis announced that so far as he was concerned the child would have to be buried by the city,
since they had no money for a funeral; and at this the poor woman almost went out of her senses,
wringing her hands and screaming with grief and despair. Her child to be buried in a pauper's
grave! And her stepdaughter to stand by and hear it said without protesting! It was enough
to make Ona's father rise up out of his grave to rebuke her! If it had come to this, they might
as well give up at once, and be buried all of them together! . . . In the end Marija said that
she would help with ten dollars; and Jurgis being still obdurate, Elzbieta went in tears and
begged the money from the neighbors, and so little Kristoforas had a mass and a hearse with
white plumes on it, and a tiny plot in a graveyard with a wooden cross to mark the place. The
poor mother was not the same for months after that; the mere sight of the floor where little
Kristoforas had crawled about would make her weep. He had never had a fair chance, poor little
fellow, she would say. He had been handicapped from his birth. If only she had heard about
it in time, so that she might have had that great doctor to cure him of his lameness! . . .
Some time ago, Elzbieta was told, a Chicago billionaire had paid a fortune to bring a great
European surgeon over to cure his little daughter of the same disease from which Kristoforas
had suffered. And because this surgeon had to have bodies to demonstrate upon, he announced
that he would treat the children of the poor, a piece of magnanimity over which the papers
became quite eloquent. Elzbieta, alas, did not read the papers, and no one had told her; but
perhaps it was as well, for just then they would not have had the carfare to spare to go every
day to wait upon the surgeon, nor for that matter anybody with the time to take the child.

All this while that he was seeking for work, there was a dark shadow hanging over Jurgis; as
if a savage beast were lurking somewhere in the pathway of his life, and he knew it, and yet
could not help approaching the place. There are all stages of being out of work in Packingtown,
and he faced in dread the prospect of reaching the lowest. There is a place that waits for
the lowest man--the fertilizer plant!

The men would talk about it in awe-stricken whispers. Not more than one in ten had ever really
tried it; the other nine had contented themselves with hearsay evidence and a peep through
the door. There were some things worse than even starving to death. They would ask Jurgis if
he had worked there yet, and if he meant to; and Jurgis would debate the matter with himself.
As poor as they were, and making all the sacrifices that they were, would he dare to refuse
any sort of work that was offered to him, be it as horrible as ever it could? Would he dare
to go home and eat bread that had been earned by Ona, weak and complaining as she was, knowing
that he had been given a chance, and had not had the nerve to take it?--And yet he might argue
that way with himself all day, and one glimpse into the fertilizer works would send him away
again shuddering. He was a man, and he would do his duty; he went and made application--but
surely he was not also required to hope for success!

The fertilizer works of Durham's lay away from the rest of the plant. Few visitors ever saw
them, and the few who did would come out looking like Dante, of whom the peasants declared
that he had been into hell. To this part of the yards came all the "tankage" and the waste
products of all sorts; here they dried out the bones,--and in suffocating cellars where the
daylight never came you might see men and women and children bending over whirling machines
and sawing bits of bone into all sorts of shapes, breathing their lungs full of the fine dust,
and doomed to die, every one of them, within a certain definite time. Here they made the blood
into albumen, and made other foul-smelling things into things still more foul-smelling. In
the corridors and caverns where it was done you might lose yourself as in the great caves of
Kentucky. In the dust and the steam the electric lights would shine like far-off twinkling
stars--red and blue-green and purple stars, according to the color of the mist and the brew
from which it came. For the odors of these ghastly charnel houses there may be words in Lithuanian,
but there are none in English. The person entering would have to summon his courage as for
a cold-water plunge. He would go in like a man swimming under water; he would put his handkerchief
over his face, and begin to cough and choke; and then, if he were still obstinate, he would
find his head beginning to ring, and the veins in his forehead to throb, until finally he would
be assailed by an overpowering blast of ammonia fumes, and would turn and run for his life,
and come out half-dazed.

On top of this were the rooms where they dried the "tankage," the mass of brown stringy stuff
that was left after the waste portions of the carcasses had had the lard and tallow dried out
of them. This dried material they would then grind to a fine powder, and after they had mixed
it up well with a mysterious but inoffensive brown rock which they brought in and ground up
by the hundreds of carloads for that purpose, the substance was ready to be put into bags and
sent out to the world as any one of a hundred different brands of standard bone phosphate.
And then the farmer in Maine or California or Texas would buy this, at say twenty-five dollars
a ton, and plant it with his corn; and for several days after the operation the fields would
have a strong odor, and the farmer and his wagon and the very horses that had hauled it would
all have it too. In Packingtown the fertilizer is pure, instead of being a flavoring, and instead
of a ton or so spread out on several acres under the open sky, there are hundreds and thousands
of tons of it in one building, heaped here and there in haystack piles, covering the floor
several inches deep, and filling the air with a choking dust that becomes a blinding sandstorm
when the wind stirs.

It was to this building that Jurgis came daily, as if dragged by an unseen hand. The month
of May was an exceptionally cool one, and his secret prayers were granted; but early in June
there came a record-breaking hot spell, and after that there were men wanted in the fertilizer
mill.

The boss of the grinding room had come to know Jurgis by this time, and had marked him for
a likely man; and so when he came to the door about two o'clock this breathless hot day, he
felt a sudden spasm of pain shoot through him--the boss beckoned to him! In ten minutes more
Jurgis had pulled off his coat and overshirt, and set his teeth together and gone to work.
Here was one more difficulty for him to meet and conquer!

His labor took him about one minute to learn. Before him was one of the vents of the mill in
which the fertilizer was being ground--rushing forth in a great brown river, with a spray of
the finest dust flung forth in clouds. Jurgis was given a shovel, and along with half a dozen
others it was his task to shovel this fertilizer into carts. That others were at work he knew
by the sound, and by the fact that he sometimes collided with them; otherwise they might as
well not have been there, for in the blinding dust storm a man could not see six feet in front
of his face. When he had filled one cart he had to grope around him until another came, and
if there was none on hand he continued to grope till one arrived. In five minutes he was, of
course, a mass of fertilizer from head to feet; they gave him a sponge to tie over his mouth,
so that he could breathe, but the sponge did not prevent his lips and eyelids from caking up
with it and his ears from filling solid. He looked like a brown ghost at twilight--from hair
to shoes he became the color of the building and of everything in it, and for that matter a
hundred yards outside it. The building had to be left open, and when the wind blew Durham and
Company lost a great deal of fertilizer.

Working in his shirt sleeves, and with the thermometer at over a hundred, the phosphates soaked
in through every pore of Jurgis' skin, and in five minutes he had a headache, and in fifteen
was almost dazed. The blood was pounding in his brain like an engine's throbbing; there was
a frightful pain in the top of his skull, and he could hardly control his hands. Still, with
the memory of his four months' siege behind him, he fought on, in a frenzy of determination;
and half an hour later he began to vomit--he vomited until it seemed as if his inwards must
be torn into shreds. A man could get used to the fertilizer mill, the boss had said, if he
would make up his mind to it; but Jurgis now began to see that it was a question of making
up his stomach.

At the end of that day of horror, he could scarcely stand. He had to catch himself now and
then, and lean against a building and get his bearings. Most of the men, when they came out,
made straight for a saloon--they seemed to place fertilizer and rattlesnake poison in one class.
But Jurgis was too ill to think of drinking--he could only make his way to the street and stagger
on to a car. He had a sense of humor, and later on, when he became an old hand, he used to
think it fun to board a streetcar and see what happened. Now, however, he was too ill to notice
it--how the people in the car began to gasp and sputter, to put their handkerchiefs to their
noses, and transfix him with furious glances. Jurgis only knew that a man in front of him immediately
got up and gave him a seat; and that half a minute later the two people on each side of him
got up; and that in a full minute the crowded car was nearly empty--those passengers who could
not get room on the platform having gotten out to walk.

Of course Jurgis had made his home a miniature fertilizer mill a minute after entering. The
stuff was half an inch deep in his skin--his whole system was full of it, and it would have
taken a week not merely of scrubbing, but of vigorous exercise, to get it out of him. As it
was, he could be compared with nothing known to men, save that newest discovery of the savants,
a substance which emits energy for an unlimited time, without being itself in the least diminished
in power. He smelled so that he made all the food at the table taste, and set the whole family
to vomiting; for himself it was three days before he could keep anything upon his stomach--he
might wash his hands, and use a knife and fork, but were not his mouth and throat filled with
the poison?

And still Jurgis stuck it out! In spite of splitting headaches he would stagger down to the
plant and take up his stand once more, and begin to shovel in the blinding clouds of dust.
And so at the end of the week he was a fertilizer man for life--he was able to eat again, and
though his head never stopped aching, it ceased to be so bad that he could not work.

So there passed another summer. It was a summer of prosperity, all over the country, and the
country ate generously of packing house products, and there was plenty of work for all the
family, in spite of the packers' efforts to keep a superfluity of labor. They were again able
to pay their debts and to begin to save a little sum; but there were one or two sacrifices
they considered too heavy to be made for long--it was too bad that the boys should have to
sell papers at their age. It was utterly useless to caution them and plead with them; quite
without knowing it, they were taking on the tone of their new environment. They were learning
to swear in voluble English; they were learning to pick up cigar stumps and smoke them, to
pass hours of their time gambling with pennies and dice and cigarette cards; they were learning
the location of all the houses of prostitution on the "Levee," and the names of the "madames"
who kept them, and the days when they gave their state banquets, which the police captains
and the big politicians all attended. If a visiting "country customer" were to ask them, they
could show him which was "Hinkydink's" famous saloon, and could even point out to him by name
the different gamblers and thugs and "hold-up men" who made the place their headquarters. And
worse yet, the boys were getting out of the habit of coming home at night. What was the use,
they would ask, of wasting time and energy and a possible carfare riding out to the stockyards
every night when the weather was pleasant and they could crawl under a truck or into an empty
doorway and sleep exactly as well? So long as they brought home a half dollar for each day,
what mattered it when they brought it? But Jurgis declared that from this to ceasing to come
at all would not be a very long step, and so it was decided that Vilimas and Nikalojus should
return to school in the fall, and that instead Elzbieta should go out and get some work, her
place at home being taken by her younger daughter.

Little Kotrina was like most children of the poor, prematurely made old; she had to take care
of her little brother, who was a cripple, and also of the baby; she had to cook the meals and
wash the dishes and clean house, and have supper ready when the workers came home in the evening.
She was only thirteen, and small for her age, but she did all this without a murmur; and her
mother went out, and after trudging a couple of days about the yards, settled down as a servant
of a "sausage machine."

Elzbieta was used to working, but she found this change a hard one, for the reason that she
had to stand motionless upon her feet from seven o'clock in the morning till half-past twelve,
and again from one till half-past five. For the first few days it seemed to her that she could
not stand it--she suffered almost as much as Jurgis had from the fertilizer, and would come
out at sundown with her head fairly reeling. Besides this, she was working in one of the dark
holes, by electric light, and the dampness, too, was deadly--there were always puddles of water
on the floor, and a sickening odor of moist flesh in the room. The people who worked here followed
the ancient custom of nature, whereby the ptarmigan is the color of dead leaves in the fall
and of snow in the winter, and the chameleon, who is black when he lies upon a stump and turns
green when he moves to a leaf. The men and women who worked in this department were precisely
the color of the "fresh country sausage" they made.

The sausage-room was an interesting place to visit, for two or three minutes, and provided
that you did not look at the people; the machines were perhaps the most wonderful things in
the entire plant. Presumably sausages were once chopped and stuffed by hand, and if so it would
be interesting to know how many workers had been displaced by these inventions. On one side
of the room were the hoppers, into which men shoveled loads of meat and wheelbarrows full of
spices; in these great bowls were whirling knives that made two thousand revolutions a minute,
and when the meat was ground fine and adulterated with potato flour, and well mixed with water,
it was forced to the stuffing machines on the other side of the room. The latter were tended
by women; there was a sort of spout, like the nozzle of a hose, and one of the women would
take a long string of "casing" and put the end over the nozzle and then work the whole thing
on, as one works on the finger of a tight glove. This string would be twenty or thirty feet
long, but the woman would have it all on in a jiffy; and when she had several on, she would
press a lever, and a stream of sausage meat would be shot out, taking the casing with it as
it came. Thus one might stand and see appear, miraculously born from the machine, a wriggling
snake of sausage of incredible length. In front was a big pan which caught these creatures,
and two more women who seized them as fast as they appeared and twisted them into links. This
was for the uninitiated the most perplexing work of all; for all that the woman had to give
was a single turn of the wrist; and in some way she contrived to give it so that instead of
an endless chain of sausages, one after another, there grew under her hands a bunch of strings,
all dangling from a single center. It was quite like the feat of a prestidigitator--for the
woman worked so fast that the eye could literally not follow her, and there was only a mist
of motion, and tangle after tangle of sausages appearing. In the midst of the mist, however,
the visitor would suddenly notice the tense set face, with the two wrinkles graven in the forehead,
and the ghastly pallor of the cheeks; and then he would suddenly recollect that it was time
he was going on. The woman did not go on; she stayed right there--hour after hour, day after
day, year after year, twisting sausage links and racing with death. It was piecework, and she
was apt to have a family to keep alive; and stern and ruthless economic laws had arranged it
that she could only do this by working just as she did, with all her soul upon her work, and
with never an instant for a glance at the well-dressed ladies and gentlemen who came to stare
at her, as at some wild beast in a menagerie.

Chapter 14

With one member trimming beef in a cannery, and another working in a sausage factory, the family
had a first-hand knowledge of the great majority of Packingtown swindles. For it was the custom,
as they found, whenever meat was so spoiled that it could not be used for anything else, either
to can it or else to chop it up into sausage. With what had been told them by Jonas, who had
worked in the pickle rooms, they could now study the whole of the spoiled-meat industry on
the inside, and read a new and grim meaning into that old Packingtown jest--that they use everything
of the pig except the squeal.

Jonas had told them how the meat that was taken out of pickle would often be found sour, and
how they would rub it up with soda to take away the smell, and sell it to be eaten on free-lunch
counters; also of all the miracles of chemistry which they performed, giving to any sort of
meat, fresh or salted, whole or chopped, any color and any flavor and any odor they chose.
In the pickling of hams they had an ingenious apparatus, by which they saved time and increased
the capacity of the plant--a machine consisting of a hollow needle attached to a pump; by plunging
this needle into the meat and working with his foot, a man could fill a ham with pickle in
a few seconds. And yet, in spite of this, there would be hams found spoiled, some of them with
an odor so bad that a man could hardly bear to be in the room with them. To pump into these
the packers had a second and much stronger pickle which destroyed the odor--a process known
to the workers as "giving them thirty per cent." Also, after the hams had been smoked, there
would be found some that had gone to the bad. Formerly these had been sold as "Number Three
Grade," but later on some ingenious person had hit upon a new device, and now they would extract
the bone, about which the bad part generally lay, and insert in the hole a white-hot iron.
After this invention there was no longer Number One, Two, and Three Grade--there was only Number
One Grade. The packers were always originating such schemes--they had what they called "boneless
hams," which were all the odds and ends of pork stuffed into casings; and "California hams,"
which were the shoulders, with big knuckle joints, and nearly all the meat cut out; and fancy
"skinned hams," which were made of the oldest hogs, whose skins were so heavy and coarse that
no one would buy them--that is, until they had been cooked and chopped fine and labeled "head
cheese!"

It was only when the whole ham was spoiled that it came into the department of Elzbieta. Cut
up by the two-thousand-revolutions-a-minute flyers, and mixed with half a ton of other meat,
no odor that ever was in a ham could make any difference. There was never the least attention
paid to what was cut up for sausage; there would come all the way back from Europe old sausage
that had been rejected, and that was moldy and white--it would be dosed with borax and glycerine,
and dumped into the hoppers, and made over again for home consumption. There would be meat
that had tumbled out on the floor, in the dirt and sawdust, where the workers had tramped and
spit uncounted billions of consumption germs. There would be meat stored in great piles in
rooms; and the water from leaky roofs would drip over it, and thousands of rats would race
about on it. It was too dark in these storage places to see well, but a man could run his hand
over these piles of meat and sweep off handfuls of the dried dung of rats. These rats were
nuisances, and the packers would put poisoned bread out for them; they would die, and then
rats, bread, and meat would go into the hoppers together. This is no fairy story and no joke;
the meat would be shoveled into carts, and the man who did the shoveling would not trouble
to lift out a rat even when he saw one--there were things that went into the sausage in comparison
with which a poisoned rat was a tidbit. There was no place for the men to wash their hands
before they ate their dinner, and so they made a practice of washing them in the water that
was to be ladled into the sausage. There were the butt-ends of smoked meat, and the scraps
of corned beef, and all the odds and ends of the waste of the plants, that would be dumped
into old barrels in the cellar and left there. Under the system of rigid economy which the
packers enforced, there were some jobs that it only paid to do once in a long time, and among
these was the cleaning out of the waste barrels. Every spring they did it; and in the barrels
would be dirt and rust and old nails and stale water--and cartload after cartload of it would
be taken up and dumped into the hoppers with fresh meat, and sent out to the public's breakfast.
Some of it they would make into "smoked" sausage--but as the smoking took time, and was therefore
expensive, they would call upon their chemistry department, and preserve it with borax and
color it with gelatine to make it brown. All of their sausage came out of the same bowl, but
when they came to wrap it they would stamp some of it "special," and for this they would charge
two cents more a pound.

Such were the new surroundings in which Elzbieta was placed, and such was the work she was
compelled to do. It was stupefying, brutalizing work; it left her no time to think, no strength
for anything. She was part of the machine she tended, and every faculty that was not needed
for the machine was doomed to be crushed out of existence. There was only one mercy about the
cruel grind--that it gave her the gift of insensibility. Little by little she sank into a torpor--she
fell silent. She would meet Jurgis and Ona in the evening, and the three would walk home together,
often without saying a word. Ona, too, was falling into a habit of silence--Ona, who had once
gone about singing like a bird. She was sick and miserable, and often she would barely have
strength enough to drag herself home. And there they would eat what they had to eat, and afterward,
because there was only their misery to talk of, they would crawl into bed and fall into a stupor
and never stir until it was time to get up again, and dress by candlelight, and go back to
the machines. They were so numbed that they did not even suffer much from hunger, now; only
the children continued to fret when the food ran short.

Yet the soul of Ona was not dead--the souls of none of them were dead, but only sleeping; and
now and then they would waken, and these were cruel times. The gates of memory would roll open--old
joys would stretch out their arms to them, old hopes and dreams would call to them, and they
would stir beneath the burden that lay upon them, and feel its forever immeasurable weight.
They could not even cry out beneath it; but anguish would seize them, more dreadful than the
agony of death. It was a thing scarcely to be spoken--a thing never spoken by all the world,
that will not know its own defeat.

They were beaten; they had lost the game, they were swept aside. It was not less tragic because
it was so sordid, because it had to do with wages and grocery bills and rents. They had dreamed
of freedom; of a chance to look about them and learn something; to be decent and clean, to
see their child grow up to be strong. And now it was all gone--it would never be! They had
played the game and they had lost. Six years more of toil they had to face before they could
expect the least respite, the cessation of the payments upon the house; and how cruelly certain
it was that they could never stand six years of such a life as they were living! They were
lost, they were going down--and there was no deliverance for them, no hope; for all the help
it gave them the vast city in which they lived might have been an ocean waste, a wilderness,
a desert, a tomb. So often this mood would come to Ona, in the nighttime, when something wakened
her; she would lie, afraid of the beating of her own heart, fronting the blood-red eyes of
the old primeval terror of life. Once she cried aloud, and woke Jurgis, who was tired and cross.
After that she learned to weep silently--their moods so seldom came together now! It was as
if their hopes were buried in separate graves.
