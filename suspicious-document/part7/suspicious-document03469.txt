SERMON I.  'FATHERS AND CHILDREN'

Malachi iv. 5, 6.

These words are especially solemn words.  They stand in an especially solemn and important
part of the Bible.  They are the last words of the Old Testament.  I cannot but think that
it was God's will that they should stand where they are, and nowhere else. Malachi, the prophet
who wrote them, did not know perhaps that he was the last of the Old Testament prophets.  He
did not know that no prophet would arise among the Jews for 400 years, till the time when John
the Baptist came preaching repentance.  But God knew.  And by God's ordinance these words stand
at the end of the Old Testament, to make us understand the beginning of the New Testament.
For the Old Testament ends by saying that God would send to the Jews Elijah the prophet.  And
the New Testament begins by telling us of John the Baptist's coming as a prophet, in the spirit
and power of Elias; and how the Lord Jesus himself declared plainly that John the Baptist was
Elijah who was to come; that is, the Elijah of whom Malachi prophesies in my text.

Some may be ready to answer to this, 'Of course John the Baptist came to warn parents of behaving
wrongly to their children, if they were careless or cruel; and children to their parents, if
they were disobedient or ungrateful.  Of course he would tell bad parents and children to repent,
just as he came to tell all other kinds of sinners to repent.  But that was only a part of
John the Baptist's work.  He came to be the forerunner of the Messiah, the Saviour, the Redeemer.'

Be it so, my friends.  I only hope that you really do believe that John the Baptist did come
to proclaim that a Saviour was born into the world--provided only that you remember all the
while who that Saviour was.  John the Baptist tells you who He was.

Yes--you must remember who it was that John the Baptist came to bear record of, and to manifest
or show to the Jews.  The Angels on the first Christmas Eve told us--they said it was The Lord,
'Unto you,' they said, 'is born a Saviour, who is Christ, The Lord.'

John the Baptist told you and all mankind who it was--that it was The Lord.  'The voice of
one crying in the wilderness, Prepare ye the way of the Lord!'

The Lord.  What Lord--Which Lord?  John the Baptist knew.  Simeon, Anna, Nathaniel, all righteous
and faithful hearts who waited for the salvation of the Lord, knew.  The Pharisees and Sadducees
did not know.  The men who wrote our Creeds, our Prayer Book, our Church Catechism, knew. 
The Pharisees and the Sadducees in our day, who fancy themselves wiser than the Creeds, and
the Prayer Book, and the Church Catechism, do not know.  May God grant that we may all know,
not only with our lips, but with our hearts, our faith, our love, our lives, who The Lord is.

Jesus Christ, the babe of Bethlehem, is The Lord.  But who is He? The Bible tells us; when
we have heard what the Bible tells us we shall be able better to understand the text.  The
Lord is He of whom it is written, 'And God said, Let us make man in our image, after our likeness.'
And who is God's image and God's likeness?  The New Testament tells us--Jesus Christ.  In Him
man was made.  He is the Son of Man, who is in heaven--the true perfect pattern of man:  but
He is also the image and likeness of God, the brightness of His Father's glory, and the express
image of His person.  He is The Lord.  He is the Lord who instituted marriage, and said, 'It
is not good that the man should be alone; I will make him an help-meet for him.'  He is the
Lord who said to man, 'Be fruitful and multiply: fill the earth and subdue it.'  He is the
Lord who said to the first murderer, 'Thy brother's blood crieth against thee from the ground.'
He is the Lord who talked with Abraham face to face as a man talks with his friend; who blest
him by giving him a son in his old age, that he might be the father of many nations.  Thou
shalt not covet thy neighbour's property.'

This is The Lord.  Not a God far away from men; who does not feel for them, nor feel with them;
not a God who despises men, or has an ill-will to men, and must be won over to change his mind,
and have mercy on them, by many supplications and tears, and fear and trembling, and superstitious
ceremonies.  But this is The Lord, this is the babe of Bethlehem, this is He whose way John
the Baptist came to prepare--even He of whom it is written, that He possessed wisdom, the simple,
practical human wisdom, useful for this everyday earthly life of ours, which Solomon sets forth
in his Proverbs, in the beginning before His works of old; and that when He appointed the foundations
of the earth, that Wisdom was by Him, as one brought up with Him, and she was daily His delight;
rejoicing alway before Him; rejoicing in the habitable parts of the earth; and her delights
were with the sons of men.

In one word, He is the Lord, in whose likeness man is made.  Man's justice is a pattern of
His; man's love is a pattern of His; man's industry a pattern of His; man's Sabbath-rest, in
some unspeakable and eternal way, a pattern of His.  Man's family ties are patterns of His.
God the Father is He, said St. Paul, from whom every fathership in heaven and earth is named,
that we may be such fathers to our children as God is to us.  God The Son is He who is not
ashamed to call us brethren, and to declare to us the glorious news, that in Him we, too, are
the sons of God, that we may be such sons to our heavenly Father--ay, and to our earthly fathers
also, as the Lord Jesus was to His Father.

Yes--and even more wonderful still, and more blessed still, the Lord is not ashamed to call
himself a husband.  Our human wedlock and married love is a pattern of some divine mystery.
'Husbands love your wives, as Christ also loved the Church, and gave Himself for it, that He
might present it to Himself a glorious Church, not having spot or wrinkle, but that it should
be holy and without blemish.'  Blessed words, which we cannot pretend to explain or understand,
but can only believe and adore, and find, as we shall find, in proportion as we are loving
and faithful in wedlock, that God's Spirit bears witness with our spirit, that they are reasonable,
blessed, true; true for ever.

This, then, was the Lord who was coming to judge these Jews; not merely a god, but The God.
The Lord, in whose likeness man was made; who had appointed men to be fathers, sons, husbands,
citizens of a nation, owners of property, subject to laws, and yet makers of laws; because
all these things, in some wonderful way, are parts of His likeness.  He was coming to this
nation of the Jews first, and then to all the nations of the earth, to judge them, Malachi
said, with a great and terrible day.  To lay the axe to the root of the tree; to cut down from
the very root the evil principles which were working in society.  His fan was in His hand;
and He would thoroughly purge His floor; and gather His wheat into the garner, for the use
of future generations:  but the chaff, all that was empty, light, and useless, He would burn
up and destroy utterly out of the way, with unquenchable fire.  He would inquire of every man,
How have you kept my image; my likeness, in which I made you?  What sort of husbands, fathers,
sons, neighbours, subjects, and governors, have you been?  And above all, Malachi says, the
root question of all would be, what sort of fathers have you been to your children?  What sort
of children to your fathers?  Does that seem to you a small question, my friends?  Would you
have rather expected to hear John the Baptist ask, what sort of saints they had been?  What
sort of doctrines they were professing?

A small question?  Look at these two little words, Father and Son. Father and Son!  Are they
not the most deep and awful, as well as the most blessed and hopeful words on earth?  Do they
not tell us the very mystery of God's being?  Are they not the very name of God, God The Father
and God The Son, knit together by one Holy Spirit of Love to each other and to all, who proceeds
alike from The Father and from The Son?  And then, will you think it a light matter to ask
fallen creatures made in the likeness of that perfect Father and that perfect Son, what sort
of fathers and sons they have been?  God help us all, and give us grace to ask ourselves that
question morning and night, before the great and terrible day of the Lord come, lest He come
and smite this land with a curse.

I have been led to think deeply and to speak openly upon this solemn matter, my friends, by
seeing, as who can help seeing, the great division and estrangement between the old and the
young which is growing up in our days.  I do not, alas! I cannot, deny the complaints which
old people commonly make.  Old people complain that young people are grown too independent,

  Not one word is the child taught about what will happen to him after death, except
that his body will rise again, and that Christ will be his Judge after he is dead as well as
while he is alive:  but not one word about that salvation after he is dead, which is almost
the only thing of which one hears in many pulpits. And why, but because the Catechism teaches
the child to believe that Jesus Christ is his salvation now, in this life, and believes that
to be enough for him to know?  For if Christ be eternal, His salvation must be eternal also.
If Christ's life be in the child, eternal life must be in the child; for Christ's life must
be eternal, even as Christ Himself; and that is enough for the child, and for us also.  First
they forget the 'when,' and read it as if it stood, 'If the wicked man turn away from his wickedness
in this life, he shall save his soul in the next life:' but the Bible says much more than that.
It says, that when he turns, then and there, that moment he shall save his soul alive. And
next, they read the text as if it stood, 'he shall save his soul.'  Here again, my friends,
the Bible says a great deal more; it says, that he shall save his soul alive.  Perhaps that
does not seem to you any great difference?  Alas, alas, my friends, I fear that there are too
many now, as there have been in all times, who do not care for the difference.

For what is this same eternal death?  The opposite surely to eternal life.  Eternal life is
to know God, and therefore to obey Him.  Oh, my friends, is not that damnation indeed, to be
a devil here on earth, and for aught we know, for ever and ever?

Do you not know what frame of mind I mean?  Thank God, none of us, I suppose, is ever utterly
without some grain of love left for some one; none of us, I suppose, is ever utterly shut up
in himself; and as long as there is love there is life and as long as there is life there is
hope:  but yet there have been moments when one has felt with horror how near, and how terrible,
and how easy was this same eternal death which some fancy only possible after they die.

For, my friends, were you ever, any one of you, for one half hour, completely angry, completely
sulky? displeased and disgusted with everybody and everything round you, and yet displeased
and disgusted with yourself all the while; liking to think everyone wrong, liking to make out
that they were unjust to you; feeling quite proud at the notion that you were an injured person:
and yet feeling in your heart the very opposite of all these fancies:  feeling that you were
wrong, that you were unjust to them, and feeling utterly ashamed at the thought that they were
the injured persons, and that you had injured them.  And perhaps, to make all worse, the person
about whom all this storm had arisen in your heart, was some dear friend or relation whom you
loved (strange contradiction, yet most true) at the very moment that you were trying to hate.
Oh, my friends, if one such dark hour has ever come home to you; if you have ever let the sun
go down upon your wrath, and so given place to the devil, then you know something at least
of what eternal death is.  You know how, in such moments, there is a worm in the heart, and
a fire in the heart, compared with which all bodily torment would be light and bearable; a
worm in the heart which does not die:  and a fire in the heart which you cannot quench:  but
which if they remained there would surely destroy you.  So intolerable are they, that you feel
that you will actually and really die, in some strange unspeakable way, if you continue in
that temper long.  Do not there open at such times within our hearts black depths of evil,
a power of becoming wicked, a chance of being swept off into sin if one gives way, which one
never suspected till then; and yet with all these, the most dreadful sense of helplessness,
of slavery, of despair?--God grant that may not remain, for then comes the mad hope to escape
death by death, to try by one desperate stroke to rid oneself of that self which is for the
time one's torment, worm, fire, death, and hell. And what is this dark fight within us?  What
does the Bible call it? It is death and life, eternal death and eternal life, salvation and
damnation, hell and heaven, fighting together within our hapless hearts, to see which shall
be our masters.  It is the battle of the evil spirit, who is the Devil, fighting with the good
spirit, who is God.  Nothing less than that, my friends.  Yes, in those hateful and shameful
moments of pride, or spite, or contempt, or self-will, or suspicion, or sneering, on which
when they are past we look back with shame and horror, and wonder how we could have been such
wretches even for a moment,--at such times, I say, our heart is a battle-field, on which no
less than the Devil himself, and God Himself are fighting for our souls.  On one side, Satan
trying to bring us into that state of eternal death in which he lives himself; Satan, the loveless
one, the self-willed one, the accuser, the slanderer, slandering God to us, slandering man
to us, slandering to us the friends we love best and trust most utterly; yea, slandering our
own selves to us, trying to make us believe that we are as bad, ought to be as bad, and must
always be as bad as we seem for the time to be; that we cannot shake off our evil passions,
that we cannot rise again out of the eternal death of sin into the eternal life of righteousness.
And on the other side, the Spirit of God and of His Christ, the Spirit of eternal life, the
Spirit of justice, and righteousness, love, joy, peace, duty, self-sacrifice, trying to make
us know Him and see His beauty, and obey Him, and be at peace; trying to raise us again into
that eternal life and state of salvation which the Lord Jesus Christ has bought for us with
His most precious blood.

Oh, awful thought!  Life and death, the Devil himself, and the Lord Jesus Christ Himself, fighting
in your heart and in mine, and in the heart of every human being round us!  And yet most blessed
thought, hopeful, glorious,--full of the promise of eternal victory!  For greater is He that
is with us, than he that is against us; and He who conquered Satan for Himself, can and will
conquer him for us also.  No thing can separate us from the love of Christ; no thing, yea no
angel, or devil, principality, or power; no thing, but only ourselves, only our own proud and
wayward will and determination to the Devil's voice in our hearts, and not the voice of Christ,
the Word of Life, who is nigh us, in our hearts, even in our darkest moments, loving us still,
pitying us, ready, able and willing to help all who cast themselves on Him, and raise us, there
and then, the very moment we cry to Him and renounce the Devil and our own foolish will, out
of self-will into God's will, out of darkness into light, out of hatred into love, out of despair
into hope, out of doubt into faith, out of tempest into peace, out of the death of sin into
the life of righteousness, the life of love and charity, which abideth for ever.  Oh, listen
not to the lying, slanderous Devil, who tells you that by your own sin you have lost your share
in Christ, lost baptismal grace, lost Christ's love--Lost His love? His, who, were you in the
very lowest depths of hell, would pity you still?  His love, who Himself went down into hell,
and preached to the spirits in prison, to show that he did care even for them?  Not so:  into
Him you have been baptized.  His cross is on your foreheads, His Father is your Father:--and
can a father desert his child, even though he sinned seventy and seven times, if seventy and
seven times he turn and repent?  Can man weary God?  Can the creature conquer and destroy the
love of his Creator?  Can Christ deny Himself?  Not so; whosoever thou art, however sorely
tempted, however deeply fallen, however disgusted and terrified at thyself, turn only to that
blessed face which wept over Jerusalem, to that great heart which bled for thee upon the cross,
and thou shalt find him unchanged, the same yesterday, to-day, and for ever, the Lord of life
and love, able and willing to save to the uttermost all who come to God through Him, and the
accusing Devil shall turn and flee, and thou shalt know that thy Redeemer liveth still, and
in thy flesh thou shalt see the salvation of God, and cry, 'Rejoice not against me, Satan,
mine enemy; for when I fall I shall arise.'

SERMON III.  A GOOD CONSCIENCE

1 Peter iii. 21.

These words are very wide words; too wide to please most people. They preach a very free grace;
too free to please most people.  Such free and full grace, indeed, that some who talk most
about free grace, and insist most on man's being saved only by free grace, are the very men
who shrink from these words most, and would be more comfortable in their minds, I suspect,
if they were not in the Bible at all, because the grace they preach is too free.  But so it
always has been, and so it is, and so, I suppose, it always will be.

Just in the same way do people stumble at certain invaluable words in the Church Catechism,
which teach children to thank God for having brought them into that state of salvation.  Even
very good people, and people who really wish to believe and honour the Church Catechism, and
the Sacrament of Baptism, find these words too strong to please them, and say, that of course
a child's being in a state of salvation cannot mean that he is saved, but that he may be saved
after he dies.

My friends, I never could find that we have a right to take liberties with the Bible and the
Prayer Book which we dare not take with any other book, and to put meanings into the words
of them which, in the case of any other book, would be contrary to plain grammar and the English
tongue, if not to common sense and honesty.

If you say of a man, 'he is in a state of happiness,' you mean, do you not, that he is happy
now, not that he may perhaps be happy some day?  If you came to me and told me that you were
in a state of hunger, you would think it a very strange answer to receive if I say, 'Very well
then, if you become hungry, come to me, and I will feed you?'  You all know that a man's being
in a state of poverty, or of misery, means that he is poor or miserable now, here, at this
very time; that if a man is in a state of sickness, he is sick; if he is in a state of health,
he is healthy.  Then what can a man's being in a state of salvation mean, by all rules of English,
but that he is saved?  If I were to say to any one of the good people who do not think so,
'My friend, you are in a state of damnation,' he would answer me quickly enough, 'I am not,
for I am not damned.' He would agree that a man's being in a state of damnation means that
the man is damned; why will he not agree that a man's being in a state of salvation means that
he is saved?  Because, my friends, God's grace is too full for fallen man's notions; and therefore
there is an evil fashion abroad in the world, that where a text speaks of wrath, and misery
and punishment, you are to interpret it exactly, and to the very letter:  but where it speaks
of love, and mercy, and forgiveness, you are to do no such thing, but narrow it, and fence
it, and explain it away, for fear you should make sinners too comfortable,--a plan which seems
wise enough, but which, like other plans of man's wisdom, has not succeeded too well, to judge
by the number of sinners who are already too comfortable though they hear the Bible misused,
and God's grace narrowed in this way every Sunday of their lives.

But, my friends, we call ourselves Englishmen and churchmen; let us be honest Englishmen and
plain churchmen, and take our Catechism as it stands.  For rightly or wrongly, truly or falsely,
it does teach every christened child to thank God, not merely that it has some chance of being
saved, when it dies, but that it is saved already, now, here on earth.

Whether that is true or false is another question.  I believe it to be true.  I believe the
text to be true; I believe that why people shrink from it is, that they have got into their
minds a wrong, unscriptural, superstitious notion of what being saved, and saving one's soul
alive, and salvation mean.  And I beg all of you who read your Bibles to search the Scriptures
from beginning to end, and try to find out what these words mean, and whether the Catechism
has not kept close, after all, to the words of Scripture.  It will be better for you, my friends;
it will be worth your while, to know exactly what being saved means; for to judge by the signs
of the times, there are, very probably, days coming in which it will be as needful for you
and for your children to save your souls alive lest you die, as ever it was for the Jews in
Isaiah's or Jeremiah's time, or for the Romans in St. Paul's time; and that in that day you
will find the Catechism wider, and deeper, and sounder than you have ever suspected it to be,
and see, I trust, that in these very words it preaches to you, and me, and our children after
us, the one true Gospel and good news, which will stand, and grow, and shine brighter and brighter
for ever, when all the paltry, narrow, counterfeit gospels which man invents in its place have
been burnt up by the unquenchable fire with which the merciful Lord purges the chaff from His
floor.

I told you this morning what I believe that salvation was,--to know God, and Jesus Christ,
whom He has sent.  To know God's likeness, God's character, what God has shown of His own character,
what He has done for us.  To know His boundless love, and mercy, and knowing that, to trust
in Him utterly, and submit to Him utterly, and obey Him utterly, sure that He loves us, that
His will to us is goodwill, that His commandments must be life.  To know God, and therefore
to love Him and to serve Him, that is salvation.

Now what hinders a little child, from the very moment that it can think or speak, from entering
into that salvation?  Not the child's own heart.  There is evil in the child--true.  Is there
none in you and me?  There is a corrupt nature in the child--true.  Is there not in you and
me?  Woe to us if we have not found it out:  woe to us if we dare to think that we are in ourselves--or
out of ourselves either--one whit better than our own children.  What should hinder any child
whom you or I ever saw from knowing God, and His Name, the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit?

Has he not an earthly father, through whom he may know The Father? Is he not an earthly son;
and through that may he not know The Son?  Has he not a conscience, a spirit in him which knows
good from evil? holiness from wickedness--far more clearly and tenderly than the souls of most
grown people do? and can he not, therefore, understand you when you speak of a Holy Spirit,
a Spirit which puts good desires into his heart, and can enable him to bring those good desires
into practice? This is the reason, my friends; and this hindrance, at least, I know.  I will
not copy those parents, my friends, and tell them, as they tell their children, that they are
bringing on themselves endless torture; but I must tell them, for the Lord Christ has told
them, that they are bringing on themselves something--I know not what--of which it is written,
that it were better for them that a millstone were hanged about their necks, and that they
were drowned in the depth of the sea.  Oh, my friends, if I speak sternly, almost bitterly,
when I speak of parents' sins, it is because I speak for those who cannot speak for themselves.
I plead for Christ's little ones:  I plead for the souls and consciences of those little children
of whom Christ said, 'Suffer the little children to come unto me;' not that they might become
His, but because they were His already; not that they might win His love, but because He loved
them from all eternity:  not that they might enter into the kingdom of heaven, but, because
they were in the kingdom of heaven already; because the kingdom of heaven was made up of such
as them, and the angels who ministered unto them always beheld the face of our Father who is
in heaven.  Yes; I plead for those children, of whom the Lord said, 'Except ye be converted,'
that is, utterly turned and changed, 'and become as little children, ye shall in no wise enter
into the kingdom of heaven.'  Deep and blessed words, which are the root-rule of all true righteousness;
which so few really believe at heart, any more than the Pharisees, and Sadducees, and Herodians
of old did. Up and down, all over England, I hear men of all denominations saying, not, 'Except
we grown people be converted and become as little children;' but, 'except the little children
be converted, and become like us, grown people.'  God grant that the little children may not
become like too many grown people!  God grant it, I say. God grant that our children may not
become like us!  God grant that they may keep through youth and manhood, and through the grave,
and through all worlds to come, the tender and childlike heart, which we too often have hardened
in ourselves by bigotry and superstition, and dead faith, and lip-worship!  And I can have
good hope that God will grant it.  I can have hope that God will teach our children and our
children's children truly to know Him whose name is Love and Righteousness, the Father, the
Son, and the Holy Spirit, as long as I see His providence preserving for us this old Church
Catechism, to teach our children what we forget to teach them, or what we have not faith enough
to teach them.

Yes, I can have hope for England; and hope for those mighty nations across the seas, whose
earthly mother God has ordained that she should be, as long as the Catechism is taught to her
children.

For see.  This Catechism does not begin with telling children that they are sinners:  they
will find that out soon enough for themselves, poor little things, from their own wayward and
self- willed hearts.  Nor by telling them that man is fallen and corrupt: they will find out
that also soon enough, from the way in which they see people go on around them.  It does not
even begin by telling them that they ought to be good, or what goodness and righteousness is;
because it takes for granted that they know that already; it takes for granted that The Light
who lights every man who comes into the world is in them; even the Lord Jesus Christ Himself,
stirring up in their hearts, as He does in the heart of every child, the knowledge of good
and the love of good.  But it begins at once by teaching the child the name of God.  It goes
at once to the root of the matter; to the fountain of goodness itself; even to God, the Father
of lights.  It is so careful of God's honour, so careful that the child should learn from the
first to look up to God with love and trust, that it dare not tell the child that God can destroy
and punish, before it has told him that God is a Father and a Maker; the Father of spirits,
who has made him and all the world.  It dare not tell him that mankind is fallen, before it
has told him that all the world is redeemed.  It dare not talk to him of unholiness, before
it has taught him that the Holy Spirit of God is with him, to make him holy.  It tells him
of a world, a flesh, and a devil:  but he has renounced them.  He has neither part nor lot
in them; and he is not to think of them yet.  He is to think of that in which he has part and
lot, of which he is an inheritor.  He is to know where he is and ought to be, before he knows
where he is not and ought not to be: he is to think of the name of God, by which he can trample
world, flesh, and devil under foot, if they dare hereafter meddle with his soul.  In its God-inspired
tenderness and prudence, it dare not darken the heart of one little child, or tempt him to
hard thoughts of God, or to cry, 'Why hast thou made me thus?' lest it put a stumbling-block
in the way of Christ's little ones, and dishonour the name and glory of God.  It tells him
of the love, before it tells him of the wrath; of the order, before it tells him of the disorder;
of the right, before the wrong; of the health, before the disease; of the freedom, before the
bondage; of the truth, before the lies; of the light, before the darkness; in one word, it
tells him first of the eternal and good God, who was, and is, and shall be to all eternity,
before and above the evil devil.  It tells him of the name of God; and tells him that God is
with him, and he with God, and bids him believe that, and be saved, from his birth-hour, to
endless ages.  It does not tell him to pray that he may become God's child; but to pray, because
he is God's child already.  It does not tell him to love God, in order that he may make God
love him; but to love God because God loves him already, and has loved him from all eternity.
It does not tell him to obey Jesus Christ, in order that Christ may save him; but to obey Christ
because Christ has saved him, and bought him with his own blood.  It does not tell him to do
good works, in order that God's Spirit may be pleased with him, and come to him, and make him
one of the elect; neither does it tell him, that some day or other, if he is converted, and
feels certain religious experiences, he will have a right to consider himself one of God's
elect:  but it tells him to look man and devil in the face, he, the poor little ignorant village
child, and say boldly in the name of God, 'I am one of God's elect.  The Holy Spirit of God
is sanctifying me, and making me holy.  God has saved me; and I heartily thank my Heavenly
Father, who has called me to this state of salvation.'  It tells him to believe that he is
safe-- safe in the ark of Christ's Church, as Noah was safe in the ark at the deluge; and that
the one way to keep himself within that ark is to obey Him to whom it belongs, who judges it
and will guide it for ever, Jesus Christ, the likeness of God; and that as long as he does
that, neither world, flesh, nor devil, can harm him; even as Noah was safe in the ark, and
nothing could drown him but his own wilful casting himself out of the ark, and trying to free
the flood of waters by his own strength and cunning.

It tells him, I say, that he is safe, and saved, even as David, and Isaiah, and all holy men
who ever lived have been, as long as he trusts in God, and clings to God, and obeys God; and
that only when he forsakes God, and follows his own selfishness and pride, can anything or
being in earth or hell harm him.

And do not fancy, my friends, that this is a mere unimportant question of words and doctrines,
because a baptized and educated child may be lost after all, and fall from his state of salvation
into a state of damnation.  Still more, do not fancy that if a child is taught that he is already
a child of God, regenerated in baptism, and elect by God's Spirit, that therefore he will neglect
either vital faith or good works--heaven forbid!

Is it likely to make a child careless, and inclined to neglect vital truth, to tell him that
God is his Father and loves him utterly, and has given His only begotten Son to die for him?
Is it not the very way, the only way, to stir up in him faith, and real hearty trust and affection
towards God?  How can you teach him to trust God, but by telling him that God has shown himself
boundlessly and perfectly worthy to be trusted by every soul of man; or to love God, but by
showing him that God loves him already?  Is it likely to make a child careless of good works,
to tell him that God has elected and chosen him, and all his brothers and schoolfellows, to
be conformed into the likeness of Jesus Christ, and that every good, and honourable, and gentle
thought or feeling which ever crosses his little heart, does not come from himself, is not
part of his own nature or character, but is nothing less than the inspiration of the Holy Spirit,
nothing less than the voice of Almighty God Himself, speaking to the child's heart, that he
may answer with Samuel-- 'Speak, Lord, for thy servant heareth?'  Is it likely to make a child
careless about losing eternal life, to tell him that God has already given to him eternal life,
and that that life is in His Son Jesus Christ, to whom the child belongs, body, soul, and spirit?

Judge for yourselves, my friends.  Think what awe, what reverence, purity, dread of sin, would
grow up in a child who was really taught all this, and yet what faith and love to God, what
freedom, and joyfulness, and good courage about his own duty and calling in life.

And then look at the fruits which in general follow a religious education, as it is miscalled;
and take warning.  For if you really train up your children in the way in which they should
go, be sure that when they are old they will not depart from it--a promise which is not fulfilled
to most religious education which we see around us now-a-days; from which sad fact, if Scripture
be inspired and infallible, we can only judge that such is not the way in which the children
should go; and that because it is a wrong way, therefore God will not, and man cannot, keep
them in it.

SERMON IV.  NAMES

Matthew i. 21.  And thou shall call his name Jesus.

Did it ever seem to you a curious thing that the Catechism begins by asking the child its name?
'What is your name?'  'Who gave you this name?'  I think that if you were not all of you accustomed
to the Church Catechism from your childhood, that would seem a strange way of beginning to
teach a child about religion.

But the more I consider, the more sure I am that it is the right way to begin teaching a child
what the Catechism wishes to teach.

Do not fancy that it begins by asking the child's name just because it must begin somehow,
and then go on to religion afterwards.  Do not fancy that it merely supposes that the clergyman
does not know the child's name, and must ask it; for this Catechism is intended to be taught
by parents to their children, and masters to their apprentices and servants; by people, therefore,
who know the child's name perfectly well already, and yet they are to begin by asking the child
his name.

Now, why is this?  What has a child's name to do with his Faith and duty as a Christian?

You may answer, Because his Christian name is given him when he is baptized.

But why is his Christian name given him when he is baptized?  Why then rather than at any other
time?

Because it is the old custom of the Church.  No doubt it is:  and a most wise and blessed custom
it is; and one which shows us how much more about God and man the churchmen in old times knew,
than most of our religious teachers now-a-days.  But how did that old custom arise?  What put
into the minds of church people, for the last sixteen hundred years at least, that being baptized
and being named had anything to do with each other?  Men had names of their own long before
the Lord Jesus came, long before His Baptism was heard of on earth;--the heathens of old had
their names--the heathens have names still;--why, then, did church people feel it right to
mix a new thing like baptism with a world-old thing like giving a name?

My friends, I feel and say honestly, that there is more in this matter than I understand; and
what little I do understand, I could not explain fully in one sermon, or in many either.  But
let this be enough for to-day.  God grant that I may be able to make you understand me.

Any one's having a name--a name of his own, a Christian name, as we rightly call it--signifies
that he is a person; that is, that he has a character of his own, and a responsibility, and
a calling and duty of his own, given him by God; in one word, that he has an immortal soul
in him, for which he, and he alone, must answer, and receive the rewards of the deeds which
it does in the body, whether they be good or evil.  But names are not given at random, without
cause or meaning.  When Adam named all the beasts, we read that whatsoever he called any beast,
that was the name of it.  The names which he gave described each beast, were taken from something
in its appearance, or its ways and habits, and so each was its right name, the name which expressed
its nature.  And so now, when learned men discover animals or plants in foreign countries,
they do not give them names at random, but take care to invent names for them which may describe
their natures, and make people understand what they are like, as Adam did for the beasts of
old.  And much more, in old times, had the names of men each of them a meaning.  If it was
reasonable to give names full of meaning to each kind of dumb animal, which are mere things,
and not persons at all, how much more to each man separately, for each man is a person of himself;
each man has a character different from all others, a calling different from all others, and
therefore he ought to have his own name separate from all others:  and therefore in old times
it was the custom to give each child a separate name, which had a meaning in it, was, as it
were, a description of the child, or of something particular about the child.

Now, we may see this, above all, in The adorable Name of Jesus. That name, above all others,
ought to show us what a name means; for it is the name of the Son of Man, the one perfect and
sinless man, the pattern of all men; and therefore it must be a perfect name, and a pattern
for all names; and it was given to the Lord not by man, but by God; not after He was born,
but before He was conceived in the womb of the blessed Virgin.  And therefore, it must show
and mean not merely some outward accident about Him, something which He seemed to be, or looked
like, in men's eyes:  no, the Name of Jesus must mean what the Lord was in the sight of His
Father in Heaven; what He was in the eternal purpose of God the Father; what He was, really
and absolutely, in Himself; it must mean and declare the very substance of His being.  And
so, indeed, it does; for The adorable Name of Jesus means nothing else but God the Saviour--God
who saves. This is His name, and was, and ever will be.  This Name He fulfilled on earth, and
proved it to be His character, His exact description, His very Name, in short, which made Him
different from all other beings in heaven or earth, create or uncreate; and therefore, He bears
His name to all eternity, for a mark of what He has been, and is, and will be for ever--God
the Saviour; and this is the perfect name, the pattern of all other names of men.

Now though the Christian names which we give our children here in England, have no especial
meaning to them, and have nothing to do with what we expect or wish the children to be when
they grow up, yet the names of people in most other countries in the world have. The Jewish
names which we find in the Bible have almost all of them a meaning.  So Simeon, I believe,
means 'Obedient'; Jehoshaphat means, 'The Lord will judge'; Daniel, 'God is my judge'; Isaiah
means, 'The Salvation of the Lord'; Isaac means, 'She laughs,' as a memorial of Sarah's laughing,
when she heard that she was to have a child; Ishmael means, 'The Lord hears,' in remembrance
of God's hearing Hagar's cry in the wilderness, when Ishmael was dying of thirst.

Especially those names of which we read that God commanded them to be given, have meanings,
and to tell the persons who bore those names what God expected of them, or would do for them.
So Abraham means, 'The father of many nations.'  So the children of both Isaiah and Hosea had
names given them by God, each of them meaning something which God was going to do to the nation
of the Jews.  And so John means, 'Given by the Lord,' which name was given to John the Baptist
by the Angel, before his strange birth, in his mother's old age.

But we must remember that the heathens also gave names to their children, though they did not
know that their children owed any duty to God, or belonged to God, and therefore we cannot
call their names Christian names.  Yes, the heathens did give their children names; some of
them give their children names still.  And there is to me something most sad and painful in
those heathen names, and yet most full of meaning.  A solemn lesson to us, to show us what
the fall means; what man becomes, when he gives way to his fallen nature, and is parted from
Christ, the Head of man.

First, these heathens had a dim remembrance that man was made in the likeness of God, and lived
by Faith in God, and therefore that men's names were to express that, as indeed many of their
old names do. But, alas! the likeness of God in fallen man is like a tree without roots, or
rather a tree without soil to grow in.  God's likeness in man can only flourish as long as
he is joined to Christ, the perfect likeness of God, the true life and the true light of men,
the foundation which is already laid, and the soil in which man was meant to grow and flourish
for ever, and as long as he is fed by the Spirit of God, the Lord and Giver of Life, who proceeds--never
forget that, or you will lose the understanding both of who God is and what man is--proceeds
not only from God the Father, but also from God the Son, the Lord Jesus Christ.  And therefore,
in the heathen, God's likeness withered and decayed, as a tree withers and decays when torn
up from the soil.  And first, they began to call themselves after the names of false gods,
which they had invented out of their own carnal fancies.  Then they called themselves after
the names of their dumb animal's.  So, Pharaoh means, 'The Sun-God'; the Ammonites mean, 'The
people who worshipped the ram as a god'; Potiphar means, 'A fat bull,' which the Egyptians
used to worship; and I could tell you of hundreds of heathen names more, like these, which
are ridiculous enough to make one smile, if we did not keep in mind what tokens they are of
sin and ignorance, and the likeness not of God, but of the beasts which perish.

Then comes another set of names, showing a lower fall still, when heathens have quite forgotten
that man was originally made in God's likeness, and are not only content to live after the
likeness of the beasts which perish, but pride themselves on being like beasts, and therefore
name their children after dumb animals,--the girls after the gentler and fairer animals, and
the boys after ravenous and cruel beasts of prey.  That has been the custom among many heathen
nations; perhaps among almost all of them, at some time or other. It is the custom now among
the Red Indians in North America, where you will find one man in a tribe called 'The Bull,'
another 'The Panther,' and another 'The Serpent,' and so on; showing that they would like to
be, if they could, as strong as the bull, as cruel as the panther, as venomous as the serpent.
What wonder that those Red Indians, who have so put on the likeness of the beasts, are now
dying off the face of the earth like the beasts whom they admire and imitate?

And this was the way with our own heathen forefathers before the blessed Gospel was preached
to them.  It is frightful, in reading old histories, to find how many Englishmen, our own forefathers,
were named after fierce wild beasts, and tried, alas! to be like their names--children of wrath,
whose feet were swift to shed blood, under whose lips was the poison of adders, and destruction
and bloodshed following in their paths, not knowing the way of peace. The wolf was the common
wild beast of England then; and there are, I should say, twenty common old English names ending
in wolf, besides as many more ending in bear, and eagle, and raven.  Fearful sign! that men
of our own flesh and blood should have gloried in being like the wolf, the cruellest, the greediest,
the most mean of savage beasts!  How shall we thank God enough, who sent to them the knowledge
of His Son Jesus Christ, and called them to be new men in Christ Jesus, and called them to
holy baptism, to receive new names, and begin new lives in the righteous likeness of God Himself?--that
as by nature they had been the children of wrath, so in baptism they might become the children
of grace; that as from their forefathers they had inherited a corrupt nature, original sin,
and the likeness of the foul and ravenous beasts which perish, they might have power from the
Spirit of God to become the sons of God, conformed into the likeness of Jesus Christ, in peace,
and love, and righteousness, and all holiness.

And yet, in names there is a lower depth still among fallen and heathen men; when they lose
utterly the last dim notion that God intends men to be persons, even as God the Father is a
person, and God the Son a person, and God the Holy Spirit is a person, and so lose the custom
of giving their children personal names at all; either giving them, after they grow up, mere
nicknames, taken from some peculiarity of their bodies, or something which they have done,
or some place where they happen to live; or else, like many tribes of heathen negroes, just
name them after the day of the week on which they were born, as some way of knowing them apart;
or, last and most shocking of all, give them no names at all, and have no names themselves,
knowing each other apart as the dumb animals do, only by sight.  I can conceive no deeper fall
into utter brutishness than that; and yet some few of the most savage tribes, both in Africa
and in the Indian islands, are said--God help them!--to live in that way, and to have no names;--blotted,
indeed, out of the book of life!

But is this the right state for men?  No; it is the wrong state.  It is a disease into which
men are fallen; a disease out of which Christ came to raise men; and out of which He does raise
us in Holy Baptism.  Baptism puts the child into its right state--into the right state for
a human being, a human soul, a human person.  And baptism declares what that right state is--a
member of Christ, a child of God, and an inheritor of the kingdom of heaven.  A member of Christ,
and therefore a person, because Christ is a person.  A child of God, and therefore a person,
because a child's duty is to love and trust and obey his father--and only a person can do that,
not an animal or a thing.  An inheritor of the kingdom of heaven, and therefore bound to cherish
all heavenly thoughts and feelings, all righteousness, love, and obedience, which only spirits
and persons, not animals or things, can feel.

Now can you not see why baptism is the proper time for giving the child a name?  Because then
Christ claims the child for His own;-- because having a name shows that the child is a person
who has a soul, a will, a conscience, a duty; a person who must answer himself for himself
alone for what he does in the body, whether it be good or evil.  And that will, and soul, and
conscience were given the child by Christ, by whom all things are made, who is the Light which
lights every man who comes into the world.

Thus in holy baptism God adopts the child for His own in Jesus Christ.  He declares that the
child is regenerate, and has a new life, a life from above, a seed of eternal personal life
which he himself has not by nature.  And that seed of eternal life is none other but the Holy
Spirit of God, the Spirit of the Father and of the Son, the Lord and Giver of Life, who does
verily and indeed regenerate the child in holy baptism, and dwells with his soul, his person,
his very self, that He may educate the child's character, and raise his affections, and subdue
his will, and raise him up daily from the death of sin to the life of righteousness.

Therefore, when in the Catechism you solemnly ask the child its name, you ask it no light question.
You speak as a spirit, a person, to its spirit, to its very self, which God wills should never
perish, but live for ever.  You single the child out from all its schoolfellows, from all the
millions of human beings who have ever lived, or ever will live; and you make the child, by
answering to his name, confess that he is a person, an immortal soul, who must stand alone
before the judgment seat of God; a person who has a duty and a calling upon God's earth, which
he must fulfil or pay the forfeit.  And then you ask the child who gave him his name, and make
him declare that his name was given him in baptism, wherein he was made a member of Christ
and a child of God.  You make the child confess that he is a person in Jesus Christ, that Christ
has redeemed him, his very self, and taken him to Himself, and made him not merely God's creature,
or God's slave, but God's child.  You make the child confess that his duty as a person is not
towards himself, to do what he likes, and follow his own carnal lusts; but toward God and toward
his neighbours, who are in God's kingdom of heaven as well as he.  And then you go on in the
rest of the Catechism to teach him how he himself, the person to whom you are speaking, may
live for ever and ever as a person, by faith in other Persons beside himself, even in God the
Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, as you teach him in the Creed; by doing his duty to other persons
beside himself, even to God and man, as you teach him in the Ten Commandments; and by diligent
prayer to another Person beside himself, even to God his heavenly Father, to feed and strengthen
him day by day with that eternal life which was given to him in baptism. Thus the whole Catechism
turns upon the very first question in it-- 'What is thy name?'  It explains to the child what
is really meant, in the sight of God, and of the Lord Jesus Christ, and of the whole Church
in earth and heaven, by the child's having a name of his own, and being a person, and having
that name given to him in holy baptism.

And if this is true of our children, my friends, it is equally true of us.  You and I are persons,
and persons in Christ; each stands alone day and night before the judgment-seat of Christ.
Each must answer for himself.  None can deliver his brother, nor make agreement unto God for
him.  Each of us has his calling from his heavenly Father; his duty to do which none can do
instead of him. Each has his own sins, his own temptations, his own sorrows, which he must
bring single-handed and alone to God his Father, as it is written, 'The heart knoweth its own
bitterness, and a stranger intermeddleth not with its joy.'  There is a world, a flesh, and
a devil, near to us, ready to drag us down, and destroy our personal and spiritual life, which
God has given us in Christ; a flesh which tempts us to follow our own appetites and passions,
blindly and lawlessly, like the beasts which perish; a world which tempts us to become mere
things, without free-wills of our own, or consciences of our own, without personal faith and
personal holiness; the puppets of the circumstances and the customs which happen to be round
us; blown about like the dead leaf, and swept helplessly down the stream of time.  And there
is a devil, too, near us, tempting us to the deepest lie of all,--to set up ourselves apart
from God, and to try, as the devil tries, to be persons in our own strength, each doing what
he chooses, each being his own law, and his own master; that is, his own lawlessness, and his
own tyrant:  and if we listen to that devil, that spirit of lawlessness and self-will, we shall
become his slaves, persons in him, doing his work, and finding torment and misery and slavery
in it.  Awful thought, that so many enemies should be against us; yea, that we ourselves should
be our own enemies!  But here baptism gives us hope, baptism gives us courage; we are in Christ;
God is our Father, and He can and will give us power to have victory, and to triumph against
the world, the flesh, and the devil.  His Spirit is given to us in baptism--that Spirit of
God who is not merely a force or an influence, but a person, a living, loving, holy Person.
He is with us, to give our persons, our souls, eternal life from His life, eternal holiness
from His holiness; that so, not merely some part of us, but we our very selves and souls--we
the very same persons who were christened, and had a name given us in holy baptism, and have
been answering to that name all our life, and were reminded, whenever we heard that name, that
we had a duty of our own, a history of our own, hopes, fears, joys, sorrows of our own, which
none could share with us,-- that we, I say, our own persons, our very selves, may be raised
up again at the last day, free, pure, strong, filled with the life of God, which is eternal life.

And then, what blessed words are these from the Lord Jesus, which we read in the book of Revelation?
'And I will give to him that overcometh, a new name.'  A new name for him that overcometh world,
flesh, and devil; that shall be our portion in the world to come.  A new name, perfect like
the name of the Lord Jesus, which shall express and mean all that we are to do hereafter, and
all that we have done well on earth.  A name which shall declare to us our calling and work
in God's Church triumphant, throughout all ages and worlds to come:  and yet a name which no
man knoweth saving he who receiveth it.  Yes, if we may dare to guess at the meaning of those
deep words, perhaps in that new name shall be recorded for each man all that went on, in the
secret depths of the man's own heart, between himself and his God, unknown and unnoticed even
by the wife of his bosom.  The cup of cold water given in Christ's name; the little private
acts of love, and kindness, and self-sacrifice, of which none but God knew; the secret prayers,
the secret acts of contrition, the secret hungerings and thirstings after righteousness, the
secret struggles and agonies of heart, which he could not, dare not, ought not to tell to any
human being.  All these, he shall find, will go to make up his character in the life to come,
to determine what work he is to do for God in the world to come; as it is written, 'Be thou
faithful over a few things, and I will make thee ruler over many things.'  All these, perhaps,
shall be expressed and declared in that new name, the full meaning of which none will know
but the man himself, because none but he knows the secret experiences and struggles which went
toward the making of it; none but he and God; for God will know all, He who is the Lord and
Saviour of our souls, our persons, our very selves, and can preserve them utterly to the fulness
of eternal life, because He knows them thoroughly and utterly; because He judges not according
to appearance, but judges righteous judgment; because He sees us not merely as we seem to others
to be, not even as we seem at times to ourselves to be;--but searches the heart, and can be
touched with the feeling of its infirmities, seeing that He himself has been tempted even as
we are, yet without sin; because, blessed thought! He can pierce through the very marrow of
our being, and discern the thoughts and intents of our hearts, and see what we long to be,
and what we ought to be; so that we can safely and hopefully commend our spirits to His hand,
day by day and hour by hour, and can trust Him to cleanse us from our secret faults, and to
renew and strengthen our very selves day by day with that eternal life which He gives to all
who cast themselves utterly upon Him.

SERMON V.  SPONSORSHIP

1 Cor. xii. 26, 27.  Now ye are the body of Christ, and members in particular.

I have to tell you that there will be a confirmation held at . . . on the . . . All persons
of fit age who have not yet been confirmed ought to be ready, and I hope and trust that most
of them will be ready, on that day to profess publicly their faith and loyalty to the Lord
who died for them.  I hope and trust that they will, as soon as possible, tell me that they
intend to do so, and come to me to talk over the matter, and to learn what I can teach them
about it.  They will find in me, I hope, nothing but kindness and fellow- feeling.

But I have not only to tell young persons of the Confirmation:  I have to tell all godfathers
and godmothers of it also.  Have any of you here ever stood godfather or godmother to any young
person in this parish who is not yet confirmed?  If you have, now is the time for you to fulfil
your parts as sponsors.  You must help me, and help the children's parents, in bringing your
godchildren to confirmation.  It really is your duty.  It will be better for you if you fulfil
it.  Better for you, not merely by preventing a punishment, but by bringing a blessing.  Let
me try to show you what I mean.

Now godparents must have some duty, some responsibility or other;-- that is plain.  If you
or I promise and vow things in another person's name, we must be bound more or less to see
that that other person fulfils the promise which we made for him:  and so the baptism service
warns the sponsors as soon as the child is christened, 'Forasmuch as this child has promised,'
&c.; and then we have a plain explanation of what a godfather and godmother's duties are. 
'And that your godchild may know these things the better,' &c.:  and finally, 'you shall take
care that this child be brought to the bishop to be confirmed.'

That is the duty of godfathers and godmothers.  Those who stand for any child do it on that
understanding, and take upon themselves knowingly that duty.

Now, I will not threaten you, my friends; I will not pretend to tell you how God will punish
those godfathers and godmothers who do not do their duty; because I do not know how he will
punish them.  He has not told us in the Bible; and who am I, to deal out God's thunders as
if they belonged to me, and judge people of whose real merits and dements in God's sight I
have no fair means of judging?  And sure I am, that any godfathers and godmothers who do their
duty, only because they are afraid that God will punish them if they do not, will not do their
duty at all.  But sure I am also, and thankful to God, that we cannot neglect any duty whatsoever
without being punished in some way or other for our neglect of it.  That is not a curse, but
a blessing:  it is a blessing to us to be punished.  The only real curse of God in this life
is to be left unpunished for our sins.  It is a blessing for us that our sins find us out.
For if our sins did not find us out, we should very often, I fear, not find our sins out. 
And, therefore, when I tell godfathers and godmothers, not that God will perhaps punish them
for their neglect, but that He does punish them for it already, I am telling them good news,
if they will only open their hearts to that good news.

For God does punish people for neglecting their godchildren.  Those who have eyes to see may
see it round us now, in this very parish, and in every parish in England, in the selfishness,
distrust, divisions, and quarrels which prevail.  I do not mean that this parish is worse than
others, or England worse than other countries. That is no concern of ours:  our own parish,
and our own evils, are quite concern enough for us.

Are people happy together?  Do they pull well together?  Look at the old-standing quarrels,
misunderstandings, grudges, prejudices, suspicions, which part one man from another, one family
from another; every man for his own house, and very few for the kingdom of God;--no, not even
for the general welfare of the parish!  Do not men try to better themselves at the expense
of the parish--to the injury of the parish?  Do not men, when they try to raise their own family,
seem to think that the simplest way to do it is to pull down their neighbour's family; to draw
away their custom; oust them from their places, or hurt their characters in order to rise upon
their fall? so that though they are brothers, members of the same church, nation and parish,
the greater part of them are, in practice, at war with each other--trying to live at each other's
expense.  Now, is this profitable?  So far from it, that if you will watch the history, either
of the whole world, or of this country, or of this one parish, you will find that by far the
greater part of the misery in it has sprung from this very selfishness and separateness--from
the perpetual struggle between man and man, and between family and family:  so that there have
been men, and those learned, and thoughtful, and well-meaning men enough, who have said that
the only cure for the world's quarrelling and selfishness was to take all children away from
their parents, and bring them up in large public schools; ay, and even to try plans which are
sinful, foul, and wicked, all in order to prevent parents knowing which were their own children,
that they might care for all the children in the parish as much as if they were their own.

A foolish plan, my friends, and for this one reason, that it is driving out one evil by a still
greater one.  It destroys the root to get the fruit; by destroying family life, and love, and
obedience, to get at the communion of saints, or rather at some ghost of it.  Now, the ancient
institution of godfathers and godmothers would, it seems to me, if it were carried out honestly
and really, do for us what we certainly have not done for ourselves as yet, and bind us all
together as one family.  It would do all the good which those fanciful philosophers of whom
I first spoke, have dreamt, without any of the evil; and it would do it because it goes simply
on the belief that the foundation is already laid, and that that foundation is Christ.  It
says, because this child is not merely the child of his father and mother, but the child of
God, the universal Father, therefore other people besides his parents have an interest in him:
all who are children of God as well as he have an interest in him; for they are all his brothers,
and have a brother's interest in his welfare.  Because this child is not merely a member of
the family whose surname he bears, but a member of Christ, a member of God's great adopted
family, in the hearts of every one of whom His only begotten Son, Jesus Christ, is working;
therefore this child ought to be an object of awe, and of interest, and love, and care to every
other member of Christ's Church.  Moreover, the child is an inheritor of a heavenly kingdom--a
kingdom of grace--a kingdom of God,--which is love and justice, and peace, and joy in the Holy
Spirit--all personal, spiritual, heavenly, God-given graces;--and he cannot have them without
being a blessing to all around him; and he cannot be without them, without being a curse to
all around him.  If, in after life, when he comes to be confirmed, he claims his inheritance
in this heavenly kingdom, he will be full of love, justice, peace, joy in the Holy Spirit.
If he refuses to claim his inheritance, and despises his heavenly birthright, and lives as
if he were a mere earthly creature, only to please himself, and help himself, he will not be
full of those graces.  And what then?  That he will be full of their opposites, of course.
If he has not love, he will be unloving, selfish, hard, cold--to you and yours.  If he has
not justice he will be unjust--to you and yours.  If he is not at peace he will be at war,
quarrelling, grudging, envying, backbiting--you and yours.  If he has not joy in the Holy Spirit,
he will have joy in an unholy spirit, for he must have joy in some spirit; he must take pleasure
in some sort of way of thinking and feeling, and some sort of life--in short, in some sort
of spirit; and whatsoever is not holy is unholy, whatsoever is not good is bad, whatsoever
is not of God's Holy Spirit is of the Devil;--and therefore, if the child as he grows up has
not joy in the Holy Spirit, and does not enjoy doing right and pleasing God, and being like
the Lord Jesus Christ, then he will enjoy doing wrong, and pleasing himself, and being unlike
the Lord Jesus Christ; and so he will set a bad example, and be a temptation to all young people
of his own age, ready to lead them into sin, and draw them away to those sinful and unholy
pleasures in which he takes delight,--whether it be to rioting and drinking, or to uncleanness
and unchastity, or to sneering and laughing at godliness, and at good people.  And that, as
you know by experience, may be the worse for you and the worse for your children.  Is that
the sort of young person with whom you would wish to see your children keeping company?  Is
that the sort of young person next door to whom you would wish to live?  Is not such a person
a curse, just because he is a person, a spiritual being with an evil spirit in him, which can
harm you, and tempt you, and act on you for evil; just as if he had been a righteous person,
with the holy and good Spirit in him, he would have helped you, and taught you, and worked
on you for good?  But so it is:  we are members one of another, and if one member goes wrong,
and gets diseased, and suffers, all the other members are sure to suffer more or less with
it, sooner or later:  you feel it so in your bodies--be sure it is so in God's church.  But
if one member is sound and healthy, all the other members must and will be the better for its
health, and rejoice with it, and be able to do their own work the more freely, and strongly,
and heartily.

Just think for yourselves; consider, you who are grown up, and have had experience of life,
the harm you have known one bad man do, the sorrow he will cause, even to people who never
saw him; and the good which you have seen one good man, not merely do with his own hands, but
put into other people's hearts by his example.  Is not both the good and the harm which is
done on earth like the ripple of a stone dropt into water, which spreads and spreads for a
vast distance round, however small the stone may be?  Indeed, bold as it may seem to say it,
I believe that, if we could behold all hearts as the Lord Jesus does, we should find that there
never was a good man but that the whole of Christendom, perhaps all mankind, was sooner or
later, more or less, the better for him; and that there never was a bad man but that all Christendom,
perhaps all mankind, was the worse for him.  So fully and really true it is in everyday practice,
that we are members one of another.

Now this is the principle on which the Church acts.  For the little unconscious infant is treated
as what it is, a most solemn and important person, who has other relations beside its father
and mother, as a person who is the brother of all the people round it, and of all the Church
of God, and who, too, may hereafter do to them boundless good or harm, and they to it.

Therefore we must have some persons to bear witness of that, to remind the child himself, and
the whole Church, that he is not merely a soul by itself to be saved, but that he is a brother,
a member of a family; that he is bound to that family henceforth, for good and for evil.  And
this the godfathers and godmothers do:  they represent and stand in the place of the whole
Church.  In one sense, every Christian who meets that child through life, or hears of it, ought
to behave, as far as he can, as its godfather; ought to help and improve it if he can.  But
what is everybody's business, says the proverb, is nobody's business; and therefore these godfathers
and godmothers are called out from the rest, as examples to the rest, to watch over the child,
and to help and advise its father and mother in guiding and training it:  but not by interfering
with a parent's rights, God forbid! or by drawing away the child's affections from its own
flesh and blood; for if a child be not taught first to honour its father and mother, there
is little use in teaching it anything else whatsoever; and a godfather's first duty is to see
that his godchild obeys its earthly parents for the Lord's sake, for that is right, and God's
will, whatever else is not.

Now just conceive--I am sure that you easily may--what a blessing to this parish, or this part
of the country, it would be, were the duties of godfathers really carried out and practised.
Every child, beside his father and mother, would have some two or three elder friends at least,
whom he had known from his childhood, whom he could trust, to whom he could go in trouble as
to his own flesh and blood.  The orphan would have, if not relations, still godparents, to
comfort and protect him.  No one could go abroad without meeting, if not a godparent, yet the
godparent or godchild of a friend or a relation; someone, in short, who had an interest in
him, and he in them.  All would be bound together in threefold cords of interest and affection.
How many spites, family quarrels, mistakes, and ignorances about each other would be done away,
if people would but thus simply enter into that communion of saints to which, by right, they
belong, and bear each other's burdens, and so fulfil the law of Christ.--Unless you think that
men are such ill-conditioned creatures that the less they mix with each other the better. 
I do not.

And as for what fruit will spring from it, I have seen, by experience, the blessing of godfathership
and godmothership, where it is really carried out; how it will knit together, in sacred bonds
of friendship, not merely the children, but the grown persons of different families, and give
them a fellow-feeling, a mutual interest, which will prevent a hundred quarrels and coldnesses
among frail human creatures.  And to those who are childless themselves, what a blessing to
have their love and self-sacrifice called out, by being bound in holy bonds, if not to children
of their own, at least to children of God!--to have young people to care for, to teach, to
guide, and so to win for themselves in the Church of God a name better than that of sons and
daughters.  And have no fear that by bringing your kindness to bear especially upon your godchildren
you will narrow your love, and care less for children in general.  Not so, my friends; you
will find that your love to your godchildren, like love to your own children, will make all
children lovable in your eyes:  you will learn how worthy of your love children are, what capacities
of good there are in them, how truly of such are the kingdom of heaven; and their simplicity
will often teach you more than you can teach them.  Their God-given instincts of right and
wrong, truth and falsehood, which come from the indwelling Word of God, Jesus the Lord, will
often enough shame us, will teach us more and more the depth of that great saying, 'Out of
the mouths of babes and sucklings, Thou, O God, hast perfected Thy praise.'

Now try, I entreat you, all godfathers and godmothers, to carry out these hints of mine, and
so fulfil your duty to your godchildren, sure that you will find it a blessing to yourselves
as well as to them.

After all it is your duty.  But do not let the slandering Devil slander to you that blessed
word, Duty, and make you afraid of it, and shrink from it, as if it meant something burdensome,
and troublesome, and thankless, which you suppose you must do for fear of punishment, while
you have a right to see how little of it you can do, and try to be let off as cheaply as possible.
Beware of that evil spirit, my friends, for he is very near you, and me, and every man, whenever
we think of our duty.  Very near us he is, that evil Jesuit spirit, that spirit of bondage
unto fear, which is continually setting us on to find out with how little service God will
be contented, how human slaves may make the cheapest bargain with some stern taskmaster above,
of whom they dream.  And from that temptation there is no escape, save into the blessed name
of God Himself--our Father.

Our Father!--whenever you think of your duty to God or man, think but of those two words. 
Remember that all duty is duty to a Father; your Father; and such a Father!  Who gave His only
begotten Son to die for you, who showed what He was in that Son--full of goodness, perfectly
loving, perfectly merciful, perfectly just; and then you will not be inclined to ask how little
obedience, how little love, how little service, He will allow you to pay to Him; but how much
He will help you to pay to Him.  Then you will feel that His service is perfect freedom, because
it is service to a Father who loves you, and will help you to do His will.  Then you will feel
that His commandments are not grievous, because they are a Father's commandments, because you
are bound to do them, not by dread and superstition, but by gratitude, honour, affection, respect,
trust. Then you will not be thinking of what punishment will come if you disobey--no, nor of
what reward will come if you obey--but you will be thinking of the commandment itself, and
how to carry it out most perfectly, and let the consequences take care of themselves, because
you know that your Father takes care of them; that He loves you, and therefore what He commands
must be good for you, utterly the best thing for you; that He only gives you a commandment
because it is good for you; that you are made in God's image, and therefore God's will must
be for you the path of life, the only rule by which you can prosper now and for ever.

Do try, now, all you who are godfathers and godmothers, and for once look on your duty in this
light.  Be sure that in trying to do your duty you will bring a blessing on yourselves, because
your duty is to a Father in heaven.  Be sure that, in trying to better your godchildren, you
will better yourselves; in trying to teach them, you will teach yourselves; in trying to bring
them to confirmation, you will indeed confirm, root, and strengthen yourselves the more deeply
in all that is good; because your godchildren are indeed God's children, and whatsoever you
do for them you do for His only begotten Son Jesus Christ, as He Himself says, 'Inasmuch as
ye did it unto one of the least of these little ones, ye did it unto Me.' Do not be afraid
of trying; you will have a hundred reasons for not trying rise in your mind, the Devil will
find you a hundred lying excuses:  'It will be so difficult; and you do not like to interfere
with other people's children; and you have never cared about your godchildren yet, and it will
seem so odd to begin now; and the children may not listen to you; and besides, you do not know
enough to teach them; you are not good scholar enough, good liver enough, you can't preach
where you don't practice.'  Oh, how ready the Devil is to help a man to excuses for not doing
his duty; how careful he is to keep out of a man's mind the one thought which would sweep all
those excuses to the wind--the thought that this same duty, which he is trying to make look
so ugly, is duty to a loving Father. Dan, alongside, fall. Steamer! Presto, them? Was good? Or

Now if you look at the greater number of religious books, whether Popish or Protestant, you
will find that in practice the main thing, almost the one thing, which they are meant to do,
is to show the reader how he may escape Hell-torments, and reach Heaven's pleasures after he
dies:  not how he may do his Duty to God and his neighbour. They speak of that latter, of course:
they could not be Christian books at all, thank God, without doing so; but they seem to me
to tell men to do their Duty, not simply because it is right, and a blessing in itself, and
worth doing for its own sake, but because a man may gain something by it after he dies.  Therefore,
to help their readers to gain as much as possible after they die, they are not content with
the plain Duty laid down in the Bible and in the Catechism, but require of men new duties over
and above; which may be all very good if they help men to do their real Duty, but are simply
worth nothing if they do not.

Let me explain myself.  I said just now that superstition means anxiety about what will happen
to us after we die.  But people commonly understand by superstition, religious ceremonies,
like the Popish ones, which God has not commanded.  And that is not a wrong meaning either;
for people take to these ceremonies from over- anxiety about the next life.  The one springs
out of the other; the outward conduct out of the inward fear; and both spring alike out of
a false notion of God, which the Devil (whose great aim is to hinder us from knowing our Father
in Heaven) puts into men's minds.  Man feels that he is sinful and unrighteous; the light of
Christ in his heart shows him that, and it shows him at the same time that God is sinless and
righteous.  'Then,' he says, 'God must hate sin;' and there he says true.  Then steps in the
slanderer, Satan, and whispers, 'But you are sinful; therefore God hates you, and wills you
harm, and torture, and ruin.'  And the poor man believes that lying voice, and will believe
it to the end, whether he be Christian or heathen, until he believes the Bible and the Sacraments,
which tell him, 'God does not hate you:  He hates your sins, and loves you; He wills not your
misery but your happiness; and therefore God's will, yea, God's earnest endeavour, is to raise
you out of those sins of yours, which make you miserable now, and which, if you go on in them,
must bring of themselves everlasting misery to you.' Of themselves; not by any arbitrary decree
of God (whereof the Bible says not one single word from beginning to end), that He will inflict
on you so much pain for so much sin:  but by the very nature of sin; for to sin is to be parted
from God, in whose presence alone is life, and therefore sin is, to be in death.  Sin is, to
be at war with God, who is love and peace; and therefore to be in lovelessness, hatred, war,
and misery.  Sin is, to act contrary to the constitution which God gave man, when He said,
'Let us make man in our image, after our likeness;' and therefore sin is a disease in human
nature, and like all other diseases, must, unless it is checked, go on everlastingly and perpetually
breeding weakness, pain and torment.  And out of that God is so desirous to raise you, that
He spared not His only begotten Son, but freely gave Him for you, if by any means He might
raise you out of that death of sin to the life of righteousness--to a righteous life; to a
life of Duty--to a dutiful life, like His Son Jesus Christ's life; for that must go on, if
you go on in it, producing in you everlastingly and perpetually all health and strength, usefulness
and happiness in this world and all worlds to come.

But men will not hear that voice.  The fact is, that simply to do right is too difficult for
them, and too humbling also.  They are too proud to like being righteous only with Christ's
righteousness, and too slothful also; and so they go about like the old Pharisees, to establish
a righteousness of their own; one which will pamper their self-conceit by seeming very strange,
and farfetched, and difficult, so as to enable them to thank God every day that they are not
as other men are; and yet one which shall really not be as difficult as the plain homely work
of being good sons, good fathers, good husbands, good masters, good servants, good subjects,
good rulers.  But by this they deny the righteousness of God; for they make out that he has
not behaved righteously and justly to men, nor showed them what is good, but has left them
to find it out or invent it for themselves.

And is it not, on the other hand, establishing a righteousness of one's own, to say that God
requires of us belief in certain doctrines about election, and 'forensic justification,' and
'sensible conversion,' and certain 'frames and feelings and experiences;' and that without
all these a man has no right to expect anything but endless torture; and all the while to say
little or nothing about God's requiring of men the Ten Commandments?  For my part, I am equally
shocked and astonished at the doctrine which I have heard round us here--openly from some few,
and in practice from more than a few--that because the Ten Commandments are part of the Law,
they are done away with, because we are not now under the Law but under Grace.  What do they
mean?  Is it not written, that not one jot or tittle of the Law shall fail; and that Christ
came, not to destroy the Law, but to fulfil it?  What do they mean?  That it was harm to break
the Ten Commandments before Christ came, but no harm to break them now?  Do they mean that
Jews were forbid to murder, steal, and commit adultery, but that Christians are not forbidden?
One thing I am afraid they do mean, for I see them act up to it steadily enough.  That Jews
were forbidden to covet, but that Christians are not; that Jews might not commit fornication,
but Christians may; that Jews might not lie, but Christians may; that Jews might not use false
weights and measures, or adulterate goods for sale, but that Christians may.  My friends, if
I am asked the reason of the hypocrisy which seems the besetting sin of England, in this day;--if
I am asked why rich men, even high religious professors, dare speak untruths at public meetings,
bribe at elections, and go into parliament each man with a lie in his right hand, to serve
neither God nor his country, but his political party and his religious sect, by conduct which
he would be ashamed to employ in private life;--if I am asked why the middle classes (and the
high religious professors among them, just as much as any) are given over to cheating, coveting,
puffing their own goods by shameless and unmanly boasting, undermining each other by the dirtiest
means, while the sons of religious professors, both among the higher and the middle classes,
seem just as liable as any other young men to fall into unmanly profligacy;--if I am asked
why the poor profess God's gospel and practise the Devil's works; and why, in this very parish
now, there are women who, while they are drunkards, swearers, and adulteresses, will run anywhere
to hear a sermon, and like nothing better, saving sin, than high-flown religious books;--if
I am asked, I say, why the old English honesty which used to be our glory and our strength,
has decayed so much of late years, and a hideous and shameful hypocrisy has taken the place
of it, I can only answer by pointing to the good old Church Catechism, and what it says about
our duty to God and to our neighbour, and declaring boldly, 'It is because you have forgotten
that.  Because you have despised that.  Because you have fancied that it was beneath you to
keep God's plain human commandments.  You have been wanting to "save your souls," while you
did not care whether your souls were saved alive, or whether they were dead, and rotten, and
damned within you; you have dreamed that you could be what you called "spiritual," while you
were the slaves of sin; you have dreamed that you could become what you call "saints," while
you were not yet even decent men and women.'

And so all this superstition has had the same effect as the false preaching in Ezekiel's time
had.  It has strengthened the hands of the wicked, that he should not turn from his wicked
way, by promising him life; and it has made the heart of the righteous sad, whom God has not
made sad.  Plain, respectable, God-fearing men and women, who have wished simply to do their
duty where God has put them, have been told that they are still unconverted, still carnal--
that they have no share in Christ--that God's Spirit is not with them--that they are in the
way to endless torture:  till they have been ready one minute to say, 'Let us eat and drink,
for to-morrow we die'--'Surely I have cleansed my hands in vain, and washed my heart in innocency;'
and the next minute to say, with Job, angrily, 'Though I die, thou shalt not take my righteousness
from me!  You preachers may call me what names you will; but I know that I love what is right,
and wish to do my duty;' and so they have been made perplexed and unhappy, one day fancying
themselves worse than they really were, and the next fancying themselves better than they really
were; and by both tempers of mind tempted to disbelieve God's Gospel, and throw away the thought
of vital religion in disgust.

And now people are raising the cry that Popery is about to overrun England.  It may be so,
my friends.  If it is so, I cannot wonder at it; if it is so, Englishmen have no one to blame
but themselves. And whether Popery conquers us or not, some other base superstition surely
will conquer us if we go on upon our present course, and set up any new-fangled, self-invented
righteousness of our own, instead of the plain Ten Commandments of God.  For I tell you plainly
they are God's everlasting law, the very law of liberty, wherewith Christ has made us free;
and only by fulfilling them, as Christ did, can we be free--free from sin, the world, the flesh,
and the Devil.  For to break them is to sin:  and whosoever commits sin is the slave of sin;
and whosoever despises these commandments will never enjoy that freedom, but be entangled again
in the yoke of bondage, and become a slave, if not to open and profligate sins, still surely
to an evil and tormenting conscience, to superstitious anxieties as to whether he shall be
saved or damned, which make him at last ask, 'Wherewithal shall I come before the Lord?  Will
the Lord be pleased with this, that and the other fantastical action, or great sacrifice of
mine?' or at last, perhaps, the old question, 'Shall I give my firstborn for my transgression,
the fruit of my body for the sin of my soul?  Shall I cheat my own family, leave my property
away from my children, desert them to shut myself up in a convent, or to attempt some great
religious enterprise?'--Things which have happened a thousand times already, and worse, far
worse, than them; things which will happen again, and worse, far worse than them, as soon as
a hypocritical generation is seized with that dread and terror of God which is sure to arise
in the hearts of men who try to invent a righteousness of their own, and who forget what God's
righteousness is like, and who therefore forget what God is like, and who therefore forget
what God's name is, and who therefore forget that Jesus Christ is God's likeness, and that
the name of God is 'Love.'

Now, I say that the Church Catechism, from beginning to end, is the cure for this poison, and
in no part more than where it tells us our duty to God and our neighbour; and that it does
carry out the meaning of the text as no other writing does, which I know of, save the Bible only.

For what says the text?

'He hath showed thee, O man, what is good.'

Who has showed thee?  Who but this very God, from whom thou art shrinking; to whom thou art
looking up in terror, as at a hard taskmaster, reaping where He has not sown, who willeth the
death of a sinner, and his endless and unspeakable torment?  The very God whom thou dreadest
has stooped to save and teach thee.  He hath sent His only begotten Son to thee, to show thee,
in the person of a man, Jesus Christ, what a perfect man is, and what He requires of thee to
be.  This Lord Jesus is with thee, to teach thee to live by faith in thy heavenly Father, even
as He lived, and to be justified thereby, even as He was justified by being declared to be
God's well-beloved Son, and by being raised from the dead.  He will show thee what is good;
He has shown thee what is good, when He showed thee His own blessed self, His story and character
written in the four Gospels.  This is thy God, O man! from whose face thou desirest to flee away.

Next, 'He hath showed thee, O man.'  Not merely, 'He hath showed thee, O deep philosopher,
or brilliant genius;'--not merely, 'He hath showed thee, O eminent saint, or believer who hast
been through many deep experiences:' but, 'He hath showed thee, O man.' Whosoever thou art,
if thou be a man, subsisting like Jesus Christ the Son of Man, of a reasonable soul and human
flesh; thou labourer at the plough, tradesman in thy shop, soldier in the battle-field, poor
woman working in thy cottage, God hath showed thee, and thee, and thee, what is good, as surely
and fully as He has shown it to scholars and divines, to kings and rulers, and the wise and
prudent of the earth.

And He hath showed thee; not you.  Not merely to the whole of you together; not merely to some
of you so that one will have to tell the other, and the greater part know only at second-hand
and by hearsay:  but He hath showed to thee, to each of you; to each man, woman, and child,
in this Church, alone, privately, in the depths of thy own heart, He hath showed what is good.
He hath sent into thine heart a ray of The Light who lighteth every man who comes into the
world.  He has given to thy soul an eye by which to see that Light, a conscience which can
receive what is good, and shrink from what is evil; a spiritual sense, whereby thou canst discern
good and evil. That conscience, that soul's eye of thine, God has regenerated, as He declares
to thee in baptism, and He will day by day make it clearer and tenderer by the quickening power
of His Holy Spirit; and that Spirit will renew Himself in thee day by day, if thou askest Him,
and will quicken and soften thy soul more and more to love what is good, and strengthen it
more and more to hate and fly from what is evil.

Next, 'He hath showed thee, O man, what is GOOD.'  Not merely what will turn away God's punishments,
and buy God's rewards; not merely what will be good for thee after thou diest:  but what is
good, good in itself, good for thee now, and good for thee for ever; good for thee in health
and sickness, joy and sorrow, life and death; good for thee through all worlds, present and
to come; yea, what would be good for thee in hell, if thou couldst be in hell and yet be good.
Not what is good enough for thy neighbours and not good enough for thee, good enough for sinners
and not good enough for saints, good enough for stupid persons and not good enough for clever
ones; but what is good in itself and of itself.  The one very eternal and absolute Good which
was with God, and in God, and from God, before all worlds, and will be for ever, without changing
or growing less or greater, eternally The Same Good.  The Good which would be just as good,
and just, and right, and lovely, and glorious, if there were no world, no men, no angels, no
heaven, no hell, and God were alone in his own abyss.  That very good which is the exact pattern
of His Son Jesus Christ, in whose likeness man was made at the beginning, God hath showed thee,
O man; and hath told thee that it is neither more nor less than thy Duty, thy Duty as a man;
that thy duty is thy good, the good out of which, if thou doest it, all good things such as
thou canst not now conceive to thyself, must necessarily spring up for thee for ever; but which
if thou neglectest, thou wilt be in danger of getting no good things whatsoever, and of having
all evil things, mishap, shame, and misery such as thou canst not now conceive of, spring up
for thee necessarily for ever.

This seems to me the plain meaning of the text, interpreted by the plain teaching of the rest
of Scripture.  Now see how the Catechism agrees with this.

It takes for granted that God has showed the child what is good: that God's Spirit is sanctifying
and making good, not only all the elect people of God, but him, that one particular child;
and it makes the child say so.  Therefore, when it asks him, 'What is thy duty to God and to
thy neighbour?' it asks him, 'My child, thou sayest that God's Spirit is with thee, sanctifying
thee and showing thee what is good, tell me, therefore, what good the Holy Spirit has showed
thee?--tell me what He has showed thee to be good, and therefore thy duty?'

But some may answer, 'How can you say that the Holy Spirit teaches the children their Duty,
when it is their schoolmaster, or their father, who teaches them the Ten Commandments and the
Catechism?'

My friends, we may teach our children the Ten Commandments, or anything else we like, but we
cannot teach them that that is their duty.  They must first know what Duty means at all, before
they can learn that any particular things are parts of their Duty.  And, believe me, neither
you nor I, nor all the men in the world put together, no, nor angel, nor archangel, nor any
created being, nor the whole universe, can teach one child, no, nor our own selves, the meaning
of that plain word DUTY, nor the meaning of those two plain words, I OUGHT.  No; that simple
thought, that thought which every one of us, even the most stupid, even the most sinful has
more or less, comes straight to him from God the Father of Lights, by the inspiration of the
Holy Spirit of God, the Spirit of Duty, Faith, and Obedience.

For mind--when you teach a child, 'If you do this wrong thing-- stealing, for instance--God
will punish you:  but if you are honest, God will reward you,' you are not teaching the child
that it is his Duty to be honest, and his Duty not to steal.  You are teaching him what is
quite right and true; namely, that it is profitable for him to be honest, and hurtful to him
to steal:  but you are not teaching him as high a spiritual lesson as any soldier knows when
he rushes upon certain death, knowing that he shall gain nothing, and may lose everything thereby,
but simply because it is his Duty.  You are only enticing your child to do right, and frightening
him from doing wrong; quite necessary and good to be done:  but if he is to be spiritually
honest, honest at heart, honest from a sense of honour, and not of fear; in one word, if he
is to be really honest at all, or even to try to be really honest, something must be done to
that child's heart which nothing but the Spirit of God can do; he must be taught that it is
his DUTY to be honest; that honesty is RIGHT, the perfectly right, and proper, and beautiful
thing for him and for all beings, yea, for God Himself; he must be taught to love honesty,
and whatsoever else is right, for its own sake, and therefore to feel it his Duty.

And I say that God does that by your children.  I say that we cannot watch our children without
seeing that, though there is in them, as in us, a corrupt and wilful flesh, which tempts them
downward to selfish and self-willed pleasures:  yet there is in them generally, more than in
us their parents, a Spirit which makes them love and admire what is right, and take pleasure
in it, and feel that it is good to be good, and right to do right; which makes them delight
in reading and hearing of loving, and right, and noble actions; which makes them shocked, they
hardly know why, at bad words, and bad conduct, and bad people.  And woe to those who deaden
that tenderness of conscience in their own children, by their bad examples, or by false doctrines
which tell the children that they are still unregenerate, children of the Devil, not yet Christians;
and who so put a stumbling-block in the way of Christ's little ones, and do despite to the
Spirit of Grace by which they are sealed to the day of redemption.  Alas! it is neither natural
nor easy, and they will find out that too soon by sad experience:  but still, the Divine Light
is there, the sense of duty is in their minds, and the law of God is written in their hearts
by the Holy Spirit of God, who is sanctifying them, not merely by teaching them to hope for
heaven, or to dread hell, but by showing them what is good.

And herein, I say, the simple and noble old Church Catechism, by faith in God's Spirit, does
indeed perfect praise out of the mouths of babes.  Without one word about rewards or punishments,
heaven or hell, it begins to talk to the child, like a true English Catechism as it is, about
that glorious old English key word, DUTY.  It calls on the child to confess its own duty, and
teaches it that its duty is something most human, simple, everyday, commonplace, if you will
call it so.  I rejoice that it is commonplace; I rejoice that in what it says about our duty
to God, and to our neighbour, it says not one word about those counsels of perfection, or those
frames and feelings, which depend, believe me, principally on the state of people's bodily
health, on the constitution of their nerves, and the temper of their brain:  but that it requires
nothing except what a little child can do as well as a grown person, a labouring man as well
as a divine, a plain farmer as well as the most refined, devout, imaginative lady.

In a word, to be perfect, even as their Father in heaven is perfect. To do justly, because
God is just, faithful, and true, rewarding every man according to his works, and no partial
accepter of persons; so that in every nation he that feareth God and worketh righteousness
is accepted by Him.

To love mercy, because God loves mercy; to be merciful, because our Father in heaven is merciful;
because He willeth not the death of a sinner, but rather that he should turn from his wickedness
and live; because God came to seek and to save that which is lost, and is good to the unthankful
and the evil; and because God so loved sinful man, that when man hated God, God's answer to
man's hate, God's vengeance upon man's rebellion, was, to send His only-begotten Son, that
whosoever believed in Him should not perish, but have everlasting life.

And to walk humbly with your God, because--and what shall I say now? Does God walk humbly?
Can there be humility in God?  Can God obey? And yet it must be so.  If, as is most certain
from Holy Scripture, man, as far as he is what man ought to be, is the image and glory of God;
if man's justice ought to be a copy of God's justice, and man's mercy a copy of God's mercy,
and all which is good in man a copy of something good in God:  if, as is most certain, all
good on earth is God's likeness, and only good because it is God's likeness, and is given by
God's Spirit,--then our walking humbly with God, if it be good, must be a copy of something
in God.  But of what?

That, my friends, is a question which can never be answered but by those who believe in the
mystery of the ever-blessed Trinity, The Father, The Son, and The Holy Ghost.  It is too solemn
and great a matter to be spoken of hastily at the end of a sermon.  I will tell you what little
I seem to see of it next Sunday, with awe and trembling, as one who enters upon holy ground.
But this I will tell you, to bear in mind meanwhile, that if you wish to know or to do what
is right, you must firmly believe and bear in mind this,--that God's justice is exactly like
what would be just in you and me, without any difference whatsoever:  that God's mercy is exactly
like what would be merciful in you and me; and that, as I hope to show you next Sunday, God's
humility, wonderful as it may seem, is exactly like what would be humble in you and me.  For
I warn you, that if you do not believe this, you will be tempted to forget God's righteousness,
and to invent a righteousness of your own, which is no righteousness at all, but unrighteousness.
For there can be but one righteousness--mind what I say--only one righteousness, as there can
be only one truth, and only one reason.  Forget that, and you will be tempted to invent for
yourselves a false justice, which is dishonest and partial; a false mercy, which is cruel;
a false humility, which is vain and self-conceited; and you will be tempted also, as men of
all religions and denominations have been, to impute to God actions, and thoughts, and tempers,
which are (as your own consciences, if you would listen to God's Word in them, would tell you)
unjust, cruel, and proud; and then you will be tempted to say that things are justifiable in
God, which you would not excuse in any other being, by saying:  'Of course it must be right
in Him, because He is God, and can do what He will.'  As if the Judge of all the earth would
not do Right; as if He could be anything, or could do anything, but the Eternal Good which
is His very being and essence, and which He has shown forth in His Son Jesus Christ our Lord,
who went about doing good because God was with Him.  We all know what the good which He did
was like.  Let us believe that God the Father's goodness is the same as Jesus Christ's goodness.
Let us believe really what we say when we confess that Jesus was the brightness of His Father's
Glory, and the express image of His Person.

SERMON VIII.  SONSHIP

John v. 19, 20, 30.

I can of mine own self do nothing:  as I hear, I judge:  and my judgment is just; because I
seek not mine own will, but the will of my Father which is in Heaven.

This, my friends, is why man should walk humbly and obediently with his God; because humility
and obedience are the likeness of the Son of God, who, though He is equal to His Father, yet
to do His Father's will humbled Himself, and took on Him the form of a slave, and though He
is a Son, yet learned obedience by the things which He suffered; sacrificing Himself utterly
and perfectly to do the commands of His Father and our Father, of His God and our God; and
sacrificing Himself to His Father not as a man merely, but as a son; not because He was in
the likeness of sinful flesh, but because He was The Everlasting Son of His Father; not once
only on the cross, but from all eternity to all eternity, the Lamb slain before the foundation
of the world.  This is a great mystery; we may understand somewhat more of it by thinking over
the meaning of those great words, Father and Son.

Now, first, a son must be of the same nature as his father,--that is certain.  Each kind of
animal brings forth after its kind:  the lion begets lions, the sheep, sheep; the son of a
man must be a man, of one substance with his earthly father; and by the same law, the Son of
God must be God.  Take away that notion:  say that the only- begotten Son of God is not very
God of very God, of one substance with His Father, and the word son means nothing.  If a son
be not of the same substance as his father, he is not a son at all.  And more, a perfect son
must be as great and as good as his father, exactly like his father in everything.  That is
the very meaning of father and son; that like should beget like.  Among fallen and imperfect
men, some sons are worse and weaker than their fathers:  but we all feel that that is an evil,
a thing to be sorry for, a sad consequence of our fallen state.  Our reasons and hearts tell
us that a son ought to be equal to his father, and that it is in some way an affliction, almost
a shame, to a father, if his children are weaker or worse than he is.  But we cannot fancy
such a thing in God; the only-begotten perfect Son of the Almighty and perfect Father must
be at least equal to His Father, as great as His Father, as good as His Father; the brightness
of His Father's glory, and the express image of His Father's person.

But there is another thing about father and son which we must look at, and that is this:  a
good son loves and obeys his father, and the better son he is, the more he loves and obeys
his father; and therefore a perfect son will perfectly love and perfectly obey his father.

Now, here is the great difference between animals and men.  Among the higher animals, the mothers
always, and the fathers sometimes, feed, and help, and protect their young:  but we seldom
or never find that young animals help and protect their parents; certainly, they never obey
their fathers when they are full grown, but are as ready to tear their fathers in pieces as
their fathers are to tear them:  so that the love and obedience of full-grown sons to their
fathers is so utterly human a thing, so utterly different from anything we find in the brutes,
that we must believe it to be part of man's immortal soul, part of God's likeness in man.

And in the text our Lord declares that it is so; He declares that His obedience to His Father,
and His Father's love to Him, is the perfect likeness of what goes on between a good son and
a good father among men; only that it is perfect, because it is between a perfect Father and
a perfect Son.

Father and Son!  Let philosophers and divines discover what they may about God, they will never
discover anything so deep as the wonder which lies in those two words, Father and Son.  So
deep, and yet so simple!  So simple, that the wayfaring man, though poor, shall not err therein.
'Who is God?  What is God like?  Where shall we find Him, or His likeness?'--so has mankind
been crying in all ages, and getting no answer, or making answers for themselves in all sorts
of superstitions, idolatries, false philosophies.  And then the Gospel comes, and answers to
every man, to every poor and unlearned labourer:  Will you know the name of God?  It is a Father,
a Son, and a Holy Spirit of love, joy, peace; a Spirit of perfect satisfaction of the Father
in the Son, and perfect satisfaction of the Son with the Father, which proceeds from both the
Father and the Son. With teach of way, will be seldom kindly had those activity of the now to texture to

  Yes, to love
all mankind as ourselves; for though too many of them, alas! are not yet in God's family, and
strangers to His covenant, yet God's will is that they too should come to the knowledge of
the truth; and therefore for them we can pray hopefully and trustfully, 'Lord have mercy on
all men, on Jews, Turks, Infidels, and heretics; and bring them home, blessed Lord, to Thy
flock, that they may be saved and made one fold under one Shepherd, through Jesus Christ our
Lord, in whom Thou hast declared Thy good will to all the children of men.'

This is the right prayer.  That all men may do their duty where God has put them.  That those
who, like the heathen, do not know their duty, may be taught it; that we who do know it, may
have strength to do it.

And therefore it is that the Catechism teaches us the need of prayer, immediately after making
us confess our duty; and therefore it is that it begins by teaching the Lord's Prayer, because
that prayer is the one, of all prayers which ever have been offered upon earth, which perfectly
expresses the duty of man, and man's relation to Almighty God.

It is throughout a prayer for strength.  It confesses throughout what we want strength for,
to what use we are to put God's grace if He bestows it on us.  Our delight in the Lord's Prayer
will depend on what we consider our duty here on earth to be.

If we look upon this earth principally as a place where we are to pray for all the good things
which we can get, our first prayer will be, of course, 'Give us this day our daily bread.'

If we look at this earth principally as a place where we have a chance of being saved from
punishment and torment after we die, then our first prayer will be, 'Forgive us our sins.'
And, in fact, that is all that too many of our prayers now-a-days seem to consist of,-- 'Oh,
my Maker, give me. my daily bread.  Oh, my Judge, forgive me my sins.'  Right prayers enough,
but spoilt by being taken out of their place; spoilt by being prayed before all other prayers;
spoilt, too, by being prayed for ourselves alone, and not for other people also.

But if we believe, as the Bible and the Catechism tell us, that we and all Christian people
are God's children, members of God's family, set on earth in God's kingdom to do His work by
doing our duty, each in that station of life to which God has called us, in the hope of a just
reward hereafter according to our works, then our great desire will be for strength to do our
duty, and the Lord's Prayer will seem to us the most perfect way of asking for that strength;
and if we believe that we are God's children and He our Father, we shall feel sure that we
must get strength from Him, and sure that we must ask for that strength; and sure that He will
give it us if we do ask.

But if His will is to give it us, why ask Him at all?  Why pray at all, if God already knows
our necessities, and is able and willing to supply them?

My friends, the longer I live, the more certain I am that the only reason for praying at all
is because God is our Father; the more certain I am that we shall never have any heart to pray
unless we believe that God is our Father.  If we forget that, we may utter to Him selfish cries
for bread; or when we look at His great power, we may become terrified, and utter selfish cries
to Him not to harm us, without any real shame or sorrow for sin:  but few of us will have any
heart to persevere in those cries.  People will say to themselves, 'If God is evil, He will
not care to have mercy on me: and if He is good, there is no use wearying Him by asking Him
what He has already intended to give me:  why should I pray at all?'

The only answer is, 'Pray, because God is your Father, and you His child.'  The only answer;
but the most complete answer.  I will engage to say, that if anyone here is ever troubled with
doubts about prayer, those two simple words, 'Our Father,' if he can once really believe them
in their full richness and depth, will make the doubts vanish in a moment, and prayer seem
the most natural and reasonable of all acts.  It is because we are God's children, not merely
His creatures, that He will have us pray.  Because He is educating us to know Him; to know
Him not merely to be an Almighty Power, but a living, loving Person; not merely an irresistible
Fate, but a Father who delights in the love of His children, who wishes to shape them into
His own likeness, and make them fellow-workers with Him; therefore it is that He will have
us pray.  Doubtless he could have given us everything without our asking; for He does already
give us almost everything without our asking.  But He wishes to educate us as His children;
to make us trust in Him; to make us love Him; to make us work for Him of our own free wills,
in the great battle which He is carrying on against evil; and that He can only do by teaching
us to pray to Him.  I say it reverently, but firmly.  As far as we can see, God cannot educate
us to know Him, The living, willing, loving Father, unless He teaches us to open our hearts
to Him, and to ask Him freely for what we want, just because He knows what we want already.

If I have not made this plain enough to any of you, my friends, let me go back to the simple,
practical explanation of it which God Himself has given us in those two words--father and child.

Should you like to have a child who never spoke to you, never asked you for anything?  Of course
not.  And why?  'Because,' you would say, 'one might as well have a dumb animal in one's family
instead of a child, if it is never to talk and ask questions and advice.' Most true and reasonable,
my friends.  And as you would say concerning your children, so says God of His.  You feel that
unless you teach your children to ask you for all they want, even though you know their necessities
before they ask, and their ignorance in asking, you will never call out their love and trust
towards you. You know that if you want really to have your child to please and obey you, not
as a mere tame animal, but as a willing, reasonable, loving child, you must make him know that
you are training him; and you must teach him to come to you of his own accord to be trained,
to be taught his duty, and set right where he is wrong:  and even so does God with you.  If
you will only consider the way in which any child must be educated by its human parents, then
you will at once see why prayer to our Heavenly Father is a necessary part of our education
in the kingdom of heaven.

Now the Lord's Prayer, just this sort of prayer, is man's cry to his Heavenly Father to train
him, to educate him, to take charge of him, daily and hourly, body and soul and spirit.  It
is a prayer for grace, for special grace; that is, for help, daily and hourly, in each particular
duty and circumstance; for help from God specially suited to enable us to do our duty.  And
the whole of the prayer is of this kind, and not, as some think, the latter part only.

It is too often said that the three first sentences are not prayers for man, but rather praises
to God.  My friends, they cannot be one without being the other.  You cannot, I believe, praise
God aright without praying for men; you cannot pray for men aright without praising God; at
least, you cannot use the Lord's Prayer without doing both at once, without at once declaring
the glory of God and praying for the welfare of all mankind.

'Hallowed be Thy name.'  Is not that a prayer for men as well as praise to God?  Yes, my friends,
when you say, 'Our Father, hallowed be Thy name,' you pray that all men may come at last to
look up to God as their Father, to love, serve, and obey God as His children; and for what
higher blessing can you pray?  Ay, and you pray, too, that men may learn at last the deep meaning
of that word--father; that they may see how Godlike and noble a trust God lays on them when
He gives them children to educate and make Christian men; you pray that the hearts of all fathers
may be turned to the children, and the hearts of all children to the fathers; you pray for
the welfare, and the holiness, and the peace of every home on earth; you pray for the welfare
of generations yet unborn, when you pray, 'Our Father, hallowed be Thy name.'

'Thy kingdom come.'  Is not that too, if we will look at it steadfastly, prayer for our neighbours,
prayer for all mankind, and still prayer for ourselves; prayer for grace, prayer for the life
and health of our own souls?

'Thy kingdom come.'--That kingdom of the Father which Jesus Christ proved by His works on earth
to be a kingdom of justice and righteousness, of love and fellow-feeling.  When we pray, 'Thy
kingdom come,' it is as if we said, 'Son of God, root out of this sinful earth all self-will
and lawlessness, all injustice and cruelty; root out all carelessness, ignorance, and hardness
of heart; root out all hatred, envy, slander; root them out of all men's hearts; out of my
heart, for I have the seeds of them in me. Make me, and all men round me, day by day, more
sure that Thou art indeed our King; that Thou hast indeed taught us the laws of Thy Father's
kingdom; and that, only in keeping them and loving them is there health, and righteousness,
and safety for any soul of man, for any nation under the sun.'  'Thy will be done;'--no, not
merely 'Thy will be done;' but done 'on earth as it is in heaven;' done, not merely as the
trees and the animals, the wind and clouds, do Thy will, by blindly following their natures,
but done as angels and blessed spirits do it, of their own will.  They obey Thee as living,
willing, loving persons; as Thy sons:  teach us to obey Thee in like manner; lovingly, because
we love Thy will; willingly, because our wills are turned to Thy will; and therefore, oh Heavenly
Father, take charge of these wayward wills and minds of ours, of these selfish, self-willed,
ignorant, hasty hearts of ours, and cleanse them and renew them by Thy Spirit, and change them
into Thy likeness day by day.  Make us all clean hearts, oh God, and renew within us a right
spirit, the copy of Thine own Holy Spirit.  Cast us not away from Thy presence, for from Thee
alone comes our soul's life; take not from us Thy Holy Spirit, who is The Lord and Giver of
Life; whose will is Thy will; who alone can strengthen and change us to do Thy will on earth,
as saints and angels do in heaven, and to be fellow-workers with each other, fellow-workers
with Thee, O God, even as those blessed spirits are who minister day and night to all Thy creatures.

'Give us this day our daily bread.'  People sometimes divide the Lord's Prayer into two parts--the
ascriptions and the petitions--and consider that after we have sufficiently glorified and praised
God in the first three sentences of the prayer, then we are at liberty to begin asking something
for ourselves, and to say 'Give us day by day our daily bread.'  I cannot think so, my friends.
I have been showing you that 'Hallowed be Thy name, Thy kingdom come, Thy will be done,' if
we do but recollect that they are spoken to our Father, are just as much prayers for all mankind,
as they are hymns of honour to God; and so I say of these latter:  'Give us--Forgive us-- Lead
us not--Deliver us'--that if we will but remember that they, too, are spoken to our Father,
we shall find that they are just as much hymns of honour to God as prayers for mankind.

Yes, my friends, when we say, 'Give us this day our daily bread,' we do indeed honour God and
the name of God.  We declare that He is Love, that He is The Giver, The absolutely and boundlessly
generous and magnanimous Being.  And what higher glory and honour or praise can we ascribe,
even to God Himself, than to say that of Him?  Next, we pray not for ourselves only, but for
our neighbours; for England, for Christendom, for the heathen who know not God, and for generations
yet unborn.  We pray that God would so guide, and teach, and preserve the children of men,
as to enable them to fulfil in every country and every age the work which He gave them to do,
when He said, 'Be fruitful, and multiply, and fill the earth, and subdue it.'  We know that
our Father has commanded us to labour.  We know that our Father has so well ordered this glorious
earth, that whosoever labours may reap the just fruit of his labour; therefore we pray that
God would prosper our righteous plans for earning our own living.  We pray to Him not only
so to order the earth that it may bring forth its fruits in due season, but that men may be
in a fit state to enjoy those fruits, that God may not be forced for their good to withhold
from them blessings which they might abuse to their ruin.  But we pray, also, 'Give us:' not
me only, but us; and therefore we pray that He would prosper our neighbour's plans as well
as ours.  So we confess that we believe God to be no respecter of persons; we confess that
we believe He will not take bread out of others' mouths to give it to us; we declare that God's
curse is on all selfishness and oppression of man by man; we renounce our own selfishness,
the lust which our fallen nature has to rise upon others' fall, and say, 'Father, we are all
children at Thy common table.  Thou alone canst prosper the richest and the wisest; Thou alone
canst prosper the poorest and the weakest; Thou wilt do equal justice to all some day, and
we confess that Thou art just in so doing; we only ask Thee to do it now, and to give us and
all mankind that which is good for them.'

Thus we pray not for this generation only, but for generations yet unborn; not for this nation
of England only, but for heathens and savages beyond the seas.  When we say, 'Give us our daily
bread,' we pray for every child here and on earth, that he may receive such an education as
may enable him to get his daily bread.  We pray for learned men in their studies, that they
may discover arts and sciences which shall enrich and comfort nations yet unborn.  We pray
for merchants on the seas, that they may discover new markets for trade, new lands to colonize
and fill with Christian men, and extend the blessings of industry and civilization to the savage
who lives as the beasts which perish and dwindles down off the face of the earth by famine,
disease, and war, the victim of his own idleness, ignorance, and improvidence.

And all the while we are praying for the widow and the orphan, that God would send them friends
in time of need; for the houseless wanderer, for the shipwrecked sailor, for sick persons,
for feeble infants, that God would send help to them who cannot help themselves, and soften
our hearts and the hearts of all around us, that we may never turn our faces away from any
poor man, lest the face of the Lord be turned away from us.

So far we have been praying to our Heavenly Father, first as a Father, then as a King, then
as an Inspirer, then as a Giver; and next we pray to Him as a Forgiver--'Forgive us our trespasses.'
We have been confessing in these four petitions what God's goodwill to man is; what God wishes
man to be, how man ought to live and believe.  And then comes the recollection of sin.  We
must confess what God's law is before we can confess that we have broken it; and now we do
confess that we have broken it.  We know that God is our Father.  How often have we forgotten
that He is a father; how often have we forgotten to be good fathers ourselves.

We are in God's kingdom.  How often have we behaved as if we were our own kings, and had no
masters over us but our own fancies, tempers, appetites!  We are to do His will on earth as
it is done in heaven.  How have we been doing our own will!--pleasing ourselves, breaking loose
from His laws, trying to do right of our own wills and in our own strength, instead of asking
His Spirit to strengthen, and cleanse, and renew our wills, and so have ended by doing not
the right which we knew to be right, but the wrong which we knew to be wrong.  God is a giver.
How often have we looked on ourselves as takers, and fancied that we must as it were steal
the good things of this world from God, lest He should forget to give us what was fitting!
How often have we forgotten that God gives to all men, as well as to us; and while we were
praying, give me my daily bread, kept others out of their daily bread!

Oh, my friends, we cannot blame ourselves too much for all these sins; we cannot think them
too heinous.  We cannot confess them too openly; we cannot cry too humbly and earnestly for
forgiveness.  But we never shall feel the full sinfulness of sin; we never shall thoroughly
humble ourselves in confession and repentance, unless we remember that all our sins have been
sins against a Father, and a forgiving Father, and that it is His especial glory, the very
beauty and excellence in Him, which ought to have kept us from disobeying Him, that He does
forgive those who disobey Him.

And, lastly, in like manner, when you say, 'Lead us not into temptation, but deliver,' &c.,
you are not only entreating God to lead you, but you are honouring and praising Him, you are
setting forth His glory, and declaring that He is a God who does lead, and a God who does not
leave His poor creatures to wander their own foolish way, but guides men, in spite of all their
sins, full of condescension and pity, care and tender love.  You do not only ask God to deliver
you from evil, but you declare that He is righteous, and hates evil; that He is love, and desires
to deliver you from evil; One who spared not His only-begotten Son, but gave Him freely for
us, to deliver us from evil; and raised Him up, and delivered all power into His hand, that
He might fight His Father's battle against all which is hurtful to man and hateful to God,
till death itself shall be destroyed, and all enemies put under the feet of the Saviour God.

SERMON X.  THE DOXOLOGY

Psalm viii. 1 and sqq.

This is the text which I have chosen to-day, because I think it will help us to understand
the end of the Lord's Prayer, which tells us to say to our Father in Heaven, 'Father, Thine
is the kingdom; Father, Thine is the power; Father, Thine is the glory.'

The man who wrote this psalm had been looking up at the sky, spangled with countless stars,
with the moon, as if she were the queen of them all, walking in her brightness.  He had been
looking round, too, on this wonderful earth, with its countless beasts, and birds, and insects,
trees, herbs, and flowers, each growing, and thriving, and breeding after their kind, according
to the law which God had given to each of them, without any help of man.  And then he had thought
of men, how small, weak, ignorant, foolish, sinful they were, and said to himself, 'Why should
God care for men more than for these beasts, and birds, and insects round?  Not because he
is the largest and strongest thing in the world; for I will consider Thy heavens, even the
work of Thy hands, the moon and the stars, which Thou hast ordained, how much greater, more
beautiful they are than poor human beings.  May not glorious beings, angels, be dwelling in
them, compared to whom man is no better than a beast?'

And yet he says to himself, 'I know that God, though He has put man lower than the angels,
has crowned him with glory and honour.  I know that, whatever glorious creatures may live in
the sun, and moon, and stars, God has given man the dominion and power here, on this world.
I know that even to babes and sucklings God has given a strength, because of His enemies--that
He may silence the enemy and the avenger; and I know that by so doing, God has set His glory
above the heavens, and has shown forth His glory more in these little children, to whom He
gives strength and wisdom, than He has in sun, and moon, and stars.'

Now how is that?  The Catechism, I think, will tell us.  The Doxology, at the end of the Lord's
Prayer, will tell us, if we consider it.

If you will listen to me, I will try and show you what I mean.

Suppose I took one of your children, and showed him that large bright star, which you may see
now every evening, shining in the south-west, and said to him, 'My child, that star, which
looks to you only a bright speck, is in reality a world--a world fourteen hundred times as
big as our world.  We have but one moon to light our earth; that little speck has four moons,
each of them larger than ours, which light it by night.  That little speck of a star seems
to you to be standing still; in reality, it is travelling through the sky at the rate of 25,000
miles an hour.'  What do you think the child's feeling would be?  If he were a dull child,
he might only be astonished; but if he were a sensible and thoughtful child, do you not think
that a feeling of awe, almost of fear, would come over him, when he thought how small and weak
and helpless he was, in comparison of those mighty and glorious stars above his head?

And next, if I turned the child round, and bade him look at that comet or fiery star, which
has appeared lately low down in the north-west, and said, 'My child, that comet, which seems
to you to hang just above the next parish, is really eighty millions of miles off from us.
That bright spot at the lower part of it is a fiery world as large as the moon,--that tail
of fiery light which you see streaming up from it, and which looks a few feet long, is a stream
of fiery vapour, stretching, most likely, hundreds of thousands of miles through the boundless
space.  It seems to you to be sinking behind the trees, so slowly that you cannot see it move.
It is really rushing towards us now, with its vast train of light, at the rate of some eighty
thousand miles an hour.'  And suppose then, if, to make the child more astonished than ever,
I went on--'Yes, my child, every single tiny star which is twinkling over your head is a sun,
a sun as large, or larger than our own sun, perhaps with worlds moving round it, as our world
moves round our sun, but so many millions of miles far off, that the strongest spy-glass cannot
make these stars look any larger, or show us the worlds which we believe are moving round them.'

Do you not think that just in proportion to the child's quickness and understanding, he would
be awed, almost terrified?

 For God forbid that I should
speak thus to any human being, without having first taught him the Lord's Prayer, without first
having taught him to say, 'I believe in Jesus Christ, Very God of Very God, who was born of
the Virgin Mary, and took man's nature on Him;' without having taught him to say, 'Our Father
which art in heaven, Thine is the kingdom, and the power, and the glory, for ever and ever,
Amen.'  So it is, and so let it be:  for so it is well, and so I am safe, sinner and rebel
though I be.

I would not say it, unless I had taught him this; for then I should be speaking the Devil's
words, and doing the Devil's work:  for these are the thoughts of which he always takes advantage,
whenever he finds them in men's hearts; because he is the enemy who hates men, and the avenger
who punishes them for their bad thoughts, by leading them on into dark and fearful deeds; because
he is the Devil, the Slanderer, as his name means, and slanders God to men, and tries always
to make them believe that God does not care for men, and grudges them blessings; in order that
he may make men dread God, and shrink from Him into their own pride, or their own carnal lusts
and fancies.  This--that man is the offspring of God, and has a Father in heaven--is the great
truth which the Devil has been trying to hide from men in every age, and by a hundred different
devices. By making them forget this, he tempted them to worship the creature instead of the
Creator; to pray to sun and moon and stars, to send them fair weather, good crops, prosperous
fortune:  to look up to the heaven above them, and down to the earth beneath their feet, in
slavish dread and anxiety:  and pray to the sun, not to blast them to the seas, not to sweep
them away; to the rivers and springs, not to let them perish from drought; to earthquakes,
not to swallow them up; ay, even to try to appease those dark fierce powers, with whom they
thought the great awful world was filled, by cruel sacrifices of human beings; so that they
offered their sons and their daughters to devils, and burned their own children in the fire
to Moloch, the cruel angry Fire King, whom they fancied was lord of the earthquakes and the
burning mountains.  So did the Canaanites of old, and so did the Jews after them; whensoever
they had forgotten that God was their Father, who had bought them, and that the kingdom, and
the power, and the glory, throughout heaven and earth, were His, then at once they began to
be afraid of heaven and earth, and worshipped Baalim, and Astaroth, and the Host of Heaven,
which were the sun and moon and stars, and Moloch the Fire King, and Thammuz the Lord of the
Spring-time, and with forms of worship which showed plainly enough, either by their cruelty
or their filthy profligacy, who was the author of them, and that man, when he forgets that
heaven and earth belong to his Father, is in danger of becoming a slave to his own lowest lusts
and passions.

And do not fancy, my friends, that because you and I are not likely to worship sun and moon
and stars as the old heathen did, that therefore we cannot commit the same sin as they did.

My friends, I believe that we are in more danger of committing it in England just now than
ever we were; that learned men especially are in danger of so doing, because they know so far
more of the wonders and the vastness of God's creation than the heathens of old knew.

Yes, my friends, this is one meaning, though only one, of St. John's words, 'This is the victory
which overcometh the world, even our faith.'  We all see the world full of pleasant things,
for which we long; of necessary things, too, without which we should starve and die.  And then
the temptation comes to us to snatch at these things for ourselves by any means in our power,
right or wrong; like the dumb animals who break out of their owners' field into the next, if
they do but see better pasturage there, or fight and quarrel between themselves for food, each
trying to get the most for himself and rob his neighbour.  So live the beasts, and so you and
I, and every human being shall be tempted to live, if we follow our natures, if we forget that
we are God's children, in God's kingdom, under the laws of a Heavenly Father, who has shown
forth His own love and justice, His own kingdom, and power, and glory, in the person of the
Lord Jesus Christ.  But if we remember that, if we remember daily that the kingdom, and power,
and glory is our Father's, then we shall neither fear storms and blights, bad crops, or anything
else which is of the earth earthly.  We shall fear nothing of that kind, which can only kill
the body, but only fear the evil Devil, lest, by making us distrust and disobey our Heavenly
Father, he should, after he has killed, destroy both body and soul in hell.  And as long as
we fear him, as long as we renounce him, as long as we trust utterly in our Heavenly Father's
love and justice, and in the love and justice of His dear Son, the Man Christ Jesus, to whom
all power is given in heaven and earth--then out of the youngest child among us will God's
praise be perfected; for the youngest child among us, by faith in God his Father, may look
upon all heaven and earth, and say, 'Great, and wonderful, and awful as this earth and skies
may be, I am more precious in the sight of God than sun, and moon, and stars; for they are
things:  but I am a person, a spirit, an immortal soul, made in the likeness of God, redeemed
into the likeness of God, sanctified into the likeness of God.  This great earth was here thousands
and thousands of years before I was born, and it will be here perhaps millions and millions
of years after I am dead; but it cannot harm me; it cannot kill me.  When earth, and sun, and
stars are past away, I shall live for ever; for I am the immortal child of an Immortal Father,
the child of the everlasting God.  These things He only made:  but me He begot unto everlasting
life, in Jesus Christ my Lord. In Him I have eternal life:  a life which this earth did not
give, and cannot take away; a life which, by the mercy of my Father in heaven, I trust and
hope to be living when sun and earth, stars and comets, are returned again to their dust, and
blotted from the face of heaven.

SERMON XI.  AHAB AND NABOTH

1 Kings xxi. 2, 3.  And Ahab spake unto Naboth, saying, Give me thy vineyard, that I may have
it for a garden of herbs, because it is near unto my house:  and I will give thee for it a
better vineyard than it; or, if it seem good to thee, I will give thee the worth of it in money.

You heard to-day read for the first lesson, the story of Naboth and King Ahab.  Most of you
know it well.  Naboth's vineyard has passed into a proverb for something which we covet.

It is good that it should be so.  We cannot know our Bible too well; we cannot have Bible words
and Bible thoughts too much worked into our ways of talking and thinking about everyday matters.
As far as I can see, the best days of England, the best days of every Christian country of
which I ever read, have been days when men were not ashamed of their Bibles; when they were
ready to live by their Bibles; to ask advice of their Bibles about buying and selling, about
making war and peace, about all the business of life; and were not ashamed to quote texts of
Scripture in the parliament, and in the market, and in the battle-field, as God's law, God's
rule, God's word about the matter in hand, which was, therefore, sure to be the right word
and the right rule.  People are grown ashamed of doing so now-a-days; but that does not alter
the matter one jot.  We may deny God, but He cannot deny Himself.  His laws are everlasting,
and He is ruling and judging us by them now, all day long, just as much as He ruled and judged
those Jews by them of old.  The God of Abraham is our God; the God of Moses is our God; the
God of Ahab and Naboth is our God; neither He nor His government are altered in the least since
their time, and they never will alter for ever, and ever, and ever; and if we do not choose
to believe that now in this life, we shall be made to believe it by some very ugly and painful
schooling in the life to come.

What laws of God, now, can we learn from this story?

First, we may learn what a sacred thing property is.  That a man's possessions (if they be
justly come by) belong to him, in the sight of God as well as in the sight of man, and that
God will uphold and avenge the man's right.

Naboth, you see, stands simply on his right to his own property. 'The Lord forbid it me, that
I should give the inheritance of my fathers unto thee.'  I do not think that he meant that
God had actually forbidden him:  it seems to have been only some sort of oath which he used.
He may certainly have had reasons for thinking it wrong to part with his lands; hurtful, perhaps,
to his family after him.  Yet, as Ahab had promised him a better vineyard for it, or its worth
in money, I cannot help thinking that Naboth's reason was the one which shows on the face of
his words.  It was the inheritance of his fathers, this vineyard.  They had all worked in it,
generation after generation; perhaps, according to the Jewish custom, they were buried somewhere
in it; at least, it had been theirs and now was his; he had worked in it, and played in it--
perhaps since he was a child--and he loved it; it was part and parcel of his father's house
to him, a sacred spot.

And so it should be.  It is a holy feeling which makes a man cling to the bit of land which
he has inherited from his parents, even to the cottage, though it be only a hired one, where
he has lived for many a year, and where he has planted and tilled, perhaps with some that he
loved, who are now dead and gone, or grown up and gone out into the world, till the little
old cottage-garden is full of remembrances to him of past joys and past sorrows.  The feeling
which makes a man cling to his home and to his own land is a good feeling, and breeds good
in the man.  It makes him respect himself; it keeps him from being reckless and unsettled.
It is a feeling which should not be broken through.  It is seldom pleasant to see land change
hands; it is seldom pleasant to see people turned out of their cottages.  It must often be
so, but let it be as seldom as possible.  One likes to see a family take root in a place, and
grow and thrive there, one generation after another; and you will find, my friends, that families
do take root and thrive in a place just in proportion as they fear God and do righteousness.
The Psalms tell you, again and again, that the way to abide in the land, and prosper in it,
is to trust in the Lord and be doing good; and that the wicked are soon rooted out, and their
names perish out of the land. One sees that come true daily.

But to return to Naboth.  He loved his own land, and therefore he had a right to keep it. 
We may say it was but a fancy of his, if he could have a better vineyard, or the worth of it
in money. Remember, at least, that God respected that fancy of his, and justified it, and avenged
it.  When (after Naboth's death) Elijah accused Ahab, in God's name, he put two counts into
the indictment; for Ahab had committed two sins.  'Hast thou killed, and also taken possession?'
Killing was one sin; taking possession was another.

And so Ahab learnt two weighty and bitter lessons.  He learnt that God's Law stands for ever,
though man's law be broken or be forgotten by disuse.  For you must understand, that these
Jews were a free people, even as we are.  They were not like the nations round about them,
or as the Russians are now--slaves to their king, and holding their property only at his will.
The law of Moses had made them a free people, who held their property each man from God, by
God's Law, which had said, 'Thou shalt not steal.  Thou shalt not covet.  Cursed is he who
removes his neighbour's landmark.'  And their kings were bound to govern by Moses' law, just
as our kings and rulers are bound to govern by the old constitutions of England, and to do
equal justice by rich and poor.  But the wicked kings of Israel were trying to break through
that law, and make themselves tyrants and despots, such as the Czar of Russia is now.  First,
Jeroboam began by trying to wean his people from Moses' law, by preventing their going up to
worship at Jerusalem, and making them worship instead the golden calves at Dan and at Bethel.
For he knew that if he could make idolaters of them, he should soon make slaves of them; and
he succeeded; and the kingdom of Israel grew more miserable year by year; and now Ahab, his
wicked successor, was breaking down the laws of property and wrongfully taking away his subjects'
lands.  Perhaps he said in his heart, 'I am king; there is no law stronger than I.  I have
a right to do what I like.'  If he did so, he found that he was mistaken.  He found that though
he forgot Moses' law, God had not; that the law stood there still, because it was founded on
eternal justice, which proceeds for ever out of the mouth of God; and by the Law, which he
had chosen to forget, he was judged; by the Law of God, which deals equal justice to rich and
poor, which is, like God Himself, no acceptor of persons; but says, 'Thou shalt not covet,'
to the king upon his throne as sternly as to the beggar on the dunghill.

And that Law stands still, my friends, doubt it not. Snuff, on down of orlop-hole, dull. "'element

The ace were fence; at hour. He keep to enthusiasm. It was a hour that
he had not have spurt over doubt, he jump himself.



But with a closer knowledge of our fellow-creatures has come toleration, pity, sympathy.  And
as that sympathy has been freely obeyed, it has justified itself more and more.  The more we
have tried to help our fellow-men, the more easy we have found it to help them.  The more we
have trusted them, the more trustworthy we have found them.  The more we have treated them
as human beings, the more humanity we have found in them.  And thus man, in proportion as he
becomes manifest to man, is seen, in spite of all defects and sins, to be hallowed with a light
from God who made him.

And if it has been thus, in the case of God and of humanity, has it not been equally so in
the case of the physical world?  Where are now all those unnatural superstitions--the monkish
contempt for marriage and social life, the ghosts and devils; the astrology, the magic, and
other dreams of which I will not speak here, which made this world, in the eyes of our forefathers,
a doleful and dreadful puzzle; and which made man the sport of arbitrary powers, of cruel beings,
who could torment and destroy us, but over whom we could have no righteous power in return?
Where are all those dark dreams gone which maddened our forefathers into witch-hunting panics,
and which on the Continent created a priestly science of witch-finding and witch-destroying,
the literature whereof (and it is a large one) presents perhaps the most hideous instance known
of human cruelty, cowardice, and cunning?  Where, I ask, are those dreams now?  So utterly
vanished, that very few people in this church know what a great part they played in the thoughts
of our forefathers; how ghosts, devils, witches, magic, and astrology, filled the minds, not
only of the ignorant, but of the most learned, for centuries.

And now, behold, nature being made manifest, is light.  Science has taught men to admire where
they used to dread; to rule where they used to obey; to employ for harmless uses what they
were once afraid to touch; and, where they once saw only fiends, to see the orderly and beneficent
laws of the all-good and almighty God.  Everywhere, as the work of nature is unfolded to our
eyes, we see beauty, order, mutual use, the offspring of perfect Love as well as perfect Wisdom.
Everywhere we are finding means to employ the secret forces of nature for our own benefit,
or to ward off physical evils which seemed to our forefathers as inevitable, supernatural;
and even the pestilence, instead of being, as was once fancied, the capricious and miraculous
infliction of some demon--the pestilence itself is found to be an orderly result of the same
laws by which the sun shines and the herb grows; a product of nature; and therefore subject
to man, to be prevented and extirpated by him, if he will.

Yes, my friends, let us teach these things to our children, to all children.  Let us tell them
to go to the Light, and see their Heavenly Father's works manifested, and know that they are,
as He is, Light.  I say, let us teach our children freely and boldly to know these things,
and grow up in the light of them.  Let us leave those to sneer at the triumphs of modern science,
who trade upon the ignorance and the cowardice of mankind, and who say, 'Provided you make
a child religious, what matter if he does fancy the sun goes round the earth?  Why occupy his
head, perhaps disturb his simple faith, by giving him a smattering of secular science?'

Specious enough is that argument:  but shortsighted more than enough.  It is of a piece with
the wisdom which shrinks from telling children that God is love, lest they should not be sufficiently
afraid of Him; which forbids their young hearts to expand freely towards their fellow-creatures:
which puts into their mouths the watchwords of sects and parties, and thinks to keep them purer
Christians by making them Pharisees from the cradle.

My friends, we may try to train up children as Pharisees:  but we shall discover, after twenty
years of mistaken labour, that we have only made them Sadducees.  The path to infidelity in
manhood is superstition in youth.  You may tell the child never to mind whether the sun moves
round the earth or not:  but the day will come when he will mind in spite of you; and if he
then finds that you have deceived him, that you have even left him in wilful ignorance, all
your moral influence over him is gone, and all your religious lessons probably gone also. 
So true is it, that lies are by their very nature self-destructive.  For all truth is of God;
and no lie is of the truth, and therefore no lie can possibly help God or God's work in any
human soul.  For as the child ceases to respect his teachers he ceases to respect what they
believe.  His innate instinct of truth and honour, his innate longing to believe, to look up
to some one better than himself, have been shocked and shaken once and for all; and it may
require long years, and sad years, to bring him back to the faith of his childhood.  Again
I say it, we must not fear to tell the children the whole truth; in these days above all others
which the world has yet seen.  You cannot prevent their finding out the truth:  then for our
own sake, let us, their authorized teachers, be the first to tell it them.  Let them in after
life connect the thought of their clergyman, their schoolmaster, their church, with their first
lessons in the free and right use of their God-given faculties, with their first glimpses into
the boundless mysteries of art and science.  Let them learn from us to regard all their powers
as their Heavenly Father's gift; all art, all science, all discoveries, as their Heavenly Father's
revelation to men.  Let them learn from us not to shrink from the light, not to peep at it
by stealth, but to claim it as their birthright; to welcome it, to live and grow in it to the
full stature of men--rational, free, Christian English men.  This, I believe, must be the method
of a truly Protestant education.

I said Protestant--I say it again.  What is the watchword of Protestantism?  It is this.  That
no lie is of the truth.  There are those who complain of us English that we attach too high
a value to TRUTH.  They say that falsehood is an evil:  but not so great a one as we fancy.
We accept the imputation.  We answer boldly that there can be no greater evil than falsehood,
no greater blessing than truth; and that by God's help we will teach the same to our children,
and to our children's children.  Free inquiry, religious as well as civil liberty--this is
the spirit of Protestantism.  This our fathers have bequeathed to us; this we will bequeath
to our children;--to know that all truth is of God, that no lie is of the truth.  Our enemies
may call us heretics, unbelievers, rebellious, political squabblers.  They may say in scorn,
You Protestants know not whither you are going; you have broken yourselves off from the old
Catholic tree, and now, in the wild exercise of your own private judgment, you are losing all
that standard of doctrine, all unity of belief.  Our answer will be--It is not so:  but even
if it were so-- even if we did not know whither we were going--we should go forward still.
For though we know not, God knows.  We have committed ourselves to God, the living God; and
He has led us; and we believe that He will lead us.  He has taught us; and we believe that
He will teach us still.  He has prospered us, and we believe that He will prosper us still:
and therefore we will train up our children after us to go on the path which has brought us
hither, freely to use their minds, boldly to prove all things, and hold fast that which is
good; manfully to go forward, following Truth whithersoever she may lead them; trusting in
God, the Father of Lights, asking Him for wisdom, who giveth to all liberally, and upbraideth
not; and it shall be given them.

I have been asked to preach this day for the National Schools of this parish.  I do so willingly,
because I believe that in them this course of education is pursued, that conjoined with a sound
teaching in the principles of our Protestant church, and a wholesome and kindly moral training,
there is free and full secular instruction as far as the ages of the children will allow. 
Were it not the case, I could not plead for these schools; above all at this time, when the
battle between ancient superstition and modern enlightenment in this land seems fast coming
to a crisis and a death struggle.  I could not ask you to help any school on earth in which
I had not fair proof that the teachers taught, on physical and human as well as on moral subjects,
the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help them God.

SERMON XIII.  PROVIDENCE

Matthew vi. 31, 32, 33.  Be not anxious, saying, What shall we eat? or, what shall we drink,
or wherewithal shall we be clothed?

We must first consider carefully what this text really means; what 'taking no thought for the
morrow' really is.  Now, it cannot mean that we are to be altogether careless and imprudent;
for all Scripture, and especially Solomon's Proverbs, give us the very opposite advice, and
one part of God's Word cannot contradict the other.  The whole of Solomon's Proverbs is made
up of lessons in prudence and foresight; and surely our Lord did not come to do away with Solomon's
Proverbs, but to fulfil them.  And more, Solomon declares again and again, that prudence and
foresight are the gifts of God; and God's gifts are surely meant to be used.  Isaiah, too,
tells us that the common work of the farm, tilling the ground, sowing, and reaping, were taught
to men by God; and says of the ploughman, that 'His God doth instruct him to discretion and
doth teach him.'  Neither can God mean us to sit idle with folded hands waiting to be fed by
miracles.  Would He have given to man reason, and skill, and the power of bettering his mortal
condition by ten thousand instructions if He had not meant him to use those gifts? We find
that, at the beginning, Adam is put into the garden, not to sit idle in it, nor to feed merely
on the fruits which fall from the trees, as the dumb animals do, but to dress it, and to keep
it; to use his own reason to improve his own condition, and the land on which God had placed
him.  Was not the very first command given to man to replenish the earth and subdue it?  And
do we not find in the very end of Scripture the Apostles working with their own hands for their
daily bread?

But what use of many words?  It is absurd to believe anything else; absurd to believe that
man was meant to live like the butterfly, flitting without care from flower to flower, and,
like the butterfly, die helpless at the first shower or the first winter's frost.  Whatever
the text means, it cannot mean that.

And it does not mean that.  I suppose, that three hundred years ago (when the Bible was translated
out of the Greek tongue, in which the Apostles wrote, into English), 'taking thought' meant
something different from what it does now:  but the plain meaning of the text, if it be put
into such English as we talk now, is, 'Do not fret about the morrow.  Be not anxious about
the morrow.'  There is no doubt at all, as any scholar can tell you, that that is the plain
meaning of the word in our modern English, and that our Lord is not telling us to be imprudent
or idle, but not to be anxious and fretful about the morrow.

And more, I think if we look carefully at these words, we shall find that they tell us the
very reason why we are to work, and to look forward, and to believe that God will bless our labour.

And what is this reason?  It is this, that we have a Father in heaven; not a mere Maker, not
a mere Master, but a Father.  All turns on that one Gospel of all Gospels, your Father in heaven.
For our Lord seems to me to say, 'Be not anxious for your life, what ye shall eat, or drink,
or wear.  Is not the life more than meat? Has not your Heavenly Father given you a higher life
than the mere life which must be kept up by food, which He has given to the animals?  He has
made you reasonable souls; He has given to you wisdom from His own wisdom, and a share of the
Light which lights every man who comes into the world, the Light of Christ His Son; He has
created you in His own likeness, that like Him you may make things, be makers and inventors,
each in his place and calling, each according to his talents and powers, even as your Heavenly
Father, the Maker and Creator of all things.  And if He has given you all these wonderful powers
of mind and soul, surely He has given you the less blessing, the mere power to earn your own
food?  If He has made you so much wiser than the beasts, surely He has made you as wise as
the beasts.'  'And is not the body more than raiment?'  Has He not given you bodies which can
speak, write, build, work, plant, in a thousand cunning and wonderful ways; bodies which can
do a thousand nobler things than merely keep themselves warm, as the beasts do? Then be sure,
if He has given you the greater power, He has given you the less also.  And as for fine clothes
and rich ornaments, 'Is not the body more than raiment?'  Is not your body a far more beautiful
and nobler thing than all the gay clothes with which you can bedizen it?  If your bodies be
fair, strong, healthy, useful, it matters little what clothes you put upon them.  Why will
you not have faith in your Heavenly Father?  Why will you not have faith in the great honour
which He put on you when He said at first, 'Let us make man in our image, after our likeness,
and let him have dominion over all things on the earth'?  Be sure, that God would not have
made man, and given him all these powers, and sent him upon this earth, unless this earth had
been a right good and fit place for him.  Be sure that if you obey the laws of this earth where
God has put you, you will never need to be anxious or fret; but you will prosper right well,
you and your children after you.  And if God makes the earth work so well that it feeds the
fowls who cannot help themselves, how much more will the earth feed you who can help yourselves,
because God has given you understanding and prudence?  But as for anxiety, fretting, repining,
complaining to God, 'Why hast Thou made me thus?' what use in that? 'Which of you by taking
thought can add one cubit to his stature?' Will all the fretting and anxiety in the world make
you one foot or one inch taller than you are?  Will it make you stronger, wiser, more able
to help yourself?  You are what you are:  you can do what God has given you power to do.  Trust
Him that He has made you strong enough and wise enough to earn your daily bread, and to prosper
right well, if you will, upon this earth which He has made. And why be anxious about clothing?
For the Heavenly Father has knit together the great family of man in one blessed bond of mutual
need and mutual usefulness all over the world; so that no member of it can do without the other,
and each member of it--each individual man--let him work at what thing he will, can make many
times more of that thing than he needs for himself, and so help others while he earns his own
living; and so wealth and comfort ought to increase year by year among the whole family of
men, ay, and would increase, if it were not for sin.  Yes, my friends, if it were not for that
same sin--if it were not that men do not seek first the kingdom of God and His righteousness,
there would be no end, no bound to the wealth, the comfort, the happiness of the children of
men.  Even as it is, in spite of all man's sin, the world does prosper marvellously, miraculously;
in spite of all the waste, destruction, idleness, ignorance, injustice, and folly which goes
on in the world, mankind increases and replenishes the earth, and improves in comfort and in
happiness; in spite of all, God is stronger than the Devil, life stronger than death, wisdom
stronger than folly, order stronger than disorder, fruitfulness stronger than destruction;
and they will be so, more and more, till the last great day, when Christ shall have put all
enemies under His feet, and death is swallowed up in victory, and all mankind is one fold under
one Shepherd, Jesus Christ, the righteous King of all.  But this I can tell you, that these
things are taken from men, instead of being added to them, by their not seeking first God's
kingdom and His righteousness.  I can tell you, as the Prophet does, that it is the sins of
man which withhold good things from him; because though, as the Prophet says in the same place,
God sends the good things, and the former and latter rain in their season, and reserves to
men still the appointed weeks of harvest, yet men will not fear that same Lord their God; and
therefore those good things are wasted, and mankind remains too often miserable in spite of
God's goodness, and starving in the midst of God's plenty.

If you wish to know what I mean, look but once at this present war. I do not complain of the
war.  I honour the war.  I thank God from the bottom of my heart for this great and glorious
victory, and I call on you to thank Him, too, for it.  I am none of those who think war sinful.
I cannot do so, for I swore at my baptism to fight manfully under Christ's banner against the
world, the flesh, and the Devil; and if we cannot reach the Devil and his works by any other
means, we must reach them as we are doing now, by sharp shot and cold steel, and we must hold
it an honourable thing, and few things more honourable on earth, for a man to die fighting
against evil men, and an evil world-devouring empire, like that of Babylon of old, or this
of Russia now, that he may save not merely us who sit here now, but our children's children,
and generations yet unborn, from Russian tyranny, and Russian falsehood, and Russian profligacy,
and Russian superstition.  I say, I do not complain of this war; but I ask you to look at the
mere waste which it brings, the mere waste of God's blessings.  Consider all the skilful men
now employed in making cannon, shot, and powder to kill mortal men, who might every one of
them, in time of peace, have been employed in making things which would feed, and clothe, and
comfort mortal man.  Consider that very powder and shot itself, the fruit of so much labour
and money, made simply to be shot away, once for all, as if a man should spend months in making
some precious vessel, and then dash it to pieces the moment it was made.  Consider that Sevastopol
alone; the millions of money which it must have cost--the stone, the timber, the iron, all
used there--in making a mere robber's den, which might all have been spent in giving employment
and sustenance to whole provinces of poor starving Russians.  Consider those tens of thousands
of men, labouring day and night for months at those deadly earthworks, whose strong arms might
have been all tilling God's earth, and growing food for the use of man.  And then see the waste,
the want, the misery which that one place, Sevastopol, has caused upon God's earth.

And consider, too, the souls of mortal men, who have been wasted there--no man knows how many,
nor will know till the judgment day. Two hundred thousand, at the least, they say, wasted about
that accursed place, within the last twelve months.  Two hundred thousand cunning brains, two
hundred thousand strong right hands, two hundred thousand willing hearts:  what good might
not each of those men have done if he had been labouring peacefully at home, in his right place
in God's family!  What might he not have invented, made, carried over land and sea?  None dead
there but might have been of use in his generation; and doubtless many a one who would have
done good with all his might, who would have been a blessing to those around him; and now what
is left of him on earth but a few bones beneath the sod?  Wasted--utterly wasted!  Oh, consider
how precious is one man; consider how much good the weakest and stupidest of us all might do,
if he set himself with his whole soul to do good; consider that the weakest and stupidest of
us, even if he has no care for good, cannot earn his day's wages without doing some good to
the bodies of his fellow-men; and then judge of the loss to mankind by this one single siege
of one single town; and think how many stomachs must be the emptier, how many backs the barer,
for this one war; and then see how man wastes God's gifts, and wastes most of all that most
precious gift of all, men, living men, with minds, and reasons, and immortal souls.

And whence has all this waste come?  Simply because these Russian rulers have chosen to seek
first, not God's kingdom, but their own. Instead of behaving like God's ministers and God's
stewards, and asking, 'How would God our King have us rule His kingdom?' they have laboured
for their own power, conquering all the nations round them, removing their neighbour's landmark,
and wasting the wealth of their country on armies, and fortresses, and fleets, with which they
intended to conquer more and more of the earth which did not belong to them.  Because, instead
of seeking God's righteousness, and saying to themselves, 'How shall we be righteous, even
as our Heavenly Father is righteous, and how shall we teach this great people to be righteous
likewise?' they have sought their own pleasure, and lived in profligacy, covetous and cheating
almost beyond belief; and instead of behaving righteously to the people, or teaching them to
be righteous, they have crushed down the people, stupefied and corrupted them by slavery, and
maddened them by superstitions which are not the righteousness of God, till they have made
them easy tools in their unjust wars, and are able to drive them, even by force, like sheep
to the slaughter, to die miserably in a cause in which, even if those unhappy slaves conquered,
they would only rivet their own chains more tightly, and put more power into the hands of the
very rulers who are robbing them of their earnings, dishonouring their daughters, and driving
off their sons to die in a foreign land.  Ah, my friends, if these men had but sought first
the kingdom of God and His righteousness; if the great wealth, and the wonderful industry and
prudence of Russia had been but spent in doing justly, and loving mercy, what a rich and honourable
country of brave and industrious Christian men might Russia be; a blessing, and not a curse,
to half the earth of God!

Let us pray that she will become so, some day; and we may have hope for her, for she is but
young, and has time yet for repentance.

But some may say--indeed, we are all ready enough to say--'Then the evil of this war is the
Russians' fault, and not ours; and so in every other case.  In every other evil and misery
they are rather other people's fault than ours.  If we do our duty well enough, and if other
people would but do theirs, all would be well.'

We are all apt to say this in our hearts.  But our Lord does not say so.  His promise is to
all mankind:  but His promise is to each of us also.  When He says, Seek ye first God's kingdom
and righteousness, He speaks to you and to me, to every soul now here. Believe it, my friends.
The more that I see of life, the more I see how much of our sorrow is our own fault; how much
of our happiness is in our own hands; and the more I see how little use there is in finding
fault with this government, or that, the more I see how much use there is in every man's finding
fault with himself, and taking his share of the blame.

I do not doubt that if the whole people of England, for the last forty years, had sought first
God's kingdom and God's righteousness, and said to themselves in every matter, not merely 'What
is profitable for us to do?' but 'What is right for us to do?' we should have been spared the
expenses and the sorrows of this war: but as for blaming our government, my friends,--what
they are we are; we choose them, Englishmen like ourselves, and they truly represent us.  Not
one complaint can we make against them, which we may not as justly make against ourselves;
and if we had been in their places, we should have done what they did; for the seeds of the
same sins are in us; and we yield, each in his own household and his own business, to the same
temptations as they, to the sins which so easily beset Englishmen at this present time.  I
say, frankly, I see not one charge brought against them in the newspapers which might not quite
as justly be brought against me, and, for aught I know, against every one of us here; and while
we are not faithful over a few things, what right have we to complain of them for not having
been faithful over many things?  Believe, rather (I believe it), that if we had been in their
place, we should have done far worse than they; and ask yourselves, 'Do I seek first God's
kingdom and God's righteousness; for if I do not, what right have I to lay the blame of my
bad success on other men's not seeking them?' To each of us, as much as to our government,
or to the Russian empire, is Christ's command; and each of us must take the consequences, if
we break it.  Let us look at ourselves, and mend ourselves, and try whether God's promise will
not hold true for us, each in his station, let the world round us go as it will.  Be sure that
God is just, and that every man bears his own burden:  that the righteous should be as the
wicked, that be far from Thee, O God! Shall not the judge of all the earth do right?  Be sure
that those who trust in Him shall never be confounded, though the earth be moved, and the mountains
carried into the midst of the sea, as it is written, 'Trust in the Lord, and be doing good;
dwell in the land, and work where God has placed thee, and verily thou shalt be fed.'

But have we done so, my friends? have we sought first God's kingdom and His righteousness?
have we not rather forgotten the meaning of the text, and what God's kingdom is, and what His
righteousness is? Do not most people fancy that God's kingdom only means some pleasant place
to which people are to go after they die? and that seeking God's righteousness only means having
Christ's righteousness imputed to us (as they call it), without our being righteous and good
ourselves?  Do not most of us fancy that this very text means, 'Do you take care of your souls,
and God will take care of your bodies; do you see after the salvation of your souls, and God
will see after the salvation of your bodies'? a meaning which, in the first place, is not true,
for God will do no such thing; and all the religion in the world will not prevent a man's having
to work for his daily bread, or pay his debts for him without money; and a meaning which, in
the second place, people themselves do not believe; for religious professors in general now
are just as keen about money as irreligious ones, and even more so; so that covetousness and
cunning, ambition and greediness to rise in life, seem now-a-days to go hand in hand with a
high religious profession; and those who fancy themselves the children of light have become
just as wise in their generation as the children of this world whom they despise.

No, my friends, that is not the meaning of the text; and when I ask you, Have you obeyed the
text? I do not ask you that question; but one which I believe is something far more spiritual
and more deep, something at least which is far more heart-searching, and likely to prick a
man's conscience, perhaps to make him angry with me who ask.

Do you seek first God's kingdom, or your own profit, your own pleasure, your own reputation?
Do you believe that you are in God's kingdom, that He is your King, and has called you to the
station in which you are to do good and useful work for Him upon this earth of His?  Whatever
be your calling, whether you be servant, labourer, farmer, tradesman, gentleman, maid, wife,
or widow, father, son, or husband, do you ask yourself every day, 'Now what are the laws of
God's kingdom about this station of mine? what is my duty here? how can I obey God, and His
laws here, and do what He requires of me, and so be a good servant, a good labourer, a good
tradesman, a good master, a good parish officer, a good wife, a good parent, pleasing to God,
useful to my neighbours and to my countrymen?'  Or do you say to yourselves, 'How can I get
the greatest quantity of money and pleasure out of my station, with the least trouble to myself?'
My dearest friends, ask yourselves, each of you, in which of these two ways do you look at
your own station in life?

And do you seek first God's righteousness?  There can be no mistake as to what God's righteousness
is; for God's righteousness must be Christ's righteousness, seeing that He is the express image
of His Father.  Now do you ask yourselves, 'How am I to be righteous in my station, as Christ
was in His? how can I do my Heavenly Father's will, as Christ did? how can I behave like Christ
in my station? how would the Lord Jesus Christ have behaved, if He had been in my place, when
He was on earth?'  My friends, that is the question, the searching question, the question which
must convince us all of sin, and show us so many faults of our own to complain of, that we
shall find no time to throw stones at our neighbours.  How would the Lord Jesus Christ have
behaved, if He had been in my place when He was upon earth?

My dear friends, till we can all of us answer that question somewhat better than we can now,
we have no need to look as far as Russia, or as our forefathers' mistakes, or our rulers' mistakes,
to find out why this trouble and that trouble come upon us:  for we shall find the reason in
our own selfish, greedy, self-willed hearts.

Oh, my friends, let us each search our own lives, and repent, and amend, and resolve to do
our duty, as sons of God, in the station to which God has called us, by the help of the Spirit
of God, which He has promised freely to those who ask Him.  And now, this day, as we thank
God for this great victory, let us thank Him, not with our lips merely, but with our lives,
by living such lives as He loves to see, such lives as He meant us to live, lives of loyalty
to God, and of usefulness to our brethren, and of industry and prudence in our calling, and
so help forward, each of us, however humble our station, the glory of God; because we shall
each of us, in the cottage and in the field, in the shop and in the mansion, in this our little
parish, and therefore in the great nation of which it is a part, help forward the fulfilment
of those blessed words, Our Father which art in heaven; Thy kingdom come; Thy will be done
on earth as it is in heaven; and therefore, also, the fulfilment of the words which come after
them, and not before them; Give us this day our daily bread.

SERMON XIV.  ENGLAND'S STRENGTH

2 Kings xix. 34.  I will defend this city, to save it for mine own sake.

The first lesson for this morning's service is of the grandest in the whole Old Testament;
grander perhaps than all, except the story of the passage of the Red Sea, and the giving of
the Law on Sinai. It follows out the story which you heard in the first lesson for last Sunday
afternoon, of the invasion of Judea by the Assyrians. You heard then how this great Assyrian
conqueror, Sennacherib, after taking all the fortified towns of Judah, and sweeping the whole
country with fire and sword, sent three of his generals up to the very walls of Jerusalem,
commanding King Hezekiah to surrender at discretion, and throw himself and his people on Sennacherib's
mercy; how proudly and boastfully he taunted the Jews with their weakness; how, like the Russian
emperor now, he called in religion as the excuse for his conquests and robberies, saying, as
if God's blessings were on them, 'Am I now come up without the Lord against this place to destroy
it?  The Lord said to me, Go up against this place to destroy it;' while all the time what
he really trusted in (as his own words showed) was what the Russian emperors trust in, their
own strength and the number of their armies.

Jerusalem was thus in utter need and danger; the vast army of the Assyrians was encamped at
Lachish, not more than ten miles off; and however strong the walls of Jerusalem might be, and
however advantageously it might stand on its high hill, with lofty rocks and cliffs on three
sides of it, yet Hezekiah knew well that no strength of his could stand more than a few days
against Sennacherib's army. For these Assyrians had brought the art of war to a greater perfection
than any nation of the old world:  they lived for war, and studied, it seems, only how to conquer.
And they have left behind them very remarkable proofs of what sort of men they were, of which
I think it right to tell you all; for they are most instructive, not merely because they prove
the truth of Isaiah's account, but because they explain it, and help us in many ways to understand
his prophecies.  They are a number of sculptures and paintings, representing Sennacherib, his
army, and his different conquests, which were painted by his command, in his palace; and having
been lately discovered there, among the ruins of Nineveh, have been brought to England, and
are now in the British Museum, while copies of many of them are in the Crystal Palace.  There
we see these terrible Assyrian conquerors defeating their enemies, torturing and slaughtering
their prisoners, swimming rivers, beating down castles, sweeping on from land to land like
a devouring fire, while over their heads fly fierce spirits who protect and prosper their cruelties,
and eagles who trail in their claws the entrails of the slain.  The very expression of their
faces is frightful for its fierceness; the countenances of a 'bitter and hasty nation,' as
the Prophet calls them, whose feet were swift to shed blood.  And as for the art of war, and
their power of taking walled towns like Jerusalem, you may see them in these pictures battering
down and undermining forts and castles, with instruments so well made and powerful, that all
other nations who came after them, for more than two thousand years, seem to have been content
to copy from them, and hardly to have improved on the old Assyrian engines.

Such, and so terrible, they came up against Jerusalem:  to attempt to fight them would have
been useless madness; and Hezekiah had but one means of escaping from them, and that was to
cast himself and his people upon the boundless mercy, and faithfulness, and power of God.

And Hezekiah had his answer by Isaiah the prophet:  and more than an answer.  The Lord took
the matter into His own hand, and showed Sennacherib which was the stronger, his soldiers and
horses and engines, or the Lord God; and so that terrible Assyrian army came utterly to nought,
and vanished off the face of the earth.

Now, my friends, has this noble history no lesson in it for us?  God forbid!  It has a lesson
which ought to come nearer to our hearts than to the hearts of any nation:  for though we or
our forefathers have never been, for nearly three hundred years, in such utter need and danger
as Jerusalem was, yet be sure that we might have been so, again and again, had it not been
for the mercy of the same God who delivered Jerusalem from the Assyrians.  It is now three
hundred years ago that the Lord delivered this country from as terrible an invader as Sennacherib
himself; when He three times scattered by storms the fleets of the King of Spain, which were
coming to lay waste this land with fire and sword:  and since then no foreign foe has set foot
on English soil, and we almost alone, of all the nations of Europe, have been preserved from
those horrors of war, even to speak of which is dreadful!  Oh, my friends! we know not half
God's goodness to us!

And if you ask me, why God has so blest and favoured this land, I can only answer--and I am
not ashamed or afraid to answer--I believe it is on account of the Church of England; it is
because God has put His name here in a peculiar way, as He did among the Jews of old, and that
He is jealous for His Church, and for the special knowledge of His Gospel and His Law, which
He has given us in our Prayer-book and in our Church Catechism, lighting therein a candle in
England which I believe will never be put out.  It is not merely that we are a Protestant country,--great
blessing as that is,--it is, I believe, that there is something in the Church of England which
there is not in Protestant countries abroad, unless perhaps Sweden:  for every one of them
(except Sweden and ourselves) has suffered, from time to time, invading armies, and the unspeakable
horrors of war.  In some of them the light of the Gospel has been quenched utterly, and in
others it lingers like a candle flickering down into the socket.  By horrible persecutions,
and murder, and war, and pillage, have those nations been tormented from time to time; and
who are we, that we should escape?  Certainly from no righteousness of our own.  Some may say,
It is our great wealth which has made us strong.  My friends, believe it not.  Look at Spain,
which was once the richest of all nations; and did her riches preserve her?  Has she not dwindled
down into the most miserable and helpless of all nations? Has not her very wealth vanished
from her, because she sold herself to work all unrighteousness with greediness?

Some may say, It is our freedom which makes us strong.  My friends, believe it not.  Freedom
is a vast blessing from God, but freedom alone will preserve no nation.  How many free nations
have fallen into every sort of misery, ay, into bitter slavery, in spite of all their freedom.
How many free nations in Europe lie now in bondage, gnawing their tongues for pain, and weary
with waiting for the deliverance which does not come?  No, my friends, freedom is of little
use without something else--and that is loyalty; reverence for law and obedience to the powers
that be, because men believe those powers to be ordained of God; because men believe that Christ
is their King, and they His ministers and stewards, and that He it is who appoints all orders
and degrees of men in His Holy Church. True freedom can only live with true loyalty and obedience,
such as our Prayer-book, our Catechism, our Church of England preaches to us.  It is a Church
meant for free men, who stand each face to face with their Heavenly Father:  but it is a Church
meant also for loyal men, who look on the law as the ordinance of God, and on their rulers
as the ministers of God; and if our freedom has had anything to do (as no doubt it has) with
our prosperity, I believe that we owe the greater part of our freedom to the teaching and the
general tone of mind which our Prayer-book has given to us and to our forefathers for now three
hundred years.

Not that we have listened to that teaching, or acted up to it:  God knows, we have been but
too like the Jews in Isaiah's time, who had the Law of God, and yet did every man what was
right in his own eyes; we, like them, have been hypocritical; we, like them, have neglected
the poor, and the widow, and the orphan; we, like them, have been too apt to pay tithe of mint
and anise, and neglect the weightier matters of the law, justice, mercy, and judgment.  When
we read that awful first chapter of Isaiah, we may well tremble; for all the charges which
he brings against the Jews of his time would just as well apply to us; but yet we can trust
in the Lord, as Isaiah did, and believe that He will be jealous for His land, and for His name's
sake, and not suffer the nations to say of us, 'Where is now their God?'  We can trust Him,
that if He turn His hand on us, as He did on the Jews of old, and bring us into danger and
trouble, yet it will be in love and mercy, that He may purge away our dross, and take away
all our alloy, and restore our rulers as at the first, and our counsellors as at the beginning,
that we may be called, 'The city of righteousness, the faithful city.'  True, we must not fancy
that we have any righteousness of our own, that we merit God's favour above other people; our
consciences ought to tell us that cannot be; our Bibles tell us that is an empty boast.

This is our hope, and this is the cause of our thankfulness.  For who but we should be thankful
this day that we are Englishmen, members of Christ's Church of England, inhabitants of, perhaps,
the only country in Europe which is not now perplexed with fear of change, while men's hearts
fail them for dread, and looking for those things which are coming on the earth? a country
which has never seen, as all the countries round have seen, a foreign army trampling down their
crops, burning their farms, cutting down their trees, plundering their towns, destroying in
a day the labour of years, while women are dishonoured, men tortured to make them give up their
money, the able-bodied driven from their homes, ruined and wanderers, and the sick and aged
left to perish of famine and neglect.  My friends, all these things were going on but last
year upon the Danube.  They are going on now in Asia:  even with all the mercy and moderation
of our soldiers and sailors, we have not been able to avoid inflicting some of these very miseries
upon our own enemies; and yet here we are, going about our business in peace and safety in
a land in which we and our forefathers have found, now for many a year, that just laws make
a quiet and prosperous people; that the effect of righteousness is peace, and the fruit of
righteousness, quietness and assurance for ever;--a land in which the good are not terrified,
the industrious hampered, and the greedy and lawless made eager and restless by expectation
of change in government; but every man can boldly and hopefully work in his calling, and 'whatsoever
his hand finds to do, do it with all his might,' in fair hope that the money which he earns
in his manhood he will be able to enjoy quietly in his old age, and hand it down safely to
his children, and his children's children;--a land which for hundreds of years has not felt
the unspeakable horrors of war; a land which even now is safely and peacefully gathering in
its harvest, while so many countries lie wasted with fire and sword. Oh, my friends, who made
us to differ from others, or what have we that we did not receive?  Not to ourselves do we
owe our blessings; hardly even to our wise forefathers:  but to God Himself, and the Spirit
of God which was with them, and is with us still, in spite of all our shortcomings.  We owe
it to our wise Constitution, to our wise Church, the principle of which is that God is Judge
and Christ is King, in peace as well as in war, in times of quiet as well as in times of change;
I say, to our wise Constitution and to our wise Church, which teach us that all power is of
God; that all men who have power, great or small, are His stewards; that all orders and degrees
of men in His Holy Church, from the queen on the throne to the labourer in the harvest-field,
are called by God to their ministry and vocation, and are responsible to God for their conduct
therein.  How then shall we show forth our thankfulness, not only in our lips, but in our lives?
How, but by believing that very principle, that very truth which He has taught us, and by which
England stands, that we are God's people, and God's servants?

Oh, my friends, come frankly and joyfully to the Lord's Table this day.  Confess your sins
and shortcomings to Him, and entreat Him to enable you to live more worthily of your many blessings.
Offer to Him the sacrifice of your praise and thankfulness, imperfect though it is, and join
with angels and archangels in blessing Him for what He is, and what He has been to you:  and
then receive your share of His most perfect sacrifice of praise and thanksgiving, the bread
and the wine which tell you that you are members of His Church; that His body gives you whatsoever
life and strength your souls have; that His blood washes out all your sins and shortcomings;
that His Spirit shall be renewed in you day by day, to teach you to do the good work which
He has prepared already for you, and to walk in the old paths which have led our forefathers,
and will lead us too, I trust, safe through the chances and changes of this mortal life, and
the fall of mighty kingdoms, towards that perfect City of God which is eternal in the heavens.

SERMON XV.  THE LIFE OF GOD

Ephesians iv. 17, 18.  That ye walk not as other Gentiles walk, in the vanity of their mind,
being alienated from the life of God through the ignorance that is in them, because of the
blindness of their heart.

You heard these words read in the Epistle for to-day.  I cannot expect that you all understood
them.  It is no shame to you that you did not.  Some of them are long and hard Latin words.
Some of them, though they are plain English enough, are hard to understand because they have
to do with deep matters, which can only be understood by the help of God's Spirit.  And even
with the help of God's Spirit we cannot any of us expect to understand all which they mean:
we cannot expect to be as wise as St. Paul; for we must be as good as St. Paul before we can
be as wise about goodness as he was.  I do not pretend to understand all the text myself: 
no, not half, nor a tenth part of what it very likely means.  But I do seem to myself to understand
a little about it, by the help and blessing of God; and what little of it I do understand,
I will try to make you understand also.

For the words in the text belong to you as much as to me, or to St. Paul himself.  What is
true for one man, is true for every man. What is right for one man, is right for every man.
What God promises for one man, He promises to every man.  Man or woman, black or white, rich
or poor, scholar or unlearned, there is no respect of persons with Him.  'In Christ Jesus,'
says St. Paul, 'there is neither male nor female, slave nor freeman, Jew who fancies that God's
promises belong to him alone, or Gentile who knows nothing about them, clever learned Greek,
or stupid ignorant Barbarian.'

It is enough for God that we are all men and women bearing the flesh, and blood, and human
nature which His Son Jesus Christ wore on earth.  If we are baptized, we belong to Him:  if
we are not baptized, we ought to be; for we belong to Him just as much.  Every man may be baptized;
every man may be regenerate; God calls all to His grace and adoption and holy baptism, which
is the sign and seal of His adoption; and therefore, what is right for the regenerate baptized
man, is right for the unregenerate unbaptized man; for the Christian and for the heathen there
is but one way, one duty, one life for both, and that is the life of God, of which St. Paul
speaks in the text.

Now of this life of God I will speak hereafter; but I mention it now, because it is the thing
to which I wish to bring your thoughts before the end of the sermon.

But first, let us see what St. Paul means, when he talks about the Gentiles in his day.  For
that also has to do with us.  I said that every man, Christian or heathen, has the same duty,
and is bound to do the same right; every man, Christian or heathen, if he sins, breaks his
duty in the same way, and does the same wrong.  There is but one righteousness, the life of
God; there is but one sin, and that is being alienated from the life of God.  One man may commit
different sorts of sins from another; one may lie, another may steal:  one may be proud, another
may be covetous:  but all these different sins come from the same root of sin; they are all
flowers of the same plant.  And St. Paul tells us what that one root of sin, what that same
Devil's plant, is, which produces all sin in Christian or Heathen, in Churchman or Dissenter,
in man or woman-- the one disease, from which has come all the sin which ever was done by man,
woman, or child since the world was made.

Now, what is this one disease, to which every man, you and I, are all liable?  Why it is that
we are every one of us worse than we ought to be, worse than we know how to be, and, strangest
of all, worse than we wish and like to be.

Just as far as we are like the heathen of old, we shall be worse than we know how to be.  For
we are all ready enough to turn heathens again, at any moment, my friends; and the best Christian
in this church knows best that what I say is true; that he is beset by the very same temptations
which ruined the old heathens, and that if he gave way to them a moment they would ruin him
likewise.  For what does St. Paul say was the matter with the old heathens?

First he says, 'Their understanding was darkened.'  But what part of it?  What was it that
they had got dark about and could not understand?  For in some matters they were as clever
as we, and cleverer.  What part of their understanding was it which was darkened?  St. Paul
tells us in the first chapter of the Epistle to the Romans.  It was their hearts--their reason,
as we should say. It was about God, and the life of God, that they were dark.  They had not
been always dark about God, but they were darkened; they grew more and more dark about Him,
generation after generation; they gave themselves up more and more to their corrupt and fallen
nature, and so the children grew worse than their fathers, and their children again worse than
them, till they had lost all notion of what God was like.  For from the very first all heathens
have had some notion of what God is like, and have had a notion also, which none but God could
have given them, that men ought to be like God. God taught, or if I may so speak, tried to
teach, the heathen, from the very first.  If God had not taught them, they would not have been
to blame for knowing nothing of God.  For as Job says, 'Can man by searching find out God?'
Surely not; God must teach us about Himself.  Never forget that man cannot find God; God must
show Himself to man of His own free grace and will.  God must reveal and unveil Himself to
us, or we shall never even fancy that there is a God.  And God did so to the heathen.  Even
before the Flood, God's Spirit strove with man; and after the Flood we read how the Lord, Jesus
Christ the Son of God, revealed Himself in many different ways to heathens.  To Pharaoh, king
of Egypt, in Abraham's times; and again to Abimelech, king of Gerar; and again to Pharaoh and
his servants, in Joseph's time; and to Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon, and to Cyrus, king
of Persia; and no doubt to thousands more. Indeed, no man, heathen or Christian, ever thought
a single true thought, or felt a single right feeling, about God or man, or man's duty to God
and his neighbour, unless God revealed it to him (whether or not He also revealed Himself to
the man and showed him who it was who was putting the right thought into his mind):  for every
right thought and feeling about God, and goodness, and duty, are the very voice of God Himself,
the word of God whereof St. John speaks, and Moses and the prophets speak, speaking to the
heart of sinful man, to enlighten and to teach him.  And therefore, St. Paul says, the sinful
heathen were without excuse, because, he says, 'that which may be known of God is manifest,
that is plain, among them, for God hath showed it to them.  They hated to think that God was
what He was, and shut their eyes, and stopped their ears as fast as possible.

And what happened to them in the meantime?  What was the fruit of their wilfully forgetting
what God's life was?  St. Paul tells us that they fell into the most horrible sins--sins too
dreadful and shameful to be spoken of; and that their common life, even when they did not run
into such fearful evils, was profligate, fierce, and miserable.  And yet St. Paul tells us
all the while they knew the judgment of God, that those who do such things are worthy of death.

Now we know that St. Paul speaks truth, from the writings of heathens; for God raised up from
time to time, even among the heathen Greeks and Romans, witnesses for Himself, to testify of
Him and of His life, and to testify against the sins of the world, such men as Socrates and
Plato among the Greeks, whose writings St. Paul knew thoroughly, and whom, I have no doubt,
he had in his mind when he wrote his first chapter of Romans, and told the heathen that they
were without excuse.  And among the Romans, also, He raised up, in the same way, witnesses
for Himself, such as Juvenal and Persius, and others, whom scholars know well.  And to these
men, heathens though they were, God certainly did teach a great deal about Himself, and gave
them courage to rebuke the sins of kings and rich men, even at the danger of their lives; and
to some of them he gave courage even to suffer martyrdom for the message which God had given
them, and which their neighbours hated to hear.  And this was the message which God sent by
them to the heathen:  that God was good and righteous, and that therefore His everlasting wrath
must be awaiting sinners.  They rebuked their heathen neighbours for those very same horrible
crimes which St. Paul mentions; and then they said, as St. Paul does, 'How you make your own
sins worse by blasphemies against God!  You sin yourselves, and then, to excuse yourselves,
you invent fables and lies about God, and pretend that God is as wicked as you are, in order
to drug your own consciences, by making God the pattern of your own wickedness.'

These men saw that man ought to be like God; and they saw that God was righteous and good;
and they saw, therefore, that unrighteousness and sin must end in ruin and everlasting misery.
So much God had taught them, but not much more; but to St. Paul he had taught more.  Those
wise and righteous heathen could show their sinful neighbours that sin was death, and that
God was righteous. But they could not tell them how to rise out of the death of sin, into God's
life of righteousness.  They could preach the terrors of the Law, but they did not know the
good news of the Gospel, and therefore they did not succeed; they did not convert their neighbours
to God.  Then came St. Paul and preached to the very same people, and he did convert them to
God; for he had good news for them, of things which prophets and kings had desired to see,
and had not seen them, and to hear, and had not heard them.  He sent Him to be a man:  very
man of the substance of His mother, the Blessed Virgin Mary, at the same time that He was Very
God, of the substance of His Father, begotten before all worlds.

And so God, and the life of God, was manifested in the flesh and reasonable soul of a man;
and from that time there is no doubt what the life of God is; for the life of God is the life
of Jesus Christ. There is no doubt now what God is like, for God is like Jesus Christ.  No
one can now say, 'I cannot see God, how then can you expect me to be like God?' for He who
has seen Jesus Christ, as His character stands in the Gospels, has seen God the Father.  No
one can say now, 'How can a man be like God, and live a life like God's life?' for if any one
of you say that, I can answer him:  'A man can be like God; you can be like God; for there
was once a man on earth, Jesus, the son of the Blessed Virgin, who was perfectly like God.'
And if you answer, 'But He was like God, because He was God,' I can say, 'And that is the very
reason why you can be like God also.'  If Jesus Christ had been only a man, you could no more
become like Him than you can become clever because another man is clever, or strong because
another man is strong:  but because He was God The Son of God, He can give you, to make you
like God, the same Holy Spirit which made Him like God; for that Holy Spirit proceeds from
Him, the Son, as well as from the Father, and the Father has committed all power to the Son;
and therefore that same Man Christ Jesus has power to change your heart, and renew it, and
shape it to be like Him, and like His Father, by the power of His Spirit, that you may be like
God as He was like God, and live the life of God which He lived; so that the Lord Jesus Christ,
because He was a man like God, showed that all men can become like God; and because He was
God, Very God of Very God, He is able to make all who come to Him men like Himself, men like
God, and raise them up body and soul to the everlasting life of God, that He may be the firstborn
among many brethren.

Now what is this everlasting life of God, which the Lord Jesus Christ lived perfectly, and
which He can and will make every one of us live, in proportion as we give up our hearts and
wills to Him, and ask Him to take charge of us, and shape us, and teach us?  When we read that
blessed story of Him who was born in a stable, and laid in a manger, who went about doing good,
because God was with Him, who condescended of His own freewill to be mocked, and scourged,
and spit upon, and crucified, that He might take away the sins of the whole world, who prayed
for His murderers, and blest those who cursed Him--what sort of life does this life of God,
which He lived, seem to us?  Surely it is; then that is the likeness of God.  God is love.
And the Lord Jesus' life was a life of love--utter, perfect, untiring love.  He did His Father's
will perfectly, because He loved men perfectly, and to the death. He died for those who hated
Him, and so He showed forth to man the name and glory of God; for God is love.  The name of
the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost is love; for love is justice and righteousness,
as it is written, 'Love worketh no ill to his neighbour:  therefore love is the fulfilling
of the law.'  And God is perfect love, because He is perfect righteousness; and perfect righteousness,
because He is perfect love; for His love and His justice are not two different things, two
different parts of God, as some say, who fancy that God's justice had to be satisfied in one
way, and His love in another, and talk of God as if His justice fought against His love, and
desired the death of a sinner, and then His love fought against His justice, and desired to
save a sinner.

Believe me, my friends, this is no mere question of words, which only has to do with scholars
in their libraries; it is a question, the question of life and death for you, and me, and every
living soul in this church,--Do we know what the life of God is? are we living it? or are we
alienated from it, careless about it, disliking it?

For, as I said at the beginning of my sermon, we are all ready enough to turn heathens again;
and if we grow to forget or dislike the life of God, we shall be heathen at heart.  We may
talk about Him with our lips, we may quarrel and curse each other about religious differences;
but let us make as great a profession as we may, if we do not love the life of God we shall
be heathen at heart, and we shall, sooner or later, fall into sin.  The heathens fell into
sin just in proportion as their hearts were turned away from the life of God, and so shall
we.  And how shall we know whether our hearts are turned away, or whether they are right with
God?  Thus: What are the fruits of God's Spirit? what sort of life does the Spirit of God make
man live?  For the Spirit of God is God, and therefore the life of God is the life which God's
Spirit makes men live; and what is that? a life of love and righteousness.

The old heathens did not like such a life, therefore they did not like to retain God in their
knowledge.  That was, in St. Paul's eyes, God's plainest witness of Himself--the sign that
God was Love, making His sun shine on the just and on the unjust, and good to the unthankful
and the evil--in one word, perfect, because He is perfect Love.  But they preferred to be selfish,
covetous, envious, revengeful, delighting to indulge themselves in filthy pleasures, to oppress
and defraud each other.  Do you?

For you can, I can, every baptized man can take his choice between the selfish life of the
heathens and the loving life of God:  we may either keep to the old pattern of man, which is
corrupt according to the deceitful lusts; or we may put on the new pattern of man, which is
after God's likeness, and founded upon righteousness and truthful holiness.

Every baptized man may choose.  For he is not only bound to live the life of God:  every man,
as the old heathen philosophers knew, is bound to live it:  but more.  The baptized man can
live it:  that is the good news of his baptism.  You can live the life of God, for you know
what the life of God is--it is the life of Jesus Christ.  You can live the life of God, for
the Spirit of God is with you, to cleanse your soul and life, day by day, till they are like
the soul and life of Christ.  As I told you just now, the heathens of old might have known
that, if they had chosen to open their eyes and see.  But they would not see.  They were dark,
cruel, and unloving, and therefore they fancied that God was dark, cruel, and unloving also.
They did not love Love, and therefore they did not love God, for God is Love. And therefore
they did not love loving:  they did not enjoy loving; and so they lost the Spirit of God, which
is the Spirit of Love. And therefore they did not love each other, but lived in hatred and
suspicion, and selfishness, and darkness.  They were but heathen. But if even they ought to
have known that God was Love, how much more we?  For we know of a deed of God's love, such
as those poor heathen never dreamed of.  And to those who long to do that, God's Spirit will
come to fill them with love; and where the Spirit of God is, there is also the Father, and
there is also the Son; for God's substance cannot be divided, as the Athanasian creed tells
us (and blessed and cheering words they are); and he who hath the Holy Spirit of Love with
him hath both the Father and the Son; as it is written:  'If a man love Me, my Father will
love him, and we will come unto him, and make our abode with him.'

And then, if we have God abiding with us, and filling us with His Eternal Life, what more do
we need for life, or death, or eternity, or eternities of eternities?  For we shall live in
and with and by God, who can never die or change, an everlasting life of love, whereof St.
Paul says, that though prophecies shall fail, and tongues shall cease, and knowledge shall
vanish away, because all that we know now is but in part, and all that we see now is through
a glass darkly, yet Love shall never fail, but abide for ever and ever.

SERMON XVI.  GOD'S OFFSPRING

Galatians iv. 7.  He is not speaking of the Jews only; for these Galatians to whom he was writing
were not Jews at all, any more than we are.  He was speaking to men simply as men.  He was
speaking to the Galatians as we have a right to speak to all men.

Nor does he mean merely when we were children in age.  The Greek word which he uses, means
infants, people not come to years of discretion.  Indeed, the word which he uses means very
often a simpleton, an ignorant or foolish person; one who does not know who and what he is,
what is his duty, or how to do it.

Now this, he says, was the state of men before Christ came; this is the state of all men by
nature still; the state of all poor heathens, whether in England or in foreign countries.

They are children--that is, ignorant and unable to take care of themselves; because they do
not know what they are.  St. Paul tells us what they are.  That they are all God's offspring,
though they know it not.  He likens them to young children, who, though they are their father's
heirs, have no more liberty than slaves have; but are kept under tutors and masters, till they
have arrived at years of discretion, and are fit to take their places as their father's sons,
and to go out into the world, and have the management of their own affairs, and a share in
their father's property, which they may use for themselves, instead of being merely fed and
clothed by, and kept in subjection to him, whether they will or not.  This is what he means
by receiving the adoption of sons.  He does not mean that we are not God's children till we
find out that we are God's children.  That is what some people say; but that is the very exact
contrary to what St. Paul used to say.  He told the heathen Athenians that they were God's
children.  He put them in mind that one of their own heathen poets had told them so, and had
said, 'We are also God's offspring.'  And so in this chapter he says, You were God's children
all along, though you did not know it.  The Jews were keeping, or pretending to keep, Moses'
law, and trying to please God by that.  The heathens were keeping all manner of old superstitious
laws and customs about religion which their forefathers had handed down to them.  But heathens,
and indeed Jews too, at that time, all agreed in one thing.  These laws and customs of theirs
about religion all went upon the notion of their being God's slaves, and not his children.
They thought that God did not love them; that they must buy His favours.  They thought religion
meant a plan for making God love them.

Then appeared the love of God in Jesus Christ.  As at this very Christmas time, the Son of
God, Jesus Christ the Lord, in whose likeness man was made at the beginning, was born into
the world, to redeem us and all mankind.  He told them of their Heavenly Father; He preached
to them the good news of the kingdom of God; that God had not forgotten them, did not hate
them, would freely forgive them all that was past; and why?  Because He was their Father, and
loved them, and loved them so that He spared not His only begotten Son, but freely gave Him
for them.  And now God looks at us human beings, not as we are in ourselves, sinful and corrupt,
but he looks at us in the light of Jesus Christ, who has taken our nature upon Him, and redeemed
it, and raised it up again, so that God can look on it now without disgust, and henceforth
no one need be ashamed of being a man; for to be a man is to be in the likeness of God.  Man
was created in the image and likeness of God, and who is the image and likeness of God but
Jesus Christ?  Therefore man was created at first in Jesus Christ, and now, as St. Paul says,
he is created anew in Jesus Christ; and now to be a man is to partake of the same flesh and
blood which the Lord Jesus Christ wore for us, when He was made very man of the substance of
his mother, and that without spot of sin, to show that man need not be sinful, that man was
meant by God to be holy and pure from sin, and that by the Holy Spirit of Jesus Christ we,
every one of us, can become pure from sin.  This is the blessedness of Christmas-day.  That
one man, at least, has been born into the world spotless and free from sin, that He might be
the firstborn of many brethren.  This is the good news of Christmas-day. That now, in Christ's
light, and for Christ's sake, our Father looks on us as His sons, and not His slaves.

Therefore is every child who comes into the world baptized freely into the name of God.  Baptism
is a sign and warrant that God loves that child; that God looks on it as His child, not for
itself or its own sake, but because it belongs to Jesus Christ, who, by becoming a man, redeemed
all mankind, and made them His property and His brothers.  Therefore every child, when it is
brought to be baptized, promises, by its godfathers and godmothers, repentance and faith, when
it comes to years of understanding.  It is not God's slave, as the beasts are.  It is God's
child.  But God does not wish it to remain merely His child, under tutors and governors, forced
to do what is right outwardly, and whether it likes or not.  God wishes each of us to become
His son, His grown-up and reasonable son.  To know who we are;--to work in His kingdom for
Him;--to guide and manage our own wills, and hearts, and lives in obedience to Him;--to claim
and take our share as men of God of the inheritance which He has given us.  And that we can
only do by faith in Jesus Christ.  We must trust in Him, our Lord, our King, our Saviour, our
Pattern.  We must confess that we are nothing in ourselves, that we owe all to Him.  We must
follow in his footsteps, giving up our wills to God's will, doing not our own works, but the
good works which God has prepared for us to walk in; and then we shall be truly confirmed;
not mere children of God, under tutors, governors, schoolmasters and lawgivers, but free, reasonable,
willing, hearty Christians, perfect men of God, the sons of God without rebuke.

Oh, my friends, will you claim your share in the Spirit of God, whom the Lord bought for us
with His precious blood, that Spirit who was given you at your baptism, which may be daily
renewed in you, if you pray for it; who will strengthen and lift you up to lead lives worthy
of your high calling?  Or will you, like Esau of old, despise your birthright, and neglect
to pray that God's Spirit may be renewed in you, and so lose more and more day by day the thought
that God is your Father, and the love of holy and godlike things? Alas! take care that, like
Esau, you hereafter find no room for repentance, though you seek it carefully with tears! 
It is a fearful thing to despise the mercies of the living God; and when you are called to
be His sons, to fall back under the terrors of His law, in slavish fears and a guilty conscience,
and remorse which cannot repent.

And do not give way to false humility, says St. Paul.  Do not say, 'This is too high an honour
for us to claim.'  Do not say, 'It seems too conceited and assuming for us miserable sinners
to call ourselves sons of God.  We shall please God better, and show ourselves more reverent
to Him, by calling ourselves His slaves, and crouching and trembling before Him, as if we expected
Him to strike us dead, and making all sorts of painful and tiresome religious observances,
and vain repetitions of prayers, to win His favour;' or by saying, 'We dare not call ourselves
God's children yet; we are not spiritual enough; but when we have gone through all the necessary
changes of heart, and frames, and feeling, and have been convinced of sin, and converted, and
received the earnest, God's Spirit, by which we cry, Abba, Father! then we shall have a right
to call ourselves God's children.'

Not so, says St. Paul, all through this very Epistle to the Galatians.  That is not being reverent
to God.  It is insulting Him. For it is despising the honour which He has given you, and trying
to get another honour of your own invention, by observances, and frames, and feelings of your
own.  Do not say, 'When we have received the earnest of God's Spirit, by which we can cry,
Abba, Father! then we shall become God's children;' for it is just because you are God's children
already--just because you have been God's children all along, that God has taught you to call
Him Father.  The Lord Jesus Christ told men that God was their Father. Not merely to the Apostles,
but to poor, ignorant, sinful wretches, publicans and harlots, He spoke of their Father in
heaven, who, because He is a perfect Father, sends His sun to shine on the evil and the good,
and His rain to fall on the just and on the unjust. The Lord Jesus Christ taught men--all men,
not merely saints and Apostles, but all men, when they prayed--to begin, 'Our Father.'  He
told them that that was the manner in which they were to pray, and therefore no other way of
praying can we expect God to hear.  No slavish, terrified, superstitious coaxing and flattering
will help you with God.  He has told you to call Him your Father; and if you speak to Him in
any other way, you insult Him, and trample under foot the riches of His grace.

This is the good news which the Bible preaches.  This is the witness of God's Spirit, proclaiming
that we are the sons of God; and, says St. Paul in another place, 'our spirit witnesses' to
that glorious news as well.  We feel, we know--why, we cannot tell, but we feel and know that
we are the sons of God.  When we are most calm, most humble, most free from ill-temper and
self-conceit, most busy about our rightful work, then the feeling comes over us--I have a Father
in heaven.  And that feeling gives us a strength, a peace, a sure trust and hope, which no
other thought can give.  Yes, we are ready to say, I may be miserable and unfortunate, but
the Great God of heaven and earth is my Father; and what can happen to me?  I may be borne
down with the remembrance of my great sins; I may find it almost too hard to fight against
all my bad habits; but the Great God who made heaven and earth is my Father, and I am His son.
He will forgive me for the past; He will help me to conquer for the future.  If I do but remember
that I am God's son, and claim my Father's promises, neither the world, nor the devil, nor
my own sinful flesh, can ever prevail against me.

This thought, and the peace which it brings, St. Paul tells us is none of our own; we did not
put it into our own hearts; from God it comes, that blessed thought, that He is our Father.
We could never have found it out for ourselves.  It is the Spirit of the Son of God, the Spirit
of the Lord Jesus Christ, which gives us courage to say, 'Our Father which art in heaven,'
which makes us feel that those words are true, and must be true, and are worth all other words
in the world put together--that God is our Father, and we his sons.  Oh, my friends, believe
earnestly this blessed news! the news of Christmas-day, that you are not God's slaves, but
his sons, heirs of God, and joint-heirs with Christ;--joint-heirs with Christ!  In what?  Who
can tell?  But what an inheritance of glory and bliss that must be, which the Lord Jesus Christ
Himself is to inherit with us--an inheritance such as eye hath not seen, and incorruptible,
undefiled, and that fadeth not away, preserved in heaven for us; an inheritance of all that
is wise, loving, noble, holy, peaceful--all that can make us happy, all that can make us like
God Himself.  Oh, what can we expect, if we neglect so great salvation?  What can we expect,
if when the Great God of heaven and earth tells us that we are His children, we turn away and
fall down, become like the brutes, and the savages, or worse, like the evil spirits who rebel
against God, instead of growing up to become the sons of God, perfect even as our Father in
heaven is perfect?  May He keep us all from that great sin!  May He awaken each and every one
of you to know the glory and honour which Jesus Christ brought for you when He was born at
Bethlehem--the glory and honour which was proclaimed to belong to you when you were christened
at that font!  May He awaken you to know that you are the sons of God, and to look up to Him
with loving, trustful, obedient souls, saying from your hearts, morning and night 'Our Father
which art in heaven,' and feeling that those words give you daily strength to conquer your
sins, and feel assurance of hope that your Heavenly Father will help and prosper you, His family,
every time you struggle to obey His commandments, and follow the example of His perfect and
spotless Son, Jesus Christ the Lord!

My friends, what this text really means is one thing; what we may choose to think it means
is another thing--perhaps a very different thing.  I will try and show you what I believe it
really means.  And certainly that wise and great man, whoever he was (some say he was St. Ambrose,
Bishop of Milan, in Italy), who wrote the Te Deum, thought the same; for how does he end the
Te Deum?  'O Lord, in Thee have I trusted:  let me never be confounded,' that is, brought to
shame.  Not so.  In all great hymns and writings like this, the end is almost sure to be the
strongest part of all, to have the very pith and marrow of the whole matter in it, as I believe
this end of the Te Deum has; and I believe that whoever wrote it thought that being confounded,
and brought to shame, was just the most horrible and wretched thing which could happen to him,
or any man, and the thing above all others from which he was most bound to pray God to save
him and every human being.

Now, how is this?  First, let us look at what coming to shame is; and next, how believing in
Christ will save us from it.

Now, every man and woman of us here, who has one spark of good feeling in them, will surely
agree, that coming to shame is dreadful; and that there is no pain or torment on earth like
the pain of being ashamed of oneself:  nothing so painful.  And I will prove it to you.  You
call a man a brave man, if he is afraid of nothing:  but there is one thing the very bravest
man is afraid of, and that is of disgrace, of coming to shame.  Ay, my friends, so terrible
is the torment of shame, that you may see brave men,--men who would face death in battle, men
who would have a limb cut off without a groan, you may see such, in spite of all their courage,
gnash their teeth, and writhe in agony, and weep bitter tears, simply because they are ashamed
of themselves, so terrible and unbearable is the torment of shame.  It may drive a man to do
good or evil:  it may drive him to do good; as when, rather than come to shame, and be disgraced,
soldiers will face death in battle willingly and cheerfully, and do deeds of daring beyond
belief:  or it may drive him to do evil; rather than come to shame, men have killed themselves,
choosing, unhappy and mistaken men, rather to face the torment of hell than the torment of
disgrace.  They are mistaken enough, God knows.  But shame, like all powerful things, will
work for harm as well as for good; and just as a wholesome and godly shame may be the beginning
of a man's repentance and righteousness, so may an unwholesome and ungodly shame be the cause
of his despair and ruin.  But judge for yourselves; think over your past lives.  Were you ever
once--were it but for five minutes-- utterly ashamed of yourself?  If you were, did you ever
feel any torment like that?  In all other misery and torment one feels hope; one says, 'Still
life is worth having, and when the sorrow wears away I shall be cheerful and enjoy myself again:'
but when one has come to shame, when one is not only disgraced in the eyes of other people,
but disgraced (which is a thousand times worse) in one's own eyes; when one feels that people
have real reason to despise one, then one feels for the time as if life was not worth having;
as if one did not care whether one died or not, or what became of one:  and yet as if dying
would do one no good, change of place would do one no good, time's running on would do one
no good; as if what was done could not be undone, and the shame would be with one still, and
torment one still, wherever one was, and if one was to live a million years:  ay, that it would
be everlasting:  one feels, in a word, that real shame and deserved disgrace is verily and
indeed an everlasting torment.  And it is this, and the feeling of this, which explains why
poor wretches will kill themselves, as Judas Iscariot did, and rush into hell itself, under
the horror and pain of shame and disgrace.  They feel a hell within them so hot, that they
actually fancy that they can be no worse off beyond the grave than they are on this side of
it.  They are mistaken:  but that is the reason; the misery of disgrace is so intolerable,
that they are willing, like that wretched Judas, to try any mad and desperate chance to escape it.

So much for shame's being a dreadful and horrible thing.  But again, it is a spiritual thing:
it grows and works not in our fleshly bodies, but in our spirits, our consciences, our immortal
souls. You may see this by thinking of people who are not afraid of shame. You do not respect
them, or think them the better for that.  Not at all.  If a man is not afraid of shame; if
a man, when he is found out, and exposed, and comes to shame, does not care for it, but 'brazens
out his own shame,' as we say, we do not call him brave; we call him what he is, a base impudent
person, lost to all good feeling.  Why, what harder name can we call any man or woman, than
to say that they are 'shameless,' dead to shame?  We know that it is the very sign of their
being dead in sin, the very sign of God's Spirit having left them; that till they are made
to feel shame there is no hope of their mending or repenting, or of any good being put into
them, or coming out of them.  So that this feeling of shame is a spiritual feeling, which has
to do with a man's immortal soul, with his conscience, and the voice of God in his heart.

Now, consider this:  that there will surely come to you and me, and every living soul, a day
of judgment; a day in which we shall be judged.  Think honestly of those two words.  First,
a day, not a mere time, much less a night.  Now, in a day there is light, by which men can
see, and a sun in heaven which shows all things clearly.  In that day, that brightest and clearest
of all days, we shall see what we really have been, and what we really have done; and for aught
we know, every one round us, every one with whom we have ever had to do, will see it also.
The secrets of all our hearts will be disclosed; and we shall stand before heaven and earth
simply for what we are, and neither more nor less.  That is a fearful thought!  Shall we come
to shame in that day?  And it will be a day of judgment:  in it we shall be judged.  I do not
mean merely condemned, for we may be acquitted:  or punished, for we may be rewarded; those
things come after being judged.  First, let us think of what being judged is.  A judge's business
is to decide on what we have done, or whether we have broken the law or not; to hear witnesses
for us and against us, to sum up the evidence, and set forth the evidence for us and the evidence
against us.  And our judge will be the Son of Man, the Lord Jesus Christ, who is sharper than
a two-edged sword, piercing through the very joints and marrow, and discerning the secret intents
of the heart; neither is anything hid from Him, for all things are naked and open in the sight
of Him with whom we have to do.  With whom we have to do, mind:  not merely with whom we shall
have to do; for He sees all now, He knows all now.  Ever since we were born, there has not
been a thought in our heart but He has known it altogether.  And He is utterly just--no respecter
of persons; like His own wisdom, without partiality and without hypocrisy.  O Lord! who shall
stand in that day?  O Lord! if thou be extreme to mark what is done amiss, who shall abide
it?  O Lord! in thee have I trusted:  let me never be confounded!

For this is being confounded; this is shame itself.  This is the intolerable, horrible, hellish
shame and torment, wherein is weeping and gnashing of teeth; this is the everlasting shame
and contempt to which, as Daniel prophesied, too many should awake in that day--to be found
guilty in that day before God and Christ, before our neighbours and our relations, and worst
of all, before ourselves. Worst of all, I say, before ourselves.  It would be dreadful enough
to have all the bad things we ever did or thought told openly against us to all our neighbours
and friends, and to see them turn away from us;--dreadful to find out at last (what we forget
all day long) that God knows them already; but more dreadful to know them all ourselves, and
see our sins in all their shamefulness, in the light of God, as God Himself sees them;--more
dreadful still to see the loving God and the loving Christ turn away from us;--but most dreadful
of all to turn away from ourselves; to be utterly discontented with ourselves; ashamed of ourselves;
to see that all our misery is our own fault, that we have been our own enemies; to despise
ourselves, and hate ourselves for ever; to try for ever to get rid of ourselves, and escape
from ourselves as from some ugly and foul place in which we were ashamed to be seen for a moment:
and yet not to be able to get rid of ourselves.  Yes, that will be the true misery of a lost
soul, to be ashamed of itself, and hate itself.  I thank God, that at least now, here, in this
life, we can be delivered.  There is but one hope for us all; one way for us all, not to come
to utter shame.  My friends, if, as I have been showing, the great misery, the great horror
of all, is having our sins mentioned to us in That Day, and being made utterly ashamed by them,
what greater mercy can we want than this--not to have them mentioned to us, and not to come
to shame; not to be plagued for ever with the hideous ghosts of our past bad thoughts, bad
words, bad deeds, coming all day long to stare us in the face, and cry to us while the accusing
Devil holds them up to us, as if in a looking- glass--'Look at your own picture.  This is what
you are.  This fool, this idler, this mean, covetous, hard-hearted man, who cared only for
himself;--this stupid man, who never cared to know his duty or do his duty;--this proud, passionate,
revengeful man, who returned evil for evil, took his brothers by the throat, and exacted from
them the uttermost farthing;--this ridiculous, foolish, useless, disagreeable, unlovely, unlovable
person, who went through the world neither knowing what he ought to do, nor whither he was
going, but was utterly blind and in a dream; this person is you yourself.  Look at your own
likeness, and be confounded, and utterly ashamed for ever!'  What greater misery than that?
What greater blessing than to escape that?  What greater blessing than to be able to answer
the accusing Devil, 'Not so, liar!  This is not my likeness.  This ugly, ridiculous, hateful
person is not I.  I was such a one once, but I am not now.  I am another man now; and God knows
that I am, though you may try to shame me by telling me that I am the same man.  I was wrong,
but I am right now; I was as a sheep going astray, but now I am returned to the Shepherd and
Overseer of my soul, to whom I belonged all the while; and now I am right, in the right road;
for with the heart I have believed God unto righteousness, and He has given me a clean heart,
and a right spirit, and has purged me, and will purge me, till I am clean, and washed me till
I am whiter than snow; I do not deny one of my old sins; I did them, I know that; I confess
them to thee now, oh accusing Devil; but I confessed them to God, ay, and to man too, long
ago, and by confessing them to Him I was saved from them; for with the mouth confession is
made unto salvation.  And what is more; I have not only confessed my own sins, but I have confessed
Christ's righteousness; and I confess it now. I confess, I say, that Christ is perfectly righteous
and good, the Perfect Pattern of what I ought to be; and because He is perfectly good, He does
not wish to see me remain bad and sinful, that He may taunt me and torment me with my sins,
as thou the accusing Devil dost:  but He wishes to make me and every man good like Himself,
blest like Himself; and He can do it, and will do it, if we will but give up our hearts to
Him; and I have given up my heart to Him.  All I ask of Him is to be made good and kept good,
set right and kept right; and I can trust in Him utterly to do that; for He is faithful and
just to forgive me my sins, and cleanse me from all unrighteousness.  Therefore, accuse me
not, Devil! for thou hast no share in me:  I belong to Christ, and not to thee.  And set not
my old sins before my face; for God has set them behind His back, because I have renounced
them, and sworn an oath against them, and Christ has nailed them to His cross, and now they
are none of mine and none of thine, but are cast long ago into the everlasting fire of God,
and burnt up and done with for ever; and I am a new man, and God's man; and He has justified
me, and will justify me, and make me just and right; and neither thou, nor any man, has a right
to impute to me my past sins, for God does not impute them to me; and neither thou, nor any
man, has a right to condemn me, for God has justified me.  And if it please God to humble me
more (for I know I want humbling every day), and to show me more how much I owe to Him--if
it please Him, I say, to bring to light any of my past sins, I shall take it patiently as a
wholesome chastening of my Heavenly Father's; and I trust to all God's people, and to angels,
and the spirits of just men made perfect, that they will look on my past sins as God looks
on them, mercifully and lovingly, as things past and dead, forgiven and blotted out of God's
book, by the precious blood of Christ, and look on me as I am in Christ, not having any righteousness
of my own, but Christ's righteousness, which comes by the inspiration of His own Holy Spirit.'

Thus, my friends, we may answer the Devil, when he stands up to accuse us, and confound us
in the Day of Judgment.  Thus we may answer him now, when, in melancholy moments, he sets our
sins before our face, and begins taunting us, and crying, 'See what a wretch you are, what
a hypocrite, too.  What would all the world think of you, if they knew as much against you
as I do?  And while Almighty God, who made heaven and earth, is saying that of me, it matters
little what the lying Devil may say.'

Only, only, if you be wandering from your Father's house, come home; if you be wrong, entreat
to be made right.  If you are in your Father's house, stay there; if you are right, pray and
struggle to keep right; if the old account is blotted out, then, for your soul's sake, run
up no fresh account to stand against you after all in the Day of Judgment; if you have the
hope in you of not coming to shame, you must purify yourselves, even as God is pure; if you
believe really with your heart, you must believe unto righteousness; that is, you must trust
God to make you righteous and good:  there is no use trusting Him to make you anything else,
for He will make you nothing else; being good Himself, He will only make you good:  but as
for trusting in Him to leave you bad, to leave you quiet in your sins, and then to save you
after all, that is trusting that God will do a most unjust, and what is more, a most cruel
thing to you; that is trusting God to do the Devil's work; that is a blasphemous false trust,
which will be utterly confounded in the Day of Judgment, and will cover you with double shame.
The whole question for each of us is, 'Do we believe unto righteousness?'  Is righteousness
what we want?  Is to be made good men what we want?  If not, no confessing with the mouth will
be unto salvation, for how can a man be saved in his sins?  If an animal is diseased can it
be saved from dying without curing the disease?  If a tree be decayed, can it be saved from
dying without curing the decay?  If a man be bad and sinful, can he be saved from eternal death
without curing his badness and sinfulness?  How can a man be saved from his sins but by becoming
sinless?  As well ask, Can a man be saved from his sins without being saved from his sins?
But if you wish really to be saved from your sins, and taken out of them, and cured of them,
that you may be made good men, righteous men, useful men, just men, loving men, Godlike men;--then
trust in God for that, and you will find that your trust will be unto righteousness, for you
will become righteous men; and confess God with your mouth for that, saying, 'I believe in
God my Father; I believe in Jesus Christ His Son, who died, and rose, and ascended on high
for me; I believe in God's Holy Spirit, which is with me, to make me right;' and your confession
will be unto salvation, for you will be saved from your sins.

Always say to yourself this one thing, 'Good I will become, whatever it cost me; and in God's
goodness I trust to make me good, for I am sure He wishes to see me good, more than I do myself;
and you will find that because you have confessed, in that best and most honest of ways, that
God is good, and have so given Him real glory, and real honour, and real praise, He will save
you from the sins which torment you:  and that because you have really trusted in Him, you
shall never come, either in this world, or the world to come, to that worst misery, the being
ashamed of yourself.

SERMON XIX.  FORGIVENESS

Psalm li. 16, 17.

You all heard just now the story of Nathan and David, and you must have all felt how beautiful,
and noble, and just it was; how it declares that there is but one everlasting God's law of
justice, which is above all men, even the greatest; and that what is right for the poor man
is right for the king upon his throne, for God is no respecter of persons.

And you must have admired, too, the frankness, and fulness, and humbleness of David's repentance,
and liked and loved the man still, in spite of his sins, as much almost as you did when you
heard of him as a shepherd boy slaying the giant, or a wanderer and an outlaw among the hills
and forests of Judaea.

But did it now seem strange to you that David's repentance, which was so complete when it did
come, should have come no sooner?  Did he need Nathan to tell him that he had done wrong? 
He seduced another man's wife, and that man one of his most faithful servants, one of the most
brave and loyal generals of his army; and then, over and above his adultery, he had plotted
the man's death, and had had him killed and put out of the way in as base, and ungrateful,
and treacherous a fashion as I ever heard of.  His whole conduct in the matter had been simply
villanous.  There is no word too bad for it. And do you fancy that he had to wait the greater
part of a year before the thought came into his head that that was not the fashion in which
a man ought to behave, much more a king?--that God's blessing was not on such doings as those?--and
after all not find out for himself that he was wrong, but have to be told of it by Nathan?

Surely, if he had any common sense, any feeling of right and wrong left in him, he must have
known that he had done a bad thing; and his guilty conscience must have tormented him many
a time and oft during those months, long before Nathan came to him.

But more; if we look at two psalms which he wrote about that time, we shall find that his conscience
had not been dead in him, but had been tormenting him bitterly; and that he had been trying
to escape from it, and afterwards to repent--only in a wrong way.

If we look at the Thirty-second Psalm, we shall see there he had begun, by trying to deceive
himself, to excuse himself before God. But that had only made him the more miserable.  He had
fancied, I suppose, that he could make God pleased with him again by showing great devoutness,
by offering bullocks and goats without number, as sin-offerings and peace-offerings; but that
made him no happier.  At last he found out that God required no sacrifice but a broken heart.
That was what God wanted--a broken and a contrite heart; for David to be utterly ashamed of
himself, utterly broken down and silenced, so that he had nothing left to plead--neither past
good deeds, nor present devoutness, nor sacrifices:  nothing but, 'O God, I deserve all Thou
canst lay on me, and more.  Have mercy on me--mercy is all I ask.'

There was nothing for him, you see, but to make a clean breast of it; to face his sin, and
all its shame and abomination, and confess it all, and throw himself on God's mercy.  And when
he did that, there, then, and at once, as Nathan told him, God put away his sin.  It is easy
to say, We have not sinned as deeply as David, and therefore his story has nothing to do with
us.  My friends, whether we have sinned as deeply as David or not, his story has to do with
you, and me, and every soul in this church, and every soul in the whole world, or it would
not be in the Bible.  For no prophecy of Scripture is of private interpretation; that is, it
does not only point at one man here and another there:  but those who wrote it were moved by
the Holy Ghost, who lays down the eternal universal laws of holiness, of right and good, which
are right and good for you, and me, and all mankind; and therefore David's story has to do
with you and me every time we do wrong, and know that we have done wrong.

Now, my friends, when you have done a wrong thing, you know your conscience torments you with
it; you are uneasy, and discontented with yourselves, perhaps cross with those about you; you
hardly know why:  or rather, though you do know why, you do not like to tell yourself why.

The bad thing which you have done, or the bad tempers which you have given way to, or the person
whom you have quarrelled with, hang in your mind, and darken all your thoughts:  and you try
not to remember them:  but conscience makes you remember them, and will not let the dark thought
fly away; till you can enjoy nothing, because your heart is not clean and clear; there is something
in the background which makes you sad whenever you try to be happy.  Then a man tries first
to deceive himself.  He says to himself, 'No, that sin is not what makes me unhappy--not that;'
and he tries to find out any and every reason for his uncomfortable feelings, except the very
thing which he knows all the while in the bottom of his heart is the real reason.  He says,
'Well, perhaps I am unhappy because I have done something wrong:  what wrong can I have done?'
And so he sets to work to find out every sin except the sin which is the cause of all, because
that one he does not like to face:  it is too real, and ugly, and humbling to his proud spirit;
and perhaps he is afraid of having to give it up.  So I have known a man confess himself a
sinner, a miserable sinner, freely enough, and then break out into a rage with you, if you
dare to speak a word of the one sin which you know that he has actually committed.  'No, sir,'
he will say, 'whatever I may be wrong in, I am right there.  I have committed sins too many,
I know:  but you cannot charge me with that, at least;'--and all the more because he knows
that everybody round is charging him with it, and that the thing is as notorious as the sun
in heaven.  But that makes him, in his pride, all the more determined not to confess himself
in the wrong on that one point; and he will go and confess to God, and perhaps to man, all
manner of secret sins, nay, even invent sins for himself out of things which are no sins, and
confess himself humbly in the wrong where perhaps he is all right, just to drug his conscience,
and be able to say, 'I have repented,'--repented, that is, of everything but what he and all
the world know that he ought to repent of.

But still his conscience is not easy:  he has no peace of mind:  he is like David:  'While
I held my peace, my bones waxed old through my daily complaining.'  God's hand is heavy on
him day and night, and his moisture is like the drought in summer:  his heart feels hard and
dry; he cannot enjoy himself; he is moody; he lies awake and frets at night, and goes listlessly
and heavily about his business in the morning; his heart is not right with God, and he knows
it; God and he are not at peace, and he knows it.

Then he tries to repent:  but it is a false, useless sort of repentance.  He says to Himself,
as David did, 'Well, then, I will make my peace with God:  I will please Him.  I have done
one wrong thing.  I will do two right ones to make up for it.'  If he is a rich man, he perhaps
tries David's plan of burnt-offerings and sacrifices.  He says, 'I will give away a great deal
in charity; I will build a church; I will take a great deal of trouble about societies, and
speak at religious meetings, and show God how much I really do care for Him after all, and
what great sacrifices I can make for Him.'

Or, if he is a poor man, he will say, 'Well, then, I will try and be more religious; I will
think more about my soul, and come to church as often as I can, and say my prayers regularly,
and read good books; and perhaps that will make my peace with God.  At all events, God shall
see that I am not as bad as I look; not altogether bad; that I do care for Him, and for doing
right.'

But, rich or poor, the man finds out by bitter experience how truly David said, 'Thou requirest
no sacrifice, else would I give it Thee. Thou delightest not in burnt-offerings.'

Not that they are not good and excellent; but that they are not good coming from him, because
his heart is still unrepentant, because, instead of confessing his sin and throwing himself
on God's mercy, he is trying to win God round to overlook his sin.  So almsgiving, and ordinances,
and prayer give the poor man no peace.  He rises from his knees unrefreshed.  He goes out of
church with as heavy a heart as he went in, and he finds that for all his praying he does not
become a better man, any more than a happier man.  There is still that darkness over his soul,
like a black cloud spread between him and God.

My friends, if any of you find yourselves in this sad case, the only remedy which I can give
you, the only remedy which I ever found do me any good, or give me back my peace of mind, is
David's remedy; the one which he found out at last, and which he spoke of in these blessed
Psalms.  Confess your sin to God.  Bring it all out.  Make a clean breast of it--whatever it
may cost you, make a clean breast of it.  Only be but honest with God, and all will come right
at once. Say, not with your lips only, but from the very bottom of your heart, say, 'Oh, good
God, Heavenly Father, I have nothing to say; I am wrong, and yet I do not know how wrong I
am; but Thou knowest. Thou seest all my sin a thousand times more clearly than I do; and if
I look black and foul to myself, oh God, how much more black and how foul must I look to Thee!

  But the poorest man or woman can do that; the
poorest man or woman can be courteous and tender, careful not to pain people, ready and willing
to help every one to the best of their power; and therefore, the poorest man or woman can be
a true gentleman or a true lady in the sight of God, by the inspiration of the Spirit of God,
whose name is Charity.

They can be.  And thanks be to the grace of God, they often are.  I can say that I have seen
among plain sailors and labouring men as perfect gentlemen (of God's sort) as man need see;
but then they were always pious and God-fearing men; and so the Spirit of God had made up to
them for any want of scholarship and rank.  They were gentlemen, because God's Spirit had made
them gentle.  For recollect all, both rich and poor, what that word gentleman means.  It is
simply a man who is gentle; who, let him be as brave or as wise as he will, yet, as St. Paul
says, 'suffers long and is kind; does not boast, does not behave himself unseemly; is not easily
provoked, thinketh no evil.'

And recollect, too, what that word lady means.  Most of you perhaps do not know.  I will tell
you.  It means, in the ancient English tongue, a person who gives away bread; who deals out
loaves to the poor.  I have often thought that most beautiful, and full of meaning, a very
message from God to all ladies, to tell them what they ought to be; and not to them only, but
to the poorest woman in the parish; for who is too poor to help her neighbours?

You see there is a difference between a Christian man's duty in this and a Christian woman's
duty, though they both spring from the same spirit.  The man, unless he be a clergyman, has
not so much time as a woman for actually helping his neighbours by acts of charity.  He must
till the ground, sail the seas, attend to his business, fight the Queen's enemies; and the
way in which the Holy Spirit of Charity will show in him will be more in his temper and his
language; by making him patient, cheerful, respectful, condescending, courteous, reasonable,
with every one whom he has to do with:  but the woman has time to show acts of charity which
the man has not.  She can teach in the schools, sit by the sick bed, work with her hands for
the suffering and the helpless, even though she cannot with her head.  Above all, she can give
those kind looks and kind words which comfort the broken heart better than money and bodily
comforts can do.  And she does do it, thank God!  I do not merely mean in such noble instances
of divine charity and self-sacrifice as those ladies who have gone out to nurse the wounded
soldiers in the East--true ladies, indeed, of whom I fear more than one, ere they return, will
be added to the noble army of martyrs, to receive in return for the great love which they have
shown on earth, the full enjoyment of God's love in heaven:--not these only, but poor women--women
who could not write their own names--women who had hardly clothes wherewith to keep themselves
warm--women who were toiling all day long to feed and clothe their own children, till one wondered
when in the twenty-four hours they could find five spare minutes for helping their neighbours;--such
poor women have I seen, who in the midst of their own daily work and daily care, had still
a heart open to hear every one's troubles; a head always planning little comforts and pleasures
for others; and hands always busy in doing good. Instead of being made hard and selfish by
their own troubles, they had been taught by them, as the Lord Jesus was, to feel for the troubles
of all around them, and went about like ministering angels in the Spirit of God, which is peace
on earth and goodwill towards men.

Oh, my friends, such poor women seemed to me most glorious, most honourable, most venerable!
What was all rank or fashion, beauty or accomplishments, when compared with the great honour
which the Lord Jesus Christ was putting upon those poor women, by transforming them thus into
His own most blessed likeness, and giving them grace to go about, as He the Lord Jesus did,
doing good, because God was with them!  This rank neither the whirling wheel of Fortune can
destroy, nor the deceitful cavillings of worldlings separate; neither sickness abate, nor time
abolish.'  No; for it is written, that though prophecies shall fail, tongues cease, knowledge
vanish away, and all that we now know is but in part, yet charity shall never fail those who
are full of the Spirit of Love, but abide with them for ever and ever, bringing forth fruit
through all eternity to everlasting life.

But what sort of virtue?  Do not mistake that.  Not what the world calls virtue; not mere legal
respectability, which says, I do unto others as they do unto me; which is often merely the
whitening outside the sepulchre, and leaves the heart within unrenewed, unrighteous, full of
pride and ambition, conceit, cunning, and envy, and unbelief in God:  not that virtue, but
the virtue which the Apostle tells us to add to our faith, the virtue from above, which is
the same as the wisdom from above, which is first pure, then peaceable, gentle, easy to be
entreated; in one word, the Holy Spirit of God, the Spirit of Divine Love and Charity, which
seeketh not its own, which St. Paul has described to us in this epistle; the Holy Spirit of
God, with which the Lord Jesus was filled without measure, and which He manifested to all the
world in His most blessed life and death.

Ah, my friends, this is not an easy lesson to learn.  Christ's disciples and apostles could
not learn it all at once.  They tried to hinder little children from coming to Him.  They rebuked
the blind man who called after Him.  How could the great Prophet of Nazareth stoop to trouble
Himself about such poor insignificant people?  They could not conceive, either, why the Lord
Jesus should choose to die shamefully, when He might have lived in honour:  it seemed unworthy
of Him.  They were shocked at His words. 'That be far from Thee, Lord,' said Peter.  Afterwards,
when they really understood what that word 'Lord,' meant, and what sort of a man a true and
perfect Lord ought to be, then they saw how fit, and proper, and glorious, Christ's self-sacrifice
was.  When, too, they learnt to look on Him, not merely as a great prophet, but as the Son
of the Living God, then they understood His conduct, and saw that it behoved an only-begotten
Son of God to suffer all these things before He entered into His glory.

But the Scribes and Pharisees never understood it.  To the last they were puzzled and angered
by that very self-sacrifice of His:  He must be a bad man, they thought, or He would not care
so much for bad men.  'A friend of publicans and sinners,' they called Him, thinking that a
shameful blame to Him, while it was really the very highest praise.  But if they could not
see the beauty of His conduct, can we?  It is very difficult, I do not deny it, my friends,
for the selfishness and pride of fallen man:  it is difficult to see that the Cross was the
most glorious throne that was even set up on earth, and that the crown of thorns was worth
all the crowns of czars and emperors:  difficult, indeed, not to stumble at the stumbling-block
of the Cross, and to say, 'It cannot surely be more blessed to give than to receive:' difficult,
not to say in our hearts, 'The way to be great is surely to rise above other men, not to stoop
below them; to make use of them, and not to make ourselves slaves to them.'  And yet the Lord
Jesus Christ did so; He took on Himself the form of a slave, and made Himself of no reputation:
and what was fit and good for Him, must surely be fit and good for us.  But it is a hard lesson
to the pride of fallen creatures:  very hard.  And nothing, I believe, but sorrow will teach
it us:  sorrow is teaching it some of us now.  We surely are beginning to see, that to suffer
patiently for conscience sake, is the most beautiful thing on earth or in heaven:  we begin
to see that those poor soldiers, dying by inches of cold and weariness, without a murmur, because
it was their Duty, were doing a nobler work even than they did when they fought at Alma and
Inkermann; and that those ladies who are drudging in the hospitals, far away from home, amid
filth and pestilence, are doing, if possible, a nobler work still, a nobler work than if they
were queens or empresses, because they have taken up the Cross and followed Christ; because
they are not seeking their own good, but the good of others.  And if we will not learn it from
those glorious examples, God will force us to learn it, I trust, every one of us, by sorrow
and disappointment. Ah, my friends, might one not learn it at once, if one would but open one's
eyes and look at things as they are?  Every one is longing for something; each has his little
plan for himself, of what he would like to be, and like to do, and says to himself all day
long, 'If I could but get that one thing, I should be happy:  If I could but get that, then
I should want no more!'  Foolish man, self- deceived by his own lusts!  Perhaps he cannot get
what he wants, and therefore he cannot enjoy what he has, and is moody, discontented, peevish,
a torment to himself, and perhaps a torment to his family. Or perhaps he does get what he wants:
and is he happy after all? Not he.  He is like the greedy Israelites of old, when they longed
for the quails; and God sent the quails:  but while the meat was yet in their mouths, they
loathed it.  So it is with a man's fancy.  He gets what he fancies; and he plays with it for
a day, as a child with a new toy, and most probably spoils it, and next day throws it away
to run after some new pleasure, which will cheat him in just the same way as the last did;
and so happiness flits away ahead before him; and he is like the simple boy in the parable,
who was to find a crock of gold where the rainbow touched the ground:  but as he moved on,
the rainbow moved on too, and kept always a field off from him.  You may smile:  but just as
foolish is every soul of us, who fancies that he will become happy by making himself great;
admired, rich, comfortable, in short, by making himself anything whatsoever, or getting anything
whatsoever for himself.  Just as foolish is every poor soul, and just as unhappy, as long as
he will go on thinking about himself, instead of copying the Lord Jesus Christ, and thinking
about others; as long as he will keep to the pattern of the old selfish Adam, which is corrupt
according to the deceitful lusts, the longings and fancies which deceive a man into expecting
to be happy when he will not be happy; instead of putting on the new man, which after God's
likeness is created in righteousness and true holiness:  and what is true holiness but that
very charity of which St. Paul has been preaching to us, the spirit of love, and mercy, and
gentleness, and condescension, and patience, and active benevolence?

Ah, my friends, do not forget what I said just now; that a man could not become happy by making
himself anything.  No.  Not by making himself anything:  but he may by letting God make him
something.  If he will let God make him a new creature in Jesus Christ, then he will be more
than happy--he will be blessed:  then he will be a blessing to himself, and a blessing to every
one whom he meets: then all vain longing, and selfishness, and pride, and ambition, and covetousness,
and peevishness and disappointment, will vanish out of his heart, and he will work manfully
and contentedly where God has placed him--cheerful and open-hearted, civil and patient, always
thinking about others, and not about himself; trying to be about his Master's business, which
is doing good; and always finding too, that his Master Christ sets him some good work to do
day by day, and gives him strength to do it.  And how can a man get that blessed and noble
state of mind?  By prayer and practice.  You must ask for strength from God:  but then you
must believe that He answers your prayer, and gives you that strength; and therefore you must
try and use it.  There is no more use in praying without practising than there is in practising
without praying.  You cannot learn to walk without walking:  no more can you learn to do good
without trying to do good.

Ask, then, of God, grace and help to do good:  Pray to Him this very day to take all selfishness
and meanness out of your hearts, and to give you instead His Holy Spirit of Love and Charity,
which alone can make you noble in His sight; and try this day, try every day of your lives,
to do some good to those around you.  Oh make a rule, and pray to God to help you to keep it,
never, if possible, to lie down at night without being able to say, 'I have made one human
being at least a little wiser, or a little happier, or a little better this day.'  You will
find it easier than you think, and pleasanter:  easier, because if you wish to do God's work,
God will surely find you work to do; and pleasanter, because in return for the little trouble
it may cost you, or the little choking of foolish vulgar pride it may cost you, you will have
a peace of mind, a quiet of temper, a cheerfulness and hopefulness about yourself and all around
you, such as you never felt before; and over and above that, if you look for a reward in the
life to come, recollect this--what we have to hope for in the life to come is, to enter into
the joy of our Lord.  And how did He fulfil that joy, but by humbling Himself, and taking the
form of a slave, and coming not to be ministered to but to minister, and to give His whole
life, even to the death upon the cross, a ransom for many?  Be sure, that unless you take up
His cross, you will not share His crown.  Be sure, that unless you follow in His footsteps,
you will never reach the place where He is. If you wish to enter into the joy of your Lord,
be sure that His joy is now, as it was in Judaea of old, over every sinner that repenteth,
every mourner that is comforted, every hungry mouth that is fed, every poor soul, sick or in
prison, who is visited.

That is the joy of your Lord--to show mercy; and that must be your joy too, if you wish to
enter into His joy.  Surely that is plain. You must rejoice in doing the same work that He
rejoices in, and then His joy and yours will be the same; then you will enter into His joy,
and He will enter into yours; then, as St. John says, you will dwell in Christ, and Christ
in you, because you love the brethren; and you will hear through all eternity the blessed words,
'Inasmuch as ye did it unto one of the least of these little ones, ye did it unto Me.'

SERMON XXI.  TOLERATION

[Preached at Bideford, 1854]

Philippians iii. 15, 16.  And if in any thing ye shall be otherwise minded, God shall reveal
even this to you.  Nevertheless, whereto we have already attained, let us walk by the same
rule, let us mind the same thing.

My friends, allow me to speak a few plain and honest words, ere we part, on a matter which
is near to, and probably important to, many of us here.  We all know how the Christian Church
has in all ages been torn in pieces by religious quarrels; we all know too well how painfully
these religious quarrels have been brought home to our very doors and hearts of late.

Now, we all deplore, or profess to deplore, these differences and controversies.  But we may
do that in two ways:  we may say, 'I am very sorry that all Christians do not think alike,'
when all we mean is, 'I am very sorry that all Christians do not think just as I do, for I
am right and infallible, whosoever else is wrong.'  The fallen heart of man is too apt to say
that, my friends, in its pride and narrowness, and while it cries out against the Pope of Rome,
sets itself up as Pope in his stead.

But there is surely another and a better way of deploring these differences:  and that is,
to say to oneself, 'I am sorry, bitterly sorry, that Christians cannot differ without quarrelling
and hating one another over and above.'  And then comes the deeper home- thought, 'And how
much more sorry I am that I myself cannot differ from my fellow-Christians without growing
angry with them, suspecting them, despising them, treating them as if they were not my fellow-Christians
at all.'  Yes, my friends, this is what we have to do first when we think of religious controversies,
to examine our own hearts and deeds and words; to see whether we too have not been making bitterness
more bitter, and, as the old proverb says, 'stirring the fire with a sword;' and to repent
humbly and utterly of every harsh word, hasty judgment, ungenerous suspicion, as sins, not
only against men, but against God the Father of Lights, who worketh in each of His children
to will and to do of His good pleasure.

But some will say, 'We cannot give up what we believe to be right and true.'  God forbid that
you should try to do so, my friends; for if you really believe it, you cannot, even if you
try; and by trying you will only make yourselves dishonest.  But does not that hold as good
of the man who differs from you?  God will not surely lay down one law for you, and another
for him?  'But we are right, and he is wrong.'  Be it so.  You do not surely mean that you
are quite right; perfect and infallible?  You mean that you are right on the whole, and as
far as you see.  And how can you tell but that he is right on the whole, and as far as he sees?
You will answer that both cannot be right; that yes and no cannot be both true; that a thing
cannot be black and white also.

My friends, my friends--but where is the religious controversy, the two sides whereof are as
clearly opposite to each other as yes and no, black and white?  I know none now; I have hardly
found one in the records of the Protestant Church since first Luther and our Reformers protested
against Romish idolatry.  On that last matter there should be no doubt, as long as the first
two commandments stand in the Decalogue; but, with that exception, it would be difficult to
find a dispute in which the truth lay altogether with one party.  The truth rather lies, in
general, not so much halfway between the two combatants, as in some third place, which neither
of them sees; which perhaps God does not intend them to see in this life, while He leaves his
servants each to work out some one side of Christian truth, dividing to every man severally
as He will, according to the powers of each mind, and the needs of each situation.

True we have the infallible rule of Scripture:  but are our own interpretations of it so sure
to be infallible?  Inspired, infinite, inexhaustible as it is, can we pretend to have fathomed
all its abysses, to have comprehended all its boundless treasures?  The pretence is folly.
True, again, it contains all things necessary to salvation; and those so plainly set forth,
that he who runs may read, and the wayfaring man, though poor, shall not err therein. And yet
does it not contain things whereof even St. Paul himself said, that he only knew in part, and
prophesied in part, and saw as through a glass darkly; and are we to suppose that they are
among the truths necessary to salvation?  Now are not the points about which there has been,
and is still, most dispute, just of this very number?  Do they belong to the simple fundamental
truths of the Gospel? Right is the perjurer, and the thief, and have a s. There is latter god, and
he hopes to propulsion out to that pork. He is then use Christie to clout his the chestnuts

Two illustration-- the from the father-- emerged into the beam, and

And if God be with them, who dare be against them?  Shall we be more dainty than God?  And
therefore I have never been able to hear, without a shudder, words which I have heard, and
from really Christian men too:  'I can wish well to a pious man of a different denomination
from mine; I can honour and admire the fruits of God's Spirit in him; but I cannot co-operate
with him.'  When I hear such language from really good men, I confess I am puzzled.  I have
no doubt that their reasons seem to them very sound; but what they are I cannot conceive. 
I cannot conceive why I should not hold out the right hand of fellowship and brotherhood to
every man who fears God and works righteousness, of whatsoever denomination he may be.  We
believe the Apostles' Creed, surely?  Then think of the meaning of that one word, The Holy
Spirit.  To whom are we to attribute any man's good deeds, except to the Holy Spirit?  We dare
not say that he does them by an innate and natural virtue of his own, for that would be to
fall at once into the Pelagian heresy; neither dare we attribute his good deeds to an evil
spirit, and say, 'However good they may look, they must be bad, for he belongs to a denomination
who cannot have God's Spirit.'  We dare not; for that would be to approach fearfully near to
the unpardonable sin itself, the sin against the Holy Ghost, the bigotry which says, 'He casteth
out devils by the Prince of the devils.'  Surely if we be Christians, and Churchmen, we confess
(for the Bible and the Prayer- book declare) that every good deed of man comes down from the
One Fountain of Good, from God, the Father of Lights, by the inspiration of His Holy Spirit.

Then think, my friends, think what words we have said.  We confess that the great, absolute,
almighty, eternal God, in whose hand suns and stars, ages and generations, hell and heaven,
and all which is and has been, and ever will be, are but as a grain of sand; who has but to
take away His breath, and the whole universe would become nothing and nowhere; the utterly
holy and righteous God, who is of purer eyes than to behold iniquity, who charges His angels
with folly, and the heavens are not clean in His sight--we confess, I say, that this great
God has condescended to visit that man's soul, and cherish it, and teach it, and shape it (be
it ever so little) into His own likeness:  and shall we dare to stand aloof from him from whom
God does not stand aloof?  Shall we refuse to walk with one who walks with God?  Shall we refuse
to work with one who is a fellow-worker with God, to love one whom God loves, to take by the
hand one whose guest God has become?  Shall we be more dainty than God? more fastidious than
God? more righteous than God? more separate from sinners than God?  Oh, my friends, let us
pray that we may love God better, and know His likeness more clearly; that we may be more ready
to recognise, and admire, and welcome every, even the smallest trace of that likeness in any
human being, remembering that it is the likeness of Christ, who was not merely The Teacher
of all in every nation who fear God and work righteousness, but the Saviour who ate and drank
with publicans and sinners:  and then we shall be more careful how we call unclean what God
Himself has cleansed with His own presence, His own grace, His own quickening and renewing
and sanctifying Spirit.

Be sure, be sure, my friends, that in proportion as we really love the Lord Jesus Christ, we
shall love those who love Him, be it in never so clumsy or mistaken a fashion; and love those
too whom He loved enough to die for them, and whom He loves now enough to teach and strengthen.
We shall say to them, not 'Wherein do we differ?' but 'Wherein do we agree?'  Not, 'Because
I cannot worship with you, therefore I will not work with you;' but rather, 'I wish that I
could worship with you; I will whenever and wherever I can, as far as you allow me, as far
as the law allows me, as far as your worship is not in my eyes an actually sinful thing:  but,
be that as it may, we can at least do together something better even than worshipping, and
that is, working.  We can surely do good together.  Together, let our denomination or party
be what it may, we can feed the hungry, clothe the naked, reform the prisoner, humanize the
degraded, save yearly the lives of thousands by labouring for the public health, and educate
the minds and morals of the masses, though our religious differences (shame on us that it should
be so!) force us to part when we begin to talk to them about the world to come.'

For are we not brothers after all?  Has not God made us of one blood, English men, with English
hearts?  Has not Christ redeemed us with one and the same sacrifice?  Has not the Holy Spirit
given us one and the same desire of doing good?  And shall we not use that spirit hand in hand?
Look, look at the opportunities of doing good which are around you; look at God's field of
good works, white already to the harvest; and the labourers are few.  Shall these few, instead
of going manfully to work, stand idly quarrelling about the shape of their instruments, and
their favourite modes of using them? God forbid!  True, there are errors against which we are
bound to protest to the uttermost; but how few?  The one real enemy we have all to fight is
sin--evil-doing.  If any man or doctrine makes men worse--makes men do worse deeds, protest
then, if you will, and spare not, and shrink not:  for sin must be of the Devil, whatever else
is not.  And therefore we are bound to protest against any doctrine which parts man from God,
and, under whatsoever pretence of reverence or purity, draws again the veil between him and
his Heavenly Father, and denies him free access to the Throne of Grace, and the feet of Jesus,
that he may carry thither his own sins, his own doubts, his own sorrows, and speak (wondrous
condescension of redeeming grace!) speak with God face to face, and yet live.  For this we
must protest; for this we must die, if needs be; for if we lose this, we lose all which our
reforming forefathers won for us at the stake, ay, we lose our own souls; for we lose righteousness
and strength, and the power to do the will of God.

For to shut a man out from free access to God and Christ is to make him certainly false, dishonest,
cowardly, degraded, slavish, and sinful; as modern Popery has made, and always will make, those
over whom it really gains power.  This is the root of our hereditary protest against Popery;
not merely because we do not agree with certain of its doctrines, but because we know from
experience, that as now taught by the Jesuits, with whom it has identified itself, its general
tendency is to make men bad men, ignorant, dishonest, rebellious; unworthy citizens of a free
and loyal state.

And there are practices against which congregations have a right to protest, not only as Christians,
but as free Englishmen. Congregations have a right to protest against any minister who introduces
obsolete ceremonies which empty his church and drive away his people.  Those ceremonies may
be quite harmless in themselves, as I really believe most of them are; many of them may be
beautiful, and, if properly understood, useful, as I think they are; but a thing may be good
in itself, and yet become bad by being used at a wrong time, and in a way which produces harm.
And it is shocking, to say the least, to see churches emptied and parishes thrown into war
for the sake of such matters.  The lightest word which can be used for such conduct is, pedantry;
but I fear at times lest the Lord in heaven should be using a far more awful word, and when
He sees weak brethren driven from the fold of the Church by the self- will and obstinacy of
the very men who profess to desire to bring all into the Church, as the only place where salvation
is to be found,--I fear, I say, when I see such deeds, lest the Lord should repeat against
them His own awful words:  'If any man scandalize one of these little ones who believeth on
Me, it were better for him that a millstone were hanged about his neck, and that he were drowned
in the depths of the sea.'  What sadder mistake?  Those who have sworn to seek out Christ's
lambs scattered up and down this wicked world, shall they be the very ones to frighten those
lambs out of the fold, instead of alluring them back into it?  Shall the shepherd play the
part, not even of the hireling who flees and leaves the sheep to themselves, but of the very
wolf who scatters the flock?  God forbid!  The Church, like the Sabbath, was made for man,
my friends:  not man for the Church; and the Son of Man, as He is Lord of the Sabbath, is Lord
of the Church, and will have mercy in its dealings rather than sacrifice.  The minister, my
friends, was made for the people:  and not the people for the minister.  What else does the
very name 'minister' mean?  Oh, my friends, who can read honestly that glorious First Epistle
to the Corinthians and not see how a man may have the most intense earnestness, the strongest
doctrinal certainty, and yet at the same time the greatest freedom, and charity, and liberality
about minor matters of ceremonies and Church arrangements, and practical methods of usefulness;
glad even that Christ be preached by his enemies, and out of spite to him, because any way
Christ is preached?

But, my friends, if it is the right of free Englishmen to protest against such doings, how
shall it be done?  Surely in gentleness, calmness, reverence, as by men who know that they
are standing on holy ground, and dealing with sacred things, before the Throne of God, and
beneath the eye of Jesus Christ.  Not surely, as it has been too often done, in bitterness,
and wrath, and clamour, and evil-speaking, with really unjust suspicions, exaggerations, slanders,
(and those, too, anonymous,) in the columns of the public prints.  My friends, these are not
God's weapons.  Not such is Ithuriel's magic spear, the very touch of which unmasks falsehood.
This is to try to cast out Satan by Satan, to make evil worse by fighting it with fresh evil.
Oh, my friends, if there is one counsel which I would press on all here more earnestly than
another, it is this--never, never, howsoever great may be the temptation, to indulge in anonymous
attacks on any human being.  No man has a right to do it who prays daily to his Father in heaven,
Lead us not into temptation.  For it is to lead oneself into temptation, and that too sore
to resist; into the temptation to say something which one dare not say, and ought not to say,
were one's name known; the temptation to forget not only the charity of Christians, but even
the courtesies of civilized life; and to shoot, from behind the safe hedge of anonymousness,
coward and envenomed shafts, of which we should be ashamed, did the world know that they were
ours; of which we shall surely be ashamed in that great day, when the secrets of all hearts
shall be disclosed.  I speak strongly:  but only because I know by bitter experience the terrible
truth of my own words.

And consider, my friends, can any good result come from handling sacred matters with such harsh
and fierce hands as they have been handled of late?  For ourselves, such evil tempers only
excite, irritate, blind us:  they prevent our doing justice to the opposite side--(I speak
of all parties)--they put us into an unwholesome state of suspicion, and tempt us to pass harsh
judgments upon men as righteous, and perhaps far more righteous, than ourselves:  they stir
up our pride to special plead our case, to make the best of our own side, and the worst of
our opponents':  they defile our very prayers; till, when we ought to be praying God to bless
all mankind, we catch ourselves unawares calling on Him to curse our enemies.

I have been asked to preach in behalf of the Provident Society of this town.  I shall begin
by asking you to think over with me a matter which may seem at first sight to have very little
to do with you or with a provident society, but which, nevertheless, I believe has very much
to do with both, and is full of wholesome spiritual instruction for us all.

Did it ever happen to any of you, to see a mob of several thousands put to instant flight by
a mere handful of soldiers?  And did you ever ask yourself how that apparent miracle could
come to pass?  The first answer which occurred to you, perhaps, was, that the soldiers were
well armed, and the mob was not:  but soon, I am sure, you felt that you were doing the soldiers
an injustice; that they would have behaved just as bravely if every man in that mob had been
as well armed as they, and have resisted till they were overpowered by mere numbers.  You felt,
I am sure, that there was something in the hearts and spirits of those soldiers which there
was not in the hearts of the mob; that though the mob might be boiling over with the greediest
passions, the fiercest fury, while the soldiers were calm, cheerful, and caring for nothing
but doing their duty, yet that there was a thought within them which was stronger than all
the rage and greediness of the thousands whom they faced; that, in short, the seeming miracle
was a moral and a spiritual miracle.

What, then, is this wonder-working thought which makes the soldier strong?

Courage, you answer, and the sense of duty.  True; but what has called out the sense of duty?
What has inspired the courage?  There was a time, perhaps, when each of those soldiers was
no braver or more steady than the mob in front of them.  Has it never happened to you to know
some young country lad, both before and after he has become a soldier?  Look at him in his
native village (if you will let me draw for you the sketch of a history, which, alas! is the
history of thousands), perhaps one of the worst and idlest lads in it--unwilling to work steadily,
haunting the public-house and the worst of company; wandering out at night to poach and caring
for nothing but satisfying his gross animal appetites; afraid to look you in the face, hardly
able to give an intelligible, certainly not a civil answer; his countenance expressing only
vacancy, sensuality, cunning, suspicion, utter want of self-respect.

  You talk to him, and find that the change is not
merely outward, but inward; not owing to mere mechanical drill but to something which has been
going on in his heart; and ten to one, the first thing that he begins to talk to you about,
with honest pride, is his regiment.  His regiment.  Yes, there is the secret which has worked
these wonders; there is the talisman which has humanized and civilized and raised from the
mire the once savage boor.  He belongs to a regiment; in one word, he has become the member
of a body.

The member of a body, in which if one member suffers, all suffer with it; if one member be
honoured, all rejoice with it.  A body, which has a life of its own, and a government of its

  Members of Christ--we, and
the poor for whom I plead, as well as we; perhaps, considering their many trials and our few
trials, more faithfully and loyally by far than we are.  There are some here, I doubt not,
to whom that word, that argument, is enough:  to whom it is enough to say, Remember that the
Lord whom you love loves that shivering, starving wretch as well as He loves you, to open and
exhaust at once their heart, their purse, their labour of love.  God's blessing be upon all
such!  But it would be hypocrisy in me, my friends, to speak to this, or any congregation,
as if all were of that temper of mind.  It is not one in ten, alas! in the present divided
state of religious parties, who feels the mere name of Christ enough of a bond to make him
sacrifice himself for his fellow Christians, as a soldier does for his fellow soldiers.  Not
one in ten, alas! feels that he owes the same allegiance to Christ as the soldier does to his
Queen; that the honour of Christianity is his honour, the history of Christianity his history,
the life of Christianity his life.  Would that it were so:  but it is not so.  And I must appeal
to feelings in you less wide, honourable and righteous though they are:  I must appeal to your
public spirit as townsmen of this place.

I have a right as a clergyman to do so:  I have a duty as a clergyman to do so.  For your being
townsmen of this place is not a mere material accident depending on your living in one house
instead of another.  It is a spiritual matter; it is a question of eternity. Your souls and
spirits influence each other; your tastes, opinions, tempers, habits, make those of your neighbours
better or worse; you feel it in yourselves daily.  Look at it as a proof that, whether you
will or not, you are one body, of which all the members must more or less suffer and rejoice
together; that you have a common weal, a common interest; that God has knit you together; that
you cannot part yourselves even if you will; and that you can be happy and prosperous only
by acknowledging each other as brothers, and by doing to each other as you would they should
do unto you.

It may be hard at times to bring this thought home to our minds: but it is none the less true
because we forget it; and if we do not choose to bring it home to our own minds, it will be
sooner or later brought home to them whether we choose or not.

For bear in mind, that St. Paul does not say, if one member suffers, all the rest ought to
suffer with it:  he says that they do suffer with it.  He does not say merely, that we ought
to feel for our fellow townsmen; he says, that God has so tempered the body together as to
force one member to have the same care of the others as of itself; that if we do not care to
feel for them, we shall be made to feel with them.  One limb cannot choose whether or not it
will feel the disease of another limb.  If one limb be in pain, the whole body must be uneasy,
whether it will or not.  And if one class in a town, or parish, or county, be degraded, or
in want, the whole town, or parish, or county, must be the worse for it.  St. Paul is not preaching
up sentimental sympathy:  he is telling you of a plain fact.  He is not saying, 'It is a very
fine and saintly thing, and will increase your chance of heaven, to help the poor.'  He is
saying, 'If you neglect the poor, you neglect yourself; if you degrade the poor, you degrade
yourself.  His poverty, his carelessness, his immorality, his dirt, his ill-health, will punish
you; for you and he are members of the same body, knit together inextricably for weal or woe,
by the eternal laws according to which the Lord Jesus Christ has constituted human society;
and if you break those laws, they will avenge themselves.'--My friends, do we not see them
avenge themselves daily?  The slave-holder refuses to acknowledge that his slave is a member
of the same body as himself; but he does not go unpunished:  the degradation to which he has
brought his slave degrades him, by throwing open to him. the downward path of lust, laziness,
ungoverned and tyrannous tempers, and the other sins which have in all ages, slowly but surely,
worked the just ruin of slave-holding states.  The sinner is his own tempter, and the sinner
is his own executioner:  he lies in wait for his own life (says Solomon) when he lies in wait
for his brother's. Do you see the same law working in our own free country?  If you leave the
poor careless and filthy, you can obtain no good servants: if you leave them profligate, they
make your sons profligate also: if you leave them tempted by want, your property is unsafe:
if you leave them uneducated, reckless, improvident, you cannot get your work properly done,
and have to waste time and money in watching your workmen instead of trusting them.  Why, what
are all poor-rates and county-rates, if you will consider, but God's plain proof to us, that
the poor are members of the same body as ourselves; and that if we will not help them of our
own free will, we shall find it necessary to help them against our will:  that if we will not
pay a little to prevent them becoming pauperized or criminal, we must pay a great deal to keep
them when they have become so?  We may draw a lesson--and a most instructive one it is--from
the city of Liverpool, in which it was lately proved that crime--and especially the crime of
uneducated boys and girls--had cost, in the last few years, the city many times more than it
would cost to educate, civilize, and depauperize the whole rising generation of that city,
and had been a tax upon the capital and industry of Liverpool, so enormous that they would
have submitted to it from no Government on earth; and yet they had been blindly inflicting
it upon themselves for years, simply because they chose to forget that they were their brothers'
keepers.

Look again at preventible epidemics, like cholera.  All the great towns of England have discovered,
what you I fear are discovering also, that the expense of a pestilence, and of the widows and
orphans which it creates, is far greater than the expense of putting a town into such a state
of cleanliness as would defy the entrance of the disease.  So it is throughout the world. 
Nothing is more expensive than penuriousness; nothing more anxious than carelessness; and every
duty which is bidden to wait, returns with seven fresh duties at its back.

Yes, my friends, we are members of a body; and we must realize that fact by painful experience,
if we refuse to realize it in public spirit and brotherly kindness, and the approval of a good
conscience, and the knowledge that we are living like our Lord and Master Jesus Christ, who
laboured for all but Himself, cared for all but Himself; who counted not His own life dear
to Himself that by laying it down He might redeem into His own likeness the beings whom He
had made; and who has placed us on this earth, each in his own station, each in his own parish,
that we might follow in His footsteps, and live by His Spirit, which is the spirit of love
and fellow-feeling, that new and risen life of His, which is the life of duty, honour, and
self-sacrifice.

Some dislike appeals to honour.  I cannot, as long as St. Paul himself appeals to it so often,
both in the individual and in bodies.  His whole Epistle to Philemon is an appeal, most delicate
and graceful, to Philemon's sense of honour--to the thought of what he owed Paul, of what Paul
wished him to repay, not with money, but with generosity.

And his appeal to the Corinthians is a direct appeal to their honour:  not to fears of any
punishment, or wrath of God, but to the respect which they owed to themselves as members of
a body, the Church of Corinth; and to the respect which they owed to that body as a whole,
and which they had disgraced by allowing an open scandal in it.

And his appeal was successful:  they took it just as it was meant; and he rejoices in the thought
that they did so.  In all things you have approved yourselves to be clear in this matter,'

Noble words, and nobly answered.  My friends, you, too, are members of a body:  go, and do
likewise in the matter of this Society's failing funds.

May I boldly ask you to alter this to-day?  This, remember, is no common day.  It is a day
of thankfulness.  The thankfulness which you professed, and I doubt not many of you felt, on
Thursday night, has not evaporated, I trust, by Sunday morning.  You have not yet forgotten--I
trust that there is many a one who will never forget-- what you owe as townsmen of this place,
to God who has preserved you safe through the dangers and sorrows of the past autumn.  You
owe more than one debt to God.  You owe, all England owes, thanks to Him for the late bounteous
harvest, thanks to Him for the present prosperous seed-time:  think what our state might have
been with scarcity, as well as war, upon us, and pay part of your debt this day.  You owe a
thank-offering for the cessation of the cholera; a thank-offering for the sparing of your own
lives;--pay it now.  You owe a thank-offering for the glorious victories of our armies:--pay
it now.  You belong, too, to an honourable body, which has a noble history, and sets you many
a noble example; show yourselves worthy of that body, that history, those examples, now.

And what fitter place than this very church to awaken within you the thought of duty and of
public spirit?--this church which stands as God's own sign that you are the townsmen, the representatives,
ay, some of you the very descendants, of many a noble spirit of old time?--this church, in
which God's blessing has been invoked on deeds of patriotism and enterprise, of which the whole
world now bears the fruit?--these walls, in which Elizabeth's heroes, your ancestors, have
prayed before sailing against the Spanish Armada,-- these walls, which saw the baptism of the
first red Indian convert, and the gathering in, as it were, of the firstfruits of the heathen,--these
walls, in which the early settlers of Virginia have invoked God's blessing on those tiny ventures
which were destined to become the seeds of a mighty nation, and the starting-point of the United
States,--these walls, which still bear the monument of your heroic townsman Strange, who expended
for his plague-stricken brethren, talents, time, wealth, and at last life itself. The publication
will be receive by another person of epos. Title. Stoddard is the thought of future genius,

  Be it so.
I shall be glad if you think so.  If the matter be so small, it is the more easily done; if
the sum be paltry, it is the more easily found.  If my reasons are very huge and loud- sounding,
and the result at which I aim very light, the result ought to follow all the more certainly;
for believe me, my friends, the reasons are good ones, Scriptural ones, practical ones, and
ought to produce the result.  I give you the strongest arguments for showing your Christian,
English public spirit; and then I ask you to show it in a very small matter.  But be sure that
to do what I ask of you to do to-day is just as much your duty, small as it may seem, as it
would be, were you soldiers, to venture your lives in the cause of your native land.  Duty,
be it in a small matter or a great, is duty still; the command of Heaven, the eldest voice
of God.  And, believe me, my friends, that it is only they who are faithful in a few things
who will be faithful over many things; only they who do their duty in everyday and trivial
matters who will fulfil them on great occasions.  We all honour and admire the heroes of Alma
and Balaklava; we all trust in God that we should have done our duty also in their place. 
The best test of that, my friends, is, can we do our duty in our own place?  Here the duty
is undeniable, plain, easy.  Here is a Society instituted for one purpose, which has, in order
to exist, to appropriate the funds destined for quite a different purpose.  Both purposes are
excellent; but they are different.  The Offertory money is meant for the sick, the widow, and
the orphan; for those who cannot help themselves.  The Provident Society is meant to encourage
those who can help themselves to do so.  Every farthing, therefore, taken from the Offertory
money is taken from the widow and the orphan.  I ask you whether this is right and just? A thought
he must not be each road, and ventured through break but the silence there is called before question:
"might you answer me how prolonged it will be inspired with them reach
Sheridan?" The conductor, nodded at him, and passed on.  Again, I say, this may seem a small matter to you, and I may seem to be using too
many words about it.  Small?  Nothing is small which affects not merely the temporal happiness,
but the eternal welfare, of an immortal soul.  My friends, my friends, if any one of you had
to support yourself and your children on four, seven, or even (mighty sum!) ten shillings a
week, it would not seem a small matter to you then.  A few shillings more or less would be
to you then a treasure won or lost; a matter to you of whether you should keep a house over
your children's heads, whether you should keep shoes upon their feet, and clothes upon their
backs; whether you should see them, as they grew up, tempted by want into theft or profligacy;
whether you should rise in the morning free enough from the sickening load of anxiety, and
the care which eats out the core of life, and makes men deaf and blind (as it does many a one)
to all pleasant sights, and sounds, and thoughts, till the very sunlight seems blotted out
of heaven by that black cloud of care--care--care-- which rises with you in the morning, and
dogs you at your work all day (even if you are happy enough to have work), and sits on your
pillow all night long, ready to whisper in your ear each time you wake; 'Be anxious and troubled
about many things! You were missives such as a wife might compose upon a short absent, had hitherto
of a ngo to deep had this interest to both. This same must have been
the man's name, that the letters to the then begin occasionally "dear Faculty."
 For thou hast no Heavenly Father, none above who knowest that thou needest these
things before thou askest Him.'  Oh, my friends, if you had felt but for a single day, that
terrible temptation, the temptation of poverty, and debt, and care, which leads so many a one
to sell their souls for a few paltry pence, to them of as much value as pounds would be to
you;--if, I say, you had once felt that temptation in all its weight, you would not merely
sacrifice, as I ask you now to do, some superfluity, which you will never miss; you would,
I do believe, if you had human hearts within you, be ready to sacrifice even the comforts of
life to prevent him whose heart may be breaking slowly, not a hundred yards from your own door,
(and more hearts break in this world than you fancy, my friends,) from passing through that
same dark shadow of want, and care, and temptation where the Devil stands calling to the poor
man all day long, 'Fall down, and worship me; and I will relieve those wants of thine which
man neglects!'
