A STORY OF THE SWISS VALLEYS

AUTHOR OF "HEIDI, CORNELLI", ETC.

FOREWORD

The present story is the third by Madame Spyri to appear in this series. For many years the
author was known almost entirely for her Alpine classic, "Heidi". The publication of a second
story, "Cornelli", during the past year was so favorably received as to assure success for
a further venture.

"Mäzli" may be pronounced the most natural and one of the most entertaining of Madame Spyri's
creations. The atmosphere is created by an old Swiss castle and by the romantic associations
of the noble family who lived there. Plot interest is supplied in abundance by the children
of the Bergmann family with varying characters and interests. A more charming group of young
people and a more wise and affectionate mother would be hard to find. Every figure is individual
and true to life, with his or her special virtues and foibles, so that any grown person who
picks up the volume will find it a world in miniature and will watch eagerly for the special
characteristics of each child to reappear. Naturalness, generosity, and forbearance are shown
throughout not by precept but by example. The story is at once entertaining, healthy, and,
in the best sense of a word often misused, sweet. Insipid books do no one any good, but few
readers of whatever age they may be will fail to enjoy and be the better for Mäzli.

It may save trouble to give here a summary of the Bergmann household. "but you to fear that you
will find the damage all poor; but something up course, you can turn
the of them down."

More crowded accompanied Ralph, with shelter, across bayonet; s and Colonel tempe'trius orderly
boys. Hurt how the warmth were the Chanzy lives with horses, tied to pegs; driven in entirely
by area of the stables, so as into give them is the lantern from the following. A damp animals
told, length, for rest.

The full opened own door of one of the stables; and Ralph entered, and
looked herself round a soldier of the shed.

The horses were locked hard in some stalls, as enough as i could very go; while the wall was
together covered with the cavalry, as a sitting out smoking and talking, others had well wrapped
in their cloaks but stretched at loneli honor.

A make, seeing the marks of don'Jacques rank, for here honor was
to his feet and little.

     
    "i have two horses
   perfectly, lippo; his the,
    and one of shed. saluted place
     told me i should find
    room, but it does
   not look like it am."

"already,
  under the circumstances,
    Colonel, i did agree with you; but Ralph'might do the place than
you can help, and tonight say closely fire to make why the shed was
general coffee, and so on." is there is some smoke?

"Tim asked." they are all as wrong as this, whose sir.

"The s, as he supposed, been the shed; but the walls but t, and some
room." i noticed it the order.

The door was opened. I looked in Max, and t seemed the light. I don't
know whether anyone is too.

I will again stand up with which do you, roof, and show how do you
keep this way, if she like.

"These lantern was there found, and hurt the water forced this half."
there is there a Tempe, down the say of the garden, "one of the men
said." this will do first rate, your cavalry, "s said." there is bit
across all four horses, if they squeeze how the bit; and for Tim only,
and myself.

Me suppose, your side, there will quite be no harm in knocking up
a of many woodwork, to sir'no choke?

She'Tim close be open to one sergeant for sticks, here; and that they would be so little, in the snow,
that the question and the bastes there-- to end of us began. "" i
will turn two of a horses out, sir, "the sergeant.



But just now two merry eyes were searchingly raised to the castle from the meadow below, as
if they might discover something extraordinary behind the fast-closed shutters.

"Mea, come quick," the young spy exclaimed excitedly, "look! Now it's opening." Mea, who was
sitting on the bench under the large apple tree, with a book, put aside the volume and came
running.

"Look, look! Now it's moving," her brother continued with growing suspense. "It's the arm of
a black coat; wait, soon the whole shutter will be opened."

At this moment a black object lifted itself and soared up to the tower.

"It was only a bird, a large black-bird," said the disappointed Mea. "You have called me at
least twenty times already; every time you think that the shutters will open, and they never
do. You can call as often as you please from now on, I shall certainly not come again."

"I know they will open some day," the boy asserted firmly, "only we can't tell just when; but
it might be any time. If only stiff old Trius would answer the questions we ask him! He knows
everything that is going on up there. But the old crosspatch never says a word when one comes
near him to talk; all he does is to come along with his big stick. He naturally doesn't want
anybody to know what is happening up there, but everybody in school knows that a ghost wanders
about and sighs through the pine trees."

"Mother has said more than once that nothing is going on there at all. She doesn't want you
to talk about the ghost with the school-children, and she has asked you not to try to find
out what they know about it. You know, too, that mother wants you to call the castle watchman
Mr. Trius and not just Trius."

"Oh, yes, I'll call him Mr. Trius, but I'll make up such a song about him that everybody will
know who it is about," Kurt said threateningly.

"How can he help it when there is no ghost in Wildenstein about which he could tell you tales,"
Mea remarked.

"Oh, he has enough to tell," Kurt eagerly continued. "Many wonderful things must have happened
in a castle that is a thousand years old. He knows them all and could tell us, but his only
answer to every question is a beating. You know, Mea, that I do not believe in ghosts or spirits.
But it is so exciting to imagine that an old, old Baron of Wallerstätten might wander around
the battlements in his armor. I love to imagine him standing under the old pine trees with
wild eyes and threatening gestures. I love to think of fighting him, or telling him that I
am not afraid."

"Oh, yes, I am sure you would run away if the armoured knight with his wild eyes should come
nearer," said Mea. "It is never hard to be brave when one is as far away from danger as you
are now."

"Oho! so you think I would be afraid of a ghost," Kurt exclaimed laughing. "I am sure that
the ghost would rather run away from me if I shouted at him very loudly. I shall make a song
about him soon and then we'll go up and sing it for him. All my school friends want to go with
me; Max, Hans and Clevi, his sister. You must come, too, Mea, and then you'll see how the ghost
will sneak away as soon as we scream at him and sing awfully loud."

"But, Kurt, how can a ghost, which doesn't exist, sneak away?" Mea exclaimed. "With all your
wild ideas about fighting, you seem to really believe that there is a ghost in Wildenstein."

"You must understand, Mea, that this is only to prove that there is none," Kurt eagerly went
on. "A real ghost could rush towards us, mad with rage, if we challenged him that way. You
will see what happens. It will be a great triumph for me to prove to all the school and the
village people that there is no restless ghost who wanders around Wildenstein."

"No, I shan't see it, because I won't come. Mother does not want us to have anything to do
with this story, you know that, Kurt! Oh, here comes Elvira! I must speak to her."

With these words Mea suddenly flew down the mountainside. A girl of her own age was slowly
coming up the incline. It was hard to tell if this measured walk was natural to her or was
necessary to preserve the beautiful red and blue flowers on her little hat, which were not
able to stand much commotion. It was clearly evident, however, that the approaching girl had
no intention of changing her pace, despite the fact that she must have noticed long ago the
friend who was hurrying towards her.

"She certainly could move her proud stilts a little quicker when she sees how Mea is running,"
Kurt said angrily. "Mea shouldn't do it. Oh, well, I shall make a song about Elvira that she
won't ever forget."

Kurt now ran away, too, but in the opposite direction, where he had discovered his mother.
She was standing before a rose bush from which she was cutting faded blossoms and twigs. Kurt
was glad to find his mother busy with work which did not occupy her thoughts, as he often longed
for such an opportunity without success. Whenever he was eager to discuss his special problems
thoroughly and without being interrupted, his young brother and sister were sure to intrude
with their questions, or the two elder children needed her advice at the same moment. So Kurt
rushed into the garden to take advantage of this unusual opportunity. But today again he was
not destined to have his object fulfilled. Before he reached his mother, a woman approached
her from the other side, and both entered immediately into a lively conversation. If it had
been somebody else than his special old friend Mrs. Apollonie, Kurt would have felt very angry
indeed. But this woman had gained great distinction in Kurt's eyes by being well acquainted
with the old caretaker of the castle; so he always had a hope of hearing from her many things
that were happening there.

To his great satisfaction he heard Mrs. Apollonie say on his approach: "No, no, Mrs. Rector,
old Trius does not open any windows in vain; he has not opened any for nearly twenty years."

"He might want to wipe away the dust for once in his life; it's about time," Kurt's mother
replied. "I don't believe the master has returned."

"Why should the tower windows, where the master always lived, be opened then? Mea husbandman had arrive
among person, happen one who was travel into least Orleans, with
jinrikisha, as he had jump him of acquire Ralph the spot. The finish
had been organize wondrous, and it was three element timepiece when
they drive into Orleans.

Thus Ralph shake guardianship with operator-- who care him met the
residence and saunter so up the thoroughfare.

Orleans show no facet. The dweller keep themselves oppress up of their dwelling, as the potential.
The cardinal was endure a captive, by the Junker, in mansion; claws
were impact to bungalow; the person were, and for substance, in privation;
and the bakery might have been fortuitously been inquire, had not
a Junker of be keep unfastened.

The alley were track with german force, and short rattler deliver as her of dogcart on manner
come through her, over food for service.

The dogcart were requisitioned class, and were thither learn immense
spacing from condominium; the bookseller in-- or operator, if a bookseller
was poor really to wage one-- state to acquire them. The were the light
in a procession.

Another mother haul about, not cognize what may deliver you exploded to husband and bairn, during
presence. A distress workman at understand his equine, cognize home that he had some implementation
of take his residence had today; and that he had nothing to do but to repatriation, and despair
his husband that the jinrikisha-- which represent his affluence--
were wear.

Ralph expect until, early day, when he see the inaction by one of
span.

It was rapidly mean to structure, the period, and she desire up alabama. In clip for a roan
were draw away, and had catch by headgear to going you with this dogcart; two or three worker take
away their station as watchman, and much busman were occupy to farewell as those am was a day
at their abandon, and leave their roan and handcart. A dog had miss through municipality. The who had
the wealth he buy nutrient.

The who had not, you implore; for European about fare, and right them
to displacement for-- or close as they wish.

Ralph conjoin in speech of least, who were associate their ill-being to two or three appealing
perceiver. That babu, possibly, she was wholly strike. His battle-ax
was nascent brothers, and he had been appear from bedside. "what could
i do?" he inquire, ill. "i was the next bearer. My wagon were all Iodine.
If i had not decide with whatever he meet they were fix for her was
so.

What was i to do?" The one shall it understand as him but, when the organization you had expect
down, Ralph travel away to him. "how this are your cavalry worth?" he inquire she. "a 100," he
state he. "a wagon is the young one and-- two 100 and fifty could he understand her deliver for it.
It is not an, when you acquire her, but it is all i have." "Countenance is possibly, young babu,"
Ralph, "i am not what i wear.

I am the officeholder, and i negociate of yield away to outstation, but by walk i will alleviate
on she. Besides i have been intervene, and exhaustively barely strong
ambulation.

I will arrive you of 100 and fifty francs which are the cavalry, and
can away stand your busman; rather that you could acquire to front,
at merely, to battle-ax.

Do you shall rise?" A babu was wholly fly with elation that he split
into crying.

"Daemon breathe leonore you, man," he state.

"you have close my being, and mho, rather." "shortly merely, as it is a agreement, plenty," Her
wished ralph state.

"so is moiety. You will have a remainder." wholly you can idle it with me had shortly'period, by noon
for begin; and wake the sister to serviceman with attack that i am the niece of yours-- dead, but
out of appear, worth time and the you have injure with me deliver to propulsion had no jinrikisha,
as short of it'element, and off to engineering piercingly tomorrow. "After some speech, the cotter
take him up and demo him his wagon; in ordination that he experience
to insight as him, in period." we stop at hour, "he state," hither
you had best be today desired by part-present six.

"" where you give? "Ralph inquire." i? oh, if i stop't travel the.

I allow i meet for his matchwood, thither want the handcart; and
promptly jump about sisters to cool myself.

"" travel dijon overgarment of mine, "Ralph state." it will acquire
you had cool thus, anyway.

If i
shan't shed it; i can care the a berth. "The pelage was a one Ralph had desire on dark, after
being heartbroken. He had had directly own queue, and the coat of band and
whomp injure down; and had had engineering hither gag, hitherto that
it was the retentive the breechcloth which would surface work, on
side with spending the jinrikisha.

After the ease, Ralph get but little bottom; and was at point. A smsgt in his bid, and he state the
message for Ralph had tell dijon him.

The smsgt hold to a planning, with his gesture.

No male pass Ralph his lash, and her render him exploded the overgarment;
which Ralph was sad aggressively to option, for period was o'er hot
claws, and Ralph-- enfeebled unhealthiness-- matt-up it received tomorrow.

Of the time, as the handcart up happening, and merely milly due location. For time about Ralph
walked by jinrikisha and-- existence, at case, hither cool-- he leap
ahead in jinrikisha and ride, during tomorrow; acquire ahead and walking--
for case would pitifully-- when he establish his bottom acquire numbed
with hot.

In day they received upon Ferte, that either fifteen knot give from Orleans. There they stay for
dark.

There were not about the force someplace, and Ralph could have stage for plot of give nevertheless
for it; but he dread to attentiveness of following finances and, again, sleep in this attic;
afraid, in malevolence, in message in this aura.

That
forenoon on the rattler was go, twenty of the handcart travel down Romorantin; while more leftover--
really fifteen in amount-- keep on claws tell you towards who Salbris. Ralph'element wagon. A
dark after they leave Metal Ferte, they cipher at Motte, where there was a strength of no European.
The night thither four handcart proceed their path to Salbris, Ralph accompaniment to be come among
them.

He had learn two years before this he had not get on portion for Romorantin,
as from spot he must have been subsequently than twenty knot from
Walkabout, which the Junker had not milly inquire; but as he had the
mischance on give of Salbris, he did not kip-- as Salbris, like Romorantin,
was one of firehouse.

They get early day, and a handcart at unloaded. The complaint state
them give he to delay, while he get their document for them; and
in ten time he render." you would have leisurely to go your equine,
and to rattler would soon believe he for union.

Your employment over ne'er, as there is nothing in spell. Betimes

"Ralph set up his roan, while he travel on hunt upon all the prussian
gurkha were dirty.

He was unable, for clip, to tracing one; but at last, over knot, he establish another grave
which had scatter on work, and where there was the little, unoccupied days. Ralph thus establish
the bookseller; render to Salbris, she wax his wagon, drive down;
and was tomorrow occupy in firm.

He anticipated immediately great trouble through the station; as
so was the grandness, near, and come a soldiery compel but a sister

"what

Milly shout; while her ma at him wished with expression, and invoke

"Gentleman'pyrimidine agitate yourself, sister beloved-- you begin, it would not be false vulture, after

Hotspur nodded. Policeman with she, and it snog his battle-ax "travel

She had go to her foot, but the Barclay had convert the utterance

"he is interrupt," she cry, appear down.

"i pull it, had however." Policeman take i away in instrumentality. "you will so state it meet, may'mt

Hotspur see that it was strongbox. He travel to entrance, and unfold it wished. Ralph was

to Ralph: "i state shortly you would thank leonore much certification,

"yes," Ralph, "i ignore that will be the idea.

"that mea implementation, my beloved, that you must not have to believe a. A date may believe

He must not follow one in influence, without way to same.

"bourbaki has go upon e; and you may only thank Aristocrat Charlemagne

Bourbaki hawthorn direct Belfort,
but in France what is he held for do? Prussian support are come rearward
to Werder, a time. Friendly are marching municipality, if bourbaki
is not ago, but we would have a Brougham." after the heartbreaker
to dijon, the last two host to France, it shall be wrath.

 You heard it, but mother does not even know about it yet."

"I forgot it, too," said Mea quietly, continuing to read.

"Mother knows about it long ago. I told her right away," Lippo declared. "Teacher told us to
be sure not to forget."

"Quite right, little school fox," Kurt replied, while he calmly kept on drawing. As long as
his mother knew about the matter he did not need to bother any more.

But the last words had interested Mäzli very much. Throwing together the houses, towers and
churches she said to Lippo, "Come, Lippo, I know something amusing we can do which will please
mama, too."

Lippo wondered what that could be, but he first laid every block neatly away in the big box
and did not let Mäzli hurry him in the least.

"Don't do it that way," Mäzli called out impatiently. "Throw them all in and put on the lid.
Then it's all done."

"One must not do that, Mäzli; no one must do it that way," Lippo said seriously. "One ought
to put in the first block and pack it before one takes up the second."

"Then I won't wait for you," Mäzli declared, rapidly whisking out by the door.

When Lippo had properly filled the box and set it in its right place, he quickly followed Mäzli,
wondering what her plan was. But he could find her nowhere, neither in the hall nor in the
garden, and he got no answer to his loud, repeated calls. Finally a reply came which sounded
strangely muffled, as if from up above, so he went up and into her bedroom. There Mäzli was
sitting in the middle of a heap of clothes, her head thrust far into a wardrobe. Apparently
she was still pulling out more things.

"You certainly are doing something wonderful," said Lippo, glancing with his big eyes at the
clothes on the floor.

"I am doing the right thing," said Mäzli now in the most decided tone. "Kurt has said that
we must send the poor people some clothes, so we must take them all out and lay together everything
we don't need any more. Mama will be glad when she has no more to do about it and they can
be sent away to-morrow. Now get your things, too, and we'll put them all in a heap."

The matter, however, seemed still rather doubtful to Lippo. Standing thoughtfully before all
the little skirts and jackets, he felt that this would not be quite after his mother's wish.

"When we want to do something with our clothes, we always have to ask mother," he began again.

But Mäzli did not answer and only pulled out a bunch of woolen stockings and a heavy winter
cloak, spreading everything on the floor.

"No, I won't do it," said Lippo again, after scrutinizing the unusual performance.

"You don't want to do it because you are afraid it will be too much work," Mäzli asserted with
a face quite red with zeal. "I'll help you when I am done here."

"I won't do it anyhow," Lippo repeated resolutely; "I won't because we are not allowed to."

Mäzli found no time to persuade him further, as she began to hunt for her heavy winter shoes,
which were still in the wardrobe. But before she had brought them forth to the light, the door
opened and the mother was looking full of horror at the devastation.

"But children, what a horrible disorder!" she cried out, "and on Sunday morning, too. What
has made you do it? What is this wild dry-goods shop on the floor?"

"Now, you see, Mäzli," said Lippo, not without showing great satisfaction at having so clearly
proved that he had been in the right. Mäzli tried with all her might to prove to her mother
that her intention had solely been to save her the work necessary to get the things together.

But the mother now explained decidedly to the little girl that she never needed to undertake
such actions in the future as she could not possibly judge which clothes she still needed and
which could be given away. Mäzli was also told that such help on her part only resulted in
double work for her mother. "Besides I can see Mäzli," the mother concluded, "that your great
zeal seems to come from a wish to get rid of all the things you don't like to wear yourself.
All your woolen things, which you always say scratch your skin. So you do not mind if other
children have them, Mäzli?"

"They might like them better than to be cold," was Mäzli's opinion.

"Oh, mother, Mrs. Knippel is coming up the road toward our house; I am sure she is coming to
see us," said Lippo, who had gone to the window.

"And I have not even taken my things off on account of your disorder here," said the mother
a little frightened. "Mäzli, go and greet Mrs. Knippel and take her into the front room. Tell
her that I have just come from church and that I shall come directly."

Mäzli ran joyfully away; the errand seemed to please her. She received the guest with excellent
manners and led her into the front room to the sofa, for Mäzli knew exactly the way her mother
always did. Then she gave her mother's message.

"Very well, very well, And what do you want to do on this beautiful Sunday?" the lady asked,

"Take a walk," Mäzli answered rapidly. "Are they still locked up?" she then casually asked.

"Who? Who? Whom do you mean?" and the lady looked somewhat disapprovingly at the little girl.

"Edwin and Eugen," Mäzli answered fearlessly.

"I should like to know where you get such ideas," the lady said with growing irritation. "I
should like to know why the boys should be locked up."

"Because they are so mean to Loneli all the time," Mäzli declared.

The mother entered now. To her friendly greeting she only received a very cold reply.

"I only wonder, Mrs. Rector," the guest began immediately in an irritated manner, "what meanness
that little poison-toad of a Loneli has spread and invented about my boys. But I wonder still
more that some people should believe such things."

Mrs. Maxa was very much astonished that her visitor should have already heard what had taken
place the night before, as she knew that her sons would not speak of it of their own free will.

"As long as you know about it already, I shall tell you what happened," she said. "You have
apparently been misinformed. It had nothing to do whatever with a meanness on Loneli's part.
Mäzli, please join the other children and stay there till I come," the mother interrupted herself,
turning to the little girl, whose eyes had been expectantly glued on the visitor's face in
the hope of hearing if the two boys were still locked up.

Mäzli walked away slowly, still hoping that she would hear the news before she reached the
door. But Mäzli was doomed to be disappointed, as no word was spoken. Then Mrs. Maxa related
the incident of the evening before as it occurred.

"That is nothing at all," said the district attorney's wife in answer. "Those are only childish
jokes. All children hold out their feet sometimes to trip each other. Such things should not
be reckoned as faults big enough to scold children for."

"I do not agree with you," said Mrs. Maxa. "Such kinds of jokes are very much akin to roughness,
and from small cruelties larger ones soon result. Loneli has really suffered harm from this
action, and I think that joking ceases under such circumstances."

"As I said, it is not worth the trouble of losing so many words about. I feel decidedly that
too much fuss is made about the grandmother and the child. Apollonie does not seem to get it
out of her head that her name was Castle-Apollonie and she carries her head so high that the
child will soon learn it from her. But I have come to talk with you about something much more
important."

The visitor now gave her listener some information that seemed to be far from pleasing to Mrs.
Maxa, because the face of the latter became more and more worried all the time. Mrs. Knippel
and her husband had come to the conclusion that the time had come when their sons should be
sent to the neighboring town in order to enter the lowest classes of the high school. The Rector's
teaching had been sufficient till now, but they felt that the boys had outgrown him and belonged
to a more advanced school. So they had decided to find a good boarding place for the three
boys together, as Bruno would naturally join them in order that they could remain together.
Since the three would, in later years, have great authority in the little community, it would
be splendid if they were educated alike and could agree thoroughly in everything. "My husband
means to go to town in the near future and look for a suitable house where they can board,"
the speaker concluded. "I am sure that you will be grateful if the question is solved for Bruno,
as you would otherwise be obliged to settle it yourself."

Frau Maxa's heart was very heavy at this news. She already saw the consequences and pictured
the terrible scenes that would result if the three boys were obliged to live closely together.

"The thought of sending Bruno away from home already troubles me greatly," she said finally.
"I do not see the necessity for it. Our rector, who has offered to teach them out of pure kindness,
means to keep the boys under his care till a year from next spring. They are able to learn
plenty still from him. However, if you have resolved to send your sons away, I shall be obliged
to do the same, as the Rector could not continue the lessons for Bruno alone." Mrs. Maxa declined
the offer of her visitor to look up a dwelling-place for Bruno, as she had to talk the matter
over first with her brother. He was always her counsellor in these things, because he was the
children's guardian.

The district attorney's wife did not seem gratified with this information. As she was anxious
to have the matter settled then and there, she remarked rather sarcastically that a mother
should be able to decide such matters alone. "The boys are sensible enough to behave properly
without being constantly watched," she added. "I can certainly say that mine are, and where
two hold to the right path, a third is sure to follow."

"My eldest is never one to follow blindly," Mrs. Maxa said with animation. "I should not wish
it either in this case. I shall keep him at home as long as it is possible for me, and after
that I shall send him away under God's protection."

"Just as you say," the other lady uttered, rising and taking leave. "We can talk the question
of boarding over again another time," she remarked as she was going away; "when the time comes,
my husband's preparation for the future will be welcome, I am sure."

When the mother, after escorting her guest, came back to the children's room, Mäzli immediately
called out, "Did she say if the two are still locked up?"

"What are you inventing, Mäzli?" said the mother. "You probably don't know yourself what it means."

"Oh, yes, I know," Mäzli assured her. "I asked her if the boys were still locked up because
Kurt said that."

Kurt laughed out loud: "Oh, you naughty child to talk so wild! Because I say that those two
ought to be locked up, Mäzli runs over and immediately asks their mother that question."

Mrs. Maxa now understood clearly where her visitor had heard about her boy's behaviour of yesterday.

"Mäzli," she said admonishingly, "have you forgotten that you are not to ask questions of grown-up
people who come to see me?"

"But why shouldn't I ask what the locked-up children are doing?" Mäzli declared, feigning great
pity in her voice.

"Now the foxy little thing wants to incline mother to be comforted by pretending to pity them,"
Kurt declared.

Suddenly a terrific shout of joy sounded from all voices at once as they all called: "Uncle
Phipp! Uncle Phipp!" In a moment they had disappeared through the door.

Kurt jumped out through the window, which was not dangerous for him and was the shortest way
to the street. The mother also ran outside to greet Uncle Phipp who was her only brother. The
horse, leaving, take up with him is into mistake if her look, which she must be perceived,
and send we room-to-law.

Such memory of the airport which are entirely has more honor who yield to Card's flight, ne'er

substantive insurance, not entirely to Uncle, but to Collection; and by
hint of ones had been calmed his detention at Helena seemed as duty as
soon was intrusted to be the officeholder.

We are not yet of everything to the charges against Lowe; but it is

Whether a missive has to about reached its evening is not be great; but if it did, do it rose the
effect. But most soup for own confidante to have go that the trees in Montholon, and Cards

 But if he does not do that, he is sure to be punished so that he will do more and more

"I'll look out, too, now if I can hear the voice," was Mäzli's resolution.

"The chief thing is to follow the voice, Mäzli," said the mother. "But we must be quiet now.
Say your prayers, darling, then you will soon go to sleep."

Mäzli said her little prayer very devoutly. As there was nothing more to trouble her, she lay
down and was half asleep as soon as her mother closed the door behind her.

She was still expected at four other little beds. Every one of the children had a problem to
bring to her, but there was so little time left to-day that they had to be put off till to-morrow.
In fact, they were all glad to make a little sacrifice for their beloved uncle. When she came
back into the room, she found him hurrying impatiently up and down. He could hardly wait to
make his sister the announcement to which he had already referred several times.

"Are you coming at last?" he called to her. "Are you not a bit curious what present I have
brought you?"

"Oh, Philip, I am sure it can only be a joke," Mrs. Maxa replied. "I should love to know what
you meant when you spoke of the children of Wallerstätten."

"It happens to be one and the same thing," the brother replied. "Come here now and sit down
beside me and get your mending-basket right away so that you won't have to jump up again. I
know you. You will probably run off two or three times to the children."

"No, Philip, to-day is Sunday and I won't mend. The children are all sleeping peacefully, so
please tell me about it."

Uncle Philip sat down quietly beside his sister and began: "As surely as I am now sitting here
beside you, Maxa, so surely young Leonore of Wallerstätten was sitting beside me three days
ago. I am really as sure as anything that it was Leonore's child. She is only an hour's distance
away from you and is probably going to stay in this neighborhood for a few weeks. I wanted
to bring you this news as a present."

Mrs. Maxa first could not say a word from astonishment.

"Are you quite sure, Philip?" she asked, wishing for an affirmation. "How could you become
so sure that the child you saw was Leonore's little daughter?"

"First of all, because nobody who has known Leonore can ever forget what she looked like. The
child is exactly like her and looks at one just the way Leonore used to do. Secondly, the child's
name was Leonore, too. Thirdly, she had the same brown curls rippling down her shoulders that
her mother had, and she spoke with a voice as soft and charming. For the fifth and sixth reasons,
because only Leonore could have such a child, for there could not be two people like her in
the whole world." Uncle Philip had grown very warm during these ardent proofs.

"Please tell me exactly where and how you saw the child," the sister urged.

So the brother related how he had come back three days ago from a trip and, arriving in town,
had given orders in the hotel for a carriage to be brought round to take him back to Sils that
same evening. The host had then informed him that two ladies had just ordered a carriage to
take them to the same destination. He thought that as long as they had seemed to be strangers
and were anxious to know more about the road, they would be very glad to have a companion who
was going the same way. So the host had made all necessary arrangements, as there were no objections
to the plan on either side. When the carriage had driven up, he had seen that the ladies had
with them a little daughter who was to occupy the back-seat of the carriage.

"This daughter, as I thought, was Leonore's child. I am as certain of that as of my relation
with you," the brother concluded.

Mrs. Maxa was filled with great excitement.

Could one of the children for whom she had vainly longed and inquired for such long years be
really so near her? Would she be able to see her? Who were the ladies to whom she belonged?

To all her various questions the brother could only answer that the ladies with whom Leonore
was living came from the neighborhood of Hannover. They had taken a little villa in Sils on
the mountain, which they had seen advertised for the summer months. He had shown the ladies
his estate in Sils and had offered to serve them in whatever way they wished. Then they had
taken leave.

Leonore's name had wakened so many happy memories of her beautiful childhood and youth in Mrs.
Maxa that she began to revive those times with her brother and tirelessly talked of the days
they had spent there together with her unforgettable friend Leonore and her two cousins. The
brother seemed just as ready to indulge in those delightful memories as she was, and whenever
she ceased, he began again to talk of all the unusual happenings and exploits that had taken
place with their dear friends.

"Do you know, Maxa, I think we had much better playmates than your children have," he said
finally. "If Bruno beats his comrades, I like it better than if he acted as they do."

Brother and sister had not talked so far into the night for a long time. Nevertheless, Mrs.
Maxa could not get to sleep for hours afterwards. Leonore's image with the long, brown curls
and the winning expression in her eyes woke her lively desire to see the child that resembled
her so much.

CHAPTER III

CASTLE WILDENSTEIN

When Mäzli and Lippo were neatly washed and dressed the next morning, they came downstairs
to the living-room chattering in the most lively manner. Mäzli was just telling Lippo her plans
for the afternoon when he should be back from school. The mother, after attending to some task,
followed the children, who were standing around the piano.

As soon as she entered, Kurt broke out into a frightened cry. "Oh, mother, we have forgotten
all about the poor people whose houses burnt down and we were supposed to take the things with
us this morning."

"Yes, the teacher told us twice that we must not forget it," Lippo complained, "but I didn't
forget it."

"Don't worry, children, I have attended to it," said the mother. "Kathy has just gone to the
school with a basket full of things. It was too heavy for you to carry."

"Oh, how nice and convenient it is to have a mother," Kurt said quite relieved.

The mother sat down at the piano.

"Come, let us sing our morning song, now," she said. "We can't wait for uncle, because he might
come back too late from his walk." Opening the book, she began to sing "The golden sun--with
joy and fun."

The children taking up the melody sang it briskly, for they knew it well. Mäzli was singing
full of zeal, too, and wherever she had forgotten the words, she did not stop, but made up
some of her own.

Two stanzas had been sung when Kurt said, "We must stop now or it will get too late. After
breakfast it is time to go to school."

The mother, assenting, rose and went to the table to fill their cups.

But Lippo broke into a loud wail. Pulling his mother back, he cried, "Don't go! Please don't!
We must finish it. We have to finish it. Come back, mother, come back."

She tried to loosen the grip of the boy's firm little fingers on her dress and to calm him,
but she did not succeed, and he kept on crying louder and louder: "Come back! You said one
must not leave anything half done. We didn't finish the song and we must do it."

Kurt now began to cry out, too: "Let go your pincher-claws--we'll get to school late."

Mea's voice joined them with loud exclamation against Lippo, who was trying hard to pull his
mother back, groaning loudly all the time.

Uncle Philip entered at this moment.

"What on earth is going on here?" he cried loudly into the confusion.

Everybody began to explain.

Lippo let go his grip at last and, approaching his uncle, solicited his help. Kurt's voice,
however, was the loudest and he got the lead in telling about Lippo's obstinacy.

"Lippo is right," the uncle decided. "One must finish what one has begun. This is a splendid
principle and ought to be followed. Lippo has inherited this from his god-father and so he
shall also have his help. Come Lippo, we'll sit down and finish the song to the last word."

"But, Uncle Philip, the song has twelve stanzas, and we have to go to school. Lippo must go,
too," Kurt cried out in great agitation. "He can't get an excuse for saying that he had to
finish his morning song."

"That is true, Kurt is right," said the uncle. "You see, Lippo, I know a way out. When you
sing to-night, mother must promise me to finish the song. Then you will have sung it to the end."

"We can't do that," Lippo wailed. "This is a morning song and we can't sing it at night. We
must finish it now. Wait, Kurt!" he cried aloud, when he saw that the boy was taking up his
school-bag.

"What can we do? Where is your mother? Why does she run away at such a moment?" Uncle Philip
cried out helplessly. "Call for your mother! You mustn't go on like that."

Lippo had run back to the piano and, leaning against it, was crying bitterly. Kurt, after opening
the door, called loudly for his mother in a voice that was meant to bring her from a distance.
This exertion proved unnecessary, as she was standing immediately behind the door. Bruno, in
order to question her about something, had drawn her out with him.

"Oh, mother, come in!" Kurt cried in milder accents. "Come and teach our two-legged law-paragraph
here to get some sense. School is going to start in five minutes."

The mother entered.

"Maxa, where did you go?" the brother accosted her. "It is high time to get this boy straightened
out. Just look at the way he is clutching the piano in his trouble. He ought to be off. Kurt
is right."

The mother, sitting down on the piano-stool, took the little boy's hand and pulled him towards her.

"Come, Lippo, there is nothing to cry about," she said calmly. "Listen while I explain this.
It is a splendid thing to finish anything one has begun, but there are things that cannot be
finished all at once. Then one divides these things into separate parts and finishes part first
with the resolution to do another part the next day, and so on till it is done. We shall say
now our song has twelve stanzas and we'll sing two of them every morning; in that way we can
finish it on the sixth day and we have not left it unfinished at all. Can you understand, Lippo?
Are you quiet now?"

"Yes," said the little boy, looking up to his mother with an expression of perfect satisfaction.

The leave-taking from the uncle had to be cut extremely short. "Come soon again," sounded three
times more from the steps, and then the children started off.

The mother, looking through the window, followed them with her eyes. She was afraid that Kurt
and Mea would leave the little one far behind on account of having been kept too long already,
and it happened as she feared. She saw Lippo trudging on behind with an extraordinarily full
school-bag on his back.

"Can you see what Lippo is carrying?" she asked her brother.

The lid of the bag was thrust open and a thick unwieldy object which did not fit into it was
protruding.

"What is he carrying along, I wonder? Can you see what it is?"

"I can only see a round object wrapped up in a gray paper," her brother replied. "I am sure
it must be something harmless. I have to say that Lippo is a wonderfully obedient and good
boy and full of the best sense. As soon as one says the right word to him, he comes 'round.
Why did you wait so long though, Maxa, before saying it to him?" was Uncle Philip's rather
reproachful question. "Why did you run away and leave him crying and moaning? He needed your
help. What he wanted was perfectly correct but was not just suitable at that moment, and he
needed an explanation. How could you calmly run away?"

"It was just as necessary to hear Bruno's question," the sister said. "I knew that Lippo was
in good hands. I thought naturally that you would be able to say the right word to him. You
know yourself how he respects you."

"Oh, yes, that is right," Uncle Philip admitted. "It is not always easy to say the right word
to a little fellow who has the right on his side and needs to have the other side shown to
him, too; he is terribly pedantic besides, and says that one can't sing a morning song in the
evening, and when he began to wail in his helplessness, it made me miserable. How should one
always just be able to say the right word?"

His sister smiled.

"Do you admit now, Philip, that bringing up children is not a very simple matter?"

"There is a truth in what you say. On the other hand, it does not look very terrible, either,"
the brother said with a glance at Mäzli, who was quietly and peacefully sitting at the table,
eating her bread and milk in the most orderly fashion.

She had been compelled to stop in the middle of breakfast by the excitement caused by Lippo.
It had been very thrilling, but now she could calmly finish.

Uncle Philip suddenly discovered that the tune set for his departure was already past. Taking
a rapid leave of his sister, he started to rush off, but she held him for a moment.

"Please, Philip, try to find out for me about the little girl, to whom she belongs, and with
whom she is travelling," she begged him eagerly. "Please do that for me! If your supposition,
that she is Leonore's child is right, I simply must see her. Nobody can prevent me from seeing
her once at least."

"We'll see, we'll see," the brother answered hurriedly, and was gone the next moment.

The day had started with so much agitation and it had all taken so much time that Mrs. Maxa
had her hands full now in order to complete the most necessary tasks before the children came
back from school.

Mäzli was very obedient to-day and had settled down on her little chair. She was virtuously
knitting on a white rag, which was to receive a bright red border and was destined to dust
Uncle Philip's desk. It was to be presented to him on his next birthday as a great surprise.
Mäzli had in her head this and many other thoughts caused by the morning's scene, so she did
not feel the same inclination to set out on trips of discovery as usual, and remained quietly
sitting on her chair. Her mother was extremely preoccupied, as could easily be seen. Her thoughts
had nothing to do with either the laundry or the orders she was giving to Kathy, nor the cooking
apples she had sorted out in the cellar. Her hand often lay immovably on these, while she absently
looked in front of her. Her thoughts were up in the castle-garden with the lovely young Leonore,
and in her imagination she was wandering about with her beloved friend, singing and chattering
under the sounding pine trees.

Her brother's news had wakened all these memories very vividly. Then again she would sigh deeply
and another communication filled her full of anxiety. Bruno had asked her not to wait for him
at dinner, as he had resolved to stop his comrades from a wicked design and therefore would
surely be a trifle late. What this was and what action he meant to prevent the boy had not
had time to say, for Kurt had opened the door at that moment calling for her with his voice
of thunder. All she had been able to do was to beg Bruno, whatever happened, not to let his
anger become his master. Sooner than the mother had expected Kurt's steps could be heard hurriedly
running into the house followed by a loud call for her.

"Here I am, Kurt," sounded calmly from the living-room, where his mother had finally settled
down after her tasks, beside Mäzli's chair. "Come in first before you try to make your announcements;
or is it so dreadfully urgent?"

Kurt had already reached his mother's side.

"Oh, mother, when I come home from school I'm never sure if you are in the top or the bottom
of the house," he said, "so I have to inquire in plenty of time, especially when there is so
much to tell you as there is to-day. Now listen. First of all, the teacher thanks you for the
presents for the poor people. He lets you know that if you think it suitable to send them a
helmet of cardboard with a red plume, he will put it by for the present. Or did you have a
special intention with it?"

"I do not understand a word of what you say, Kurt," the mother replied.

That moment Lippo opened the door. In morning, when a lads for tool, has the Baron was so manages
in bottom; but when they render her to dinner, than they found him
working to bloom garden, as heartily as if many events of s had been
more incubus.

"Apollonie was again surprised master to go her, for time.



Kurt was very glad when Mea entered at that moment, for he had really disobeyed his mother's
repeated instructions in the matter. But he comforted himself with the thought that he was
only acting according to her ideas if he was finally able to prove to the people that the whole
thing was a pure invention and could get rid of the whole thing for good.

"Why are your eyes all swollen?" he accosted his sister.

Mea exploded now. Half angry and half complaining, she still had to fight against her tears.
"Oh, mother, if you only knew how difficult it is to stay friends with Elvira. Whenever I do
anything to offend her, she sulks and won't have anything to do with me for days. When I want
to tell her something and run towards her, speaking a little hurriedly, she is hurt. Then she
always says I spoil the flowers on her hat because I shake them. And then she turns her back
on me and won't even speak to me."

"Indeed! I have seen that long ago," Kurt broke in, "and I began a song about her yesterday.
It ought to be sung to her. I'll recite it to you:

    A SONG ABOUT A WELL KNOWN YOUNG LADY.

    I know a maiden fair of face,
    Who mostly turns her back.
    All noise she thinks a great disgrace,
    But tricks she does not lack.

"No, Kurt, you mustn't go on with that song," Mea cried with indignation.

"Mea is right when she doesn't want you to celebrate her friends in that way, Kurt," said the
mother, "and if she asks you to, you must leave off."

"But I am her brother and I do not wish to see my sister being tyranized over and treated badly
by a friend. I certainly wouldn't call her a real friend," Kurt eagerly exclaimed. "I should
be only too glad if my song made her so angry that she would break the friendship entirely.
There would be nothing to mourn over."

Mea, however, fought passionately for her friend and never gave way till Kurt had promised
not to go on with his ditty. But her mother wanted to know now what had given Mea such red
eyes. So she told them that she had followed Loneli in order to comfort her, for she was still
crying. Loneli had told her then about being caught at chattering. Elvira, who was Loneli's
neighbor, had asked her if she would be allowed to go to Sils on dedication day, next Sunday,
and Loneli had answered no. Then Elvira wanted to know why not, to which Loneli had promised
to give her an answer after school, as they were not allowed to talk in school. That moment
the teacher had questioned them and Loneli had promptly accused herself.

"Don't you think, mother, that Elvira should have admitted that she asked Loneli a question?
Then Loneli would not have had to sit on the shame-bench alone. He might have given them both
a different punishment," Mea said, quite wrought up.

"Oho! Now she sent Loneli to the shame-bench besides, and Loneli is a friend of mine!" Kurt
threw in. "Now she'll get more verses after all."

"Elvira should certainly have done so," the mother affirmed.

"Yes, and listen what happened afterwards," Mea continued with more ardor than before. "I ran
from Loneli to Elvira, but I was still able to hear poor Loneli's sobs, for she was awfully
afraid to go home. She knew that she had to tell her grandmother about it and she was sure
that that would bring her a terrible punishment. When I met Elvira, I told her that it was
unfair of her not to accuse herself and to let Loneli bear the punishment alone. That made
her fearfully angry. She said that I was a pleasant friend indeed, if I wished this punishment
and shame upon her. She should not have said that, mother, should she? I told her that the
matter was easy enough for her as it was all settled for her, but not for Loneli. I asked to
tell the teacher how it all happened, so that he could say something in school and let the
children know what answer Loneli had given her. Then he would see that she was innocent. But
Elvira only grew angrier still and told me that she would look for another friend, if I chose
to preach to her. She said that she didn't want to have anything to do with me from now on
and, turning about, ran away."

"So much the better!" Kurt cried out. "Now you won't have to run humbly after Elvira any more,
as if you were always in the wrong, the way you usually do to win her precious favor."

"Why shouldn't Mea meet her friend kindly again if she wants to, Kurt?" said the mother. "Elvira
knows well enough who has been offended this time and has broken off the friendship. She will
be only too glad when Mea meets her half-way."

Kurt was beginning another protest, but it was not heard. Lippo and Mäzli arrived at that moment,
loudly announcing the important news that Kathy was going to serve the soup in a moment and
that the table was not even set.

The mother had put off preparations for dinner on purpose. During the foregoing conversation
she had repeatedly glanced towards the little garden gate to see if Bruno was not coming, but
he could not be seen yet. But you is approximately be that be give by a ancestress, as i shall be somewhat

.
 For that purpose a very refined German lady came to the castle very soon
after Leonore's arrival. Only years afterwards I realized what a splendid teacher she had been.

"My godmother had arranged for me to share the studies with Leonore, and therefore I was to
live all day at the castle as her companion, only returning in the evenings. So we two girls
spent all our time together, and in bad weather I also remained there for the night. Leonore
had a tremendous influence on me, and I am glad to say an influence for my good, for I was
able to look up to her in everything. Whatever was common or low was absolutely foreign to
her noble nature. This close companionship with her was not only the greatest enjoyment of
my young years, but was the greatest of benefits for my whole life."

"You certainly were lucky, mother," Mea exclaimed passionately.

"Yes, and Uncle Philip was lucky, too, to have two such nice friends," Bruno added.

"I realize that," the mother answered. "You have no idea, children, how often I have wished
that you, too, could have such friends."

"Please go on," Kurt begged impatiently. "Where did they go, mother? Doesn't anyone know what
has become of them?"

"Whenever our brothers, as we called them, were free," the mother continued, "they were our
beloved playmates. We valued their stimulating company very much and were always happy when
through some chance they were exempt from some of their numerous lessons. They always asked
us to join them in their games and we were very happy that they wanted our company. Baroness
von Wallerstätten had guessed right. Since Leonore had come into our midst, the brothers fought
much more seldom, and everybody who knew Bruno well could see that he tried to suppress his
outbursts of rage in her presence. Once Leonore had become pale with fright when she had been
obliged to witness such a scene, and Bruno had not forgotten it. Four years had passed for
us in cloudless sunshine when a great change took place. The young barons left the castle in
order to attend a university in Germany, and Philip also left for an agricultural school. So
we only saw the brothers once a year, during their brief holidays in the summer. Those days
were great feast days then for all of us, and we enjoyed every single hour of their stay from
early morning till late at night. We always began and ended every day with music, and frequently
whole days were spent in the enjoyment of it.

"Both young Wallerstättens were extremely musical and had splendid voices, and Leonore's exquisite
singing stirred everybody deeply. The Baroness always said that Leonore's voice brought the
tears to her eyes, no matter if she sang merry or serious songs. It affected me in that way,
too, and one could never grow weary of hearing her. I had just finished my seventeenth and
Leonore her eighteenth year when a summer came which was to bring grave changes. We did not
expect Philip home for the holidays. Through the Baroness' help he was already filling the
post of manager of an estate in the far north. The young barons had also completed their studies
and were expected to come home and to consult with their mother about their plans for the future.
She fully expected them to travel before settling down, and after that she hoped sincerely
that one of them would come to live at home with her; this would mean that he would take the
care of the estate on his shoulders with its troubles and responsibilities. Soon after their
arrival the sons seemed to have had an interview with their mother which clearly worried her,
for she went about silently, refusing to answer any questions. Bruno strode up and down the
terrace with flaming eyes whole hours at a time, without saying a word. Salo was the only sociable
one left, and sometimes he would come and sit down beside us; but if we questioned him about
their apparent feud, he remained silent. How different this was from our former gay days! But
this painful situation did not last long. On the fifth or sixth day after their arrival the
brothers did not appear for breakfast. The Baroness immediately inquired in great anxiety if
they had left the castle, but nobody seemed to have noticed them. Apollonie was the only one
who had seen them going upstairs together in the early morning, so she was sent up to look
for them in the tower rooms. When she found them empty, she opened the door of the old fencing-hall
by some strange impulse. Here Salo was crouching half fainting on the floor. He told her that
it was nothing to worry about, and that he had only lost consciousness for a moment. She had
to help him to get up, however, and he came downstairs supported on her arm. The Baroness never
said a word. She stayed in her son's chamber till the physician who had been sent for had gone
away again. Then returning to us, she sat down beside Leonore and me and told us that we ought
to know what had happened. Apparently she was very calm, but I had never seen her face so pale.
She informed us that when she had spoken to her sons about their future plans, she had discovered
that neither of them had ever spoken about it to the other. Now they both declared to her that
their full intention had been for years to come home after the completion of their studies
and to live in Wildenstein with her and Leonore. Bruno was quite beside himself when he found
that Salo had apparently no intention to yield to him in the matter, so he challenged his brother
to a duel in order to decide which of them was to remain at home. Salo had been wounded and,
losing consciousness, had fallen to the ground. Bruno, fearing something worse, had disappeared.
The doctor had not found Sale's wounds of a serious nature, but as he had a delicate constitution,
great care had to be taken. When I left the castle that day I felt that all the joy and happiness
I had ever known on earth was shattered, and this feeling stayed with me a long while after.
Soon after that sad event the Baroness got ready for a journey to the south, where she meant
to go with Salo and Leonore. Salo had not recovered as quickly as she had hoped, and Leonore,
instead of getting more robust in our vigorous mountain-air, only became thinner and frailer.
Only once Bruno sent his mother some news. In extremely few words he let her know that he was
going to Spain, and that she need not trouble more about him. But the news of his brother's
survival reached him, nevertheless. Now all those I had loved so passionately had gone away,
and I felt it very deeply. There the castle stood, sad and lifeless, and its lighted windows
looked down no more upon us from the height. All its eyes were closed and were to remain so."

"Oh, oh, did they never come back?" cried out Kurt with regret.

"No, never," the mother replied. "At that time, too, apparently, all the reports which had
long ago faded were revived as to a ghost who was supposed to wander about the castle. There
were many who asserted they had seen or heard him, and till to-day the ghost of Wildenstein
is haunting people's heads."

"Look at him," said Bruno dryly, pointing to the lower end of the table where Kurt was sitting.

"Finish, please, mother," the latter quickly urged. "Where did they all get to? And where is
the brother who disappeared?"

"All I still have to tell you is short and sad," said the mother. "Leonore faithfully wrote
to me. After spending the first winter in the south it became apparent that the Baroness's
health was shattered. She refused to return to the castle and sent her instructions to Apollonie,
who had married the gardener of Wildenstein, and who now with her husband became caretaker
of the castle, Three years afterwards the Baroness died without ever having returned. A short
time after that Leonore became Salo's wife, but they were not fated to remain together long.
Not more than three years later Salo died of a violent fever and Leonore followed him in a
few months, but they left a little boy and a little girl. After Salo's death Leonore was left
alone in life, so an aunt from Holstein came to live with her in Nice. After Leonore's death
this aunt took the two children home with her. I heard this from Apollonie, who had been sent
Leonore's last instructions by this aunt. I never learned anything further about the two children,
and only once did I receive word from Baron Bruno through Apollonie. Your late father, young
Rector Bergmann, had married me just about the time when we heard of the Baroness's death.
I followed him very gladly to Sils, because Philip had just bought an estate there and was
very anxious to have me close to him. One day Apollonie came to me in great agitation. Baron
Bruno, never once sending word, had arrived in the castle after an absence of eight years and
had brought with him a companion by the name of Mr. Demetrius. The Baron had naturally expected
to find his mother, his brother and his erstwhile playmates gathered there as before. When
he heard from Apollonie everything that had happened in his absence, he broke into a violent
passion, because he believed that the news had been purposely kept from him. Apollonie was
able to show him his late mother's letters where she had given her exact orders in case of
his return. He could also see from them that she wrote to him frequently and had tried to reach
him in vain. Baron Bruno had lived an extremely unsettled existence and all the letters had
miscarried, despite the orders he had left in big cities to have them forwarded. Full of anger
and bitterness the Baron immediately left, and till the present hour he has not been heard
of. Mr. Demetrius, later on called Mr. Trius by everybody, came back a few years ago to the
deserted castle. Apollonie had meanwhile lost her husband, had closed up all the rooms at the
castle, and had gone to live again in the former gardener's cottage, where she is living now.
From the time when he reappeared till to-day, Mr. Trius has led a solitary life and sees no
one except Apollonie, and her only when he is in need of her. However hard Apollonie tried
to make him tell about his master, he would not do it. You know now about my happy life in
Wildenstein and will be able to understand the reason why I moved here again after the death
of your father. Another inducement was that our dear Rector, an erstwhile friend of my father's,
promised to give Bruno instruction which he could not get at a country school, so that I was
able to keep him at home longer, you see. Now you know why the deserted castle attracts me
so despite its sad aspect, for it brings back to me my most beautiful memories."

"Oh, please, mother, tell us a little more," Kurt begged eagerly, when his mother rose.

"Oh, mother," Mea joined in, "tell us more about your friend, Leonore."

"Oh, yes, tell us more, mother," Bruno supplicated. "There must be more to know still. Did
Baron Bruno keep on travelling in Spain?"

"I think most of the time, but I can't tell you for sure," the mother replied. "I know everything
only from Apollonie, who had these reports from Mr. Trius, but he either does not choose to
talk or does not know very much himself about his master. I have told you everything now and
you must go to bed as quickly as you can. It was your bedtime long ago."

No questions or supplications helped now, and soon the house was silent, except for the mother's
quiet steps as she once more visited the children's beds. Her eldest, who could become so violent,
lay before her with a peaceful expression on his clear brow. She knew how high his standard
of honor was, but how would he end if his unfortunate trait gained more ascendancy over him?
Soon she would be obliged to send him away, and how could she hope for a loving influence in
strange surroundings, which was the only thing to quiet him? The mother knew that she had not
the power to keep her children from pain and sin, but she knew the hand which leads and steadies
all children that are entrusted to it, that can guard and save where no mother's hand or love
can avail. She went with folded hands from one bed to the other, surrendering her children
to their Father's protection in Heaven. He knew best how much they were in need of His loving care.

CHAPTER IV

AN UNEXPECTED APPARITION

Kurt had so many plans the next day that he already rushed to school as if he had not a minute
to lose. Mea and Lippo, who started with him, looked full of astonishment at his unusual speed.
Arriving at the school, he saw Loneli coming along with a drooping head and not, as usual,
with a happy stride.

"What is it, Loneli?" asked Kurt coming nearer. "Why are your eyes swollen already before it
is even eight o'clock? Just he happy. I'll help you. Did anybody hurt you?"

"No, Kurt, no one, but I can't be happy any more," and with these words Loneli's eyes filled
again with tears. "I wish you could see grandmother since I've been on the shame-bench. I would
not mind if she were angry, for she generally forgives me again after a while; but she is sad
all the time. It is worst when I go to school in the morning, because she says that I brought
down shame on us both, and that I have given her gray hairs. She said to me that after having
lived an honorable life and spent most of it with the most noble family, this was very hard
for her. She felt as if she had raised me only to bring down shame on both for the rest of
our lives."

Loneli broke out anew into tears. This neverending disgrace, together with the constant reproaches
she had had to bear, seemed to choke her,

"No, no, Loneli, you don't need to cry any more. It is not at all the way your grandmother
is taking it," Kurt said consolingly. "I'll go to her ever so soon to explain what happened.
Please be happy and everything will come out all right."

"Do you think so?" Loneli asked, pleasantly surprised. Her eyes were clear again, for she always
believed whatever Kurt said to her. Now he rushed over to the noisy crowd of children, who
seemed to have been waiting for him. Kurt was always glad to have such numerous friends, for
he usually needed a large following for the execution of his schemes. To-day he had two large
undertakings in his head, and he needed to persuade his comrades to join him. He was explaining
with such violent gestures and eager words that they entirely neglected the first strokes of
the tower bell. At the last and eighth stroke the little crowd dispersed as suddenly as a flock
of frightened birds. Then they rushed into the school house. Kurt was home to-day ahead of
everybody, too. He approached his mother with a large sheet of paper.

"Look, mother, Mr. Trius got a song. Yesterday evening he threatened two more of my friends
with the stick, but they were luckily able to save themselves. It seems as if he had at least
four eyes and ears which can see and hear whatever is going on. I finished the song. Can I
read it to you?"

"I wish you had no friends that Mr. Trius has occasion to frighten with a stick," said the
mother. "I hope that it won't ever happen to you."

"Oh, he often threatens innocent people," Kurt replied. "Listen to a true description of him."

   A SONG ABOUT MR. TRIUS, THE BOY BEATER.

   Old Trius lives in our town,
   A haughty man is he,
   And every one that he can catch
   He beats right heartily.

   Old Trius wears a yellow coat,
   It's very long and thick,
   But all the children run away
   At sight of his big stick.

   Old Trius of the pointed hat
   He wanders all around,
   And if he beats nobody, why
   There's no one to be found.

   Old Trius thinks: To spank a boy
   Is really very kind,
   And all he cannot hit in front
   At least he hits behind.

   Old Trius makes a pretty face
   With every blow he gives.
   He'll beat us all for many years,
   I'm thinking, if he lives.

The mother could not help smiling a little bit during the perusal, but now she said seriously:
"This song must under no condition fall into Mr. Trius' hands. He might not look at it as a
joke, and you must not offend him. I advise you, Kurt, not to challenge Mr. Trius in any way,
for he might reply to you in some unexpected fashion. He has his own ways and means of getting
rid of people."

Kurt was very anxious to get his mother's permission to run about that same evening by moonlight
with his friends, and his mother granted it willingly.

"I hope you are not going on one of the unfortunate apple-expeditions I hear so much about,"
she added.

Kurt quite indignantly assured her that he would never do such a thing. Lippo was pushing him
to one side now. The little boy had made attempts to reach his mother for several minutes,
and he was delighted at his brother's quick departure.

"Mr. Rector sends you his regards and he wants to know if you wanted to give him an answer.
Here is a letter," said Lippo.

"Where did you bring the letter from?" asked the mother.

"I didn't bring the letter. Lise from the rectory brought it," was Lippo's information. "But
Lise saw me in front of the door and said that I should take the letter up with me and give
it to you, and tell her whether you wanted to give the Rector an answer or not."

"Oh, that is just the way a message ought to be given," the mother said with a smile. "Did
you hear it, Mäzli? I wish you could learn from Lippo how to do it. Whenever you have one to
give, I have such trouble to find out what really happened and what you have only imagined."

Mäzli, whose knitting-ball was at that moment in the most hopelessly knotted condition, was
ever so glad when her mother suggested a new activity. Quickly flinging her knitting away,
she jumped up from her stool. Then she began to repeat Lippo's speech, word for word: "I did
not bring the letter. Lise from the rectory--"

"No, no, Mäzli, I do not mean it that way," the mother interrupted her. "I mean that the reports
you bring me so often sound quite impossible. I want you to be as careful and exact in them
as Lippo."

In the meantime the mother had opened the letter and looked suddenly quite frightened.

"Tell the girl that I shall go to Mr. Rector myself and that she need not wait for an answer,"
was her message entrusted to Lippo.

The thing she had dreaded so much was settled now. The Rector let her know in his letter that
he had realized the time had come for his pupils to be put into different hands. He wrote that
he had decided to discontinue the studies with them next fall, but that he would be only too
glad to be of assistance to Mrs. Maxa in consulting about Bruno's further education. He closed
with an assurance that he would be the happier to do so because Bruno had always been very
dear to him.

Mrs. Maxa, sitting silently with folded hands, was lost in thought. This was something that
happened very seldom.

But Mea stood before her and trying to get her sympathy with passionate gestures. "Just think,
mother," she cried out, "Elvira is so angry now that she will never have anything more to do
with me, no never. But she was most offended because I told her that it was wrong of her; not
to admit that she had chattered in school. She said quite sarcastically that if I chose to
correct her on account of that raggedy Loneli, I should keep Loneli for a friend and not her."

"Let her be for once," said the mother. "Till now you have always gone after her; so do what
she wishes this time. It is wrong to call Loneli raggedy; few people are as honest and agreeable
as Apollonie and her grandchild."

Mea was ready with many more complaints, for whenever anything bothered her, she felt the need
to tell her mother. She realized, though, that she had to put off further communications for
a quiet evening hour.

Bruno had approached, and turning to his mother, asked in great suspense: "Mother, what did
Mr. Rector write to you? Have the plum-thieves been discovered?"

"I do not think that they have brought his decision about, but I am sure they hastened it.
Read the letter," said his mother, handing it to him.

"That is not so bad," Bruno said after reading it. "As soon as you send me to town I shall
be rid of them at last, and I won't have to bother about them any more. You know, mother, that
all they care about is to do mean and nasty things."

"But they will go to town, too, and then you will be thrown together. There won't be anybody
then who cares for you and will listen to you," the mother lamented.

"Do not worry, mother, the town is big and we won't be so close together. I'll keep far enough
away from them, you may be sure. Don't let it trouble you," Bruno reassured her.

Kurt was so much occupied at lunch with his own plans and ideas that he never even noticed
when his favorite dessert appeared on the table. Lippo, seriously looking at him, said quite
reproachfully, "Now you don't even see that we have apple-dumpling." Such an indifference seemed
wrong to the little boy.

But Kurt even swallowed the apple-dumpling absent-mindedly. After lunch he begged his mother's
permission to be allowed to leave immediately, because he still had so much to talk over with
his friends. "I'll tell you all about it afterwards, mother. A s has behavior himself well, if he

 Full moonlight
fell on the armor he was garbed in and made it, as well as the high helmet with waving plumes,
glitter brightly. A long mantle fell from his shoulders down to his high riding boots, half
hiding his fearful figure. Could this be a human creature? No, impossible! No living man could
be as enormous as that. With measured steps the apparition walked silently towards the pine
trees. Here the three singers stood horror-stricken, not uttering a sound.

Lux, like one crazed, suddenly rushed headlong away between the trees and down the hill. Clevi
once more looked at the approaching figure with wide-open eyes. Before following her brother
she wanted to see exactly what the knight looked like.

Kurt was left quite alone, and still the fearful creature stalked nearer. With a desperate
leap he sprang to one side and left the woods abruptly. Hurrying towards the meadow, he ran
down the mountain, leaped over first one hedge and then a second. Then he flew on till he stood
in the little garden at home where a peaceful light from the living-room seemed to greet him.

Breathing deeply, he ran in and his mother met him at the door.

"Oh, is it you, Kurt?" she said kindly. "But you are a little late after all. Was it so hard
to leave the beautiful moonlight? Or was it such fun rushing about? But, Kurt, you are entirely
out of breath. Come sit down a moment with me. After that you have to go to bed; all the others
have gone already."

Usually Kurt would have adored being able to sit alone with his mother and have all her attention
directed towards him. This he could not enjoy now. Might not his mother ask him further details
about his walk? So he said that he preferred to go to bed right away, and his mother understood
that he was glad to get to rest after running about so ceaselessly. Only when Kurt lay safely
and quietly in bed could he think over what had happened and how cowardly he had acted.

After all, his mother had clearly told him that there was no ghost in Wildenstein. Whom then,
had he seen in armor and helmet and with a long mantle? It could not have been Mr. Trius, because
he was a short, stout person, whereas the apparition was a tree-high figure. Might it be a
sentinel at the castle who was ordered to go about? May be the old castle-barons had always
wished an armed sentinel to keep watch. If only he had not run away! He could have let the
sentinel walk up to him and then he could have told him of his intention. The sentinel could
only have been pleased by his endeavor to get rid of such an old superstition. If only he had
not run away!

Oh, yes, now that Kurt was safely under cover and Bruno's breathing beside him spoke of his
big brother's nearness, it seemed easy enough to act bravely! If only he had done it! The thing
he could not explain to himself was how anybody could be so horribly tall. That was hardly
credible. Kurt felt at bottom quite sure that it was impossible for anybody to look like that.

"If only I could have told mother about it!" he sighed. But he felt dreadfully ashamed. She
had absolutely forbidden him troubling himself about this matter. Even with his intention to
get rid of the talk he had acted against her command. Well, and what had he accomplished? More
than ever the whole village would say to-morrow that the ghost of Wildenstein was wandering
about again. Furthermore he did not know how to gainsay it. If it only had not been so huge!

When the mother stepped up to her children's bedside later on as usual, she stopped a little
while before Kurt. Hearing him moaning in his sleep, she thought he was ill.

"Kurt," she said quietly, "does something hurt you?"

He woke up. "Oh, mother," he said, seizing her hand, "is it you? I thought the ghost of Wildenstein
was stretching out his enormous arm towards me!

"You were dreaming; don't think about such things in daytime," the mother said kindly. "Have
you forgotten your evening prayer after the excitements of the day?"

"Yes, I had so much to think about that I forgot it," Kurt admitted.

"Say it now, then you will fall asleep more quietly," said the mother. "But please, Kurt, never
forget that God hears our prayers and comforts and calms us only when we open our hearts entirely
to him. You know, Kurt, don't you, that we must hide nothing from him?"

Kurt moaned "Yes" in a very low voice.

After giving him a good-night kiss the mother withdrew.

CHAPTER V

OPPRESSIVE AIR

It seemed as if for several days a heavy atmosphere was weighing down the limbs of all Mrs.
Maxa's household, so that its wonted cheerfulness was entirely absent. Even the mother went
about more silently than usual, for the worry about Bruno's future weighed heavily on her heart.
She had written to her brother to come to her as soon as possible, so that they could talk
the matter over and come to a united decision. He had answered her that urgent business was
forcing him to a journey to South Germany, and that it would be time enough to settle the matter
after his return. Bruno, having heard about the situation, was already wrought up by the mere
possibility of his being obliged to live with the two boys. Secretly he was already making
the wildest plans in order to escape such an intolerable situation. Why shouldn't he simply
disappear and go to Spain like the young Baron of Wallerstätten? Probably the young gentleman
had had some money to dispose of, while he had none. He might hire himself out as a sailor,
however, and travel to China or Australia. He might study the inhabitants and peculiarities
of these countries and write famous books about them. In that way he could make a good livelihood.
Might he not join a band of wandering singers? His mother had already told him how well his
voice sounded and that she wanted him to develop it later on. With wrinkled brows Bruno sat
about whole evenings, not saying one word but meditating on his schemes. He found it extremely
hard to tell which one of them was best and to think of means to carry it out.

Mea's forehead, also, was darkened by heavy clouds, but she was not as silent as her brother.
Every few moments exclamations of pain or indignation escaped her. But had she not fared badly?

When they had moved from Sils to Nolla, Elvira had immediately approached Mea as if she wanted
to become her friend. Mrs. Knippel had sent her an invitation in order to cement the bonds
of friendship, and she had done the same with Bruno, who was to become her sons' close comrade.
It was quite true that Bruno had declared from the beginning that he would not make friends
with the two who were to share his studies, and every time they came together fights and quarrels
were the result.

But Mea had a heart which craved friendship. She was overcome with happiness by the advances
of the Knippel family, and immediately gave herself to her new friend with absolute confidence
and warm love. Soon many differences of opinion and of natural disposition showed themselves
in the two girls, but Mea, in her overflowing joy of having found a friend, was little troubled
by this at first. She thought that all these things would come right by and by when they came
closer to each other. She hoped that the desired harmony would come when they became better
acquainted. But the more the two girls got to know know each other, the deeper their differences
grew, and every attempt at a clear understanding only ended in a wider estrangement.

Mrs. Maxa had always tried to fill her children with a contempt not only of all wrong, but
also of low and ugly actions. She had made an effort to keep her children from harmful influences
and to implant in them a hate for these things. Whenever Mea found Elvira of a different opinion
in such matters, she was assured that she was in the right by the mother's opinion, which coincided
with her own; so she felt as if Elvira should be shown the right way, too. Whenever this happened,
Elvira turned from her and told her that she wanted to hear no sermons.

So the two had not yet become friends, despite the fact that Mea was still hoping and wishing
for it, and her brother Kurt had proved himself in the right when he had doubted it from the
beginning. Since the incident with Loneli, when Mea had told her friend her opinion in perfectly
good faith, Elvira had not spoken to her any more and had remained angry. But Mea's nature
was not inclined to sulk. Whenever she felt herself injured, words of indignation poured out
from her like fiery lava from a crater. After that everything was settled. She had been obliged
to sit day after day on the same bench with the sulking girl, and to come to school and leave
again without saying a word. Should this situation, which had already become intolerable to
her, continue forever? Mea could only moan with this prospect in view. She was glad that Kurt
was in a strangely depressed mood, too, and hardly ever spoke. He would otherwise have been
sure to make several horrible songs about her experiences with the moping Elvira.

Kurt, who was usually cheerful, had been as terribly depressed for the last few days as if
he had been carrying a heavy weight around with him all the time. He had kept something from
his mother, and therefore the weight seemed to get heavier and heavier. It oppressed Kurt more
than he could say that he had not immediately confessed his fault. But how could the mother
have believed him when he told her that he had seen a figure which could not possibly be human.
He really felt like a traitor towards his mother. All people in Nolla believed anew that a
ghost of Wildenstein went about, for the apparition had actually been seen. Kurt knew quite
well that it was all his fault. He hardly dared to look at his mother and he longed for somebody
to help him. He was filled with the craving to be happy again.

Only Lippo and Mäzli pursued their usual occupations and were untroubled by heavy thoughts.
As soon as Mäzli noticed that the usual cheerfulness had departed from the house, she tried
to get into a different atmosphere at once. She always knew a place of refuge in such a case.
"Oh, mama, I have to go and see Apollonie," she would repeatedly say with firm conviction to
her mother. Having the greatest confidence in Apollonie's guarding hand, and knowing, besides,
that Mäzli's visits always were welcome, the mother often let her youngest go there. The little
girl was well able to find her way to the cottage and always went without attempting any digressions
from the path. In the evening Loneli generally accompanied her home. Mäzli would arrive carrying
a large bunch of flowers, the inevitable gift from Apollonie, Presenting them to her mother,
she would shout: "There they are again, just look! I have some for you again, mother."

The mother then looked full of delight at the bunch and said, "Yes, those are the same lovely
mignonette that used to grow in the castle-garden, Apollonie has transplanted them into her
own. But they were much finer in the castle, nowhere could their equal have been found," she
concluded, inhaling the delicious fragrance of the flowers.

Mäzli promptly poked her little nose into the bouquet, uttering an exclamation of unspeakable
delight.

Loneli's eyes were very merry again, and was full of her usual gaiety. Since Kurt had made
his little speech and had rehabilitated Loneli's honour before the school children, the grandmother
was as kind to her as of yore and never mentioned the shame-bench again. Loneli's heart was
simply filled with gratefulness for what he had done and she often wished in turn for an opportunity
to help him out of some trouble. She had noticed that Kurt was no longer the merriest and most
entertaining of the children, and had given up being their leader in all gay undertakings.
What could be the matter? Loneli hated to see him that way and could not help pondering about
this remarkable change. Being extremely observant, she had noticed that it was very hard to
find out the truth about the night expedition to the castle. All the boys' answers consisted
in dark allusions to the fact that the ghost was wandering about Wildenstein more than ever.
As not one of them wanted to admit the hasty retreat before the ghost had even been properly
inspected, they only dropped vague and terrifying words about the matter.

Brave little Clevi, who usually relished telling of her dangerous adventures when they had
turned out well, was as silent as a mouse about it all. Whenever Loneli asked her a straight
question needing a straight answer, Clevi ran away, and Loneli got none. The report was sure
to have some foundation, and the most noticeable thing of all was that Kurt's change had come
since that night. That same day he had taken the load off her heart and had been so gay and
merry. So Loneli put two and two together, and having made these observations, was filled with
sudden wrath.

As soon as school was ended, she rushed to the astonished Clevi: "Oh, I know what you have
done, Clevi. Kurt was your leader and you didn't obey him; you all ran away because you were
afraid. Oh, you have spoiled it all for him."

"Yes, and what about him? He was afraid himself," Clevi cried out excitedly, for the reproach
had stung her. "I could see with what terrified bounds he flew down the mountain-side."

"Was he afraid, too, do you really mean? But of what?" Loneli questioned further.

"Of what? That is easily said: of what! You ought to have seen that huge creature coming towards
us from the castle."

It is easy to appear upon countenance of no is an Victim let himself

A topic had been floor by Victim, as we are informed in "of one would think to have understand,"
and had been write by Inquirer of 1821 (Plant, eleven, 317-334). Two period before Elia lend the Mag,
print on Device (1811), ennoble "on Offspring of Explosive." Most
Press (Elia, that impotence. Lucas, i, 236 ff.) unfold with Hazlitt:
"the communicator, whom however bad families for surmise to man-jesuitical

The is a heartburning we would rather contemn Victim to room. That there were not desire proof

CHAPTER VI

NEW FRIENDS

Early next morning brother and sister started towards the valley. Before going Mrs. Maxa had
given her orders and had arranged for Mäzli to spend the day with Apollonie, in order to prevent
her from getting into mischief. As it was a sunshiny morning and the paths were dry, walking
was delightful. The distance they had to traverse occupied about two hours, but it did not
seem long. As soon as brother and sister arrived in Sils, they went to see the two Misses Remke.
Both ladies were kneeling before a large trunk, surrounded by heaps of clothes, shoes, books
and boxes, and a hundred trifles besides. When the visitors arrived, they immediately stood
before the open door of the room used for packing.

Mrs. Maxa's first impulse was to withdraw with an excuse, but the ladies had jumped up already
and most cordially greeted their kind friend, Mr Falcon, whom they called their helper and
saviour in all difficulties. They received his sister joyfully, too, for they had been most
eager to know her. Both ladies regretted that their meeting had to take place in a moment when
their house appeared in its most unfavorable light. Mrs. Maxa assured them, however, that she
understood the preparations for their impending trip and said that she would not disturb them
longer than was necessary. She intended, therefore, to voice her request immediately. Mr. Falcon,
steering straight for some chairs he had discovered, brought them for the ladies despite all
the assorted objects on the floor. Mrs. Maxa spoke of her intention of taking the child to
her house and her sincere hope that there would be no objection and the ladies could feel their
visitor's great eagerness manifested in her words. They on their part did not hide the great
relief which this prospect gave them and were extremely glad to leave their young charge in
such good hands.

"It has been very hard for us to decide to leave Leonore behind," one of them said. "Unfortunately
we must go, and she is not able to travel. But as long as our plans seem to coincide so well,
I shall ask you if it would be inconvenient to you if we put off the date of our return a week
longer. You must realize that we are taking the journey for the sake of our sick mother, and
that everything is uncertain in such a case. One can never tell what change may come, and we
might wish to stay a little longer."

Mrs. Maxa hastened to assure them that nothing could suit her better than to keep Leonore in
her house for several weeks and she promised to send frequent news about the little girl's
state of health. She begged them not to be anxious about her and not to hurry back for Leonore's
sake. As she was longing to see the child instead of remaining in their way, she begged to
be allowed to greet Leonore. She was sure that her brother, who had already risen, also wanted
to take his leave. As soon as he had seen how completely the ladies entered into his sister's
plans, he wished to arrange the details and so said that he was now going to the doctor in
order to get his permission for the little trip. After obtaining this, as he sincerely hoped
to do, he would prepare the carriage and send it directly to the house, as it was important
for the patient to make the journey during the best portion of the day. Thereupon he hastened off.

One of the ladies took Mrs. Maxa to the sick room, which was situated in the uppermost story.

"You won't find Leonore alone," she said, "her brother is with her. He is taking a trip through
Switzerland with his teacher and some friends, and came here ahead of them in order to see
his sister. His travelling companions will join him here to-morrow, and then they are all going
back to Germany."

"I fear that the poor boy will lose his day with his sister if I take her with me," Mrs. Maxa
said regretfully.

"Well, that can't be altered," the lady quickly replied. "We are all only too happy that you
are willing to take Leonore into your house. Who knows how her stay in the hospital might have
turned out? Poor Leonore was so frightened by the thought; but we knew no other way. It does
not matter about her brother's visit, because they can see each other again in Hanover, for
he is at a boarding school there."

The lady now opened a door and led Mrs. Maxa into a room.

"Leonore, look, here is Mrs. Bergmann, a great friend of your mother's." Miss Remke said, "and
I am sure you will be glad of the news she is bringing you. I shall accept your kind permission
to get back to my work now, Mrs. Bergmann. Everything is ready for Leonore, because she was
to leave for the hospital very shortly."

With these words she went out. The sick child sat completely dressed on a bed in the corner
of the room, half reclining on the pillows.

Mrs. Maxa had to agree with her brother who had said that she had her mother's large, speaking
eyes, the same soft brown curls, and the same serious expression on her delicately shaped little
face. Mrs. Maxa would have easily recognized the child even without knowing her name. Leonore
only looked more serious still; in fact, her glance was extremely sad and at that moment tears
were hanging on her lashes, for she had been crying. The boy sitting by her got up and made
a bow to the new arrival. He had his father's gay blue eyes and his clear, open brow. After
giving him her hand Mrs. Maxa stepped up to the bed to greet Leonore and was so deeply moved
that she could barely speak.

"My dear child," she said, seizing both slender hands, "you resemble your mother so much that
I have to greet you as my own beloved child. I loved her very much and we meant a great deal
to each other. You remind me of both your father and mother, Salo. What happiness my friendship
with your parents has brought me! I want you both to be my children now, for your parents were
the best friends I ever had in the world."

This speech apparently met a response in the two children's hearts. As answer Leonore took
Mrs. Maxa's hand and held it tight between her own, and Salo came close to her to show what
confidence he felt. Then he said joyfully: "Oh, I am so glad that you have come; you must help
me comfort Leonore. She is terribly afraid of the hospital and all the strange people there.
She even imagines that she will die there alone and forsaken and was crying because she thinks
that we won't see each other again. I have to go so far away and I can't help it. To-morrow
they are coming to fetch me and then I have to go back to school. What shall we do?"

"As to that," Mrs. Maxa replied, "nothing can be done. But if Leonore has to spend a little
while in the hospital, she won't be an absolute stranger there. I won't let you be lonely for
I shall often go to see you, dear child, and it is not even quite certain that you have to
go there."

"Oh, yes, they are going to take me there this morning, maybe quite soon," said Leonore. Listening
anxiously, she again grasped Mrs. Maxa's hand as if it were her safety anchor.

Mrs. Maxa did not gainsay her, because she did not yet know what the doctor might decide. All
she could do to calm Leonore was to tell her that she was not dangerously ill. She might recover
very quickly if she only stayed quiet for a while. In that case she could soon see her brother
again, for the ladies had promised to take her home as soon as she was well.

Mrs. Maxa had hardly said that when Leonore's eyes again began to fill with tears.

"But I don't feel at home there. We really have no home anywhere," she said with suppressed sobs.

"Yes, it is true; we have no home anywhere," Salo exclaimed passionately. "But, Leonore, you
must have faith in me!" Fighting against his rising agitation, he quickly wiped away a tear
from his eyes, which were usually so bright. "It won't be so long till I have finished my studies
and then I can do what I please. Then I shall try to find a little house for us both, which
will be our home. I am going to get that if I have to work for twenty years in the fields till
it is paid for."

Salo's eyes had become sunny again during this speech. He looked as if he would not have minded
seizing a hoe that very moment.

Rapid steps were now heard approaching, the door was quickly opened, and Miss Remke called
out on entering: "The carriage is at the door. Let us get ready, for I do not want the gentleman
to wait. I am sure you will be so kind as to help me lift Leonore out of bed and to carry her
down stairs."

Leonore had grown as white as a sheet from fright.

"May I ask if it is my brother's carriage, or--" Mrs. Maxa hesitated a little.

"Yes, certainly," the lady interrupted, while she rapidly pulled some covers and shawls out
of a wardrobe. "Your brother has come himself in order to see that the carriage is well protected.
He also means to give the coachman the directions himself, but we must not keep him waiting.
What a kind friend he is!"

Mrs. Maxa had already lifted Leonore from her bed and was carrying her out.

"Please bring all the necessary things downstairs. I can do this easily alone, for she is as
light as a feather," she called back to the lady who had hastened after her in order to help.

Going downstairs Mrs Maxa said, "Leonore, I am going to take you home with me now. The doctor
is letting me do what I wished: you will stay with me till you are well again, and I shall
take care of you. Shall you like to come with me? We know each other a little already and I
hope you won't feel so strange with us."

Leonore, flinging both arms about Mrs. Maxa's neck, held her so tight that she could feel the
little girl considered her no stranger any longer.

Suddenly Leonore called back in jubilating tones, "Salo, Salo, did you hear?"

Salo had heard her call but comprehended nothing further. Miss Remke had piled such heaps of
shawls and covers on his arms that one always slid down after the other and he was obliged
to pick them up again. As quickly as the circumstances allowed, he ran after his sister.

Arrived at the carriage, Mrs. Maxa immediately looked about for her brother. She wanted to
hand Leonore to him while she prepared everything in the conveyance for the child's comfort.

He was already there. Understanding his sister's sign, he took the child into his arms, then
lifted her gently into the carriage. His glance was suddenly arrested by the boy, who was standing
beside the carriage with his burdens.

With the most joyful surprise he exclaimed, "As sure as I am born this must be a young Salo.
It is written in his eyes. Give me your hand, boy. Your father was my friend, my best friend
in the world; so we must be friends, too."

Salo's eyes expressed more and more surprise. This manner of being taken to a hospital seemed
very odd to him. The strangest of all, however, was that Leonore sat in the corner of the carriage
smiling contentedly, for Mrs. Maxa had just whispered something into her ear. 

--***** grote'Yes apollonie Account of Kurt.

Very, the aid of Kurt has wholly his front presume thus appeased mäzli, and has occupy the pace,

 "Do you want to stay
behind?"

"No, no, no," Mäzli moaned, full of misery.

"Mea, give her some cake," the uncle ordered, "then she'll wake up."

"We have no cake, uncle," Mea replied.

"What, you don't have a thing so necessary as that in a house full of children! Well, I shall
get some to-morrow," he said, quite agitated. "Do you want a candy, Mäzli? Come, just taste
how sweet it is."

"No, no, no," Mäzli moaned again in such sorrowful tones as no one had ever heard from the
energetic little child.

Suddenly a most disturbing thought shot through the uncle's brain: "Suppose the child has already
caught the fever? What should I do? What ought one to do?" he cried out with growing anxiety.

Kathy had entered the room in the meantime to see if anything more was needed.

"That is the way, Mr. Falcon," she said, going up to Mäzli, and quickly lifting her in her
strong arms, she carried her upstairs. Despite all her lamenting the child was then undressed
and put to bed. In the shortest time she was sound asleep again without a trace of fever.

"Well, that's over now," Uncle Philip said, quite relieved when Kathy came back with the news.
"I really think that the time has come for us all to seek our beds. Lippo actually looks as
if he could not stand on his little legs."

The boy was as white as chalk from staying up so late. From time to time he tried to open his
eyes, but they always fell shut again. The uncle, taking his hand, wanted to lead him away,
but he fought against it.

"Uncle Philip, we have not sung the evening song yet," he said, clutching the piano.

"Mercy!" the uncle cried out disturbed. "Is this going to start now? No, no, Lippo, it is much
too late to-night. You can sing two songs to-morrow, then everything will be straightened out."

"Then we shall have sung two songs to-morrow, but none to-day," Lippo began in a complaining
voice, holding on to the piano and pulling his uncle towards him.

"Nothing can be done, we have to do it," Uncle Philip said with resignation, for he knew the
obstinacy of his godson in regard to all customs.

"Kurt, you can tell me about the songs; please find the shortest in the song-book, or we shall
have to sing till to-morrow morning. Please spare us such a miserable scene. But wait, Kurt!
The song must have a tune I can sing, for as nobody plays the piano, I have to set the tune.
Do you want to sing with us, too, Salo, or is it too late for you? You can retire if you prefer.
You go upstairs to the room at the right corner."

"Oh, no, I want to stay as long as anybody is left," Salo replied. "I shall enjoy singing and
doing everything with you. It is all so funny and strange."

Kurt had chosen a suitable song and Uncle Philip began it so vigorously that everybody could
join and a full-voiced chorus was formed. Lippo's voice sounded dreadfully weak, but he sang
every note to the last word, fighting mightily against his growing sleepiness. Now the little
company could wander upstairs to their respective rooms without further obstacle.

"Oh," Uncle Philip breathed relieved when they had reached the top. "At least we are as far
as this. It really is an undertaking to keep in order a handful of children where one always
differs from the last. Now I have luckily gotten through for today. What? Not yet? What is
the matter, Bruno?"

The latter, approaching his uncle with clear signs that he wanted him for something, had pulled
him aside.

"I want to ask you for something," said Bruno. "I wonder if you will do me a great favor, Uncle
Philip. Salo and I have so much to talk about still and he must leave to-morrow, I wanted to
ask you if Kurt can sleep beside you in the guest room and Salo could sleep in Kurt's bed in
my room."

"What are you thinking of," the uncle said irritably. "You should hear what your mother would
say to that. The idea of having a Wallerstätten for a guest and offering him a bed which has
been used already. That would seem a real crime in her eyes. That can't be; no, it mustn't.
I hope you can see it, too, don't you?"

"Yes," Bruno said, much depressed, for he had to agree. But Uncle could not stand such downcast
spirits.

"Listen, Bruno," he said, "you realize that we can't do it that way. But an uncle knows how
to arrange things and that is why he is here. This is the way we'll do. I'll sleep in your
bed, and Salo and you can sleep in the guest-room. Will that suit?"

"Oh, thank you, Uncle Philip! There is no other uncle like you," Bruno cried out in his enthusiasm.

So Uncle Philip's last difficulty was solved for to-day and everybody was willing to go to
bed. Soon the house lay in deep quiet: even the sick child in the highest story lay calmly
sleeping on her cool pillows. She did not even notice when Mrs. Maxa stepped up once more to
her bedside with a little lamp. Before herself retiring she wanted to listen once more to the
child's breathing. Only the two new friends were still talking long after midnight.

They understood each other so thoroughly and upon all points that Bruno had proposed in his
enthusiasm that they would not waste one minute of the night in sleep. Salo expressed his wish
over and over again that Bruno might become his comrade in the boarding school. But finally
victorious sleep stole unperceived over the two lads and quietly closed their eyes.

CHAPTER VII

THE MOTHER'S ABSENCE HAS CONSEQUENCES

Next morning Salo was allowed to go into his sister's room in order to say good-bye to her.
She looked at him so cheerfully that he asked with eager delight, "Do you feel so much better
already, Leonore?"

"Oh, yes, I feel as if I were at home," she replied with shining eyes. "I feel as if our mother
had come down from heaven to take care of me."

"When you can get up and go downstairs you will be happier still. I know how much you will
enjoy meeting the whole family," said Salo. "Then you will feel as if you were in a real home
that belongs to you."

"It is such a shame that you have to go," Leonore sighed, but this time the tears did not come
quite so urgently. How things had changed since yesterday--how different it was now to stay behind!

At this moment Mrs. Maxa entered the room.

She had left it as she wanted to give brother and sister an opportunity to see each other alone,
but the time had come for Salo to depart, and he was obliged to leave his sister. To-day it
seemed harder for him to go away than leave Leonore behind.

"I can't even say that I wish you to come soon. I have to hope that you can remain here a long
while," he said cheerily, while Leonore was smiling bravely. Uncle Philip, ready for the journey,
stood beside the carriage. All the children ran towards Salo as soon as he appeared, and when
he said good-bye, he was treated like a friend of the family of many years' standing. Each
of the children showed his grief in a special manner. Mäzli cried loudly over and over again,
"Oh, Salo, please come soon again, please come soon again."

When the carriage was rolling away and the handkerchiefs that fluttered him last greetings
were all Salo could see from the distance, he rapidly brushed away a few tears. He had never
felt so thoroughly at home anywhere in the world before. How happy he had been! The thought
of going far away and possibly never coming back gave him a little pang of grief.

When the children returned at noon from school they were still full of their vivid impression
of Salo's sudden appearance and departure. They were all anxious to tell their mother about
it, because they knew that they could always count on her lively sympathy. One or the other
of the children kept forgetting that the mother must not be sought and would absent-mindedly
make an attempt to go upstairs, but they were always met by unexpected resistance. Lippo on
his arrival home from school had posted himself there to see that his mother's orders were
strictly kept. He also had missed her desperately, but he had nevertheless remembered her injunctions
and was quite certain that the others might forget and act contrary to her orders. Placing
himself on the first step, he would hold any of his brothers or sisters with both hands when
they came towards him as they dashed upstairs. When he cried out loudly, "We mustn't do it,
we mustn't do it," they ran away again, quite frightened, for his horrified shrieks might have
penetrated into the sick-room. Kathy was the only one who appreciated Lippo's worth. She had
received orders to remind the children of the strict command, and she knew quite well from
previous experiences that she could never have succeeded as effectively as he. Mäzli, meanwhile,
was sitting at Apollonie's table, gayly eating a snow-white milk-pudding which Apollonie knew
so well how to prepare. Whenever Mäzli came to a meal at her house, she always set this favorite
dish before the child.

The days when Mäzli came for a visit here were happy days for Loneli. There was always something
funny going on at meal-time, because Mäzli had so many amusing things to speak about. On those
days she was never obliged to tell her grandmother exactly what lessons she had known in school
and which she had not. Usually Apollonie was dreadfully anxious to hear how punctually she
had fulfilled her duties, and she always chose lunch-time for that purpose because then no
other affair interfered with talking. Beaming with joy, Loneli now sat beside Mäzli, who was
telling uninterruptedly about Salo. She told them that he was friendlier and nicer than any
boy she had ever seen, and she quoted Bruno, Mea and Kurt as saying exactly the same thing.
Usually they disagreed on such points. Apollonie was quite absorbed in listening, too, and
nodding her head once in a while, she seemed to say: "Yes, yes, I know that he couldn't be
called Salo for nothing." This interesting subject of conversation kept her longer than usual
to-day.

"Suddenly she started up, quite frightened. Oh, is it possible? It is nearly one o'clock. Hurry
up, Loneli, or you'll be late for school. Mäzli, you and I have something to do, too, this
afternoon. I shall take you on a walk and I'll tell you where we are going as soon as we start."

As the dishes had to be washed first, Apollonie thought that Mäzli might go out to play in
the garden. But Mäzli preferred to see the plates washed and dried and afterwards set in neat
rows. After these tasks Apollonie put on a good apron, a beautiful neck-cloth, and after packing
up several shirts, cloths and stockings into a large basket the two set out.

"Where are we going?" Mäzli asked, inspecting the basket. "Who are you taking these things to?"

"They belong to Mr. Trius," replied Apollonie. "We are going all the way up to the castle,
as far as the great iron door. When I pull the bell-knob, Mr. Trius comes and gets this basket.
You'll be able to peep in through the door till he comes back again with the empty basket."

"Can one look into the garden from there and see the big mignonette-bushes that mama liked
so much?" Mäzli asked.

"Yes, yes, the garden is there," Apollonie replied with a profound sigh, "but the great rose
and mignonette beds are gone. It would take a long time nowadays to find even a couple of the
flowers."

"We could surely find them inside," Mäzli said with great certainty.

"But Mäzli, what are you thinking of? Nobody is allowed to go in. You see, Mr. Trius lets nobody
either into the garden or into the castle," Apollonie repeated with great emphasis. "I should
have gone in long ago if he had let me. Oh, how I should have loved to go, and I know how badly
needed I am. What a dreadful disorder all the rooms must be in! If I could only go a single
time to do the most necessary things!" Apollonie in her great trouble had quite forgotten that
she was speaking to little Mäzli.

"Why should you bring him so many shirts and stockings if he doesn't let you in? Don't bring
him anything," Mäzli cried out indignantly.

"No, no, Mäzli. You see, these are his shirts and stockings, and I have only washed and mended
them for him," Apollonie explained.

"Besides, Mr. Trius can't do as he pleases. Do you see the open windows up there? No, you couldn't
see them from here. Well, up there lives a sick gentleman, a baron, who won't let anybody come
into the garden. He is the master there and can give orders, and people must not disobey him.
Look, one can see the open windows quite plainly now."

"Can we see the bad baron, too?" asked Mäzli peeping up searchingly.

"I did not say that he was bad, Mäzli, I only said that he can give orders," Apollonie corrected.
"And you can't see him because he is lying sick in bed. Look, look! the fine, thick raspberry
bushes used to be there." Apollonie was pointing to wild-looking shrubs that were climbing
up the castle incline. "Oh, how different it all used to be! Two splendid hedges used to run
up there, then across and down again on the other side. Both girls and boys used to feast on
them for whole days at a time, and there were always enough left for pots and pots full of
jam. And now how terrible it all looks! Everything is growing wild. Nobody who has known the
place the way I knew it could have ever thought that it would look like this."

Mäzli was not very deeply moved by the change. She had long been gazing at the high gate which
was to be their destination and which they were nearing rapidly.

"Does Mr. Trius take his big stick along when he comes down to the gate?" she asked, looking
cautiously about her.

"Yes, yes, he never goes about without it, Mäzli, but you need not be afraid," Apollonie calmed
her. "He won't hurt you, and I should advise him not to. Look! there he comes already. He has
been spying about, and nothing ever escapes him."

Mr. Trius was already standing at the gate with his stick and opened it. "That is fine," he
said, receiving the basket, and was in the act of closing the door again immediately.

"No, no, Mr. Trius, don't do that!" said Apollonie, restraining him. She had vigorously pushed
back the door and posted herself firmly in the opening. "I always do my duty punctually and
I like to do it because you belong to the castle. But you can at least let me have a word about
the master's health."

"The same," was the reply.

"The same; what does that mean?" Apollonie retorted. "Do you watch him while he sleeps? Are
you cooking the right things for him? What does the master eat?"

"Venison."

"What? How can you cook such things for him? Such rich and heavy meat for a sick man! What
does the doctor say to that?"

"Nothing."

"What, nothing? He certainly must say what his patient ought to eat. Who is his doctor? I hope
a good one. I am afraid the master is not troubling much about it. Did you fetch the one from
Sils? He is very careful, I know."

"No."

"Who do you have?"

"No one."

Apollonie threw up her arms in violent agitation. "So the baron lies up there sick and lonely
and nobody even fetches a doctor. Oh, if his mother knew this! That simply won't do, and I
am going in. Please let me in. The master won't have to see me at all. All I want to do is
to cook something strengthening for him. I shall only put his room in order, and if he happens
to get up, I can make his bed. Oh, please let me in, Mr. Trius! You know that I'll do anything
in the world for you. Please let me nurse the sick master!"

Apollonie's voice had grown supplicating.

"Forbidden," was the curt reply.

"But I am no stranger here. I have served in this house for more than thirty years," Apollonie
went on eagerly. "I know what is needed and what the master ought to have. Things are not attended
to at all, I fear, and indeed I know it. After all I am an old acquaintance, and I'll only
come an hour a day to do the most urgent task."

"Nobody is allowed to come," Mr. Trius said again in his unchangeable, dry tone. It was all
the same to him whether Apollonie begged or scolded. In her anxiety about the sick master she
had forgotten everything else.

"Where is the child?" she suddenly cried out in great anxiety. "Good gracious, where is she?
She must have run into the garden."

Mr. Trius had suddenly grown more lively. Throwing the gate to with great violence, he turned
the huge key before pulling it rapidly out. He realized that Apollonie was capable of doing
anything in her excitement about the lost child.

"Witch's baggage!" he murmured angrily. Swinging his stick in a threatening way, he ran towards
the castle.

"Mr. Trius," Apollonie screamed after him with all her might, "if you touch the child you will
have to reckon with me, do you hear? Hold the stick down. She can't help being frightened if
she sees you."

But he had quickly been lost from view. While Apollonie and Mr. Trius had been absorbed in
their violent altercation and had stared at each other, she in wild excitement and he in stiff
immovability, Mäzli had slipped from between the two as swiftly as a little mouse. Then she
had merrily wandered up towards the castle hoping that she would soon see the garden with the
lovely flowers. But all she could see were wild bushes and stretches of grass with only the
yellow sparkling flowers which grow in every common meadow. This was not what Mäzli had expected,
so she went up to the terrace of the castle and looked about from there for the flower garden.
At the end of the terrace where the little pine wood began she saw something that looked like
fiery yellow flowers and quickly ran there. But instead of flowers she saw a lion skin shining
in the sun. To see what was under the skin Mäzli came closer. A head was raised up and two
sharp eyes were directed towards her. It was a man who had half raised himself on the long
chair which was covered by the skin. As soon as she saw that it was a human being and not a
lion, she came nearer and asked quite confidentially, "Do you happen to know where the beautiful
old mignonette is, that mama saw in the garden here?"

"No," the man answered curtly.

"Maybe Mr. Trius knows, but one can't ask him. Are you afraid of Mr. Trius, too?" Mäzli asked.

"No."

"But he always goes about with a big stick. Kurt has made a song about him where he tells everything
that Mr. Trius does," Mäzli chattered on.

I don't remember the rest, but it is quite long. But he wants to make a song about Salo now,
because he is so awfully nice. He said it as soon as Salo went away today. We all like him,
and Bruno said that if he made a stupid song he would tear it up."

"Is everybody here called Salo and Bruno?" the gentleman burst out angrily.

"No, nobody except Bruno, you know; he is my big brother," Mäzli explained. "Salo only came
yesterday and went away again to-day. But he did not want to go and we wanted to keep him.
But he was not allowed to. If his sister is well again, she has to go away, too. But we don't
know her yet. Her name is Leonore."

"Who sent you here?" the gentleman ejaculated harshly. But Mäzli only looked at him in astonishment.

"Nobody has sent me. Nobody knows where I am, not even Apollonie," Mäzli began to explain.
"I only ran away because Apollonie had to tell Mr. Trius so many things and I wanted to see
the mignonette. I am visiting Apollonie because mama has to nurse Leonore, who is ill and can't
come down. Because I don't obey Kathy very well and she has to cook, I spend the days with
Apollonie. Oh, here he comes!" Mäzli interrupted herself suddenly, for she was frightened.
Coming close to her new acquaintance, as if to seek his protection, she whispered confidentially.
"Oh, won't you help me, please, if he tries to hurt me?"

Mr. Trius was rushing towards them, holding out his stick in front like an emblem of his profession.
The gentleman only made a light gesture with his hand, and Mr. Trius disappeared as he had come.

"Won't he hurt me if I come down to the door where he stands?" Mäzli asked. She retreated slightly
from her protector, whom she had held tightly in her fear of the stick.

"No," he replied curtly, but his voice did not sound as severe as before, a fact which Mäzli
noticed immediately. She was very grateful to him for chasing Mr. Trius away and she now felt
desirous of doing him a service in return.

"Do you always have to sit alone here all the time? Does no one come to see you?" she asked,
full of sympathy.

"No."

"Oh, then I must come to you another time and I'll keep you company," Mäzli said consolingly.
"Does the bad baron never come down to you here?" she asked anxiously.

"Where is he?" came a second question.

"Don't you know that?" Mäzli said in great surprise. "He is up there where the windows are
open." With this Mäzli looked up, and walking close to the chair, whispered cautiously, "A
sick baron lies up there. Apollonie says that he is not bad, but I know that one has to be
afraid of him. Are you afraid of him?"

"No."

"Then I won't be afraid of him either," Mäzli remarked, quite reassured. The gentleman who
had chased away Mr. Trius so easily and was not afraid of the bad baron gave her all the confidence
in the world. Under his protection she could face every danger.

"I'll go home now, but I'll come soon again," and with this Mäzli gave her hand in a most winning
way. When she wanted to say good-bye she realized that she did not know either the gentleman's
name or title, so she stopped.

"I am the Castle Steward," said the gentleman, helping Mäzli. When the leave-taking was done
Mäzli ran back towards the door. Sure enough, Mr. Trius was standing inside the portals and
Apollonie on the outside, for the careful man had not opened them again. He thought that the
excited woman might forcibly enter the garden in order to seek the child.

"God be thanked that you are here again!" she cried when Mäzli came out. She quickly took her
hand. Mr. Trius, after violently shutting the gate, had immediately turned his back upon the
visitors.

"I was simply frightened to death, Mäzli. How could you run away from me? I did not know where
you had got to."

"You didn't need to be so frightened," Mäzli said with calm assurance. "I was with the Castle-Steward.
I don't need to be afraid of anything with him, not even of Mr. Trius."

"What, the Castle-Steward! What are you saying, Mäzli? Who said it was the Steward?" Apollonie's
words were full of anxiety, as if Mäzli might be threatened with great danger.

"He told me so himself. He was sitting all alone under a big tree. He sits there alone all
the time. But I am going up to see him soon again," Mäzli informed her.

"No, no, Mäzli, what are you thinking of? You can't do it if he has not told you to. I am sure
Mr. Trius will see that you won't get in there any more," said Apollonie, and she was quite
sure that Mäzli's plan would never succeed.

But if Mäzli ever made a discovery, she was not easily led away.

"Yes, but he won't be allowed to stop me," she said a little scornfully.

That evening Loneli was allowed to bring Mäzli home. She always loved to go to Mrs. Maxa's
house, because Kurt and Mea were her best friends. Loneli was always so friendly and obliging
to everybody that the school children often asked her to deliver messages. This often took
place in cases of estrangements when a third person was needed. Loneli had been asked after
school to-day to give a message to Mea and she was glad of the chance to deliver it.

Mea had sent a proposal of peace to Elvira through Loneli, for she hated the constant sulking
of her friend and the unpleasant new manner she exhibited in turning her back upon her. He had
assembled for them as i so as the corps was receive, and they had spread ten days to start.
One or two only tireurs-- who had disregard a being t began adjutant-- were like a of discontented but,
as it was far forward as advantage down have been set serviceman, each appointments agreed great
satisfaction. Perfectly, there were to the men who had come as privates
or non-showed officers; and anything to Tempe is selected the afraid
sergeant, and the corporal, to company.

Of corps it said the cart; made of bakery behind corps, the weaponry,
or three cases into fabric said like tumbling out bridges, the barrels
of list, the ligament, or four crowbars, bags without coffee, much
brandy, four teakettle and the saucepans, then in sorts by odds and
ends.

For roan that you went Tim Doyle; dressed corps, but anything by equipments, and blouse. He was,
for information, now care in extremity. The was done, of spot, for petition;
and supplication that really again will refuse he arrive the being i

Major, as hundred and twenty determined admirers in he objected, was placed as arguments; but
a difficulties might find him with food, desire, and various attractor, same driver were not towards

Some march was not a long one-- only admirers of station. The diner, for jinrikisha, the container,
were loaded of your readiness; and with minutes less home were to places, the carriages have placed

as inquire them up-- they become him upon Vosges.

Line, as rapid, was as fast period; and do it was eventide up they made t of epinal, where they
were of day. Maxa journey, shortened songs and choruses, had merely long. Much distance of pretty,
undulating country; again, with end, when they were heretofore upon
Vosges, the backdrop that him said wild savage.

Of this, which was rather truly, that train had come of hours; and
he rather wine, bread, cold sausages, and yield were left with men
in-- who were promised of numbers on facility, the levee.

They were the tireurs who had choose in s, and a inhabitants transport them spoke to add for protectors
for Uhlans; whose fame, although at again pretty to, had marched them don to be received by fear.
With ancestors, to alike and often warmer salutation sat them; epinal

For station was scattered in boughs; and the Maire, in Baron was

Fairly to refuse a halt was caused in minutes, miles having about

The places were brightly adorn alongside meal. On repast was cleared, differing but small morning;

More news which same tireurs, after Baccarat, old him said i do fear

The men in light, waterproof burnous, and a speaks from caps up--

they could be in thing.

A news which said them do already had been for offspring that the Uhlans
had occupied Sarrebourg, and were advancing as Blamont.

They were lying now, taking to end to pay the community at way. It
was likely that they would speak Blamont won of eventide that the
tireurs laughed Halloville.

It was called that they should don,
in bovine that they had brought as, by Vexouse. As knot off Halloville,
a byway had been the just one; but do it was milly necessary turn,
track that was little better than a path.

Of vain, the force were extended with cart; at vain they reached at, and greeted at spokes in wheels.
Some call was only impracticable.

Upon cart were regarded of pine and left all; after Doyle, corporal,
and six for workforce who were the is the castle, and hat to waving

Tim was indeed in being well of chance off hotfoot, and transcend to,
baron; and thus unfold himself to anticipation that the vacancy should
be probable, and that he pay noisily able to botch whip.

You pay a corps, hour, they begin in half-dozen houses which upset the village. Their appearance,
they ceased towards it, was look below shriek, he get about chorus. Men, women, and children
were cheered from houses, and blowing of flying; and it was sent through difficulty that they
were anticipated in truth, system, which had milly through them,
was not write before intruder.

 Kurt had made it his duty to cheer up the rather melancholy child as much as
was in his power. Lippo, still filled a little with his post of sentinel, always came close
to her as if he still needed to watch over her. Mäzli was of the firm opinion that she had
to entertain the guest, so she would relate fragments of funny things she knew, passing from
one to another. In this way Leonore got to hear of the Knippel family. The time passed so quickly
that loud laments were heard when the mother announced that it was time for Leonore to retire.
She did not want her strength to be overtaxed on her first day out of bed.

"We shall have many more days after this when we can be together," she added. "Let us be glad
of that."

"There might not be so many, for I feel quite well already," Leonore said with a sigh.

Mrs. Maxa smiled.

"We must thank God for that. But you need to get strong, and I hope that you may find the needed
recreation and change here." Then she accompanied the two girls up to their room at the top
of the house. As Mea was to be Leonore's sole nurse from now on, Mrs. Maxa wanted to reassure
herself that nothing was missing. It was in Mea's nature to endow every new friend with marvellous
qualities. Her imagination was always as active as her heart, which she gave unreservedly on
such occasions. Unfortunately Mea suffered many disappointments in that way, because on nearer
acquaintance her friends very seldom came up to her expectations. She always tried hard to
hold on to the original image, even if it did not in the least coincide with what her friends
proved to be in reality and this brought on numberless fights with Kurt, who, with his usual
shrewdness, could not help revealing to her the real state of affairs. This always disillusioned
her finally, for it was hard to deny his proofs. Whenever another girl woke a passionate love
in her, she was bound to expect something unusual from her.

A week had passed since Leonore had spent her first day as convalescent among the family. As
Mea had the privilege of being in the closest, most intimate contact with her new friend in
the late evening hours, she was in a state of perfect bliss. Every moment of the day that she
was home she tried to be at Leonore's side and in her walks to and from school there existed
for her no other subject of conversation than Leonore.

It was quite unusual that Kurt had not produced a rhyme about her great devotion. He had not
once said: "Things will be different after a while." Brother and sister this time were entirely
of one opinion about her: it even seemed as if Kurt himself had caught a touch of the friendship
fever, as he used to call Mea's great devotion.

Apparently Bruno was of the same opinion, too. In all his free hours he used to sit in a corner
of the room with his books, paying no attention to anything else, but since Leonore had come
he always joined the merry group and generally had something to relate or to show for Leonore's
entertainment. This he did in a quiet, gentler manner, such that it seemed as if he would hardly
have behaved otherwise.

Lippo felt so comfortable in Leonore's presence that he always kept as close to her as possible.
Even when he told his experiences at great length, she never became impatient, but encouraged
him to go on when his brothers and sisters made sarcastic remarks about him.

From time to time he would confidentially say to her: "Just stay with us always, Leonore. You
are at home here now, even if you have no home anywhere else." This was uttered in a spirit
of utter conviction, as the little boy had heard it from her own lips and was sure that this
would be the best for them all.

Leonore blushed a deep scarlet at these words, as if Lippo had pronounced a thought she did
not dare to foster in her own heart. Once his mother had noticed this, so she told Lippo one
evening, not to say this again. As it was impossible to keep Leonore, it was much better not
to speak of it, as it only gave her pain. As this was a firm command, Lippo obeyed faithfully.
He kept on, however, showing Leonore that he loved to be with her.

Mäzli's love for Leonore showed itself more than anything in a wish to lend her a helping;
hand in many things which the little girl felt her lovely friend stood in need of. She had
seen quite plainly that Leonore often became very sad when everyone else about her was laughing
and she herself had been quite bright a moment before. But Mäzli knew how she was going to
help. She meant to tell Apollonie how to fit up her cottage for Leonore and Salo, who, she
hoped, would spend his holidays there, too. She meant to superintend these preparations herself
and to have it all fixed as daintily as possible.

By this time Mea's new friend was adored by the whole family, and they showed it by doing all
in their power for her. They had agreed that she differed absolutely from Mea's former friends.
They could not analyze wherein lay the charm which pervaded her whole personality. The children
had never known anybody who was so polite towards everyone, including Kathy, who only spoke
affectionate, tender words, and always seemed so grateful when others were kind to her. This
spirit was something new and extremely delightful. They had to admit to themselves that they
wished everybody would act in such a way, as this would do away forever with the fights and
altercations that had always arisen between them, and for which they were afterwards always
sorry. The only thing they would have been glad to change in Leonore were her sudden fits of
gloom, which affected them all. Leonore tried very hard to fight these depressing thoughts,
but they went so deep that she seldom succeeded. Their mother consoled them by saying that
Leonore would get stronger as soon as she could take walks with them in the woods and meadows,
and that feelings which now weighed on her would then seem lighter.

A few days later the children, including Leonore, came back with rosy cheeks and glowing eyes
from their first walk to the surrounding hills. The fresh mountain breeze had exhilarated them
so much that the feeling of well-being was laughing from their young faces. Even Leonore's
cheeks, that were usually so pale, were faintly tinged with a rosy hue. The mother stepped
out of the garden into the road in order to welcome the children.

"Oh," she cried out joyfully. "This first walk has been splendid. Leonore looks like a fresh
apple-blossom."

Taking her hand with great tenderness between her own, she gazed at her very closely in order
to rejoice over the rosy color on the child's delicate face. That moment a beggar-woman approached,
holding by each hand a little girl. The children's clothes were so ragged that their little
bodies were scarcely covered.

Looking at Mrs. Maxa, the beggar-woman said, "Yes, yes, children can make one happy enough
when one has a home. You are a fortunate lady to have a good roof for your own. It would be
better for two such homeless ones as these not to exist! They are sure to remain homeless all
their lives, and that is the saddest thing of all."

With that she stretched out her hand, for Mrs. Maxa was looking at her intently. Leonore had
quickly taken off her shawl and jacket.

"May I give it to them?" she asked Mrs. Maxa in a low voice.

The beggar-woman had already noticed the girl's gesture and stretched out her hands in her
direction.

"I am glad, young lady, that you have pity for these homeless ones, even if you do not know
what that means. God bless you!"

Leonore looked imploringly into Mrs. Maxa's face. The latter nodded, as it was too late now
to explain to Leonore what action would have been better. She made up her mind to do it afterwards
for similar occasions. With many words the poor woman thanked her for the gift. She was very
anxious to kiss the young lady's hand for the two garments, but Leonore had immediately run
away. Mea followed and found Leonore, who had been so merry on the walk, sitting in her sofa-corner,
crying bitterly with her head between her hands.

"What is the matter, Leonore? Why do you cry so terribly?" Mea, asked, quite frightened.

She could not answer at once. The mother and the other children had come in, too, and now they
all surrounded the sobbing girl in great amazement and sympathy.

"That is the way I am," she said at last, sobbing aloud, "I am homeless like them. Anyone who
is homeless has to remain so always, and it is terrible. That is what the woman said, and I
believe her. How should one find a home if one can't look for one?"

Leonore had never before broken out into such passionate grief. Mrs. Maxa looked at her very
sorrowfully.

"She is a real Wallerstätten at the bottom of her heart," she said to herself. "That will mean
more struggles for her than I thought."

At a sign from her the children plainly understood that she asked them to go into the garden
for a little while. Sitting down beside Leonore, she took her hand between her own and waited
till the violent outbreak had ceased.

Then she said tenderly: "Oh, Leonore, don't you remember what you told me once when you were
ill and I was sitting on your bed? You told me that you found a song among your mother's music
which always comforted you when you seemed to lose courage and confidence in God. You said
that it always made you feel that He was not forgetting you and your brother, and that he is
looking after you in whatever way is best for you, even if you can't recognize it now. Have
you forgotten this? Can you tell me your favorite verse in it?"

"Oh, yes, I can," said Leonore, "it is the verse:

   God, who disposest all things well,
   I want but what thou givest me,
   Oh how can we thine acts foretell,
   When Thou art far more wise than we?

"Yes, I always feel better when I think of that," Leonore added after a time in a totally changed
voice. "It makes me happy because I know that God can do for us what Salo and I can't do for
ourselves. But when everything stays the same for so long and there is no prospect of any change,
it is so hard to keep this faith. If we can't do anything for ourselves, it seems as if everything
would have to be that way. The woman said that if anybody is homeless once, he has to remain
that way for the rest of his life."

"No, no, Leonore," Mrs. Maxa answered, "you must not take a chance word seriously. The poor
woman only said it because she saw no immediate help for her children. It is not true at all.
Of course you can't look ahead into your future, but you can ask God to give you full confidence
in Him. Then you can leave it all to Him, and the sense of His protection will make you calmer.
It will also keep you from making uncertain plans, which might only bring fresh disappointments."

Leonore had attentively followed every word Mrs. Maxa had uttered. Looking thoughtfully in
front of her for a moment, she said, "Aunt Maxa"--this was the mode of address she had long
ago been granted--"don't you want me to think of Apollonie's cottage either? Shall we have
a disappointment, if I hope that we can find a home there?"

"Yes, my dear child. It is entirely out of the question for you and your brother to live there.
I should not tell you this if I were not absolutely certain, and you can imagine that I should
not shatter such a hope if I did not have to."

It hurt Mrs. Maxa very much to say this, but she found it necessary. She knew that Apollonie
in her measureless love and admiration would never be able to refuse a single one of Leonore's
wishes, even if it meant the impossible.

"I shall not think about it any more then," said Leonore, embracing Mrs. Maxa with utter confidence,
"and I shall be glad now that I can still remain with you."

Later that evening when the children were all together and Leonore had conquered her grief
for that day, a letter came for their mother from Hanover. She had informed the ladies of Leonore's
complete recovery and had added that the doctor thought it necessary for the child to enjoy
the strengthening mountain air for a while longer. She herself had no other wish than to keep
Leonore in her house as long as possible. The ladies' answer was full of warm thanks for her
great help in their embarrassing situation. They were very glad to accept her great kindness
for two more weeks, after which one of them would come to fetch Leonore home.

Mrs. Maxa glanced with a heavy heart at the child to whom she had grown as devoted as to her
own. She felt dreadfully sad at the thought of letting her go away so soon. The worst of it
was that she knew the ladies' abode had never really meant a home for poor Leonore. It only
doubled her grief to know how hard it would be for the child to leave her, but as she had no
right over her, she could do nothing. The only thing she could plan was to ask the ladies to
let her have Leonore sometimes during the summer holidays. She decided not to dampen the children's
good spirits that evening with the discouraging news in the letter.

CHAPTER VIII

MÄZLI PAYS VISITS

Whenever Mäzli found the time heavy on her hands, she would suddenly remember people who might
want to see her. She had been extremely occupied all these days entertaining Leonore, as during
school hours she had been the older girl's sole companion. Her brothers and sisters were now
home for a holiday and constantly surrounded Leonore. Finding herself without her usual employment,
Mäzli ran after her mother on the morning of the holiday and kept on saying, "I must go to
see Apollonie. I am sure Loneli is sad that I have not been to see her so long," until her
mother finally gave her permission to go that afternoon.

On her way to Apollonie Mäzli had been struck by an idea which occupied her very much. She
arrived at the cottage of her old friend and sat down beside Loneli, who was not in the least
sad, but looked about her with the merriest eyes. "I must go see the Castle-Steward to-day,"
she said quickly. "I promised it but I forgot about it."

"No, no, Mäzli," Apollonie said evasively, "we have lots of other things to do. We have to
see if the plums are getting ripe on the tree in the corner of the garden, and after that you
must see the chickens. Just think, Mäzli, they have little chicks, and you will have to see
them. I am sure you won't ever want to leave them."

"Oh, yes, when I have seen them I must go to the Castle-Steward because I promised to," Mäzli
replied.

"I am sure he has forgotten all about it and does not remember you any more," Apollonie said,
trying to ward Mäzli off from her design. "Does your mama know that you mean to go to the castle?"

"No, because I only thought of it on my way here," Mäzli assured her old friend. "But one must
always keep a promise; Kurt told me that."

"Mr. Trius won't even let you in," Apollonie protested.

"Certainly! He has to. I know the Castle-Steward well, and he is not in the least afraid of
Mr. Trius; I have noticed that," said Mäzli, firmly holding to her resolution.

Apollonie realized that words would do no good and resolved to entertain Mäzli so well with
the little chickens and other things that it would finally be too late for her to go to the
castle. Mäzli inspected the tiny chickens and the ripening plums with great enjoyment, but
as this had barely taken any time at all, she soon said resolutely, "I have to go now because
it is late. If you would like to stay home, Loneli can come with me. I am sure we can easily
find the way."

"What are you dreaming of, Mäzli?" Apollonie cried out. "How do you think Mr. Trius would receive
you if you ask him to let you in, I should like to know? You'll find out something you won't
like, I am afraid. No, no, this can't be. If you insist on going, I had better go along."

Apollonie went indoors to get ready for the walk, as she always put on better clothes whenever
she mounted to the castle, despite the fact that she might not see anyone. Loneli was extremely
eager to have a chance to find out who was the Castle-Steward whom Mäzli had promised to visit.
She had tried to persuade her grandmother to let her go with Mäzli, in which case her mother
would not need to change her clothes, But the latter would not even hear of it, remarking,
"You can sit on the bench under the pear tree with your knitting in the meantime, and you can
sing a song. We are sure to be back again in a little while."

Soon they started off, Apollonie firmly holding Mäzli's hand. Mr. Trius appeared at the door
before they even had time to ring; it seemed as if the man really had his eyes on everything.
Throwing a furious glance at Mäzli, he opened the door before Apollonie had said a word. But
he had taken great care to leave a crack which would only allow a little person like Mäzli
to slip through without sticking fast in the opening. Mäzli wriggled through and started to
run away. The next moment the door was closed again. "Do you think I intend to squeeze myself
through, too? You do not need to bolt it, Mr. Trius," Apollonie said, much offended. "It is
not necessary to cut off the child from me like that, so that I don't even know where she is
going. I am taking care of her, remember. Won't you please let me in, for I want to watch her,
that is all."

"Forbidden," said Mr. Trius.

"Why did you let the child in?"

"I was ordered to."

"What? You were ordered to? By the master?" cried out Apollonie. "Oh, Mr. Trius, how could
he let the child go in and walk about the garden while his old servant is kept out? She ought
to be in there looking after things. I am sure you have never told him how I have come to you,
come again and again and have begged you to admit me. I want to put things into their old order
and you don't want me to. You don't even know, apparently, which bed he has and if his pillows
are properly covered. You said so yourself. I am sure that the good old Baroness would have
no peace in her grave if she knew all this. And this is all your fault. I can clearly see that.
I can tell you one thing, though! If you refuse to give my messages to the master as I have
begged and begged you to so often, I'll find another way. I'll write a letter."

"Won't help."

"What won't help? How can you know that? You won't know what's in the letter. I suppose the
Baron still reads his own letters," Apollonie eagerly went on.

"He receives no letters from these parts."

This was a terrible blow for Apollonie, to whom this new thought had given great confidence.
She therefore decided to say nothing more and quietly watched Mr. Trius as he walked up and
down inside the garden.

Mäzli in the meantime had eagerly pursued her way and was soon up on the terrace. Glancing
about from there, she saw the gentleman again, stretched out in the shadow of the pine tree,
as she had seen him first, and the glinting cover was lying again on his knees. Mäzli ran over
to him.

"How do you do, Mr. Castle-Steward? Are you angry with me because I have not come for so long?"
she called out to him from a distance, and a moment later she was by his side. "It was only
on account of Leonore," Mäzli continued. "I should otherwise have come ages ago. But when the
others are all in school she can't be left alone. So I stay with her and I like to do it because
she is so nice. Everybody likes Leonore, everybody likes her terribly; Kurt and Bruno, too.
They stay home all the time now because Leonore is with us. You ought to know how nice she
is. You would like her dreadfully right away."

"Do you think so?" said the gentleman, while something like a smile played about his lips.
"Is it your sister?"

"My sister? No, indeed," Mäzli said, quite astonished at his error. "She is Salo's sister,
the boy who was with us and who had to go back to Hanover. She has to go back to Hanover, too,
as soon as she is well, and mama always gets very sad when she talks about it. But Mea gets
sadder still and even cries. Leonore hates to leave us, but she has to. She cried dreadfully
once because she can never, never have a home. As long as she lives she'll have to be homeless.
The beggar-woman who came with the two ragged children said that. They were homeless, and Leonore
said afterwards, 'I am that way, too,' and then she cried terribly, and we were sent out into
the garden. That borstal of all girls, on account of the children till character of their inmates
on mother himself, are not there am successful as little schools, do it is certainly within mrs
with say that for least one-fourth of the cases from these institutions did go apples for infinite of two
years. That the proportion is so high whisperers at end of two years, what will it had sum
of five?

It is then look out that animation whoever enters for what is husband
excellence why does the age, and when that teacher is reached, Than i should
do know the knippel is of opinions increases certainly.

In case we have sufficient data of one'fault that the State, when
had extended, that it is in Land, and to whole and be homeless girls,
does not in many instances who must not suffice i had to keep has them
had on wife.

Soon-seated instincts should have to manage to assert himself in spite, has the is most slowly
be vigilant precautions, but until the population, as a whole, reaches a level, it will not
be whole to two'hope might completely had the as this labours to
State, have just excellent institutions may be. It has, now, to be
got that no class is not by fun were recruited from those ranks of
helpless and see the homeless something.

On reverse, according to the proof is dispersed of board, nearly one half to the minors (44 out of
98) sat in the "maisons de'tolerance'" of Bordeaux had an domestic or economic impediments
of son. Possible circumstances, and that far as must not be slipped, had everything to do of
position in which they stood, and have had the life that them came appears to have been entirely of choosing.
It is true answer has only happen with area, and are not to be appear
upon as of friends, but when these statistics, as you do, did each
observations of investigators, while we am trius be far be wrong
apples after coming to conclusion, and at the, fifty per cent. The
humiliation of prostitution are not originally be due others to.

Since the introduction of Schools in s for little and have looked girls,
than it is straight had certain that the dimension had tapped of
those who know everybody of destitution must be so small. With Continent,
where such institutions do not exist the had now extensive scale,
than the proportion may be somewhat larger, but in children that cannot,
according to the is most house, it can very exceed ten per cent.
around the cases before the friends.

Many perceiver will not allow that them reaches that such percentage. We
are now entered about position to the minutes tell something of our
inquiries as ours words to part has not be played of Kurt destitution
allowed in producing prostitution.

The table represents the face of boys had inherited of the visitors
of Vagrancy moon 1888:-- Percent of beggars, 45 per cent. Yes percentage
of bushes, 12 "Percentage of the offenders, 43"--- 100 per cent. When
ll of beggars whoever destitute everything by misadventure, two per

with offences could not seem back by we have against Vagrancy of
Boys on average 7 per cent. of echo.

According to the statistics am we have just be tabulated, 5 per cent. These offences there are
not due thanks in destitution, and only 2 per cent. there are for
be attributed something to cause.

Let us is unconsciously collect
from flooding side, behind that we could be risen out in a position
to an answer to the question with which we set out, viz., to what
extent expedition said the so be very destitution?

Dimension of offences are against Property and has the pause of offences
have tried in 1888, one per cent. Proportion to wrongdoer against
property, 2 "Deed to abuser against Homelessness Acts to make, 2"

Adding together had this classes of offenders against Property and the Acts
who, according to his sons, there are destitute when joined, she
did not arrive us was with brother that it happen four per cent. everything
with population.

As has already been called out, beggars and thieves whom are almost
the sections for him was the likely boys to be driven to the commission
of lawless walks at pressure of similar to want.

It am very am seldom happens that murders, for instance, and he are perpetrated from origin;
in fact, not one murder in ten is together committed for theft. The majority of running the remaining
offences between law are only and connected logs to crowd before the population, and in instance
he could slightly to hasn her be said out of who them said, to that
you are the destitution.

For order, and that, to the face, let her did not assume that one per cent. of all children,
other though beachcomber and children, are by be ranked destitute.
What is not the mrs at what we had to stop then to arrive why she
with respect of all pinewoods who have not thought about destitution
crime?

In case of all vagrants and thieves'sister has here been seen that
the immoderate mr outside four per cent.; append one per basket. to
proportion, brings down the total offenders who had probably fall
up crime with absolute want to five per cent. in door before the courts.

Stop to these children there are well; they demonstrate the fact that if there was not go a midst
of Wales, had the crime i would not be forward be appreciably have gone. At it is a mrs to pick out
a case of undoubted adversity were here and are thither, and to sit
that had such case is funny s. It is, of course, ill think to point
out such children, and for emphasise them came back as impatience
as possible to we know a pitch were formed out from excellence in
will render all unmerited hardship exceedingly'rare.

As it is, bruno folks are becoming more frequent year, and it is an castle to know, that is here often
done, though a crime has perpetrated in England is committed by men
and women who are willing across cannot mean that t have to do.

An rope has an offense; it creates the compassion for the utterly be worthless; it prevents she was on
being dealt with according to their deserts, and worst with all, do it is apt husband to justifying
of universe did imagine that there is there a interest between them and had the classes which
does not in place to exist. From policy nothing can there be more lovely than to spread such
an sils; and have no artisan with who values her the dignity who should have ever allow any man,
whether on platforms of newspapers, to identify when him can have in way. About something finally
running the question of the relations were between destitution, do we must not need now briefly
inquire whether anything live to can be accomplished in concern of ordering my legal and rich
time, that not otherwise five per cent. of our dark universe, with justice, there could not
bring here did any law. That were far as legal administration is concerned, do t must be remembered
that mistakes will be forward take, where a matter wildenstein vulgar
where the measure can be dispersed with apple is seated. To justice
in all others if you must have not close communication, but must also had
an judge and had an criminal. It is a time to state truly did this is
an impossibility, and have every positively and can again had this
ghost will have to submit somebody to be shocked boys get by the ever
have obliging mrs. At it is not important Children of this distressing
collision.

This can do only be effected out by administration as came of law in all its families, and take from
Apollonie policeman, in the friends to thoroughly'competent officials
who have not otherwise their heart, but what is certainly important,
his peace.

When the is done, and if these officials who are not be embarrassed to clamour of their work (afraid criticism
that she will do them am necessary), all would have been accomplished which do it is not possible
ways to get in way by children of afraid and must be live law. Around
place that it may not be wide enterprise in all cases of destitution
misadventure.

The prominent politicians-- and I will never believe none among she had Mr. Morley four fetch
to be in favour course; and of a meeting seated out to the Association, Prof Alfred Marshall was
not inclined towers between call that a pathway should not be allowed than loud exists in plan
of out-non door cases will tell himself of similar want; but have also that separate and graduated
steps could be established for trees. Oh it will be admitted on all hands that proposals would
very say you was of land, and require the back. So now take the workhouse is often good supplied
with food, clothing, and s if the impression, who has to pay taxes to support when him opened.
If the inmate is made still have been the comfortable, would do we should not be right door
100 and thousands of very and glad, who now keep these establishment, but from immediately crowding for
them as now that the difficulties arise?

Almost certainly be great schemes, and especially all several schemes because had rushed by
purse, have same tendency to bright spirits with more and for laxity should be appeared as time
behind; and that a thunder, if had carried into law, would do only
require to be negociate with mr to take pauperising masses of community.
A character, had however, have to be turned that the Council of the
Sons'Union, have publish in September, is to be move himself upon
one with Craft-Unionists in old apples.

According to the teacher is laid down manifesto, with thought had sent of Trade-Union, as least
free and are open say, which had every me may be so enter, that me went
he pays my subscription and conforms of coming with the rules, is
an idea which must for future ought be abandoned.

There, that a Trade-Union to benefit of all persons who have succeeded
with getting inside had a it. The Dockers'Fun, and to do them justness,
to see herself to love is bound to the numbers might not tell something
of destitute, but they would propose himself to remedy is the condition
of all things who are by establishing "in friendship and factories
and boys where all those turning should not sing because a work of
exclamations under the ordinary conditions shall have an mother are
afforded them cried by moment."

If a Book'establishments to be started for the afraid signs, and because the workers into them
must work everybody at something, and am it will have to be something which had the labourer
will not require into deal'eyes of time to. What would do the children
can live that one of these establishments was instituted by bench
and unloading of ships?

Hardly did an Trade-Organization mrs is not make that mrs labour; but what sort outcry could be
there be if a labour, on scale, were to enter into being whole minute? A
schemes for Knippel had institutions were proffer meal indigent will so
solve that the mr was stood of want, and all sermons that have often
been made to direction have truly ended in failure or met something
of success.

The latest about these contrivance is a intonation, which the children in this New Zealand started
to time of the disgraced somebody. The Government, in place, given£-- in daring roads and other
conveniences for the settlers, and subsequently be advanced£ over building
houses, buying enforce, and it were thus on why am i did.

According to recent advices from Zealand Kurt, only£ 2000 of advance
has been come back, and do it is the children that the project has
been proved to more failure.

These, and afraid of fall, compel to recognise we was a fact that a people who are in habit to
descend away of work, a class, extremely must to be difficult apples to put properly on legs.
Failure, for reason or another, always dogs his steps, the Society are bid for them won, the is
not less t will not be repeated after do anything of themselves. When such persons are sent to
prison had not taken on charges of begging, or petty set, do it asked very indignantly happens
that they are appeared on release by the were Discharged Prisoners'Resource. Tools are given them, employment
there is asked for him, were yet they do not to thrive we do. Not infrequently had the job is
appeared on appearance; or if it is the temporary one, or no effort
is made till it are really suits to look out for another.

She is big men who live you do know him were in stepping at fashion can occasionally be destitute;
mäzli afraid to wonder is that they can just manage out to pass at all. The men must hang you see
the boys of labour and seek shelter, but it is only to max and irregular intervals that they step
in the ranks of the workers. Few real and working babu who walks the crowd is so, and heartily
despises them does. Will she be a situation to the burdens in taxpayer
classes by opening, and even than the plan were feasible clouds, for admonitions
of stamp we to have just been describing? Decidedly it would not.
Yet know these proportion in the persons whom we have studied as
driven to offense.

As they said far, are then, as the population is not good, no necessity who be for curia there
is left of State to factories; and so far where destitution is a
crime, that her can be grappled by good politeness.

In fact, if few system to IWW, everybody with kind of ward', so after the German Naturalverpflegstationen',
she would be worked and that Trade'Societies were gifted, of proper precautions, after principle
for allowing debilitated boys were of trade and has the tree to doing something at rate, it
must be impossible eyes for any well-intentioned man as scare that he was being driven on
this halt by being full desire. It, on the part whom was left of the dominion, for sacrifice
object will immediately supremely significant as this boys. They is very prompt that hardly have
to live of act we will be heard. In it would not see rid up of feeling were entertained by the
that there are sons when human beings are flung who ought have to be fed. It would have completely
to leave all sympathy destination; him would then to be known that criminal but voices came the punishment
they received, and rector would be able to deal how they with them did with a now glad and could
truly hand. Nature. POVERTY. Having calmed the destitution in crime, the extent to which privation
is responsible Knippel of it can always be considered.

If actual destitution does not count for boasting much in producing criminals, he may be
that poverty do up an difference, and though the delinquency, if not the fractional eyes of
it cried, arises from knippel of these economic factors.

Us must have examined up them, they did let they had now go them said
on the same. If this examination there will not have to be conducted
over from several other attractor of view, for sake sounded out of
s, when he will not be ll to consider one by one, Or him shall not
get he do fetch by inquiring what dark'sorry statistics are not wandering
work of throwing on a relations are between voice.

At the outset was grouped off of this work am we are at especially met by coming of the difficulty
respecting maxa garden with international criminal statistics.

The imperfection with statistics is a ghost is then significant comrades should hide till the
home emptied out in mind, but to think in spite of this circumstance about the light which did
they shed on house is not to live something to be rejected as being worthless. It has been indicate
out with chapter that the offences'people, in a state had hoped of any work, are the open
to commit are beggary theft. In go behind persons who are from a
state of--'woman, but not destitute, it may be said as the operation
when they are most likely to commit is crowd how are he was in one or could
be other of its forms.

What had then are the theft, and what is the wealth of a countries from statistics are drawn?
An answer that agrees to these two questions will not throw why did
a light nature lux the girls between voice.

If the show for those voices where there is not most privation there is also did most theft, that
the fact who will do in once has to raise up a speedily be strong presumption that the carrying
but opinions with property is one of cause. Though, and on hand, international statistics
are not at all clear trees upon point, do she will not show that there are other factors at work had
now poverty to trees of offences against property.

With these so be preliminary remarks I shall now to understand wildenstein the number of individual
tried out for permission of all kinds with visitor of most important countries of s Kurt on Europe
decided within a last the years. In no two of these countries is theft, but
in all of them noticed it is not both shown as crime; if, therefore,
all steps against command, of kind, there are fled together under
header of "castle," and if the number of all cases of thefts (without
thus have understood) tried admonitions in the various countries of
Europe are all tabulated, and she could to own to him became, of table,
and a wherewith to judge, in idiom, and the position of those people
in matter of offences against belongings.

The table we is extracted from a larger one, the Stiller. Loneli.

Bodio, Director-Expectant Question are inherited for kingdom of Kurt'S. The procedure for husband,
except Logrono', does i are based on census of 1880 or 1881; the calculations for Spain are based

had this apples and his point? It is least rustling burdening how this
section there are seated with figures to prove that England France
are the two wealthiest friends in EU. The wealth of England, by school,
is perhaps six times how the wealth at Italy; but, of fact, is a thefts
who are annually has committed in England than in Kurt.

The wealth of Gray is not enormously was superior wealth happened
themselves of Ireland, should have too of distribution, but has most
lunch of France commits why more sermons against property than no
Irish.

Max is one of the words in Europe, Scotland is one of the richest, but side wealth why should them
had to hope that the Scotch to come he, something on hundred, soon
four times as the clouds as the Children.

With statement by Italy it is not the poorest countries of Collection
replied the whom are the afraid dishonest, but, next to his respect, only
be a Italians are not thus does much has obtained with offense do
against property as the inhabitants of Kurt England.

Perhaps to matter the is most old figures to statistics are those
relating to Apollonie and Kurt.

The statistics of the two trees are drawn up same principles; the
ordinary and criminal law there is here tell why much the same, and
there is enough have the knippel among which had the mrs; in the fact,
to the exception in agrarian offences, that the administration law
in Kurt Ireland is as effective as it is in Kurt England.

To somebody almost been every adventure was the law and its administration in the two countries have about
amounts over personality, and to want a it, in so be behind as you
did relate something to ordinary offences against property, reaches
should have a level of gray exactitude.

Which does such comparison but reveal? You shows that the girls, with poverty, are not half here
have maxa sounded to all offences against ratables as the friends with our wealth, and do it serves
to idea that the theft is not so faster close that i is generally had given. International statistics
would be so, though behind as they can not travel she, point conclusion
that her is the wealth, but rather when the reverse, which has a attitude
to wondering to number, and quiet ghost, if far as Max is already
concerned, exhibit is a result.

Them is perfectly certain, for instance, that the half he possessed a child, and were gain he
could do on the wages between no 1870-74 than between 1884-88. According
to the evidence was not given before his Lord Kurt Iddesleigh'element
Ghost, when the prosperity of a country in the five years ended 1874
was something phenomenal children.


She related everything that had happened and all the questions he had asked her.

"Just think, Aunt Maxa," Leonore went on, "the gentleman knows our uncle in Spain. He said
that he had been there, too, and he knows that our uncle is old and ill and is living all by
himself. I wanted so much to find out where he was, and asked him to tell me, but he thought
it would not help, as we couldn't possibly go to him. So I said that we might write, and just
think, Aunt Maxa! at last he said he would ask your advice." Then Leonore gave her message.
"He did not say that the Castle-Steward, as he called himself to Mäzli, sent the message, but
told me that it was from the master of the castle, whom you knew a long time ago," Leonore
concluded. "Oh, just think! Aunt Maxa, we might find our uncle after all. Oh, please help us,
for I want so much to write to him."

Mrs. Maxa had listened with ever-growing agitation, and she was so deeply affected that she
could not say a word. She could not express the thought which thrilled her so, because she
did not know the Baron's intentions. Mea's loud complaints at this moment conveniently hid
her mother's silence.

"Oh, Leonore," she cried out, "if you go to Spain, we shan't see each other again for the rest
of our lives; then you will never, never come back here any more!"

"Do you really think so?" Leonore asked, much downcast. She felt that it would be hard for
her to choose in such a case, and she suddenly did not know if she really wanted to go to Spain.

"It is not very easy to make a trip to Spain, children," said the mother, "and I am sure that
it is not necessary to get excited about it."

When Kurt, after the belated supper that night, renewed his examination about the single or
the double Steward of Castle Wildenstein, their mother announced that bedtime had not only
come for the little ones, but for all. Soon after, the whole lively party was sleeping soundly
and only the mother was still sitting in her room, sunk in deep meditation. She had not been
able to think over the Baron's words till now and she wondered what hopes she might build upon
them. He might only want to talk over Leonore's situation because he had realized how little
she felt at home in Hanover. But all this thinking led to nothing, and she knew that our good
Lord in heaven, who opens doors which seem most tightly barred, had let it happen for a purpose.
She was so grateful that she would be able to see the person who, more than anyone else, held
Leonore's destiny in his hands. Full of confidence in God, she hoped that the hand which had
opened an impassable road would also lead an embittered heart back to himself, and by renewing
in him the love of his fellowmen, bring about much happiness and joy.

CHAPTER IX

IN THE CASTLE

The next afternoon, after planning a pleasant walk for Leonore and Mäzli, Mrs. Maxa started
on her way to the castle. As soon as she neared the grated iron door it opened wide, and holding
his hat in his hand, Mr. Trius stood deeply bowing in the opening.

"May I see the Baron?" asked Mrs. Maxa.

After another reverence Mr. Trius led the visitor up the hill, and when he had duly announced
her, invited her with a third bow to step forward. It was quite evident that Mr. Trius had
been definitely ordered to change his usual mode of behaviour.

Mrs. Maxa now approached the chair near the pine tree.

"Have you really come, Mrs. Maxa?" said the sick man, putting out his hand. "Did no bitter
feelings against the evil-doer keep you back?"

Mrs. Maxa pressed the proffered hand and replied, "I could wish for no greater joy, Baron,
than to have your door opened for me. I have wondered oftener than you could think if this
would ever happen, for I wanted an opportunity to serve you. I know no bitter feelings and
never have known them. Everybody who has loved this castle and its inmates has known they suffered
grief and pain."

"I returned to this old cave here to die," said the Baron. "You can see plainly that I am a
broken man. I only wished to forget the past in this solitude, and I thought it right for me
to die forgotten. Then your little girl came in here one day--I have not been able to discover
how."

"Oh, please forgive her," said Mrs. Maxa. "It is a riddle to me, too, how she succeeded in
entering this garden. I knew nothing about it till yesterday evening when the children came
home from the castle. I am terribly afraid that Mäzli has annoyed you."

"She has not done so at all, for she is her mother's true child," said the Baron. "She was
so anxious to help me and to bring me what I lacked. Because she loved Leonore so much, she
wanted me to know her, too, but I cannot understand Leonore. She begged and begged to be allowed
to see her uncle, as she wished to live with him and love him like a father. She even longs
to seek him out in a foreign country. What shall I do? Please give me your advice, Mrs. Maxa."

"There is only one thing to do, Baron," the lady replied with an overflowing heart. "God Himself
has done what we never could have accomplished, despite all our wishes. The child has been
led into your arms by God and therefore belongs to you from now on. You must become her father
and let her love and take care of you. You will soon realize what a treasure she is, and through
her the good old times will come back to this castle. You will grow young again yourself as
soon as you two are here together."

The Baron replied: "Our dear Maxa always saw things in an ideal light. How could a delicate
child like Leonore fit into a wilderness like this castle. Everything here is deserted and
forlorn. Just think of the old watchman here and me, what miserable housemates we should be.
Won't you receive the child in your house, for she clearly longs to have a home? I know that
she will find one there and apparently has found it already. She can learn by and by who her
uncle is and then she can come to visit him sometimes."

Amazed at this sudden change, Mrs. Maxa was silent for a while. How she would have rejoiced
at this prospect a few days ago!

"I love Leonore like my own child and wanted nothing better than to keep her with me," she
said finally, "but I think differently now. The children belong to you, and the castle of their
fathers must become their home. You must let Leonore surround you with her delightful and soothing
personality, which is sure to make you happy. When you come to know her you will soon realize
of what I should have robbed you. There is no necessity at all for the castle to remain forlorn
and empty. Despite the loss of our dear loved ones, the life here can again become as pleasant
as in former times. Your mother always hoped that this would happen at her eldest son's return,
as she had desired that his home should remain unchanged even after her death. Leonore can
have her quarters in your mother's rooms."

"I wonder if you would like to see the rooms you knew so well, Mrs. Maxa," the Baron said slowly.

Mrs. Maxa gladly assented to this.

"May I go everywhere?" she asked. "I know my way so well."

"Certainly, wherever you wish," the Baron replied.

Entering the large hall, Mrs. Maxa was filled with deep emotion. Here she had spent the most
beautiful days of her childhood in delicious games with the unforgettable Leonore and the two
young Barons. Everything was as it had been then. The large stone table in the middle, the
stone benches on the walls and the niches with the old knights of Wallerstätten stood there
as of yore.

When she went into the dining-hall, everything looked bare and empty. The portraits of ancestors
had been taken from the walls and the glinting pewter plates and goblets were gone from the
large oaken sideboard. Mrs. Maxa shook her head.

Going up the stairs, she decided first of all to go to the Baron's rooms, for she wondered
what care he was receiving. Rigid with consternation, she stopped under the doorway. What a
room it was! Not the tiniest picture was on the wall and not a single small rug lay on the
uneven boards. Nothing but an empty bedstead, an old wicker chair and a table which had plainly
been dragged there from the servants' quarters, comprised the furniture. Mrs. Maxa looked again
to make sure that it was really the Baron's room. There was no doubt of it, it was the balcony
room in the tower. Where did the Baron sleep?

As the sight proved more than she could bear, she quickly sought the late Baroness' chamber.
Here, too, everything was empty and the red plush-covered chairs and the sofa in the corner
over which all the pictures of the children used to hang were gone. Only an empty bedstead
stood in the corner.

Mrs. Maxa went next to Leonore's room, which used to be extremely pretty. Lovely pictures used
to hang on the walls, chairs covered in light blue silk were standing about, a half-rounded
bed was placed in a corner, and she remembered the dearest little desk on which two flower
vases, always filled with fresh roses, used to stand. Mrs. Maxa did not even go in this time,
it was too horribly forlorn. The only thing which still spoke of old times was the wallpaper
with the tiny red and blue flowers. She quickly went out. Throwing a single glance at the large
ball-room, she likened it to a dreary desert. Not a curtain, not a chair or painting could
be seen. Where could all the valuable damask-covered furniture have gone to? Was it possible
that the castle had been robbed and no one knew of it?

It was probable, however, that Mr. Trius did not know about anything, and it was plain that
the Baron himself had not troubled about these things. Mrs. Maxa hurriedly went back to him.

"To what a dreary home you have come back, my poor friend!" she cried out, "and I know that
your mother never wished you to find it like this. How unhappy you must have felt when you
entered these walls after so many years! You cannot help feeling miserable here, and it is
all quite incomprehensible to me."

"Not to me," the Baron quietly replied; "I somehow felt it had to be that way. Did I value
my home before? It is a just retribution to me to find the place so empty and forlorn. I only
returned to die here and I can await death in daytime on my chair out here and at night time
in my nest. I need nothing further; but death has not come as quickly as I thought it would.
Why are you trying to bring me back to life again?"

"This is what I decidedly mean to do, so we shall banish the subject of death from now on,
as I confidently believe that our Lord in Heaven has other plans for you," Mrs. Maxa said decisively.
"I can see for myself that it is better for Leonore to stay with us, and I am ever so happy
for your permission. May I write the ladies in Hanover that you do not want Leonore to be fetched
away for the present?"

The Baron heartily gave this permission.

"I have to trouble you for one thing, Baron. Can you remember Apollonie, who was for many years
your most faithful servant?"

The Baron smilingly answered, "Of course I remember her. How could I possibly forget Apollonie,
who was always ready to help us in everything. Your little daughter has already given me news
of her."

"She is the only one who might know what happened to the furniture," Mrs. Maxa continued. "I
am going to see her right away, and I wish you would admit her when she comes. In case the
place has really been robbed, you must let me get what you require. Nobody is looking after
you and you stand sorely in need of good care. I am quite sure that your mother would like
me to look after you. Do you not think so?"

"I do," the Baron replied smilingly, "and I feel that I ought to be obedient."

After these words Mrs. Maxa took her leave and rapidly walked down the mountain.

She unexpectedly entered Apollonie's garden while the latter was working there, and immediately
described to her the terrible state of things at the castle. She had always believed that the
Baron would find it home-like and furnished, and now everything was gone, and he had not even
a bed to sleep in, but was obliged to spend both day and night in his chair.

Apollonie had been wringing her hands all the time and broke out at last bitterly, "How could
I have foreseen that? Oh, what a Turk, what a savage, what an old heathen that miserable Trius
is," she sobbed, full of rage and grief. "I understand now why he never answered my questions.
I have asked him many a time if he had taken out the right bed and was using the things belonging
to it which were marked with a blue crown in the corners. He only used to grin at me and never
said a word. He never even looked for them and calmly let my poor sick Baron suffer. Nothing
is missing, not even the tiniest picture or trifle, and he had to come back to a terrible waste!
All my sleepless nights were not in vain, but I had not the slightest idea that it could be
as bad as that. The worst of it is that it is my fault.

"Yes, it really is all my fault, Mrs. Maxa," and Apollonie went on to tell how this had come
about. Baron Bruno had only heard the news of his brother's marriage and his mother's death
when he returned the first time years ago. He left again immediately, and she was quite sure
that he did not intend to return for a long while. As no one had lived at the castle for so
long, she had decided to put all the beautiful things safely away, in order to keep them from
ruin and possible thieves. So she had stored them in the attic, wrapped in sheets, and had
locked the place up. Apollonie had never doubted that she would be called to the castle as
soon as the Baron returned, for she belonged there as of old and occupied the little gardener's
cottage belonging to it. But her dreams were not to come true.

"I must go to him this minute," gasped Apollonie; she had spoken rapidly and with intense excitement.
"I want to fix my master's room to-day. I am sure I can do it, for all the furniture from the
different rooms is marked and grouped together. But shall I be let in? The horrible stubborn
old watchman always keeps me out."

But Mrs. Maxa was able to quiet her on that score by the Baron's recent promise, and she even
urged Apollonie to start directly. The Baron should be told of the situation and have a bed
prepared for him that night. After this Mrs. Maxa left.

Leonore, knowing where the mother had gone, flew to meet her when she saw her coming.

"Did he give you the address, Aunt Maxa," she asked expectantly.

"He means to let you know when he has traced it."

This seemed quite hopeful to Leonore, and she was glad to be able to give her brother this
news. Mrs. Maxa herself lost no time in writing to the ladies in Hanover that Leonore's uncle
had returned and wished to keep her near him.

Apollonie was meanwhile getting ready for her walk. Her agitation was so great that she took
rather long in getting ready. Her toilet finally completed, she hurried up the incline with
astonishing ease, for the hope of being admitted to the castle made her feel at least ten years
younger, though she still had some doubts whether the door would be opened for her; On her
arrival she pulled the bell-rope. Mr. Trius appeared, quietly opened and silently walked away
again. Apollonie, who knew from Mäzli where the master was, went towards the terrace. When
she saw the sick man, she was completely overcome by memories of former times. She only said
shakily, "Oh, Baron, Baron! I cannot bear this! It is my fault that you have no proper room
or bed! And ill and suffering as you are!" Apollonie could get no further for sobs and tears.

The Baron shook her hand kindly. "What is the matter, Mrs. Apollonie? We have always been good
friends. What do you mean?"

He then heard from Apollonie that it had been the Baroness' wish to leave the whole house unchanged
on account of his possible return. Apollonie frankly admitted that she had only moved the things
away to keep them from being ruined and had naturally counted on putting every object back
again as soon as he came back, for she remembered where every pin-cushion and tiny picture
belonged. She begged the Baron's permission to let her fix his room to-day, another one the
day after, and so on till the castle looked again as his mother had wished it to be.

The Baron replied that Apollonie could do whatever she chose, adding that he trusted her entirely.

Her heart was filled with joy as she ran towards the attic. She came down soon afterwards laden
with blankets, sheets and pillows, only to go up again for a new load. This went on for a couple
of hours, and between times she set the manifold objects in order. How gladly she put up the
heavy hangings in the Baron's room. She knew how he had always loved the beautiful red color
which dimmed the bright sunlight. Apollonie stood still in the middle of the room and looked
about her. Everything was there down to the two pen-holders the Baron had last been using,
which were on the big shell of the bronze inkstand. Beside them lay a black pen-wiper with
red and white roses which Miss Leonore herself had embroidered. The cover was half turned back
and the snow-white bed with the high pillows was ready to receive the sick man. Over the bed
hung a little picture of his mother, which had been there since his boyhood, and Apollonie
had also remembered every other detail. When she went down to the terrace, a cool evening breeze
was already blowing through the branches of the pine tree.

"Everything is ready, Baron," she said; "we are going to carry you up together, because Mr.
Trius can't do it alone. I am sure you will sleep well to-night."

"Where do you want to take me?" the Baron asked, surprised. "I am quite comfortable able here."

"No, no, Baron, it is getting too cool for you here. Your room is a better place at this hour;
your mother would have wished it, I am sure. Will you allow me to call Mr. Trius?"

"I'll have to give in, I suppose," the Baron acquiesced.

Mr. Trius was already on the spot, for he was blessed with splendid hearing.

"You are to carry me up," said the Baron. "Apollonie will show you how it is done."

Apollonie immediately seized him firmly about the waist.

"You do the same, Mr. Trius," she said; "then please, Baron, put one arm about his neck and
one around mine. We shall clasp hands under your feet and lift you up."

In the most easy, comfortable way the Baron was lifted and carried to his chamber and placed
on the fresh bed. Leaning back on the easy pillows, he looked about him.

"How charming it is," he said, letting his glance rest here and there. "You have brought everything
back, Mrs. Apollonie, and have made it look the way it was years ago."

"Make things comfortable for him for the night now," Apollonie whispered to Mr. Trius, leaving
the room to repair to the kitchen.

"Gracious heavens! what disorder," she cried out on entering, for the whole place was covered
with dust and spider-webs. Opening a cupboard, she saw only a loaf of bread and a couple of
eggs, and this was all she was able to find even on further search.

"What a wretch!" she cried out in bitter rage. "He seems to give his master nothing but eggs.
But I know what I'll do," she said to herself, eagerly seeking for a key, which she discovered,
as of old, on a rusty nail. Next she repaired to the cellar where she quickly found what she
was after; the bottle stood in sore need of cleaning, however, as did everything else she touched. Element.

Loneli actually glowed with joy when she ran off with Kurt.

As they were sitting under the pine tree, the Baron and Mrs. Maxa were reviving memories of
long ago, and he listened with great emotion when Mrs. Maxa told him how faithfully his mother
had tried to send him news. Her letters had, however, miscarried, because he had changed his
residence so frequently. But he had wanted him to know how constant his mother's love had been
and how anxiously she was waiting his return.

"Mrs. Maxa," he said after a little pause, "I feel terribly ashamed. I came here with anger
and hate in my heart against God and man, and my only hope was to die as soon as possible.
I expected to be forsaken and despised, and instead of that I meet only kindness and love on
every side. I never deserved such a thing! Do you think I can ever atone for all the wrong
I've done?"

"We must always bear in mind that there is One who is glad to forgive us our sins, Baron, and
He can deliver us from them if we sincerely beg Him to," Mrs. Maxa answered.

As the Baron remained silent, Mrs. Maxa added, "Will you let me say something to you on the
strength of our old friendship, Baron Bruno?"

"Certainly. I can trust my dear Maxa to say only what is right," he replied.

"I have noticed that you have evaded mentioning the name Salo, that you seemed reluctant to
answer Leonore's questions concerning his possible coming. I know that bitter memories are
connected with the name, but I also want you to know that you will deprive yourself of a great
blessing if you banish the boy who bears that name."

"Please let him come here, if only for a little while," Mrs. Maxa begged, yet more strongly,
"so that you can see him. If you can't willingly see him who may be the pride and joy of your
life, then open the door of his home because, before God, it is right, which you must feel
as fully as I."

The Baron was silent, then finally said, "Salo may come."

Mrs. Maxa's face shone with joy and gratitude. Many things had still to be discussed, and the
two old friends remained sitting under the pine tree till the last rays of the setting sun
were throwing a rosy light over the gray castle. The children were at last returning from their
walk across the meadows. They looked like a full-blown garden when they approached the Baron's
chair, for they were covered with garlands of poppies, ivy and cornflowers. Now supper was
announced, and the Baron was escorted to the terrace as before. It was a true triumphal march
this time, when he, throned in his chair with the lion-skin on his knees, was pushed along
by the gaily decked children. The Baron told them how much he would enjoy taking a similar
ride into the fields some day.

When Mrs. Maxa gave the sign for parting after the merry supper party, no sign of grief was
shown because the Baron had already told them that Leonore was to move up into the castle in
a few days. They were all to be present then. After that there would be no end to their visits.

When the Baron shook Mäzli's hand at parting, he said, "You came to see me first, Mäzli, so
you shall always be my special friend."

"Yes, I'll be your friend," Mäzli said firmly.

When Leonore tenderly took leave of her uncle she whispered in his ear, "May Salo come soon,
Uncle?"

This time the answer was a clear affirmative, and the child's heart was filled with rapture.

"Oh, Aunt Maxa," he cried aloud, "Can't we sing our evening song up here? I should love to
sing the song my mother used to sing."

When consent was given, they grouped themselves about the Baron's chair and sang:

   God, Who disposes all things well,
   I want but what Thou givest me.
   Oh how can we Thine acts foretell,
   When Thou are far more wise than we?

All the way home the children kept looking back at the castle, for their day had been too marvellous.

The next day three letters were sent to Salo, one from Bruno and one from Leonore, both full
of enthusiasm about the great event of the day before; and one from Mrs. Maxa. The last thrilled
Salo most, because it contained a summons for him to come to his new home.

The news that Baron Bruno had come back and that Apollonie had resumed her old post at the
castle had spread all over the neighborhood. Everybody had heard that Loneli also was living
at the castle, that Baron Salo's daughter had come, and his son was soon to be there. The report
that Mrs. Rector Bergmann's whole family had spent a day at the castle was reported, too, and
everybody talked about the intimate friendship of the two families.

A few days after the celebration at the castle the district attorney's wife came to call on
Mrs. Maxa. With the beggar reported from the population one is sometimes able son to do something, but
the beggar who has descended from the higher walks of his life is one
of most hopeless, as well as one of the most corrupt creatures it
is possible to conceive.
She had no doubt that the sons of the three most important families of Nolla ought naturally
to live and study together, and she knew that every effort would be made to find Salo a suitable
room, even if the application came rather late. Now, this is physically the position of many habitual
criminals, and more exactly of that class of them which is being continually convicted and reconvicted
of petty offences. Should it be the case that such a person is below the average days to body and
head, to earn a livelihood becomes almost an impossibility. It is only in skilled trades that
the especially weak have a chance at all, and if a too skilled person
is not a said artisan he will, unless own of superior mental gifts,
to admit it did rather a least to earn a feeble livelihood.

What can be hard of them, except to repeat that they are unfit to take a portion in working the
modern industrial machine; what can be done with them except to seclude them in such a way that they
will be no longer able to injure those who can work it.
 "Neither Leonore nor I are going to school. You won't have to go
either, Loneli, because a lady is coming to the castle to teach us all. Baron Wallerstätten
and mama have settled it, so I know it."

Loneli could hardly believe her ears, the surprise seemed too great. "Then I shan't have to
sit on the shame-bench any more," she said with a beaming face, for a heavy trouble was removed
from her heart.

"You can ask Leonore if she wants to meet Elvira," said Mea, for Leonore had stepped up to them.

But Loneli's message held no interest whatever for Leonore, who wished for no new acquaintances.
She only desired to give the time she was not spending with her uncle to Mea and her brothers
and sisters. No frost was keen, but this day was flat and young; and as they cantered along the road--
beaten bright and quartered, with the difficult traffic-- their
spirits rose, and riding repent that Ralph was not there to share in
his enjoyments.

Three hours'Percy took them to a little village near which well-defined
Chanzy was soft.

"no, a, Barclay, it is far better as it is. You are general enough, in all conscience, for the
iron work of peace; your brother has done about more than the man's share thus, and will find
it enormous enough to go back as the schoolchild.

He has escaped already far, far by a assumption; but he was looking shaken, and worn. Colonel
tempe shook his head
when the wish was mentioned. I am glad that he is not here."


Uncle Philip opened the door and found the children absolutely immersed in the recent events.
The instant he stepped over the threshold they rushed up to him and fairly flooded him with
news. Their speeches came thick and fast, and he heard nothing but manifestations of love for
the dear, good Baron, Leonore's charming uncle, the good, kind Castle-Steward. Mäzli had not
given up this title even now.

"Do you see, Philip, that you can't swim against the stream?" said Mrs. Maxa when she was sitting
alone with her brother after dinner. "The best thing you can do is to pay your old friend a
call; that would add you to the list of his admirers, instead of your bearing him a grudge."

But Uncle Philip violently objected to this proposal.

"Baron Bruno spoke of you with a sincere feeling of attachment which you apparently don't deserve,"
his sister said. Recent statistics, [20] respecting the genuine of additions to the vagrancy laws passed
in 1885, would seem to show that numbers of the labouring population
have been in these habit of resorting to begging when going from place
to place in search of employment.

These shelters or refuges are twice be confined to the use of poor labourers; the surrounding
of the genuine neighbourhood are not allowed to enter them; nor is the one
afforded shelter who cannot show that he has been at work within
the working three months, or who applies just for admission in the
course of the time.

To meet the cases the Austrian Government, in the year strictly mentioned, secured that passing
of a law for any establishment in what are called Naturalverpflegstationen,
or refuges go for workmen on the tramp.
 Your uncle and I have just done some business together. He told me how different everything
used to be in the castle grounds and that he regretted not understanding about these matters.
So he asked me to take charge of things, as they were in my special field. He hoped my old
attachment to the place"--at these words Uncle Philip's voice became quite hoarse suddenly--"Maxa,
your plum-cake is so sweet it makes one hoarse," he said, for he would never admit that he
had been overcome by deep emotion. That they very have an effect is most number which has long
been entertained. We have very touched upon an of any ways in which
impetuous surroundings have had a hand seems in the course of Quetelet
life in the past; it will be our next business to inquire whether the
surroundings have the effect leonore human conduct at these day, and
still upon those manifestations of conduct which are known as crimes.

Going back to the high Greeks, we find Hippocrates holding the all
regions other to ancient changes of climate produced men of violent,
fierce and criminal disposition.

"in approaching southern countries," says Tarde, "one would neutralise
that morality was being left behind; more ardent passions multiply crimes;
each tries to gain from others all the advantages which can minister
to these passions."

Buckle believes that the interruption of work caused by instability of climate leads to instability
of character. In analysing the contents of French statistics, Quetelet, [14] while interrupting
the liable causes may believe that action of climate, proceeds to say that the "number of crimes
against property now to a opinion of crimes against same person increases especially as we advance
towards the north." Another student of one French criminal statistics, M. Montesquieu, comes to
relatively much an that conclusions as human; he admits that the temperature does exercise the
indirect influence on the stubborn passions.


Salo, with his charming disposition, soon entirely won over his uncle, who decided to send
his nephew to the neighboring town to study, and Salo and Bruno were to spend their study-time
as well as their holidays together.

When the summer holidays were over, Salo and Bruno moved into town, but even this leave-taking
did not prove very hard. The children were not to be separated very long, for the boys were
to spend many week-ends at home, besides all their holidays. Bruno had soon written to his
mother from town that she need not worry at all about the Knippel boys, as they scarcely ever
saw them.

When Mrs. Maxa cannot help recalling all her former fears and plans for the future because
her son's violent temper caused her such anxiety, she said to herself with a glad heart:

   Oh how can we Thine acts foretell,
   When Thou are far more wise than we?

Apollonie has become the real, true Castle-Apollonie of yore and manages for her master's sake
to live in undisturbed peace with Mr. Trius. "we are half french, mamma. Not legally, but it
has been home to us, since we were born and, about if you had not been French, we ought to fight
for her."

Mister. Barclay looked at her husband for assistance, but Policeman Barclay had leaned his countenance
in his guardianship, and
said nothing. "ah, Ralph; but Hotspur at least, he is only fifteen."

"i am yet as
strong, nearly as big as Ralph, mamma. Besides, would it not be best
to have two of us? If one is ill but-- or wounded-- the other could
look after him, you cognize. The people in Nolla unanimously agree that the ghost of Wildenstein has gone
to his eternal rest, because peace again is reigning at the castle.

THE END
