THE EPISODE OF THE MEXICAN SEER

My name is Seymour Wilbraham Wentworth. I am brother-in-law and secretary to Sir Charles Vandrift,
the South African millionaire and famous financier. Many years ago, when Charlie Vandrift was
a small lawyer in Cape Town, I had the (qualified) good fortune to marry his sister. Much later,
when the Vandrift estate and farm near Kimberley developed by degrees into the Cloetedorp Golcondas,
Limited, my brother-in-law offered me the not unremunerative post of secretary; in which capacity
I have ever since been his constant and attached companion.

He is not a man whom any common sharper can take in, is Charles Vandrift. Middle height, square
build, firm mouth, keen eyes--the very picture of a sharp and successful business genius. I
have only known one rogue impose upon Sir Charles, and that one rogue, as the Commissary of
Police at Nice remarked, would doubtless have imposed upon a syndicate of Vidocq, Robert Houdin,
and Cagliostro.

We had run across to the Riviera for a few weeks in the season. Our object being strictly rest
and recreation from the arduous duties of financial combination, we did not think it necessary
to take our wives out with us. Indeed, Lady Vandrift is absolutely wedded to the joys of London,
and does not appreciate the rural delights of the Mediterranean littoral. But Sir Charles and
I, though immersed in affairs when at home, both thoroughly enjoy the complete change from
the City to the charming vegetation and pellucid air on the terrace at Monte Carlo. We are
so fond of scenery. That delicious view over the rocks of Monaco, with the Maritime Alps in
the rear, and the blue sea in front, not to mention the imposing Casino in the foreground,
appeals to me as one of the most beautiful prospects in all Europe. Sir Charles has a sentimental
attachment for the place. He finds it restores and freshens him, after the turmoil of London,
to win a few hundreds at roulette in the course of an afternoon among the palms and cactuses
and pure breezes of Monte Carlo. The country, say I, for a jaded intellect! However, we never
on any account actually stop in the Principality itself. Sir Charles thinks Monte Carlo is
not a sound address for a financier's letters. He prefers a comfortable hotel on the Promenade
des Anglais at Nice, where he recovers health and renovates his nervous system by taking daily
excursions along the coast to the Casino.

This particular season we were snugly ensconced at the Hôtel des Anglais. We had capital quarters
on the first floor--salon, study, and bedrooms--and found on the spot a most agreeable cosmopolitan
society. All Nice, just then, was ringing with talk about a curious impostor, known to his
followers as the Great Mexican Seer, and supposed to be gifted with second sight, as well as
with endless other supernatural powers. Now, it is a peculiarity of my able brother-in-law's
that, when he meets with a quack, he burns to expose him; he is so keen a man of business himself
that it gives him, so to speak, a disinterested pleasure to unmask and detect imposture in
others. Many ladies at the hotel, some of whom had met and conversed with the Mexican Seer,
were constantly telling us strange stories of his doings. He had disclosed to one the present
whereabouts of a runaway husband; he had pointed out to another the numbers that would win
at roulette next evening; he had shown a third the image on a screen of the man she had for
years adored without his knowledge. Of course, Sir Charles didn't believe a word of it; but
his curiosity was roused; he wished to see and judge for himself of the wonderful thought-reader.

"What would be his terms, do you think, for a private séance?" he asked of Madame Picardet,
the lady to whom the Seer had successfully predicted the winning numbers.

"He does not work for money," Madame Picardet answered, "but for the good of humanity. I'm
sure he would gladly come and exhibit for nothing his miraculous faculties."

"Nonsense!" Sir Charles answered. "The man must live. I'd pay him five guineas, though, to
see him alone. What hotel is he stopping at?"

"The Cosmopolitan, I think," the lady answered. "Oh no; I remember now, the Westminster."

Sir Charles turned to me quietly. "Look here, Seymour," he whispered. "Go round to this fellow's
place immediately after dinner, and offer him five pounds to give a private séance at once
in my rooms, without mentioning who I am to him; keep the name quite quiet. Bring him back
with you, too, and come straight upstairs with him, so that there may be no collusion. We'll
see just how much the fellow can tell us."

I went as directed. I found the Seer a very remarkable and interesting person. He stood about
Sir Charles's own height, but was slimmer and straighter, with an aquiline nose, strangely
piercing eyes, very large black pupils, and a finely-chiselled close-shaven face, like the
bust of Antinous in our hall in Mayfair. What gave him his most characteristic touch, however,
was his odd head of hair, curly and wavy like Paderewski's, standing out in a halo round his
high white forehead and his delicate profile. I could see at a glance why he succeeded so well
in impressing women; he had the look of a poet, a singer, a prophet.

"I have come round," I said, "to ask whether you will consent to give a séance at once in a
friend's rooms; and my principal wishes me to add that he is prepared to pay five pounds as
the price of the entertainment."

Señor Antonio Herrera--that was what he called himself--bowed to me with impressive Spanish
politeness. His dusky olive cheeks were wrinkled with a smile of gentle contempt as he answered
gravely--

"I do not sell my gifts; I bestow them freely. If your friend--your anonymous friend--desires
to behold the cosmic wonders that are wrought through my hands, I am glad to show them to him.
Fortunately, as often happens when it is necessary to convince and confound a sceptic (for
that your friend is a sceptic I feel instinctively), I chance to have no engagements at all
this evening." He ran his hand through his fine, long hair reflectively. "Yes, I go," he continued,
as if addressing some unknown presence that hovered about the ceiling; "I go; come with me!"
Then he put on his broad sombrero, with its crimson ribbon, wrapped a cloak round his shoulders,
lighted a cigarette, and strode forth by my side towards the Hôtel des Anglais.

He talked little by the way, and that little in curt sentences. He seemed buried in deep thought;
indeed, when we reached the door and I turned in, he walked a step or two farther on, as if
not noticing to what place I had brought him. Then he drew himself up short, and gazed around
him for a moment. "Ha, the Anglais," he said--and I may mention in passing that his English,
in spite of a slight southern accent, was idiomatic and excellent. "It is here, then; it is
here!" He was addressing once more the unseen presence.

I smiled to think that these childish devices were intended to deceive Sir Charles Vandrift.
Not quite the sort of man (as the City of London knows) to be taken in by hocus-pocus. And
all this, I saw, was the cheapest and most commonplace conjurer's patter.

We went upstairs to our rooms. Charles had gathered together a few friends to watch the performance.
The Seer entered, wrapt in thought. He was in evening dress, but a red sash round his waist
gave a touch of picturesqueness and a dash of colour. He paused for a moment in the middle
of the salon, without letting his eyes rest on anybody or anything. Then he walked straight
up to Charles, and held out his dark hand.

"Good-evening," he said. "You are the host. My soul's sight tells me so."

"Good shot," Sir Charles answered. "These fellows have to be quick-witted, you know, Mrs. Mackenzie,
or they'd never get on at it."

The Seer gazed about him, and smiled blankly at a person or two whose faces he seemed to recognise
from a previous existence. Then Charles began to ask him a few simple questions, not about
himself, but about me, just to test him. He answered most of them with surprising correctness.
"His name? His name begins with an S I think:--You call him Seymour." He paused long between
each clause, as if the facts were revealed to him slowly. "Seymour--Wilbraham--Earl of Strafford.
No, not Earl of Strafford! Seymour Wilbraham Wentworth. There seems to be some connection in
somebody's mind now present between Wentworth and Strafford. I am not English. I do not know
what it means. But they are somehow the same name, Wentworth and Strafford."

He gazed around, apparently for confirmation. A lady came to his rescue.

"Wentworth was the surname of the great Earl of Strafford," she murmured gently; "and I was
wondering, as you spoke, whether Mr. Wentworth might possibly be descended from him."

"He is," the Seer replied instantly, with a flash of those dark eyes. And I thought this curious;
for though my father always maintained the reality of the relationship, there was one link
wanting to complete the pedigree. He could not make sure that the Hon. Thomas Wilbraham Wentworth
was the father of Jonathan Wentworth, the Bristol horse-dealer, from whom we are descended.

"Where was I born?" Sir Charles interrupted, coming suddenly to his own case.

The Seer clapped his two hands to his forehead and held it between them, as if to prevent it
from bursting. "Africa," he said slowly, as the facts narrowed down, so to speak. "South Africa;
Cape of Good Hope; Jansenville; De Witt Street. 1840."

"By Jove, he's correct," Sir Charles muttered. "He seems really to do it. Still, he may have
found me out. He may have known where he was coming."

"I never gave a hint," I answered; "till he reached the door, he didn't even know to what hotel
I was piloting him."

The Seer stroked his chin softly. His eye appeared to me to have a furtive gleam in it. "Would
you like me to tell you the number of a bank-note inclosed in an envelope?" he asked casually.

"Go out of the room," Sir Charles said, "while I pass it round the company."

Señor Herrera disappeared. Sir Charles passed it round cautiously, holding it all the time
in his own hand, but letting his guests see the number. Then he placed it in an envelope and
gummed it down firmly.

The Seer returned. His keen eyes swept the company with a comprehensive glance. He shook his
shaggy mane. Then he took the envelope in his hands and gazed at it fixedly. "AF, 73549," he
answered, in a slow tone. "A Bank of England note for fifty pounds--exchanged at the Casino
for gold won yesterday at Monte Carlo."

"I see how he did that," Sir Charles said triumphantly. "He must have changed it there himself;
and then I changed it back again. In point of fact, I remember seeing a fellow with long hair
loafing about. Still, it's capital conjuring."

"He can see through matter," one of the ladies interposed. It was Madame Picardet. "He can
see through a box." She drew a little gold vinaigrette, such as our grandmothers used, from
her dress-pocket. "What is in this?" she inquired, holding it up to him.

Señor Herrera gazed through it. "Three gold coins," he replied, knitting his brows with the
effort of seeing into the box: "one, an American five dollars; one, a French ten-franc piece;
one, twenty marks, German, of the old Emperor William."

She opened the box and passed it round. Sir Charles smiled a quiet smile.

"Confederacy!" he muttered, half to himself. "Confederacy!"

The Seer turned to him with a sullen air. "You want a better sign?" he said, in a very impressive
voice. "A sign that will convince you! Very well: you have a letter in your left waistcoat
pocket--a crumpled-up letter. Do you wish me to read it out? I will, if you desire it."

It may seem to those who know Sir Charles incredible, but, I am bound to admit, my brother-in-law
coloured. What that letter contained I cannot say; he only answered, very testily and evasively,
"No, thank you; I won't trouble you. The exhibition you have already given us of your skill
in this kind more than amply suffices." And his fingers strayed nervously to his waistcoat
pocket, as if he was half afraid, even then, Señor Herrera would read it.

I fancied, too, he glanced somewhat anxiously towards Madame Picardet.

The Seer bowed courteously. "Your will, señor, is law," he said. "I make it a principle, though
I can see through all things, invariably to respect the secrecies and sanctities. If it were
not so, I might dissolve society. For which of us is there who could bear the whole truth being
told about him?" He gazed around the room. An unpleasant thrill supervened. Most of us felt
this uncanny Spanish American knew really too much. And some of us were engaged in financial
operations.

"For example," the Seer continued blandly, "I happened a few weeks ago to travel down here
from Paris by train with a very intelligent man, a company promoter. He had in his bag some
documents--some confidential documents:" he glanced at Sir Charles. "You know the kind of thing,
my dear sir: reports from experts--from mining engineers. You may have seen some such; marked
strictly private."

"They form an element in high finance," Sir Charles admitted coldly.

"Pre-cisely," the Seer murmured, his accent for a moment less Spanish than before. "And, as
they were marked strictly private, I respect, of course, the seal of confidence. That's all
I wish to say. I hold it a duty, being intrusted with such powers, not to use them in a manner
which may annoy or incommode my fellow-creatures."

"Your feeling does you honour," Sir Charles answered, with some acerbity. Then he whispered
in my ear: "Confounded clever scoundrel, Sey; rather wish we hadn't brought him here."

Señor Herrera seemed intuitively to divine this wish, for he interposed, in a lighter and gayer
tone--

"I will now show you a different and more interesting embodiment of occult power, for which
we shall need a somewhat subdued arrangement of surrounding lights. Would you mind, señor host--for
I have purposely abstained from reading your name on the brain of any one present--would you
mind my turning down this lamp just a little? ... So! That will do. Now, this one; and this
one. Exactly! that's right." He poured a few grains of powder out of a packet into a saucer.
"Next, a match, if you please. Thank you!" It burnt with a strange green light. He drew from
his pocket a card, and produced a little ink-bottle. "Have you a pen?" he asked.

I instantly brought one. He handed it to Sir Charles. "Oblige me," he said, "by writing your
name there." And he indicated a place in the centre of the card, which had an embossed edge,
with a small middle square of a different colour.

Sir Charles has a natural disinclination to signing his name without knowing why. "What do
you want with it?" he asked. (A millionaire's signature has so many uses.)

"I want you to put the card in an envelope," the Seer replied, "and then to burn it. After
that, I shall show you your own name written in letters of blood on my arm, in your own handwriting."

Sir Charles took the pen. If the signature was to be burned as soon as finished, he didn't
mind giving it. He wrote his name in his usual firm clear style--the writing of a man who knows
his worth and is not afraid of drawing a cheque for five thousand.

"Look at it long," the Seer said, from the other side of the room. He had not watched him write it.

Sir Charles stared at it fixedly. The Seer was really beginning to produce an impression.

"Now, put it in that envelope," the Seer exclaimed.

Sir Charles, like a lamb, placed it as directed.

The Seer strode forward. "Give me the envelope," he said. He took it in his hand, walked over
towards the fireplace, and solemnly burnt it. "See--it crumbles into ashes," he cried. Then
he came back to the middle of the room, close to the green light, rolled up his sleeve, and
held his arm before Sir Charles. There, in blood-red letters, my brother-in-law read the name,
"Charles Vandrift," in his own handwriting!

"I see how that's done," Sir Charles murmured, drawing back. "It's a clever delusion; but still,
I see through it. It's like that ghost-book. Your ink was deep green; your light was green;
you made me look at it long; and then I saw the same thing written on the skin of your arm
in complementary colours."

"You think so?" the Seer replied, with a curious curl of the lip.

"I'm sure of it," Sir Charles answered.

Quick as lightning the Seer again rolled up his sleeve. "That's your name," he cried, in a
very clear voice, "but not your whole name. What do you say, then, to my right? Is this one
also a complementary colour?" He held his other arm out. There, in sea-green letters, I read
the name, "Charles O'Sullivan Vandrift." It is my brother-in-law's full baptismal designation;
but he has dropped the O'Sullivan for many years past, and, to say the truth, doesn't like
it. He is a little bit ashamed of his mother's family.

Charles glanced at it hurriedly. "Quite right," he said, "quite right!" But his voice was hollow.
I could guess he didn't care to continue the séance. He could see through the man, of course;
but it was clear the fellow knew too much about us to be entirely pleasant.

"Turn up the lights," I said, and a servant turned them. "Shall I say coffee and benedictine?"
I whispered to Vandrift.

"By all means," he answered. "Anything to keep this fellow from further impertinences! And,
I say, don't you think you'd better suggest at the same time that the men should smoke? Even
these ladies are not above a cigarette--some of them."

There was a sigh of relief. The lights burned brightly. The Seer for the moment retired from
business, so to speak. He accepted a partaga with a very good grace, sipped his coffee in a
corner, and chatted to the lady who had suggested Strafford with marked politeness. He was
a polished gentleman.

Next morning, in the hall of the hotel, I saw Madame Picardet again, in a neat tailor-made
travelling dress, evidently bound for the railway-station.

"What, off, Madame Picardet?" I cried.

She smiled, and held out her prettily-gloved hand. "Yes, I'm off," she answered archly. "Florence,
or Rome, or somewhere. I've drained Nice dry--like a sucked orange. Got all the fun I can out
of it. Now I'm away again to my beloved Italy."

But it struck me as odd that, if Italy was her game, she went by the omnibus which takes down
to the train de luxe for Paris. However, a man of the world accepts what a lady tells him,
no matter how improbable; and I confess, for ten days or so, I thought no more about her, or
the Seer either.

At the end of that time our fortnightly pass-book came in from the bank in London. It is part
of my duty, as the millionaire's secretary, to make up this book once a fortnight, and to compare
the cancelled cheques with Sir Charles's counterfoils. On this particular occasion I happened
to observe what I can only describe as a very grave discrepancy,--in fact, a discrepancy of
5000 pounds. On the wrong side, too. Sir Charles was debited with 5000 pounds more than the
total amount that was shown on the counterfoils.

I examined the book with care. The source of the error was obvious. It lay in a cheque to Self
or Bearer, for 5000 pounds, signed by Sir Charles, and evidently paid across the counter in
London, as it bore on its face no stamp or indication of any other office.

I called in my brother-in-law from the salon to the study. "Look here, Charles," I said, "there's
a cheque in the book which you haven't entered." And I handed it to him without comment, for
I thought it might have been drawn to settle some little loss on the turf or at cards, or to
make up some other affair he didn't desire to mention to me. These things will happen.

He looked at it and stared hard. Then he pursed up his mouth and gave a long low "Whew!" At
last he turned it over and remarked, "I say, Sey, my boy, we've just been done jolly well brown,
haven't we?"

I glanced at the cheque. "How do you mean?" I inquired.

"Why, the Seer," he replied, still staring at it ruefully. "I don't mind the five thou., but
to think the fellow should have gammoned the pair of us like that--ignominious, I call it!"

"How do you know it's the Seer?" I asked.

"Look at the green ink," he answered. "Besides, I recollect the very shape of the last flourish.
I flourished a bit like that in the excitement of the moment, which I don't always do with
my regular signature."

"He's done us," I answered, recognising it. "But how the dickens did he manage to transfer
it to the cheque? This looks like your own handwriting, Charles, not a clever forgery."

"It is," he said. "I admit it--I can't deny it. Only fancy his bamboozling me when I was most
on my guard! I wasn't to be taken in by any of his silly occult tricks and catch-words; but
it never occurred to me he was going to victimise me financially in this way. I expected attempts
at a loan or an extortion; but to collar my signature to a blank cheque--atrocious!"

"How did he manage it?" I asked.

"I haven't the faintest conception. I only know those are the words I wrote. I could swear
to them anywhere."

"Then you can't protest the cheque?"

"Unfortunately, no; it's my own true signature."

We went that afternoon without delay to see the Chief Commissary of Police at the office. He
was a gentlemanly Frenchman, much less formal and red-tapey than usual, and he spoke excellent
English with an American accent, having acted, in fact, as a detective in New York for about
ten years in his early manhood.

"I guess," he said slowly, after hearing our story, "you've been victimised right here by Colonel
Clay, gentlemen."

"Who is Colonel Clay?" Sir Charles asked.

"That's just what I want to know," the Commissary answered, in his curious American-French-English.
"He is a Colonel, because he occasionally gives himself a commission; he is called Colonel
Clay, because he appears to possess an india-rubber face, and he can mould it like clay in
the hands of the potter. Real name, unknown. Nationality, equally French and English. Address,
usually Europe. Profession, former maker of wax figures to the Museé Grévin. Age, what he chooses.
Employs his knowledge to mould his own nose and cheeks, with wax additions, to the character
he desires to personate. Aquiline this time, you say. Hein! Anything like these photographs?"

He rummaged in his desk and handed us two.

"Not in the least," Sir Charles answered. "Except, perhaps, as to the neck, everything here
is quite unlike him."

"Then that's the Colonel!" the Commissary answered, with decision, rubbing his hands in glee.
"Look here," and he took out a pencil and rapidly sketched the outline of one of the two faces--that
of a bland-looking young man, with no expression worth mentioning. "There's the Colonel in
his simple disguise. Very good. Now watch me: figure to yourself that he adds here a tiny patch
of wax to his nose--an aquiline bridge--just so; well, you have him right there; and the chin,
ah, one touch: now, for hair, a wig: for complexion, nothing easier: that's the profile of
your rascal, isn't it?"

"Exactly," we both murmured. By two curves of the pencil, and a shock of false hair, the face
was transmuted.

"He had very large eyes, with very big pupils, though," I objected, looking close; "and the
man in the photograph here has them small and boiled-fishy."

"That's so," the Commissary answered. "A drop of belladonna expands--and produces the Seer;
five grains of opium contract--and give a dead-alive, stupidly-innocent appearance. Well, you
leave this affair to me, gentlemen. I'll see the fun out. I don't say I'll catch him for you;
nobody ever yet has caught Colonel Clay; but I'll explain how he did the trick; and that ought
to be consolation enough to a man of your means for a trifle of five thousand!"

"You are not the conventional French office-holder, M. le Commissaire," I ventured to interpose.

"You bet!" the Commissary replied, and drew himself up like a captain of infantry. "Messieurs,"
he continued, in French, with the utmost dignity, "I shall devote the resources of this office
to tracing out the crime, and, if possible, to effectuating the arrest of the culpable."

We telegraphed to London, of course, and we wrote to the bank, with a full description of the
suspected person. But I need hardly add that nothing came of it.

Three days later the Commissary called at our hotel. "Well, gentlemen," he said, "I am glad
to say I have discovered everything!"

"What? Arrested the Seer?" Sir Charles cried.

The Commissary drew back, almost horrified at the suggestion.

"Arrested Colonel Clay?" he exclaimed. "Mais, monsieur, we are only human! Arrested him? No,
not quite. But tracked out how he did it. That is already much--to unravel Colonel Clay, gentlemen!"

"Well, what do you make of it?" Sir Charles asked, crestfallen.

The Commissary sat down and gloated over his discovery. It was clear a well-planned crime amused
him vastly. "In the first place, monsieur," he said, "disabuse your mind of the idea that when
monsieur your secretary went out to fetch Señor Herrera that night, Señor Herrera didn't know
to whose rooms he was coming. Quite otherwise, in point of fact. I do not doubt myself that
Señor Herrera, or Colonel Clay (call him which you like), came to Nice this winter for no other
purpose than just to rob you."

"But I sent for him," my brother-in-law interposed.

"Yes; he meant you to send for him. He forced a card, so to speak. If he couldn't do that I
guess he would be a pretty poor conjurer. He had a lady of his own--his wife, let us say, or
his sister--stopping here at this hotel; a certain Madame Picardet. Through her he induced
several ladies of your circle to attend his séances. She and they spoke to you about him, and
aroused your curiosity. You may bet your bottom dollar that when he came to this room he came
ready primed and prepared with endless facts about both of you."

"What fools we have been, Sey," my brother-in-law exclaimed. "I see it all now. That designing
woman sent round before dinner to say I wanted to meet him; and by the time you got there he
was ready for bamboozling me."

"That's so," the Commissary answered. "He had your name ready painted on both his arms; and
he had made other preparations of still greater importance."

"You mean the cheque. Well, how did he get it?"

The Commissary opened the door. "Come in," he said. And a young man entered whom we recognised
at once as the chief clerk in the Foreign Department of the Crédit Marseillais, the principal
bank all along the Riviera.

"State what you know of this cheque," the Commissary said, showing it to him, for we had handed
it over to the police as a piece of evidence.

"About four weeks since--" the clerk began.

"Say ten days before your séance," the Commissary interposed.

"A gentleman with very long hair and an aquiline nose, dark, strange, and handsome, called
in at my department and asked if I could tell him the name of Sir Charles Vandrift's London
banker. He said he had a sum to pay in to your credit, and asked if we would forward it for
him. I told him it was irregular for us to receive the money, as you had no account with us,
but that your London bankers were Darby, Drummond, and Rothenberg, Limited."

"Quite right," Sir Charles murmured.

"Two days later a lady, Madame Picardet, who was a customer of ours, brought in a good cheque
for three hundred pounds, signed by a first-rate name, and asked us to pay it in on her behalf
to Darby, Drummond, and Rothenberg's, and to open a London account with them for her. We did
so, and received in reply a cheque-book."

"From which this cheque was taken, as I learn from the number, by telegram from London," the
Commissary put in. "Also, that on the same day on which your cheque was cashed, Madame Picardet,
in London, withdrew her balance."

"But how did the fellow get me to sign the cheque?" Sir Charles cried. "How did he manage the
card trick?"

The Commissary produced a similar card from his pocket. "Was that the sort of thing?" he asked.

"Precisely! A facsimile."

"I thought so. Well, our Colonel, I find, bought a packet of such cards, intended for admission
to a religious function, at a shop in the Quai Massena. He cut out the centre, and, see here--"
The Commissary turned it over, and showed a piece of paper pasted neatly over the back; this
he tore off, and there, concealed behind it, lay a folded cheque, with only the place where
the signature should be written showing through on the face which the Seer had presented to
us. "I call that a neat trick," the Commissary remarked, with professional enjoyment of a really
good deception.

"But he burnt the envelope before my eyes," Sir Charles exclaimed.

"Pooh!" the Commissary answered. "What would he be worth as a conjurer, anyway, if he couldn't
substitute one envelope for another between the table and the fireplace without your noticing
it? And Colonel Clay, you must remember, is a prince among conjurers."

"Well, it's a comfort to know we've identified our man, and the woman who was with him," Sir
Charles said, with a slight sigh of relief. "The next thing will be, of course, you'll follow
them up on these clues in England and arrest them?"

The Commissary shrugged his shoulders. "Arrest them!" he exclaimed, much amused. "Ah, monsieur,
but you are sanguine! No officer of justice has ever succeeded in arresting le Colonel Caoutchouc,
as we call him in French. He is as slippery as an eel, that man. He wriggles through our fingers.
Suppose even we caught him, what could we prove? I ask you. Nobody who has seen him once can
ever swear to him again in his next impersonation. He is impayable, this good Colonel. On the
day when I arrest him, I assure you, monsieur, I shall consider myself the smartest police-officer
in Europe."

"Well, I shall catch him yet," Sir Charles answered, and relapsed into silence.

II

THE EPISODE OF THE DIAMOND LINKS

"Let us take a trip to Switzerland," said Lady Vandrift. And any one who knows Amelia will
not be surprised to learn that we did take a trip to Switzerland accordingly. Nobody can drive
Sir Charles, except his wife. And nobody at all can drive Amelia.

There were difficulties at the outset, because we had not ordered rooms at the hotels beforehand,
and it was well on in the season; but they were overcome at last by the usual application of
a golden key; and we found ourselves in due time pleasantly quartered in Lucerne, at that most
comfortable of European hostelries, the Schweitzerhof.

We were a square party of four--Sir Charles and Amelia, myself and Isabel. We had nice big
rooms, on the first floor, overlooking the lake; and as none of us was possessed with the faintest
symptom of that incipient mania which shows itself in the form of an insane desire to climb
mountain heights of disagreeable steepness and unnecessary snowiness, I will venture to assert
we all enjoyed ourselves. We spent most of our time sensibly in lounging about the lake on
the jolly little steamers; and when we did a mountain climb, it was on the Rigi or Pilatus--where
an engine undertook all the muscular work for us.

As usual, at the hotel, a great many miscellaneous people showed a burning desire to be specially
nice to us. If you wish to see how friendly and charming humanity is, just try being a well-known
millionaire for a week, and you'll learn a thing or two. Wherever Sir Charles goes he is surrounded
by charming and disinterested people, all eager to make his distinguished acquaintance, and
all familiar with several excellent investments, or several deserving objects of Christian
charity. It is my business in life, as his brother-in-law and secretary, to decline with thanks
the excellent investments, and to throw judicious cold water on the objects of charity. Even
I myself, as the great man's almoner, am very much sought after. People casually allude before
me to artless stories of "poor curates in Cumberland, you know, Mr. Wentworth," or widows in
Cornwall, penniless poets with epics in their desks, and young painters who need but the breath
of a patron to open to them the doors of an admiring Academy. "none to mind." it is to be hoped so, man, "Seurrot;" i care bosom,

"The concierge may know," Isabel suggested, looking over my shoulder.

We asked at his office.

Yes, the gentleman's address was the Rev. Richard Peploe Brabazon, Holme Bush Cottage, Empingham,
Northumberland.

Any address where letters might be sent at once, in Paris?

For the next ten days, or till further notice, Hôtel des Deux Mondes, Avenue de l'Opéra.

Amelia's mind was made up at once.

"Strike while the iron's hot," she cried. "This sudden illness, coming at the end of their
honeymoon, and involving ten days' more stay at an expensive hotel, will probably upset the
curate's budget. He'll be glad to sell now. You'll get them for three hundred. It was absurd
of Charles to offer so much at first; but offered once, of course we must stick to it."

"What do you propose to do?" Charles asked. "Write, or telegraph?"

"Oh, how silly men are!" Amelia cried. "Is this the sort of business to be arranged by letter,
still less by telegram? No. Seymour must start off at once, taking the night train to Paris;
and the moment he gets there, he must interview the curate or Mrs. Brabazon. Mrs. Brabazon's
the best. She has none of this stupid, sentimental nonsense about Uncle Aubrey."

It is no part of a secretary's duties to act as a diamond broker. But when Amelia puts her
foot down, she puts her foot down--a fact which she is unnecessarily fond of emphasising in
that identical proposition. So the self-same evening saw me safe in the train on my way to
Paris; and next morning I turned out of my comfortable sleeping-car at the Gare de Strasbourg.
My orders were to bring back those diamonds, alive or dead, so to speak, in my pocket to Lucerne;
and to offer any needful sum, up to two thousand five hundred pounds, for their immediate purchase.

When I arrived at the Deux Mondes I found the poor little curate and his wife both greatly
agitated. They had sat up all night, they said, with their invalid sister; and the sleeplessness
and suspense had certainly told upon them after their long railway journey. They were pale
and tired, Mrs. Brabazon, in particular, looking ill and worried--too much like White Heather.
I was more than half ashamed of bothering them about the diamonds at such a moment, but it
occurred to me that Amelia was probably right--they would now have reached the end of the sum
set apart for their Continental trip, and a little ready cash might be far from unwelcome.

I broached the subject delicately. It was a fad of Lady Vandrift's, I said. She had set her
heart upon those useless trinkets. And she wouldn't go without them. She must and would have
them. But the curate was obdurate. He threw Uncle Aubrey still in my teeth. Three hundred?--no,
never! A mother's present; impossible, dear Jessie! Jessie begged and prayed; she had grown
really attached to Lady Vandrift, she said; but the curate wouldn't hear of it. I went up tentatively
to four hundred. He shook his head gloomily. It wasn't a question of money, he said. It was
a question of affection. I saw it was no use trying that tack any longer. I struck out a new
line. "These stones," I said, "I think I ought to inform you, are really diamonds. Sir Charles
is certain of it. Now, is it right for a man of your profession and position to be wearing
a pair of big gems like those, worth several hundred pounds, as ordinary sleeve-links? A woman?--yes,
I grant you. But for a man, is it manly? And you a cricketer!"

He looked at me and laughed. "Will nothing convince you?" he cried. "They have been examined
and tested by half a dozen jewellers, and we know them to be paste. It wouldn't be right of
me to sell them to you under false pretences, however unwilling on my side. I couldn't do it."

"Well, then," I said, going up a bit in my bids to meet him, "I'll put it like this. These
gems are paste. But Lady Vandrift has an unconquerable and unaccountable desire to possess
them. Money doesn't matter to her. She is a friend of your wife's. As a personal favour, won't
you sell them to her for a thousand?"

He shook his head. "It would be wrong," he said,--"I might even add, criminal."

"But we take all risk," I cried.

He was absolute adamant. "As a clergyman," he answered, "I feel I cannot do it."

"Will you try, Mrs. Brabazon?" I asked.

The pretty little Scotchwoman leant over and whispered. She coaxed and cajoled him. Her ways
were winsome. I couldn't hear what she said, but he seemed to give way at last. "I should love
Lady Vandrift to have them," she murmured, turning to me. "She is such a dear!" And she took
out the links from her husband's cuffs and handed them across to me.

"How much?" I asked.

"Two thousand?" she answered, interrogatively. It was a big rise, all at once; but such are
the ways of women.

"Done!" I replied. "Do you consent?"

The curate looked up as if ashamed of himself.

"I consent," he said slowly, "since Jessie wishes it. But as a clergyman, and to prevent any
future misunderstanding, I should like you to give me a statement in writing that you buy them
on my distinct and positive declaration that they are made of paste--old Oriental paste--not
genuine stones, and that I do not claim any other qualities for them."

I popped the gems into my purse, well pleased.

"Certainly," I said, pulling out a paper. Charles, with his unerring business instinct, had
anticipated the request, and given me a signed agreement to that effect.

"You will take a cheque?" I inquired.

He hesitated.

"Notes of the Bank of France would suit me better," he answered.

"Very well," I replied. "I will go out and get them."

How very unsuspicious some people are! He allowed me to go off--with the stones in my pocket!

Sir Charles had given me a blank cheque, not exceeding two thousand five hundred pounds. I
took it to our agents and cashed it for notes of the Bank of France. The curate clasped them
with pleasure. And right glad I was to go back to Lucerne that night, feeling that I had got
those diamonds into my hands for about a thousand pounds under their real value!

At Lucerne railway station Amelia met me. She was positively agitated.

"Have you bought them, Seymour?" she asked.

"Yes," I answered, producing my spoils in triumph.

"Oh, how dreadful!" she cried, drawing back. "Do you think they're real? Are you sure he hasn't
cheated you?"

"Certain of it," I replied, examining them. "No one can take me in, in the matter of diamonds.
Why on earth should you doubt them?"

"Because I've been talking to Mrs. O'Hagan, at the hotel, and she says there's a well-known
trick just like that--she's read of it in a book. A swindler has two sets--one real, one false;
and he makes you buy the false ones by showing you the real, and pretending he sells them as
a special favour."

"You needn't be alarmed," I answered. "I am a judge of diamonds."

"I shan't be satisfied," Amelia murmured, "till Charles has seen them."

We went up to the hotel. For the first time in her life I saw Amelia really nervous as I handed
the stones to Charles to examine. Her doubt was contagious. I half feared, myself, he might
break out into a deep monosyllabic interjection, losing his temper in haste, as he often does
when things go wrong. But he looked at them with a smile, while I told him the price.

"Eight hundred pounds less than their value," he answered, well satisfied.

"You have no doubt of their reality?" I asked.

"Not the slightest," he replied, gazing at them. "They are genuine stones, precisely the same
in quality and type as Amelia's necklet."

Amelia drew a sigh of relief. "I'll go upstairs," she said slowly, "and bring down my own for
you both to compare with them."

One minute later she rushed down again, breathless. Amelia is far from slim, and I never before
knew her exert herself so actively.

"Charles, Charles!" she cried, "do you know what dreadful thing has happened? Two of my own
stones are gone. He's stolen a couple of diamonds from my necklet, and sold them back to me."

She held out the rivière. It was all too true. Two gems were missing--and these two just fitted
the empty places!

A light broke in upon me. I clapped my hand to my head. "By Jove," I exclaimed, "the little
curate is--Colonel Clay!"

Charles clapped his own hand to his brow in turn. "And Jessie," he cried, "White Heather--that
innocent little Scotchwoman! I often detected a familiar ring in her voice, in spite of the
charming Highland accent. Jessie is--Madame Picardet!"

We had absolutely no evidence; but, like the Commissary at Nice, we felt instinctively sure of it.

Sir Charles was determined to catch the rogue. This second deception put him on his mettle.
"The worst of the man is," he said, "he has a method. He doesn't go out of his way to cheat
us; he makes us go out of ours to be cheated. He lays a trap, and we tumble headlong into it.
To-morrow, Sey, we must follow him on to Paris."

Amelia explained to him what Mrs. O'Hagan had said. Charles took it all in at once, with his
usual sagacity. "That explains," he said, "why the rascal used this particular trick to draw
us on by. If we had suspected him he could have shown the diamonds were real, and so escaped
detection. It was a blind to draw us off from the fact of the robbery. He went to Paris to
be out of the way when the discovery was made, and to get a clear day's start of us. What a
consummate rogue! And to do me twice running!"

"How did he get at my jewel-case, though?" Amelia exclaimed.

"That's the question," Charles answered. "You do leave it about so!"

"And why didn't he steal the whole rivière at once, and sell the gems?" I inquired.

"Too cunning," Charles replied. "This was much better business. It isn't easy to dispose of
a big thing like that. In the first place, the stones are large and valuable; in the second
place, they're well known--every dealer has heard of the Vandrift rivière, and seen pictures
of the shape of them. They're marked gems, so to speak. No, he played a better game--took a
couple of them off, and offered them to the only one person on earth who was likely to buy
them without suspicion. He came here, meaning to work this very trick; he had the links made
right to the shape beforehand, and then he stole the stones and slipped them into their places.
It's a wonderfully clever trick. Upon my soul, I almost admire the fellow."

For Charles is a business man himself, and can appreciate business capacity in others.

How Colonel Clay came to know about that necklet, and to appropriate two of the stones, we
only discovered much later. I will not here anticipate that disclosure. One thing at a time
is a good rule in life. For the moment he succeeded in baffling us altogether.

However, we followed him on to Paris, telegraphing beforehand to the Bank of France to stop
the notes. It was all in vain. They had been cashed within half an hour of my paying them.
The curate and his wife, we found, quitted the Hôtel des Deux Mondes for parts unknown that
same afternoon. And, as usual with Colonel Clay, they vanished into space, leaving no clue
behind them. In other words, they changed their disguise, no doubt, and reappeared somewhere
else that night in altered characters. At any rate, no such person as the Reverend Richard
Peploe Brabazon was ever afterwards heard of--and, for the matter of that, no such village
exists as Empingham, Northumberland.

We communicated the matter to the Parisian police. They were most unsympathetic. "It is no
doubt Colonel Clay," said the official whom we saw; "but you seem to have little just ground
of complaint against him. As far as I can see, messieurs, there is not much to choose between
you. You, Monsieur le Chevalier, desired to buy diamonds at the price of paste. You, madame,
feared you had bought paste at the price of diamonds. You, monsieur the secretary, tried to
get the stones from an unsuspecting person for half their value. He took you all in, that brave
Colonel Caoutchouc--it was diamond cut diamond."

Which was true, no doubt, but by no means consoling.

We returned to the Grand Hotel. Charles was fuming with indignation. "This is really too much,"
he exclaimed. "What an audacious rascal! But he will never again take me in, my dear Sey. I
only hope he'll try it on. I should love to catch him. I'd know him another time, I'm sure,
in spite of his disguises. It's absurd my being tricked twice running like this. But never
again while I live! Never again, I declare to you!"

"Jamais de la vie!" a courier in the hall close by murmured responsive. We stood under the
verandah of the Grand Hotel, in the big glass courtyard. And I verily believe that courier
was really Colonel Clay himself in one of his disguises.

But perhaps we were beginning to suspect him everywhere.

III

THE EPISODE OF THE OLD MASTER

Like most South Africans, Sir Charles Vandrift is anything but sedentary. He hates sitting
down. He must always "trek." He cannot live without moving about freely. Six weeks in Mayfair
at a time is as much as he can stand. Then he must run away incontinently for rest and change
to Scotland, Homburg, Monte Carlo, Biarritz. "I won't be a limpet on the rock," he says. Thus
it came to pass that in the early autumn we found ourselves stopping at the Métropole at Brighton.
We were the accustomed nice little family party--Sir Charles and Amelia, myself and Isabel,
with the suite as usual.

On the first Sunday morning after our arrival we strolled out, Charles and I--I regret to say
during the hours allotted for Divine service--on to the King's Road, to get a whiff of fresh
air, and a glimpse of the waves that were churning the Channel. The two ladies (with their
bonnets) had gone to church; but Sir Charles had risen late, fatigued from the week's toil,
while I myself was suffering from a matutinal headache, which I attributed to the close air
in the billiard-room overnight, combined, perhaps, with the insidious effect of a brand of
soda-water to which I was little accustomed; I had used it to dilute my evening whisky. We
were to meet our wives afterwards at the church parade--an institution to which I believe both
Amelia and Isabel attach even greater importance than to the sermon which precedes it.

We sat down on a glass seat. Charles gazed inquiringly up and down the King's Road, on the
look-out for a boy with Sunday papers. At last one passed. "Observer," my brother-in-law called
out laconically.

"Ain't got none," the boy answered, brandishing his bundle in our faces. "'Ave a Referee or
a Pink 'Un?"

Charles, however, is not a Refereader, while as to the Pink 'Un, he considers it unsuitable
for public perusal on Sunday morning. It may be read indoors, but in the open air its blush
betrays it. So he shook his head, and muttered, "If you pass an Observer, send him on here
at once to me."

A polite stranger who sat close to us turned round with a pleasant smile. "Would you allow
me to offer you one?" he said, drawing a copy from his pocket. "I fancy I bought the last.
There's a run on them to-day, you see. Important news this morning from the Transvaal."

Charles raised his eyebrows, and accepted it, as I thought, just a trifle grumpily. So, to
remove the false impression his surliness might produce on so benevolent a mind, I entered
into conversation with the polite stranger. He was a man of middle age, and medium height,
with a cultivated air, and a pair of gold pince-nez; his eyes were sharp; his voice was refined;
he dropped into talk before long about distinguished people just then in Brighton. It was clear
at once that he was hand in glove with many of the very best kind. We compared notes as to
Nice, Rome, Florence, Cairo. Our new acquaintance had scores of friends in common with us,
it seemed; indeed, our circles so largely coincided, that I wondered we had never happened
till then to knock up against one another.

"And Sir Charles Vandrift, the great African millionaire," he said at last, "do you know anything
of him? I'm told he's at present down here at the Métropole."

I waved my hand towards the person in question.

"This is Sir Charles Vandrift," I answered, with proprietary pride; "and I am his brother-in-law,
Mr. Seymour Wentworth."

"Oh, indeed!" the stranger answered, with a curious air of drawing in his horns. I wondered
whether he had just been going to pretend he knew Sir Charles, or whether perchance he was
on the point of saying something highly uncomplimentary, and was glad to have escaped it.

By this time, however, Charles laid down the paper and chimed into our conversation. I could
see at once from his mollified tone that the news from the Transvaal was favourable to his
operations in Cloetedorp Golcondas. He was therefore in a friendly and affable temper. His
whole manner changed at once. He grew polite in return to the polite stranger. Besides, we
knew the man moved in the best society; he had acquaintances whom Amelia was most anxious to
secure for her "At Homes" in Mayfair--young Faith, the novelist, and Sir Richard Montrose,
the great Arctic traveller. As for the painters, it was clear that he was sworn friends with
the whole lot of them. He dined with Academicians, and gave weekly breakfasts to the members
of the Institute. Now, Amelia is particularly desirous that her salon should not be considered
too exclusively financial and political in character: with a solid basis of M.P.'s and millionaires,
she loves a delicate under-current of literature, art, and the musical glasses. Our new acquaintance
was extremely communicative: "Knows his place in society, Sey," Sir Charles said to me afterwards,
"and is therefore not afraid of talking freely, as so many people are who have doubts about
their position." We exchanged cards before we rose. Our new friend's name turned out to be
Dr. Edward Polperro.

"In practice here?" I inquired, though his garb belied it.

"Oh, not medical," he answered. "I am an LL.D. don't you know. I interest myself in art, and
buy to some extent for the National Gallery."

The very man for Amelia's "At Homes"! Sir Charles snapped at him instantly. "I've brought my
four-in-hand down here with me," he said, in his best friendly manner, "and we think of tooling
over to-morrow to Lewes. If you'd care to take a seat I'm sure Lady Vandrift would be charmed
to see you."

"You're very kind," the Doctor said, "on so casual an introduction. I'm sure I shall be delighted."

"We start from the Métropole at ten-thirty," Charles went on.

"I shall be there. Good morning!" And, with a satisfied smile, he rose and left us, nodding.

We returned to the lawn, to Amelia and Isabel. Our new friend passed us once or twice. Charles
stopped him and introduced him. He was walking with two ladies, most elegantly dressed in rather
peculiar artistic dresses. Amelia was taken at first sight by his manner. "One could see at
a glance," she said, "he was a person of culture and of real distinction. I wonder whether
he could bring the P.R.A. to my Parliamentary 'At Home' on Wednesday fortnight?"

Next day, at ten-thirty, we started on our drive. Our team has been considered the best in
Sussex. Charles is an excellent, though somewhat anxious--or, might I say better, somewhat
careful?--whip. He finds the management of two leaders and two wheelers fills his hands for
the moment, both literally and figuratively, leaving very little time for general conversation.
Lady Belleisle of Beacon bloomed beside him on the box (her bloom is perennial, and applied
by her maid); Dr. Polperro occupied the seat just behind with myself and Amelia. The Doctor
talked most of the time to Lady Vandrift: his discourse was of picture-galleries, which Amelia
detests, but in which she thinks it incumbent upon her, as Sir Charles's wife, to affect now
and then a cultivated interest. Noblesse oblige; and the walls of Castle Seldon, our place
in Ross-shire, are almost covered now with Leaders and with Orchardsons. This result was first
arrived at by a singular accident. Sir Charles wanted a leader--for his coach, you understand--and
told an artistic friend so. The artistic friend brought him a Leader next week with a capital
L; and Sir Charles was so taken aback that he felt ashamed to confess the error. So he was
turned unawares into a patron of painting.

Dr. Polperro, in spite of his too pronouncedly artistic talk, proved on closer view a most
agreeable companion. He diversified his art cleverly with anecdotes and scandals; he told us
exactly which famous painters had married their cooks, and which had only married their models;
and otherwise showed himself a most diverting talker. Among other things, however, he happened
to mention once that he had recently discovered a genuine Rembrandt--a quite undoubted Rembrandt,
which had remained for years in the keeping of a certain obscure Dutch family. It had always
been allowed to be a masterpiece of the painter, but it had seldom been seen for the last half-century
save by a few intimate acquaintances. It was a portrait of one Maria Vanrenen of Haarlem, and
he had bought it of her descendants at Gouda, in Holland.

I saw Charles prick up his ears, though he took no open notice. This Maria Vanrenen, as it
happened, was a remote collateral ancestress of the Vandrifts, before they emigrated to the
Cape in 1780; and the existence of the portrait, though not its whereabouts, was well known
in the family. Isabel had often mentioned it. If it was to be had at anything like a reasonable
price, it would be a splendid thing for the boys (Sir Charles, I ought to say, has two sons
at Eton) to possess an undoubted portrait of an ancestress by Rembrandt.

Dr. Polperro talked a good deal after that about this valuable find. He had tried to sell it
at first to the National Gallery; but though the Directors admired the work immensely, and
admitted its genuineness, they regretted that the funds at their disposal this year did not
permit them to acquire so important a canvas at a proper figure. South Kensington again was
too poor; but the Doctor was in treaty at present with the Louvre and with Berlin. Still, it
was a pity a fine work of art like that, once brought into the country, should be allowed to
go out of it. Some patriotic patron of the fine arts ought to buy it for his own house, or
else munificently present it to the nation.

All the time Charles said nothing. But I could feel him cogitating. He even looked behind him
once, near a difficult corner (while the guard was actually engaged in tootling his horn to
let passers-by know that the coach was coming), and gave Amelia a warning glance to say nothing
committing, which had at once the requisite effect of sealing her mouth for the moment. It
is a very unusual thing for Charles to look back while driving. I gathered from his doing so
that he was inordinately anxious to possess this Rembrandt.

When we arrived at Lewes we put up our horses at the inn, and Charles ordered a lunch on his
wonted scale of princely magnificence. Meanwhile we wandered, two and two, about the town and
castle. I annexed Lady Belleisle, who is at least amusing. Charles drew me aside before starting.
"Look here, Sey," he said, "we must be very careful. This man, Polperro, is a chance acquaintance.
There's nothing an astute rogue can take one in over more easily than an Old Master. If the
Rembrandt is genuine I ought to have it; if it really represents Maria Vanrenen, it's a duty
I owe to the boys to buy it. But I've been done twice lately, and I won't be done a third time.
We must go to work cautiously."

"You are right," I answered. "No more seers and curates!"

"If this man's an impostor," Charles went on--"and in spite of what he says about the National
Gallery and so forth, we know nothing of him--the story he tells is just the sort of one such
a fellow would trump up in a moment to deceive me. He could easily learn who I was--I'm a well-known
figure; he knew I was in Brighton, and he may have been sitting on that glass seat on Sunday
on purpose to entrap me."

"He introduced your name," I said, "and the moment he found out who I was he plunged into talk
with me."

"Yes," Charles continued. "He may have learned about the portrait of Maria Vanrenen, which
my grandmother always said was preserved at Gouda; and, indeed, I myself have often mentioned
it, as you doubtless remember. If so, what more natural, say, for a rogue than to begin talking
about the portrait in that innocent way to Amelia? If he wants a Rembrandt, I believe they
can be turned out to order to any amount in Birmingham. The moral of all which is, it behoves
us to be careful."

"Right you are," I answered; "and I am keeping my eye upon him."

We drove back by another road, overshadowed by beech-trees in autumnal gold. It was a delightful
excursion. Dr. Polperro's heart was elated by lunch and the excellent dry Monopole. He talked
amazingly. I never heard a man with a greater or more varied flow of anecdote. He had been
everywhere and knew all about everybody. Amelia booked him at once for her "At Home" on Wednesday
week, and he promised to introduce her to several artistic and literary celebrities.

That evening, however, about half-past seven, Charles and I strolled out together on the King's
Road for a blow before dinner. We dine at eight. The air was delicious. We passed a small new
hotel, very smart and exclusive, with a big bow window. There, in evening dress, lights burning
and blind up, sat our friend, Dr. Polperro, with a lady facing him, young, graceful, and pretty.
A bottle of champagne stood open before him. He was helping himself plentifully to hot-house
grapes, and full of good humour. It was clear he and the lady were occupied in the intense
enjoyment of some capital joke; for they looked queerly at one another, and burst now and again
into merry peals of laughter.

I drew back. So did Sir Charles. One idea passed at once through both our minds. I murmured,
"Colonel Clay!" He answered, "and Madame Picardet!"

They were not in the least like the Reverend Richard and Mrs. Brabazon. But that clinched the
matter. Nor did I see a sign of the aquiline nose of the Mexican Seer. Still, I had learnt
by then to discount appearances. If these were indeed the famous sharper and his wife or accomplice,
we must be very careful. We were forewarned this time. Supposing he had the audacity to try
a third trick of the sort upon us we had him under our thumbs. Only, we must take steps to
prevent his dexterously slipping through our fingers.

"He can wriggle like an eel," said the Commissary at Nice. We both recalled those words, and
laid our plans deep to prevent the man's wriggling away from us on this third occasion.

"I tell you what it is, Sey," my brother-in-law said, with impressive slowness. "This time
we must deliberately lay ourselves out to be swindled. We must propose of our own accord to
buy the picture, making him guarantee it in writing as a genuine Rembrandt, and taking care
to tie him down by most stringent conditions. But we must seem at the same time to be unsuspicious
and innocent as babes; we must swallow whole whatever lies he tells us; pay his price--nominally--by
cheque for the portrait; and then, arrest him the moment the bargain is complete, with the
proofs of his guilt then and there upon him. Of course, what he'll try to do will be to vanish
into thin air at once, as he did at Nice and Paris; but, this time, we'll have the police in
waiting and everything ready. We'll avoid precipitancy, but we'll avoid delay too. We must
hold our hands off till he's actually accepted and pocketed the money; and then, we must nab
him instantly, and walk him off to the local Bow Street. That's my plan of campaign. Meanwhile,
we should appear all trustful innocence and confiding guilelessness."

In pursuance of this well-laid scheme, we called next day on Dr. Polperro at his hotel, and
were introduced to his wife, a dainty little woman, in whom we affected not to recognise that
arch Madame Picardet or that simple White Heather. The Doctor talked charmingly (as usual)
about art--what a well-informed rascal he was, to be sure!--and Sir Charles expressed some
interest in the supposed Rembrandt. Our new friend was delighted; we could see by his well-suppressed
eagerness of tone that he knew us at once for probable purchasers. He would run up to town
next day, he said, and bring down the portrait. And in effect, when Charles and I took our
wonted places in the Pullman next morning, on our way up to the half-yearly meeting of Cloetedorp
Golcondas, there was our Doctor, leaning back in his arm-chair as if the car belonged to him.
Charles gave me an expressive look. "Does it in style," he whispered, "doesn't he? Takes it
out of my five thousand; or discounts the amount he means to chouse me of with his spurious
Rembrandt."

Arrived in town, we went to work at once. We set a private detective from Marvillier's to watch
our friend; and from him we learned that the so-called Doctor dropped in for a picture that
day at a dealer's in the West-end (I suppress the name, having a judicious fear of the law
of libel ever before my eyes), a dealer who was known to be mixed up before then in several
shady or disreputable transactions. Though, to be sure, my experience has been that picture
dealers are--picture dealers. Horses rank first in my mind as begetters and producers of unscrupulous
agents, but pictures run them a very good second. Anyhow, we found out that our distinguished
art-critic picked up his Rembrandt at this dealer's shop, and came down with it in his care
the same night to Brighton.

In order not to act precipitately, and so ruin our plans, we induced Dr. Polperro (what a cleverly
chosen name!) to bring the Rembrandt round to the Métropole for our inspection, and to leave
it with us while we got the opinion of an expert from London.

The expert came down, and gave us a full report upon the alleged Old Master. In his judgment,
it was not a Rembrandt at all, but a cunningly-painted and well-begrimed modern Dutch imitation.
Moreover, he showed us by documentary evidence that the real portrait of Maria Vanrenen had,
as a matter of fact, been brought to England five years before, and sold to Sir J. H. Tomlinson,
the well-known connoisseur, for eight thousand pounds. Dr. Polperro's picture was, therefore,
at best either a replica by Rembrandt; or else, more probably, a copy by a pupil; or, most
likely of all, a mere modern forgery.

We were thus well prepared to fasten our charge of criminal conspiracy upon the self-styled
Doctor. But in order to make assurance still more certain, we threw out vague hints to him
that the portrait of Maria Vanrenen might really be elsewhere, and even suggested in his hearing
that it might not improbably have got into the hands of that omnivorous collector, Sir J. H.
Tomlinson. But the vendor was proof against all such attempts to decry his goods. He had the
effrontery to brush away the documentary evidence, and to declare that Sir J. H. Tomlinson
(one of the most learned and astute picture-buyers in England) had been smartly imposed upon
by a needy Dutch artist with a talent for forgery. The real Maria Vanrenen, he declared and
swore, was the one he offered us. "Success has turned the man's head," Charles said to me,
well pleased. "He thinks we will swallow any obvious lie he chooses to palm off upon us. But
the bucket has come once too often to the well. This time we checkmate him." It was a mixed
metaphor, I admit; but Sir Charles's tropes are not always entirely superior to criticism.

So we pretended to believe our man, and accepted his assurances. Next came the question of
price. This was warmly debated, for form's sake only. Sir J. H. Tomlinson had paid eight thousand
for his genuine Maria. The Doctor demanded ten thousand for his spurious one. There was really
no reason why we should higgle and dispute, for Charles meant merely to give his cheque for
the sum and then arrest the fellow; but, still, we thought it best for the avoidance of suspicion
to make a show of resistance; and we at last beat him down to nine thousand guineas. For this
amount he was to give us a written warranty that the work he sold us was a genuine Rembrandt,
that it represented Maria Vanrenen of Haarlem, and that he had bought it direct, without doubt
or question, from that good lady's descendants at Gouda, in Holland.

It was capitally done. We arranged the thing to perfection. We had a constable in waiting in
our rooms at the Métropole, and we settled that Dr. Polperro was to call at the hotel at a
certain fixed hour to sign the warranty and receive his money. A regular agreement on sound
stamped paper was drawn out between us. At the appointed time the "party of the first part"
came, having already given us over possession of the portrait. Charles drew a cheque for the
amount agreed upon, and signed it. Then he handed it to the Doctor. Polperro just clutched
at it. Meanwhile, I took up my post by the door, while two men in plain clothes, detectives
from the police-station, stood as men-servants and watched the windows. We feared lest the
impostor, once he had got the cheque, should dodge us somehow, as he had already done at Nice
and in Paris. The moment he had pocketed his money with a smile of triumph, I advanced to him
rapidly. I had in my possession a pair of handcuffs. Before he knew what was happening, I had
slipped them on his wrists and secured them dexterously, while the constable stepped forward.
"We have got you this time!" I cried. "We know who you are, Dr. Polperro. You are--Colonel
Clay, alias Señor Antonio Herrera, alias the Reverend Richard Peploe Brabazon."

I never saw any man so astonished in my life! He was utterly flabbergasted. Charles thought
he must have expected to get clear away at once, and that this prompt action on our part had
taken the fellow so much by surprise as to simply unman him. He gazed about him as if he hardly
realised what was happening.

"Are these two raving maniacs?" he asked at last, "or what do they mean by this nonsensical
gibberish about Antonio Herrera?"

The constable laid his hand on the prisoner's shoulder.

"It's all right, my man," he said. "We've got warrants out against you. I arrest you, Edward
Polperro, alias the Reverend Richard Peploe Brabazon, on a charge of obtaining money under
false pretences from Sir Charles Vandrift, K.C.M.G., M.P., on his sworn information, now here
subscribed to." For Charles had had the thing drawn out in readiness beforehand.

Our prisoner drew himself up. "Look here, officer," he said, in an offended tone, "there's
some mistake here in this matter. I have never given an alias at any time in my life. How do
you know this is really Sir Charles Vandrift? It may be a case of bullying personation. My
belief is, though, they're a pair of escaped lunatics."

"We'll see about that to-morrow," the constable said, collaring him. "At present you've got
to go off with me quietly to the station, where these gentlemen will enter up the charge against
you."

They carried him off, protesting. Charles and I signed the charge-sheet; and the officer locked
him up to await his examination next day before the magistrate.

We were half afraid even now the fellow would manage somehow to get out on bail and give us
the slip in spite of everything; and, indeed, he protested in the most violent manner against
the treatment to which we were subjecting "a gentleman in his position." But Charles took care
to tell the police it was all right; that he was a dangerous and peculiarly slippery criminal,
and that on no account must they let him go on any pretext whatever, till he had been properly
examined before the magistrates.

We learned at the hotel that night, curiously enough, that there really was a Dr. Polperro,
a distinguished art critic, whose name, we didn't doubt, our impostor had been assuming.

Next morning, when we reached the court, an inspector met us with a very long face. "Look here,
gentlemen," he said, "I'm afraid you've committed a very serious blunder. You've made a precious
bad mess of it. You've got yourselves into a scrape; and, what's worse, you've got us into
one also. You were a deal too smart with your sworn information. We've made inquiries about
this gentleman, and we find the account he gives of himself is perfectly correct. His name
is Polperro; he's a well-known art critic and collector of pictures, employed abroad by the
National Gallery. He was formerly an official in the South Kensington Museum, and he's a C.B.
and LL.D., very highly respected. You've made a sad mistake, that's where it is; and you'll
probably have to answer a charge of false imprisonment, in which I'm afraid you have also involved
our own department."

Charles gasped with horror. "You haven't let him out," he cried, "on those absurd representations?
You haven't let him slip through your hands as you did that murderer fellow?"

"Let him slip through our hands?" the inspector cried. "I only wish he would. There's no chance
of that, unfortunately. He's in the court there, this moment, breathing out fire and slaughter
against you both; and we're here to protect you if he should happen to fall upon you. He's
been locked up all night on your mistaken affidavits, and, naturally enough, he's mad with anger."

"If you haven't let him go, I'm satisfied," Charles answered. "He's a fox for cunning. Where
is he? Let me see him."

We went into the court. There we saw our prisoner conversing amicably, in the most excited
way, with the magistrate (who, it seems, was a personal friend of his); and Charles at once
went up and spoke to them. Dr. Polperro turned round and glared at him through his pince-nez.

"The only possible explanation of this person's extraordinary and incredible conduct," he said,
"is, that he must be mad--and his secretary equally so. He made my acquaintance, unasked, on
a glass seat on the King's Road; invited me to go on his coach to Lewes; volunteered to buy
a valuable picture of me; and then, at the last moment, unaccountably gave me in charge on
this silly and preposterous trumped-up accusation. I demand a summons for false imprisonment."

Suddenly it began to dawn upon us that the tables were turned. By degrees it came out that
we had made a mistake. Dr. Polperro was really the person he represented himself to be, and
had been always. His picture, we found out, was the real Maria Vanrenen, and a genuine Rembrandt,
which he had merely deposited for cleaning and restoring at the suspicious dealer's. Sir J.
H. Tomlinson had been imposed upon and cheated by a cunning Dutchman; his picture, though also
an undoubted Rembrandt, was not the Maria, and was an inferior specimen in bad preservation.
The authority we had consulted turned out to be an ignorant, self-sufficient quack. The Maria,
moreover, was valued by other experts at no more than five or six thousand guineas. Charles
wanted to cry off his bargain, but Dr. Polperro naturally wouldn't hear of it. The agreement
was a legally binding instrument, and what passed in Charles's mind at the moment had nothing
to do with the written contract. Our adversary only consented to forego the action for false
imprisonment on condition that Charles inserted a printed apology in the Times, and paid him
five hundred pounds compensation for damage to character. So that was the end of our well-planned
attempt to arrest the swindler.

Not quite the end, however; for, of course, after this, the whole affair got by degrees into
the papers. Dr. Polperro, who was a familiar person in literary and artistic society, as it
turned out, brought an action against the so-called expert who had declared against the genuineness
of his alleged Rembrandt, and convicted him of the grossest ignorance and misstatement. Then
paragraphs got about. The World showed us up in a sarcastic article; and Truth, which has always
been terribly severe upon Sir Charles and all the other South Africans, had a pungent set of
verses on "High Art in Kimberley." By this means, as we suppose, the affair became known to
Colonel Clay himself; for a week or two later my brother-in-law received a cheerful little
note on scented paper from our persistent sharper. It was couched in these terms:--

"Oh, you innocent infant!

"Bless your ingenuous little heart! And did it believe, then, it had positively caught the
redoubtable colonel? And had it ready a nice little pinch of salt to put upon his tail? And
is it true its respected name is Sir Simple Simon? How heartily we have laughed, White Heather
and I, at your neat little ruses! It would pay you, by the way, to take White Heather into
your house for six months to instruct you in the agreeable sport of amateur detectives. Your
charming naivete quite moves our envy. So you actually imagined a man of my brains would condescend
to anything so flat and stale as the silly and threadbare Old Master deception! And this in
the so-called nineteenth century! O sancta simplicitas! When again shall such infantile transparency
be mine? When, ah, when? But never mind, dear friend. Though you didn't catch me, we shall
meet before long at some delightful Philippi.

"Yours, with the profoundest respect and gratitude,

"ANTONIO HERRERA,

"Otherwise RICHARD PEPLOE BRABAZON."

Charles laid down the letter with a deep-drawn sigh. "Sey, my boy," he mused aloud, "no fortune
on earth--not even mine--can go on standing it. These perpetual drains begin really to terrify
me. I foresee the end. I shall die in a workhouse. What with the money he robs me of when he
is Colonel Clay, and the money I waste upon him when he isn't Colonel Clay, the man is beginning
to tell upon my nervous system. I shall withdraw altogether from this worrying life. I shall
retire from a scheming and polluted world to some untainted spot in the fresh, pure mountains."

"You must need rest and change," I said, "when you talk like that. Let us try the Tyrol."

IV

THE EPISODE OF THE TYROLEAN CASTLE

We went to Meran. The place was practically decided for us by Amelia's French maid, who really
acts on such occasions as our guide and courier.

She is such a clever girl, is Amelia's French maid. Whenever we are going anywhere, Amelia
generally asks (and accepts) her advice as to choice of hotels and furnished villas. Césarine
has been all over the Continent in her time; and, being Alsatian by birth, she of course speaks
German as well as she speaks French, while her long residence with Amelia has made her at last
almost equally at home in our native English. She is a treasure, that girl; so neat and dexterous,
and not above dabbling in anything on earth she may be asked to turn her hand to. She walks
the world with a needle-case in one hand and an etna in the other. She can cook an omelette
on occasion, or drive a Norwegian cariole; she can sew, and knit, and make dresses, and cure
a cold, and do anything else on earth you ask her. Her salads are the most savoury I ever tasted;
while as for her coffee (which she prepares for us in the train on long journeys), there isn't
a chef de cuisine at a West-end club to be named in the same day with her.

So, when Amelia said, in her imperious way, "Césarine, we want to go to the Tyrol--now--at
once--in mid-October; where do you advise us to put up?"--Césarine answered, like a shot, "The
Erzherzog Johann, of course, at Meran, for the autumn, madame."

"Is he ... an archduke?" Amelia asked, a little staggered at such apparent familiarity with
Imperial personages.

"Ma foi! no, madame. He is an hotel--as you would say in England, the 'Victoria' or the 'Prince
of Wales's'--the most comfortable hotel in all South Tyrol; and at this time of year, naturally,
you must go beyond the Alps; it begins already to be cold at Innsbruck."

So to Meran we went; and a prettier or more picturesque place, I confess, I have seldom set
eyes on. A rushing torrent; high hills and mountain peaks; terraced vineyard slopes; old walls
and towers; quaint, arcaded streets; a craggy waterfall; a promenade after the fashion of a
German Spa; and when you lift your eyes from the ground, jagged summits of Dolomites: it was
a combination such as I had never before beheld; a Rhine town plumped down among green Alpine
heights, and threaded by the cool colonnades of Italy.

I approved Césarine's choice; and I was particularly glad she had pronounced for an hotel,
where all is plain sailing, instead of advising a furnished villa, the arrangements for which
would naturally have fallen in large part upon the shoulders of the wretched secretary. As
in any case I have to do three hours' work a day, I feel that such additions to my normal burden
may well be spared me. I tipped Césarine half a sovereign, in fact, for her judicious choice.
Césarine glanced at it on her palm in her mysterious, curious, half-smiling way, and pocketed
it at once with a "Merci, monsieur!" that had a touch of contempt in it. I always fancy Césarine
has large ideas of her own on the subject of tipping, and thinks very small beer of the modest
sums a mere secretary can alone afford to bestow upon her.

The great peculiarity of Meran is the number of schlosses (I believe my plural is strictly
irregular, but very convenient to English ears) which you can see in every direction from its
outskirts. A statistical eye, it is supposed, can count no fewer than forty of these picturesque,
ramshackled old castles from a point on the Küchelberg. For myself, I hate statistics (except
as an element in financial prospectuses), and I really don't know how many ruinous piles Isabel
and Amelia counted under Césarine's guidance; but I remember that most of them were quaint
and beautiful, and that their variety of architecture seemed positively bewildering. One would
be square, with funny little turrets stuck out at each angle; while another would rejoice in
a big round keep, and spread on either side long, ivy-clad walls and delightful bastions. Charles
was immensely taken with them. He loves the picturesque, and has a poet hidden in that financial
soul of his. (Very effectually hidden, though, I am ready to grant you.) From the moment he
came he felt at once he would love to possess a castle of his own among these romantic mountains.
"Seldon!" he exclaimed contemptuously. "They call Seldon a castle! But you and I know very
well, Sey, it was built in 1860, with sham antique stones, for Macpherson of Seldon, at market
rates, by Cubitt and Co., worshipful contractors of London. Macpherson charged me for that
sham antiquity a preposterous price, at which one ought to procure a real ancestral mansion.
Now, these castles are real. They are hoary with antiquity. Schloss Tyrol is Romanesque--tenth
or eleventh century." (He had been reading it up in Baedeker.) "That's the sort of place for
me!--tenth or eleventh century. I could live here, remote from stocks and shares, for ever;
and in these sequestered glens, recollect, Sey, my boy, there are no Colonel Clays, and no
arch Madame Picardets!"

As a matter of fact, he could have lived there six weeks, and then tired for Park Lane, Monte
Carlo, Brighton.

As for Amelia, strange to say, she was equally taken with this new fad of Charles's. As a rule
she hates everywhere on earth save London, except during the time when no respectable person
can be seen in town, and when modest blinds shade the scandalised face of Mayfair and Belgravia.
She bores herself to death even at Seldon Castle, Ross-shire, and yawns all day long in Paris
or Vienna. She is a confirmed Cockney. Yet, for some occult reason, my amiable sister-in-law
fell in love with South Tyrol. She wanted to vegetate in that lush vegetation. The grapes were
being picked; pumpkins hung over the walls; Virginia creeper draped the quaint gray schlosses
with crimson cloaks; and everything was as beautiful as a dream of Burne-Jones's. (I know I
am quite right in mentioning Burne-Jones, especially in connection with Romanesque architecture,
because I heard him highly praised on that very ground by our friend and enemy, Dr. Edward
Polperro.) So perhaps it was excusable that Amelia should fall in love with it all, under the
circumstances; besides, she is largely influenced by what Césarine says, and Césarine declares
there is no climate in Europe like Meran in winter. I do not agree with her. The sun sets behind
the hills at three in the afternoon, and a nasty warm wind blows moist over the snow in January
and February.

However, Amelia set Césarine to inquire of the people at the hotel about the market price of
tumbledown ruins, and the number of such eligible family mausoleums just then for sale in the
immediate neighbourhood. Césarine returned with a full, true, and particular list, adorned
with flowers of rhetoric which would have delighted the soul of good old John Robins. They
were all picturesque, all Romanesque, all richly ivy-clad, all commodious, all historical,
and all the property of high well-born Grafs and very honourable Freiherrs. Most of them had
been the scene of celebrated tournaments; several of them had witnessed the gorgeous marriages
of Holy Roman Emperors; and every one of them was provided with some choice and selected first-class
murders. Ghosts could be arranged for or not, as desired; and armorial bearings could be thrown
in with the moat for a moderate extra remuneration.

The two we liked best of all these tempting piles were Schloss Planta and Schloss Lebenstein.
We drove past both, and even I myself, I confess, was distinctly taken with them. (Besides,
when a big purchase like this is on the stocks, a poor beggar of a secretary has always a chance
of exerting his influence and earning for himself some modest commission.) Schloss Planta was
the most striking externally, I should say, with its Rhine-like towers, and its great gnarled
ivy-stems, that looked as if they antedated the House of Hapsburg; but Lebenstein was said
to be better preserved within, and more fitted in every way for modern occupation. Its staircase
has been photographed by 7000 amateurs.

We got tickets to view. The invaluable Césarine procured them for us. Armed with these, we
drove off one fine afternoon, meaning to go to Planta, by Césarine's recommendation. Half-way
there, however, we changed our minds, as it was such a lovely day, and went on up the long,
slow hill to Lebenstein. I must say the drive through the grounds was simply charming. The
castle stands perched (say rather poised, like St. Michael the archangel in Italian pictures)
on a solitary stack or crag of rock, looking down on every side upon its own rich vineyards.
Chestnuts line the glens; the valley of the Etsch spreads below like a picture.

The vineyards alone make a splendid estate, by the way; they produce a delicious red wine,
which is exported to Bordeaux, and there bottled and sold as a vintage claret under the name
of Chateau Monnivet. Charles revelled in the idea of growing his own wines.

"Here we could sit," he cried to Amelia, "in the most literal sense, under our own vine and
fig-tree. Delicious retirement! For my part, I'm sick and tired of the hubbub of Threadneedle
Street."

We knocked at the door--for there was really no bell, but a ponderous, old-fashioned, wrought-iron
knocker. So deliciously mediæval! The late Graf von Lebenstein had recently died, we knew;
and his son, the present Count, a young man of means, having inherited from his mother's family
a still more ancient and splendid schloss in the Salzburg district, desired to sell this outlying
estate in order to afford himself a yacht, after the manner that is now becoming increasingly
fashionable with the noblemen and gentlemen in Germany and Austria.

The door was opened for us by a high well-born menial, attired in a very ancient and honourable
livery. Nice antique hall; suits of ancestral armour, trophies of Tyrolese hunters, coats of
arms of ancient counts--the very thing to take Amelia's aristocratic and romantic fancy. The
whole to be sold exactly as it stood; ancestors to be included at a valuation.

We went through the reception-rooms. They were lofty, charming, and with glorious views, all
the more glorious for being framed by those graceful Romanesque windows, with their slender
pillars and quaint, round-topped arches. Sir Charles had made his mind up. "I must and will
have it!" he cried. "This is the place for me. Seldon! Pah, Seldon is a modern abomination."

Could we see the high well-born Count? The liveried servant (somewhat haughtily) would inquire
of his Serenity. Sir Charles sent up his card, and also Lady Vandrift's. These foreigners know
title spells money in England.

He was right in his surmise. Two minutes later the Count entered with our cards in his hands.
A good-looking young man, with the characteristic Tyrolese long black moustache, dressed in
a gentlemanly variant on the costume of the country. His air was a jager's; the usual blackcock's
plume stuck jauntily in the side of the conical hat (which he held in his hand), after the
universal Austrian fashion.

He waved us to seats. We sat down. He spoke to us in French; his English, he remarked, with
a pleasant smile, being a négligeable quantity. We might speak it, he went on; he could understand
pretty well; but he preferred to answer, if we would allow him, in French or German.

"French," Charles replied, and the negotiation continued thenceforth in that language. It is
the only one, save English and his ancestral Dutch, with which my brother-in-law possesses
even a nodding acquaintance.

We praised the beautiful scene. The Count's face lighted up with patriotic pride. Yes; it was
beautiful, beautiful, his own green Tyrol. He was proud of it and attached to it. But he could
endure to sell this place, the home of his fathers, because he had a finer in the Salzkammergut,
and a pied-à-terre near Innsbruck. For Tyrol lacked just one joy--the sea. He was a passionate
yachtsman. For that he had resolved to sell this estate; after all, three country houses, a
ship, and a mansion in Vienna, are more than one man can comfortably inhabit.

"Exactly," Charles answered. "If I can come to terms with you about this charming estate I
shall sell my own castle in the Scotch Highlands." And he tried to look like a proud Scotch
chief who harangues his clansmen.

Then they got to business. The Count was a delightful man to do business with. His manners
were perfect. While we were talking to him, a surly person, a steward or bailiff, or something
of the sort, came into the room unexpectedly and addressed him in German, which none of us
understand. We were impressed by the singular urbanity and benignity of the nobleman's demeanour
towards this sullen dependant. He evidently explained to the fellow what sort of people we
were, and remonstrated with him in a very gentle way for interrupting us. The steward understood,
and clearly regretted his insolent air; for after a few sentences he went out, and as he did
so he bowed and made protestations of polite regard in his own language. The Count turned to
us and smiled. "Our people," he said, "are like your own Scotch peasants--kind-hearted, picturesque,
free, musical, poetic, but wanting, hélas, in polish to strangers." He was certainly an exception,
if he described them aright; for he made us feel at home from the moment we entered.

He named his price in frank terms. His lawyers at Meran held the needful documents, and would
arrange the negotiations in detail with us. It was a stiff sum, I must say--an extremely stiff
sum; but no doubt he was charging us a fancy price for a fancy castle. "He will come down in
time," Charles said. "The sum first named in all these transactions is invariably a feeler.
They know I'm a millionaire; and people always imagine millionaires are positively made of money."

I may add that people always imagine it must be easier to squeeze money out of millionaires
than out of other people--which is the reverse of the truth, or how could they ever have amassed
their millions? Instead of oozing gold as a tree oozes gum, they mop it up like blotting-paper,
and seldom give it out again.

We drove back from this first interview none the less very well satisfied. The price was too
high; but preliminaries were arranged, and for the rest, the Count desired us to discuss all
details with his lawyers in the chief street, Unter den Lauben. We inquired about these lawyers,
and found they were most respectable and respected men; they had done the family business on
either side for seven generations.

They showed us plans and title-deeds. Everything quite en régle. Till we came to the price
there was no hitch of any sort.

As to price, however, the lawyers were obdurate. They stuck out for the Count's first sum to
the uttermost florin. It was a very big estimate. We talked and shilly-shallied till Sir Charles
grew angry. He lost his temper at last.

"They know I'm a millionaire, Sey," he said, "and they're playing the old game of trying to
diddle me. But I won't be diddled. Except Colonel Clay, no man has ever yet succeeded in bleeding
me. And shall I let myself be bled as if I were a chamois among these innocent mountains? Mine man

 Therefore, as soon as my brother-in-law
had obtained this option from the native vendor (a most respected chief, by name Montsioa),
and promoted a company of his own to develop it, his great rival in that region, Lord Craig-Ellachie
(formerly Sir David Alexander Granton), immediately secured a similar option of an adjacent
track, the larger part of which had pretty much the same geological conditions as that covered
by Sir Charles's right of pre-emption.

We were not wholly disappointed, as it turned out, in the result. A month or two later, while
we were still at Seldon, we received a long and encouraging letter from our prospectors on
the spot, who had been hunting over the ground in search of gold-reefs. They reported that
they had found a good auriferous vein in a corner of the tract, approachable by adit-levels;
but, unfortunately, only a few yards of the lode lay within the limits of Sir Charles's area.
The remainder ran on at once into what was locally known as Craig-Ellachie's section.

However, our prospectors had been canny, they said; though young Mr. Granton was prospecting
at the same time, in the self-same ridge, not very far from them, his miners had failed to
discover the auriferous quartz; so our men had held their tongues about it, wisely leaving
it for Charles to govern himself accordingly.

"Can you dispute the boundary?" I asked.

"Impossible," Charles answered. "You see, the limit is a meridian of longitude. There's no
getting over that. Can't pretend to deny it. No buying over the sun! No bribing the instruments!
Besides, we drew the line ourselves. We've only one way out of it, Sey. Amalgamate! Amalgamate!"

Charles is a marvellous man! The very voice in which he murmured that blessed word "Amalgamate!"
was in itself a poem.

"Capital!" I answered. "Say nothing about it, and join forces with Craig-Ellachie."

Charles closed one eye pensively.

That very same evening came a telegram in cipher from our chief engineer on the territory of
the option: "Young Granton has somehow given us the slip and gone home. We suspect he knows
all. But we have not divulged the secret to anybody."

"Seymour," my brother-in-law said impressively, "there is no time to be lost. I must write
this evening to Sir David--I mean to My Lord. Do you happen to know where he is stopping at
present?"

"The Morning Post announced two or three days ago that he was at Glen-Ellachie," I answered.

"Then I'll ask him to come over and thrash the matter out with me," my brother-in-law went
on. "A very rich reef, they say. I must have my finger in it!"

We adjourned into the study, where Sir Charles drafted, I must admit, a most judicious letter
to the rival capitalist. He pointed out that the mineral resources of the country were probably
great, but as yet uncertain. That the expense of crushing and milling might be almost prohibitive.
That access to fuel was costly, and its conveyance difficult. That water was scarce, and commanded
by our section. That two rival companies, if they happened to hit upon ore, might cut one another's
throats by erecting two sets of furnaces or pumping plants, and bringing two separate streams
to the spot, where one would answer. In short--to employ the golden word--that amalgamation
might prove better in the end than competition; and that he advised, at least, a conference
on the subject.

I wrote it out fair for him, and Sir Charles, with the air of a Cromwell, signed it.

"This is important, Sey," he said. "It had better be registered, for fear of falling into improper
hands. Don't give it to Dobson; let Césarine take it over to Fowlis in the dog-cart."

It is the drawback of Seldon that we are twelve miles from a railway station, though we look
out on one of the loveliest firths in Scotland.

Césarine took it as directed--an invaluable servant, that girl! Meanwhile, we learned from
the Morning Post next day that young Mr. Granton had stolen a march upon us. He had arrived
from Africa by the same mail with our agent's letter, and had joined his father at once at
Glen-Ellachie.

Two days later we received a most polite reply from the opposing interest. It ran after this
fashion:--

"CRAIG-ELLACHIE LODGE,

"GLEN-ELLACHIE, INVERNESS-SHIRE.

"DEAR SIR CHARLES VANDRIFT--Thanks for yours of the 20th. In reply, I can only say I fully
reciprocate your amiable desire that nothing adverse to either of our companies should happen
in South Africa. With regard to your suggestion that we should meet in person, to discuss the
basis of a possible amalgamation, I can only say my house is at present full of guests--as
is doubtless your own--and I should therefore find it practically impossible to leave Glen-Ellachie.
Fortunately, however, my son David is now at home on a brief holiday from Kimberley; and it
will give him great pleasure to come over and hear what you have to say in favour of an arrangement
which certainly, on some grounds, seems to me desirable in the interests of both our concessions
alike. He will arrive to-morrow afternoon at Seldon, and he is authorised, in every respect,
to negotiate with full powers on behalf of myself and the other directors. With kindest regards
to your wife and sons, I remain, dear Sir Charles, yours faithfully,

"CRAIG-ELLACHIE."

"Cunning old fox!" Sir Charles exclaimed, with a sniff. "What's he up to now, I wonder? Seems
almost as anxious to amalgamate as we ourselves are, Sey." A sudden thought struck him. "Do
you know," he cried, looking up, "I really believe the same thing must have happened to both
our exploring parties. They must have found a reef that goes under our ground, and the wicked
old rascal wants to cheat us out of it!"

"As we want to cheat him," I ventured to interpose.

Charles looked at me fixedly. "Well, if so, we're both in luck," he murmured, after a pause;
"though we can only get to know the whereabouts of their find by joining hands with them and
showing them ours. Still, it's good business either way. But I shall be cautious--cautious."

"What a nuisance!" Amelia cried, when we told her of the incident. "I suppose I shall have
to put the man up for the night--a nasty, raw-boned, half-baked Scotchman, you may be certain."

On Wednesday afternoon, about three, young Granton arrived. He was a pleasant-featured, red-haired,
sandy-whiskered youth, not unlike his father; but, strange to say, he dropped in to call, instead
of bringing his luggage.

"Why, you're not going back to Glen-Ellachie to-night, surely?" Charles exclaimed, in amazement.
"Lady Vandrift will be so disappointed! Besides, this business can't be arranged between two
trains, do you think, Mr. Granton?"

Young Granton smiled. He had an agreeable smile--canny, yet open.

"Oh no," he said frankly. "I didn't mean to go back. I've put up at the inn. I have my wife
with me, you know--and, I wasn't invited."

Amelia was of opinion, when we told her this episode, that David Granton wouldn't stop at Seldon
because he was an Honourable. Isabel was of opinion he wouldn't stop because he had married
an unpresentable young woman somewhere out in South Africa. Charles was of opinion that, as
representative of the hostile interest, he put up at the inn, because it might tie his hands
in some way to be the guest of the chairman of the rival company. And I was of opinion that
he had heard of the castle, and knew it well by report as the dullest country-house to stay
at in Scotland.

However that may be, young Granton insisted on remaining at the Cromarty Arms, though he told
us his wife would be delighted to receive a call from Lady Vandrift and Mrs. Wentworth. So
we all returned with him to bring the Honourable Mrs. Granton up to tea at the Castle.

She was a nice little thing, very shy and timid, but by no means unpresentable, and an evident
lady. She giggled at the end of every sentence; and she was endowed with a slight squint, which
somehow seemed to point all her feeble sallies. She knew little outside South Africa; but of
that she talked prettily; and she won all our hearts, in spite of the cast in her eye, by her
unaffected simplicity.

Next morning Charles and I had a regular debate with young Granton about the rival options.
Our talk was of cyanide processes, reverberatories, pennyweights, water-jackets. But it dawned
upon us soon that, in spite of his red hair and his innocent manners, our friend, the Honourable
David Granton, knew a thing or two. Gradually and gracefully he let us see that Lord Craig-Ellachie
had sent him for the benefit of the company, but that he had come for the benefit of the Honourable
David Granton.

"I'm a younger son, Sir Charles," he said; "and therefore I have to feather my nest for myself.
I know the ground. My father will be guided implicitly by what I advise in the matter. We are
men of the world. Now, let's be business-like. You want to amalgamate. You wouldn't do that,
of course, if you didn't know of something to the advantage of my father's company--say, a
lode on our land--which you hope to secure for yourself by amalgamation. Very well; I can make
or mar your project. If you choose to render it worth my while, I'll induce my father and his
directors to amalgamate. If you don't, I won't. That's the long and the short of it!"

Charles looked at him admiringly.

"Young man," he said, "you're deep, very deep--for your age. Is this candour--or deception?
Do you mean what you say? Or do you know some reason why it suits your father's book to amalgamate
as well as it suits mine? And are you trying to keep it from me?" He fingered his chin. "If
I only knew that," he went on, "I should know how to deal with you."

Young Granton smiled again. "You're a financier, Sir Charles," he answered. "I wonder, at your
time of life, you should pause to ask another financier whether he's trying to fill his own
pocket--or his father's. Whatever is my father's goes to his eldest son--and I am his youngest."

"You are right as to general principles," Sir Charles replied, quite affectionately. "Most
sound and sensible. But how do I know you haven't bargained already in the same way with your
father? You may have settled with him, and be trying to diddle me."

The young man assumed a most candid air. "Look here," he said, leaning forward. "I offer you
this chance. Take it or leave it. Do you wish to purchase my aid for this amalgamation by a
moderate commission on the net value of my father's option to yourself--which I know approximately?"

"Say five per cent," I suggested, in a tentative voice, just to justify my presence.

He looked me through and through. "Ten is more usual," he answered, in a peculiar tone and
with a peculiar glance.

Great heavens, how I winced! I knew what his words meant. They were the very words I had said
myself to Colonel Clay, as the Count von Lebenstein, about the purchase-money of the schloss--and
in the very same accent. I saw through it all now. That beastly cheque! This was Colonel Clay;
and he was trying to buy up my silence and assistance by the threat of exposure!

My blood ran cold. I didn't know how to answer him. What happened at the rest of that interview
I really couldn't tell you. My brain reeled round. I heard just faint echoes of "fuel" and
"reduction works." What on earth was I to do? If I told Charles my suspicion--for it was only
a suspicion--the fellow might turn upon me and disclose the cheque, which would suffice to
ruin me. If I didn't, I ran a risk of being considered by Charles an accomplice and a confederate.

The interview was long. I hardly know how I struggled through it. At the end young Granton
went off, well satisfied, if it was young Granton; and Amelia invited him and his wife up to
dinner at the castle.

Whatever else they were, they were capital company. They stopped for three days more at the
Cromarty Arms. And Charles debated and discussed incessantly. He couldn't quite make up his
mind what to do in the affair; and I certainly couldn't help him. I never was placed in such
a fix in my life. I did my best to preserve a strict neutrality.

Young Granton, it turned out, was a most agreeable person; and so, in her way, was that timid,
unpretending South African wife of his. She was naively surprised Amelia had never met her
mamma at Durban. They both talked delightfully, and had lots of good stories--mostly with points
that told against the Craig-Ellachie people. Moreover, the Honourable David was a splendid
swimmer. He went out in a boat with us, and dived like a seal. He was burning to teach Charles
and myself to swim, when we told him we could neither of us take a single stroke; he said it
was an accomplishment incumbent upon every true Englishman. But Charles hates the water; while,
as for myself, I detest every known form of muscular exercise.

However, we consented that he should row us on the Firth, and made an appointment one day with
himself and his wife for four the next evening.

That night Charles came to me with a very grave face in my own bedroom. "Sey," he said, under
his breath, "have you observed? Have you watched? Have you any suspicions?"

I trembled violently. I felt all was up. "Suspicions of whom?" I asked. "Not surely of Simpson?"
(he was Sir Charles's valet).

My respected brother-in-law looked at me contemptuously.

"Sey," he said, "are you trying to take me in? No, not of Simpson: of these two young folks.
My own belief is--they're Colonel Clay and Madame Picardet."

"Impossible!" I cried.

He nodded. "I'm sure of it."

"How do you know?"

"Instinctively."

I seized his arm. "Charles," I said, imploring him, "do nothing rash. Remember how you exposed
yourself to the ridicule of fools over Dr. Polperro!"

"I've thought of that," he answered, "and I mean to ca' caller." (When in Scotland as laird
of Seldon, Charles loves both to dress and to speak the part thoroughly.) "First thing to-morrow
I shall telegraph over to inquire at Glen-Ellachie; I shall find out whether this is really
young Granton or not; meanwhile, I shall keep my eye close upon the fellow."

Early next morning, accordingly, a groom was dispatched with a telegram to Lord Craig-Ellachie.
He was to ride over to Fowlis, send it off at once, and wait for the answer. At the same time,
as it was probable Lord Craig-Ellachie would have started for the moors before the telegram
reached the Lodge, I did not myself expect to see the reply arrive much before seven or eight
that evening. Meanwhile, as it was far from certain we had not the real David Granton to deal
with, it was necessary to be polite to our friendly rivals. Our experience in the Polperro
incident had shown us both that too much zeal may be more dangerous than too little. Nevertheless,
taught by previous misfortunes, we kept watching our man pretty close, determined that on this
occasion, at least, he should neither do us nor yet escape us.

About four o'clock the red-haired young man and his pretty little wife came up to call for
us. She looked so charming and squinted so enchantingly, one could hardly believe she was not
as simple and innocent as she seemed to be. She tripped down to the Seldon boat-house, with
Charles by her side, giggling and squinting her best, and then helped her husband to get the
skiff ready. As she did so, Charles sidled up to me. "Sey," he whispered, "I'm an old hand,
and I'm not readily taken in. I've been talking to that girl, and upon my soul I think she's
all right. She's a charming little lady. We may be mistaken after all, of course, about young
Granton. In any case, it's well for the present to be courteous. A most important option! If
it's really he, we must do nothing to annoy him or let him see we suspect him."

I had noticed, indeed, that Mrs. Granton had made herself most agreeable to Charles from the
very beginning. And as to one thing he was right. In her timid, shrinking way she was undeniably
charming. That cast in her eye was all pure piquancy.

We rowed out on to the Firth, or, to be more strictly correct, the two Grantons rowed while
Charles and I sat and leaned back in the stern on the luxurious cushions. They rowed fast and
well. In a very few minutes they had rounded the point and got clear out of sight of the Cockneyfied
towers and false battlements of Seldon.

Mrs. Granton pulled stroke. Even as she rowed she kept up a brisk undercurrent of timid chaff
with Sir Charles, giggling all the while, half forward, half shy, like a school-girl who flirts
with a man old enough to be her grandfather.

Sir Charles was flattered. He is susceptible to the pleasures of female attention, especially
from the young, the simple, and the innocent. The wiles of women of the world he knows too
well; but a pretty little ingénue can twist him round her finger. They rowed on and on, till
they drew abreast of Seamew's island. It is a jagged stack or skerry, well out to sea, very
wild and precipitous on the landward side, but shelving gently outward; perhaps an acre in
extent, with steep gray cliffs, covered at that time with crimson masses of red valerian. Mrs.
Granton rowed up close to it. "Oh, what lovely flowers!" she cried, throwing her head back
and gazing at them. "I wish I could get some! Let's land here and pick them. Sir Charles, you
shall gather me a nice bunch for my sitting-room."

Charles rose to it innocently, like a trout to a fly.

"By all means, my dear child, I--I have a passion for flowers;" which was a flower of speech
itself, but it served its purpose.

They rowed us round to the far side, where is the easiest landing-place. It struck me as odd
at the moment that they seemed to know it. Then young Granton jumped lightly ashore; Mrs. Granton
skipped after him. I confess it made me feel rather ashamed to see how clumsily Charles and
I followed them, treading gingerly on the thwarts for fear of upsetting the boat, while the
artless young thing just flew over the gunwale. So like White Heather! However, we got ashore
at last in safety, and began to climb the rocks as well as we were able in search of the valerian.

Judge of our astonishment when next moment those two young people bounded back into the boat,
pushed off with a peal of merry laughter, and left us there staring at them!

They rowed away, about twenty yards, into deep water. Then the man turned, and waved his hand
at us gracefully. "Good-bye!" he said, "good-bye! Hope you'll pick a nice bunch! We're off
to London!"

"Off!" Charles exclaimed, turning pale. "Off! What do you mean? You don't surely mean to say
you're going to leave us here?"

The young man raised his cap with perfect politeness, while Mrs. Granton smiled, nodded, and
kissed her pretty hand to us. "Yes," he answered; "for the present. We retire from the game.
The fact of it is, it's a trifle too thin: this is a coup manqué."

"A what?" Charles exclaimed, perspiring visibly.

"A coup manqué," the young man replied, with a compassionate smile. "A failure, don't you know;
a bad shot; a fiasco. I learn from my scouts that you sent a telegram by special messenger
to Lord Craig-Ellachie this morning. That shows you suspect me. Now, it is a principle of my
system never to go on for one move with a game when I find myself suspected. The slightest
symptom of distrust, and--I back out immediately. My plans can only be worked to satisfaction
when there is perfect confidence on the part of my patient. It is a well-known rule of the
medical profession. I never try to bleed a man who struggles. So now we're off. Ta-ta! Good
luck to you!"

He was not much more than twenty yards away, and could talk to us quite easily. But the water
was deep; the islet rose sheer from I'm sure I don't know how many fathoms of sea; and we could
neither of us swim. Charles stretched out his arms imploringly. "For Heaven's sake," he cried,
"don't tell me you really mean to leave us here."

He looked so comical in his distress and terror that Mrs. Granton--Madame Picardet--whatever
I am to call her--laughed melodiously in her prettiest way at the sight of him. "Dear Sir Charles,"
she called out, "pray don't be afraid! It's only a short and temporary imprisonment. We will
send men to take you off. Dear David and I only need just time enough to get well ashore and
make--oh!--a few slight alterations in our personal appearance." And she indicated with her
hand, laughing, dear David's red wig and false sandy whiskers, as we felt convinced they must
be now. She looked at them and tittered. Her manner at this moment was anything but shy. In
fact, I will venture to say, it was that of a bold and brazen-faced hoyden.

"Then you are Colonel Clay!" Sir Charles cried, mopping his brow with his handkerchief.

"If you choose to call me so," the young man answered politely. "I'm sure it's most kind of
you to supply me with a commission in Her Majesty's service. However, time presses, and we
want to push off. Don't alarm yourselves unnecessarily. I will send a boat to take you away
from this rock at the earliest possible moment consistent with my personal safety and my dear
companion's." He laid his hand on his heart and struck a sentimental attitude. "I have received
too many unwilling kindnesses at your hands, Sir Charles," he continued, "not to feel how wrong
it would be of me to inconvenience you for nothing. Rest assured that you shall be rescued
by midnight at latest. Fortunately, the weather just at present is warm, and I see no chance
of rain; so you will suffer, if at all, from nothing worse than the pangs of temporary hunger."

Mrs. Granton, no longer squinting--'twas a mere trick she had assumed--rose up in the boat
and stretched out a rug to us. "Catch!" she cried, in a merry voice, and flung it at us, doubled.
It fell at our feet; she was a capital thrower.

"Now, you dear Sir Charles," she went on, "take that to keep you warm! You know I am really
quite fond of you. You're not half a bad old boy when one takes you the right way. You have
a human side to you. Why, I often wear that sweetly pretty brooch you gave me at Nice, when
I was Madame Picardet! And I'm sure your goodness to me at Lucerne, when I was the little curate's
wife, is a thing to remember. We're so glad to have seen you in your lovely Scotch home you
were always so proud of! Don't be frightened, please. We wouldn't hurt you for worlds. We are
so sorry we have to take this inhospitable means of evading you. But dear David--I must call
him dear David still--instinctively felt that you were beginning to suspect us; and he can't
bear mistrust. He is so sensitive! The moment people mistrust him, he must break off with them
at once. This was the only way to get you both off our hands while we make the needful little
arrangements to depart; and we've been driven to avail ourselves of it. However, I will give
you my word of honour, as a lady, you shall be fetched away to-night. If dear David doesn't
do it, why, I'll do it myself." And she blew another kiss to us.

Charles was half beside himself, divided between alternate terror and anger. "Oh, we shall
die here!" he exclaimed. "Nobody'd ever dream of coming to this rock to search for me."

"What a pity you didn't let me teach you to swim!" Colonel Clay interposed. "It is a noble
exercise, and very useful indeed in such special emergencies! Well, ta-ta! I'm off! You nearly
scored one this time; but, by putting you here for the moment, and keeping you till we're gone,
I venture to say I've redressed the board, and I think we may count it a drawn game, mayn't
we? The match stands at three, love--with some thousands in pocket?"

"You're a murderer, sir!" Charles shrieked out. "We shall starve or die here!"

Colonel Clay on his side was all sweet reasonableness. "Now, my dear sir," he expostulated,
one hand held palm outward, "Do you think it probable I would kill the goose that lays the
golden eggs, with so little compunction? No, no, Sir Charles Vandrift; I know too well how
much you are worth to me. I return you on my income-tax paper as five thousand a year, clear
profit of my profession. Suppose you were to die! I might be compelled to find some new and
far less lucrative source of plunder. Your heirs, executors, or assignees might not suit my
purpose. The fact of it is, sir, your temperament and mine are exactly adapted one to the other.
I understand you; and you do not understand me--which is often the basis of the firmest friendships.
I can catch you just where you are trying to catch other people. Your very smartness assists
me; for I admit you are smart. As a regular financier, I allow, I couldn't hold a candle to
you. But in my humbler walk of life I know just how to utilise you. I lead you on, where you
think you are going to gain some advantage over others; and by dexterously playing upon your
love of a good bargain, your innate desire to best somebody else--I succeed in besting you.
There, sir, you have the philosophy of our mutual relations."

He bowed and raised his cap. Charles looked at him and cowered. Yes, genius as he is, he positively
cowered. "And do you mean to say," he burst out, "you intend to go on so bleeding me?"

The Colonel smiled a bland smile. "Sir Charles Vandrift," he answered, "I called you just now
the goose that lays the golden eggs. You may have thought the metaphor a rude one. But you
are a goose, you know, in certain relations. Smartest man on the Stock Exchange, I readily
admit; easiest fool to bamboozle in the open country that ever I met with. You fail in one
thing--the perspicacity of simplicity. For that reason, among others, I have chosen to fasten
upon you. Regard me, my dear sir, as a microbe of millionaires, a parasite upon capitalists.
You know the old rhyme:

  Great fleas have little fleas upon their backs to bite 'em,
  And these again have lesser fleas, and so ad infinitum!

Well, that's just how I view myself. You are a capitalist and a millionaire. In your large
way you prey upon society. YOU deal in Corners, Options, Concessions, Syndicates. You drain
the world dry of its blood and its money. You possess, like the mosquito, a beautiful instrument
of suction--Founders' Shares--with which you absorb the surplus wealth of the community. In
my smaller way, again, I relieve you in turn of a portion of the plunder. I am a Robin Hood
of my age; and, looking upon you as an exceptionally bad form of millionaire--as well as an
exceptionally easy form of pigeon for a man of my type and talents to pluck--I have, so to
speak, taken up my abode upon you."

Charles looked at him and groaned.

The young man continued, in a tone of gentle badinage. "I love the plot-interest of the game,"
he said, "and so does dear Jessie here. We both of us adore it. As long as I find such good
pickings upon you, I certainly am not going to turn away from so valuable a carcass, in order
to batten myself, at considerable trouble, upon minor capitalists, out of whom it is difficult
to extract a few hundreds. It may have puzzled you to guess why I fix upon you so persistently.
Now you know, and understand. When a fluke finds a sheep that suits him, that fluke lives upon
him. You are my host: I am your parasite. This coup has failed. But don't flatter yourself
for a moment it will be the last one."

"Why do you insult me by telling me all this?" Sir Charles cried, writhing.

The Colonel waved his hand. It was small and white. "Because I love the game," he answered,
with a relish; "and also, because the more prepared you are beforehand, the greater credit
and amusement is there in besting you. Well, now, ta-ta once more! I am wasting valuable time.
I might be cheating somebody. I must be off at once.... Take care of yourself, Wentworth. But
I know you will. You always do. Ten per cent is more usual!"

He rowed away and left us. As the boat began to disappear round the corner of the island, White
Heather--so she looked--stood up in the stern and shouted aloud through her pretty hands to
us. "By-bye, dear Sir Charles!" she cried. "Do wrap the rug around you! I'll send the men to
fetch you as soon as ever I possibly can. And thank you so much for those lovely flowers!"

The boat rounded the crags. We were alone on the island. Charles flung himself on the bare
rock in a wild access of despondency. He is accustomed to luxury, and cannot get on without
his padded cushions. As for myself, I climbed with some difficulty to the top of the cliff,
landward, and tried to make signals of distress with my handkerchief to some passer-by on the
mainland. All in vain. Charles had dismissed the crofters on the estate; and, as the shooting-party
that day was in an opposite direction, not a soul was near to whom we could call for succour.

I climbed down again to Charles. The evening came on slowly. Cries of sea-birds rang weird
upon the water. Puffins and cormorants circled round our heads in the gray of twilight. Charles
suggested that they might even swoop down upon us and bite us. They did not, however, but their
flapping wings added none the less a painful touch of eeriness to our hunger and solitude.
Charles was horribly depressed. For myself, I will confess I felt so much relieved at the fact
that Colonel Clay had not openly betrayed me in the matter of the commission, as to be comparatively
comfortable.

We crouched on the hard crag. About eleven o'clock we heard human voices. "Boat ahoy!" I shouted.
An answering shout aroused us to action. We rushed down to the landing-place and cooee'd for
the men, to show them where we were. They came up at once in Sir Charles's own boat. They were
fishermen from Niggarey, on the shore of the Firth opposite.

A lady and gentleman had sent them, they said, to return the boat and call for us on the island;
their description corresponded to the two supposed Grantons. They rowed us home almost in silence
to Seldon. It was half-past twelve by the gatehouse clock when we reached the castle. Men had
been sent along the coast each way to seek us. Amelia had gone to bed, much alarmed for our
safety. Isabel was sitting up. It was too late, of course, to do much that night in the way
of apprehending the miscreants, though Charles insisted upon dispatching a groom, with a telegram
for the police at Inverness, to Fowlis.

Nothing came of it all. A message awaited us from Lord Craig-Ellachie, to be sure, saying that
his son had not left Glen-Ellachie Lodge; while research the next day and later showed that
our correspondent had never even received our letter. An empty envelope alone had arrived at
the house, and the postal authorities had been engaged meanwhile, with their usual lightning
speed, in "investigating the matter." Césarine had posted the letter herself at Fowlis, and
brought back the receipt; so the only conclusion we could draw was this--Colonel Clay must
be in league with somebody at the post-office. As for Lord Craig-Ellachie's reply, that was
a simple forgery; though, oddly enough, it was written on Glen-Ellachie paper.

However, by the time Charles had eaten a couple of grouse, and drunk a bottle of his excellent
Rudesheimer, his spirits and valour revived exceedingly. Doubtless he inherits from his Boer
ancestry a tendency towards courage of the Batavian description. He was in capital feather.

"After all, Sey," he said, leaning back in his chair, "this time we score one. He has not done
us brown; we have at least detected him. To detect him in time is half-way to catching him.
Only the remoteness of our position at Seldon Castle saved him from capture. Next set-to, I
feel sure, we will not merely spot him, we will also nab him. I only wish he would try on such
a rig in London."

But the oddest part of it all was this, that from the moment those two people landed at Niggarey,
and told the fishermen there were some gentlemen stranded on the Seamew's island, all trace
of them vanished. At no station along the line could we gain any news of them. Their maid had
left the inn the same morning with their luggage, and we tracked her to Inverness; but there
the trail stopped short, no spoor lay farther. It was a most singular and insoluble mystery.

Charles lived in hopes of catching his man in London.

But for my part, I felt there was a show of reason in one last taunt which the rascal flung
back at us as the boat receded: "Sir Charles Vandrift, we are a pair of rogues. The law protects
you. It persecutes me. That's all the difference."

VI

THE EPISODE OF THE GERMAN PROFESSOR

That winter in town my respected brother-in-law had little time on his hands to bother himself
about trifles like Colonel Clay. A thunderclap burst upon him. He saw his chief interest in
South Africa threatened by a serious, an unexpected, and a crushing danger.

Charles does a little in gold, and a little in land; but his principal operations have always
lain in the direction of diamonds.

He rubbed his hands at once and murmured enthusiastically, "I never thought of that. We might
get up an Atlantic Exploration Syndicate, Limited." So attached is he to diamonds. You may
gather, therefore, what a shock it was to that gigantic brain to learn that science was rapidly
reaching a point where his favourite gems might become all at once a mere drug in the market.
Depreciation is the one bugbear that perpetually torments Sir Charles's soul; that winter he
stood within measurable distance of so appalling a calamity.

It happened after this manner.

We were strolling along Piccadilly towards Charles's club one afternoon--he is a prominent
member of the Croesus, in Pall Mall--when, near Burlington House, whom should we happen to
knock up against but Sir Adolphus Cordery, the famous mineralogist, and leading spirit of the
Royal Society! He nodded to us pleasantly. "Halloa, Vandrift," he cried, in his peculiarly
loud and piercing voice; "you're the very man I wanted to meet to-day. Good morning, Wentworth.
Well, how about diamonds now, Sir Gorgius? You'll have to sing small. It's all up with you
Midases. Heard about this marvellous new discovery of Schleiermacher's? It's calculated to
make you diamond kings squirm like an eel in a frying-pan."

I could see Charles wriggle inside his clothes. He was most uncomfortable. That a man like
Cordery should say such things, in so loud a voice, on no matter how little foundation, openly
in Piccadilly, was enough in itself to make a sensitive barometer such as Cloetedorp Golcondas
go down a point or two.

"Hush, hush!" Charles said solemnly, in that awed tone of voice which he always assumes when
Money is blasphemed against. "Please don't talk quite so loud! All London can hear you."

Sir Adolphus ran his arm through Charles's most amicably. There's nothing Charles hates like
having his arm taken.

"Come along with me to the Athenæum," he went on, in the same stentorian voice, "and I'll tell
you all about it. Most interesting discovery. Makes diamonds cheap as dirt. Calculated to supersede
South Africa altogether."

Charles allowed himself to be dragged along. There was nothing else possible. Sir Adolphus
continued, in a somewhat lower key, induced upon him by Charles's mute look of protest. It
was a disquieting story. He told it with gleeful unction. It seems that Professor Schleiermacher,
of Jena, "the greatest living authority on the chemistry of gems," he said, had lately invented,
or claimed to have invented, a system for artificially producing diamonds, which had yielded
most surprising and unexceptionable results.

Charles's lip curled slightly. "Oh, I know the sort of thing," he said. "I've heard of it before.
Very inferior stones, quite small and worthless, produced at immense cost, and even then not
worth looking at. I'm an old bird, you know, Cordery; not to be caught with chaff. Tell me
a better one!"

Sir Adolphus produced a small cut gem from his pocket. "How's that for the first water?" he
inquired, passing it across, with a broad smile, to the sceptic. "Made under my own eyes--and
quite inexpensively!"

Charles examined it close, stopping short against the railings in St. James's Square to look
at it with his pocket-lens. There was no denying the truth. It was a capital small gem of the
finest quality.

"Made under your own eyes?" he exclaimed, still incredulous. "Where, my dear sir?--at Jena?"

The answer was a thunderbolt from a blue sky. "No, here in London; last night as ever was;
before myself and Dr. Gray; and about to be exhibited by the President himself at a meeting
of Fellows of the Royal Society."

Charles drew a long breath. "This nonsense must be stopped," he said firmly--"it must be nipped
in the bud. It won't do, my dear friend; we can't have such tampering with important Interests."

"How do you mean?" Cordery asked, astonished.

Charles gazed at him steadily. I could see by the furtive gleam in my brother-in-law's eye
he was distinctly frightened. "Where is the fellow?" he asked. "Did he come himself, or send
over a deputy?"

"Here in London," Sir Adolphus replied. "He's staying at my house; and he says he'll be glad
to show his experiments to anybody scientifically interested in diamonds. We propose to have
a demonstration of the process to-night at Lancaster Gate. Will you drop in and see it?"

Would he "drop in" and see it? "Drop in" at such a function! Could he possibly stop away? Charles
clutched the enemy's arm with a nervous grip. "Look here, Cordery," he said, quivering; "this
is a question affecting very important Interests. Don't do anything rash. Don't do anything
foolish. Remember that Shares may rise or fall on this." He said "Shares" in a tone of profound
respect that I can hardly even indicate. It was the crucial word in the creed of his religion.

"I should think it very probable," Sir Adolphus replied, with the callous indifference of the
mere man of science to financial suffering.

Sir Charles was bland, but peremptory. "Now, observe," he said, "a grave responsibility rests
on your shoulders. The Market depends upon you. You must not ask in any number of outsiders
to witness these experiments. Have a few mineralogists and experts, if you like; but also take
care to invite representatives of the menaced Interests. I will come myself--I'm engaged to
dine out, but I can contract an indisposition; and I should advise you to ask Mosenheimer,
and, say, young Phipson. They would stand for the mines, as you and the mineralogists would
stand for science. Above all, don't blab; for Heaven's sake, let there be no premature gossip.
Tell Schleiermacher not to go gassing and boasting of his success all over London."

"We are keeping the matter a profound secret, at Schleiermacher's own request," Cordery answered,
more seriously.

"Which is why," Charles said, in his severest tone, "you bawled it out at the very top of your
voice in Piccadilly!"

However, before nightfall, everything was arranged to Charles's satisfaction; and off we went
to Lancaster Gate, with a profound expectation that the German professor would do nothing worth
seeing.

He was a remarkable-looking man, once tall, I should say, from his long, thin build, but now
bowed and bent with long devotion to study and leaning over a crucible. His hair, prematurely
white, hung down upon his forehead, but his eye was keen and his mouth sagacious. He shook
hands cordially with the men of science, whom he seemed to know of old, whilst he bowed somewhat
distantly to the South African interest. Then he began to talk, in very German-English, helping
out the sense now and again, where his vocabulary failed him, by waving his rather dirty and
chemical-stained hands demonstratively about him. His nails were a sight, but his fingers,
I must say, had the delicate shape of a man's accustomed to minute manipulation. He plunged
at once into the thick of the matter, telling us briefly in his equally thick accent that he
"now brobosed by his new brocess to make for us some goot and sadisfactory tiamonds."

He brought out his apparatus, and explained--or, as he said, "eggsblained"--his novel method.
"Tiamonds," he said, "were nozzing but pure crystalline carbon." He knew how to crystallise
it--"zat was all ze secret." The men of science examined the pots and pans carefully. Then
he put in a certain number of raw materials, and went to work with ostentatious openness. There
were three distinct processes, and he made two stones by each simultaneously. The remarkable
part of his methods, he said, was their rapidity and their cheapness. In three-quarters of
an hour (and he smiled sardonically) he could produce a diamond worth at current prices two
hundred pounds sterling. "As you shall now see me berform," he remarked, "viz zis simple abbaradus."

The materials fizzed and fumed. The Professor stirred them. An unpleasant smell like burnt
feathers pervaded the room. The scientific men craned their necks in their eagerness, and looked
over one another; Vane-Vivian, in particular, was all attention. After three-quarters of an
hour, the Professor, still smiling, began to empty the apparatus. He removed a large quantity
of dust or powder, which he succinctly described as "by-broducts," and then took between finger
and thumb from the midst of each pan a small white pebble, not water-worn apparently, but slightly
rough and wart-like on the surface.

From one pair of the pannikins he produced two such stones, and held them up before us triumphantly.
"Zese," he said, "are genuine tiamonds, manufactured at a gost of fourteen shillings and siggspence
abiece!" Then he tried the second pair. "Zese," he said, still more gleefully, "are broduced
at a gost of eleffen and ninebence!" Finally, he came to the third pair, which he positively
brandished before our astonished eyes. "And zese," he cried, transported, "haff gost me no
more zan tree and eightbence!"

They were handed round for inspection. Rough and uncut as they stood, it was, of course, impossible
to judge of their value. But one thing was certain. The men of science had been watching close
at the first, and were sure Herr Schleiermacher had not put the stones in; they were keen at
the withdrawal, and were equally sure he had taken them honestly out of the pannikins.

"I vill now disdribute zem," the Professor remarked in a casual tone, as if diamonds were peas,
looking round at the company. And he singled out my brother-in-law. "One to Sir Charles!" he
said, handing it; "one to Mr. Mosenheimer; one to Mr. Phibson--as representing the tiamond
interest. Zen, one each to Sir Atolphus, to Dr. Gray, to Mr. Fane-Fiffian, as representing
science. You will haff zem cut and rebort upon zem in due gourse. We meet again at zis blace
ze day afder do-morrow."

Charles gazed at him reproachfully. The profoundest chords of his moral nature were stirred.
"Professor," he said, in a voice of solemn warning, "Are you aware that, if you have succeeded,
you have destroyed the value of thousands of pounds' worth of precious property?"

The Professor shrugged his shoulders. "Fot is dat to me?" he inquired, with a curious glance
of contempt. "I am not a financier! I am a man of science. I seek to know; I do not seek to
make a fortune."

"Shocking!" Charles exclaimed. "Shocking! I never before in my life beheld so strange an instance
of complete insensibility to the claims of others!"

We separated early. The men of science were coarsely jubilant. The diamond interest exhibited
a corresponding depression. If this news were true, they foresaw a slump. Every eye grew dim.
It was a terrible business.

Charles walked homeward with the Professor. He sounded him gently as to the sum required, should
need arise, to purchase his secrecy. Already Sir Adolphus had bound us all down to temporary
silence--as if that were necessary; but Charles wished to know how much Schleiermacher would
take to suppress his discovery. The German was immovable.

"No, no!" he replied, with positive petulance. "You do not unterstant. I do not buy and sell.
Zis is a chemical fact. We must bublish it for the sake off its seoretical falue. I do not
care for wealse. I haff no time to waste in making money."

"What an awful picture of a misspent life!" Charles observed to me afterwards.

And, indeed, the man seemed to care for nothing on earth but the abstract question--not whether
he could make good diamonds or not, but whether he could or could not produce a crystalline
form of pure carbon!

On the appointed night Charles went back to Lancaster Gate, as I could not fail to remark,
with a strange air of complete and painful preoccupation. Never before in his life had I seen
him so anxious.

The diamonds were produced, with one surface of each slightly scored by the cutters, so as
to show the water. Then a curious result disclosed itself. Strange to say, each of the three
diamonds given to the three diamond kings turned out to be a most inferior and valueless stone;
while each of the three intrusted to the care of the scientific investigators turned out to
be a fine gem of the purest quality.

I confess it was a sufficiently suspicious conjunction. The three representatives of the diamond
interest gazed at each other with inquiring side-glances. Then their eyes fell suddenly: they
avoided one another. Had each independently substituted a weak and inferior natural stone for
Professor Schleiermacher's manufactured pebbles? It almost seemed so. For a moment, I admit,
I was half inclined to suppose it. But next second I changed my mind. Could a man of Sir Charles
Vandrift's integrity and high principle stoop for lucre's sake to so mean an expedient?--not
to mention the fact that, even if he did, and if Mosenheimer did likewise, the stones submitted
to the scientific men would have amply sufficed to establish the reality and success of the
experiments!

Still, I must say, Charles looked guiltily across at Mosenheimer, and Mosenheimer at Phipson,
while three more uncomfortable or unhappy-faced men could hardly have been found at that precise
minute in the City of Westminster.

Then Sir Adolphus spoke--or, rather, he orated. He said, in his loud and grating voice, we
had that evening, and on a previous evening, been present at the conception and birth of an
Epoch in the History of Science. Professor Schleiermacher was one of those men of whom his
native Saxony might well be proud; while as a Briton he must say he regretted somewhat that
this discovery, like so many others, should have been "Made in Germany." However, Professor
Schleiermacher was a specimen of that noble type of scientific men to whom gold was merely
the rare metal Au, and diamonds merely the element C in the scarcest of its manifold allotropic
embodiments. The Professor did not seek to make money out of his discovery. He rose above the
sordid greed of capitalists. Content with the glory of having traced the element C to its crystalline
origin, he asked no more than the approval of science. However, out of deference to the wishes
of those financial gentlemen who were oddly concerned in maintaining the present price of C
in its crystalline form--in other words, the diamond interest--they had arranged that the secret
should be strictly guarded and kept for the present; not one of the few persons admitted to
the experiments would publicly divulge the truth about them. This secrecy would be maintained
till he himself, and a small committee of the Royal Society, should have time to investigate
and verify for themselves the Professor's beautiful and ingenious processes--an investigation
and verification which the learned Professor himself both desired and suggested. (Schleiermacher
nodded approval.) When that was done, if the process stood the test, further concealment would
be absolutely futile. The price of diamonds must fall at once below that of paste, and any
protest on the part of the financial world would, of course, be useless. The laws of Nature
were superior to millionaires. Meanwhile, in deference to the opinion of Sir Charles Vandrift,
whose acquaintance with that fascinating side of the subject nobody could deny, they had consented
to send no notices to the Press, and to abstain from saying anything about this beautiful and
simple process in public. He dwelt with horrid gusto on that epithet "beautiful." And now,
in the name of British mineralogy, he must congratulate Professor Schleiermacher, our distinguished
guest, on his truly brilliant and crystalline contribution to our knowledge of brilliants and
of crystalline science.

Everybody applauded. It was an awkward moment. Sir Charles bit his lip. Mosenheimer looked
glum. Young Phipson dropped an expression which I will not transcribe. (I understand this work
may circulate among families.) And after a solemn promise of death-like secrecy, the meeting
separated.

I noticed that my brother-in-law somewhat ostentatiously avoided Mosenheimer at the door; and
that Phipson jumped quickly into his own carriage. "Home!" Charles cried gloomily to the coachman
as we took our seats in the brougham. And all the way to Mayfair he leaned back in his seat,
with close-set lips, never uttering a syllable.

Before he retired to rest, however, in the privacy of the billiard-room, I ventured to ask
him: "Charles, will you unload Golcondas to-morrow?" Which, I need hardly explain, is the slang
of the Stock Exchange for getting rid of undesirable securities. It struck me as probable that,
in the event of the invention turning out a reality, Cloetedorp A's might become unsaleable
within the next few weeks or so.

He eyed me sternly. "Wentworth," he said, "you're a fool!" (Except on occasions when he is
very angry, my respected connection never calls me "Wentworth"; the familiar abbreviation,
"Sey"--derived from Seymour--is his usual mode of address to me in private.) "Is it likely
I would unload, and wreck the confidence of the public in the Cloetedorp Company at such a
moment? As a director--as Chairman--would it be just or right of me? I ask you, sir, could
I reconcile it to my conscience?"

"Charles," I answered, "you are right. Your conduct is noble. You will not save your own personal
interests at the expense of those who have put their trust in you. Such probity is, alas! very
rare in finance!" And I sighed involuntarily; for I had lost in Liberators.

At the same time I thought to myself, "I am not a director. No trust is reposed in me. I have
to think first of dear Isabel and the baby. Before the crash comes I will sell out to-morrow
the few shares I hold, through Charles's kindness, in the Cloetedorp Golcondas."

With his marvellous business instinct, Charles seemed to divine my thought, for he turned round
to me sharply. "Look here, Sey," he remarked, in an acidulous tone, "recollect, you're my brother-in-law.
You are also my secretary. The eyes of London will be upon us to-morrow. If you were to sell
out, and operators got to know of it, they'd suspect there was something up, and the company
would suffer for it. Of course, you can do what you like with your own property. I can't interfere
with that. I do not dictate to you. But as Chairman of the Golcondas, I am bound to see that
the interests of widows and orphans whose All is invested with me should not suffer at this
crisis." His voice seemed to falter. "Therefore, though I don't like to threaten," he went
on, "I am bound to give you warning: if you sell out those shares of yours, openly or secretly,
you are no longer my secretary; you receive forthwith six months' salary in lieu of notice,
and--you leave me instantly."

"Very well, Charles," I answered, in a submissive voice; though I debated with myself for a
moment whether it would be best to stick to the ready money and quit the sinking ship, or to
hold fast by my friend, and back Charles's luck against the Professor's science. After a short,
sharp struggle within my own mind, I am proud to say, friendship and gratitude won. I felt
sure that, whether diamonds went up or down, Charles Vandrift was the sort of man who would
come to the top in the end in spite of everything. And I decided to stand by him!

I slept little that night, however. My mind was a whirlwind. At breakfast Charles also looked
haggard and moody. He ordered the carriage early, and drove straight into the City.

There was a block in Cheapside. Charles, impatient and nervous, jumped out and walked. I walked
beside him. Near Wood Street a man we knew casually stopped us.

"I think I ought to mention to you," he said, confidentially, "that I have it on the very best
authority that Schleiermacher, of Jena--"

"Thank you," Charles said, crustily, "I know that tale, and--there's not a word of truth in it."

He brushed on in haste. A yard or two farther a broker paused in front of us.

"Halloa, Sir Charles!" he called out, in a bantering tone. "What's all this about diamonds?
Where are Cloetedorps to-day? Is it Golconda, or Queer Street?"

Charles drew himself up very stiff. "I fail to understand you," he answered, with dignity.

"Why, you were there yourself," the man cried. "Last night at Sir Adolphus's! Oh yes, it's
all over the place; Schleiermacher of Jena has succeeded in making the most perfect diamonds--for
sixpence apiece--as good as real--and South Africa's ancient history. In less than six weeks
Kimberley, they say, will be a howling desert. Every costermonger in Whitechapel will wear
genuine Koh-i-noors for buttons on his coat; every girl in Bermondsey will sport a rivière
like Lady Vandrift's to her favourite music-hall. There's a slump in Golcondas. Sly, sly, I
can see; but we know all about it!"

Charles moved on, disgusted. The man's manners were atrocious. Near the Bank we ran up against
a most respectable jobber.

"Ah, Sir Charles," he said; "you here? Well, this is strange news, isn't it? For my part, I
advise you not to take it too seriously. Your stock will go down, of course, like lead this
morning. But it'll rise to-morrow, mark my words, and fluctuate every hour till the discovery's
proved or disproved for certain. There's a fine time coming for operators, I feel sure. Reports
this way and that. Rumours, rumours, rumours. And nobody will know which way to believe till
Sir Adolphus has tested it."

We moved on towards the House. Black care was seated on Sir Charles's shoulders. As we drew
nearer and nearer, everybody was discussing the one fact of the moment. The seal of secrecy
had proved more potent than publication on the housetops. Some people told us of the exciting
news in confidential whispers; some proclaimed it aloud in vulgar exultation. The general opinion
was that Cloetedorps were doomed, and that the sooner a man cleared out the less was he likely
to lose by it.

Charles strode on like a general; but it was a Napoleon brazening out his retreat from Moscow.
His mien was resolute. He disappeared at last into the precincts of an office, waving me back,
not to follow. After a long consultation he came out and rejoined me.

All day long the City rang with Golcondas, Golcondas. Everybody murmured, "Slump, slump in
Golcondas." The brokers had more business to do than they could manage; though, to be sure,
almost every one was a seller and no one a buyer. But Charles stood firm as a rock, and so
did his brokers. "I don't want to sell," he said, doggedly. "The whole thing is trumped up.
It's a mere piece of jugglery. For my own part, I believe Professor Schleiermacher is deceived,
or else is deceiving us. In another week the bubble will have burst, and prices will restore
themselves." His brokers, Finglemores, had only one answer to all inquiries: "Sir Charles has
every confidence in the stability of Golcondas, and doesn't wish to sell or to increase the panic."

All the world said he was splendid, splendid! There he stationed himself on 'Change like some
granite stack against which the waves roll and break themselves in vain. He took no notice
of the slump, but ostentatiously bought up a few shares here and there so as to restore public
confidence.

"I would buy more," he said, freely, "and make my fortune; only, as I was one of those who
happened to spend last night at Sir Adolphus's, people might think I had helped to spread the
rumour and produce the slump, in order to buy in at panic rates for my own advantage. A chairman,
like Caesar's wife, should be above suspicion. So I shall only buy up just enough, now and
again, to let people see I, at least, have no doubt as to the firm future of Cloetedorps."

He went home that night, more harassed and ill than I have ever seen him. Next day was as bad.
The slump continued, with varying episodes. Now, a rumour would surge up that Sir Adolphus
had declared the whole affair a sham, and prices would steady a little; now, another would
break out that the diamonds were actually being put upon the market in Berlin by the cart-load,
and timid old ladies would wire down to their brokers to realise off-hand at whatever hazard.
It was an awful day. I shall never forget it.

The morning after, as if by miracle, things righted themselves of a sudden. While we were wondering
what it meant, Charles received a telegram from Sir Adolphus Cordery:--

"The man is a fraud. Not Schleiermacher at all. Just had a wire from Jena saying the Professor
knows nothing about him. Sorry unintentionally to have caused you trouble. Come round and see me."

"Sorry unintentionally to have caused you trouble." Charles was beside himself with anger.
Sir Adolphus had upset the share-market for forty-eight mortal hours, half-ruined a round dozen
of wealthy operators, convulsed the City, upheaved the House, and now--he apologised for it
as one might apologise for being late ten minutes for dinner! Charles jumped into a hansom
and rushed round to see him. How had he dared to introduce the impostor to solid men as Professor
Schleiermacher? Sir Adolphus shrugged his shoulders. The fellow had come and introduced himself
as the great Jena chemist; he had long white hair, and a stoop in the shoulders. What reason
had he for doubting his word? (I reflected to myself that on much the same grounds Charles
in turn had accepted the Honourable David Granton and Graf von Lebenstein.) Besides, what object
could the creature have for this extraordinary deception? Charles knew only too well. It was
clear it was done to disturb the diamond market, and we realised, too late, that the man who
had done it was--Colonel Clay, in "another of his manifold allotropic embodiments!" Charles
had had his wish, and had met his enemy once more in London!

We could see the whole plot. Colonel Clay was polymorphic, like the element carbon! Doubtless,
with his extraordinary sleight of hand, he had substituted real diamonds for the shapeless
mass that came out of the apparatus, in the interval between handing the pebbles round for
inspection, and distributing them piecemeal to the men of science and representatives of the
diamond interest. We all watched him closely, of course, when he opened the crucibles; but
when once we had satisfied ourselves that something came out, our doubts were set at rest,
and we forgot to watch whether he distributed those somethings or not to the recipients. Conjurers
always depend upon such momentary distractions or lapses of attention. As usual, too, the Professor
had disappeared into space the moment his trick was once well performed. He vanished like smoke,
as the Count and Seer had vanished before, and was never again heard of.

Charles went home more angry than I have ever beheld him. I couldn't imagine why. He seemed
as deeply hipped as if he had lost his thousands. I endeavoured to console him. "After all,"
I said, "though Golcondas have suffered a temporary loss, it's a comfort to think that you
should have stood so firm, and not only stemmed the tide, but also prevented yourself from
losing anything at all of your own through panic. I'm sorry, of course, for the widows and
orphans; but if Colonel Clay has rigged the market, at least it isn't YOU who lose by it this
time."

Charles withered me with a fierce scowl of undisguised contempt. "Wentworth," he said once
more, "you are a fool!" Then he relapsed into silence.

"But you declined to sell out," I said.

He gazed at me fixedly. "Is it likely," he asked at last, "I would tell you if I meant to sell
out? or that I'd sell out openly through Finglemore, my usual broker? Why, all the world would
have known, and Golcondas would have been finished. As it is, I don't desire to tell an ass
like you exactly how much I've lost. But I did sell out, and some unknown operator bought in
at once, and closed for ready money, and has sold again this morning; and after all that has
happened, it will be impossible to track him. He didn't wait for the account: he settled up
instantly. And he sold in like manner. I know now what has been done, and how cleverly it has
all been disguised and covered; but the most I'm going to tell you to-day is just this--it's
by far the biggest haul Colonel Clay has made out of me. He could retire on it if he liked.
My one hope is, it may satisfy him for life; but, then, no man has ever had enough of making
money."

"You sold out!" I exclaimed. "You, the Chairman of the company! You deserted the ship! And
how about your trust? How about the widows and orphans confided to you?"

Charles rose and faced me. "Seymour Wentworth," he said, in his most solemn voice, "you have
lived with me for years and had every advantage. You have seen high finance. Yet you ask me
that question! It's my belief you will never, never understand business!"

VII

THE EPISODE OF THE ARREST OF THE COLONEL

How much precisely Charles dropped over the slump in Cloetedorps I never quite knew. But the
incident left him dejected, limp, and dispirited.

"Hang it all, Sey," he said to me in the smoking-room, a few evenings later. "This Colonel
Clay is enough to vex the patience of Job--and Job had large losses, too, if I recollect aright,
from the Chaldeans and other big operators of the period."

"Three thousand camels," I murmured, recalling my dear mother's lessons; "all at one fell swoop;
not to mention five hundred yoke of oxen, carried off by the Sabeans, then a leading firm of
speculative cattle-dealers!"

"Ah, well," Charles meditated aloud, shaking the ash from his cheroot into a Japanese tray--fine
antique bronze-work. "There were big transactions in live-stock even then! Still, Job or no
Job, the man is too much for me."

"The difficulty is," I assented, "you never know where to have him."

"Yes," Charles mused; "if he were always the same, like Horniman's tea or a good brand of whisky,
it would be easier, of course; you'd stand some chance of spotting him. But when a man turns
up smiling every time in a different disguise, which fits him like a skin, and always apparently
with the best credentials, why, hang it all, Sey, there's no wrestling with him anyhow."

"Who could have come to us, for example, better vouched," I acquiesced, "than the Honourable
David?"

"Exactly so," Charles murmured. "I invited him myself, for my own advantage. And he arrived
with all the prestige of the Glen-Ellachie connection."

"Or the Professor?" I went on. "Introduced to us by the leading mineralogist of England."

I had touched a sore point. Charles winced and remained silent.

"Then, women again," he resumed, after a painful pause. "I must meet in society many charming
women. I can't everywhere and always be on my guard against every dear soul of them. Yet the
moment I relax my attention for one day--or even when I don't relax it--I am bamboozled and
led a dance by that arch Mme. Picardet, or that transparently simple little minx, Mrs. Granton.
She's the cleverest girl I ever met in my life, that hussy, whatever we're to call her. She's
a different person each time; and each time, hang it all, I lose my heart afresh to that different
person."

I glanced round to make sure Amelia was well out of earshot.

"No, Sey," my respected connection went on, after another long pause, sipping his coffee pensively,
"I feel I must be aided in this superhuman task by a professional unraveller of cunning disguises.
I shall go to Marvillier's to-morrow--fortunate man, Marvillier--and ask him to supply me with
a really good 'tec, who will stop in the house and keep an eye upon every living soul that
comes near me. He shall scan each nose, each eye, each wig, each whisker. He shall be my watchful
half, my unsleeping self; it shall be his business to suspect all living men, all breathing
women. The Archbishop of Canterbury shall not escape for a moment his watchful regard; he will
take care that royal princesses don't collar the spoons or walk off with the jewel-cases. He
must see possible Colonel Clays in the guard of every train and the parson of every parish;
he must detect the off-chance of a Mme. Picardet in every young girl that takes tea with Amelia,
every fat old lady that comes to call upon Isabel. Yes, I have made my mind up. I shall go
to-morrow and secure such a man at once at Marvillier's."

"If you please, Sir Charles," Césarine interposed, pushing her head through the portière, "her
ladyship says, will you and Mr. Wentworth remember that she goes out with you both this evening
to Lady Carisbrooke's?"

"Bless my soul," Charles cried, "so she does! And it's now past ten! The carriage will be at
the door for us in another five minutes!"

Next morning, accordingly, Charles drove round to Marvillier's. The famous detective listened
to his story with glistening eyes; then he rubbed his hands and purred. "Colonel Clay!" he
said; "Colonel Clay! That's a very tough customer! The police of Europe are on the look-out
for Colonel Clay. He is wanted in London, in Paris, in Berlin. It is le Colonel Caoutchouc
here, le Colonel Caoutchouc there; till one begins to ask, at last, IS there any Colonel Caoutchouc,
or is it a convenient class name invented by the Force to cover a gang of undiscovered sharpers?
However, Sir Charles, we will do our best. I will set on the track without delay the best and
cleverest detective in England."

"The very man I want," Charles said. "What name, Marvillier?"

The principal smiled. "Whatever name you like," he said. "He isn't particular. Medhurst he's
called at home. We call him Joe. I'll send him round to your house this afternoon for certain."

"Oh no," Charles said promptly, "you won't; or Colonel Clay himself will come instead of him.
I've been sold too often. No casual strangers! I'll wait here and see him."

"But he isn't in," Marvillier objected.

Charles was firm as a rock. "Then send and fetch him."

In half an hour, sure enough, the detective arrived. He was an odd-looking small man, with
hair cut short and standing straight up all over his head, like a Parisian waiter. He had quick,
sharp eyes, very much like a ferret's; his nose was depressed, his lips thin and bloodless.
A scar marked his left cheek--made by a sword-cut, he said, when engaged one day in arresting
a desperate French smuggler, disguised as an officer of Chasseurs d'Afrique. His mien was resolute.
Altogether, a quainter or 'cuter little man it has never yet been my lot to set eyes on. He
walked in with a brisk step, eyed Charles up and down, and then, without much formality, asked
for what he was wanted.

"This is Sir Charles Vandrift, the great diamond king," Marvillier said, introducing us.

"So I see," the man answered.

"Then you know me?" Charles asked.

"I wouldn't be worth much," the detective replied, "if I didn't know everybody. And you're
easy enough to know; why, every boy in the street knows you."

"Plain spoken!" Charles remarked.

"As you like it, sir," the man answered in a respectful tone. "I endeavour to suit my dress
and behaviour on every occasion to the taste of my employers."

"Your name?" Charles asked, smiling.

"Joseph Medhurst, at your service. What sort of work? Stolen diamonds? Illicit diamond-buying?"

"No," Charles answered, fixing him with his eye. "Quite another kind of job. You've heard of
Colonel Clay?"

Medhurst nodded. "Why, certainly," he said; and, for the first time, I detected a lingering

Though, poor little woman, I think he might have left her."

"Does a Mme. Picardet stop here?" I inquired of the landlord, thinking it possible she might
have assumed again the same old alias.

He nodded assent. "Oui, oui, oui," he answered. "She has just driven off, and monsieur your
friend has gone posting after her."

"Splendid man!" Charles cried. "Marvillier was quite right. He is the prince of detectives!"

We hailed a couple of fiacres, and drove off, in two detachments, to the juge d'instruction.
There Colonel Clay continued to brazen it out, and asserted that he was an officer in the Indian
Army, home on six months' leave, and spending some weeks in Paris. He even declared he was
known at the Embassy, where he had a cousin an attaché; and he asked that this gentleman should
be sent for at once from our Ambassador's to identify him. The juge d'instruction insisted
that this must be done; and Charles waited in very bad humour for the foolish formality. It
really seemed as if, after all, when we had actually caught and arrested our man, he was going
by some cunning device to escape us.

After a delay of more than an hour, during which Colonel Clay fretted and fumed quite as much
as we did, the attaché arrived. To our horror and astonishment, he proceeded to salute the
prisoner most affectionately.

"Halloa, Algy!" he cried, grasping his hand; "what's up? What do these ruffians want with you?"

It began to dawn upon us, then, what Medhurst had meant by "suspecting everybody": the real
Colonel Clay was no common adventurer, but a gentleman of birth and high connections!

The Colonel glared at us. "This fellow declares he's Sir Charles Vandrift," he said sulkily.
"Though, in fact, there are two of them. And he accuses me of forgery, fraud, and theft, Bertie."

The attaché stared hard at us. "This is Sir Charles Vandrift," he replied, after a moment.
"I remember hearing him make a speech once at a City dinner. And what charge have you to prefer,
Sir Charles, against my cousin?"

"Your cousin?" Charles cried. "This is Colonel Clay, the notorious sharper!"

The attaché smiled a gentlemanly and superior smile. "This is Colonel Clay," he answered, "of
the Bengal Staff Corps."

It began to strike us there was something wrong somewhere.

"But he has cheated me, all the same," Charles said--"at Nice two years ago, and many times
since; and this very day he has tricked me out of two thousand pounds in French bank-notes,
which he has now about him!"

The Colonel was speechless. But the attaché laughed. "What he has done to-day I don't know,"
he said; "but if it's as apocryphal as what you say he did two years ago, you've a thundering
bad case, sir; for he was then in India, and I was out there, visiting him."

"Where are the two thousand pounds?" Charles cried. "Why, you've got them in your hand! You're
holding the envelope!"

The Colonel produced it. "This envelope," he said, "was left with me by the man with short
stiff hair, who came just before you, and who announced himself as Sir Charles Vandrift. He
said he was interested in tea in Assam, and wanted me to join the board of directors of some
bogus company. These are his papers, I believe," and he handed them to his cousin.

"Well, I'm glad the notes are safe, anyhow," Charles murmured, in a tone of relief, beginning
to smell a rat. "Will you kindly return them to me?"

The attaché turned out the contents of the envelope. They proved to be prospectuses of bubble
companies of the moment, of no importance.

"Medhurst must have put them there," I cried, "and decamped with the cash."

Charles gave a groan of horror. "And Medhurst is Colonel Clay!" he exclaimed, clapping his
hand to his forehead.

"I beg your pardon, sir," the Colonel interposed. "I have but one personality, and no aliases."

It took quite half an hour to explain this imbroglio. But as soon as all was explained, in
French and English, to the satisfaction of ourselves and the juge d'instruction, the real Colonel
shook hands with us in a most forgiving way, and informed us that he had more than once wondered,
when he gave his name at shops in Paris, why it was often received with such grave suspicion.
We instructed the police that the true culprit was Medhurst, whom they had seen with their
own eyes, and whom we urged them to pursue with all expedition. Meanwhile, Charles and I, accompanied
by the Colonel and the attaché--"to see the fun out," as they said--called at the Bank of France
for the purpose of stopping the notes immediately. It was too late, however. They had been
presented at once, and cashed in gold, by a pleasant little lady in an American costume, who
was afterwards identified by the hotel-keeper (from our description) as his lodger, Mme. Picardet.
It was clear she had taken rooms in the same hotel, to be near the Indian Colonel; and it was
she who had received and sent the letters. As for our foe, he had vanished into space, as always.

Two days later we received the usual insulting communication on a sheet of Charles's own dainty
note. Last time he wrote it was on Craig-Ellachie paper: this time, like the wanton lapwing,
he had got himself another crest.

"MOST PERSPICACIOUS OF MILLIONAIRES!--Said I not well, as Medhurst, that you must distrust
everybody? And the one man you never dreamt of distrusting was--Medhurst. Yet see how truthful
I was! I told you I knew where Colonel Clay was living--and I did know, exactly. I promised
to take you to Colonel Clay's rooms, and to get him arrested for you--and I kept my promise.
I even exceeded your expectations; for I gave you two Colonel Clays instead of one--and you
took the wrong man--that is to say, the real one. This was a neat little trick; but it cost
me some trouble.

"First, I found out there was a real Colonel Clay, in the Indian Army. I also found out he
chanced to be coming home on leave this season. I might have made more out of him, no doubt;
but I disliked annoying him, and preferred to give myself the fun of this peculiar mystification.
I therefore waited for him to reach Paris, where the police arrangements suited me better than
in London. While I was looking about, and delaying operations for his return, I happened to
hear you wanted a detective. So I offered myself as out of work to my old employer, Marvillier,
from whom I have had many good jobs in the past; and there you get, in short, the kernel of
the Colonel.

"Naturally, after this, I can never go back as a detective to Marvillier's. But, on the large
scale on which I have learned to work since I first had the pleasure of making your delightful
acquaintance, this matters little. To say the truth, I begin to feel detective work a cut or
two below me. I am now a gentleman of means and leisure. Besides, the extra knowledge of your
movements which I have acquired in your house has helped still further to give me various holds
upon you. So the fluke will be true to his own pet lamb. To vary the metaphor, you are not
fully shorn yet.

"Remember me most kindly to your charming family, give Wentworth my love, and tell Mlle. Césarine
I owe her a grudge which I shall never forget. She clearly suspected me. You are much too rich,
dear Charles; I relieve your plethora. I bleed you financially. Therefore I consider myself--Your
sincerest friend,

"CLAY-BRABAZON-MEDHURST,

"Fellow of the Royal College of Surgeons."

Charles was threatened with apoplexy. This blow was severe. "Whom can I trust," he asked, plaintively,
"when the detectives themselves, whom I employ to guard me, turn out to be swindlers? Don't
you remember that line in the Latin grammar--something about, 'Who shall watch the watchers?'
I think it used to run, 'Quis custodes custodiet ipsos?'"

But I felt this episode had at least disproved my suspicions of poor Césarine.

VIII

THE EPISODE OF THE SELDON GOLD-MINE

On our return to London, Charles and Marvillier had a difference of opinion on the subject
of Medhurst.

Charles maintained that Marvillier ought to have known the man with the cropped hair was Colonel
Clay, and ought never to have recommended him. Marvillier maintained that Charles had seen
Colonel Clay half-a-dozen times, at least, to his own never; and that my respected brother-in-law
had therefore nobody on earth but himself to blame if the rogue imposed upon him. The head
detective had known Medhurst for ten years, he said, as a most respectable man, and even a
ratepayer; he had always found him the cleverest of spies, as well he might be, indeed, on
the familiar set-a-thief-to-catch-a-thief principle. However, the upshot of it all was, as
usual--nothing. Marvillier was sorry to lose the services of so excellent a hand; but he had
done the very best he could for Sir Charles, he declared; and if Sir Charles was not satisfied,
why, he might catch his Colonel Clays for himself in future.

"So I will, Sey," Charles remarked to me, as we walked back from the office in the Strand by
Piccadilly. "I won't trust any more to these private detectives. It's my belief they're a pack
of thieves themselves, in league with the rascals they're set to catch, and with no more sense
of honour than a Zulu diamond-hand."

"Better try the police," I suggested, by way of being helpful. One must assume an interest
in one's employer's business.

But Charles shook his head. "No, no," he said; "I'm sick of all these fellows. I shall trust
in future to my own sagacity. We learn by experience, Sey--and I've learned a thing or two.
One of them is this: It's not enough to suspect everybody; you must have no preconceptions.
Divest yourself entirely of every fixed idea if you wish to cope with a rascal of this calibre.
Don't jump at conclusions. We should disbelieve everything, as well as distrust everybody.
That's the road to success; and I mean to pursue it."

So, by way of pursuing it, Charles retired to Seldon.

"The longer the man goes on, the worse he grows," he said to me one morning. "He's just like
a tiger that has tasted blood. Every successful haul seems only to make him more eager for
another. I fully expect now before long we shall see him down here."

About three weeks later, sure enough, my respected connection received a communication from
the abandoned swindler, with an Austrian stamp and a Vienna post-mark.

"MY DEAR VANDRIFT.--(After so long and so varied an acquaintance we may surely drop the absurd
formalities of 'Sir Charles' and 'Colonel.') I write to ask you a delicate question. Can you
kindly tell me exactly how much I have received from your various generous acts during the
last three years? I have mislaid my account-book, and as this is the season for making the
income tax return, I am anxious, as an honest and conscientious citizen, to set down my average
profits out of you for the triennial period. For reasons which you will amply understand, I
do not this time give my private address, in Paris or elsewhere; but if you will kindly advertise
the total amount, above the signature 'Peter Simple,' in the Agony Column of the Times, you
will confer a great favour upon the Revenue Commissioners, and also upon your constant friend
and companion, CUTHBERT CLAY,

"Practical Socialist."

"Mark my word, Sey," Charles said, laying the letter down, "in a week or less the man himself
will follow. This is his cunning way of trying to make me think he's well out of the country
and far away from Seldon. That means he's meditating another descent. But he told us too much
last time, when he was Medhurst the detective. He gave us some hints about disguises and their
unmasking that I shall not forget. This turn I shall be even with him."

On Saturday of that week, in effect, we were walking along the road that leads into the village,
when we met a gentlemanly-looking man, in a rough and rather happy-go-lucky brown tweed suit,
who had the air of a tourist. He was middle-aged, and of middle height; he wore a small leather
wallet suspended round his shoulder; and he was peering about at the rocks in a suspicious
manner. Something in his gait attracted our attention.

"Good-morning," he said, looking up as we passed; and Charles muttered a somewhat surly inarticulate,
"Good-morning."

We went on without saying more. "Well, that's not Colonel Clay, anyhow," I said, as we got
out of earshot. "For he accosted us first; and you may remember it's one of the Colonel's most
marked peculiarities that, like the model child, he never speaks till he's spoken to--never
begins an acquaintance. He always waits till we make the first advance; he doesn't go out of
his way to cheat us; he loiters about till we ask him to do it."

"Seymour," my brother-in-law responded, in a severe tone, "there you are, now, doing the very
thing I warned you not to do! You're succumbing to a preconception. Avoid fixed ideas. The
probability is this man is Colonel Clay. Strangers are generally scarce at Seldon. If he isn't
Colonel Clay, what's he here for, I'd like to know? What money is there to be made here in
any other way? I shall inquire about him."

We dropped in at the Cromarty Arms, and asked good Mrs. M'Lachlan if she could tell us anything
about the gentlemanly stranger. Mrs. M'Lachlan replied that he was from London, she believed,
a pleasant gentleman enough; and he had his wife with him.

"Ha! Young? Pretty?" Charles inquired, with a speaking glance at me.

"Weel, Sir Charles, she'll no be exactly what you'd be ca'ing a bonny lass," Mrs. M'Lachlan
replied; "but she's a guid body for a' that, an' a fine braw woman."

"Just what I should expect," Charles murmured, "He varies the programme. The fellow has tried
White Heather as the parson's wife, and as Madame Picardet, and as squinting little Mrs. Granton,
and as Medhurst's accomplice; and now, he has almost exhausted the possibilities of a disguise
for a really young and pretty woman; so he's playing her off at last as the riper product--a
handsome matron. Clever, extremely clever; but--we begin to see through him." And he chuckled
to himself quietly.

Next day, on the hillside, we came upon our stranger again, occupied as before in peering into
the rocks, and sounding them with a hammer. Charles nudged me and whispered, "I have it this
time. He's posing as a geologist."

I took a good look at the man. By now, of course, we had some experience of Colonel Clay in
his various disguises; and I could observe that while the nose, the hair, and the beard were
varied, the eyes and the build remained the same as ever. He was a trifle stouter, of course,
being got up as a man of between forty and fifty; and his forehead was lined in a way which
a less consummate artist than Colonel Clay could easily have imitated. But I felt we had at
least some grounds for our identification; it would not do to dismiss the suggestion of Clayhood
at once as a flight of fancy.

His wife was sitting near, upon a bare boss of rock, reading a volume of poems. Capital variant,
that, a volume of poems! Exactly suited the selected type of a cultivated family. White Heather
and Mrs. Granton never used to read poems. But that was characteristic of all Colonel Clay's
impersonations, and Mrs. Clay's too--for I suppose I must call her so. They were not mere outer
disguises; they were finished pieces of dramatic study. Those two people were an actor and
actress, as well as a pair of rogues; and in both their rôles they were simply inimitable.

As a rule, Charles is by no means polite to casual trespassers on the Seldon estate; they get
short shrift and a summary ejection. But on this occasion he had a reason for being courteous,
and he approached the lady with a bow of recognition. "Lovely day," he said, "isn't it? Such
belts on the sea, and the heather smells sweet. You are stopping at the inn, I fancy?"

"Yes," the lady answered, looking up at him with a charming smile. ("I know that smile," Charles
whispered to me. "I have succumbed to it too often.") "We're stopping at the inn, and my husband
is doing a little geology on the hill here. I hope Sir Charles Vandrift won't come and catch
us. He's so down upon trespassers. They tell us at the inn he's a regular Tartar."

("Saucy minx as ever," Charles murmured to me. "She said it on purpose.") "No, my dear madam,"
he continued, aloud; "you have been quite misinformed. I am Sir Charles Vandrift; and I am
not a Tartar. If your husband is a man of science I respect and admire him. It is geology that
has made me what I am to-day." And he drew himself up proudly. "We owe to it the present development
of South African mining."

The lady blushed as one seldom sees a mature woman blush--but exactly as I had seen Madame
Picardet and White Heather. "Oh, I'm so sorry," she said, in a confused way that recalled Mrs.
Granton. "Forgive my hasty speech. I--I didn't know you."

("She did," Charles whispered. "But let that pass.") "Oh, don't think of it again; so many
people disturb the birds, don't you know, that we're obliged in self-defence to warn trespassers
sometimes off our lovely mountains. But I do it with regret--with profound regret. I admire
the--er--the beauties of Nature myself; and, therefore, I desire that all others should have
the freest possible access to them--possible, that is to say, consistently with the superior
claims of Property."

"I see," the lady replied, looking up at him quaintly. "I admire your wish, though not your
reservation. I've just been reading those sweet lines of Wordsworth's--

  And O, ye fountains, meadows, hills, and groves,
  Forebode not any severing of our loves.

I suppose you know them?" And she beamed on him pleasantly.

"Know them?" Charles answered. "Know them! Oh, of course, I know them. They're old favourites
of mine--in fact, I adore Wordsworth." (I doubt whether Charles has ever in his life read a
line of poetry, except Doss Chiderdoss in the Sporting Times.) He took the book and glanced
at them. "Ah, charming, charming!" he said, in his most ecstatic tone. But his eyes were on
the lady, and not on the poet.

I saw in a moment how things stood. No matter under what disguise that woman appeared to him,
and whether he recognised her or not, Charles couldn't help falling a victim to Madame Picardet's
attractions. Here he actually suspected her; yet, like a moth round a candle, he was trying
his hardest to get his wings singed! I almost despised him with his gigantic intellect! The
greatest men are the greatest fools, I verily believe, when there's a woman in question.

The husband strolled up by this time, and entered into conversation with us. According to his
own account, his name was Forbes-Gaskell, and he was a Professor of Geology in one of those
new-fangled northern colleges. He had come to Seldon rock-spying, he said, and found much to
interest him. He was fond of fossils, but his special hobby was rocks and minerals. He knew
a vast deal about cairngorms and agates and such-like pretty things, and showed Charles quartz
and felspar and red cornelian, and I don't know what else, in the crags on the hillside. Charles
pretended to listen to him with the deepest interest and even respect, never for a moment letting
him guess he knew for what purpose this show of knowledge had been recently acquired. If we
were ever to catch the man, we must not allow him to see we suspected him. So Charles played
a dark game. He swallowed the geologist whole without question.

Most of that morning we spent with them on the hillside. Charles took them everywhere and showed
them everything. He pretended to be polite to the scientific man, and he was really polite,
most polite, to the poetical lady. Before lunch time we had become quite friends.

The Clays were always easy people to get on with; and, bar their roguery, we could not deny
they were delightful companions. Charles asked them in to lunch. They accepted willingly. He
introduced them to Amelia with sundry raisings of his eyebrows and contortions of his mouth.
"Professor and Mrs. Forbes-Gaskell," he said, half-dislocating his jaw with his violent efforts.
"They're stopping at the inn, dear. I've been showing them over the place, and they're good
enough to say they'll drop in and take a share in our cold roast mutton;" which was a frequent
form of Charles's pleasantry.

Amelia sent them upstairs to wash their hands--which, in the Professor's case, was certainly
desirable, for his fingers were grimed with earth and dust from the rocks he had been investigating.
As soon as we were left alone Charles drew me into the library.

"Seymour," he said, "more than ever there is a need for us strictly to avoid preconceptions.
We must not make up our minds that this man is Colonel Clay--nor, again, that he isn't. We
must remember that we have been mistaken in both ways in the past, and must avoid our old errors.
I shall hold myself in readiness for either event--and a policeman in readiness to arrest them,
if necessary!"

"A capital plan," I murmured. "Still, if I may venture a suggestion, in what way are these
two people endeavouring to entrap us? They have no scheme on hand--no schloss, no amalgamation."

"Seymour," my brother-in-law answered in his board-room style, "you are a great deal too previous,
as Medhurst used to say--I mean, Colonel Clay in his character as Medhurst. In the first place,
these are early days; our friends have not yet developed their intentions. We may find before
long they have a property to sell, or a company to promote, or a concession to exploit in South
Africa or elsewhere. Then again, in the second place, we don't always spot the exact nature
of their plan until it has burst in our hands, so to speak, and revealed its true character.
What could have seemed more transparent than Medhurst, the detective, till he ran away with
our notes in the very moment of triumph? What more innocent than White Heather and the little
curate, till they landed us with a couple of Amelia's own gems as a splendid bargain? I will
not take it for granted any man is not Colonel Clay, merely because I don't happen to spot
the particular scheme he is trying to work against me. The rogue has so many schemes, and some
of them so well concealed, that up to the moment of the actual explosion you fail to detect
the presence of moral dynamite. Therefore, I shall proceed as if there were dynamite everywhere.
But in the third place--and this is very important--you mark my words, I believe I detect already
the lines he will work upon. He's a geologist, he says, with a taste for minerals. Very good.
You see if he doesn't try to persuade me before long he has found a coal mine, whose locality
he will disclose for a trifling consideration; or else he will salt the Long Mountain with
emeralds, and claim a big share for helping to discover them; or else he will try something
in the mineralogical line to do me somehow. I see it in the very transparency of the fellow's
face; and I'm determined this time neither to pay him one farthing on any pretext, nor to let
him escape me!"

We went in to lunch. The Professor and Mrs. Forbes-Gaskell, all smiles, accompanied us. I don't
know whether it was Charles's warning to take nothing for granted that made me do so--but I
kept a close eye upon the suspected man all the time we were at table. It struck me there was
something very odd about his hair. It didn't seem quite the same colour all over. The locks
that hung down behind, over the collar of his coat, were a trifle lighter and a trifle grayer
than the black mass that covered the greater part of his head. I examined it carefully. The
more I did so, the more the conviction grew upon me: he was wearing a wig. There was no denying it!

A trifle less artistic, perhaps, than most of Colonel Clay's get-ups; but then, I reflected
(on Charles's principle of taking nothing for granted), we had never before suspected Colonel
Clay himself, except in the one case of the Honourable David, whose red hair and whiskers even
Madame Picardet had admitted to be absurdly false by her action of pointing at them and tittering
irrepressibly. It was possible that in every case, if we had scrutinised our man closely, we
should have found that the disguise betrayed itself at once (as Medhurst had suggested) to
an acute observer.

The detective, in fact, had told us too much. I remembered what he said to us about knocking
off David Granton's red wig the moment we doubted him; and I positively tried to help myself
awkwardly to potato-chips, when the footman offered them, so as to hit the supposed wig with
an apparently careless brush of my elbow. But it was of no avail. The fellow seemed to anticipate
or suspect my intention, and dodged aside carefully, like one well accustomed to saving his
disguise from all chance of such real or seeming accidents.

I was so full of my discovery that immediately after lunch I induced Isabel to take our new
friends round the home garden and show them Charles's famous prize dahlias, while I proceeded
myself to narrate to Charles and Amelia my observations and my frustrated experiment.

"It is a wig," Amelia assented. "I spotted it at once. A very good wig, too, and most artistically
planted. Men don't notice these things, though women do. It is creditable to you, Seymour,
to have succeeded in detecting it."

Charles was less complimentary. "You fool," he answered, with that unpleasant frankness which
is much too common with him. "Supposing it is, why on earth should you try to knock it off
and disclose him? What good would it have done? If it is a wig, and we spot it, that's all
that we need. We are put on our guard; we know with whom we have now to deal. But you can't
take a man up on a charge of wig-wearing. The law doesn't interfere with it. Most respectable
men may sometimes wear wigs. Why, I knew a promoter who did, and also the director of fourteen
companies! What we have to do next is, wait till he tries to cheat us, and then--pounce down
upon him. Sooner or later, you may be sure, his plans will reveal themselves."

So we concocted an excellent scheme to keep them under constant observation, lest they should
slip away again, as they did from the island. First of all, Amelia was to ask them to come
and stop at the castle, on the ground that the rooms at the inn were uncomfortably small. We
felt sure, however, that, as on a previous occasion, they would refuse the invitation, in order
to be able to slink off unperceived, in case they should find themselves apparently suspected.
Should they decline, it was arranged that Césarine should take a room at the Cromarty Arms
as long as they stopped there, and report upon their movements; while, during the day, we would
have the house watched by the head gillie's son, a most intelligent young man, who could be
trusted, with true Scotch canniness, to say nothing to anybody.

To our immense surprise, Mrs. Forbes-Gaskell accepted the invitation with the utmost alacrity.
She was profuse in her thanks, indeed; for she told us the Arms was an ill-kept house, and
the cookery by no means agreed with her husband's liver. It was sweet of us to invite them;
such kindness to perfect strangers was quite unexpected. She should always say that nowhere
on earth had she met with so cordial or friendly a reception as at Seldon Castle. But--she
accepted, unreservedly.

"It can't be Colonel Clay," I remarked to Charles. "He would never have come here. Even as
David Granton, with far more reason for coming, he wouldn't put himself in our power: he preferred
the security and freedom of the Cromarty Arms."

"Sey," my brother-in-law said sententiously, "you're incorrigible. You will persist in being
the slave of prepossessions. He may have some good reason of his own for accepting. Wait till
he shows his hand--and then, we shall understand everything."

So for the next three weeks the Forbes-Gaskells formed part of the house-party at Seldon. I
must say, Charles paid them most assiduous attention. He positively neglected his other guests
in order to keep close to the two new-comers. Mrs. Forbes-Gaskell noticed the fact, and commented
on it. "You are really too good to us, Sir Charles," she said. "I'm afraid you allow us quite
to monopolise you!"

But Charles, gallant as ever, replied with a smile, "We have you with us for so short a time,
you know!" Which made Mrs. Forbes-Gaskell blush again that delicious blush of hers.

During all this time the Professor went on calmly and persistently mineralogising. "Wonderful
character!" Charles said to me. "He works out his parts so well! Could anything exceed the
picture he gives one of scientific ardour?" And, indeed, he was at it, morning, noon, and night.
"Sooner or later," Charles observed, "something practical must come of it."

Twice, meanwhile, little episodes occurred which are well worth notice. One day I was out with
the Professor on the Long Mountain, watching him hammer at the rocks, and a little bored by
his performance, when, to pass the time, I asked him what a particular small water-worn stone
was. He looked at it and smiled. "If there were a little more mica in it," he said, "it would
be the characteristic gneiss of ice-borne boulders, hereabouts. But there isn't quite enough."
And he gazed at it curiously.

"Indeed," I answered, "it doesn't come up to sample, doesn't it?"

He gave me a meaning look. "Ten per cent," he murmured in a slow, strange voice; "ten per cent
is more usual."

I trembled violently. Was he bent, then, upon ruining me? "If you betray me--" I cried, and
broke off.

"I beg your pardon," he said. He was all pure innocence.

I reflected on what Charles had said about taking nothing for granted, and held my tongue prudently.

The other incident was this. Charles picked a sprig of white heather on the hill one afternoon,
after a picnic lunch, I regret to say, when he had taken perhaps a glass more champagne than
was strictly good for him. He was not exactly the worse for it, but he was excited, good-humoured,
reckless, and lively. He brought the sprig to Mrs. Forbes-Gaskell, and handed it to her, ogling
a little. "Sweets to the sweet," he murmured, and looked at her meaningly. "White heather to
White Heather." Then he saw what he had done, and checked himself instantly.

Mrs. Forbes-Gaskell coloured up in the usual manner. "I--I don't quite understand," she faltered.

Charles scrambled out of it somehow. "White heather for luck," he said, "and--the man who is
privileged to give a piece of it to you is surely lucky."

She smiled, none too well pleased. I somehow felt she suspected us of suspecting her.

However, as it turned out, nothing came, after all, of the untoward incident.

Next day Charles burst upon me, triumphant. "Well, he has shown his hand!" he cried. "I knew
he would. He has come to me to-day with--what do you think?--a fragment of gold, in quartz,
from the Long Mountain."

"No!" I exclaimed.

"Yes," Charles answered. "He says there's a vein there with distinct specks of gold in it,
which might be worth mining. When a man begins that way you know what he's driving at! And
what's more, he's got up the subject beforehand; for he began saying to me there had long been
gold in Sutherlandshire--why not therefore in Ross-shire? And then he went at full into the
comparative geology of the two regions."

"This is serious," I said. "What will you do?"

"Wait and watch," Charles answered; "and the moment he develops a proposal for shares in the
syndicate to work the mine, or a sum of money down as the price of his discovery--get in the
police, and arrest him."

For the next few days the Professor was more active and ardent than ever. He went peering about
the rocks on every side with his hammer. He kept on bringing in little pieces of stone, with
gold specks stuck in them, and talking learnedly of the "probable cost of crushing and milling."
Charles had heard all that before; in point of fact, he had assisted at the drafting of some
dozens of prospectuses. So he took no notice, and waited for the man with the wig to develop
his proposals. He knew they would come soon; and he watched and waited. But, of course, to
draw him on he pretended to be interested.

While we were all in this attitude of mind, attending on Providence and Colonel Clay, we happened
to walk down by the shore one day, in the opposite direction from the Seamew's island. Suddenly
we came upon the Professor linked arm-in-arm with--Sir Adolphus Cordery! They were wrapped
in deep talk, and appeared to be most amicable.

Now, naturally, relations had been a trifle strained between Sir Adolphus and the house of
Vandrift since the incident of the Slump; but under the present circumstances, and with such
a matter at stake as the capture of Colonel Clay, it was necessary to overlook all such minor
differences. So Charles managed to disengage the Professor from his friend, sent Amelia on
with Forbes-Gaskell towards the castle, and stopped behind, himself, with Sir Adolphus and
me, to clear up the question.

"Do you know this man, Cordery?" he asked, with some little suspicion.

"Know him? Why, of course I do," Sir Adolphus answered. "He's Marmaduke Forbes-Gaskell, of
the Yorkshire College, a very distinguished man of science. First-rate mineralogist--perhaps
the best (but one) in England." Modesty forbade him to name the exception.

"But are you sure it's he?" Charles inquired, with growing doubt. "Have you known him before?
This isn't a second case of Schleiermachering me, is it?"

"Sure it's he?" Sir Adolphus echoed. "Am I sure of myself? Why, I've known Marmy Gaskell ever
since we were at Trinity together. Knew him before he married Miss Forbes of Glenluce, my wife's
second cousin, and hyphened his name with hers, to keep the property in the family. Know them
both most intimately. Came down here to the inn because I heard that Marmy was on the prowl
among these hills, and I thought he had probably something good to prowl after--in the way
of fossils."

"But the man wears a wig!" Charles expostulated.

"Of course," Cordery answered. "He's as bald as a bat--in front at least--and he wears a wig
to cover his baldness."

"It's disgraceful," Charles exclaimed; "disgraceful--taking us in like that." And he grew red
as a turkey-cock.

Sir Adolphus has no delicacy. He burst out laughing.

"Oh, I see," he cried out, simply bursting with amusement. "You thought Forbes-Gaskell was
Colonel Clay in disguise! Oh, my stars, what a lovely one!"

"You, at least, have no right to laugh," Charles responded, drawing himself up and growing
still redder. "You led me once into a similar scrape, and then backed out of it in a way unbecoming
a gentleman. Besides," he went on, getting angrier at each word, "this fellow, whoever he is,
has been trying to cheat me on his own account. Colonel Clay or no Colonel Clay, he's been
salting my rocks with gold-bearing quartz, and trying to lead me on into an absurd speculation!"

Sir Adolphus exploded. "Oh, this is too good," he cried. "I must go and tell Marmy!" And he
rushed off to where Forbes-Gaskell was seated on a corner of rock with Amelia.

As for Charles and myself, we returned to the house. Half an hour later Forbes-Gaskell came
back, too, in a towering temper.

"What is the meaning of this, sir?" he shouted out, as soon as he caught sight of Charles.
"I'm told you've invited my wife and myself here to your house in order to spy upon us, under
the impression that I was Clay, the notorious swindler!"

"I thought you were," Charles answered, equally angry. "Perhaps you may be still! Anyhow, you're
a rogue, and you tried to bamboozle me!"

Forbes-Gaskell, white with rage, turned to his trembling wife. "Gertrude," he said, "pack up
your box and come away from these people instantly. Their pretended hospitality has been a
studied insult. They've put you and me in a most ridiculous position. We were told before we
came here--and no doubt with truth--that Sir Charles Vandrift was the most close-fisted and
tyrannical old curmudgeon in Scotland. We've been writing to all our friends to say ecstatically
that he was, on the contrary, a most hospitable, generous, and large-hearted gentleman. And
now we find out he's a disgusting cad, who asks strangers to his house from the meanest motives,
and then insults his guests with gratuitous vituperation. It is well such people should hear
the plain truth now and again in their lives; and it therefore gives me the greatest pleasure
to tell Sir Charles Vandrift that he's a vulgar bounder of the first water. Go and pack your
box, Gertrude! I'll run down to the Cromarty Arms, and order a cab to carry us away at once
from this inhospitable sham castle."

"You wear a wig, sir; you wear a wig," Charles exclaimed, half-choking with passion. For, indeed,
as Forbes-Gaskell spoke, and tossed his head angrily, the nature of his hair-covering grew
painfully apparent. It was quite one-sided.

"I do, sir, that I may be able to shake it in the face of a cad!" the Professor responded,
tearing it off to readjust it; and, suiting the action to the word, he brandished it thrice
in Charles's eyes; after which he darted from the room, speechless with indignation.

As soon as they were gone, and Charles had recovered breath sufficiently to listen to rational
conversation, I ventured to observe, "This comes of being too sure! We made one mistake. We
took it for granted that because a man wears a wig, he must be an impostor--which does not
necessarily follow. We forgot that not Colonel Clays alone have false coverings to their heads,
and that wigs may sometimes be worn from motives of pure personal vanity. In fact, we were
again the slaves of preconceptions."

I looked at him pointedly. Charles rose before he replied. "Seymour Wentworth," he said at
last, gazing down upon me with lofty scorn, "your moralising is ill-timed. It appears to me
you entirely misunderstand the position and duties of a private secretary!"

The oddest part of it all, however, was this--that Charles, being convinced Forbes-Gaskell,
though he wasn't Colonel Clay, had been fraudulently salting the rocks with gold, with intent
to deceive, took no further notice of the alleged discoveries. The consequence was that Forbes-Gaskell
and Sir Adolphus went elsewhere with the secret; and it was not till after Charles had sold
the Seldon Castle estate (which he did shortly afterward, the place having somehow grown strangely
distasteful to him) that the present "Seldon Eldorados, Limited," were put upon the market
by Lord Craig-Ellachie, who purchased the place from him. Forbes-Gaskell, as it happened, had
reported to Craig-Ellachie that he had found a lode of high-grade ore on an estate unnamed,
which he would particularise on promise of certain contingent claims to founder's shares; and
the old lord jumped at it. Charles sold at grouse-moor prices; and the consequence is that
the capital of the Eldorados is yielding at present very fair returns, even after allowing
for expenses of promotion--while Charles has been done out of a good thing in gold-mines!

But, remembering "the position and duties of a private secretary," I refrained from pointing
out to him at the time that this loss was due to a fixed idea--though as a matter of fact it
depended upon Charles's strange preconception that the man with the wig, whoever he might be,
was trying to diddle him.

 Charles declared he wouldn't leave the hotel till he recovered his property; and for
myself, I was inclined to suppose we would have to remain there accordingly for the term of
our natural lives--and longer.

That night again we spent at the Lakeside Hotel. In the small hours of the morning, as I lay
awake and meditated, a thought broke across me. I was so excited by it that I rose and rushed
into my brother-in-law's bedroom. "Charles, Charles!" I exclaimed, "we have taken too much
for granted once more. Perhaps Elihu Quackenboss carried off your dispatch-box!"

"You fool," Charles answered, in his most unamiable manner (he applies that word to me with
increasing frequency); "is that what you've waked me up for? Why, the Quackenbosses left Lake
George on Tuesday morning, and I had the dispatch-box in my own hands on Wednesday."

"We have only their word for it," I cried. "Perhaps they stopped on--and walked off with it
afterwards!"

"We will inquire to-morrow," Charles answered. "But I confess I don't think it was worth waking
me up for. I could stake my life on that little woman's integrity."

We did inquire next morning--with this curious result: it turned out that, though the Quackenbosses
had left the Lakeside Hotel on Tuesday, it was only for the neighbouring Washington House,
which they quitted on Wednesday morning, taking the same train for Saratoga which Charles and
I had intended to go by. Mrs. Quackenboss carried a small brown paper parcel in her hands--in
which, under the circumstances, we had little difficulty in recognising Charles's dispatch-box,
loosely enveloped.

Then I knew how it was done. The chambermaid, loitering about the room for a tip, was--Mrs.
Quackenboss! It needed but an apron to transform her pretty travelling-dress into a chambermaid's
costume; and in any of those huge American hotels one chambermaid more or less would pass in
the crowd without fear of challenge.

"We will follow them on to Saratoga," Charles cried. "Pay the bill at once, Seymour."

"Certainly," I answered. "Will you give me some money?"

Charles clapped his hand to his pockets. "All, all in the dispatch-box," he murmured.

That tied us up another day, till we could get some ready cash from our agents in New York;
for the manager, already most suspicious at the change of name and the accusation of theft,
peremptorily refused to accept Charles's cheque, or anything else, as he phrased it, except
"hard money." So we lingered on perforce at Lake George in ignoble inaction.

"Of course," I observed to my brother-in-law that evening, "Elihu Quackenboss was Colonel Clay."

"I suppose so," Charles murmured resignedly. "Everybody I meet seems to be Colonel Clay nowadays--except
when I believe they are, in which case they turn out to be harmless nobodies. But who would
have thought it was he after I pulled his hair out? Or after he persisted in his trick, even
when I suspected him--which, he told us at Seldon, was against his first principles?"

A light dawned upon me again. But, warned by previous ebullitions, I expressed myself this
time with becoming timidity. "Charles," I suggested, "may we not here again have been the slaves
of a preconception? We thought Forbes-Gaskell was Colonel Clay--for no better reason than because
he wore a wig. We thought Elihu Quackenboss wasn't Colonel Clay--for no better reason than
because he didn't wear one. But how do we know he ever wears wigs? Isn't it possible, after
all, that those hints he gave us about make-up, when he was Medhurst the detective, were framed
on purpose, so as to mislead and deceive us? And isn't it possible what he said of his methods
at the Seamew's island that day was similarly designed in order to hoodwink us?"

"That is so obvious, Sey," my brother-in-law observed, in a most aggrieved tone, "that I should
have thought any secretary worth his salt would have arrived at it instantly."

I abstained from remarking that Charles himself had not arrived at it even now, until I told
him. I thought that to say so would serve no good purpose. So I merely went on: "Well, it seems
to me likely that when he came as Medhurst, with his hair cut short, he was really wearing
his own natural crop, in its simplest form and of its native hue. By now it has had time to
grow long and bushy. When he was David Granton, no doubt, he clipped it to an intermediate
length, trimmed his beard and moustache, and dyed them all red, to a fine Scotch colour. As
the Seer, again, he wore his hair much the same as Elihu's; only, to suit the character, more
combed and fluffy. As the little curate, he darkened it and plastered it down. As Von Lebenstein,
he shaved close, but cultivated his moustache to its utmost dimensions, and dyed it black after
the Tyrolese fashion. He need never have had a wig; his own natural hair would throughout have
been sufficient, allowing for intervals."

"You're right, Sey," my brother-in-law said, growing almost friendly. "I will do you the justice
to admit that's the nearest thing we have yet struck out to an idea for tracking him."

On the Saturday morning a letter arrived which relieved us a little from our momentary tension.
It was from our enemy himself--but most different in tone from his previous bantering communications:--

"Saratoga, Friday.

"SIR CHARLES VANDRIFT--Herewith I return your dispatch-box, intact, with the papers untouched.
As you will readily observe, it has not even been opened.

"You will ask me the reason for this strange conduct. Let me be serious for once, and tell
you truthfully.

"White Heather and I (for I will stick to Mr. Wentworth's judicious sobriquet) came over on
the Etruria with you, intending, as usual, to make something out of you. We followed you to
Lake George--for I had 'forced a card,' after my habitual plan, by inducing you to invite us,
with the fixed intention of playing a particular trick upon you. It formed no part of our original
game to steal your dispatch-box; that I consider a simple and elementary trick unworthy the
skill of a practised operator. We persisted in the preparations for our coup, till you pulled
my hair out. Then, to my great surprise, I saw you exhibited a degree of regret and genuine
compunction with which, till that moment, I could never have credited you. You thought you
had hurt my feelings; and you behaved more like a gentleman than I had previously known you
to do. You not only apologised, but you also endeavoured voluntarily to make reparation. That
produced an effect upon me. You may not believe it, but I desisted accordingly from the trick
I had prepared for you.

"I might also have accepted your offer to go to South Africa, where I could soon have cleared
out, having embezzled thousands. But, then, I should have been in a position of trust and responsibility--and
I am not quite rogue enough to rob you under those conditions.

"Whatever else I am, however, I am not a hypocrite. I do not pretend to be anything more than
a common swindler. If I return you your papers intact, it is only on the same principle as
that of the Australian bushranger, who made a lady a present of her own watch because she had
sung to him and reminded him of England. In other words, he did not take it from her. In like
manner, when I found you had behaved, for once, like a gentleman, contrary to my expectation,
I declined to go on with the trick I then meditated. Which does not mean to say I may not hereafter
play you some other. That will depend upon your future good behaviour.

"Why, then, did I get White Heather to purloin your dispatch-box, with intent to return it?
Out of pure lightness of heart? Not so; but in order to let you see I really meant it. If I
had gone off with no swag, and then written you this letter, you would not have believed me.
You would have thought it was merely another of my failures. But when I have actually got all
your papers into my hands, and give them up again of my own free will, you must see that I mean it.

"I will end, as I began, seriously. My trade has not quite crushed out of me all germs or relics
of better feeling; and when I see a millionaire behave like a man, I feel ashamed to take advantage
of that gleam of manliness.

"Yours, with a tinge of penitence, but still a rogue, CUTHBERT CLAY."

The first thing Charles did on receiving this strange communication was to bolt downstairs
and inquire for the dispatch-box. It had just arrived by Eagle Express Company. Charles rushed
up to our rooms again, opened it feverishly, and counted his documents. When he found them
all safe, he turned to me with a hard smile. "This letter," he said, with quivering lips, "I
consider still more insulting than all his previous ones."

But, for myself, I really thought there was a ring of truth about it. Colonel Clay was a rogue,
no doubt--a most unblushing rogue; but even a rogue, I believe, has his better moments.

And the phrase about the "position of trust and responsibility" touched Charles to the quick,
I suppose, in re the Slump in Cloetedorp Golcondas. Though, to be sure, it was a hit at me
as well, over the ten per cent commission.

THE EPISODE OF THE GAME OF POKER

"Seymour," my brother-in-law said, with a deep-drawn sigh, as we left Lake George next day
by the Rennselaer and Saratoga Railroad, "no more Peter Porter for me, if you please! I'm sick
of disguises. Now that we know Colonel Clay is here in America, they serve no good purpose;
so I may as well receive the social consideration and proper respect to which my rank and position
naturally entitle me."

"And which they secure for the most part (except from hotel clerks), even in this republican
land," I answered briskly.

For in my humble opinion, for sound copper-bottomed snobbery, registered A1 at Lloyd's, give
me the free-born American citizen.

We travelled through the States, accordingly, for the next four months, from Maine to California,
and from Oregon to Florida, under our own true names, "Confirming the churches," as Charles
facetiously put it--or in other words, looking into the management and control of railways,
syndicates, mines, and cattle-ranches. We inquired about everything. And the result of our
investigations appeared to be, as Charles further remarked, that the Sabeans who so troubled
the sons of Job seemed to have migrated in a body to Kansas and Nebraska, and that several
thousand head of cattle seemed mysteriously to vanish, à la Colonel Clay, into the pure air
of the prairies just before each branding.

However, we were fortunate in avoiding the incursions of the Colonel himself, who must have
migrated meanwhile on some enchanted carpet to other happy hunting-grounds.

It was chill October before we found ourselves safe back in New York, en route for England.
So long a term of freedom from the Colonel's depredations (as Charles fondly imagined--but
I will not anticipate) had done my brother-in-law's health and spirits a world of good; he
was so lively and cheerful that he began to fancy his tormentor must have succumbed to yellow
fever, then raging in New Orleans, or eaten himself ill, as we nearly did ourselves, on a generous
mixture of clam-chowder, terrapin, soft-shelled crabs, Jersey peaches, canvas-backed ducks,
Catawba wine, winter cherries, brandy cocktails, strawberry-shortcake, ice-creams, corn-dodger,
and a judicious brew commonly known as a Colorado corpse-reviver. However that may be, Charles
returned to New York in excellent trim; and, dreading in that great city the wiles of his antagonist,
he cheerfully accepted the invitation of his brother millionaire, Senator Wrengold of Nevada,
to spend a few days before sailing in the Senator's magnificent and newly-finished palace at
the upper end of Fifth Avenue.

"There, at least, I shall be safe, Sey," he said to me plaintively, with a weary smile. "Wrengold,
at any rate, won't try to take me in--except, of course, in the regular way of business."

Boss-Nugget Hall (as it is popularly christened) is perhaps the handsomest brown stone mansion
in the Richardsonian style on all Fifth Avenue. We spent a delightful week there. The lines
had fallen to us in pleasant places. On the night we arrived Wrengold gave a small bachelor
party in our honour. He knew Sir Charles was travelling without Lady Vandrift, and rightly
judged he would prefer on his first night an informal party, with cards and cigars, instead
of being bothered with the charming, but still somewhat hampering addition of female society.

The guests that evening were no more than seven, all told, ourselves included--making up, Wrengold
said, that perfect number, an octave. He was a nouveau riche himself--the newest of the new--commonly
known in exclusive old-fashioned New York society as the Gilded Squatter; for he "struck his
reef" no more than ten years ago; and he was therefore doubly anxious, after the American style,
to be "just dizzy with culture." In his capacity of Mæcenas, he had invited amongst others
the latest of English literary arrivals in New York--Mr. Algernon Coleyard, the famous poet,
and leader of the Briar-rose school of West-country fiction.

"You know him in London, of course?" he observed to Charles, with a smile, as we waited dinner
for our guests.

"No," Charles answered stolidly. "I have not had that honour. We move, you see, in different
circles."

I observed by a curious shade which passed over Senator Wrengold's face that he quite misapprehended
my brother-in-law's meaning. Charles wished to convey, of course, that Mr. Coleyard belonged
to a mere literary and Bohemian set in London, while he himself moved on a more exalted plane
of peers and politicians. But the Senator, better accustomed to the new-rich point of view,
understood Charles to mean that he had not the entrée of that distinguished coterie in which
Mr. Coleyard posed as a shining luminary. Which naturally made him rate even higher than before
his literary acquisition.

At two minutes past the hour the poet entered. Even if we had not been already familiar with
his portrait at all ages in The Strand Magazine, we should have recognised him at once for
a genuine bard by his impassioned eyes, his delicate mouth, the artistic twirl of one gray
lock upon his expansive brow, the grizzled moustache that gave point and force to the genial
smile, and the two white rows of perfect teeth behind it. Most of our fellow-guests had met
Coleyard before at a reception given by the Lotus Club that afternoon, for the bard had reached
New York but the previous evening; so Charles and I were the only visitors who remained to
be introduced to him. The lion of the hour was attired in ordinary evening dress, with no foppery
of any kind, but he wore in his buttonhole a dainty blue flower whose name I do not know; and
as he bowed distantly to Charles, whom he surveyed through his eyeglass, the gleam of a big
diamond in the middle of his shirt-front betrayed the fact that the Briar-rose school, as it
was called (from his famous epic), had at least succeeded in making money out of poetry. He
explained to us a little later, in fact, that he was over in New York to look after his royalties.
"The beggars," he said, "only gave me eight hundred pounds on my last volume. I couldn't stand
that, you know; for a modern bard, moving with the age, can only sing when duly wound up; so
I've run across to investigate. Put a penny in the slot, don't you see, and the poet will pipe
for you."

"Exactly like myself," Charles said, finding a point in common. "I'm interested in mines; and
I, too, have come over to look after my royalties."

The poet placed his eyeglass in his eye once more, and surveyed Charles deliberately from head
to foot. "Oh," he murmured slowly. He said not a word more; but somehow, everybody felt that
Charles was demolished. I saw that Wrengold, when we went in to dinner, hastily altered the
cards that marked their places. He had evidently put Charles at first to sit next the poet;
he varied that arrangement now, setting Algernon Coleyard between a railway king and a magazine
editor. I have seldom seen my respected brother-in-law so completely silenced.

The poet's conduct during dinner was most peculiar. He kept quoting poetry at inopportune moments.

"Roast lamb or boiled turkey, sir?" said the footman.

"Mary had a little lamb," said the poet. "I shall imitate Mary."

Charles and the Senator thought the remark undignified.

After dinner, however, under the mellowing influence of some excellent Roederer, Charles began
to expand again, and grew lively and anecdotal. The poet had made us all laugh not a little
with various capital stories of London literary society--at least two of them, I think, new
ones; and Charles was moved by generous emulation to contribute his own share to the amusement
of the company. He was in excellent cue. He is not often brilliant; but when he chooses, he
has a certain dry vein of caustic humour which is decidedly funny, though not perhaps strictly
without being vulgar. On this particular night, then, warmed with the admirable Wrengold champagne--the
best made in America--he launched out into a full and embroidered description of the various
ways in which Colonel Clay had deceived him. I will not say that he narrated them in full with
the same frankness and accuracy that I have shown in these pages; he suppressed not a few of
the most amusing details--on no other ground, apparently, than because they happened to tell
against himself; and he enlarged a good deal on the surprising cleverness with which several
times he had nearly secured his man; but still, making all allowances for native vanity in
concealment and addition, he was distinctly funny--he represented the matter for once in its
ludicrous rather than in its disastrous aspect. He observed also, looking around the table,
that after all he had lost less by Colonel Clay in four years of persecution than he often
lost by one injudicious move in a single day on the London Stock Exchange; while he seemed
to imply to the solid men of New York, that he would cheerfully sacrifice such a fleabite as
that, in return for the amusement and excitement of the chase which the Colonel had afforded him.

The poet was pleased. "You are a man of spirit, Sir Charles," he said. "I love to see this
fine old English admiration of pluck and adventure! The fellow must really have some good in
him, after all. I should like to take notes of a few of those stories; they would supply nice
material for basing a romance upon."

"I hardly know whether I'm exactly the man to make the hero of a novel," Charles murmured,
with complacence. And he certainly didn't look it.

"I was thinking rather of Colonel Clay as the hero," the poet responded coldly.

"Ah, that's the way with you men of letters," Charles answered, growing warm. "You always have
a sneaking sympathy with the rascals."

"That may be better," Coleyard retorted, in an icy voice, "than sympathy with the worst forms
of Stock Exchange speculation."

The company smiled uneasily. The railway king wriggled. Wrengold tried to change the subject
hastily. But Charles would not be put down.

"You must hear the end, though," he said. "That's not quite the worst. The meanest thing about
the man is that he's also a hypocrite. He wrote me such a letter at the end of his last trick--here,
positively here, in America." And he proceeded to give his own version of the Quackenboss incident,
enlivened with sundry imaginative bursts of pure Vandrift fancy.

When Charles spoke of Mrs. Quackenboss the poet smiled. "The worst of married women," he said,
"is--that you can't marry them; the worst of unmarried women is--that they want to marry you."
But when it came to the letter, the poet's eye was upon my brother-in-law. Charles, I must
fain admit, garbled the document sadly. Still, even so, some gleam of good feeling remained
in its sentences. But Charles ended all by saying, "So, to crown his misdemeanours, the rascal
shows himself a whining cur and a disgusting Pharisee."

"Don't you think," the poet interposed, in his cultivated drawl, "he may have really meant
it? Why should not some grain of compunction have stirred his soul still?--some remnant of
conscience made him shrink from betraying a man who confided in him? I have an idea, myself,
that even the worst of rogues have always some good in them. I notice they often succeed to
the end in retaining the affection and fidelity of women."

"Oh, I said so!" Charles sneered. "I told you you literary men have always an underhand regard
for a scoundrel."

"Perhaps so," the poet answered. "For we are all of us human. Let him that is without sin among
us cast the first stone." And then he relapsed into moody silence.

We rose from table. Cigars went round. We adjourned to the smoking-room. It was a Moorish marvel,
with Oriental hangings. There, Senator Wrengold and Charles exchanged reminiscences of bonanzas
and ranches and other exciting post-prandial topics; while the magazine editor cut in now and
again with a pertinent inquiry or a quaint and sarcastic parallel instance. It was clear he
had an eye to future copy. Only Algernon Coleyard sat brooding and silent, with his chin on
one hand, and his brow intent, musing and gazing at the embers in the fireplace. The hand,
by the way, was remarkable for a curious, antique-looking ring, apparently of Egyptian or Etruscan
workmanship, with a projecting gem of several large facets. Once only, in the midst of a game
of whist, he broke out with a single comment.

"Hawkins was made an earl," said Charles, speaking of some London acquaintance.

"What for?" asked the Senator.

"Successful adulteration," said the poet tartly.

"Honours are easy," the magazine editor put in.

"And two by tricks to Sir Charles," the poet added.

Towards the close of the evening, however--the poet still remaining moody, not to say positively
grumpy--Senator Wrengold proposed a friendly game of Swedish poker. It was the latest fashionable
variant in Western society on the old gambling round, and few of us knew it, save the omniscient
poet and the magazine editor. It turned out afterwards that Wrengold proposed that particular
game because he had heard Coleyard observe at the Lotus Club the same afternoon that it was
a favourite amusement of his. Now, however, for a while he objected to playing. He was a poor
man, he said, and the rest were all rich; why should he throw away the value of a dozen golden
sonnets just to add one more pinnacle to the gilded roofs of a millionaire's palace? Besides,
he was half-way through with an ode he was inditing to Republican simplicity. The pristine
austerity of a democratic senatorial cottage had naturally inspired him with memories of Dentatus,
the Fabii, Camillus. But Wrengold, dimly aware he was being made fun of somehow, insisted that
the poet must take a hand with the financiers. "You can pass, you know," he said, "as often
as you like; and you can stake low, or go it blind, according as you're inclined to. It's a
democratic game; every man decides for himself how high he will play, except the banker; and
you needn't take bank unless you want it."

"Oh, if you insist upon it," Coleyard drawled out, with languid reluctance, "I'll play, of
course. I won't spoil your evening. But remember, I'm a poet; I have strange inspirations."

The cards were "squeezers"--that is to say, had the suit and the number of pips in each printed
small in the corner, as well as over the face, for ease of reference. We played low at first.
The poet seldom staked; and when he did--a few pounds--he lost, with singular persistence.
He wanted to play for doubloons or sequins, and could with difficulty be induced to condescend
to dollars. Charles looked across at him at last; the stakes by that time were fast rising
higher, and we played for ready money. Notes lay thick on the green cloth. "Well," he murmured
provokingly, "how about your inspiration? Has Apollo deserted you?"

It was an unwonted flight of classical allusion for Charles, and I confess it astonished me.
(I discovered afterwards he had cribbed it from a review in that evening's Critic.) But the
poet smiled.

"No," he answered calmly, "I am waiting for one now. When it comes, you may be sure you shall
have the benefit of it."

Next round, Charles dealing and banking, the poet staked on his card, unseen as usual. He staked
like a gentleman. To our immense astonishment he pulled out a roll of notes, and remarked,
in a quiet tone, "I have an inspiration now. Half-hearted will do. I go five thousand." That
was dollars, of course; but it amounted to a thousand pounds in English money--high play for
an author.

Charles smiled and turned his card. The poet turned his--and won a thousand.

"Good shot!" Charles murmured, pretending not to mind, though he detests losing.

"Inspiration!" the poet mused, and looked once more abstracted.

Charles dealt again. The poet watched the deal with boiled-fishy eyes. His thoughts were far
away. His lips moved audibly. "Myrtle, and kirtle, and hurtle," he muttered. "They'll do for
three. Then there's turtle, meaning dove; and that finishes the possible. Laurel and coral
make a very bad rhyme. Try myrtle; don't you think so?"

"Do you stake?" Charles asked, severely, interrupting his reverie.

The poet started. "No, pass," he replied, looking down at his card, and subsided into muttering.
We caught a tremor of his lips again, and heard something like this: "Not less but more republican
than thou, Half-hearted watcher by the Western sea, After long years I come to visit thee,
And test thy fealty to that maiden vow, That bound thee in thy budding prime For Freedom's bride--"

"Stake?" Charles interrupted, inquiringly, again.

"Yes, five thousand," the poet answered dreamily, pushing forward his pile of notes, and never
ceasing from his murmur: "For Freedom's bride to all succeeding time. Succeeding; succeeding;
weak word, succeeding. Couldn't go five dollars on it."

Charles turned his card once more. The poet had won again. Charles passed over his notes. The
poet raked them in with a far-away air, as one who looks at infinity, and asked if he could
borrow a pencil and paper. He had a few priceless lines to set down which might otherwise escape
him.

"This is play," Charles said pointedly. "Will you kindly attend to one thing or the other?"

The poet glanced at him with a compassionate smile. "I told you I had inspirations," he said.
"They always come together. I can't win your money as fast as I would like, unless at the same
time I am making verses. Whenever I hit upon a good epithet, I back my luck, don't you see?
I won a thousand on half-hearted and a thousand on budding; if I were to back succeeding, I
should lose, to a certainty. You understand my system?"

"I call it pure rubbish," Charles answered. "However, continue. Systems were made for fools--and
to suit wise men. Sooner or later you must lose at such a stupid fancy."

The poet continued. "For Freedom's bride to all ensuing time."

"Stake!" Charles cried sharply. We each of us staked.

"Ensuing," the poet murmured. "To all ensuing time. First-rate epithet that. I go ten thousand,
Sir Charles, on ensuing."

We all turned up. Some of us lost, some won; but the poet had secured his two thousand sterling.

"I haven't that amount about me," Charles said, in that austerely nettled voice which he always
assumes when he loses at cards; "but--I'll settle it with you to-morrow."

"Another round?" the host asked, beaming.

"No, thank you," Charles answered; "Mr. Coleyard's inspirations come too pat for my taste.
His luck beats mine. I retire from the game, Senator."

Just at that moment a servant entered, bearing a salver, with a small note in an envelope.
"For Mr. Coleyard," he observed; "and the messenger said, urgent."

Coleyard tore it open hurriedly. I could see he was agitated. His face grew white at once.

"I--I beg your pardon," he said. "I--I must go back instantly. My wife is dangerously ill--quite
a sudden attack. Forgive me, Senator. Sir Charles, you shall have your revenge to-morrow."

It was clear that his voice faltered. We felt at least he was a man of feeling. He was obviously
frightened. His coolness forsook him. He shook hands as in a dream, and rushed downstairs for
his dust-coat. Almost as he closed the front door, a new guest entered, just missing him in
the vestibule.

"Halloa, you men," he said, "we've been taken in, do you know? It's all over the Lotus. The
man we made an honorary member of the club to-day is not Algernon Coleyard. He's a blatant
impostor. There's a telegram come in on the tape to-night saying Algernon Coleyard is dangerously
ill at his home in England."

Charles gasped a violent gasp. "Colonel Clay!" he shouted, aloud. "And once more he's done
me. There's not a moment to lose. After him, gentlemen! after him!"

Never before in our lives had we had such a close shave of catching and fixing the redoubtable
swindler. We burst down the stairs in a body, and rushed out into Fifth Avenue. The pretended
poet had only a hundred yards' start of us, and he saw he was discovered. But he was an excellent
runner. So was I, weight for age; and I dashed wildly after him. He turned round a corner;
it proved to lead nowhere, and lost him time. He darted back again, madly. Delighted with the
idea that I was capturing so famous a criminal, I redoubled my efforts--and came up with him,
panting. He was wearing a light dust-coat. I seized it in my hands. "I've got you at last!"
I cried; "Colonel Clay, I've got you!"

He turned and looked at me. "Ha, old Ten Per Cent!" he called out, struggling. "It's you, then,
is it? Never, never to you, sir!" And as he spoke, he somehow flung his arms straight out behind
him, and let the dust-coat slip off, which it easily did, the sleeves being new and smoothly
silk-lined. The suddenness of the movement threw me completely off my guard, and off my legs
as well. I was clinging to the coat and holding him. As the support gave way I rolled over
backward, in the mud of the street, and hurt my back seriously. As for Colonel Clay, with a
nervous laugh, he bolted off at full speed in his evening coat, and vanished round a corner.

It was some seconds before I had sufficiently recovered my breath to pick myself up again,
and examine my bruises. By this time Charles and the other pursuers had come up, and I explained
my condition to them. Instead of commending me for my zeal in his cause--which had cost me
a barked arm and a good evening suit--my brother-in-law remarked, with an unfeeling sneer,
that when I had so nearly caught my man I might as well have held him.

"I have his coat, at least," I said. "That may afford us a clue." And I limped back with it
in my hands, feeling horribly bruised and a good deal shaken.

When we came to examine the coat, however, it bore no maker's name; the strap at the back,
where the tailor proclaims with pride his handicraft, had been carefully ripped off, and its
place was taken by a tag of plain black tape without inscription of any sort. We searched the
breast-pocket. A handkerchief, similarly nameless, but of finest cambric. The side-pockets--ha,
what was this? I drew a piece of paper out in triumph. It was a note--a real find--the one
which the servant had handed to our friend just before at the Senator's.

We read it through breathlessly:--

"DARLING PAUL,--I told you it was too dangerous. You should have listened to me. You ought
never to have imitated any real person. I happened to glance at the hotel tape just now, to
see the quotations for Cloetedorps to-day, and what do you think I read as part of the latest
telegram from England? 'Mr. Algernon Coleyard, the famous poet, is lying on his death-bed at
his home in Devonshire.' By this time all New York knows. Don't stop one minute. Say I'm dangerously
ill, and come away at once. Don't return to the hotel. I am removing our things. Meet me at
Mary's. Your devoted, MARGOT."

"This is very important," Charles said. "This does give us a clue. We know two things now:
his real name is Paul--whatever else it may be, and Madame Picardet's is Margot."

I searched the pocket again, and pulled out a ring. Evidently he had thrust these two things
there when he saw me pursuing him, and had forgotten or neglected them in the heat of the mêlée.

I looked at it close. It was the very ring I had noticed on his finger while he was playing
Swedish poker. It had a large compound gem in the centre, set with many facets, and rising
like a pyramid to a point in the middle. There were eight faces in all, some of them composed
of emerald, amethyst, or turquoise. But one face--the one that turned at a direct angle towards
the wearer's eye--was not a gem at all, but an extremely tiny convex mirror. In a moment I
spotted the trick. He held this hand carelessly on the table while my brother-in-law dealt;
and when he saw that the suit and number of his own card mirrored in it by means of the squeezers
were better than Charles's, he had "an inspiration," and backed his luck--or rather his knowledge--with
perfect confidence. I did not doubt, either, that his odd-looking eyeglass was a powerful magnifier
which helped him in the trick. Still, we tried another deal, by way of experiment--I wearing
the ring; and even with the naked eye I was able to distinguish in every case the suit and
pips of the card that was dealt me.

"Why, that was almost dishonest," the Senator said, drawing back. He wished to show us that
even far-Western speculators drew a line somewhere.

"Yes," the magazine editor echoed. "To back your skill is legal; to back your luck is foolish;
to back your knowledge is--"

"Immoral," I suggested.

"Very good business," said the magazine editor.

"It's a simple trick," Charles interposed. "I should have spotted it if it had been done by
any other fellow. But his patter about inspiration put me clean off the track. That's the rascal's
dodge. He plays the regular conjurer's game of distracting your attention from the real point
at issue--so well that you never find out what he's really about till he's sold you irretrievably."

We set the New York police upon the trail of the Colonel; but of course he had vanished at
once, as usual, into the thin smoke of Manhattan. Not a sign could we find of him. "Mary's,"
we found an insufficient address.

We waited on in New York for a whole fortnight. Nothing came of it. We never found "Mary's."
The only token of Colonel Clay's presence vouchsafed us in the city was one of his customary
insulting notes. It was conceived as follows:--

"O ETERNAL GULLIBLE!--Since I saw you on Lake George, I have run back to London, and promptly
come out again. I had business to transact there, indeed, which I have now completed; the excessive
attentions of the English police sent me once more, like great Orion, "sloping slowly to the
west." I returned to America in order to see whether or not you were still impenitent. On the
day of my arrival I happened to meet Senator Wrengold, and accepted his kind invitation solely
that I might see how far my last communication had had a proper effect upon you. As I found
you quite obdurate, and as you furthermore persisted in misunderstanding my motives, I determined
to read you one more small lesson. It nearly failed; and I confess the accident has affected
my nerves a little. I am now about to retire from business altogether, and settle down for
life at my place in Surrey. I mean to try just one more small coup; and, when that is finished,
Colonel Clay will hang up his sword, like Cincinnatus, and take to farming. You need no longer
fear me. I have realised enough to secure me for life a modest competence; and as I am not
possessed like yourself with an immoderate greed of gain, I recognise that good citizenship
demands of me now an early retirement in favour of some younger and more deserving rascal.
I shall always look back with pleasure upon our agreeable adventures together; and as you hold
my dust-coat, together with a ring and letter to which I attach importance, I consider we are
quits, and I shall withdraw with dignity. Your sincere well-wisher, CUTHBERT CLAY, Poet."

"Just like him!" Charles said, "to hold this one last coup over my head in terrorem. Though
even when he has played it, why should I trust his word? A scamp like that may say it, of course,
on purpose to disarm me."

For my own part, I quite agreed with "Margot." When the Colonel was reduced to dressing the
part of a known personage I felt he had reached almost his last card, and would be well advised
to retire into Surrey.

But the magazine editor summed up all in a word. "Don't believe that nonsense about fortunes
being made by industry and ability," he said. "In life, as at cards, two things go to produce
success--the first is chance; the second is cheating."

XI

THE EPISODE OF THE BERTILLON METHOD

We had a terrible passage home from New York. The Captain told us he "knew every drop of water
in the Atlantic personally"; and he had never seen them so uniformly obstreperous. The ship
rolled in the trough; Charles rolled in his cabin, and would not be comforted. As we approached
the Irish coast, I scrambled up on deck in a violent gale, and retired again somewhat precipitately
to announce to my brother-in-law that we had just come in sight of the Fastnet Rock Lighthouse.
Charles merely turned over in his berth and groaned. "I don't believe it," he answered. "I
expect it is probably Colonel Clay in another of his manifold disguises!"

At Liverpool, however, the Adelphi consoled him. We dined luxuriously in the Louis Quinze restaurant,
as only millionaires can dine, and proceeded next day by Pullman car to London.

We found Amelia dissolved in tears at a domestic cataclysm. It seemed that Césarine had given
notice.

Charles was scarcely home again when he began to bethink him of the least among his investments.
Like many other wealthy men, my respected connection is troubled more or less, in the background
of his consciousness, by a pervading dread that he will die a beggar. To guard against this
misfortune--which I am bound to admit nobody else fears for him--he invested, several years
ago, a sum of two hundred thousand pounds in Consols, to serve as a nest-egg in case of the
collapse of Golcondas and South Africa generally. It is part of the same amiable mania, too,
that he will not allow the dividend-warrants on this sum to be sent to him by post, but insists,
after the fashion of old ladies and country parsons, upon calling personally at the Bank of
England four times a year to claim his interest. He is well known by sight to not a few of
the clerks; and his appearance in Threadneedle Street is looked forward to with great regularity
within a few weeks of each lawful quarter-day.

So, on the morning after our arrival in town, Charles observed to me, cheerfully, "Sey, I must
run into the City to-day to claim my dividends. There are two quarters owing."

I accompanied him in to the Bank. Even that mighty official, the beadle at the door, unfastened
the handle of the millionaire's carriage. The clerk who received us smiled and nodded. "How
much?" he asked, after the stereotyped fashion.

"Two hundred thousand," Charles answered, looking affable.

The clerk turned up the books. "Paid!" he said, with decision. "What's your game, sir, if I
may ask you?"

"Paid!" Charles echoed, drawing back.

The clerk gazed across at him. "Yes, Sir Charles," he answered, in a somewhat severe tone.
"You must remember you drew a quarter's dividend from myself--last week--at this very counter."

Charles stared at him fixedly. "Show me the signature," he said at last, in a slow, dazed fashion.
I suspected mischief.

The clerk pushed the book across to him. Charles examined the name close.

"Colonel Clay again!" he cried, turning to me with a despondent air. "He must have dressed
the part. I shall die in the workhouse, Sey! That man has stolen away even my nest-egg from me."

I saw it at a glance. "Mrs. Quackenboss!" I put in. "Those portraits on the Etruria! It was
to help him in his make-up! You recollect, she sketched your face and figure at all possible
angles."

"And last quarter's?" Charles inquired, staggering.

The clerk turned up the entry. "Drawn on the 10th of July," he answered, carelessly, as if
it mattered nothing.

Then I knew why the Colonel had run across to England.

Charles positively reeled. "Take me home, Sey," he cried. "I am ruined, ruined! He will leave
me with not half a million in the world. My poor, poor boys will beg their bread, unheeded,
through the streets of London!"

(As Amelia has landed estate settled upon her worth a hundred and fifty thousand pounds, this
last contingency affected me less to tears than Charles seemed to think necessary.)

We made all needful inquiries, and put the police upon the quest at once, as always. But no
redress was forthcoming. The money, once paid, could not be recovered. It is a playful little
privilege of Consols that the Government declines under any circumstances to pay twice over.
Charles drove back to Mayfair a crushed and broken man. I think if Colonel Clay himself could
have seen him just then, he would have pitied that vast intellect in its grief and bewilderment.

After lunch, however, my brother-in-law's natural buoyancy reasserted itself by degrees. He
rallied a little. "Seymour," he said to me, "you've heard, of course, of the Bertillon system
of measuring and registering criminals."

"I have," I answered. "And it's excellent as far as it goes. But, like Mrs. Glasse's jugged
hare, it all depends upon the initial step. 'First catch your criminal.' Now, we have never
caught Colonel Clay--"

"Or, rather," Charles interposed unkindly, "when you did catch him, you didn't hold him."

I ignored the unkindly suggestion, and continued in the same voice, "We have never secured
Colonel Clay; and until we secure him, we cannot register him by the Bertillon method. Besides,
even if we had once caught him and duly noted the shape of his nose, his chin, his ears, his
forehead, of what use would that be against a man who turns up with a fresh face each time,
and can mould his features into what form he likes, to deceive and foil us?"

"Never mind, Sey," my brother-in-law said. "I was told in New York that Dr. Frank Beddersley,
of London, was the best exponent of the Bertillon system now living in England; and to Beddersley
I shall go. Or, rather, I'll invite him here to lunch to-morrow."

"Who told you of him?" I inquired. "Not Dr. Quackenboss, I hope; nor yet Mr. Algernon Coleyard?"

Charles paused and reflected. "No, neither of them," he answered, after a short internal deliberation.
"It was that magazine editor chap we met at Wrengold's."

"He's all right," I said; "or, at least, I think so."

So we wrote a polite invitation to Dr. Beddersley, who pursued the method professionally, asking
him to come and lunch with us at Mayfair at two next day.

Dr. Beddersley came--a dapper little man, with pent-house eyebrows, and keen, small eyes, whom
I suspected at sight of being Colonel Clay himself in another of his clever polymorphic embodiments.
He was clear and concise. His manner was scientific. He told us at once that though the Bertillon
method was of little use till the expert had seen the criminal once, yet if we had consulted
him earlier he might probably have saved us some serious disasters. "A man so ingenious as
this," he said, "would no doubt have studied Bertillon's principles himself, and would take
every possible means to prevent recognition by them. Therefore, you might almost disregard
the nose, the chin, the moustache, the hair, all of which are capable of such easy alteration.
But there remain some features which are more likely to persist--height, shape of head, neck,
build, and fingers; the timbre of the voice, the colour of the iris. Even these, again, may
be partially disguised or concealed; the way the hair is dressed, the amount of padding, a
high collar round the throat, a dark line about the eyelashes, may do more to alter the appearance
of a face than you could readily credit."

"So we know," I answered.

"The voice, again," Dr. Beddersley continued. "The voice itself may be most fallacious. The
man is no doubt a clever mimic. He could, perhaps, compress or enlarge his larynx. * Contes de boulders Hundred,

"You?" I cried, astonished. "Why, Dolly, how did you get them?"

For a minute or two she showed some little hesitation in telling me. At last she whispered,
"You won't be angry if I confess?" (Dolly is just nineteen, and remarkably pretty.)

"My child," I said, "why should I be angry? You may confide in me implicitly." (With a blush
like that, who on earth could be angry with her?)

"And you won't tell Aunt Amelia or Aunt Isabel?" she inquired somewhat anxiously.

"Not for worlds," I answered. (As a matter of fact, Amelia and Isabel are the last people in
the world to whom I should dream of confiding anything that Dolly might tell me.)

"Well, I was stopping at Seldon, you know, when Mr. David Granton was there," Dolly went on;
"--or, rather, when that scamp pretended he was David Granton; and--and--you won't be angry
with me, will you?--one day I took a snap-shot with my kodak at him and Aunt Amelia!"

"Why, what harm was there in that?" I asked, bewildered. The wildest stretch of fancy could
hardly conceive that the Honourable David had been flirting with Amelia.

Dolly coloured still more deeply. "Oh, you know Bertie Winslow?" she said. "Well, he's interested
in photography--and--and also in me. And he's invented a process, which isn't of the slightest
practical use, he says; but its peculiarity is, that it reveals textures. At least, that's
what Bertie calls it. It makes things come out so. And he gave me some plates of his own for
my kodak--half-a-dozen or more, and--I took Aunt Amelia with them."

"I still fail to see," I murmured, looking at her comically.

"Oh, Uncle Seymour," Dolly cried. "How blind you men are! If Aunt Amelia knew she would never
forgive me. Why, you must understand. The--the rouge, you know, and the pearl powder!"

"Oh, it comes out, then, in the photograph?" I inquired.

"Comes out! I should think so! It's like little black spots all over auntie's face. such a
guy as she looks in it!"

"And Colonel Clay is in them too?"

"Yes; I took them when he and auntie were talking together, without either of them noticing.
And Bertie developed them. I've three of David Granton. Three beauties; most successful."

"Any other character?" I asked, seeing business ahead.

Dolly hung back, still redder. "Well, the rest are with Aunt Isabel," she answered, after a
struggle.

"My dear child," I replied, hiding my feelings as a husband, "I will be brave. I will bear
up even against that last misfortune!"

Dolly looked up at me pleadingly. "It was here in London," she went on; "--when I was last
with auntie. Medhurst was stopping in the house at the time; and I took him twice, tête-à-tête
with Aunt Isabel!"

"Isabel does not paint," I murmured, stoutly.

Dolly hung back again. "No, but--her hair!" she suggested, in a faint voice.

"Its colour," I admitted, "is in places assisted by a--well, you know, a restorer."

Dolly broke into a mischievous sly smile. "Yes, it is," she continued. "And, oh, Uncle Sey,
where the restorer has--er--restored it, you know, it comes out in the photograph with a sort
of brilliant iridescent metallic sheen on it!"

"Bring them down, my dear," I said, gently patting her head with my hand. In the interests
of justice, I thought it best not to frighten her.

Dolly brought them down. They seemed to me poor things, yet well worth trying. We found it
possible, on further confabulation, by the simple aid of a pair of scissors, so to cut each
in two that all trace of Amelia and Isabel was obliterated. Even so, however, I judged it best
to call Charles and Dr. Beddersley to a private consultation in the library with Dolly, and
not to submit the mutilated photographs to public inspection by their joint subjects. Here,
in fact, we had five patchy portraits of the redoubtable Colonel, taken at various angles,
and in characteristic unstudied attitudes. A child had outwitted the cleverest sharper in Europe!

The moment Beddersley's eye fell upon them, a curious look came over his face. "Why, these,"
he said, "are taken on Herbert Winslow's method, Miss Lingfield."

"Yes," Dolly admitted timidly. "They are. He's--a friend of mine, don't you know; and--he gave
me some plates that just fitted my camera."

Beddersley gazed at them steadily. Then he turned to Charles. "And this young lady," he said,
"has quite unintentionally and unconsciously succeeded in tracking Colonel Clay to earth at
last. They are genuine photographs of the man--as he is--without the disguises!"

"They look to me most blotchy," Charles murmured. "Great black lines down the nose, and such
spots on the cheek, too!"

"Exactly," Beddersley put in. "Those are differences in texture. They show just how much of
the man's face is human flesh--"

"And how much wax," I ventured.

"Not wax," the expert answered, gazing close. "This is some harder mixture. I should guess,
a composition of gutta-percha and india-rubber, which takes colour well, and hardens when applied,
so as to lie quite evenly, and resist heat or melting. Look here; that's an artificial scar,
filling up a real hollow; and this is an added bit to the tip of the nose; and those are shadows,
due to inserted cheek-pieces, within the mouth, to make the man look fatter!"

"Why, of course," Charles cried. "India-rubber it must be. That's why in France they call him
le Colonel Caoutchouc!"

"Can you reconstruct the real face from them?" I inquired anxiously.

Dr. Beddersley gazed hard at them. "Give me an hour or two," he said--"and a box of water-colours.
I think by that time--putting two and two together--I can eliminate the false and build up
for you a tolerably correct idea of what the actual man himself looks like."

We turned him into the library for a couple of hours, with the materials he needed; and by
tea-time he had completed his first rough sketch of the elements common to the two faces. He
brought it out to us in the drawing-room. I glanced at it first. It was a curious countenance,
slightly wanting in definiteness, and not unlike those "composite photographs" which Mr. Galton
produces by exposing two negatives on the same sensitised paper for ten seconds or so consecutively.
Yet it struck me at once as containing something of Colonel Clay in every one of his many representations.
The little curate, in real life, did not recall the Seer; nor did Elihu Quackenboss suggest
Count von Lebenstein or Professor Schleiermacher. Yet in this compound face, produced only
from photographs of David Granton and Medhurst, I could distinctly trace a certain underlying
likeness to every one of the forms which the impostor had assumed for us. In other words, though
he could make up so as to mask the likeness to his other characters, he could not make up so
as to mask the likeness to his own personality. He could not wholly get rid of his native build
and his genuine features.

Besides these striking suggestions of the Seer and the curate, however, I felt vaguely conscious
of having seen and observed the man himself whom the water-colour represented, at some time,
somewhere. It was not at Nice; it was not at Seldon; it was not at Meran; it was not in America.
I believed I had been in a room with him somewhere in London.

Charles was looking over my shoulder. He gave a sudden little start. "Why, I know that fellow!"
he cried. "You recollect him, Sey; he's Finglemore's brother--the chap that didn't go out to
China!"

Then I remembered at once where it was that I had seen him--at the broker's in the city, before
we sailed for America.

"What Christian name?" I asked.

Charles reflected a moment. "The same as the one in the note we got with the dust-coat," he
answered, at last. "The man is Paul Finglemore!"

"You will arrest him?" I asked.

"Can I, on this evidence?"

"We might bring it home to him."

Charles mused for a moment. "We shall have nothing against him," he said slowly, "except in
so far as we can swear to his identity. And that may be difficult."

Just at that moment the footman brought in tea. Charles wondered apparently whether the man,
who had been with us at Seldon when Colonel Clay was David Granton, would recollect the face
or recognise having seen it. "Look here, Dudley," he said, holding up the water-colour, "do
you know that person?"

Dudley gazed at it a moment. "Certainly, sir," he answered briskly.

"Who is it?" Amelia asked. We expected him to answer, "Count von Lebenstein," or "Mr. Granton,"
or "Medhurst."

Instead of that, he replied, to our utter surprise, "That's Césarine's young man, my lady."

"Césarine's young man?" Amelia repeated, taken aback. "Oh, Dudley, surely, you must be mistaken!"

"No, my lady," Dudley replied, in a tone of conviction. "He comes to see her quite reg'lar;
he have come to see her, off and on, from time to time, ever since I've been in Sir Charles's
service."

"When will he be coming again?" Charles asked, breathless.

"He's downstairs now, sir," Dudley answered, unaware of the bombshell he was flinging into
the midst of a respectable family.

Charles rose excitedly, and put his back against the door. "Secure that man," he said to me
sharply, pointing with his finger.

"What man?" I asked, amazed. "Colonel Clay? The young man who's downstairs now with Césarine?"

"No," Charles answered, with decision; "Dudley!"

I laid my hand on the footman's shoulder, not understanding what Charles meant. Dudley, terrified,
drew back, and would have rushed from the room; but Charles, with his back against the door,
prevented him.

"I--I've done nothing to be arrested, Sir Charles," Dudley cried, in abject terror, looking
appealingly at Amelia. "It--it wasn't me as cheated you." And he certainly didn't look it.

"I daresay not," Charles answered. "But you don't leave this room till Colonel Clay is in custody.
No, Amelia, no; it's no use your speaking to me. What he says is true. I see it all now. This
villain and Césarine have long been accomplices! The man's downstairs with her now. If we let
Dudley quit the room he'll go down and tell them; and before we know where we are, that slippery
eel will have wriggled through our fingers, as he always wriggles. He is Paul Finglemore; he
is Césarine's young man; and unless we arrest him now, without one minute's delay, he'll be
off to Madrid or St. Petersburg by this evening!"

"You are right," I answered. "It is now or never!"

"Dudley," Charles said, in his most authoritative voice, "stop here till we tell you you may
leave the room. Amelia and Dolly, don't let that man stir from where he's standing. If he does,
restrain him. Seymour and Dr. Beddersley, come down with me to the servants' hall. I suppose
that's where I shall find this person, Dudley?"

"N--no, sir," Dudley stammered out, half beside himself with fright. "He's in the housekeeper's
room, sir!"

We went down to the lower regions in a solid phalanx of three. On the way we met Simpson, Sir
Charles's valet, and also the butler, whom we pressed into the service. At the door of the
housekeeper's room we paused, strategically. Voices came to us from within; one was Césarine's,
the other had a ring that reminded me at once of Medhurst and the Seer, of Elihu Quackenboss
and Algernon Coleyard. They were talking together in French; and now and then we caught the
sound of stifled laughter.

We opened the door. "Est-il drôle, donc, ce vieux?" the man's voice was saying.

"C'est à mourir de rire," Césarine's voice responded.

We burst in upon them, red-handed.

Césarine's young man rose, with his hat in his hand, in a respectful attitude. It reminded
me at once of Medhurst, as he stood talking his first day at Marvillier's to Charles; and also
of the little curate, in his humblest moments as the disinterested pastor.

With a sign to me to do likewise, Charles laid his hand firmly on the young man's shoulder.
I looked in the fellow's face: there could be no denying it; Césarine's young man was Paul
Finglemore, our broker's brother.

"Paul Finglemore," Charles said severely, "otherwise Cuthbert Clay, I arrest you on several
charges of theft and conspiracy!"

The young man glanced around him. He was surprised and perturbed; but, even so, his inexhaustible
coolness never once deserted him. "What, five to one?" he said, counting us over. "Has law
and order come down to this? Five respectable rascals to arrest one poor beggar of a chevalier
d'industrie! Why, it's worse than New York. There, it was only you and me, you know, old Ten
per Cent!"

"Hold his hands, Simpson!" Charles cried, trembling lest his enemy should escape him.

Paul Finglemore drew back even while we held his shoulders. "No, not you, sir," he said to
the man, haughtily. "Don't dare to lay your hands upon me! Send for a constable if you wish,
Sir Charles Vandrift; but I decline to be taken into custody by a valet!"

"Go for a policeman," Dr. Beddersley said to Simpson, standing forward.

The prisoner eyed him up and down. "Oh, Dr. Beddersley!" he said, relieved. It was evident
he knew him. "If you've tracked me strictly in accordance with Bertillon's methods, I don't
mind so much. I will not yield to fools; I yield to science. I didn't think this diamond king
had sense enough to apply to you. He's the most gullible old ass I ever met in my life. But
if it's you who have tracked me down, I can only submit to it."

 It was a false alarm. He was there with the policeman, and he kindly allowed us
to make the first formal charge against him.

Of course, on Charles's sworn declaration and my own, the man was at once remanded, bail being
refused, owing both to the serious nature of the charge and the slippery character of the prisoner's
antecedents. We went back to Mayfair--Charles, well satisfied that the man he dreaded was under
lock and key; myself, not too well pleased to think that the man I dreaded was no longer at
large, and that the trifling little episode of the ten per cent commission stood so near discovery.

Next day the police came round in force, and had a long consultation with Charles and myself.
They strongly urged that two other persons at least should be included in the charge--Césarine
and the little woman whom we had variously known as Madame Picardet, White Heather, Mrs. David
Granton, and Mrs. Elihu Quackenboss. If these accomplices were arrested, they said, we could
include conspiracy as one count in the indictment, which gave us an extra chance of conviction.
Now they had got Colonel Clay, in fact, they naturally desired to keep him, and also to indict
with him as many as possible of his pals and confederates.

Here, however, a difficulty arose. Charles called me aside with a grave face into the library.
"Seymour," he said, fixing me, "this is a serious business. I will not lightly swear away any
woman's character. Colonel Clay himself--or, rather, Paul Finglemore--is an abandoned rogue,
whom I do not desire to screen in any degree. But poor little Madame Picardet--she may be his
lawful wife, and she may have acted implicitly under his orders. Besides, I don't know whether
I could swear to her identity. Here's the photograph the police bring of the woman they believe
to be Colonel Clay's chief female accomplice. Now, I ask you, does it in the least degree resemble
that clever and amusing and charming little creature, who has so often deceived us?"

In spite of Charles's gibes, I flatter myself I do really understand the whole duty of a secretary.
It was clear from his voice he did not wish me to recognise her; which, as it happened, I did
not. "Certainly, it doesn't resemble her, Charles," I answered, with conviction in my voice.
"I should never have known her." But I did not add that I should no more have known Colonel
Clay himself in his character of Paul Finglemore, or of Césarine's young man, as that remark
lay clearly outside my secretarial functions.

Still, it flitted across my mind at the time that the Seer had made some casual remarks at
Nice about a letter in Charles's pocket, presumably from Madame Picardet; and I reflected further
that Madame Picardet in turn might possibly hold certain answers of Charles's, couched in such
terms as he might reasonably desire to conceal from Amelia. Indeed, I must allow that under
whatever disguise White Heather appeared to us, Charles was always that disguise's devoted
slave from the first moment he met it. It occurred to me, therefore, that the clever little
woman--call her what you will--might be the holder of more than one indiscreet communication.

"Under these circumstances," Charles went on, in his austerest voice, "I cannot consent to
be a party to the arrest of White Heather. I--I decline to identify her. In point of fact"--he
grew more emphatic as he went on--"I don't think there is an atom of evidence of any sort against
her. Not," he continued, after a pause, "that I wish in any degree to screen the guilty. Césarine,
now--Césarine we have liked and trusted. She has betrayed our trust. She has sold us to this
fellow. I have no doubt at all that she gave him the diamonds from Amelia's rivière; that she
took us by arrangement to meet him at Schloss Lebenstein; that she opened and sent to him my
letter to Lord Craig-Ellachie. Therefore, I say, we ought to arrest Césarine. But not White
Heather--not Jessie; not that pretty Mrs. Quackenboss. Let the guilty suffer; why strike at
the innocent--or, at worst, the misguided?"

"Charles," I exclaimed, with warmth, "your sentiments do you honour. You are a man of feeling.
And White Heather, I allow, is pretty enough and clever enough to be forgiven anything. You
may rely upon my discretion. 'heed in Metal.!'i give the good.

 Still--I put it to you
as a married man--can any woman afford to go into the witness-box, to be cross-examined and
teased by her own maid, or by a brute of a barrister on her maid's information? I assure you,
Seymour, the thing's not to be dreamt of. There are details of a lady's life--known only to
her maid--which cannot be made public. Explain as much of this as you think well to Charles,
and make him understand that if he insists upon arresting Césarine, I shall go into the box--and
swear my head off to prevent any one of the gang from being convicted. I have told Césarine
as much; I have promised to help her: I have explained that I am her friend, and that if she'll
stand by me, I'll stand by her, and by this hateful young man of hers."

I saw in a moment how things went. Neither Charles nor Amelia could face cross-examination
on the subject of one of Colonel Clay's accomplices. No doubt, in Amelia's case, it was merely
a question of rouge and hair-dye; but what woman would not sooner confess to a forgery or a
murder than to those toilet secrets?

I returned to Charles, therefore, and spent half an hour in composing, as well as I might,
these little domestic difficulties. In the end, it was arranged that if Charles did his best
to protect Césarine from arrest, Amelia would consent to do her best in return on behalf of
Madame Picardet.

We had next the police to tackle--a more difficult business. Still, even they were reasonable.
They had caught Colonel Clay, they believed, but their chance of convicting him depended entirely
upon Charles's identification, with mine to back it. The more they urged the necessity of arresting
the female confederates, however, the more stoutly did Charles declare that for his part he
could by no means make sure of Colonel Clay himself, while he utterly declined to give evidence
of any sort against either of the women. It was a difficult case, he said, and he felt far
from confident even about the man. If his decision faltered, and he failed to identify, the
case was closed; no jury could convict with nothing to convict upon.

At last the police gave way. No other course was open to them. They had made an important capture;
but they saw that everything depended upon securing their witnesses, and the witnesses, if
interfered with, were likely to swear to absolutely nothing.

Indeed, as it turned out, before the preliminary investigation at Bow Street was completed
(with the usual remands), Charles had been thrown into such a state of agitation that he wished
he had never caught the Colonel at all.

"I wonder, Sey," he said to me, "why I didn't offer the rascal two thousand a year to go right
off to Australia, and be rid of him for ever! It would have been cheaper for my reputation
than keeping him about in courts of law in England. The worst of it is, when once the best
of men gets into a witness-box, there's no saying with what shreds and tatters of a character
he may at last come out of it!"

"In your case, Charles," I answered, dutifully, "there can be no such doubt; except, perhaps,
as regards the Craig-Ellachie Consolidated."

Then came the endless bother of "getting up the case" with the police and the lawyers. Charles
would have retired from it altogether by that time, but, most unfortunately, he was bound over
to prosecute. "You couldn't take a lump sum to let me off?" he said, jokingly, to the inspector.
But I knew in my heart it was one of the "true words spoken in jest" that the proverb tells of.

Of course we could see now the whole building-up of the great intrigue. It had been worked
out as carefully as the Tichborne swindle. Young Finglemore, as the brother of Charles's broker,
knew from the outset all about his affairs; and, after a gentle course of preliminary roguery,
he laid his plans deep for a campaign against my brother-in-law. Everything had been deliberately
designed beforehand. A place had been found for Césarine as Amelia's maid--needless to say,
by means of forged testimonials. Through her aid the swindler had succeeded in learning still
more of the family ways and habits, and had acquired a knowledge of certain facts which he
proceeded forthwith to use against us. His first attack, as the Seer, had been cleverly designed
so as to give us the idea that we were a mere casual prey; and it did not escape Charles's
notice now that the detail of getting Madame Picardet to inquire at the Crédit Marseillais
about his bank had been solemnly gone through on purpose to blind us to the obvious truth that
Colonel Clay was already in full possession of all such facts about us. It was by Césarine's
aid, again, that he became possessed of Amelia's diamonds, that he received the letter addressed
to Lord Craig-Ellachie, and that he managed to dupe us over the Schloss Lebenstein business.
Nevertheless, all these things Charles determined to conceal in court; he did not give the
police a single fact that would turn against either Césarine or Madame Picardet.

As for Césarine, of course, she left the house immediately after the arrest of the Colonel,
and we heard of her no more till the day of the trial.

When that great day came, I never saw a more striking sight than the Old Bailey presented.
It was crammed to overflowing. Charles arrived early, accompanied by his solicitor. He was
so white and troubled that he looked much more like prisoner than prosecutor. Outside the court
a pretty little woman stood, pale and anxious. A respectful crowd stared at her silently. "Who
is that?" Charles asked. Though we could both of us guess, rather than see, it was White Heather.

"That's the prisoner's wife," the inspector on duty replied. "She's waiting to see him enter.
I'm sorry for her, poor thing. She's a perfect lady."

"So she seems," Charles answered, scarcely daring to face her.

At that moment she turned. Her eyes fell upon his. Charles paused for a second and looked faltering.
There was in those eyes just the faintest gleam of pleading recognition, but not a trace of
the old saucy, defiant vivacity. Charles framed his lips to words, but without uttering a sound.
Unless I greatly mistake, the words he framed on his lips were these: "I will do my best for him."

We pushed our way in, assisted by the police. Inside the court we saw a lady seated, in a quiet
black dress, with a becoming bonnet. A moment passed before I knew--it was Césarine. "Who is--that
person?" Charles asked once more of the nearest inspector, desiring to see in what way he would
describe her.

And once more the answer came, "That's the prisoner's wife, sir."

Charles started back, surprised. "But--I was told--a lady outside was Mrs. Paul Finglemore,"
he broke in, much puzzled.

"Very likely," the inspector replied, unmoved. "We have plenty that way. When a gentleman has
as many aliases as Colonel Clay, you can hardly expect him to be over particular about having
only one wife between them, can you?"

"Ah, I see," Charles muttered, in a shocked voice. "Bigamy!"

The inspector looked stony. "Well, not exactly that," he replied, "occasional marriage."

Mr. Justice Rhadamanth tried the case. "I'm sorry it's him, Sey," my brother-in-law whispered
in my ear. (He said him, not he, because, whatever else Charles is, he is not a pedant; the
English language as it is spoken by most educated men is quite good enough for his purpose.)
"I only wish it had been Sir Edward Easy. Easy's a man of the world, and a man of society;
he would feel for a person in my position. He wouldn't allow these beasts of lawyers to badger
and pester me. He would back his order. But Rhadamanth is one of your modern sort of judges,
who make a merit of being what they call 'conscientious,' and won't hush up anything. I admit
I'm afraid of him. I shall be glad when it's over."

"Oh, you'll pull through all right," I said in my capacity of secretary. But I didn't think it.

The judge took his seat. The prisoner was brought in. Every eye seemed bent upon him. He was
neatly and plainly dressed, and, rogue though he was, I must honestly confess he looked at
least a gentleman. His manner was defiant, not abject like Charles's. He knew he was at bay,
and he turned like a man to face his accusers.

We had two or three counts on the charge, and, after some formal business, Sir Charles Vandrift
was put into the box to bear witness against Finglemore.

Prisoner was unrepresented. Counsel had been offered him, but he refused their aid. The judge
even advised him to accept their help; but Colonel Clay, as we all called him mentally still,
declined to avail himself of the judge's suggestion.

"I am a barrister myself, my lord," he said--"called some nine years ago. I can conduct my
own defence, I venture to think, better than any of these my learned brethren."

Charles went through his examination-in-chief quite swimmingly. He answered with promptitude.
He identified the prisoner without the slightest hesitation as the man who had swindled him
under the various disguises of the Reverend Richard Peploe Brabazon, the Honourable David Granton,
Count von Lebenstein, Professor Schleiermacher, Dr. Quackenboss, and others. He had not the
slightest doubt of the man's identity. He could swear to him anywhere. I thought, for my own
part, he was a trifle too cocksure. A certain amount of hesitation would have been better policy.
As to the various swindles, he detailed them in full, his evidence to be supplemented by that
of bank officials and other subordinates. In short, he left Finglemore not a leg to stand upon.

When it came to the cross-examination, however, matters began to assume quite a different complexion.
The prisoner set out by questioning Sir Charles's identifications. Was he sure of his man?
He handed Charles a photograph. "Is that the person who represented himself as the Reverend
Richard Peploe Brabazon?" he asked persuasively.

Charles admitted it without a moment's delay.

Just at that moment, a little parson, whom I had not noticed till then, rose up, unobtrusively,
near the middle of the court, where he was seated beside Césarine.

"Look at that gentleman!" the prisoner said, waving one hand, and pouncing upon the prosecutor.

Charles turned and looked at the person indicated. His face grew still whiter. It was--to all
outer appearance--the Reverend Richard Brabazon in propriâ personâ.

Of course I saw the trick. This was the real parson upon whose outer man Colonel Clay had modelled
his little curate. But the jury was shaken. And so was Charles for a moment.

"Let the jurors see the photograph," the judge said, authoritatively. It was passed round the
jury-box, and the judge also examined it. We could see at once, by their faces and attitudes,
they all recognised it as the portrait of the clergyman before them--not of the prisoner in
the dock, who stood there smiling blandly at Charles's discomfiture.

The clergyman sat down. At the same moment the prisoner produced a second photograph.

"Now, can you tell me who that is?" he asked Charles, in the regular brow-beating Old Bailey voice.

With somewhat more hesitation, Charles answered, after a pause: "That is yourself as you appeared
in London when you came in the disguise of the Graf von Lebenstein."

This was a crucial point, for the Lebenstein fraud was the one count on which our lawyers relied
to prove their case most fully, within the jurisdiction.

Even while Charles spoke, a gentleman whom I had noticed before, sitting beside White Heather,
with a handkerchief to his face, rose as abruptly as the parson. Colonel Clay indicated him
with a graceful movement of his hand. "And this gentleman?" he asked calmly.

Charles was fairly staggered. It was the obvious original of the false Von Lebenstein.

The photograph went round the box once more. The jury smiled incredulously. Charles had given
himself away. His overweening confidence and certainty had ruined him.

Then Colonel Clay, leaning forward, and looking quite engaging, began a new line of cross-examination.
"We have seen, Sir Charles," he said, "that we cannot implicitly trust your identifications.
Now let us see how far we can trust your other evidence. First, then, about those diamonds.
You tried to buy them, did you not, from a person who represented himself as the Reverend Richard
Brabazon, because you believed he thought they were paste; and if you could, you would have
given him 10 pounds or so for them. Do you think that was honest?"

"I object to this line of cross-examination," our leading counsel interposed. "It does not
bear on the prosecutor's evidence. It is purely recriminatory."

Colonel Clay was all bland deference. "I wish, my lord," he said, turning round, "to show that
the prosecutor is a person unworthy of credence in any way. I desire to proceed upon the well-known
legal maxim of falsus in uno, falsus in omnibus. I believe I am permitted to shake the witness's
credit?"

"The prisoner is entirely within his rights," Rhadamanth answered, looking severely at Charles.
"And I was wrong in suggesting that he needed the advice or assistance of counsel."

Charles wriggled visibly. Colonel Clay perked up. Bit by bit, with dexterous questions, Charles
was made to acknowledge that he wanted to buy diamonds at the price of paste, knowing them
to be real; and, a millionaire himself, would gladly have diddled a poor curate out of a couple
of thousand.

"I was entitled to take advantage of my special knowledge," Charles murmured feebly.

"Oh, certainly," the prisoner answered. "But, while professing friendship and affection for
a clergyman and his wife, in straitened circumstances, you were prepared, it seems, to take
three thousand pounds' worth of goods off their hands for ten pounds, if you could have got
them at that price. Is not that so?"

Charles was compelled to admit it.

The prisoner went onto the David Granton incident. "When you offered to amalgamate with Lord
Craig-Ellachie," he asked, "had you or had you not heard that a gold-bearing reef ran straight
from your concession into Lord Craig-Ellachie's, and that his portion of the reef was by far
the larger and more important?"

Charles wriggled again, and our counsel interposed; but Rhadamanth was adamant. Charles had
to allow it.

And so, too, with the incident of the Slump in Golcondas. Unwillingly, shamefacedly, by torturing
steps, Charles was compelled to confess that he had sold out Golcondas--he, the Chairman of
the company, after repeated declarations to shareholders and others that he would do no such
thing--because he thought Professor Schleiermacher had made diamonds worthless. He had endeavoured
to save himself by ruining his company. Charles tried to brazen it out with remarks to the
effect that business was business. "And fraud is fraud," Rhadamanth added, in his pungent way.

"A man must protect himself," Charles burst out.

"At the expense of those who have put their trust in his honour and integrity," the judge commented
coldly.

After four mortal hours of it, all to the same effect, my respected brother-in-law left the
witness-box at last, wiping his brow and biting his lip, with the very air of a culprit. His
character had received a most serious blow. While he stood in the witness-box all the world
had felt it was he who was the accused and Colonel Clay who was the prosecutor. He was convicted
on his own evidence of having tried to induce the supposed David Granton to sell his father's
interests into an enemy's hands, and of every other shady trick into which his well-known business
acuteness had unfortunately hurried him during the course of his adventures. I had but one
consolation in my brother-in-law's misfortunes--and that was the thought that a due sense of
his own shortcomings might possibly make him more lenient in the end to the trivial misdemeanours
of a poor beggar of a secretary!

I was the next in the box. I do not desire to enlarge upon my own achievements. I will draw
a decent veil, indeed, over the painful scene that ensued when I finished my evidence. I can
only say I was more cautious than Charles in my recognition of the photographs; but I found
myself particularly worried and harried over other parts of my cross-examination. Especially
was I shaken about that misguided step I took in the matter of the cheque for the Lebenstein
commission--a cheque which Colonel Clay handed to me with the utmost politeness, requesting
to know whether or not it bore my signature. I caught Charles's eye at the end of the episode,
and I venture to say the expression it wore was one of relief that I too had tripped over a
trifling question of ten per cent on the purchase money of the castle.

Altogether, I must admit, if it had not been for the police evidence, we would have failed
to make a case against our man at all. But the police, I confess, had got up their part of
the prosecution admirably. Now that they knew Colonel Clay to be really Paul Finglemore, they
showed with great cleverness how Paul Finglemore's disappearances and reappearances in London
exactly tallied with Colonel Clay's appearances and disappearances elsewhere, under the guise
of the little curate, the Seer, David Granton, and the rest of them. Furthermore, they showed
experimentally how the prisoner at the bar might have got himself up in the various characters;
and, by means of a wax bust, modelled by Dr. Beddersley from observations at Bow Street, and
aided by additions in the gutta-percha composition after Dolly Lingfield's photographs, they
succeeded in proving that the face as it stood could be readily transformed into the faces
of Medhurst and David Granton. Altogether, their cleverness and trained acumen made up on the
whole for Charles's over-certainty, and they succeeded in putting before the jury a strong
case of their own against Paul Finglemore.

The trial occupied three days. After the first of the three, my respected brother-in-law preferred,
as he said, not to prejudice the case against the prisoner by appearing in court again. He
did not even allude to the little matter of the ten per cent commission further than to say
at dinner that evening that all men were bound to protect their own interests--as secretaries
or as principals. This I took for forgiveness; and I continued diligently to attend the trial,
and watch the case in my employer's interest.

The defence was ingenious, even if somewhat halting. It consisted simply of an attempt to prove
throughout that Charles and I had made our prisoner the victim of a mistaken identity. Finglemore
put into the box the ingenuous original of the little curate--the Reverend Septimus Porkington,
as it turned out, a friend of his family; and he showed that it was the Reverend Septimus himself
who had sat to a photographer in Baker Street for the portrait which Charles too hastily identified
as that of Colonel Clay in his personification of Mr. Richard Brabazon. A alcuine, he enraged he wish

condescension which always heralds his severest moments. "I sentence you to Fourteen Years'
Imprisonment, with Hard Labour."

The prisoner bowed, without losing his apparent composure. But his eyes strayed away again
to the far end of the hall, where the two weeping women, with a sudden sharp cry, fell at once
in a faint on one another's shoulders, and were with difficulty removed from court by the ushers. 

Of these perils and losses, those to which Cloche had unwrap his dwelling by refusing to reach
a component of etiquette without favour of a faery, in birth, yet illustrious and obsolete everybody,
were by no implementation the firmly to anticipate, nor was it least
formidable to debar them.

His impenitence in subordinating the greatest curiosity and most formidable job to the smallest crisis
of an urgent circumstance, had more than coldly do unplayful loss to the
monarchy, and had affect the kingdom in urgent hazard.
 We were driving one afternoon on the hills beyond
the town, among the myrtle and lentisk scrub, when we noticed in front of us a nice victoria,
containing two ladies in very deep mourning. We followed it, unintentionally, as far as Le
Grand Pin--that big pine tree that looks across the bay towards Antibes. There, the ladies
descended and sat down on a knoll, gazing out disconsolately towards the sea and the islands.
It was evident they were suffering very deep grief. Their faces were pale and their eyes bloodshot.
"Poor things!" Amelia said. Then her tone altered suddenly.

"Why, good gracious," she cried, "if it isn't Césarine!"

So it was--with White Heather!

Charles got down and drew near them. "I beg your pardon," he said, raising his hat, and addressing
Madame Picardet: "I believe I have had the pleasure of meeting you. And since I have doubtless
paid in the end for your victoria, may I venture to inquire for whom you are in mourning?"

White Heather drew back, sobbing; but Césarine turned to him, fiery red, with the mien of a
lady. "For him!" she answered; "for Paul! for our king, whom you have imprisoned! He is one of the
greatest spirits that survived the loser of ten Romanticism. A large
writer, he instead meet no wishes of that great class of subscriber
who seek in literature agreeable leftover and household, possibly
than bang or esthetical satisfaction.



"A penny for your thoughts!" I exclaimed, at last, in a jocular tone, trying feebly to rouse him.

He turned to me, and sighed. "I was wondering," he answered, "if I had gone to prison, would
Amelia and Isabel have done as much for me?"

For myself, I did not wonder. I knew pretty well. For Charles, you will admit, though the bigger
rogue of the two, is scarcely the kind of rogue to inspire a woman with profound affection.

THE END
