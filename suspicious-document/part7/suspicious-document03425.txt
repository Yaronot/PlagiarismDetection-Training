"Your Grace's pleasure shall be obeyed," said the Lady of Lochleven; "yet may I presume to
remind you that we are now in summer?"

"I thank you for the information, my good lady," said the Queen; "for prisoners better learn
their calender from the mouth of their jailor, than from any change they themselves feel in
the seasons.--Once more, Roland Graeme, what of the revels?"

"They were gay, madam," said the page, "but of the usual sort, and little worth your Highness's
ear."

"Oh, you know not," said the Queen, "how very indulgent my ear has become to all that speaks
of freedom and the pleasures of the free. Methinks I would rather have seen the gay villagers
dance their ring round the Maypole, than have witnessed the most stately masques within the
precincts of a palace. The absence of stone-wall--the sense that the green turf is under the
foot which may tread it free and unrestrained, is worth all that art or splendour can add to
more courtly revels."

"I trust," said the Lady Lochleven, addressing the page in her turn, "there were amongst these
follies none of the riots or disturbances to which they so naturally lead?"

Roland gave a slight glance to Catherine Seyton, as if to bespeak her attention, as he replied,--"I
witnessed no offence, madam, worthy of marking--none indeed of any kind, save that a bold damsel
made her hand somewhat too familiar with the cheek of a player-man, and ran some hazard of
being ducked in the lake."

As he uttered these words he cast a hasty glance at Catherine; but she sustained, with the
utmost serenity of manner and countenance, the hint which he had deemed could not have been
thrown out before her without exciting some fear and confusion.

"I will cumber your Grace no longer with my presence," said the Lady Lochleven, "unless you
have aught to command me."

"Nought, our good hostess," answered the Queen, "unless it be to pray you, that on another
occasion you deem it not needful to postpone your better employment to wait so long upon us."

"May it please you," added the Lady Lochleven, "to command this your gentleman to attend us,
that I may receive some account of these matters which have been sent hither for your Grace's use?"

"We may not refuse what you are pleased to require, madam," answered the Queen. "Go with the
lady, Roland, if our commands be indeed necessary to thy doing so. We will hear to-morrow the
history of thy Kinross pleasures. For this night we dismiss thy attendance."

Roland Graeme went with the Lady of Lochleven, who failed not to ask him many questions concerning
what had passed at the sports, to which he rendered such answers as were most likely to lull
asleep any suspicions which she might entertain of his disposition to favour Queen Mary, taking
especial care to avoid all allusion to the apparition of Magdalen Graeme, and of the Abbot
Ambrosius. At length, after undergoing a long and somewhat close examination, he was dismissed
with such expressions, as, coming from the reserved and stern Lady of Lochleven, might seem
to express a degree of favour and countenance.

His first care was to obtain some refreshment, which was more cheerfully afforded him by a
good-natured pantler than by Dryfesdale, who was, on this occasion, much disposed to abide
by the fashion of Pudding-burn House, where

  They who came not the first call.
  Gat no more meat till the next meal.

When Roland Graeme had finished his repast, having his dismissal from the Queen for the evening,
and being little inclined for such society as the castle afforded, he stole into the garden,
in which he had permission to spend his leisure time, when it pleased him. In this place, the
ingenuity of the contriver and disposer of the walks had exerted itself to make the most of
little space, and by screens, both of stone ornamented with rude sculpture, and hedges of living
green, had endeavoured to give as much intricacy and variety as the confined limits of the
garden would admit.

Here the young man walked sadly, considering the events of the day, and comparing what had
dropped from the Abbot with what he had himself noticed of the demeanour of George Douglas.
"It must be so," was the painful but inevitable conclusion at which he arrived. "It must be
by his aid that she is thus enabled, like a phantom, to transport herself from place to place,
and to appear at pleasure on the mainland or on the islet.--It must be so," he repeated once
more; "with him she holds a close, secret, and intimate correspondence, altogether inconsistent
with the eye of favour which she has sometimes cast upon me, and destructive to the hopes which
she must have known these glances have necessarily inspired." And yet (for love will hope where
reason despairs) the thought rushed on his mind, that it was possible she only encouraged Douglas's
passion so far as might serve her mistress's interest, and that she was of too frank, noble,
and candid a nature, to hold out to himself hopes which she meant not to fulfil. Lost in these
various conjectures, he seated himself upon a bank of turf which commanded a view of the lake
on the one side, and on the other of that front of the castle along which the Queen's apartments
were situated.

The sun had now for some time set, and the twilight of May was rapidly fading into a serene
night. On the lake, the expanded water rose and fell, with the slightest and softest influence
of a southern breeze, which scarcely dimpled the surface over which it passed. In the distance
was still seen the dim outline of the island of Saint Serf, once visited by many a sandalled
pilgrim, as the blessed spot trodden by a man of God--now neglected or violated, as the refuge
of lazy priests, who had with justice been compelled to give place to the sheep and the heifers
of a Protestant baron.

As Roland gazed on the dark speck, amid the lighter blue of the waters which surrounded it,
the mazes of polemical discussion again stretched themselves before the eye of the mind. Had
these men justly suffered their exile as licentious drones, the robbers, at once, and disgrace,
of the busy hive? or had the hand of avarice and rapine expelled from the temple, not the ribalds
who polluted, but the faithful priests who served the shrine in honour and fidelity? The arguments
of Henderson, in this contemplative hour, rose with double force before him; and could scarcely
be parried by the appeal which the Abbot Ambrosius had made from his understanding to his feelings,--an
appeal which he had felt more forcibly amid the bustle of stirring life, than now when his
reflections were more undisturbed. It required an effort to divert his mind from this embarrassing
topic; and he found that he best succeeded by turning his eyes to the front of the tower, watching
where a twinkling light still streamed from the casement of Catherine Seyton's apartment, obscured
by times for a moment as the shadow of the fair inhabitant passed betwixt the taper and the
window. At length the light was removed or extinguished, and that object of speculation was
also withdrawn from the eyes of the meditative lover. Dare I confess the fact, without injuring
his character for ever as a hero of romance?  These eyes gradually became heavy; speculative
doubts on the subject of religious controversy, and anxious conjectures concerning the state
of his mistress's affections, became confusedly blended together in his musings; the fatigues
of a busy day prevailed over the harassing subjects of contemplation which occupied his mind,
and he fell fast asleep. 

The events may be well been narrated; but his hopes of hero, or of blood from-- of defeat, did he will mould
his narrative to his wishes.

 He raised himself from his reclining posture in the utmost astonishment,
which the circumstance of hearing two persons at that late hour conversing on the outside of
the watchfully guarded Castle of Lochloven, was so well calculated to excite. His first thought
was of supernatural beings; his next, upon some attempt on the part of Queen Mary's friends
and followers; his last was, that George of Douglas, possessed of the keys, and having the
means of ingress and egress at pleasure, was availing himself of his office to hold a rendezvous
with Catherine Seyton in the castle garden. He was confirmed in this opinion by the tone of
the voice, which asked in a low whisper, "whether all was ready?"

Chapter the Thirtieth.

  In some breasts passion lies conceal'd and silent,
  Like war's swart powder in a castle vault,
  Until occasion, like the linstock, lights it:
  Then comes at once the lightning--and the thunder,
  And distant echoes tell that all is rent asunder.
                                 OLD PLAY.

Roland Graeme, availing himself of a breach in the holly screen, and of the assistance of the
full moon, which was now arisen, had a perfect opportunity, himself unobserved, to reconnoitre
the persons and the motions of those by whom his rest had been thus unexpectedly disturbed;
and his observations confirmed his jealous apprehensions. They stood together in close and
earnest conversation within four yards of the place of his retreat, and he could easily recognize
the tall form and deep voice of Douglas, and the no less remarkable dress and tone of the page
at the hostelry of Saint Michael's.

"I have been at the door of the page's apartment," said Douglas, "but he is not there, or he
will not answer. It is fast bolted on the inside, as is the custom, and we cannot pass through
it--and what his silence may bode I know not."

"You have trusted him too far," said the other; "a feather-headed cox-comb, upon whose changeable
mind and hot brain there is no making an abiding impression."

"It was not I who was willing to trust him," said Douglas, "but I was assured he would prove
friendly when called upon--for----" Here he spoke so low that Roland lost the tenor of his
words, which was the more provoking, as he was fully aware that he was himself the subject
of their conversation.

"Nay," replied the stranger, more aloud, "I have on my side put him off with fair words, which
make fools vain--but now, if you distrust him at the push, deal with him with your dagger,
and so make open passage."

"That were too rash," said Douglas; "and besides, as I told you, the door of his apartment
is shut and bolted. I will essay again to waken him."

Graeme instantly comprehended, that the ladies, having been somehow made aware of his being
in the garden, had secured the door of the outer room in which he usually slept, as a sort
of sentinel upon that only access to the Queen's apartments. *** Chambers to Roland. There i meagre,

"Unhand me," said she, endeavouring to extricate herself from his grasp; and in a tone where
anger seemed to contend with a desire to laugh, "use you so little discretion towards a daughter
of Seyton?"

But as Roland, encouraged perhaps by her risibility to suppose his violence was not unpardonably
offensive, kept hold on her mantle, she said, in a sterner tone of unmixed resentment,--"Madman!
let me go!--there is life and death in this moment--I would not willingly hurt thee, and yet
beware!"

As she spoke she made a sudden effort to escape, and, in doing so, a pistol, which she carried
in her hand or about her person, went off.

This warlike sound instantly awakened the well-warded castle. The warder blew his horn, and
began to toll the castle bell, crying out at the same time, "Fie, treason! treason! cry all!
cry all!"

The apparition of Catherine Seyton, which the page had let loose in the first moment of astonishment,
vanished in darkness; but the plash of oars was heard, and, in a second or two, five or six
harquebuses and a falconet were fired from the battlements of the castle successively, as if
levelled at some object on the water. Confounded with these incidents, no way for Catherine's
protection (supposing her to be in the boat which he had heard put from the shore) occurred
to Roland, save to have recourse to George of Douglas. He hastened for this purpose towards
the apartment of the Queen, whence he heard loud voices and much trampling of feet. When he
entered, he found himself added to a confused and astonished group, which, assembled in that
apartment, stood gazing upon each other. At the upper end of the room stood the Queen, equipped
as for a journey, and--attended not only by the Lady Fleming, but by the omnipresent Catherine
Seyton, dressed in the habit of her own sex, and bearing in her hand the casket in which Mary
kept such jewels as she had been permitted to retain. At the other end of the hall was the
Lady of Lochleven, hastily dressed, as one startled from slumber by the sudden alarm, and surrounded
by domestics, some bearing torches, others holding naked swords, partisans, pistols, or such
other weapons as they had caught up in the hurry of a night alarm. Betwixt these two parties
stood George of Douglas, his arms folded on his breast, his eyes bent on the ground, like a
criminal who knows not how to deny, yet continues unwilling to avow, the guilt in which he
has been detected.

"Madam," said old Dryfesdale the steward, "this much do I say for this silly page, that he
could not be accessary to unlocking the doors, since I myself this night bolted him out of
the castle. Whoever limned this night-piece, the lad's share in it seems to have been small."

"Thou liest, Dryfesdale," said the Lady, "and wouldst throw the blame on thy master's house,
to save the worthless life of a gipsy boy."

"His death were more desirable to me than his life," answered the steward, sullenly; "but the
truth is the truth."

At these words Douglas raised his head, drew up his figure to its full height, and spoke boldly
and sedately, as one whose resolution was taken.  "Let no life be endangered for me. I alone----"

"Douglas," said the Queen, interrupting him, "art thou mad? Speak not, I charge you."
