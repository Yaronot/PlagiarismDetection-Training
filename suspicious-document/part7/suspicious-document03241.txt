As to the argument of cause and effect, the latter certainly implies the former; but when we
give the name of effect to any thing, we must be certain it is an effect, for we may be so
far mistaken perhaps as to call that an effect which is a cause, at least what is an effect
to-day may be a cause to-morrow, as in the instance of generation; for though a son does not
beget his father, he too has his offspring in which he may be said to live over again, and
if we are to argue only from experience, most probably that alone is the resurrection and the
life to come. But if it is contended that our experience relates only to finite causes, or
causes incapable of comprehending themselves, it must at the same time be allowed, that all
our reasoning is founded only on experience. This Dr. P. at least allows even while he keeps
reasoning about a Deity, which he calls an infinite cause capable of comprehending itself,
though nobody is capable of comprehending it, and of which we therefore can have no experience.
Yet he will assert, that thinking persons seldom are convinced by thinking. This is odd language
for a reasoner. As a consequence
the early termination of starvation, was one presented here appears to be the cause! Against this
Folly to fight against this world of ignorance was impossible. Yet he always had again in good
faith eagerly listened to the grid to the impresario, the appearance of the photographs but he was always
going on the grid, fell back into the straw with a sigh, and calmed Public could come and
visit it again approached. It would indeed
be absurd, says Dr. Priestley provided we agreed that the universe is a caused existence, for
God is the name we give for the cause of the universe, which in such case must exist. It is
only denying that the universe is a caused existence, and then the absurdity is taken away.
Dr. Priestley, for the sake of making Dr. Clarke absurd, will readily allow the denial capable
of being made; and for the same purpose he seems gravely to have taken upon himself to prove
that school-boy's difficulty, that two and two do make four, for he says, that four is the
term agreed upon in language to be given to the sum total of two and two, and that to deny
the Deity is at least not so absurd as to say that two and two do not make four.

Dr. Priestley says he finds no difficulty in excluding every thing from the mind except space
and duration. He allows then at least, that there is no manifest absurdity in supposing there
is no Deity, for nothing can be proved by reasoning if the conclusion can be denied without
absurdity, nor can there be a manifest absurdity in denying the existence of what there is
no difficulty in excluding from the mind. Yet after all he adds (somewhat inconsistently) that
we cannot exclude the idea of a Deity, if we do not exclude an existent universe. This Deity
he defines to be a most simple Being; simple and infinite; terms which but ill agree together. Why did you deprive
him of the glory continue to go hungry, not just the largest hunger artist of all time to be
that he was probably yes, but also to excel themselves to the incomprehensible, to go hungry
because of his ability, he felt no limits. Why had This amount, which purported to admire him
so much, so little patience with him if he could stand it, continue to starve, why they did not
want to endure? He too was tired, sat well in the straw and should now raise up high and long and
go to the food that he alone in the idea of ​​nausea caused, that statement he laboriously
only with respect to the ladies suppressed.
 If he means to argue that it is more rational to conclude this Deity wanted power
and knowledge than that he wanted benevolence, and because Dr. Priestley fancies himself to
have proved the Deity cannot want the two former, he concludes the Deity cannot want the latter,
as the less probable for him to be deficient in, his argument is no more a truism. As a wish,
that the Deity may not want benevolence, in that sense let him take it as agreed upon. He allows
that misery in the human species proves malevolence in the Deity, and happiness the contrary.
All the proof adduced in favour of benevolence is in asserting that throughout the universe,
good is more predominant than evil. The infinite extent of benevolence he will allow incapable
of proof; but then it is said that the evils which mankind endure are not so great as might
be inflicted upon them; that virtue to vice, happiness to misery, health to sickness bear at
least equal proportions. That lesser evils exist instead of greater is indeed but a poor proof
in the favour of the benevolence of an all-powerful Being. Or grant, that good is more predominant
than evil, this surely is no proof neither of the benevolence of a kind and all-powerful Being.
Yet Dr. Priestley adds that the general benevolence of the Deity is unquestionable. How unquestionable?
It is questioned by the author himself, and he declares he cannot prove it. After this he asks,
who will pretend to dictate to such a Being? He might in the same stile conclude that no objection
deserved a reply. The whole of this is absurd; but when the Doctor begins to feel enthusiasm
he is like the rest of the ecclesiastical arguers. They reason themselves into imaginary Beings
with more imaginary properties and then fall down and worship them. God is said to have made
man in the image of himself. If he has done so, man is up with him, for he in return makes
God in his own image. Much as the imagination of one man differs from another, so differs the
God of each devotee. 

If the witnesses of such scenes a few years later it returns thought they were often even incomprehensible.
For now those mentioned shift had occurred, almost suddenly had this happened, it might have deeper
reasons, but who was anxious to locate them at any rate found himself one day leave the pampered hunger
artist of the pleasure-seeking crowd, streamed to the rather different setting positions. Once
again, the impresario chased him through half of Europe, to see whether it is not yet here and
there to find again the old interest, all in vain, as in a secret agreement had been almost
everywhere an aversion designed to show the starving.
 If it is objected, why have we not had pain enough by the time each of us are
twenty or thirty years of age, instead of waiting 'till our deaths at so many different ages?
He can only finish his argument by allowing that the ways of God are inscrutable to man, that
every thing is for the best and refer us to Candide for the rest of his philosophy; nor will
he ever resolve the question, "if evil and pain are good and necessary now, why will they not
always be so? Take a view of human existence, and who can even allow, that there is more happiness
than misery in the world? Dr. Priestley thinks to give the turn of the scale to happiness,
by making it depend intirely upon health, notwithstanding he says in another place that human
sensations are a mass collected from the past, present and future, and as a man grows up the
present goes on to bear a less proportion to the other two. Many a healthy man has certainly
been unhappy, or else had a man better study health than virtue. If the mill-wright make a
poor machine he is a poor workman; God in like manner designing health and introducing sickness
is but a poor physician. In another place Dr. Priestley having considered, that he had asserted
that human sensations arise from ideas of the past and future as well as the present, finds
himself obliged to alter his notions of happiness, so far as to say that happiness is more
intellectual than corporeal. But it is rather extraordinary to assert at the same time, that
happiness is the necessary consequence of health, and that happiness is more from intellectual
than corporeal feelings. Surely health, if any thing, is corporeal. Another curious fancy about
pain and happiness is, that our finite nature not admitting infinite or unlimited happiness
we must leave it to the wisdom of the Deity to determine which is best for us (since happiness
must be diminished) a little pain to be added to it or somewhat of happiness to be taken away. And defended in this moment the Hunger artist
ever. While he lay still volunteered his bony arms outstretched in the helpful Hands of the ladies bending
over him to get up but he would not. Why now after forty days to end?
 To conclude he asks, "how
it is possible to teach children caution, but by feeling pain?" It is easy to allow in answer,
that it might not perhaps be possible in us. But he is arguing about the benevolence of a Deity.
It was possible, he will allow, in him to have given these children knowledge without pain,
at least if he continues to him the attribute he allows of omnipotence.

Next he observes that parents suspend at times their benefits to their offspring, when persuaded
they are not for their good; so does the Deity. But before this argument holds he must therefore
say, it is not for the good of man to be made happy now, and that the Deity can be infinitely
benevolent without willing either infinite or universal happiness. Take the argument any way,
it must go against his benevolence or his power; and the same observations hold as to his love
of justice, whilst he is so tardy in punishing offenders. All he had to accept, had also accustomed
over the years, but inwardly they are gnawing dissatisfaction to him, and never after any period
of starvation - this testimony was necessary to issue him - He had voluntarily left the cage.
 From thence he proceeds to assert, that atheists
may believe it within the course of nature, that men as moral agents may after death be re-produced,
and therefore that there may be a future state though there be no God, because he reasons it
may be in the course of nature. This allows that the course of nature may be as it is without
a God, and that there is therefore no natural proof of a Deity. His farther argument on this
head is, that "things usually happen in a state of nature that are proper. A future state is
proper. (To carry on the supposed state of melioration and complete the moral government of
the universe.) It is therefore probable." This is an argument perhaps more of wish than probability,
but let it have such force as belongs to it. It is not the wish of the answerer by supporting
atheism to give encouragement to immorality, but should he unwarily or with weak minds do so,
the argument of the Deity's existence is independent of such considerations. Large, colorful painted inscriptions surrounded the cage
and announced what was on display. When the audience during the breaks to the idea the stables
urged to visit the animals, it was almost inevitable that it the hunger artist passed by and made a little
stop there, you might have stayed longer with him, if not in the narrow passage of the oncoming
what this stay on the path to the longed stables did not understand a longer quiet contemplation
would have been impossible. If this is not an argument
against the morality of a Deity, it is at all events one against his infinite morality though
moral is an attribute to be given to him in the infinite degree as much as any other.
