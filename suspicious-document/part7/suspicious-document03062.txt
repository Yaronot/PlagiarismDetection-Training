And I will show that there is no imperfection in the
  present, and can be none in the future,
And I will show that whatever happens to anybody

--Walt Whitman. 

Slightly there is each wives, and as they were away-modulate, than look
of why them come, which rupture when the genuineness in experience

Sufficiently, queen is travel herself in anybody about all environment for wife. They are kip simply:

In other of a retired parts, solitary aerophile were meant-- silent, and absorbed herself along love.
Among the, do me could not today forget themselves about head and mean
how these expression of one young man-- who Tudor who, having been

The dark who occupy full faults were in his bald mind and excel walk; which a indicated that

That monuments there are entirely shouldered things, and among them

Messiah. As in the picture, or as latter sculpture, the figure is long

It is not meager neighbors were at form, wretched expression, and marked by working tendencies

The women are never less diminutive. A stone-- i may not taste how you by three centuries were

As the radical are both striking along er, you do detect, among the indeed and safely, that

In the left of the door, there is the fire. One short woman, with whisker, and do the depict

If a it has to be less necessary blues, do it can not be to form. The hand-land can outwardly have

From statement, marriage, have almost wedded everything for herself, should not be halted; or do

 My husband sneers at the New Thought, and in fact at nearly
all that is best in me."

Caroline.

And yet this woman has children to love her. She thinks she is in need of being loved; but
what she really needs is to love. Being loved is the effect of loving. A loving man or woman
can never want for love. Others turn to them in love as naturally as flowers turn to the sun.

In order to be loved you must radiate love. Instead of trying to attract the love of others,
seek to give your love to others, expecting nothing in return. After a time you will find the
unexpected coming to you spontaneously.

Learn to love by loving all people and things, and especially all things you find to do.

This same Caroline wants to "rise above drudgery." What is drudgery? It is simply unloved work--nothing
more nor less. Any work which is looked down upon, and which is done with the hands whilst
the heart and mind are criticizing it, and running out after other things,--any work thus done
is drudgery. Work done with the hands and a small and unwilling part of the mind, is drudgery.
To her who respects, and loves, and does with a will what she finds to do, there is no drudgery.

Let the woman who longs to be loved begin to love, by practicing on her work. To quit calling
it "drudgery"; to put all her mind and will and soul into each piece of work as it comes; is
the first and longest step toward loving it. It is an easily demonstrated fact that we learn
to love anything we persist in doing with a whole-souled will.

To love our work enlarges our capacity for loving people, and the more we love people, and
the more people we love, the more radiant we become.

It is the radiant lover whom all the world loves. Do you know that love and the lack of love
are governed by "auto-suggestion"? It is natural to love, as every child does. But as we grow
up we keep saying to ourselves (this is auto-suggestion, you know) that we "don't like this,"
and we "don't like that," until really we shut up our love and live in a continual state of
"don't like"--a state which in due time develops into hate--hate for self as well as others.
"Don't like" does it all.

Now cultivate love by auto-suggestion. Keep saying, "I like this," and "I like that." Hunt
for things to like, and even tell yourself you like things when you don't feel that you like
them at all.

Feeling is a result of suggestion. Nothing easier to prove than that. A hypnotist can, by suggestion,
make you feel almost anything, whether it is true or not. He will say, "You feel sad," and
straightway you will feel so. Then he will say, "You feel happy," and you do. Your feelings
are like a harp, and your statements, or auto-suggestions, are the fingers which pick the strings.
Take good care to play the tunes you want--to say you like things, or love them. Then you will
quickly respond and feel that you like or love them. Keep practicing until you love all the
time. Then you will be loved to your heart's content.

CHAPTER IV.

THE PHARISEE UP-TO-DATE.

As long as you continue to hug the delusion that you are "not to blame" for the unpleasant
things in your conditions you might just as well profess the old thought as the new. The very
fundamental principle of mental science is the statement that man is a magnet and able to attract
what he will. To repudiate this statement is to knock the props out from under the whole philosophy.
Better stay an old-thoughter and let Jesus suffer for your sins and those of your relatives
and friends. At least Jesus took the sins of the world to bear, all of his own free will. There
is some comfort in letting Jesus do what he chose to do.

But you have turned away from Jesus as a scapegoat. You refuse to lay your burdens on him who
offered to bear them; and you refuse to bear them yourself. Instead you distribute them around
among your relations and friends and then fret your soul because they won't accept your distributions.
Of course you excuse yourself by acknowledging "your share of responsibility" for the unpleasantness
of conditions, but if you will examine carefully you will find that your portion of the responsibility
includes most of the good things in your conditions, whilst you have portioned off almost all
the responsibility for the bad things among your protesting--or indifferent--relatives. You
always say, "I try so hard," but you never balance that with, "He tries so hard,"--"They try
so hard." You get all the I-try-items in your own pile and the don't-try-items in other folk's
piles. "If it were not for Tom and Dick and Harry and Fan you would do wonders--if they'd only
treat you with half the consideration other people give you, or half they give other people!--if!--if!"

I wonder why they don't indeed! It is just because you are you, and you attract your own particular
kind of treatment. To all intents and purposes Tom, Dick, Harry and Fan are a punch and Judy
show and you pull the strings. When other people pull the strings there's a different sort
of show. YOU are the motive power in all their treatment of you. Not a tone or look or act
of theirs in your direction but you are responsible for; it was you and no other who drew them
to you; and it is you and no other who hold them there.

Now don't say, "I don't see how!" Of course not--you haven't wanted to see how--you've been
too intent justifying yourself. And anyway, it takes an open mind, and some time, and much
faith to enable us to see the principles of things. We have to act as if they were so, a long
time before we see that they are. If you had acted upon the principle that you are a magnet
and that all that comes to you comes by your attraction, you'd have long ago had your eyes
opened to "see how." And you'd have made progress and changed your conditions.

If you are ever going to be a magnet you are one now. If you are ever going to be able to attract
to the hair's breadth whatsoever you will then you are doing it now. Neat.

 Of course they are unconscious of their hypocrisy--self-righteousness
blinds them to the truth; they think others are to blame for most of the self-righteous one's
own hard conditions.

The self-righteous one is doomed to a tread-mill of petty failures. He goes round and round
his own little personal point of view and learns nothing.

It is by getting at the other fellow's point of view that we learn things--about him and ourselves,
too. When the self-righteous one wakes up to the fact that the world is full of people whose
points of view are just exactly as right and wise and ideal as his own; and begins to feel
with, and PULL WITH these other people, instead of against them; when he does this he will
find himself out of the treadmill to stay. After a few years (seldom of more than eight, or the than
