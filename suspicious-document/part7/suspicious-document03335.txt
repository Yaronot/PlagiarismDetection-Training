"Tobacco paralyzes the nerves of sensation, so that feeling is lessened. That is why men like
to use it. They think they feel better, when in reality they feel less, or not at all; and
to have no feeling or power to feel is a dangerous condition. Pain, or sensation, is our great
protection, and to remove sensation by paralysis is to render ourselves open to danger. This
paralytic condition may become an inheritance. Many children have infantile paralysis because
their fathers are users of tobacco."

"I am glad my father doesn't use it," exclaimed Helen with emphasis.

"Indeed, you may well be glad, and you can see to it that your children have the same cause
for rejoicing. The girls of to-day have a wonderful influence on all time, the present and
the future. I wish they knew how to use it wisely."

"But girls think it is manly to smoke. I've heard lots of them say so. Stella Wilson says she
wouldn't marry a man that didn't smoke; and Kate Barrows said the other day that she thought
girls had no right to interfere with the enjoyment of men by asking them to give up smoking.
She said she knew how nice it was, for she had tried it; and she said the most fashionable
women smoke, and she means to smoke when she has a home of her own."

"All of which only proves that she is a poor, ignorant girl who does not know her own value
to herself, or to the world. She may yet have cause to weep over children made weak and nervous,
or who have died because of her ignorance."

"Isn't it sad that ignorance does not save us from punishment?"

"Yes, but it does not. If you can't swim, you may drown, even while trying to save another.
God's laws cannot vary to save us from the penalty of ignorance.

"I wonder now, dear, if you are not beginning to see the greatness of woman's work. In her
own vigor she creates health for the future of the nation. So you see whether you wear your
overshoes or not, may be a question of importance to the race. By her virtue, courage, patience,
purity, she is storing up those qualities for the men and women of the future. By her demanding
of her future husband that he shall be without fear and without reproach, as clean in life
and thought as herself, she is building up protections around the children of generations to
come. Even the young girls of to-day are creating national conditions for the future, are deciding
the destiny of the nation,--yes, of the race. The great structures that men build will in time
perish, but character is eternal. Is it not even a greater thing to be a woman than to be a man?"

"I begin to think so, and I think after this I'll try to feel that even I am of importance
to the world, instead of regretting that I am not a man."

AMERICAN MOTHERHOOD

is a magazine for mothers, edited by mothers. It is a magazine with a purpose and that is to
give mothers practical help in the solution of the problems they meet each day. Nor is the
magazine lacking in interest to others besides mothers. Fathers find it worthy of their attention;
teachers find it full of helpful suggestions; workers in Mothers' Clubs and similar organizations
could hardly get along without it; even the children look for it eagerly because of the things
that can be read aloud to them.

Young mothers with babies in their arms are not the only ones who need help and advice; older
mothers whose children are in the kindergarten, the grade school or the high school, feel their
responsibility weighing on them with even greater force.

SPECIAL FEATURES

The problem of the boy is one of the greatest parents and teachers have to deal with, therefore
it receives especial attention in American Motherhood. It is surprising to learn how many fathers
read this publication closely. The adolescent period is to many the most trying and puzzling
period in their children's lives. In this magazine they find that which enables than to understand
the boys and girls who are passing through this time of storm and stress; so they are enabled
to deal wisely with them, guiding than safely into a strong, noble maturity. The heart of the
magazine is the Parents' Problems department. Here is answered by the editor, and by a woman
physician of splendid training and long experience, the questions submitted by the readers.

How to wean the baby; what kind of clothes to dress him in; what food the prospective mother
should eat; how to teach children to be truthful; how to break a child of whining; how to keep
the active boy from wrong-doing; how to overcome timidity; how to secure obedience; what to
do with the boy who wants to smoke; these and hundreds of other questions are answered with
great care and thought. Some of the best known educators of the day are contributors to the
magazine. The articles are simple, practical and to the point, while the great aim of the magazine
is to be helpful.
