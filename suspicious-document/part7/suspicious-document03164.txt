CHAPTER III.

CONFERENCES.

The next day Sir Miles did not appear at breakfast,--not that he was unwell, but that he meditated
holding certain audiences, and on such occasions the good old gentleman liked to prepare himself.
He belonged to a school in which, amidst much that was hearty and convivial, there was much
also that nowadays would seem stiff and formal, contrasting the other school immediately succeeding
him, which Mr. Vernon represented, and of which the Charles Surface of Sheridan is a faithful
and admirable type.  The room that Sir Miles appropriated to himself was, properly speaking,
the state apartment, called, in the old inventories, "King James's chamber;" it was on the
first floor, communicating with the picture-gallery, which at the farther end opened upon a
corridor admitting to the principal bedrooms.  As Sir Miles cared nothing for holiday state,
he had unscrupulously taken his cubiculum in this chamber, which was really the handsomest
in the house, except the banquet-hall, placed his bed in one angle with a huge screen before
it, filled up the space with his Italian antiquities and curiosities; and fixed his favourite
pictures on the faded gilt leather panelled on the walls.  His main motive in this was the
communication with the adjoining gallery, which, when the weather was unfavourable, furnished
ample room for his habitual walk.  He knew how many strides by the help of his crutch made
a mile, and this was convenient.  Moreover, he liked to look, when alone, on those old portraits
of his ancestors, which he had religiously conserved in their places, preferring to thrust
his Florentine and Venetian masterpieces into bedrooms and parlours, rather than to dislodge
from the gallery the stiff ruffs, doublets, and farthingales of his predecessors.  It was whispered
in the house that the baronet, whenever he had to reprove a tenant or lecture a dependant,
took care to have him brought to his sanctum, through the full length of this gallery, so that
the victim might be duly prepared and awed by the imposing effect of so stately a journey,
and the grave faces of all the generations of St. John, which could not fail to impress him
with the dignity of the family, and alarm him at the prospect of the injured frown of its representative.
Across this gallery now, following the steps of the powdered valet, strode young Ardworth,
staring now and then at some portrait more than usually grim, more often wondering why his
boots, that never creaked before, should creak on those particular boards, and feeling a quiet
curiosity, without the least mixture of fear or awe as to what old Squaretoes intended to say
to him.  But all feeling of irreverence ceased when, shown into the baronet's room, and the
door closed, Sir Miles rose with a smile, and cordially shaking his hand, said, dropping the
punctilious courtesy of Mister: "Ardworth, sir, if I had a little prejudice against you before
you came, you have conquered it.  You are a fine, manly, spirited fellow, sir; and you have
an old man's good wishes,--which are no bad beginning to a young man's good fortune."

The colour rushed over Ardworth's forehead, and a tear sprang to his eyes.  He felt a rising
at his throat as he stammered out some not very audible reply.

"I wished to see you, young gentleman, that I might judge myself what you would like best,
and what would best fit you.  Your father is in the army: what say you to a pair of colours?"

"Oh, Sir Miles, that is my utmost ambition!  Anything but law, except the Church; anything
but the Church, except the desk and a counter!"

The baronet, much pleased, gave him a gentle pat on the shoulder.  "Ha, ha! we gentlemen, you
see (for the Ardworths are very well born, very), we gentlemen understand each other!  Between
you and me, I never liked the law, never thought a man of birth should belong to it.  Take
money for lying,--shabby, shocking!  Don't let that go any farther!  The Church-Mother Church--I
honour her!  Church and State go together!  But one ought to be very good to preach to others,--better
than you and I are, eh? ha, ha!  Well, then, you like the army,--there's a letter for you to
the Horse Guards.  Go up to town; your business is done.  And, as for your outfit,--read this
little book at your leisure."  And Sir Miles thrust a pocketbook into Ardworth's hand.

"But pardon me," said the young man, much bewildered.  "What claim have I, Sir Miles, to such
generosity?  I know that my uncle offended you."

"Sir, that's the claim!" said Sir Miles, gravely.  "I cannot live long," he added, with a touch
of melancholy in his voice; "let me die in peace with all!  Perhaps I injured your uncle,--who
knows but, if so, he hears and pardons me now?"

"Oh, Sir Miles!" exclaimed the thoughtless, generous-hearted young man; "and my little playfellow,
Susan, your own niece!"

Sir Miles drew back haughtily; but the burst that offended him rose so evidently from the heart,
was so excusable from its motive and the youth's ignorance of the world, that his frown soon
vanished as he said, calmly and gravely,--

"No man, my good sir, can allow to others the right to touch on his family affairs; I trust
I shall be just to the poor young lady.  And so, if we never meet again, let us think well
of each other.  Go, my boy; serve your king and your country!"

"I will do my best, Sir Miles, if only to merit your kindness."

"Stay a moment: you are intimate, I find, with young Mainwaring?"

"An old college friendship, Sir Miles."

"The army will not do for him, eh?"

"He is too clever for it, sir."

"Ah, he'd make a lawyer, I suppose,--glib tongue enough, and can talk well; and lie, if he's
paid for it?"

"I don't know how lawyers regard those matters, Sir Miles; but if you don't make him a lawyer,
I am sure you must leave him an honest man."

"Really and truly--"

"Upon my honour I think so."

"Good-day to you, and good luck.  You must catch the coach at the lodge; for I see by the papers
that, in spite of all the talk about peace, they are raising regiments like wildfire."

With very different feelings from those with which he had entered the room, Ardworth quitted
it.  He hurried into his own chamber to thrust his clothes into his portmanteau, and while
thus employed, Mainwaring entered.

"Joy, my dear fellow, wish me joy!  I am going to town,--into the army; abroad; to be shot
at, thank Heaven!  That dear old gentleman!  Just throw me that coat, will you?"

A very few more words sufficed to explain what had passed to Mainwaring. He sighed when his
friend had finished: "I wish I were going with you!"

"Do you?  Sir Miles has only got to write another letter to the Horse Guards.  But no, you
are meant to be something better than food for powder; and, besides, your Lucretia!  Hang it,
I am sorry I cannot stay to examine her as I had promised; but I have seen enough to know that
she certainly loves you.  Ah, when she changed flowers with you, you did not think I saw you,--sly,
was not I?  Pshaw! She was only playing with Vernon.  But still, do you know, Will, now that
Sir Miles has spoken to me so, that I could have sobbed, 'God bless you, my old boy!' 'pon
my life, I could!  Now, do you know that I feel enraged with you for abetting that girl to
deceive him?"

"I am enraged with myself; and--"

Here a servant entered, and informed Mainwaring that he had been searching for him; Sir Miles
requested to see him in his room. Mainwaring started like a culprit.

"Never fear," whispered Ardworth; "he has no suspicion of you, I'm sure. Shake hands.  When
shall we meet again?  Is it not odd, I, who am a republican by theory, taking King George's
pay to fight against the French?  No use stopping now to moralize on such contradictions. 
John, Tom,--what's your name?--here, my man, here, throw that portmanteau on your shoulder
and come to the lodge."  And so, full of health, hope, vivacity, and spirit, John Walter Ardworth
departed on his career.

Meanwhile Mainwaring slowly took his way to Sir Miles.  As he approached the gallery, he met
Lucretia, who was coming from her own room.  "Sir Miles has sent for me," he said meaningly.
He had time for no more, for the valet was at the door of the gallery, waiting to usher him
to his host. "Ha! you will say not a word that can betray us; guard your looks too!" whispered
Lucretia, hurriedly; "afterwards, join me by the cedars." She passed on towards the staircase,
and glanced at the large clock that was placed there.  "Past eleven!  Vernon is never up before
twelve.  I must see him before my uncle sends for me, as he will send if he suspects--"  She
paused, went back to her room, rang for her maid, dressed as for walking, and said carelessly,
"If Sir Miles wants me, I am gone to the rectory, and shall probably return by the village,
so that I shall be back about one."  Towards the rectory, indeed, Lucretia bent her way; but
half-way there, turned back, and passing through the plantation at the rear of the house, awaited
Mainwaring on the bench beneath the cedars.  He was not long before he joined her.  His face
was sad and thoughtful; and when he seated himself by her side, it was with a weariness of
spirit that alarmed her.

"Well," said she, fearfully, and she placed her hand on his.

"Oh, Lucretia," he exclaimed, as he pressed that hand with an emotion that came from other
passions than love, "we, or rather I, have done great wrong.  I have been leading you to betray
your uncle's trust, to convert your gratitude to him into hypocrisy.  I have been unworthy
of myself.  I am poor, I am humbly born, but till I came here, I was rich and proud in honour.
I am not so now.  Lucretia, pardon me, pardon me! Let the dream be over; we must not sin thus;
for it is sin, and the worst of sin,--treachery.  We must part: forget me!"

"Forget you!  Never, never, never!" cried Lucretia, with suppressed but most earnest vehemence,
her breast heaving, her hands, as he dropped the one he held, clasped together, her eyes full
of tears,--transformed at once into softness, meekness, even while racked by passion and despair.

"Oh, William, say anything,--reproach, chide, despise me, for mine is all the fault; say anything
but that word 'part.'  I have chosen you, I have sought you out, I have wooed you, if you will;
be it so.  I cling to you, you are my all,--all that saves me from--from myself," she added
falteringly, and in a hollow voice.  "Your love--you know not what it is to me!  I scarcely
knew it myself before.  I feel what it is now, when you say 'part.'"

Agitated and tortured, Mainwaring writhed at these burning words, bent his face low, and covered
it with his hands.

He felt her clasp struggling to withdraw them, yielded, and saw her kneeling at his feet. 
His manhood and his gratitude and his heart all moved by that sight in one so haughty, he opened
his arms, and she fell on his breast. "You will never say 'part' again, William!" she gasped
convulsively.

"But what are we to do?"

"Say, first, what has passed between you and my uncle."

"Little to relate; for I can repeat words, not tones and looks.  Sir Miles spoke to me, at
first kindly and encouragingly, about my prospects, said it was time that I should fix myself,
added a few words, with menacing emphasis, against what he called 'idle dreams and desultory
ambition,' and observing that I changed countenance,--for I felt that I did,--his manner became
more cold and severe.  Lucretia, if he has not detected our secret, he more than suspects my--my
presumption.  Finally, he said dryly, that I had better return home, consult with my father,
and that if I preferred entering into the service of the Government to any mercantile profession,
he thought he had sufficient interest to promote my views.  But, clearly and distinctly, he
left on my mind one impression,--that my visits here are over."

"Did he allude to me--to Mr. Vernon?"

"Ah, Lucretia! do you know him so little,--his delicacy, his pride?"

Lucretia was silent, and Mainwaring continued:--

"I felt that I was dismissed.  I took my leave of your uncle; I came hither with the intention
to say farewell forever."

"Hush! hush! that thought is over.  And you return to your father's,-- perhaps better so: it
is but hope deferred; and in your absence I can the more easily allay all suspicion, if suspicion
exist. But I must write to you; we must correspond.  William, dear William, write often,--write
kindly; tell me, in every letter, that you love me,--that you love only me; that you will be
patient, and confide."

"Dear Lucretia," said Mainwaring, tenderly, and moved by the pathos of her earnest and imploring
voice, "but you forget: the bag is always brought first to Sir Miles; he will recognize my
hand.  And to whom can you trust your own letters?"

"True," replied Lucretia, despondingly; and there was a pause.  Suddenly she lifted her head,
and cried: "But your father's house is not far from this,--not ten miles; we can find a spot
at the remote end of the park, near the path through the great wood: there I can leave my letters;
there I can find yours."

"But it must be seldom.  If any of Sir Miles's servants see me, if--"

"Oh, William, William, this is not the language of love!"

"Forgive me,--I think of you!" 

"it would i, beloved. Velleity which must be the manner, it can be trustworthy really; and falsity,

  The season of
London was over, but there was always a set, and that set the one in which Charley Vernon principally
moved, who found town fuller than the country. Besides, he went occasionally to Brighton, which
was then to England what Baiae was to Rome.  The prince was holding gay court at the Pavilion,
and that was the atmosphere which Vernon was habituated to breathe.  He was no parasite of
royalty; he had that strong personal affection to the prince which it is often the good fortune
of royalty to attract.  Nothing is less founded than the complaint which poets put into the
lips of princes, that they have no friends,--it is, at least, their own perverse fault if that
be the case; a little amiability, a little of frank kindness, goes so far when it emanates
from the rays of a crown.  But Vernon was stronger than Lucretia deemed him; once contemplating
the prospect of a union which was to consign to his charge the happiness of another, and feeling
all that he should owe in such a marriage to the confidence both of niece and uncle, he evinced
steadier principles than he had ever made manifest when he had only his own fortune to mar,
and his own happiness to trifle with.  He joined his old companions, but he kept aloof from
their more dissipated pursuits.  Beyond what was then thought the venial error of too devout
libations to Bacchus, Charley Vernon seemed reformed.

Ardworth had joined a regiment which had departed for the field of action.  Mainwaring was
still with his father, and had not yet announced to Sir Miles any wish or project for the future.

Olivier Dalibard, as before, passed his mornings alone in his chamber,-- his noons and his
evenings with Sir Miles.  He avoided all private conferences with Lucretia.  She did not provoke
them.  Young Gabriel amused himself in copying Sir Miles's pictures, sketching from Nature,
scribbling in his room prose or verse, no matter which (he never showed his lucubrations),
pinching the dogs when he could catch them alone, shooting the cats, if they appeared in the
plantation, on pretence of love for the young pheasants, sauntering into the cottages, where
he was a favourite because of his good looks, but where he always contrived to leave the trace
of his visits in disorder and mischief, upsetting the tea-kettle and scalding the children,
or, what he loved dearly, setting two gossips by the ears.  But these occupations were over
by the hour Lucretia left her apartment.  From that time he never left her out of view; and
when encouraged to join her at his usual privileged times, whether in the gardens at sunset
or in her evening niche in the drawing- room, he was sleek, silken, and caressing as Cupid,
after plaguing the Nymphs, at the feet of Psyche.  These two strange persons had indeed apparently
that sort of sentimental familiarity which is sometimes seen between a fair boy and a girl
much older than himself; but the attraction that drew them together was an indefinable instinct
of their similarity in many traits of their several characters,--the whelp leopard sported
fearlessly around the she-panther.  Before Olivier's midnight conference with his son, Gabriel
had drawn close and closer to Lucretia, as an ally against his father; for that father he cherished
feelings which, beneath the most docile obedience, concealed horror and hate, and something
of the ferocity of revenge.  And if young Varney loved any one on earth except himself, it
was Lucretia Clavering.  She had administered to his ruling passions, which were for effect
and display; she had devised the dress which set off to the utmost his exterior, and gave it
that picturesque and artistic appearance which he had sighed for in his study of the portraits
of Titian and Vandyke.  She supplied him (for in money she was generous) with enough to gratify
and forestall every boyish caprice; and this liberality now turned against her, for it had
increased into a settled vice his natural taste for extravagance, and made all other considerations
subordinate to that of feeding his cupidity.  She praised his drawings, which, though self-taught,
were indeed extraordinary, predicted his fame as an artist, lifted him into consequence amongst
the guests by her notice and eulogies, and what, perhaps, won him more than all, he felt that
it was to her--to Dalibard's desire to conceal before her his more cruel propensities--that
he owed his father's change from the most refined severity to the most paternal gentleness.

And thus he had repaid her, as she expected, by a devotion which she trusted to employ against
her tutor himself, should the baffled aspirant become the scheming rival and the secret foe.
But now,--thoroughly aware of the gravity of his father's objects, seeing before him the chance
of a settled establishment at Laughton, a positive and influential connection with Lucretia;
and on the other hand a return to the poverty he recalled with disgust, and the terrors of
his father's solitary malice and revenge,--he entered fully into Dalibard's sombre plans, and
without scruple or remorse, would have abetted any harm to his benefactress. Thus craft, doomed
to have accomplices in craft, resembles the spider, whose web, spread indeed for the fly, attracts
the fellow-spider that shall thrust it forth, and profit by the meshes it has woven for a victim,
to surrender to a master.

Already young Varney, set quietly and ceaselessly to spy every movement of Lucretia's, had
reported to his father two visits to the most retired part of the park; but he had not yet
ventured near enough to discover the exact spot, and his very watch on Lucretia had prevented
the detection of Mainwaring himself in his stealthy exchange of correspondence.  Dalibard bade
him continue his watch, without hinting at his ulterior intentions, for, indeed, in these he
was not decided.  Even should he discover any communication between Lucretia and Mainwaring,
how reveal it to Sir Miles without forever precluding himself from the chance of profiting
by the betrayal?  Could Lucretia ever forgive the injury, and could she fail to detect the
hand that inflicted it?  His only hope was in the removal of Mainwaring from his path by other
agencies than his own, and (by an appearance of generosity and self-abandonment, in keeping
her secret and submitting to his fate) he trusted to regain the confidence she now withheld
from him, and use it to his advantage when the time came to defend himself from Vernon.  For
he had learned from Sir Miles the passive understanding with respect to that candidate for
her hand; and he felt assured that had Mainwaring never existed, could he cease to exist for
her hopes, Lucretia, despite her dissimulation, would succumb to one she feared but respected,
rather than one she evidently trifled with and despised.

"But the course to be taken must be adopted after the evidence is collected," thought the subtle
schemer, and he tranquilly continued his chess with the baronet.

Before, however, Gabriel could make any further discoveries, an event occurred which excited
very different emotions amongst those it more immediately interested.

Sir Miles had, during the last twelve months, been visited by two seizures, seemingly of an
apoplectic character.  Whether they were apoplexy, or the less alarming attacks that arise
from some more gentle congestion, occasioned by free living and indolent habits, was matter
of doubt with his physician,--not a very skilful, though a very formal, man. Country doctors
were not then the same able, educated, and scientific class that they are now rapidly becoming.
Sir Miles himself so stoutly and so eagerly repudiated the least hint of the more unfavourable
interpretation that the doctor, if not convinced by his patient, was awed from expressing plainly
a contrary opinion.  There are certain persons who will dismiss their physician if he tells
them the truth: Sir Miles was one of them.

In his character there was a weakness not uncommon to the proud.  He did not fear death, but
he shrank from the thought that others should calculate on his dying.  He was fond of his power,
though he exercised it gently: he knew that the power of wealth and station is enfeebled in
proportion as its dependants can foresee the date of its transfer.  He dreaded, too, the comments
which are always made on those visited by his peculiar disease: "Poor Sir Miles! an apoplectic
fit.  His intellect must be very much shaken; he revoked at whist last night,--memory sadly
impaired!"  This may be a pitiable foible; but heroes and statesmen have had it most: pardon
it in the proud old man!  He enjoined the physician to state throughout the house and the neighbourhood
that the attacks were wholly innocent and unimportant.  The physician did so, and was generally
believed; for Sir Miles seemed as lively and as vigorous after them as before.  Two persons
alone were not deceived,--Dalibard and Lucretia. The first, at an earlier part of his life,
had studied pathology with the profound research and ingenious application which he brought
to bear upon all he undertook.  He whispered from the first to Lucretia,--

"Unless your uncle changes his habits, takes exercise, and forbears wine and the table, his
days are numbered."

And when this intelligence was first conveyed to her, before she had become acquainted with
Mainwaring, Lucretia felt the shock of a grief sudden and sincere.  We have seen how these
better sentiments changed as human life became an obstacle in her way.  In her character, what
phrenologists call "destructiveness," in the comprehensive sense of the word, was superlatively
developed.  She had not actual cruelty; she was not bloodthirsty: those vices belong to a different
cast of character. She was rather deliberately and intellectually unsparing.  A goal was before
her; she must march to it: all in the way were but hostile impediments.  At first, however,
Sir Miles was not in the way, except to fortune, and for that, as avarice was not her leading
vice, she could well wait; therefore, at this hint of the Provencal's she ventured to urge
her uncle to abstinence and exercise.  But Sir Miles was touchy on the subject; he feared the
interpretations which great change of habits might suggest. The memory of the fearful warning
died away, and he felt as well as before; for, save an old rheumatic gout (which had long since
left him with no other apparent evil but a lameness in the joints that rendered exercise unwelcome
and painful), he possessed one of those comfortable, and often treacherous, constitutions which
evince no displeasure at irregularities, and bear all liberties with philosophical composure.
Accordingly, he would have his own way; and he contrived to coax or to force his doctor into
an authority on his side: wine was necessary to his constitution; much exercise was a dangerous
fatigue. The second attack, following four months after the first, was less alarming, and Sir
Miles fancied it concealed even from his niece; but three nights after his recovery, the old
baronet sat musing alone for some time in his own room before he retired to rest. Then he rose,
opened his desk, and read his will attentively, locked it up with a slight sigh, and took down
his Bible.  The next morning he despatched the letters which summoned Ardworth and Vernon to
his house; and as he quitted his room, his look lingered with melancholy fondness upon the
portraits in the gallery.  No one was by the old man to interpret these slight signs, in which
lay a world of meaning.

A few weeks after Vernon had left the house, and in the midst of the restored tranquillity
we have described, it so happened that Sir Miles's physician, after dining at the Hall, had
been summoned to attend one of the children at the neighbouring rectory; and there he spent
the night. A little before daybreak his slumbers were disturbed; he was recalled in all haste
to Laughton Hall.  For the third time, he found Sir Miles speechless.  Dalibard was by his
bedside.  Lucretia had not been made aware of the seizure; for Sir Miles had previously told
his valet (who of late slept in the same room) never to alarm Miss Clavering if he was taken
ill.  The doctor was about to apply his usual remedies; but when he drew forth his lancet,
Dalibard placed his hand on the physician's arm.

"Not this time," he said slowly, and with emphasis; "it will be his death."

"Pooh, sir!" said the doctor, disdainfully.

"Do so, then; bleed him, and take the responsibility.  I have studied medicine,--I know these
symptoms.  In this case the apoplexy may spare,-- the lancet kills."

The physician drew back dismayed and doubtful.

"What would you do, then?"

"Wait three minutes longer the effect of the cataplasms I have applied. If they fail--"

"Ay, then?"

"A chill bath and vigorous friction."

"Sir, I will never permit it."

"Then murder your patient your own way."

All this while Sir Miles lay senseless, his eyes wide open, his teeth locked.  The doctor drew
near, looked at the lancet, and said irresolutely,--

"Your practice is new to me; but if you have studied medicine, that's another matter.  Will
you guarantee the success of your plan?"

"Yes."

"Mind, I wash my hands of it; I take Mr. Jones to witness;" and he appealed to the valet.

"Call up the footman and lift your master," said Dalibard; and the doctor, glancing round,
saw that a bath, filled some seven or eight inches deep with water, stood already prepared
in the room.  Perplexed and irresolute, he offered no obstacle to Dalibard's movements.  The
body, seemingly lifeless, was placed in the bath; and the servants, under Dalibard's directions,
applied vigorous and incessant friction.  Several minutes elapsed before any favourable symptom
took place.  At length Sir Miles heaved a deep sigh, and the eyes moved; a minute or two more,
and the teeth chattered; the blood, set in motion, appeared on the surface of the skin; life
ebbed back.  The danger was passed, the dark foe driven from the citadel.  Sir Miles spoke
audibly, though incoherently, as he was taken back to his bed, warmly covered up, the lights
removed, noise forbidden, and Dalibard and the doctor remained in silence by the bedside.

"Rich man," thought Dalibard, "thine hour is not yet come; thy wealth must not pass to the
boy Mainwaring."  Sir Miles's recovery, under the care of Dalibard, who now had his own way,
was as rapid and complete as before.  Lucretia when she heard, the next morning, of the attack,
felt, we dare not say a guilty joy, but a terrible and feverish agitation.  Sir Miles himself,
informed by his valet of Dalibard's wrestle with the doctor, felt a profound gratitude and
reverent wonder for the simple means to which he probably owed his restoration; and he listened,
with a docility which Dalibard was not prepared to expect, to his learned secretary's urgent
admonitions as to the life he must lead if he desired to live at all.  Convinced, at last,
that wine and good cheer had not blockaded out the enemy, and having to do, in Olivier Dalibard,
with a very different temper from the doctor's, he assented with a tolerable grace to the trial
of a strict regimen and to daily exercise in the open air.  Dalibard now became constantly
with him; the increase of his influence was as natural as it was apparent.  Lucretia trembled;
she divined a danger in his power, now separate from her own, and which threatened to be independent
of it.  She became abstracted and uneasy; jealousy of the Provencal possessed her.  She began
to meditate schemes for his downfall.  At this time, Sir Miles received the following letter
from Mr. Fielden:--

SOUTHAMPTON, Aug.  20, 1801.

DEAR SIR MILES,--You will remember that I informed you when I arrived at
Southampton with my dear young charge; and Susan has twice written to her
sister, implying the request which she lacked the courage, seeing that
she is timid, expressly to urge, that Miss Clavering might again be
permitted to visit her.  Miss Clavering has answered as might be expected
from the propinquity of the relationship; but she has perhaps the same
fears of offending you that actuate her sister.  But now, since the
worthy clergyman who had undertaken my parochial duties has found the air
insalubrious, and prays me not to enforce the engagement by which we had
exchanged our several charges for the space of a calendar year, I am
reluctantly compelled to return home,--my dear wife, thank Heaven, being
already restored to health, which is an unspeakable mercy; and I am sure
I cannot be sufficiently grateful to Providence, which has not only
provided me with a liberal independence of more than 200 pounds a year,
but the best of wives and the most dutiful of children,--possessions that
I venture to call "the riches of the heart."  Now, I pray you, my dear
Sir Miles, to gratify these two deserving young persons, and to suffer
Miss Lucretia incontinently to visit her sister.  Counting on your
consent, thus boldly demanded, I have already prepared an apartment for
Miss Clavering; and Susan is busy in what, though I do not know much of
such feminine matters, the whole house declares to be a most beautiful
and fanciful toilet-cover, with roses and forget-me-nots cut out of
muslin, and two large silk tassels, which cost her three shillings and
fourpence.  I cannot conclude without thanking you from my heart for your
noble kindness to young Ardworth.  He is so full of ardour and spirit
that I remember, poor lad, when I left him, as I thought, hard at work on
that well-known problem of Euclid vulgarly called the Asses' Bridge,--I
found him describing a figure of 8 on the village pond, which was only
just frozen over!  Poor lad!  Heaven will take care of him, I know, as it
does of all who take no care of themselves.  Ah, Sir Miles, if you could
but see Susan,--such a nurse, too, in illness!  I have the honour to be,
Sir Miles,
              Your most humble, poor servant, to command,
                                              MATTHEW FIELDEN.

Sir Miles put this letter in his niece's hand, and said kindly, "Why not have gone to see your
sister before?  I should not have been angry.  Go, my child, as soon as you like.  To-morrow
is Sunday,--no travelling that day; but the next, the carriage shall be at your order."

Lucretia hesitated a moment.  To leave Dalibard in sole possession of the field, even for a
few days, was a thought of alarm; but what evil could he do in that time?  And her pulse beat
quickly: Mainwaring could come to Southampton; she should see him again, after more than six
weeks' absence!  She had so much to relate and to hear; she fancied his last letter had been
colder and shorter; she yearned to hear him say, with his own lips, that he loved her still.
This idea banished or prevailed over all others.  She thanked her uncle cheerfully and gayly,
and the journey was settled.

"Be at watch early on Monday," said Olivier to his son.

Monday came; the baronet had ordered the carriage to be at the door at ten.  A little before
eight, Lucretia stole out, and took her way to Guy's Oak.  Gabriel had placed himself in readiness;
he had climbed a tree at the bottom of the park (near the place where hitherto he had lost
sight of her); she passed under it,--on through a dark grove of pollard oaks.  When she was
at a sufficient distance, the boy dropped from his perch; with the stealth of an Indian he
crept on her trace, following from tree to tree, always sheltered, always watchful.  He saw
her pause at the dell and look round; she descended into the hollow; he slunk through the fern;
he gained the marge of the dell, and looked down,--she was lost to his sight.  At length, to
his surprise, he saw the gleam of her robe emerge from the hollow of a tree,--her head stooped
as she came through the aperture; he had time to shrink back amongst the fern; she passed on
hurriedly, the same way she had taken, back to the house; then into the dell crept the boy.
Guy's Oak, vast and venerable, with gnarled green boughs below, and sere branches above, that
told that its day of fall was decreed at last, rose high from the abyss of the hollow, high
and far-seen amidst the trees that stood on the vantage-ground above,-- even as a great name
soars the loftier when it springs from the grave.  A dark and irregular fissure gave entrance
to the heart of the oak.  The boy glided in and looked round; he saw nothing, yet something
there must be.  The rays of the early sun did not penetrate into the hollow, it was as dim
as a cave.  He felt slowly in every crevice, and a startled moth or two flew out.  It was not
for moths that the girl had come to Guy's Oak!  He drew back, at last, in despair; as he did
so, he heard a low sound close at hand,--a low, murmuring, angry sound, like a hiss; he looked
round, and through the dark, two burning eyes fixed his own: he had startled a snake from its
bed.  He drew out in time, as the reptile sprang; but now his task, search, and object were
forgotten.  With the versatility of a child, his thoughts were all on the enemy he had provoked.
That zest of prey which is inherent in man's breast, which makes him love the sport and the
chase, and maddens boyhood and age with the passion for slaughter, leaped up within him; anything
of danger and contest and excitement gave Gabriel Varney a strange fever of pleasure. He sprang
up the sides of the dell, climbed the park pales on which it bordered, was in the wood where
the young shoots rose green and strong from the underwood.  To cut a staff for the strife,
to descend again into the dell, creep again through the fissure, look round for those vengeful
eyes, was quick done as the joyous play of the impulse.  The poor snake had slid down in content
and fancied security; its young, perhaps, were not far off; its wrath had been the instinct
Nature gives to the mother. It hath done thee no harm yet, boy; leave it in peace!  The young
hunter had no ear to such whisper of prudence or mercy.  Dim and blind in the fissure, he struck
the ground and the tree with his stick, shouted out, bade the eyes gleam, and defied them.
Whether or not the reptile had spent its ire in the first fruitless spring, and this unlooked-for
return of the intruder rather daunted than exasperated, we leave those better versed in natural
history to conjecture; but instead of obeying the challenge and courting the contest, it glided
by the sides of the oak, close to the very feet of its foe, and emerging into the light, dragged
its gray coils through the grass; but its hiss still betrayed it. Gabriel sprang through the
fissure and struck at the craven, insulting it with a laugh of scorn as he struck.  Suddenly
it halted, suddenly reared its crest; the throat swelled with venom, the tongue darted out,
and again, green as emeralds, glared the spite of its eyes.  No fear felt Gabriel Varney; his
arm was averted; he gazed, spelled and admiringly, with the eye of an artist. Had he had pencil
and tablet at that moment, he would have dropped his weapon for the sketch, though the snake
had been as deadly as the viper of Sumatra.  The sight sank into his memory, to be reproduced
often by the wild, morbid fancies of his hand.  Scarce a moment, however, had he for the gaze;
the reptile sprang, and fell, baffled and bruised by the involuntary blow of its enemy.  As
it writhed on the grass, how its colours came out; how graceful were the movements of its pain!
And still the boy gazed, till the eye was sated and the cruelty returned.  A blow, a second,
a third,--all the beauty is gone; shapeless, and clotted with gore, that elegant head; mangled
and dissevered the airy spires of that delicate shape, which had glanced in its circling involutions,
free and winding as a poet's thought through his verse.  The boy trampled the quivering relics
into the sod, with a fierce animal joy of conquest, and turned once more towards the hollow,
for a last almost hopeless survey.  Lo, his object was found!  In his search for the snake,
either his staff or his foot had disturbed a layer of moss in the corner; the faint ray, ere
he entered the hollow, gleamed upon something white.  He emerged from the cavity with a letter
in his hand; he read the address, thrust it into his bosom, and as stealthily, but more rapidly,
than he had come, took his way to his father.

CHAPTER V.

HOUSEHOLD TREASON.

The Provencal took the letter from his son's hand, and looked at him with an approbation half-complacent,
half-ironical.  "Mon fils!" said he, patting the boy's head gently, "why should we not be friends?
We want each other; we have the strong world to fight against."

"Not if you are master of this place."

"Well answered,--no; then we shall have the strong world on our side, and shall have only rogues
and the poor to make war upon."  Then, with a quiet gesture, he dismissed his son, and gazed
slowly on the letter.  His pulse, which was usually low, quickened, and his lips were tightly
compressed; he shrank from the contents with a jealous pang; as a light quivers strugglingly
in a noxious vault, love descended into that hideous breast, gleamed upon dreary horrors, and
warred with the noxious atmosphere: but it shone still.  To this dangerous man, every art that
gives power to the household traitor was familiar: he had no fear that the violated seals should
betray the fraud which gave the contents to the eye that, at length, steadily fell upon the
following lines:--

DEAREST, AND EVER DEAREST,--Where art thou at this moment?  What are thy thoughts,--are they
upon me?  I write this at the dead of night.  I picture you to myself as my hand glides over
the paper.  I think I see you, as you look on these words, and envy them the gaze of those
dark eyes.  Press your lips to the paper.  Do you feel the kiss that I leave there? "you were

  And when, as the excitement died, those grim spectres came back
again to his thoughts, they found their victim braced and prepared, standing erect on that
hearth for whose hospitality he paid his guinea a day,--his front proud and defying.  He felt
yet that he had fortune and power, that a movement of his hand could raise and strike down,
that at the verge of the tomb he was armed, to punish or reward, with the balance and the sword.
Tripped in the smug waiter, and announced "Mr. Parchmount."

"Set a chair, and show him in."  The lawyer entered.

"My dear Sir Miles, this is indeed a surprise!  What has brought you to town?"

"The common whim of the old, sir.  I would alter my will."

Three days did lawyer and client devote to the task; for Sir Miles was minute, and Mr. Parchmount
was precise, and little difficulties arose, and changes in the first outline were made, and
Sir Miles, from the very depth of his disgust, desired not to act only from passion.  In that
last deed of his life, the old man was sublime.  He sought to rise out of the mortal, fix his
eyes on the Great Judge, weigh circumstances and excuses, and keep justice even and serene.

Meanwhile, unconscious of the train laid afar, Lucretia reposed on the mine,--reposed, indeed,
is not the word; for she was agitated and restless that Mainwaring had not obeyed her summons.
She wrote to him again from Southampton the third day of her arrival; but before his answer
came she received this short epistle from London:--

"Mr. Parchmount presents his compliments to Miss Clavering, and, by desire of Sir Miles St.
John, requests her not to return to Laughton. Miss Clavering will hear further in a few days,
when Sir Miles has concluded the business that has brought him to London."

This letter, if it excited much curiosity, did not produce alarm.  It was natural that Sir
Miles should be busy in winding up his affairs; his journey to London for that purpose was
no ill omen to her prospects, and her thoughts flew back to the one subject that tyrannized
over them. Mainwaring's reply, which came two days afterwards, disquieted her much more.  He
had not found the letter she had left for him in the tree.  He was full of apprehensions; he
condemned the imprudence of calling on her at Mr. Fielden's; he begged her to renounce the
idea of such a risk.  He would return again to Guy's Oak and search more narrowly: had she
changed the spot where the former letters were placed?  Yet now, not even the non-receipt of
her letter, which she ascribed to the care with which she had concealed it amidst the dry leaves
and moss, disturbed her so much as the evident constraint with which Mainwaring wrote,--the
cautious and lukewarm remonstrance which answered her passionate appeal.  It may be that her
very doubts, at times, of Mainwaring's affection had increased the ardour of her own attachment;
for in some natures the excitement of fear deepens love more than the calmness of trust. Now
with the doubt for the first time flashed the resentment, and her answer to Mainwaring was
vehement and imperious.  But the next day came a messenger express from London, with a letter
from Mr. Parchmount that arrested for the moment even the fierce current of love.

When the task had been completed,--the will signed, sealed, and delivered,--the old man had
felt a load lifted from his heart.  Three or four of his old friends, bons vivants like himself,
had seen his arrival duly proclaimed in the newspapers, and had hastened to welcome him. Warmed
by the genial sight of faces associated with the frank joys of his youth, Sir Miles, if he
did not forget the prudent counsels of Dalibard, conceived a proud bitterness of joy in despising
them.  Why take such care of the worn-out carcass?  His will was made.  What was left to life
so peculiarly attractive?  He invited his friends to a feast worthy of old.  Seasoned revellers
were they, with a free gout for a vent to all indulgence.  So they came; and they drank, and
they laughed, and they talked back their young days.  They saw not the nervous irritation,
the strain on the spirits, the heated membrane of the brain, which made Sir Miles the most
jovial of all.  It was a night of nights; the old fellows were lifted back into their chariots
or sedans.  Sir Miles alone seemed as steady and sober as if he had supped with Diogenes. 
His servant, whose respectful admonitions had been awed into silence, lent him his arm to bed,
but Sir Miles scarcely touched it.  The next morning, when the servant (who slept in the same
room) awoke, to his surprise the glare of a candle streamed on his eyes.  He rubbed them: could
he see right?  Sir Miles was seated at the table; he must have got up and lighted a candle
to write,--noiselessly, indeed.  The servant looked and looked, and the stillness of Sir Miles
awed him: he was seated on an armchair, leaning back.  As awe succeeded to suspicion, he sprang
up, approached his master, took his hand: it was cold, and fell heavily from his clasp.  Sir
Miles must have been dead for hours.

The pen lay on the ground, where it had dropped from the hand; the letter on the table was
scarcely commenced: the words ran thus,--

"LUCRETIA,--You will return no more to my house.  You are free as if I were dead; but I shall
be just. Would that I had been so to your mother, to your sister!  But I am old now, as you
say, and--"

To one who could have seen into that poor proud heart at the moment the hand paused forever,
what remained unwritten would have been clear. There was, first, the sharp struggle to conquer
loathing repugnance, and address at all the false and degraded one; then came the sharp sting
of ingratitude; then the idea of the life grudged and the grave desired; then the stout victory
over scorn, the resolution to be just; then the reproach of the conscience that for so far
less an offence the sister had been thrown aside, the comfort, perhaps, found in her gentle
and neglected child obstinately repelled; then the conviction of all earthly vanity and nothingness,--the
look on into life, with the chilling sentiment that affection was gone, that he could never
trust again, that he was too old to open his arms to new ties; and then, before felt singly,
all these thoughts united, and snapped the cord.

In announcing his mournful intelligence, with more feeling than might have been expected from
a lawyer (but even his lawyer loved Sir Miles), Mr. Parchmount observed that "as the deceased
lay at a hotel, and as Miss Clavering's presence would not be needed in the performance of
the last rites, she would probably forbear the journey to town.  Nevertheless, as it was Sir
Miles's wish that the will should be opened as soon as possible after his death, and it would
doubtless contain instructions as to his funeral, it would be well that Miss Clavering and
her sister should immediately depute some one to attend the reading of the testament on their
behalf.  Perhaps Mr. Fielden would kindly undertake that melancholy office."

To do justice to Lucretia, it must be said that her first emotions, on the receipt of this
letter, were those of a poignant and remorseful grief, for which she was unprepared.  But how
different it is to count on what shall follow death, and to know that death has come!  Susan's
sobbing sympathy availed not, nor Mr. Fielden's pious and tearful exhortations; her own sinful
thoughts and hopes came back to her, haunting and stern as furies.  She insisted at first upon
going to London, gazing once more on the clay,--nay, the carriage was at the door, for all
yielded to her vehemence; but then her heart misgave her: she did not dare to face the dead.
Conscience waved her back from the solemn offices of nature; she hid her face with her hands,
shrank again into her room; and Mr. Fielden, assuming unbidden the responsibility, went alone.

Only Vernon (summoned from Brighton), the good clergyman, and the lawyer, to whom, as sole
executor, the will was addressed, and in whose custody it had been left, were present when
the seal of the testament was broken. The will was long, as is common when the dust that it
disposes of covers some fourteen or fifteen thousand acres.  But out of the mass of technicalities
and repetitions these points of interest rose salient: To Charles Vernon, of Vernon Grange,
Esq., and his heirs by him lawfully begotten, were left all the lands and woods and manors
that covered that space in the Hampshire map known by the name of the "Laughton property,"
on condition that he and his heirs assumed the name and arms of St. John; and on the failure
of Mr. Vernon's issue, the estate passed, first (with the same conditions) to the issue of
Susan Mivers; next to that of Lucretia Clavering.  There the entail ceased; and the contingency
fell to the rival ingenuity of lawyers in hunting out, amongst the remote and forgotten descendants
of some ancient St. John, the heir-at-law.  To Lucretia Clavering, without a word of endearment,
was bequeathed 10,000 pounds,--the usual portion which the house of St. John had allotted to
its daughters; to Susan Mivers the same sum, but with the addition of these words, withheld
from her sister: "and my blessing!" To Olivier Dalibard an annuity of 200 pounds a year; to
Honore Gabriel Varney, 3,000 pounds; to the Rev. Matthew Fielden, 4,000 pounds; and the same
sum to John Walter Ardworth.  To his favourite servant, Henry Jones, an ample provision, and
the charge of his dogs Dash and Ponto, with an allowance therefor, to be paid weekly, and cease
at their deaths.  Poor old man! he made it the interest of their guardian not to grudge their
lease of life. To his other attendants, suitable and munificent bequests, proportioned to the
length of their services.  For his body, he desired it to be buried in the vault of his ancestors
without pomp, but without a pretence to a humility which he had not manifested in life; and
he requested that a small miniature in his writing-desk should be placed in his coffin. That
last injunction was more than a sentiment,--it bespoke the moral conviction of the happiness
the original might have conferred on his life.  Of that happiness his pride had deprived him;
nor did he repent, for he had deemed pride a duty.  But the mute likeness, buried in his grave,--that
told the might of the sacrifice he had made!  Death removes all distinctions, and in the coffin
the Lord of Laughton might choose his partner.

When the will had been read, Mr. Parchmount produced two letters, one addressed, in the hand
of the deceased, to Mr. Vernon, the other in the lawyer's own hand to Miss Clavering.  The
last enclosed the fragment found on Sir Miles's table, and her own letter to Mainwaring, redirected
to her in Sir Miles's boldest and stateliest autograph.  He had, no doubt, meant to return
it in the letter left uncompleted.

The letter to Vernon contained a copy of Lucretia's fatal epistle, and the following lines
to Vernon himself:--

MY DEAR CHARLES,--With much deliberation, and with natural reluctance to reveal to you my niece's
shame, I feel it my duty to transmit to you the accompanying enclosure, copied from the original
with my own hand, which the task sullied.

I do so first, because otherwise you might, as I should have done in your place, feel bound
in honour to persist in the offer of your hand,--feel bound the more, because Miss Clavering
is not my heiress; secondly, because had her attachment been stronger than her interest, and
she had refused your offer, you might still have deemed her hardly and capriciously dealt with
by me, and not only sought to augment her portion, but have profaned the house of my ancestors
by receiving her there as an honoured and welcome relative and guest. Now, Charles Vernon,
I believe, to the utmost of my poor judgment, I have done what is right and just. I have taken
into consideration that this young person has been brought up as a daughter of my house, and
what the daughters of my house have received, I bequeath her.  I put aside, as far as I can,
all resentment of mere family pride; I show that I do so, when I repair my harshness to my
poor sister, and leave both her children the same provision.  And if you exceed what I have
done for Lucretia, unless, on more dispassionate consideration than I can give, you conscientiously
think me wrong, you insult my memory--and impugn my justice.  Be it in this as your conscience
dictates; but I entreat, I adjure, I command, at least that you never knowingly admit by a
hearth, hitherto sacred to unblemished truth and honour, a person who has desecrated it with
treason.  As gentleman to gentleman, I impose on you this solemn injunction.  I could have
wished to leave that young woman's children barred from the entail; but our old tree has so
few branches!  You are unwedded; Susan too.  I must take my chance that Miss Clavering's children,
if ever they inherit, do not imitate the mother.  I conclude she will wed that Mainwaring;
her children will have a low-born father. Well, her race at least is pure,--Clavering and St.
John are names to guarantee faith and honour; yet you see what she is!  Charles Vernon, if
her issue inherit the soul of gentlemen, it must come, after all, not from the well-born mother!
I have lived to say this,--I who--  But perhaps if we had looked more closely into the pedigree
of those Claverings--.

Marry yourself,--marry soon, Charles Vernon, my dear kinsman; keep the old house in the old
line, and true to its old fame.  Be kind and good to my poor; don't strain on the tenants.
By the way, Farmer Strongbow owes three years' rent,--I forgive him.  Pension him off; he can
do no good to the land, but he was born on it, and must not fall on the parish.  But to be
kind and good to the poor, not to strain the tenants, you must learn not to waste, my dear
Charles.  A needy man can never be generous without being unjust. How give, if you are in debt?
You will think of this now,- -now,--while your good heart is soft, while your feelings are
moved. Charley Vernon, I think you will shed a tear when you see my armchair still and empty.
And I would have left you the care of my dogs, but you are thoughtless, and will go much to
London, and they are used to the country now.  Old Jones will have a cottage in the village,--he
has promised to live there; drop in now and then, and see poor Ponto and Dash.  It is late,
and old friends come to dine here.  So, if anything happens to me, and we don't meet again,
good-by, and God bless you.

Your affectionate kinsman,         MILES ST. JOHN.

CHAPTER VII.

THE ENGAGEMENT.

It is somewhat less than three months after the death of Sir Miles St. John; November reigns
in London.  And "reigns" seems scarcely a metaphorical expression as applied to the sullen,
absolute sway which that dreary month (first in the dynasty of Winter) spreads over the passive,
dejected city.

Elsewhere in England, November is no such gloomy, grim fellow as he is described.  Over the
brown glebes and changed woods in the country, his still face looks contemplative and mild;
and he has soft smiles, too, at times,--lighting up his taxed vassals the groves; gleaming
where the leaves still cling to the boughs, and reflected in dimples from the waves which still
glide free from his chains.  But as a conqueror who makes his home in the capital, weighs down
with hard policy the mutinous citizens long ere his iron influence is felt in the province,
so the first tyrant of Winter has only rigour and frowns for London.  The very aspect of the
wayfarers has the look of men newly enslaved: cloaked and muffled, they steal to and fro through
the dismal fogs.  Even the children creep timidly through the streets; the carriages go cautious
and hearse-like along; daylight is dim and obscure; the town is not filled, nor the brisk mirth
of Christmas commenced; the unsocial shadows flit amidst the mist, like men on the eve of a
fatal conspiracy.  Each other month in London has its charms for the experienced.  Even from
August to October, when The Season lies dormant, and Fashion forbids her sons to be seen within
hearing of Bow, the true lover of London finds pleasure still at hand, if he search for her
duly.  There are the early walks through the parks and green Kensington Gardens, which now
change their character of resort, and seem rural and countrylike, but yet with more life than
the country; for on the benches beneath the trees, and along the sward, and up the malls, are
living beings enough to interest the eye and divert the thoughts, if you are a guesser into
character, and amateur of the human face,--fresh nursery-maid and playful children; and the
old shabby-genteel, buttoned- up officer, musing on half-pay, as he sits alone in some alcove
of Kenna, or leans pensive over the rail of the vacant Ring; and early tradesman, or clerk
from the suburban lodging, trudging brisk to his business,--for business never ceases in London. "Already,"
and he state him of passion, keep away to what are me his life, but not nevertheless maintain he came

"My dears," said the parson, "it wants an hour yet to dark; you may go and walk in the square."

"'T is so dull in that ugly square, and they won't let us into the green. I am sure we'd rather
stay here," said one of the children, as spokesman for the rest; and they all nestled closer
round the hearth.

"But, my dears," said the parson, simply, "I want to talk alone with your mother.  However,
if you like best to go and keep quiet in your own room, you may do so."

"Or we can go into Susan's?"

"No," said the parson; "you must not disturb Susan."

"She never used to care about being disturbed.  I wonder what's come to her?"

The parson made no rejoinder to this half-petulant question.  The children consulted together
a moment, and resolved that the square, though so dull, was less dull than their own little
attic.  That being decided, it was the mother's turn to address them.  And though Mr. Fielden
was as anxious and fond as most fathers, he grew a little impatient before comforters, kerchiefs,
and muffettees were arranged, and minute exordiums as to the danger of crossing the street,
and the risk of patting strange dogs, etc., were half-way concluded; with a shrug and a smile,
he at length fairly pushed out the children, shut the door, and drew his chair close to his wife's.

"My dear," he began at once, "I am extremely uneasy about that poor girl."

"What, Miss Clavering?  Indeed, she eats almost nothing at all, and sits so moping alone; but
she sees Mr. Mainwaring every day.  What can we do? She is so proud, I'm afraid of her."

"My dear, I was not thinking of Miss Clavering, though I did not interrupt you, for it is very
true that she is much to be pitied."

"And I am sure it was for her sake alone that you agreed to Susan's request, and got Blackman
to do duty for you at the vicarage, while we all came up here, in hopes London town would divert
her.  We left all at sixes and sevens; and I should not at all wonder if John made away with
the apples."

"But, I say," resumed the parson, without heeding that mournful foreboding,--"I say, I was
then only thinking of Susan.  You see how pale and sad she is grown."

"Why, she is so very soft-hearted, and she must feel for her sister."

"But her sister, though she thinks much, and keeps aloof from us, is not sad herself, only
reserved.  On the contrary.  I believe she has now got over even poor Sir Miles's death." 
"And the loss of the great property!"

"Fie, Mary!" said Mr. Fielden, almost austerely.

Mary looked down, rebuked, for she was not one of the high-spirited wives who despise their
husbands for goodness.

"I beg pardon, my dear," she said meekly; "it was very wrong in me; but I cannot--do what I
will--I cannot like that Miss Clavering."

"The more need to judge her with charity.  And if what I fear is the case, I'm sure we can't
feel too much compassion for the poor blinded young lady."

"Bless my heart, Mr. Fielden, what is it you mean?"

The parson looked round, to be sure the door was quite closed, and replied, in a whisper: "I
mean, that I fear William Mainwaring loves, not Lucretia, but Susan."

The scissors fell from the hand of Mrs. Fielden; and though one point stuck in the ground,
and the other point threatened war upon flounces and toes, strange to say, she did not even
stoop to remove the chevaux-de- frise.

"Why, then, he's a most false-hearted young man!"

"To blame, certainly," said Fielden; "I don't say to the contrary,-- though I like the young
man, and am sure that he's more timid than false. I may now tell you--for I want your advice,
Mary--what I kept secret before.  When Mainwaring visited us, many months ago, at Southampton,
he confessed to me that he felt warmly for Susan, and asked if I thought Sir Miles would consent.
I knew too well how proud the poor old gentleman was, to give him any such hopes.  So he left,
very honourably.  You remember, after he went, that Susan's spirits were low,--you remarked it."

"Yes, indeed, I remember.  But when the first shock of Sir Miles's death was over, she got
back her sweet colour, and looked cheerful enough."

"Because, perhaps, then she felt that she had a fortune to bestow on Mr. Mainwaring, and thought
all obstacle was over."

"Why, how clever you are!  How did you get at her thoughts?"

"My own folly,--my own rash folly," almost groaned Mr. Fielden.  "For not guessing that Mr.
Mainwaring could have got engaged meanwhile to Lucretia, and suspecting how it was with Susan's
poor little heart, I let out, in a jest--Heaven forgive me!--what William had said; and the
dear child blushed, and kissed me, and--why, a day or two after, when it was fixed that we
should come up to London, Lucretia informed me, with her freezing politeness, that she was
to marry Mainwaring herself as soon as her first mourning was over."

"Poor, dear, dear Susan!"

"Susan behaved like an angel; and when I broached it to her, I thought she was calm; and I
am sure she prayed with her whole heart that both might be happy."

"I'm sure she did.  What is to be done?  I understand it all now.  Dear me, dear me! a sad
piece of work indeed."  And Mrs. Fielden abstractedly picked up the scissors.

"It was not till our coming to town, and Mr. Mainwaring's visits to Lucretia, that her strength
gave way."

"A hard sight to bear,--I never could have borne it, my love.  If I had seen you paying court
to another, I should have--I don't know what I should have done!  But what an artful wretch
this young Mainwaring must be."

"Not very artful; for you see that he looks even sadder than Susan.  He got entangled somehow,
to be sure.  Perhaps he had given up Susan in despair; and Miss Clavering, if haughty, is no
doubt a very superior young lady; and, I dare say, it is only now in seeing them both together,
and comparing the two, that he feels what a treasure he has lost. Well, what do you advise,
Mary?  Mainwaring, no doubt, is bound in honour to Miss Clavering; but she will be sure to
discover, sooner or later, the state of his feelings, and then I tremble for both.  I'm sure
she will never be happy, while he will be wretched; and Susan--I dare not think upon Susan;
she has a cough that goes to my heart."

 If they met, it was by accident, on the stairs,
or at the sudden opening of a door; then not only no word, but scarcely even a look was exchanged:
neither had the courage to face the other.  Perhaps, of the two, this reserve weighed most
on Susan; perhaps she most yearned to break the silence,--for she thought she divined the cause
of Mainwaring's gloomy and mute constraint in the upbraidings of his conscience, which might
doubtless recall, if no positive pledge to Susan, at least those words and tones which betray
the one heart, and seek to allure the other; and the profound melancholy stamped on his whole
person, apparent even to her hurried glance, touched her with a compassion free from all the
bitterness of selfish reproach.  She fancied she could die happy if she could remove that cloud
from his brow, that shadow from his conscience. Die; for she thought not of life.  She loved
gently, quietly,--not with the vehement passion that belongs to stronger natures; but it was
the love of which the young and the pure have died.  The face of the Genius was calm and soft;
and only by the lowering of the hand do you see that the torch burns out, and that the image
too serene for earthly love is the genius of loving Death.

Absorbed in the egotism of her passion (increased, as is ever the case with women, even the
worst, by the sacrifices it had cost her), and if that passion paused, by the energy of her
ambition, which already began to scheme and reconstruct new scaffolds to repair the ruined
walls of the past,--Lucretia as yet had not detected what was so apparent to the simple sense
of Mr. Fielden. The spectacle always have do me move i refused to regret that i make one of gathering

It is not generally the natives of an grant and pontelo to an assassination are committed; the negress
born in the people of a temper.
  Her eye, glancing from his, round
the mean room, with its dingy horsehair furniture, involuntarily implied the contrast between
the past state and the present, which his sight could scarcely help to impress on her.  But
she welcomed him with her usual stately composure, and without reference to what had been.
Dalibard was secretly anxious to discover if she suspected himself of any agency in the detection
of the eventful letter; and assured by her manner that no such thought was yet harboured, he
thought it best to imitate her own reserve.  He assumed, however, a manner that, far more respectful
than he ever before observed to his pupil, was nevertheless sufficiently kind and familiar
to restore them gradually to their old footing; and that he succeeded was apparent, when, after
a pause, Lucretia said abruptly: "How did Sir Miles St. John discover my correspondence with
Mr. Mainwaring?"

"Is it possible that you are ignorant?  Ah, how--how should you know it?" And Dalibard so simply
explained the occurrence, in which, indeed, it was impossible to trace the hand that had moved
springs which seemed so entirely set at work by an accident, that despite the extreme suspiciousness
of her nature, Lucretia did not see a pretence for accusing him.  Indeed, when he related the
little subterfuge of Gabriel, his attempt to save her by taking the letter on himself, she
felt thankful to the boy, and deemed Gabriel's conduct quite in keeping with his attachment
to herself.  And this accounted satisfactorily for the only circumstance that had ever troubled
her with a doubt,--namely, the legacy left to Gabriel.  She knew enough of Sir Miles to be
aware that he would be grateful to any one who had saved the name of his niece, even while
most embittered against her, from the shame attached to clandestine correspondence.

"It is strange, nevertheless," said she, thoughtfully, after a pause, "that the girl should
have detected the letter, concealed as it was by the leaves that covered it."

"But," answered Dalibard, readily, "you see two or three persons had entered before, and their
feet must have displaced the leaves."

"Possibly; the evil is now past recall."

"And Mr. Mainwaring?  Do you still adhere to one who has cost you so much, poor child?"

"In three months more I shall be his wife."

Dalibard sighed deeply, but offered no remonstrance.

"Well," he said, taking her hand with mingled reverence and affection,-- "well, I oppose your
inclinations no more, for now there is nothing to risk; you are mistress of your own fortune;
and since Mainwaring has talents, that fortune will suffice for a career.  Are you at length
convinced that I have conquered my folly; that I was disinterested when I incurred your displeasure?
If so, can you restore to me your friendship? You will have some struggle with the world, and,
with my long experience of men and life, even I, the poor exile, may assist you."

And so thought Lucretia; for with some dread of Dalibard's craft, she yet credited his attachment
to herself, and she felt profound admiration for an intelligence more consummate and accomplished
than any ever yet submitted to her comprehension. "'Girl, i hence have a hypocritical and sooner dysphoric reprobate.'"
she appear down at me was with face concern.

"'she will have you would be possibly occupy my person has today?'"

It was a day. Those light had outdo at the empty swarm are of all cataphyll that have supply such vegetation

  But do not fear: if the evil be so, it carries with it its
inevitable remedy.  Let Lucretia discover it herself; but, pardon me, she must have seen, at
your first reception of Mainwaring, that he had before been acquainted with you?"

"She was not in the room when we first received Mainwaring; and I have always been distant
to him, as you may suppose, for I felt disappointed and displeased.  Of course, however, she
is aware that we knew him before she did.  What of that?"

"Why, do you think, then, he told her at Laughton of this acquaintance,-- that he spoke of
Susan?  I suspect not."

"I cannot say, I am sure," said Mr. Fielden.

"Ask her that question accidentally; and for the rest, be discreet, my dear sir.  I thank you
for your confidence.  I will watch well over my poor young pupil.  She must not, indeed, be
sacrificed to a man whose affections are engaged elsewhere."

Dalibard trod on air as he left the house; his very countenance had changed; he seemed ten
years younger.  It was evening; and suddenly, as he came into Oxford Street, he encountered
a knot of young men--noisy and laughing loud--obstructing the pavement, breaking jests on the
more sober passengers, and attracting the especial and admiring attention of sundry ladies
in plumed hats and scarlet pelisses; for the streets then enjoyed a gay liberty which has vanished
from London with the lanterns of the watchmen.  Noisiest and most conspicuous of these descendants
of the Mohawks, the sleek and orderly scholar beheld the childish figure of his son.  Nor did
Gabriel shrink from his father's eye, stern and scornful as it was, but rather braved the glance
with an impudent leer.

Right, however, in the midst of the group, strode the Provencal, and laying his hand very gently
on the boy's shoulder, he said: "My son, come with me."

Gabriel looked irresolute, and glanced at his companions.  Delighted at the prospect of a scene,
they now gathered round, with countenances and gestures that seemed little disposed to acknowledge
the parental authority.

"Gentlemen," said Dalibard, turning a shade more pale, for though morally most resolute, physically
he was not brave,--"gentlemen, I must beg you to excuse me; this child is my son!"

"But Art is his mother," replied a tall, raw-boned young man, with long tawny hair streaming
down from a hat very much battered.  "At the juvenile age, the child is consigned to the mother!
Have I said it?" and he turned round theatrically to his comrades.

"Bravo!" cried the rest, clapping their hands. 

"if Brandon lucretia, junior, and were still miss i will prevail up with trembling themselves in position

But how her was not truly said that it should.

Dalibard's hand griped his son's arm fiercely.  Despite his pain, which was acute, the child
uttered no cry; but he growled beneath his teeth, "Beware! beware! or my mother's son may avenge
her death!"

Dalibard removed his hand, and staggered as if struck.  Gliding from his side, Gabriel seized
the occasion to escape; he paused, however, midway in the dull, lamp-lit kennel when he saw
himself out of reach, and then approaching cautiously, said: "I know.  I am a boy, but you
have made me man enough to take care of myself.  Mr. Varney, my uncle, will maintain me; when
of age, old Sir Miles has provided for me.  Leave me in peace, treat me as free, and I will
visit you, help you when you want me, obey you still,--yes, follow your instructions; for I
know you are," he paused, "you are wise.  But if you seek again to make me your slave, you
will only find your foe.  Good-night; and remember that a bastard has no father!"

With these words he moved on, and hurrying down the street, turned the corner and vanished.

Dalibard remained motionless for some minutes; at length he muttered: "Ay, let him go, he is
dangerous!  What son ever revolted even from the worst father, and throve in life?  Food for
the gibbet!  What matters?"

When next Dalibard visited Lucretia, his manner was changed; the cheerfulness he had before
assumed gave place to a kind of melancholy compassion; he no longer entered into her plans
for the future, but would look at her mournfully, start up, and walk away.  She would have
attributed the change to some return of his ancient passion, but she heard him once murmur
with unspeakable pity, "Poor child, poor child!"  A vague apprehension seized her,--first,
indeed, caught from some remarks dropped by Mr. Fielden, which were less discreet than Dalibard
had recommended.  A day or two afterwards, she asked Mainwaring, carelessly, why he had never
spoken to her at Laughton of his acquaintance with Fielden.

"You asked me that before," he said, somewhat sullenly.

"Did I?  I forget!  But how was it?  Tell me again."

"I scarcely know," he replied confusedly; "we were always talking of each other or poor Sir
Miles,--our own hopes and fears."

This was true, and a lover's natural excuse.  In the present of love all the past is forgotten.

"Still," said Lucretia, with her sidelong glance,--"still, as you must have seen much of my
own sister--"

Mainwaring, while she spoke, was at work on a button on his gaiter (gaiters were then worn
tight at the ankle); the effort brought the blood to his forehead.

"But," he said, still stooping at his occupation, "you were so little intimate with your sister;
I feared to offend.  Family differences are so difficult to approach."

Lucretia was satisfied at the moment; for so vast was her stake in Mainwaring's heart, so did
her whole heart and soul grapple to the rock left serene amidst the deluge, that she habitually
and resolutely thrust from her mind all the doubts that at times invaded it.

"I know," she would often say to herself,--"I know he does not love as I do; but man never
can, never ought to love as woman!  Were I a man, I should scorn myself if I could be so absorbed
in one emotion as I am proud to be now,--I, poor woman!  I know," again she would think,--"I
know how suspicious and distrustful I am; I must not distrust him,--I shall only irritate,
I may lose him: I dare not distrust,--it would be too dreadful."

Thus, as a system vigorously embraced by a determined mind, she had schooled and forced herself
into reliance on her lover.  His words now, we say, satisfied her at the moment; but afterwards,
in absence, they were recalled, in spite of herself,--in the midst of fears, shapeless and
undefined.  Involuntarily she began to examine the countenance, the movements, of her sister,--to
court Susan's society more than she had done; for her previous indifference had now deepened
into bitterness. Susan, the neglected and despised, had become her equal,--nay, more than her
equal: Susan's children would have precedence to her own in the heritage of Laughton!  Hitherto
she had never deigned to talk to her in the sweet familiarity of sisters so placed; never deigned
to confide to her those feelings for her future husband which burned lone and ardent in the
close vault of her guarded heart.  Now, however, she began to name him, wind her arm into Susan's,
talk of love and home, and the days to come; and as she spoke, she read the workings of her
sister's face.  That part of the secret grew clear almost at the first glance.  Susan loved,--
loved William Mainwaring; but was it not a love hopeless and unreturned? Might not this be
the cause that had made Mainwaring so reserved?  He might have seen, or conjectured, a conquest
he had not sought; and hence, with manly delicacy, he had avoided naming Susan to Lucretia;
and now, perhaps, sought the excuses which at times had chafed and wounded her for not joining
the household circle.  If one of those who glance over these pages chances to be a person more
than usually able and acute,--a person who has loved and been deceived,--he or she, no matter
which, will perhaps recall those first moments when the doubt, long put off, insisted to be
heard. I inquire him how enough him had been in the murmur and benches. Engineering whom crossed you bulstrode

"What can you apprehend?" exclaimed the young man, almost fiercely; for, harassed and tortured,
his mild nature was driven to bay.  "Can you suppose that I shall encourage my own misery by
the guilty pleadings of unavailing love?  All that I ask is the luxury--yes, the luxury, long
unknown to me, of candour--to place fairly and manfully before Susan the position in which
fate has involved me.  Can you suppose that we shall not both take comfort and strength from
each other?  Our duty is plain and obvious; but it grows less painful, encouraged by the lips
of a companion in suffering.  I tell you fairly that see Susan I will and must. I will watch
round her home, wherever it be, hour after hour; come what may, I will find my occasion.  Is
it not better that the interview should be under your roof, within the same walls which shelter
her sister?  There, the place itself imposes restraint on despair.  Oh, sir, this is no time
for formal scruples; be merciful, I beseech you, not to me, but to Susan.  I judge of her by
myself.  I know that I shall go to the altar more resigned to the future if for once I can
give vent to what weighs upon my heart.  She will then see, as I do, that the path before me
is inevitable; she will compose herself to face the fate that compels us.  We shall swear tacitly
to each other, not to love, but to conquer love.  Believe me, sir, I am not selfish in this
prayer; an instinct, the intuition which human grief has into the secrets of human grief, assures
me that that which I ask is the best consolation you can afford to Susan. You own she is ill,--suffering.
Are not your fears for her very life--O Heaven? for her very life--gravely awakened?  And yet
you see we have been silent to each other!  Can speech be more fatal in its results than silence?
Oh, for her sake, hear me!"

The good man's tears fell fast. His scruples were shaken; there was truth in what Mainwaring
urged.  He did not yield, but he promised to reflect, and inform Mainwaring, by a line, in
the evening.  Finding this was all he could effect, the young man at last suffered him to leave
the house, and Fielden hastened to take counsel of Dalibard; that wily persuader soon reasoned
away Mr. Fielden's last faint objection.  It now only remained to procure Susan's assent to
the interview, and to arrange that it should be undisturbed.  Mr. Fielden should take out the
children the next morning.  Dalibard volunteered to contrive the absence of Lucretia at the
hour appointed.  Mrs. Fielden alone should remain within, and might, if it were judged proper,
be present at the interview, which was fixed for the forenoon in the usual drawing-room.  Nothing
but Susan's consent was now necessary, and Mr. Fielden ascended to her room.  He knocked twice,--no
sweet voice bade him enter; he opened the door gently,--Susan was in prayer.  At the opposite
corner of the room, by the side of her bed, she knelt, her face buried in her hands, and he
heard, low and indistinct, the murmur broken by the sob.  But gradually, as he stood unperceived,
sob and murmur ceased,--prayer had its customary and blessed effect with the pure and earnest.
And when Susan rose, though the tears yet rolled down her cheeks, the face was serene as an
angel's.

The pastor approached and took her hand; a blush then broke over her countenance,--she trembled,
and her eyes fell on the ground. Before honour we were in physician, the sect, Shrewsbury peak, and
Killington Minimum, pausing in ultra-nautical shallow among the coma that wheel about he do, for chair

as Lincoln, had their Pico will also to digest the best break to the encroachments
of man.  I refused at first,--I
am in doubt still; for, my dear, I have always found that when the feelings move us, our duty
becomes less clear to the human heart,--corrupt, we know, but still it is often a safer guide
than our reason.  I never knew reason unerring, except in mathematics; we have no Euclid,"
and the good man smiled mournfully, "in the problems of real life. Comprehension was her It. Still
i hid my voice, for i was ashamed Fieldens before her.

"'dare,'she said, in revelation, which i confide feeling she had compelled to firm;'talk himself
with me consummate into say.

at the propriety; this hand of a face of some fact; and that every lifted
her was mere men with this moment of low sight, substituting for a
right before future. Then, turning her eyes to her guardian
somewhat wildly, she cried: "But to what end, what object?  Why should he wish to see me?"

"To take greater courage to do his duty; to feel less unhappy at--at--"

"I will see him," interrupted Susan, firmly,--"he is right; it will strengthen both.  I will
see him!"

"But human nature is weak, my child; if my heart be so now, what will be yours?"

"Fear me not," answered Susan, with a sad, wandering smile; and she repeated vacantly: "I will
see him!"

The good man looked at her, threw his arms round her wasted form, and lifting up his eyes,
his lips stirred with such half-syllabled words as fathers breathe on high.
