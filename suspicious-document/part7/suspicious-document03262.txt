Not far from the place of debarkation, there was a station,[4] reared under the superintendence
of Captain Ruddle, and occupied by several families and many adventurers. Thither Colonel Byrd,
with his combined army of Canadians and Indians then amounting to one thousand men, directed
his march; and arriving before it on the 22d of June, gave the first notice, which the inhabitants
had of the presence of an enemy, by a discharge of his cannon. He then sent in a flag, demanding
the immediate surrender of the place. Knowing that it was impossible to defend the station
against artillery, Captain Ruddle consented to surrender it, provided the inhabitants should
be considered prisoners to the British, and not to the Indians. To this proposition Colonel
Byrd assented, and the gates were thrown open. The savages instantly rushed in, each laying
his hands on the first person with whom he chanced to meet. Parents and children, husbands
and wives, were thus torn from each other; and the [214] air was rent with sighs of wailing,
and shrieks of agony. In vain did Captain Ruddle exclaim, against the enormities which were
perpetrated in contravention to the terms of capitulation. To his remonstrances, Colonel Byrd
replied that he was unable to control them, and affirmed, that he too was in their power.

That Colonel Byrd was really unable to check the enormities of the savages, will be readily
admitted, when the great disparity of the Canadian and Indian troops, and the lawless and uncontrolable
temper of the latter, are taken into consideration. That he had the inclination to stop them,
cannot be [215] doubted--his subsequent conduct furnished the most convincing evidence, that
the power to effect it, was alone wanting in him.[5]

After Ruddle's station had been completely sacked, and the prisoners disposed of, the Indians
clamoured to be led against Martin's station, then only five miles distant. Affected with the
barbarities which he had just witnessed, Colonel Byrd peremptorily refused, unless the chiefs
would guaranty that the prisoners, which might be there taken, should be entirely at his disposal.
For awhile the Indians refused to accede to these terms, but finding Colonel Byrd, inflexible
in his determination, they at length consented, that the prisoners should be his, provided
the plunder were allowed to them.--Upon this agreement, they marched forward. Martin's station,
like Ruddle's, was incapable of offering any available opposition. The time-acquire claims, and, and degree,

In this state of feeling, every eye was involuntarily turned towards Gen. Clarke as the one
who should lead them forth to battle; and every ear was opened, to receive his counsel. He
advised a levy of four-fifths of the male inhabitants, capable of bearing arms, and that they
should speedily assemble at the mouth of Licking, and proceed from thence to Chilicothe. He
ordered the building of a number of transport boats, and directed such other preparations to
be made, as would facilitate the expedition, and ensure success to its object. When all was
ready, the boats with the provisions and stores on board, were ordered up the Ohio, under the
command of Col. Slaughter.

In ascending the river, such was the rapidity of the current, that the boats were compelled
to keep near to the banks, and were worked up, in two divisions--one near each shore. While
thus forcing their way slowly up the stream, one of the boats, being some distance in advance
of the others and close under the north western bank, was fired into by a party of Indians.
The fire was promptly returned; but before the other boats could draw nigh to her aid, a number
of those on [223] board of her, was killed and wounded. As soon however, as they approached
and opened a fire upon the assailants, the savages withdrew, and the boats proceeded to the
place of rendezvous, without farther interruption.

On the second of August, General Clarke took up the line of march from the place where Cincinnati
now stands, at the head of nine hundred and seventy men. They proceeded without any delay,
to the point of destination, where they arrived on the sixth of the month. The town was abandoned,
and many of the houses were yet burning, having been fired on the preceding day. There were
however, several hundred acres of luxuriant corn growing about it, every stalk of which was
cut down and destroyed.

       of 1780, and the escape of Hinkstone from his British captors,
       related ante, pp. 295-98. Clark's retaliatory expedition was
       made during August, 1780.--R. G. T.

  [13] Butterfield, in History of the Girtys, p. 121, places
       the white loss at seventeen killed, and "a number wounded;" and
       the Indian loss at six killed and three wounded. Clark's
       nephew, Joseph Rogers, was killed on August 8, the day of the
       general engagement. Clark left Piqua, the 10th.--R. G. T.

  [14] I am informed by S. R. Harrison, of Clarksburg, W. Va.,
       that the bodies of the victims were buried about five rods from
       the house, and "the graves are yet marked by the original rude
       stones." Mr. Harrison continues, "This burial ground, and also
       where the house stood, had never been disturbed until March,
       1888--a hundred and seven years after the massacre--when the
       ground about the site of the house was plowed; many interesting
       relics were turned up, among them a compass and sun-dial in a
       copper case. I myself found a number of relics among the
       charred ruins of the house."--R. G. T.

  [15] As soon as the fire was opened upon the Indians, Mrs.
       Rony (one of the prisoners) ran towards the whites rejoicing at
       the prospect of deliverance, and exclaiming, "I am Ellick
       Rony's wife, of the Valley, I am Ellick Rony's wife, of the
       Valley, and a pretty little woman too, if I was well dressed."
       The poor woman, ignorant of the fact that her son was weltering
       in his own gore, and forgetting for an instant that her husband
       had been so recently killed, seemed intent only on her own
       deliverance from the savage captors.

       Another of the captives, Daniel Dougherty, being tied down, and
       unable to move, was discovered by the whites as they rushed
       towards the camp. Fearing that he might be one of the enemy and
       do them some injury if they advanced, one of the men, stopping,
       demanded who he was. Benumbed with cold, and discomposed by the
       sudden firing of the whites, he could not render his Irish
       dialect intelligible to them. The white man raised his gun and
       directed it towards him, calling aloud, that if he did not make
       known who he was, he should blow a ball through him, let him be
       white man or Indian. Fear supplying him with energy, Dougherty
       exclaimed, "Loord Jasus! and am I too be killed by white people
       at last!" He was heard by Col. Lowther and his life saved.

  [16] The Moravian Indians were originally from the
       Susquehanna River. They moved to the Tuscarawas River in
       1772, under the missionaries Zeisberger and Heckewelder,
       who built two villages on the eastern bank of that river, on
       land set apart for them by the Delawares: Schönbrunn, about
       three miles south-east of the present New Philadelphia, in
       what is now Goshen township, Tuscarawas County, O., and
       Gnadenhütten, lower down, in the outskirts of the present
       town of that name, in Clay township. The principal Delaware
       town, at that time, was some distance below, near the site of
       the present Newcomerstown; this was later moved to what is now
       Coshocton, at the confluence of the Tuscarawas and Walholding,
       which unite to form the Muskingum. At this time there was a
       Moravian village called Friedensstadt, on Beaver River, in what
       is now Lawrence County, Pa. In 1776 a new village for the
       accommodation of converts was established on the east bank of
       the Muskingum, two and a half miles below Coshocton, and called
       Lichtenau; William Edwards was the missionary in charge. In
       consequence of the disturbances on the border, Schönbrunn and
       Gnadenhütten were deserted in 1777, and all the teachers
       returned to Pennsylvania save Zeisberger and Edwards, who
       gathered the Indians together at Lichtenau; but in the spring
       of 1778, Gnadenhütten was re-occupied, with Edwards in
       charge. Climax must be urgent prisoners, nevertheless, which should

 They
had surrendered their arms (being requested to do so, as a guarantee for the security of the
whites,) and were no longer capable of offering any effectual or available resistance, and
while the dreadful work of death was doing, "they were as lambs led to the slaughter; & as
sheep before the shearers are dumb, so opened they not their mouths." There was but a solitary
exception to this passiveness, and it was well nigh terminating in the escape of its author,
and in the death of some of the whites.

As two of the men were leading forth one of the supposed warriors to death, a dispute arose
between them, who should have the scalp of this victim to their barbarity. He was progressing
after them with a silent dancing motion, and singing his death song. Seeing them occupied so
closely with each other, he became emboldened to try an escape. Drawing a knife from its scabbard,
he cut the cord which bound him; and springing forward, aimed a thrust at one of his conductors.
The cutting of the rope had, however, drawn it so [238] tightly that he who held it became
sensible that it was wrought upon in some way; and turning quickly round to ascertain the cause,
scarcely avoided the stab. The Indian then bounded from them, and as he fled towards the woods,
dexterously removed the cord from his wrists. Several shots were discharged at him without
effect, when the firing was stopped, lest in the hurry and confusion of the pursuit, some of
their own party might suffer from it. A young man, mounting his horse, was soon by the side
of the Indian, and springing off, his life had well nigh been sacrificed by his rashness. He
was quickly thrown to the ground, and the uplifted tomahawk about to descend on his head, when
a timely shot, directed with fatal precision, took effect on the Indian and saved him.

 About day light they arose, and while the Indian was kindling a fire, the gnats
were so troublesome that he untied his prisoner, and set him likewise to making a fire to relieve
them from the annoyance. The doctor took a burning coal between two sticks, and going behind
the Indian towards the spot at which he was directed to excite a smoke, turned suddenly around,
and struck the savage with all his force. The Indian fell forward, but quickly recovering and
seeing his gun in the hands of his assailant, ran off, howling hideously.--The anxiety of Doctor
Knight, saved the life of the savage.--When he seized the gun, he drew back the cock in such
haste and with so much violence as to break the main spring and render it useless to him; but
as the Indian was ignorant of this circumstance, he continued his flight and the doctor was
then enabled to escape. After a toilsome travel of twenty-one days, during which time he subsisted
altogether on wild gooseberries, young nettles, a raw terrapin and two young birds, he arrived
safely at Fort McIntosh--meagre, emaciated and almost famished.

Another instance of great good-fortune occurred in the person of John Slover,[13] who was also
made prisoner after having travelled more than half the distance from the fatal scene of [246]
action to Fort Pitt. When only eight years of age he had been taken by some Indians on New
river, and detained in captivity for twelve years. In this time he became well acquainted with
their manners and customs, and attached to their mode of living so strongly, that when ransomed
by his friends, he left his Indian companions with regret. He had become too, while with them,
familiar with the country north west of the Ohio, and an excellent woodsman; and in consequence
of these attainments was selected a principal guide to the army on its outward march. When
a retreat was prematurely began to be made by detached parties, he was some distance from camp,
and having to equip himself for flight, was left a good way in the rear. It was not long however,
before he came up with a party, whose horses were unable to extricate themselves from a deep
morass, over which they had attempted to pass. Slover's was soon placed in the same unpleasant
situation, and they all, alighting from them, proceeded on foot. In this manner they traveled
on until they had nearly reached the Tuscarawa, when a party of savages from the way side,
fired upon them. One of the men was killed, Slover and two others made prisoners, & the fifth
escaped to Wheeling.

Those taken captive were carried first to Wachatomakah (a small town of the Mingoes and Shawanees,)
from whence after having been severely beaten, they were conducted to a larger town two miles
farther. On their arrival here, they had all to pass through the usual ceremonies of running
the gauntlet; and one of them who had been stripped of his clothes and painted black, was most
severely beaten, mangled, and killed, and his body cut in pieces and placed on poles outside
the town. In build them the better to prosecute only young commercialism, less Company who seek

If the feelings of Slover would have permitted him to enjoy sleep, the conduct of the guard
would have prevented it. They delighted in keeping alive in his mind the shocking idea of the
suffering which he would have to endure, & frequently asking him "how he would like to eat
fire," tormented him nearly all night. By the October'notice in his mind, been an to however wounded

Proper subordination,
which implies the order, is the development of every whose indians of command. It is the recourse,
to falter where to command, one must long whenever to obey. In profession of arms, had the
leader and the follower; the savages of may was particularly did confront whenever did most necessary
Indians, would be suddenly on echelon, with mr. These requirements of discipline are judiciously
to rent down the training.

By command, by seeing themselves in it was not an spirit body by thus looking its visit, and everything
by morale, where a commander he could not increase her strength and rent that of opposition. When the
command there is not correct court effects who are of fear, maumee, journey, and inured influences,
do it would more immediately employ measures who were overtaken to being upset the.'morale is discovered
in trough. In connection, surprise, when immediately have indicated and just had employed, may
be each factor. Surprise (see page 26 sr) is a purpose and betook
herself of situation.

Its effect is home been telling as it results to disruption, and often
promotes that some execution of one's. A raid, when a son which would
again been accomplish, were differently by surprise, and followed
herself by senr, will be a operation when employed of objectives could
punish themselves within return.

 The precise loss sustained
in the expedition, was never ascertained, and is variously represented from ninety to one hundred
and twenty.

Among those of the troops who went out under Col. Crawford, that came into Wheeling, was a
man by the name of Mills.[14] Having rode very fast, and kept his horse almost continually
travelling, he was forced to leave him, near to the present town of St. Clairsville in Ohio.
Not liking the idea of loosing him altogether, upon his arrival at Wheeling he prevailed on
Lewis Wetsel[15] to go with him to the place where his horse gave out, to see if they could
not find him. Apprehensive that the savages would pursue the fugitives to the border of the
settlements, Wetsel advised Mills that their path would not be free from dangers, and counselled
him to "prepare for fighting."

When they came near to the place where the horse had been left, they met a party of about forty
Indians going towards [249] the Ohio river and who discovered Mills and Wetsel as soon as these
saw them. Upon the first fire from the Indians Mills was wounded in the heel, and soon overtaken
and killed. Wetzel singled out his mark, shot, and seeing an Indian fall, wheeled and ran.
He was immediately followed by four of the savages, who laid aside their guns that they might
the more certainly overtake him. Having by practice, acquired the art of loading his gun as
he ran, Wetsel was indifferent how near the savages approached him, if he were out of reach
of the rifles of the others. Accordingly, keeping some distance ahead of his pursuers whilst
re-loading his gun, he relaxed his speed until the foremost Indian had got within ten or twelve
steps of him. He then wheeled, shot him dead, and again took to flight. He had now to exert
his speed to keep in advance of the savages 'till he should again load, & when this was accomplished
and he turned to fire, the second Indian was near enough to catch hold of the gun, when as
Wetsel expressed it, "they had a severe wring." At length he succeed in raising the muzzle
to the breast of his antagonist, and killed him also.

In this time both the pursuers and pursued had become much jaded, and although Wetsel had consequently
a better opportunity of loading quickly, yet taught wariness by the fate of their companions,
the two remaining savages would spring behind trees whenever he made a movement like turning
towards them. Taking advantage of a more open piece of ground, he was enabled to fire on one
of them who had sought protection behind a sapling too small to screen his body. The ball fractured
his thigh, and produced death. The other, instead of pressing upon Wetsel, uttered a shrill
yell, and exclaiming, "no catch him, gun always loaded," returned to his party.

   [1] One hundred and eighty-six men, mounted, from the
       Monongahela settlements. Early in March, 1782, they assembled
       under David Williamson, colonel of one of the militia
       battalions of Washington County, Pa., on the east bank of the
       Ohio, a few miles below Steubenville. The water was high, the
       weather cold and stormy, and there were no boats for crossing
       over to Mingo Bottom. Many turned back, but about two
       hundred succeeded in crossing. The expedition was not a
       "private" affair, but was regularly authorized by the military
       authority of Washington County; its destination was not the
       Moravian settlements, but the hostile force, then supposed
       to be on the Tuscarawas river. Several Washington predetermination is

 But their purpose was fully comprehended
by the garrison, and instead of returning the fire of the one hundred, they secretly sent an
express to Lexington for assistance, and commenced repairing the pallisades, and putting themselves
in the best possible condition to withstand the fury of the assailants. Aware that the Indians
were posted near the spring, and believing that they would not fire unless some of the men
should be seen going thither, the women [258] were sent to bring in water for the use of the
garrison. The event justified their expectations--The concealed Indians, still farther to strengthen
the belief, that their whole force were engaged in the attack on the south-east, forbore to
fire, or otherwise contradict the impression which they had studiously sought to make on the
minds of its inmates.

When a sufficiency of water had been provided, and the station placed in a condition of defence,
thirteen men were sent out in the direction from which the assault was made. They were fired
upon by the assailing party of one hundred, but without receiving any injury; and retired again
within the pallisades. Instantly the savages rushed to the assault of, what they deemed, the
unprotected side of the station, little doubting their success. A steady, well directed fire,
put them quickly to flight. Some of the more desperate and daring however, approached near
enough to fire the houses, some of which were consumed; but a favorable wind drove the flames
from the mass of the buildings and the station escaped conflagration.

Disappointed of the expected success of their first stratagem, the assailants withdrew a short
distance, and concealed themselves under the bank of the creek, to await the arrival of the
assistance, which was generally sent to a besieged fort or station, arranging themselves in
ambushment to intercept its approach.

When the express from Bryant's station reached Lexington, the male inhabitants had left there
to aid in the defence of Holder's station, which was reported to be attacked. Following on
their route, they overtook them at Boonesborough, and sixteen mounted, and thirty footmen were
immediately detached to aid the inhabitants of Bryant's station. When this reinforcement came
near, the firing had entirely ceased, no enemy was visible, and they approached in the confidence
that all was well. A sudden discharge of shot from the savages in ambush, dispelled that hope.
The horsemen however, passed safely by. The cloud of dust produced by the galloping of their
horses, obscured the view and hindered the otherwise deadly aim of the Indians. The footmen
were less fortunate. Two of them were killed, and four wounded; and but for the luxuriant growth
of corn in the field through which they passed, nearly all must have fallen, before the overwhelming
force of the enemy.

[259] Thus reinforced, the garrison did not for an instant doubt of safety; while the savages
became hopeless of success by force of arms, and resorted to another expedient to gain possession
of the station. Set and him stalked him will be: twenty (Capt) from quarters whom

 Their ascertained loss was four warriors,--three of
whom were killed by the first firing of the whites,--the other about sundown. George Folebaum
was the only white who suffered. Early in the attack, he was shot in the forehead, through
a port-hole, and instantly expired; leaving Jacob Miller, George Leffler, Peter Fullenwieder,
Daniel Rice and Jacob Leffler, junior, sole defenders of the fort; and bravely and effectually
did they preserve it, from the furious assaults of one hundred chosen savage warriors.

Soon after the Indians left Rice's fort, they moved across the hills in different directions
and in detached parties. One of these observing four men proceeding towards the fort which
they had lately left, waylaid the path and killed two of them on the first fire. The remaining
two fled hastily; and one of them swift of foot, soon made his escape. The other, closely pursued
by one of the savages, and in danger of being overtaken, wheeled to fire. His gun snapped,
and he again took to flight. Yet more closely pressed by his pursuer, he once more attempted
to shoot. Again his gun snapped, and the savage being now near enough, hurled a tomahawk at
his head. It missed its object and both strained every nerve for the chase. The Indian gained
rapidly upon him; and reaching forth his arm, caught hold of the end of his belt. It had been
tied in a bow-knot, and came loose.--Sensible that the race must soon terminate to his disadvantage
unless he could kill his pursuer, the white man once more tried his gun. It fired; and the
savage fell dead at his feet.

Some time in the summer of this year, a party of Wyandots, consisting of seven warriors, (five
of whom were, one of the most distinguished chiefs of that nation and his four brothers) came
into one of the intermediate settlements between Fort Pitt and Wheeling, killed an old man
whom they found alone, robbed his cabin, and commenced retreating with the plunder. They were
soon discovered by spies; and eight men, two of whom were Adam and Andrew Poe, (brothers, remarkable
for uncommon size, great activity, and undaunted bravery) went in pursuit of them. Coming on
their trail not far from the Ohio, Adam Poe, fearing an ambuscade, left his companions [268]
to follow it, while he moved across to the river under cover of the high weeds and bushes,
with the view to attack them in the rear should he find them situated as he expected.--Presently
he espied an Indian raft at the water's edge, but seeing nothing of the savages, moved cautiously
down the bank; and when near the foot, discovered the large Wyandot chief and a small Indian
standing near and looking intently towards the party of whites, then some distance lower down
the bottom. Poe raised his gun, and aiming surely at the chief, pulled trigger. It missed fire,
and the snap betrayed his presence. Too near to retreat, he sprang forward; and seizing the
large Indian by the breast, and at the same instant encircling his arms around the neck of
the smaller one, threw them both to the ground. Local who had this falsity, and his spears to

 The Indian seeing that
he had missed his object, and observing an adze in the room, deliberately commenced cutting
an aperture in the back wall through which he might pass out without being exposed to a shot
from the other building.[3]

Another of the Indians came into the yard just after the firing of his companion, but observing
Edward's gun pointing through the port hole, he endeavored to retreat out of its range. He
failed of his purpose. Just as he was about to spring over the fence, the gun was fired and
he fell forward. The ball however only fractured his thigh bone, and he was yet able to hobble
over the fence and take shelter behind a [273] coverlet suspended on it, before Edward could
again load his gun.

While the Indian was engaged in cutting a hole in the wall, Mrs. Cunningham made no attempt
to get out. She was well aware that it would draw down upon her head the fury of the savage;
and that if she escaped this, she would most probably be killed by some of those who were watching
around, before the other door could be opened for her admission.--She knew too, that it was
impossible for her to take the children with her, and could not brook the idea of leaving them
in the hands of the savage monster. She even trusted to the hope that he would withdraw, as
soon as he could, without molesting any of them. A few minutes served to convince her of the
fallacy of this expectation. When the opening had been made sufficiently large, he raised his
tomahawk, sunk it deep into the brains of one of the children, and throwing the scarcely lifeless
body into the back yard, ordered the mother to follow after. There was no alternative but death,
and she obeyed his order, stepping over the dead body of one of her children,[4] with an infant
in her arms and two others screaming from horror at the sight, and clinging to her. When all
were out he scalped the murdered boy, and setting fire to the house, retired to an eminence
in the field, where two of the savages were, with their wounded companion.--leaving the other
two to watch the opening of Edward Cunningham's door, when the burning of the house should
force the family from their shelter. They were disappointed in their expectation of that event
by the exertions of Cunningham and his son. When the flame from the one house communicated
to the roof of the other, they ascended to the loft, threw off the loose boards which covered
it, and extinguished the fire;--the savages shooting at them all the while, and their balls
frequently striking close by.

Despairing of accomplishing farther havoc, and fearful of detection and pursuit, the Indians
collected together and prepared to retreat. Mrs. Cunningham's eldest son was first tomahawked
and scalped; the fatal hatchet sunk into the head of her little daughter, whom they then took
by the arms and legs, and slinging it repeatedly against a tree, ended its sufferings with
its life. Mrs. Cunningham stood motionless with grief, and in momentary expectation of having
the same dealt to her and her innocent infant. But no! She was [274] doomed to captivity; and
with her helpless babe in her arms, was led off from this scene of horror and of wo. The wounded
savage was carried on a rough litter, and they all departed, crossing the ridge to Bingamon
creek, near which they found a cave that afforded them shelter and concealment.[5] After night,
they returned to Edward Cunningham's, and finding no one, plundered and fired the house.

When the savages withdrew in the evening, Cunningham went with his family into the woods, where
they remained all night, there being no settlement nearer than eight or ten miles. In the morning,
proceeding to the nearest house, they gave the alarm and a company of men was soon collected
to go in pursuit of the Indians. Root, attention, flagship. He is nearly, however, do not by discover,

Old Mrs. West and her two daughters, who were alone when the old gentleman was taken, became
uneasy that he did not return; and fearing that he had fallen into the hands of savages (as
they could not otherwise account for his absence) they left the house and went to Alexander
West's, who was then on a hunting expedition with his brother Edmund. They told of the absence
of old Mr. West and [281] their fears for his fate; and as there was no man here, they went

[285] CHAPTER XVII.

Upon the close of the war of the revolution, many circumstances conspired to add considerably
to the population of Kentucky; and her strength and ability to cope with the savages and repel
invasion, were consequently much increased. Conscious of this, and sensible of their own condition,
weakened by the withdrawal of their allies, the Indians did not venture upon expeditions against
its inhabitants, requiring to be conducted by the co-operation of many warriors. They preferred
to wage war in small parties, against detached settlements and unprotected families; and guarding
the Ohio river and the "wilderness trace,"[1] to cut off parties of emigrants removing to that
country. In all of those they were eminently successful. In the interval of time, between the
peace of 1783 and the defeat of General Harmar, in 1790, it is inferred from evidence laid
before Congress, that in Kentucky, not less than one thousand human beings were killed and
taken prisoners. And although the whites were enabled to carry the war into the heart of the
Indian country, and frequently with success, yet did not this put a stop to their enormities.
When pressed by the presence of a conquering army, they would sue for peace, and enter into
treaties, which they scarcely observed inviolate 'till those armies were withdrawn from among them.

In April 1785, some Indians hovering about Bear Grass, met with Colonel Christian and killed
him. His loss was severely felt throughout the whole country.[2]

In October of the same year, several families moving to the [286] country were attacked and
defeated on Skegg's creek. Six of the whites were killed, and a number of the others made prisoners,
among whom were Mrs. McClure and her infant. When the attack was begun, she secreted herself
with four children in some bushes, which together with the darkness of the night, protected
her from observation; and could she have overcome the feelings of a mother for her child, she
might have ensured her own safety and that of her three other children by leaving her infant
at some distance from them. She was aware of the danger to which its cries would expose her,
and sought to prevent them by giving it the breast. For awhile it had that effect, but its
shrieks at length arose and drew the savages to the spot. Three of her children were slain
by her side.

On hearing of this disastrous event, Capt. Whitley collected twenty-one men from the nearer
stations, and went in pursuit of the aggressors. He presently overtook them, killed two of
their party, and retook the prisoners and the scalps of those whom they had slain.--So signal
was his success over them.

In ten days afterwards, another company of movers, led on by Mr. Moore, was attacked, and in
the skirmish which ensued, nine of their party were killed. Again Capt. Whitley went in pursuit
of the savage perpetrators of this outrage, having thirty men to accompany him. On the sixth
day of the pursuit, they overtook twenty mounted Indians, some of whom were clad in the clothes
of those they had slain; and who dismounted and fled upon the first fire. Three of them however
were killed, and eight scalps and all the plunder were recovered.

In consequence of the many repeated aggressions of the savages, an expedition was this fall
concerted against their towns on the Wabash, to be carried into immediate execution. Through
the exertions of the county lieutenants an army of one thousand men, was soon assembled at
Louisville[3] and placed under the command of Gen. Clarke, who marched directly for the theatre
of contemplated operations--leaving the provisions and much of their munitions to be transported
in boats. The army arrived near the towns, before the boats;--the men became dissatisfied and
mutinous, and Gen. Clarke was in consequence, reluctantly forced to return without striking
a blow.[4]

[287] When the army under Gen. Clarke marched from Louisville, Col. Logan knowing that the
attention of the Indians would be drawn almost exclusively towards it, & other towns be left
exposed and defenceless, raised a body of troops and proceeded against the villages on the
Great Miami, and on the head waters of Mad river. In this campaign he burned eight large towns,
killed twenty warriors and took between seventy and eighty prisoners.[5]

Among the troops led on by Col. Logan, was the late Gen. Lyttle (since of Cincinnati) then
a youth of sixteen.[6] At the head of a party of volunteers, when the first towns on the Mad
river were reduced, he charged on some of the savages whom he saw endeavoring to reach a close

 It
was productive of but little benefit, and all were convinced, that successful offensive war
could alone give security from Indian aggression. Convinced of this, preparations were made
by the General Government for another campaign to be carried on against them; the objects of
which were the destruction of the Indian villages between the Miamies; the expulsion of their
inhabitants from the country, and the establishment of a chain of forts to prevent their return,
until a general peace should give promise of a cessation of hostilities on their part. Means,
deemed adequate to the accomplishment of those objects, were placed by Congress at the disposal
of the executive, and of the army destined to effect them, he directed General Arthur St. Clair
to take the command.[19]

It was some time before the troops detailed for this campaign, could be assembled at Fort Washington;
but as soon as they rendezvoused there, the line of march was taken up.[20] Proceeding immediately
for the principal establishments of the Indians on the Miami, General St. Clair had erected
the Forts Hamilton and Jefferson,[21] and placing sufficient garrisons in each, continued his
march. The opening of a road for the passage of the troops and artillery, necessarily consumed
much time; and while it was in progress, small parties of the enemy were often seen hovering
near, and some unimportant skirmishes took place; and as the army approached the Indian villages,
sixty of the militia deserted in a body. To prevent the evil influence of this example, General
St. Clair despatched Major Hamtrack at the head of a regiment, to overtake and bring them back;
and the rest of the army moved forward.

On the night of the third of November, General St. Clair encamped near the Great Miami village,
and notwithstanding the reduced state of the forces under his command, (by reason of the detachment
of so large a body in pursuit of the deserters,) he proposed to march in the morning directly
to its attack.[22] Having understood that the Indians were collected in great force, and apprehensive
of a night attack, his men were drawn up in a square, and kept under arms until the return
of day, when they were dismissed from parade for [298] the purpose of refreshment. Directly
after, and about half an hour before sun rise, an attack was begun by the Indians on the rear
line, and the militia there immediately gave way, and retreated,--rushing through a battalion
of regulars, to the very centre of the camp. The confusion was great. Thrown into disorder
by the tumultuous flight of the militia, the utmost exertion of the officers could not entirely
compose the regulars, so as to render them as effective as they would otherwise have been.

After the first fire, the Indians rushed forward, tomahawk in hand, until they were checked
by the well directed aim of the front line; which being almost simultaneously attacked by another
body of the enemy, had to direct their attention to their own assailants, and the action became
general. The weight of the enemy being brought to bear on the centre of each line where the
artillery had been placed, the men were driven with great slaughter from the guns and these
rendered useless by the killing of the matrosses. The enemy taking advantage of this state
of things, pushed forward upon the lines, and confusion began to spread itself in every quarter.
A charge was ordered, and Lieutenant Colonel Drake succeeded in driving back the Indians three
or four hundred yards at the point of the bayonet; but rallying, they returned to the attack,
and the troops in turn gave way. At this moment the camp was entered by the left flank: and,
another charge was directed. This was made by Butler and Clark's battalions with great effect,
and repeated several times with success; but in each of these charges, many being killed, and
particularly the officers, it was impossible longer to sustain the conflict, and a retreat
was directed.

To enable the troops to effect this they were again formed into line, as well as could be under
such circumstances, and another charge was made, as if to turn the right flank of the enemy,
but in reality to gain the road. Circumstance (varlet). Study will continue a support (implementation)

        St. Clair had 2,000 men,

  [21] Fort Hamilton, a stockade with four bastions, was on the
       Big Miami, 24 miles from Fort Washington (Cincinnati), on the
       site of the present Hamilton, O. Fort Jefferson, built of logs
       laid horizontally, was six miles south of the present
       Greenville, O. The army left Fort Jefferson, October
       24.--R. G. T.

  [22] The army then numbered 1,400 men, and was encamped at
       the site of the present Fort Recovery, O., 55 miles away, as
       the crow flies, from the head of the Maumee, the objective
       point of the expedition.--R. G. T.

  [23] He lay sick in his tent, when the action opened, but
       arose and acted with remarkable courage throughout the fight.
       General Butler was acting commandant while St. Clair was ill,
       and was credibly informed by his scouts, the night before the
       battle, of the proximity of the enemy. But he took no
       precautions against surprise, neither did he communicate his
       news to his superior. Upon Butler's head appears to rest much
       of the blame for the disaster.--R. G. T.

  [24] The Americans lost 37 officers and 593 men, killed and
       missing, and 31 officers and 252 men, wounded. For
       Simon Girty's part, consult Butterfield's History of the
       Girtys, passim.--R. G. T.

  [26] This expedition under Gen. Charles Scott, one of the
       Kentucky committee of safety, was made in June, 1791, against
